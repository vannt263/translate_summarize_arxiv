    "in this paper we consider a polymer model related to the parabolic anderson equation . in particular , we give quantitative bounds on the overlap of the polymer measure in terms of an inverse temperature parameter .",
    "this gives a quantitative expression for the extent to which the polymer measure concentrates its weight near a particular path at low temperature .",
    "the anderson polymer model is a measure on simple , symmetric , continuous - time random walks influenced by a random field , @xmath12 of @xmath6 brownian motions defined on some probability space @xmath13 where the filtration is given by @xmath14 ( expectation with respect to @xmath15 will be denoted by @xmath16 ) this measure and related quantities have motivated a huge number of research papers from many different perspectives . in the seminal reference @xcite the model",
    "is used to give a mathematical account to intermittency , i.e. the existence of spots where most of the mass is concentrated .",
    "those spots correspond to favorable configurations of the field .",
    "the model is also very appealing , with time - space _ iid _ environment ( the brownian increments ) replaced by the configuration of an interacting particle system @xcite , modeling a chemical reaction with moving catalysers .",
    "it has non trivial large deviation properties @xcite , as a particular random growth model .",
    "the one - dimensional totally asymmetric case , where the walker only jumps to the right , has a lower complexity than the symmetric case , as shown by the computations of annealed lyapunov exponents @xcite ; in this case an explicit solution was given in @xcite , with the strongly asymmetric case as a small perturbation @xcite .",
    "we consider the symmetric case and , like @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , our focus is to view the parabolic anderson model as a particular model of directed polymers in random medium , and a host of other references which may be found in @xcite for a general picture .    in order to describe this model ,",
    "start with the measure @xmath0 to be the measure on the canonical probability space , @xmath17 of right continuous paths which possess left limits everywhere , with a finite number of jumps of size one only on any finite interval .",
    "these are the typical sample paths of the simple symmetric rate @xmath18 random walk . here , as is usual , @xmath19 and with respect to @xmath20 the canonical process @xmath21 is a markov process with infinitesimal generator @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the discrete laplacian defined by @xmath24 the anderson polymer model is the gibbs measure on @xmath25,{{\\mathbb z}^d})$ ] defined by @xmath26.\\ ] ] for bounded measurable @xmath27 the model has three parameters , the inverse temperature @xmath28 measuring the fluctuations of the environment , the polymer length @xmath29 and the diffusivity @xmath30 of the path under the _ a priori _ measure @xmath0 .",

    ", the logarithm of @xmath37 formally solves the kardar - parisi - zhang equation ( kpz ) , which is expected to be the scaling limit of our model in a weak noise limit . in dimension @xmath38 ,",
    "its distribution has been recently computed in @xcite , and a better understanding of the kpz universality class is being achieved ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "the functions @xmath39 and @xmath8 thus have the same distribution and we will make use of the properties of @xmath39 derived in @xcite and apply them to @xmath40 we shall use the notation @xmath41 and @xmath42 when @xmath43 by spatial homogeneity of the field @xmath44 we may confine ourselves to the study of the case @xmath43 our results concern the behavior of @xmath45 for @xmath46 and @xmath29 large in arbitrary dimension .",
    "it will be shown that this measure concentrates its mass near a particular favorite path as @xmath47 in a sense this means that there is a channel in the media in which most of the polymer paths reside .",
    "the establishment of the concentration is done by examining the overlap defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the product measure of @xmath45 with itself .",
    "the paths @xmath50 and @xmath51 appearing in ( [ eq : defj ] ) are thus independent samples of paths drawn according to the measure @xmath52 the quantity @xmath53 is , for two independent samples sharing the same environment , the proportion of time spent together . we also study another version of the overlap .",
    "define @xmath54 this version of the overlap measures the amount of time up to @xmath29 that the endpoint of independent samples drawn with respect to the measure @xmath55 agree .",
    "in statistical mechanics , counterparts of these overlaps can be found , for the sherrington - kirkpatrick model and other ones for disordered systems .",
    "coming via integration by parts , the first overlap revealed most successful in the last decade ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) to study the low temperature regime .",
    "below , we shall see that the overlap in our polymer model arises in a similar fashion . by taking the logarithmic malliavin derivative of the partition function with respect",
    "to @xmath56 one arrives at @xmath57 by taking the logarithmic it derivative of the partition function one arrives at @xmath58 both these overlaps take values in [ 0,1 ] , they vanish in the limit of large @xmath29 s under the free measure , i.e. for @xmath59 , and positivity of each one implies a specific form of localization .",
    "it is known that positivity of @xmath60 is equivalent to positivity of the difference between the annealed and the quenched free energies . here",
    ", we show that positivity of @xmath53 essentially amounts to this difference being strictly increasing as a function of @xmath61 .",
    "then , using the logarithmic asymptotics of the partition function from @xcite , we find that both versions of the overlap converge to 1 as @xmath62 , hence achieving its upper bound .",
    "this allows us to give a precise account of path localization by identifying the * favourite end - point * , and the * favourite path * for the polymer .",
    "we introduce here a sequence of measurable functions @xmath63 \\to { \\mathbb z}^d$ ] such that the proportion of time when the polymer is _ equal _ to the favourite path is positive in the localized phase , and converges to 1 as @xmath64 : @xmath65 the function @xmath66 , defined in ( [ def : favouritepath ] ) , depends on @xmath67 and on the environment , it is called the favourite path .",
    "our statement improves on the literature on polymers by concerning the path itself , not only the terminal location at time @xmath29 as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "also , we can obtain , in this model , complete localization in the limit , in the sense of ( [ eq : pathloc ] ) where the right hand side is equal to its maximum value 1 .",
    "we now mention related results on complete localization .",
    "strong concentration for the directed polymer in a random environment for parabolic anderson model ( space dependent only ) with a pareto potential was established in @xcite .",
    "the main difference is that there , the favourable sites in the environment have a simple characterization in terms of the potential . in the time - discrete case with heavy tailed potentials ( time - space dependent ) , see @xcite for similar conclusions .",
    "when the tails are less heavy , the favourite corridors can no longer be characterized by maxima of the potential , they depend in a much more subtle manner on the environment ; though they are not anymore explicit , site localization can still be proved @xcite .",
    "note that in the discrete case , only little is known on the random geodesics @xcite in first passage percolation , which are the zero - temperature favourite paths . in our parabolic anderson model , the potential has strong decay , but we can prove strong localization .",
    "for the solution of the kpz equation in one dimension , the distribution of the favourite end - point has been recently computed in @xcite , it is the @xmath68 of an @xmath69 process minus a parabola .    the parabolic anderson model , compared to other directed polymers , has some nice scaling properties , it also decouples some parameters due to its poissonian structure . with a gaussian potential , it allows a simple integration by parts formula , which comes from the malliavin calculus .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows , in section @xmath70 we present our main results .",
    "section @xmath71 contains preliminaries from the malliavin calculus giving a first version of the overlap .",
    "section @xmath72 gives an ito calculus derivation of the second version of the overlap , and contains the proofs for localization . in section",

    "from now on , we adopt the notation @xmath74      our first goal is to determine the large deviation rate for the number of jumps of paths with respect to the measure @xmath52 we begin with the exponential growth rate of @xmath42 conditioned on the number of jumps of the process @xmath50 up to time @xmath29 which we denote by @xmath75    [ th : existsgm ] for @xmath76 , the limit @xmath77 \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] exists a.s .",

    "<S> we establish that the polymer measure gives a macroscopic mass to a small neighborhood of a typical path as @xmath9 , for parameter values outside the perturbative regime of the random walk , giving a pathwise approach to polymer localization , in contrast with existing results . </S>",
    "<S> the localization becomes complete as @xmath10 in the sense that the mass grows to 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the proof makes use of the overlap between two independent samples drawn under the gibbs measure @xmath11 , which can be estimated by the integration by parts formula for the gaussian environment . </S>",
    "<S> conditioning this measure on the number of jumps , we obtain a canonical measure which already shows scaling properties , thermodynamic limits , and decoupling of the parameters .    keywords and phrases : brownian polymer , overlap , malliavin calculus , parabolic anderson model . + </S>",
