    "the fundamental significance of the opening of the new `` window '' of high energy @xmath2 astronomy has already been remarkably successful .",
    "this discussion will only consider high energy ( @xmath3  gev ) neutrinos .",
    "] for the observation of the universe is beyond discussion .",
    "neutrinos have properties that are profoundly different from those of photons , and observations with this new `` messenger '' will allow us to develop a deeper understanding of known astrophysical objects , and also likely lead to the discovery of new unexpected classes of sources , in the same way as the opening of each new window in photon wavelength has lead to remarkably interesting discoveries .",
    "if there are few doubts that in the future neutrino astronomy will mature into an essential field of observational astrophysics , it is less clear how long and difficult the history of this development will be , and in particular what will be the scientific significance of the results of the planned km@xmath0 telescopes . these telescopes are `` discovery '' instruments and only _ a posteriori _",
    ", when their data analysis is completed , we will be able to appreciate their scientific importance .",
    "it is however interesting to attempt an estimate , based on our present knowledge , of the expected event rates and number of detectable sources .    as a warning",
    ", it can be amusing to recall that when ( in june 1962 ) bruno rossi , riccardo giacconi and their colleagues flew the first @xmath4ray telescope @xcite opening the x  ray photon window to observations , the most promising @xmath4ray source was the sun , followed by the moon ( that could scatter the solar wind ) .",
    "it is now known that the moon surface does indeed emit x  rays , but in fact it appears as a dark shadow in the @xmath4ray sky , because it eclipses the emission of the ensemble of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) that can now be detected with a density of @xmath5 per square degree @xcite .",
    "so the @xmath4ray sky was very generous to the observers , and embarassed the theorists who had worked on _ a priori _ predictions .",
    "the lesson here is that predictions about the unknown are difficult .",
    "one should expect the unexpected , and it is often wise to take ( calculated ) scientific risks .",
    "we all hope that history will repeat itself , and that also the @xmath2 sky will be generous to the brave scientists who , with great effort , are constructing the new telescopes .    on the other hand ,",
    "we are in the position to make some rather well motivated predictions about the intensity of the astrophysical @xmath2 sources , because high energy @xmath2 production is intimately related to @xmath1ray emission and cosmic ray ( c.r . )",
    "production , and the observations of cosmic rays and high energy ( gev and tev range ) photons do give us very important guidance for the prediction of the neutrino fluxes .",
    "this review will concentrate only on high energy astrophysics .",
    "there are other important scientific topics about km@xmath0 telescopes that will not be covered here .",
    "a subject of comparable importance is `` indirect '' search for cosmological dark matter via the observations of high energy @xmath2 produced at the center of the sun and the earth by the annihilation of dm particles @xcite .",
    "the km@xmath0 telescopes can also be used to look for different `` new physics '' effects such as the existence of large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the instruments also have the potential to perform interesting interdisciplinary studies .",
    "the observable neutrino flux can be schematically written as the sum of several components : @xmath6 & + &   \\phi_{\\rm galactic } ( e , \\omega )   +   \\phi_{\\rm extra~gal } ( e , \\omega )     \\nonumber \\\\[0.2 cm ]   & + & \\sum_{\\rm galactic }",

    "they are an important foreground to the more interesting observations of the astrophysical components .",
    "atmospheric @xmath2 s can be split into two components , the first `` standard '' one is due to the decay of charged pions and kaons , while the second one is due to the weak decays of short lived ( hence `` prompt '' ) particles containing heavy quarks , with charmed particles accounting for essentially all of the flux .",
    "the prompt contribution is expected to be dominant in the atmospheric neutrino fluxes at high energy .",
    "this component has not yet been identified , and its prediction is significantly more difficult than the standard flux , because of our poor knowledge of the dynamics of charmed particles production in hadronic interactions .    , @xmath7 and @xmath8 show the angle averaged fluxes of atmospheric neutrinos and anti  neutrinos as a function of energy .",
    "the associated dashed lines are the fluxes neglecting the `` prompt '' contribution of charmed hadrons .",
    "the lines labeled @xmath2gzk describes gzk neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the points ( and fitted lines ) describe cr direct and indirect measurements .",
    "the horizontal lines labeled amanda and icecube are the current limit and the predicted sensitivity of km@xmath0 @xmath2 telescopes for an isotropic @xmath2 flux .",
    "the line labeled anita  lite is the limit on the @xmath2 flux obtained with radio methods @xcite . the isotropic @xmath1ray flux measured by egret @xcite is also shown .",
    "[ fig : cr_nu ] , width=196 ]    figure  [ fig : cr_nu ] shows the angle averaged atmospheric @xmath2 fluxes @xcite with an estimate of the `` prompt '' component @xcite that `` overtakes '' the standard one at @xmath9  tev for @xmath10 and @xmath11  tev for @xmath7 .",
    "the next two components of the neutrino fluxes are `` diffuse '' fluxes coming from @xmath2 production in interstellar space in our own galaxy , and in intergalactic space .",
    "the diffuse galactic emission is due to the interaction of cosmic rays ( confined inside the milky way by the galactic magnetic fields ) with the gas present in interstellar space .",
    "the angular distribution of this emission is expected to be concentrated in the galactic plane , very likely with a distribution similar to the one observed for gev photons by egret @xcite .",
    "the extragalactic diffuse emission is dominated by the decay of pions created in @xmath12 interactions by ultra high energy protons ( @xmath13  ev ) interacting with the 2.7k cosmic radiation .",
    "these `` gzk '' neutrinos are present only at very high energy ( with the flux peaking at @xmath14  ev ) .",
    "together with the diffuse fluxes one expects the contribution of an ensemble of point  like ( or quasi  point like ) sources of galactic and extragalactic origin .",
    "neutrinos travel along straight lines and allow the imaging of these sources .",
    "it is expected that most of the extragalactic sources will not be resolved , and therefore the ensemble of the extragalactic point sources ( with the exception of the closest and brightest sources ) will appear as a diffuse , isotropic flux that can in principle be separated from the atmospheric @xmath2 foreground because of a different energy spectrum , and flavor composition .",
    "in the standard mechanism for the production of high energy @xmath2 in astrophysical sources a population of relativistic hadrons ( that is cosmic rays ) interacts with a target ( gas or radiation fields ) creating weakly decaying particles ( mostly @xmath15 , and kaons ) that produce @xmath2 in their decay .",
    "the energy spectrum of the produced neutrinos obviously reflects the spectrum of the parent cosmic rays .",
    "a well known consequence of the approximate feynman scaling of the hadronic interaction inclusive cross sections is the fact that if the parent c.r .",
    "have a power law spectrum of form @xmath16 , and their interaction probability is energy independent diffuse in different ways inside the source and have different space distributions . for a non homogeneous target , this can be reflected in an energy dependent interaction probability . ]",
    "the @xmath2 spectrum , to a good approximation , is also a power law of the same slope .",
    "the current favored models for 1st order fermi acceleration of charged hadrons near astrophysical shocks predict a generated spectrum with a slope @xmath17 .",
    "this expectation is in fact confirmed by the observations of young snr by hess , and leads the expectations that astrophysical @xmath2 sources are also likely to have power law spectra with slope close to 2 .",
    "such a slope is also predicted in gamma rays bursts models @xcite where relativistic hadrons interact with a power law photon field .",
    "it is important to note that the high energy cutoff of the parent c.r .",
    "distribution is reflected in a much more gradual steepening of the @xmath2 spectrum for @xmath18 .",
    "the hadronic interactions that are the sources of astrophysical neutrinos also create a large number of @xmath19 and @xmath20 particles that decay in a @xmath21 mode generating high energy @xmath1rays . in general",

    "the @xmath2 flavor is calculated at the source before the inclusion of oscillations .",

    "parent population , and the nature of the c.r .",
    "target ( gas or radiation field ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath28 at the source is a well known consequence of the fact that the chain decay of a charged pion : @xmath29 followed by @xmath30 generates two @xmath2 of @xmath31flavor and one of @xmath32type .",
    "the presence of a @xmath7 and an @xmath33 in the final state insures that the ratio @xmath34 , while the ratio @xmath35 is controled by the relative importance of @xmath36 over @xmath37 production that is not symmetric for a @xmath38 rich c.r . population .",
    "measurements of solar and atmospheric neutrinos have recently established the existence of neutrino oscillations , a quantum  mechanical phenomenon that is a consequence of the non  identity of the @xmath2 flavor \\{@xmath10 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 } and mass \\{@xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 } eigenstates .",
    "a @xmath2 created with energy @xmath25 and flavor @xmath23 can be detected after a distance @xmath42 with a different flavor @xmath43 with a probability that depends periodically on the ratio @xmath44 .",
    "this probability oscillates according to three frequencies that are proportional to the difference between the @xmath2 squared masses @xmath45 , and different amplitudes related to the mixing matrix @xmath46 that relates the flavor and mass eigenstates . the shortest ( longest ) oscillation length , corresponding to the largest ( smallest ) @xmath47 ) can be written as : @xmath48 these lengths are long with respect to the earth s radius ( @xmath49  cm ) , but are very short with respect to the typical size of astrophysical sources .",
    "therefore oscillations are negligible for atmospheric @xmath2 above @xmath50  tev , but can be safely averaged for ( essentially all ) astrophysical neutrinos . after space averaging , the oscillation probability matrix can be written as : @xmath51 where we have used the best fit choice for the mixing parameters ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) . the most important consequence of ( [ eq : probosc - ave ] ) is a robust prediction , valid for essentially all astrophysical sources , for the flavor composition of the observable @xmath2 signal : @xmath55",
    "the tev energy range ( the highest avaliable ) for photons is the most interesting one for neutrino astronomy , because the @xmath2 signal for the future telescopes is expected to be dominated by neutrinos of one ( or a few ) order(s ) of magnitude higher energy .",
    "recently the new cherenkov @xmath1ray telescopes have obtained remarkable results , and the catalogue of high energy gamma ray sources has dramatically increased .",
    "of particular importance has been the scan of the galactic plane performed by the hess telescope @xcite , because for the first time a crucially important region of the sky has been observed with an approximately uniform sensitivity with tev photons .",
    "the three brightest galactic tev sources detected by the hess telescope have integrated fluxes above 1  tev ( in units of @xmath56  ( @xmath57  s)@xmath58 ) of approximately 2.1 ( crab nebula ) , 2.0 ( rx j1713.73946 ) and 1.9 ( vela junior )    the fundamental problem in the interpretation of the @xmath1ray sources is the fact that it is not known if the observed photons have hadronic ( @xmath19 decay ) or leptonic ( inverse compton scattering of relativistic electrons on radiation fields ) origin . if the leptonic mechanism is acting , the hadronic component is poorly ( or not at all ) constrained , and the @xmath2 emission can be much smaller than the @xmath1ray flux . for the hadronic mechanism ,",
    "the @xmath2 flux is at least as large as the photon flux , and higher if the @xmath1rays in the source are absorbed ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : nuhadgam ] ) .",
    "the @xmath1ray tev sources , belong to several different classes .",
    "the crab is a pulsar wind nebula , powered by the spin down by the central neutron star .",
    "the emission from these objects is commonly attributed to leptonic processes , and in particular the crab is well described by the self synchrotron comptons model ( ssc ) .",
    "the next two brightest sources @xcite are young supernova remnants ( snr ) , and there are good reasons to believe that the photon emission from these objects is of hadronic origin .",
    "the @xmath1 spectra are power law with a slope @xmath592.2 which is consistent with the expectation of the spectra of hadrons accelerated with 1st order fermi mechanism by the sn blast wave .",
    "the extrapolation from the photon to the neutrino flux is then robust , the main uncertainty being the possible presence of a high energy cutoff in the spectrum .",

    "their average flux can be , during some periods of time , several times the crab .",
    "the extrapolation to the @xmath2 flux has significant uncertainties because the origin ( hadronic or leptonic ) of the detected @xmath1rays is not established .",

    "it is possible that individual grb emits neutrino fluences that are sufficiently high to give detectable rates in the neutrino telescopes .",
    "the most promising technique for the detection of neutrino point sources is the detection of @xmath2induced muons ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "these particles are produced in the charged current interactions of @xmath7 and @xmath68 in the matter below the detector . to illustrate this important point we can consider a `` reference '' @xmath2 point source point source as the flux ( summed over all @xmath2 types ) above a minimum energy of @xmath69  tev .",
