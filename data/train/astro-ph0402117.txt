    "all is flux , nothing stays still ; nothing endures but change .",
    "this seems to apply particularly well to extragalactic radio sources .",
    "important advances in our understanding of radio source intrinsic and extrinsic variability mechanisms have been made by studying their amplitudes , characteristic time - scales , and cross - correlations with observations at other wavelengths .",
    "radio variability can be classified in three broad classes ( padrielli et al .",
    "1987 ) , based on their frequency dependence : 1 ) variability only occurs at low frequencies ( @xmath3ghz ) , 2 ) variability occurs both at low and high ( @xmath4ghz ) frequencies , but is not correlated in time , and 3 ) low and high frequency variability , but the variations are correlated ( although they need not occur simultaneously ) .",
    "this classification also conveniently separates the underlying variability mechanisms into `` most likely extrinsic '' ( low frequency variations only ) , and `` most likely intrinsic '' ( correlated broadband variability ) .",
    "the accepted model for the extrinsic variability of radio sources is refractive interstellar scintillation ( iss ) , which predominantly induces variations at low frequencies ( @xmath5ghz ) , with low amplitudes ( @xmath6 ) , and with typical timescales of a few days @xcite .",
    "variations of this type have been detected in multi - frequency studies ( e.g. , mitchell et al . 1994 ; lazio et al .",
    "perhaps the strongest arguments for the external origin of these variations are correlations with galactic latitude ( e.g. , gregorini et al .",
    "1986 ; gaensler et al .",
    "2000 ) , and an annual modulation due to earth s orbital motion ( e.g. , lainela & valtaoja 1993 ; bondi et al . 1994 ; 1996 ) .",
    "low - frequency variations with much longer timescales ( @xmath7 years ) , and/or larger amplitudes are thought to be source intrinsic , however ( e.g. , rs & machalski 1990 or , more recently , gaensler & hunstead 2000 ) .    broadband radio variability , in which the variations usually appear first and more strongly at higher frequencies , are thought to be intrinsic to the radio source .",
    "a model describing this behavior , in which shocks propagate along the radio jets , has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "the model further implies that sources viewed close to the line of sight ( i.e. , flat - spectrum quasars and bl lacs ) should be more variable and have shorter variability timescales . for objects very close to the line of sight , relativistic beaming will become important , amplifying the variations and shortening the timescales to @xmath5 day ( e.g. , lister 2001 ) .",
    "indeed , intraday variability has been readily detected in samples of compact , flat - spectrum sources .",
    "some of the variability occurs on such short timescales that the apparent source brightness temperature ( e.g. , gopal - krishna et al . 1984 ) can be as high as @xmath8k ( e.g. , quirrenbach et al . 2000 ) , well beyond the inverse compton limit of @xmath9k ( kellermann & pauliny - toth 1969 ) .",
    "doppler boosting factors of up to a few hundred are needed to reconcile these numbers ( the apparent t is proportional to the doppler factor to the third power ) .",
    "these doppler factors are actually at the high end of the observed range , and it has been suggested that these velocities are pattern speeds that do not reflect the lorentz factors of the jet itself ( e.g. , lister et al . 2001 ) . nonetheless , intraday variability has been uniquely identified with the blazar class of objects ( e.g. , quirrenbach et al . 1992 ; lister et al . 2001 ) .    comparatively little",
    "is known about ( intrinsic ) radio variability in non - blazar sources at low flux density levels ( @xmath7 mjy ) .",
    "most of the variability research has focused on either bright radio samples ( e.g. , gregorini et al .",
    "1986 , @xmath10 jy ; lister et al .",
    "2001 , @xmath11 jy ; aller et al .",
    "2003 , @xmath12 jy ) , or small samples at much lower flux levels ( a few 10 s of mjy  e.g. , rs & machalski 1990 ; bondi et al .",
    "1996 ; riley et al .",
    "recently , carilli et al . ( 2003 ) used deep multi - epoch vla observations of the lockman hole area to study variability at the 0.1 mjy level , resulting in just 9 variable sources .    in this paper , we will use two epoch observations of the first zero - dec strip ( sect .",
    "[ observations ] ) of about 9000 radio sources to expand significantly the number of variable sources down to flux density levels of @xmath13 mjy .",
    "unlike much brighter radio samples , the typical radio source population at these levels is dominated by star - forming galaxies and steep - spectrum systems , with only a small percentage of flat - spectrum agn ( e.g. , windhorst et al .",
    "1999 ; richards et al . 1999 ; de vries et al . 2002 ) . with our sample , therefore , we are in an excellent position to investigate the radio variability properties of lower radio luminosity galaxies .",
    "interstellar scintillation is not expected to contribute significantly to the variability in our sources , since our observations were carried out at 1.4 ghz , near the minimum in expected iss ( e.g. , padrielli et al .",
    "1987 ; mitchell et al .",
    "furthermore , given our variability criterion ( see sect .  [ sample ] ) , only sources that vary by significant amounts , especially toward the lower flux levels , are included .",
    "these variation levels exceed the typical iss variations of a few percent by a large factor .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in the next two sections , the radio observations and sample selection",
    "are described . in sect .",
    "[ optid ] we discuss the optical properties of the variable sample , and compare these against a non - variable control sample .",
    "our radio imaging data have been taken as part of the faint images of the radio sky at twenty centimeters survey ( first , see becker et al .",
    "1995 for a detailed description ) conducted with the vla in b - array between 1993 and 2002 .",
    "the observing strategy of the first survey provides a limited capability to search for variability , although since adjacent fields have significant overlap , most sources were observed more than once . for the most part ,",
    "data were collected in strips of constant declination so adjacent fields in the east - west direction are sensitive to variations on a time scale of 3 minutes . first observing runs",
    "were usually separated by multiples of 24 hours so adjacent fields in the north - south direction are sensitive to variations on timescales of 1 to 5 days .",
    "this led , for instance , to the discovery of a number of radio - variable stars @xcite .",
    "a search for variability between the first survey and the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , condon et al . 1998 ) is also possible .",
    "this is , however , complicated by the difference in angular resolution : the first survey can resolve out flux seen by the nvss .",
    "this results in so many nvss sources appearing brighter than their first counterparts that it is necessary to restrict the analysis to sources which appear brighter in first ( see sect .  [ nvsscomp ] ) , making a straightforward flux comparison to test for variability difficult .",
    "the best opportunity to search for long term variability has been afford by our decision to re - observe the south galactic cap ( sgc ) first zero dec strip ( hereafter fzdb ) during the summer of 2002 ( the initial set of observation were made in 1995 , which will be referred to as fzda ) .",
    "the observations were made for the dual purpose of a quality control test of the first survey , as well as a search for variability .",
    "the zero - dec strip was chosen for this purpose because it has been observed by the sloan digital sky survey as well ( sdss , see stoughton et al .",
    "2002 for the early data release , and abazajian et al .",
    "2003 for data release 1 updates ) .",
    "a total of 720 fields were re - observed covering 120.2 square degrees and encompassing 9086 radio objects in the fzdb catalog .",
    "the fzdb survey area is shown in fig .  [ area ] .",
    "the first catalog has a uniform sensitivity across the surveyed zero - dec strip area , whereas the fzdb has not ( fig .  [ area ] ) .",
    "this makes a direct comparison of their relative completeness limits and source surface densities difficult . with an average surface density of @xmath14 radio sources per square degree @xcite ,",
    "the first catalog should contain about 10800 objects within the nominal zero - dec strip survey area . however , this number can not be directly compared to the fzdb count of 9086 , due to the latter s non - uniform survey coverage .",
    "the best way to compare the two catalogs is to create an fzda catalog ( derived from first ) which has its source surface density tapering off toward the survey edges , just like the fzdb catalog .",
    "the simplest way of obtaining such a catalog is to list the unique sources contained in first around the fzdb catalog positions .",
    "this makes sense , since we are interested in objects present in both catalogs in the first place .",
    "the total number of sources in such an fzda catalog vary with the radius up to which the fzdb positions are matched : 6605 sources within 3 , 7343 within 1 , and 11778 within 10 .",
    "we will use the first two lists to compare the relative completeness of the fzdb catalog .",
    "the 6605 entry list represents our matched catalog from which we will select our variable sample ( sect .",
    "[ varcrit ] ) , and the 7343 constitutes our comparison fzda sample .",
    "the combined catalog uses a matching radius of 3 , which is about half of the fwhm of the b - array beam .",
    "this automatically excludes the fraction of extended sources for which the source detection program assigned different components and/or different positions though . as a consequence ,",
    "the number of 6605 is considerably lower than the original first surface density ( even lower than expected based on the non - uniform coverage ) . to be consistent ,",
    "we exclude _ all _ extended components . ] from our combined sample .",
    "there are good scientific reasons for this as well .",
    "extended radio emission is most likely due to lobe ( radio hotspot ) emission which can not vary on the short timescales we are sampling here ( @xmath15 years ) .",
    "since we are interested in shorter timescales , we will have to study those sources in which the ( feeding ) processes close to the agn itself vary .",
    "these sources are consequently very small , and unresolved by our imaging data ( with its resolution of @xmath16 arcseconds ) .",
    "the resulting reduced sample sizes have been listed in table  [ samples ] .",
    "figure  [ matchfrac ] illustrates how well the fzda and fzdb compare . at the higher flux density levels we expect to find almost all of the point sources in the combined catalog",
    "this is the case for sources with flux densities exceeding 2 mjy .",
    "for both the fzda and fzdb catalogs , over 98% of those sources end up in the combined catalog .",
    "none of the remaining catalog - unique entries turned out to be real on close inspection : they were either resolved sources for which a particular component was assigned a differing position between fzda and fdzb ( separated by more than 3 ) , or the catalog entry turned out to be an imaging artifact that made it into one but not both catalogs ( e.g. , ringing around very bright objects ) .",
    "the situation is quite different for fainter sources , however .",
    "an increasing fraction of faint objects are only present in either catalog , which indicates a systematic effect rather than genuine source variability . disentangling the truly variable sources from the random noise at these flux density levels can only be achieved by obtaining deeper surveys . indeed",
    ", none of these faint sources end up meeting our variability criterion ( sect .",
    "[ varcrit ] ) , which is based on the survey sensitivity level .",
    "all the variable sources that _ do _ meet the criterion have flux densities @xmath17mjy ( see fig .",
    "[ vp2med ] ) , and are in the well - matched part of fig .",
    "[ matchfrac ] .",
    "so , in summary , transient phenomena ( e.g. , gamma ray burst afterglows ) have not been found for flux density limits exceeding 2 mjy .",
    "fainter events may be present , but we do not have any way of assessing their reality .",
    "since we are interested in radio source variability , we begin by defining our variability ratio ( hereafter vr ) as :    @xmath18    for the @xmath19 source in our catalog .",
    "the indices a and b denote the measurement epochs 1995 and 2002 .",
    "because the source brightness does not enter into this equation , we can not use this ratio at face value : toward the lower flux density levels the ( sky background ) noise will account for a significant fraction of the `` variability '' in such sources .",
    "we therefore have to weight the vr value of each source individually based on its signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) and local noise values ( see next section ) .",
    "since we are only considering unresolved sources , ideally their ( fitted ) peak flux density and integrated flux density should be the same .",
    "this is , however , not the case .",
    "in fact , the integrated flux density values are found to have larger intrinsic scatter than the fitted peak flux values .",
    "both the peak and integrated flux density are based on gaussian fits to the actual data , but unlike the peak fit , the integrated value is also based on fits to the major and minor axes of the object .",
    "noise in the measurement of the axes therefore increases the noise in the integrated flux density compared to the peak value . in fig .",
    "[ relvar ] we have plotted the relative flux density difference ratio ( defined as the larger flux density divided by the smaller flux density ) for both the source integrated and peak flux density values .    it is clear from this figure that the scatter in the peak flux measurements ( the solid blue median line ) is considerably less than that of the integrated flux density ratios ( as indicated by the solid purple median line ) . to minimize the number of variable false positives , we only consider the source peak flux density values .",
    "following @xcite , the relative flux density errors can be written as :    @xmath20    this equation reflects the two components of the measurement error , with @xmath21 due to a constant systematic error , and @xmath22 dependent on the s / n ratio .",
    "this expression can be used to estimate the significance of radio source variation , as defined by the quotient of the new and old flux densities . if one defines the flux density and noise values in the first epoch as @xmath23,@xmath24 , and in the second as @xmath25,@xmath26 , the 4@xmath27 variability envelopes are then given by :    @xmath28    which can be further reduced by substituting @xmath29 , @xmath30 mjy , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath27 values have been measured to be on average 0.150 and 0.148 mjy for the 1995 ( a ) and 2002 ( b ) epochs , respectively .",
    "the @xmath22 value has been chosen to match the value of @xcite and @xcite , and seems fairly robust across different instruments and survey setups",
    ". the @xmath31 value ( which is lower than the @xmath33 of the latter two papers ) , is set by the high s / n end of the source distribution .",
    "its adopted value is a good match between including /",
    "excluding high s / n variable sources : the fraction of variable sources as function of s / n is kept acceptably flat ( see figs .  [ varplot2 ] and [ vp2med ] , with s / n defined as @xmath34 )",
    ".    the upper and lower @xmath35 envelopes can now be expressed ( as a function of s / n ) as :    @xmath36    equation  [ fluxerror3 ] forms the basis of our variability criterion .",
    "any source having a vr exceeding either @xmath35 envelope is considered genuinely variable .",
    "this yields 146 variable sources , of which 58 are brighter in the 2002 epoch , and 88 are fainter ( fig .",
    "[ varplot2 ] ) .",
    "the solid red curve in fig .  [ varplot2 ] represents the median flux density ratio as function of s / n , plotted on a linear scale to improve clarity ( as opposed to the logarithmic equivalent in green ) .",
    "as can be gathered from this curve , the medians quickly fall below 1 as the s / n decreases , with a maximum deviation of 8% at s / n @xmath37 .",
    "most of the offsets are within @xmath1% , however .",
    "even though the offsets are small , there is a systematic trend which is affecting our variability sample selection , something we wish to avoid .",
    "if uncorrected , it implies that fainter sources are more likely to fade between 1995 and 2002 than brighter sources , something which would be hard to explain in any variability scenario .",
    "we have two parameters to play with : a small ( additive ) zero - point correction which will straighten out the median curve , and a multiplicative sensitivity correction which will raise or lower the curve along the y - axis . the best correction ( with the resulting median curve having the smallest variations along the @xmath38 line )",
    "is obtained by adjusting the fzdb flux densities by :    @xmath39    which amounts to a 90 @xmath40jy zero - point offset , and a 1.16% sensitivity correction .",
    "the 90 @xmath40jy offset is small compared to both the 150 @xmath40jy rms noise value and the 250 @xmath40jy clean bias ( a flux density correction applied per beam for the first survey , see white et al .",
    "1997 ) . and",
    "the 1.16% factor is well within the nominal @xmath41 systematic uncertainty in the flux density scale .    after applying these corrections ( fig .",
    "[ vp2med ] ) , we end up with 128 candidate variable sources / components ( corresponding to 2.0% of the sample ) , listed in table  [ varsample ] , of which 70 are brighter in the 2002 epoch , and 58 fainter .      as a reality check , we compared the fzdb catalog against the nvss catalog to see whether the same sources are deemed variable , using basically an identical variability criterion .",
    "there are , however , a few differences .",
    "the nvss survey has a typical background noise of 0.45 mjy ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , instead of the 0.15 mjy for the first survey .",
    "another complicating factor is the resolution difference between the nvss and fzdb .",
    "sources that are not resolved by the @xmath42 nvss beam are often resolved by the fzdb , with each component only a fraction of the nvss total flux density .",
    "we tried to minimize this effect by first excluding resolved nvss sources outright from the correlation , and secondly using the fzdb integrated ( instead of peak ) flux density measurements .",
    "furthermore , we used a very restrictive @xmath43 matching radius in another attempt to just match unresolved sources both in the fzdb and nvss .",
    "the resulting matched sample contains 2201 sources .",
    "of these 2201 sources , 10 are brighter at the fzdb epoch , and 91 are fainter .",
    "this is after applying a similar fzdb flux density correction as in the previous section ( albeit with slightly different constants ) .",
    "clearly , there is still some flux density being resolved out by the longer base - line fzdb observations compared to the nvss , which results in quite a few bogus variable sources .",
    "this implies we can not really compare the fzdb - nvss faint variable sources to table  [ varsample ] , since an unknown fraction of them will be spurious .",
    "the 10 fzdb - nvss bright variable sources on the other hand , are not be affected by this . indeed ,",
    "9 out of the 10 sources are recovered in table  [ varsample ] ( separately footnoted ) , with the sole `` newly '' identified variable source first j222646@xmath44005210 . upon closer inspection",
    ", this source appears to be stable between fzda and fzdb ( @xmath45 mjy for both epochs ) .",
    "its nvss flux density of 615 mjy is just within the quoted @xmath41 systematic flux density uncertainty between the two surveys .",
    "based on this , we therefore conclude that our variability criterion is robust , and results in a sample of truly variable sources .",
    "this does tacitly assume that the cataloged radio flux densities are always correct .",
    "however , as the next section will show , this is actually not valid for some cases .",
    "our variable sample actually contains 128 variable , unresolved , _ components_. while most of these component entries turn out to be single ( unresolved ) radio pointsources , some of them are part of a multi - component radio source .",
    "the varying part is then presumably associated with the agn / radio - core position .",
    "however , there may still be some cases where the fzda and fzdb cataloging software divided up radio flux differently between adjacent components , introducing artificial variability .",
    "it is therefore important to check all the multi - component radio sources in our sample ( 28 ) individually .    in order to characterize the _ overall _ radio properties of our sample ,",
    "we start by defining 6 morphological categories : 1 ) single pointsource ( ps in column 11 of table  [ samples ] ) ; 2 ) pointsource with an elongation , or linear feature ( cj , `` core - jet '' ) ; 3 ) variable core with two non - variable lobes ( cl ) ; 4 ) core embedded in diffuse halo ( ch ) ; 5 ) complex , multi - component structure ( cx ) ; and 6 ) possible hotspot variability ( hs ) .",
    "each of the sources in table  [ samples ] have been categorized accordingly .",
    "the relative number break - down of the sample is : 1 ) 100 ( 78.1% ) ; 2 ) 14 ( 10.9% ) ; 3 ) 9 ( 7.0% ) ; 4 ) 1 ( 0.8% ) ; 5 ) 1 ( 0.8% ) ; and 6 ) 3 ( 2.3% ) . except for the last two classes ( containing 4 sources , or 3.1% of the total sample ) ,",
    "all of the variability is consistent with it being due to the agn / core component .",
    "we will discuss a few selected sources in more detail below .",

    "unfortunately , two unrelated sources close to this source also `` varied '' by @xmath47 , casting serious doubt on its reality .",

    "[ radiomaps ] as reminders of how careful one has to be using automated selection criteria .",
    "we next investigate the possible connection between optical properties and the presence of radio variability .",
    "variability correlations in the optical and radio have been proposed before ( e.g. , tornikoski et al .",
    "1994 ; hanski et al .",
    "2002 ) , with the highly beamed blazars as the clearest examples of sources which exhibit variability across the electromagnetic spectrum ( e.g. , bregman et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the first step would be to correlate our variable sample with known optical catalogs , and compare the results against a sample of non - variable radio sources .",
    "we therefore created 12 sets of 123 non - variable sources ( i.e. , each control sample has the same number of elements as the variable sample ) . to ensure non - variability , we only selected sources inside @xmath51 variation curves ( as opposed to sources _ outside _ @xmath35 variations , fig .",
    "[ vp2med ] ) , while matching the radio flux density distribution function of the variable sample .",
    "this was done by matching the number of non - variable sources to the amount of variable sources per s / n bin ( binned logarithmically from 1.0 to 3.4 , with binsize 0.4 dex ) .",
    "given that there are only 1922 sources ( out of our initial sample of 6605 ) that are less variable than these @xmath51 limits , 12 sets of control samples are about as many as one can create without starting to have a significant fraction of sources shared between them .",

    "our sample of 123 variable sources has been matched against the apm catalogs with a @xmath53 matching radius .",
    "while this does discriminate against possible off - nuclear radio sources , it is necessary to limit the number of chance matches , given the density of objects in the apm catalog .",
    "the matching results are listed in table  [ apmmatch ] .",
    "what is immediately striking is the difference in detection rates between the variable and non - variable samples .",
    "about half of the variable sources are retrieved from the apm catalogs , but only 1 in 6 of the non - variable sources have optical counterparts .",
    "the rms variation between the 12 control samples is 2.8% , resulting in a @xmath54 detection rate difference .",
    "clearly , variable sources are easier to detect not only because on average they are brighter , but also due to a higher fraction of quasars ( see sect .  [ sdssmorph ] ) .",
    "the brightness difference is not large ; actually a cumulative distribution plot against mean magnitude ( fig .  [ apmids ] ) shows how comparable their distributions are . based on a ks - test",
    ", these two distributions do not differ to any level of significance .",
    "fortunately , a significant fraction ( @xmath55 ) of the survey is covered by the sdss data release 1 ( dr1 ) , so we can use these deeper and more uniform imaging data to investigate this further .",
    "the sdss data also show a higher fraction of optical identifications for variable sources .",
    "since the latter data are deeper than the photographic plates the apm catalogs are based on , we identify 82% of the variable sources , and on average 38% of the non - variable ones ( table  [ sdssmatch ] ) .",
    "these values are up from the apm values of 54% and 18% , respectively . as mentioned earlier , one way of explaining the higher match rate for the variable sample is that it may contain a higher fraction of quasars",
    ". since these objects are typically unresolved , they are easier to detect at any given magnitude than resolved galaxies ( of the same integrated magnitude ) . table  [ sdssmatch ] lists the morphological breakdown of each sample , based on the sdss classification . with a relative stellar fraction of 53%",
    ", the variable sample contains significantly more quasar candidates than the non - variable control sample ( on average 19% ) .",
    "the results of table  [ sdssmatch ] can also be used to calculate how much more quasars are likely to be variable compared to galaxies .",
    "this is a function of radio flux density ( fig .",
    "[ morphrf ] ) , but the low number of sources ( per bin ) only allow for an overall ratio .",
    "we assume the non - variable sample numbers ( 19% of the radio population are quasars , 81% are galaxies ) are representative of the general population .",
    "these numbers compare very well to the ones quoted by @xcite for a much larger sample of sdss sources detected with first ( 83% of those are galaxies ) .",
    "now , if we introduce the terms quasar variability rate qvr and galaxy variability rate gvr ( both defined as the fraction of quasars / galaxies that are variable ) , and an initial sample size of @xmath56 , we get :    @xmath57",
    "this means that the variable sample will contain in total @xmath58 variable sources .",
    "we know the relative quasar and galaxy fractions to be 53% and 47% .",
    "this leads to ( after dividing out @xmath56 ) :    @xmath59    if one assumes a @xmath60 uncertainty in the relative fractions ( table  [ sdssmatch ] ) , this relative value ranges between 3.4 and 7.5 .",
    "in other words , not surprisingly , quasars are on average 5 times as variable ( in the radio ) than are galaxies .",
    "the radio source population changes as a function of radio flux density ( e.g. , windhorst et al .",
    "1999 ; richards et al .",
    "1999 ; de vries et al .",
    "2002 ) , from mainly agn - dominated sources at higher flux density levels down to starburst dominated sources at the sub - mjy level .",
    "this will affect our variable sample as well , and we expect to see a decline of the quasar fraction as function of lower flux density limits .",
    "this is nicely illustrated in fig .",
    "[ morphrf ] , which plots the relative quasar fraction with flux density .",
    "the solid green line represents our variable sample , and the dashed red line is the mean of our 12 control samples .",
    "the bins have a constant number of members ( except for the last bin in the control sample ) , hence the variable spacing .",
    "the binning of the control samples has been adjusted to approximately match the binning of the actual sample ( 4 bins of 16 each for the variable sample , and 5 bins of 60 plus 1 bin of 41 members for the control samples ) .    while it is not known how much uncertainty is present in the sdss classification ( and hence quasar fraction ) toward the faintest magnitudes ( see sect .",
    "[ clasrel ] below ) , it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ morphrf ] that the quasar fractions for the variable and non - variable samples differ significantly ( the formal fraction errors are 5% for the control sample , and 12% for the variable sample ) .",
    "this leads us to two robust conclusions based on this figure : 1 ) a radio variable sample will contain more quasars than a non - variable sample , irrespective of radio flux density , and 2 ) the relative contribution of quasars to the sample declines as a function of declining flux density : below @xmath2mjy , galaxies account for the majority of the variable sources .",
    "the last section critically hinges on the reliability of the sdss galaxy versus quasar classification scheme .",
    "if for one reason , most of the excess quasar classifications in our variable sample were made toward the very faint end of the magnitude range , one might become suspicious about the reality of the effect .",
    "a direct test is plotting the quasar fraction as function of optical ( r - band in this case ) magnitude , instead of radio flux density as in fig .",
    "[ morphrf ] .",
    "this has been done in fig .",
    "[ morphmag ] , with again our variable sample in green and the control sample in red .",
    "it is reassuring to see that most of the excess quasar identifications in the variable sample are made for magnitudes brighter than @xmath61 .",
    "stoughton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimate a 95% confidence level for classifications up to this magnitude .",
    "it becomes much less certain for fainter sources . without doubt",
    "some of the current classifications are wrong , but there is no indication that our consistently higher quasar fraction in the variable sample , both as function of radio flux density and optical magnitude , is significantly affected by this .      we have established that there is a significant difference between the variable and non - variable radio samples in terms of their optical counterparts .",
    "the former have a higher matching rate with optical identifications ( given a fixed detection limit ) , which is at least in part ascribed to the higher fraction of quasars .",
    "we have already seen that the magnitude distributions are not significantly different ( fig .",
    "[ apmids ] ) , however , this does not rule out that significant optical color differences may be present between the samples .",
    "the clearest difference between galaxies and quasars ( at least in the restframe ) is provided by the ( u@xmath46r ) vs ( r@xmath46z ) color plot ( see fig  13 in stoughton et al .",
    "2002 for intermediate color - color plots ) .",
    "this allows for sampling of the 4000  break in galaxies up to a redshift of about unity .",
    "this break will offset the galaxies from the quasars , which usually exhibit fairly flat , powerlaw continua ( see fig .  3 in de vries et al .",
    "our data are presented in fig .",
    "[ sdsscol ] . the sample means and their 1@xmath27 errors ( indicated by the crosses in fig .",
    "[ sdsscol ] ) are presented in table  [ sdsscoltable ] .",
    "both the variable quasar and galaxy distributions in the color - color plane are ( statistically ) distinct from the non - variable control sample .",
    "this trend for both the galaxies and quasars to become bluer when they vary has been seen before ( e.g. , giveon et al .",
    "1999 ; trevese & vagnetti 2002 ; vagnetti et al . 2003 ; de vries et al .",
    "still , the color spread among the sources in the sample is much larger than the _ individual _ color change as a source goes through an outburst . indeed , the studies of giveon , trevese , vagnetti and their respective collaborators all rely on following individual objects through their outbursts , instead of using a statistical sample .",
    "the presence of the mean optical color offsets in our radio variable sample implies two things : 1 ) on average , radio variable sources also exhibit optical ( color ) variations , and 2 ) the optical variation time - scales are shorter than our 7 year base - line , since the sdss data were not taken at the epoch of radio outburst .",
    "however , optical colors for an individual source , while useful in differentiating between quasars and galaxies , do not provide an effective selection mechanism for ( radio ) variability .",
    "nonetheless , as we have seen in the previous sections , the presence of radio variability has a clear impact on the sample s morphological makeup .",
    "we have created a sample of 123 variable radio sources using two epoch observations of a zero - dec strip toward the south galactic cap .",
    "this sample spans the range of radio flux densities from @xmath1 to 1000 mjy .",
    "it presents both in size and radio flux density coverage a unique starting point for variability studies of more normal , less agn - dominated galaxies , especially toward the lower flux density limits .",
    "we compared both our variable and non - variable samples to the sloan digital sky survey optical data .",
    "we found that the quasar fraction of the sample sharply declines as a function of declining radio flux density levels .",
    "this is consistent with earlier findings that the radio source population demographics change as one samples at progressively lower flux density levels : agn - dominated systems tend to be found at the brighter radio flux density levels ( @xmath62 mjy ) , whereas star - forming and normal galaxies dominate the counts at sub - mjy flux density levels ( at 1.4 ghz , e.g. , windhorst 2003 ) .",
    "our variable sample contains a consistently higher fraction of quasars than the non - variable control sample , independent of radio flux density . while this explains part of our almost @xmath63 higher optical matching rate of the variable sample compared to the non - variable one ( quasars are easier to detect at a given brightness limit than galaxies ) ,",
    "it does imply that our variable sample contains on average slightly brighter sources ( though not significantly so , see sect .",
    "[ apmid ] ) . based on relative number statistics ,",
    "we estimate that quasars are about 5 times more likely to harbor a variable radio source than galaxies .",
    "however , at flux density levels @xmath64 mjy , the majority of ( radio ) variable sources are identified as galaxies . and",
    "finally , galaxies and quasars that harbor a variable radio source exhibit , on average , bluer optical colors than hosts of non - variable sources .",
    "all of this underlines the fact that both galaxies and quasars can harbor variable radio sources , albeit at different occurrence rates .",
    "some of this is obviously due to the beamed nature of the ( variable ) quasars , enhancing the variability both by boosting their brightnesses and shortening the variability timescales .",
    "nonetheless , especially toward lower radio flux density limits , a statistically significant study of variability is possible provided one starts with large enough samples",
    ". large scale optical surveys like the sdss provide the crucial radio source optical `` environmental '' information .",
    "as more sdss data become available on the zero - dec strip , we will investigate this further .",

    "<S> we find , by comparing our variable and non - variable control samples to the sloan digital sky survey the following : 1 ) the quasar fraction of both the variable and non - variable samples declines as a function of declining radio flux density levels ; 2 ) our variable sample contains a consistently higher fraction of quasars than the non - variable control sample , irrespective of radio flux ; 3 ) the variable sources are almost twice as likely to be retrieved from the optical sdss data than the non - variable ones ; 4 ) based on relative numbers , we estimate that quasars are about five times more likely to harbor a variable radio source than are galaxies ; and 5 ) there does not appear to be any significant optical color offset between the two samples , even though the suggestive trend for sources to be bluer when variable has been detected before and may be real . </S>",
