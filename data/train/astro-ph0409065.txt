    "current models of hierarchical galaxy formation predict that galaxies form via the accretion of smaller lumps of gas , stars , and dark matter ( e.g. silk & norman 1981 ; kauffman , white , & guiderdoni 1993 ; cole et  al .",
    "recent simulations of this process assuming a lambda - dominated cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe uniformly reveal the presence of large numbers of low - mass dark matter halos persisting around larger galaxies into the present day ( e.g. klypin et  al .",
    "1999 , moore et al .",
    "it remains unclear if these dark matter halos are filled with gas and/or stars and can be associated with dwarf galaxies and/or  clouds or if they lack the mass to retain any baryons .",
    "this raises the question : do we see such gaseous remnants of galaxy formation in  emission around galaxies today ?",
    "there have been many detections of  clouds around nearby galaxies , many of which have been hypothesized to be primordial gas associated with galaxy formation .",
    "no , however , has been unambiguously associated with galaxy formation .",
    "its origin can be more readily attributed to tidal interactions , galactic fountains , or galaxy accretion .",
    "ngc 4449 is an irregular galaxy with two counter - rotating gas complexes and extended  distributed in large clouds , arms , and streamers ( hunter et  al .",
    "1998 ) . while this  could be explained as infalling primordial gas ,",
    "the distribution and kinematics of the gas are perhaps more simply explained as resulting from a tidal interaction with a nearby dwarf galaxy ( theis & kohle 2001 ) .    in ngc 6946 , many clouds of  are seen moving at velocities inconsistent with the rotation of the galaxy ( kamphuis & sancisi 1993 ) .",
    "this high - velocity gas is widely associated with holes in the  disk , and may be explained as gas that was ejected via a galactic fountain powered by supernovae in the galaxy .",
    "an alternative explanation is that these clouds are infalling primordial material which has punched holes in the galaxy ( kamphuis & sancisi 1993 ) .",
    "there are many other cases of  seen outside of the main body of galaxies which have less certain origins .",
    "ic 10 ( wilcots & miller 1998 ) and ngc 925 ( pisano , wilcots , & elmegreen 1998 ) are two examples of galaxies in groups of galaxies which have no stellar companions within @xmath0100 kpc , but both have  clouds of @xmath010@xmath1@xmath2  within a few tens of kiloparsecs .",
    "these clouds could be the remains of dwarf galaxies which have been torn apart by the larger galaxy , or they could be tidal debris from an ancient interaction , or these clouds could be primordial  gas falling into these galaxies for the first time contributing to the ongoing assembly of these galaxies .    finally , surrounding our own galaxy are the high - velocity clouds ( hvcs ) :  clouds which lack stars and are moving at velocities inconsistent with galactic rotation .",
    "because of this , we can not infer their distances or their masses ( see wakker & van woerden 1997 for a review ) .",
    "hvcs most likely represent a variety of phenomena .",
    "some hvcs are probably related to a galactic fountain ( shapiro & field 1976 ; bregman 1980 ) and are located in the lower galactic halo . other hvcs are certainly tidal in origin : the magellanic stream is the most obvious of these features , formed via the tidal interactions between the milky way , large magellanic cloud , and small magellanic cloud ( e.g. putman et  al .",
    "1998 ) , with other hvcs potentially related to other satellites , such as the sagittarius dwarf ( putman et  al.2004 ) . and",
    "some hvcs , such as complex c , may be infalling primordial gas ( wakker et  al .",
    "1999 ; tripp et  al .  2003",
    "gibson et al . 2001 ) . finally , blitz et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) and braun & burton ( 1999 ) suggested that hvcs are the debris from the formation of the local group , and not just the milky way , and are associated with dark matter halos . in this scenarios hvcs",
    "are distributed throughout the local group with d@xmath0100 kpc  1 mpc and @xmath3@xmath010@xmath4@xmath2 .",
    "klypin et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) and moore et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) raised the issue that cdm models of galaxy formation predict that the local group should have hundreds of small dark matter halos , while the number of known , luminous satellite galaxies is only @xmath020 . if hvcs are associated with dark matter halos then this discrepancy , the `` missing satellite '' problem ,",
    "would be resolved .",
    "also at issue is if the local group is somehow unique in this regard and other galaxies have a sufficient number of satellites to match predictions .",
    "unfortunately , none of the  detections discussed above are clearly associated with galaxy formation .",
    "all of the detections may have alternative origins .",
    "to better constrain the origin of such clouds , a more systematic search for them is required .",
    "i discuss here the early results of such an   survey of loose groups analogous to the local group using the parkes multibeam instrument and done in collaboration with david barnes ( melbourne ) , brad gibson ( swinburne ) , lister staveley - smith ( atnf ) , and ken freeman ( anu ) .",
    "this survey will determine if there are massive analogs to hvcs in other groups of galaxies associated with dark matter halos as described above .",
    "furthermore , this survey will find gas - rich dwarf galaxies and determine if the `` missing satellite '' problem is unique to the local group or a ubiquitous problem in all groups .",
    "finally , these observations will serve as a benchmark for the  properties of galaxies in spiral - rich loose groups and how they compare to galaxies in other environments .",
    "to search for hvc analogs , to test models of galaxy formation , and to better understand the  properties of groups like the local group , we have surveyed six spiral - rich , loose groups in  21 cm emission using the parkes multibeam instrument ( pisano et  al .",
    "2004a , b ) .",
    "a loose group is a collection a few large galaxies and tens of smaller ones , where the large galaxies are well - separated , of order a few hundred kpc , over an area of @xmath01 mpc@xmath5 .",
    "in contrast to compact groups , such as stephan s quintet and those cataloged by hickson ( 1982 ) where interactions are a driving force , loose groups generally have few interactions occurring .",
    "we were particularly interested in loose groups containing only large spiral galaxies ; groups analogous to the local group .",
    "if hvcs are associated with the formation of the local group , then they should be present in these groups as well .",
    "the parkes multibeam observations were conducted in six separate observing runs between october 2001 and june 2003 .",
    "the multibeam instrument was repeatedly scanned in right ascension and declination over an area of @xmath01 mpc@xmath625 square degrees with a velocity coverage of @xmath71500  kms@xmath8  until an rms sensitivity of 5 - 8 mjy beam@xmath8 per 3.3  kms@xmath8  channel was reached .",
    "this translates to a @xmath3  sensitivity at the distances of these groups , 10.6@xmath913.4 mpc , of 5.3 - 8.1@xmath1010@xmath11@xmath2  per channel .",
    "the parkes data had fake sources inserted before multiple double - blind searches by eye for all sources were made .",
    "all sources , not just new ones , were confirmed with follow - up australia telescope compact array ( atca ) observations . based on our identification of fake sources",
    ", we determined that our searches were nearly 100% complete down to an integrated flux limit of ten times the rms noise times the square root of the number of channels ( pisano et  al .",
    "2004a , b ) . only three",
    "groups have had their parkes detections confirmed with atca follow - up observations : lgg 93 , 180 , & 478 . in these three groups ,",
    "all 20 previously optically - identified group members were detected as well as seven new -rich dwarf galaxies .",
    "no  clouds without stars identified on the digital sky survey were found .",
    "because pisano et  al .",
    "( 2004a ) did not detect any hvc analogs in the three groups surveyed , we are unable to confirm the existence of analogs of the type proposed by blitz et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) and braun & burton ( 1999 ) .",
    "we can , however , place limits on the masses and , hence , distances of the hvcs around the milky way if such objects are ubiquitous in the group environment .",
    "this has been done by pisano et  al .",
    "( 2004b ) .",
    "pisano et  al .",
    "examine only the compact hvcs ( chvcs ) identified by braun & burton ( 1999 ) as likely being associated with dark matter halos .",
    "this is because many of the other classes of hvcs , such as the magellanic stream and large complexes , discussed by blitz et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) as being associated with dark matter have other , more likely , origins as discussed above .",
    "pisano et  al .",
    "assume that chvcs are distributed in a gaussian manner about the milky way , and ask for what parent population of chvcs and what d@xmath12 for their distribution would we expect to see _ zero _ analogs around galaxies in the loose groups surveyed given the detection limits of the observations .",
    "figure  [ hvc ] illustrates the combined constraints from the observations of lgg 93 , 180 , & 478 on the distances and population of chvcs around the milky way .",
    "if the chvc population in other groups has the same properties and as those around the milky way , then at the 95% confidence level , for 270 clouds , we see that chvcs must be clustered within 160 kpc of the milky way with an average @xmath3  of @xmath134@xmath1010@xmath11@xmath2 .",
    "this is in good agreement with recent limits derived by other authors using a variety of other methods examining both milky way hvcs ( e.g. de heij et  al .",
    "2002 ) and extragalactic analogs ( e.g. zwaan 2001 ) and makes the original blitz et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) and braun & burton ( 1999 ) models which place hvcs at @xmath01 mpc extremely unlikely .",
    "these limits imply that chvcs are more closely associated with individual galaxies , rather than groups of galaxies , and that there is not a large reservoir of neutral hydrogen , @xmath131@xmath1010@xmath14@xmath2 , waiting to be accreted onto galaxies like the milky way .",
    "these observations do not rule out the presence of a large reservoir of ionized gas , however .",
    "the observations of loose groups by pisano et  al .",
    "( 2004a ) do not find large numbers of -rich galaxies that would correspond to the low mass dark matter halos seen in the simulations by klypin et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) or moore et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) . as such",
    "we can infer that the local group is not unique in its lack of low mass , luminous satellites as compared to the predictions of cdm simulations .",
    "pisano & wilcots ( 2003 ) previously found this to be the case for gas - rich companions to isolated galaxies .",
    "these results are illustrated in figure  [ cvdf ] .",
    "the cumulative velocity distribution functions for the local group , loose groups , and isolated galaxies have roughly consistent slopes which are inconsistent with the cdm models . from this",
    "it is clear that our measurements of luminous halos do not match cdm predictions and either an alternative form of dark matter ( such as warm dark matter , coln et  al .",
    "1999 ) or a mechanism suppressing the collapse of baryons into dark halos ( e.g. tully et  al .",
    "2002 ) is needed to reconcile the observations with models .",
    "these results will be discussed in more detail in future papers ( pisano et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "i would like to thank the organizers of the tullyfest for inviting me to present this work at such an excellent meeting .",
    "i would also like to thank the staff at parkes and the atca for their wonderful support of these observations .",
    "i would like to acknowledge generous support from both an atnf bolton fellowship and nsf mps distinguished international research fellowship grant ast0104439 ."
