    "our pseudopotentials and the pc pseudopotentials also appear to produce very similar errors , providing support for this interpretation . for the transition metal atoms it should be possible to reduce these errors by including the @xmath127 and 3@xmath51 electrons as valence states , giving `` small core '' pseudopotentials.@xcite    in table  [ tab:4 ] we compare the first ionization potentials calculated for the atoms considered in the previous tables .",
    "the results are of similar quality to those for the excitation energies given in table  [ tab:3 ] , and show a similar trend that the errors tend to increase with @xmath2 .",

    "here we use a simpler procedure and apply least squares fitting with respect to @xmath137 , with the initial @xmath138 taken as the values of the equivalent arep parameters .",
    "we considered the selection of atoms and ions shown in table  [ tab:5 ] .",
    "the so splitting is defined as the difference between the energies of states where @xmath139 differs by one due to the transfer of an electron between orbitals of the same @xmath38 , but different @xmath40 quantum number . the difference in energy of the states due to the",

    "these are the averaged relativistic effective potentials and so pseudopotentials of kleinman  @xcite and bachelet and schlter.@xcite we use the troullier - martins scheme  @xcite to generate smooth pseudopotentials , and remove the unphysical extremely non - local behaviour which results from the exact exchange in a controlled manner.@xcite    the resulting ( tabulated ) pseudopotentials are then represented in a convenient analytic form suitable for use in standard quantum chemistry codes , using a fitting procedure based on the method first described by barthelat _",

    "<S> these pseudopotentials are suitable for use within hartree - fock and correlated wave function methods , including diffusion quantum monte carlo calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> pseudopotentials or effective core potentials ( ecps ) are commonly used within electronic structure calculations to replace the chemically inert core electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the core on the valence electrons is then described by an angular - momentum - dependent effective potential , leading to greatly improved computational efficiency in _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> calculations for heavy atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the use of pseudopotentials is well established within hartree - fock ( hf ) and density functional theory ( dft ) , and in correlated wave function calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> our main interest is in diffusion quantum monte carlo ( dmc ) calculations.@xcite this technique provides an accurate solution of the interacting electron problem for which the computational effort scales with the number of electrons , @xmath0 , as approximately @xmath1 , which is better than other correlated wave function approaches . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , scaling with atomic number , @xmath2 , is approximately  @xcite @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the use of a pseudopotential reduces the effective value of @xmath2 , making dmc calculations feasible for heavy atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> there is evidence that hf pseudopotentials give better results within dmc than dft pseudopotentials.@xcite it appears that the complete neglect of core - valence correlation within hf theory leads to better pseudopotentials than the description of core - valence correlation provided by dft . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , core - valence correlation can be included within correlated wave function calculations performed with hf pseudopotentials by using core polarization potentials.@xcite core polarization potentials mimic the effects of dynamical polarization of the core by the valence electrons , as well as static polarization effects due to the other ions . </S>",
    "<S> we would therefore like to use hf pseudopotentials in our dmc calculations , preferably constructed from dirac - fock ( df ) theory in order to include the relativistic effects which are significant for heavy atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> standard quantum chemistry packages are convenient for generating the `` guiding wave functions '' required in dmc calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we would therefore like our pseudopotentials to be available in the standard parameterized form of a sum of gaussian functions multiplied by powers of the electron - nucleus separation .    </S>",

    "<S> `` energy consistent '' hf pseudopotentials including relativistic effects have also been developed by the stuttgart and bonn groups  @xcite , and are also publicly available.@xcite there is considerable freedom in constructing pseudopotentials , and many of those available in the quantum chemistry literature diverge at the nucleus , normally as @xmath4 or @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this singular behaviour leads to large `` time - step '' errors and even instabilities in dmc calculations.@xcite moreover , we can not imagine that this singular behaviour is advantageous in quantum chemistry methods , as it leads to pseudo wave functions with behaviour at small @xmath6 which can not be described within a gaussian basis set . </S>",

    "<S> we also require our pseudopotentials to be well - localized ( by which we mean non - local only in a small region around the nucleus ) , as the evaluation of the non - local energy within dmc is expensive .    </S>",
    "<S> we also seek to quantify the errors present in our pseudopotentials . </S>",
    "<S> transferability errors are expected to be the most significant , but errors due to other sources are also assessed . </S>",
    "<S> these errors result from the approximations required to construct hf pseudopotentials from all - electron ( ae ) df data , from the removal of the unphysical long ranged non - local behaviour discussed by trail and needs  @xcite , and from the parameterisation of the pseudopotentials .    </S>",
