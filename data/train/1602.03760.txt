    "consider a data set where each data point is a vector of @xmath1 quantitative variables and one categorical variable with @xmath2 levels .",
    "ideally , several of the quantitative variables are real - valued . according to the categorical variable",
    ", we will view the data set as @xmath2 not necessarily distinct collections of points in @xmath3 , referred to as point clouds .",
    "additionally , assuming the data were randomly sampled , we will view each of these @xmath2 point clouds as a representative subset of their respective space . of interest",
    "is whether or not the spaces corresponding to these @xmath2 point clouds have measurably different shapes ? but what does shape even mean if @xmath1 is large ?",
    "topology , in particular algebraic topology , is an area of mathematics that can be used to qualitatively measure the shape of a point cloud . for a given point cloud ,",
    "we construct an infinite family of simplicial complexes that vary according to a real - valued distance parameter .",
    "each complex in the family is an object that inherits a shape from the point cloud and the topological tool known as homology can be used to detect this shape . since any single complex within the infinite family corresponds to a choice of parameter value , we might ask which parameter value , if any ,  best \" captures the shape of the point cloud ?",
    "persistence homology is a study of the homological features that persist over long intervals of the distance parameter , thus sidestepping the search for a best choice parameter value .",
    "hence , persistence homology can be used to determine if the @xmath2 point clouds in the data set have different shape .",
    "while persistence homology allows comparisons of shape across the @xmath2 sampled point clouds , can any resulting sample differences then be generalized to the corresponding spaces at large ?",
    "the answer is yes , but as random sampling unavoidably introduces variability , a method is needed which can distinguish  true \" differences in shape between the spaces from  artificial \" differences between the sampled point clouds .",
    "statistical hypothesis testing is an inferential method often implemented to assess whether or not randomly sampled data provide sufficient evidence of a difference , with respect to some characteristic , between two or more populations , which we have been and will continue to loosely refer to as spaces . in the 2013 results of k. turner and a. robinson ,",
    "such an assessment is conducted on @xmath4 spaces using a specific type of hypothesis testing procedure known as a permutation test , where the characteristic of interest is shape  @xcite . in this procedure , the randomly sampled data are numerous point clouds from both spaces and the shape of a point cloud is measured via persistence homology . in this paper",
    "we extend this procedure to three or more spaces , @xmath5 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ hom ]",
    "we provide definitions and examples of the vietoris - rips complex of a point cloud , homology groups , persistence homology and persistence diagrams . in section",
    "[ htandtda2spaces ] we describe the permutation test of robinson and turner . in section",
    "[ htandtda3spaces ] we propose an extension of the permutation test for three or more groups . in section  [ htandtda3spacessimstudy ]",
    "we present the results of a large - scale simulation study , incorporating various measurement errors and sample sizes , that validate our proposed extension .",
    "finally , in section  [ cardioapp ] we apply our extension to a cardiotocography data set and find significant evidence of differences in shape , as measured by persistence homology , between the spaces corresponding to normal , suspect and pathologic health groups .",
    "before defining the persistence homology of a point cloud , we associate to the point cloud a nested family of abstract simplicial complexes .",
    "a thorough explanation of simplicial complexes and abstract simplicial complexes is available in many sources  @xcite .",
    "here we motivate the definition of an abstract simplicial complex with a brief geometric introduction to simplicial complexes , followed by the definition of the vietoris - rips complex which is the abstract simplicial complex used herein .",
    "geometrically , a 0-simplex is a point , a 1-simplex is a line segment , a 2-simplex is a triangular subset of a plane , a 3-simplex is a solid tetrahedron , and an @xmath6-simplex is the @xmath6-dimensional analogue of these convex sets . observe that the boundary of an @xmath6-simplex , @xmath7 , is a collection of @xmath8-simplices ; these boundary simplices are called faces of @xmath7 .",
    "simplicial complex _ is a collection of simplices in @xmath9 that satisfy certain subset and intersection properties specifying how simplices can be put together to create a larger structure .",
    "more precisely , a simplicial complex is a finite collection of simplices , @xmath10 , such that ( 1 ) if @xmath11 and @xmath12 is a face of @xmath7 then @xmath13 , and ( 2 ) given any two simplices @xmath14 then @xmath15 is either the empty set or a face of both @xmath16 and @xmath17 . more generally , and without relying on geometry , an",
    "abstract simplicial complex _ is a finite collection of sets , @xmath18 , such that if @xmath19 and @xmath20 , then @xmath21 .",
    "it is well known that a finite abstract simplicial complex can be geometrically realized as a simplicial complex in @xmath22 for @xmath23 sufficiently large .",
    "the _ vietoris - rips complex _ , denoted @xmath24 , is an abstract simplicial complex associated to a point cloud @xmath25 for a fixed radius value @xmath26 .",
    "the elements of @xmath25 form the 0-simplices or vertex set of @xmath24 .",
    "a simplex of @xmath24 is a finite subset @xmath27 of @xmath25 such that the diameter of @xmath27 is less than @xmath28 . a simplex @xmath29 with @xmath30-elements",
    "is called a @xmath31-simplex of @xmath25 .",
    "thus , a 1-simplex corresponds to a two element set ( viewed geometrically as the endpoints of a line segment ) , a 2-simplex corresponds to a three element set ( viewed as the vertices of a triangle ) , and so on . observe that if @xmath27 is a @xmath30-simplex , then every subset of @xmath27 is a simplex of @xmath25 as the diameter of a subset of @xmath27 can be no larger than the diameter of @xmath27 . hence the vietoris - rips complex satisfies the definition of an abstract simplicial complex .        as an example , consider the set , @xmath25 , of five points in the plane as pictured in figures  [ data5 ] and  [ vrexamples ] .",
    "each point in @xmath25 is a 0-simplex , each line segment drawn between points is a 1-simplex , and each shaded triangle a 2-simplex .",
    "as the parameter @xmath28 increases beyond @xmath32 the vietoris - rips complex will contain additional 2-simplices , a 3-simplex at @xmath33 , and eventually a 4-simplex when @xmath34 is equal to the diameter of @xmath25 .",
    "note that the abstract simplicial complex @xmath35 in figure  [ vrexamples ] can not be geometrically realized in @xmath36 since it contains pairs of 2-simplices whose intersection is not a face of either simplex .",
    "and @xmath37 for a five point data set , @xmath25.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath37 for a five point data set , @xmath25.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we note that vietoris - rips complexes for increasing radius values are always a nested family of simplicial complexes associated to @xmath25 , that is the complexes satisfy @xmath38 this nested feature of the complexes along with the functorial nature of homology are what give rise the the concept of persistence to be defined below .",
    "although the vietoris - rips complex is relatively straightforward to define and calculate , it can be computationally expensive when used with large point clouds .",
    "there are economical alternatives to the vietoris - rips complex , such as the lazy witness complex introduced in  @xcite .",
    "persistence homology can be applied using any nested family of complexes indexed by some parameter .",
    "the homology of a simplicial complex @xmath10 is an algebraic measurement of how the @xmath6-simplices are attached to the @xmath8-simplices within @xmath10 .",
    "below we define some technical machinery ( chains , boundary maps , and cycles ) used to define homology groups , followed by some example calculations .",
    "the _ @xmath0-chains _ of a simplicial complex @xmath10 , denoted @xmath39 , is the group of formal linear combinations of the @xmath0-simplices of @xmath10 with coefficients from @xmath40 .",
    "( more general definitions of homology with ring coefficients can be found in the standard algebraic topology texts  @xcite . )",
    "since @xmath40 is a field , the @xmath0-chains of @xmath10 are a @xmath40-vector spaces with basis the @xmath0-simplices of @xmath10 .",
    "for example , the chains of @xmath41 are the vector spaces @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "the _ boundary map _ , denoted @xmath45 , identifies each @xmath0-chain with its boundary , a @xmath46 chain .",
    "each boundary map , @xmath47 , is a homomorphism and in the case of @xmath40 coefficients , as considered here , these maps are linear transformations .",
    "notice that @xmath48 is the zero map as the boundary of a boundary is empty .",
    "this fundamental property of chain complexes ensures that the image of @xmath49 is a normal subgroup of the kernel of @xmath50 . the collective sequence of boundary maps and chains , as shown below ,",
    "is called a _ chain complex_.",
    "@xmath51    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ table : buw-2vs3 ]    the two trends that were apparent in the corresponding omnibus permutation tests for this simulation scenario are also readily apparent in all three of these post - hoc tests .",
    "specifically , as sample size increases for a fixed measurement error , the percentage of significant post - hoc tests tends to increase .",
    "similarly , as measurement error increases for a fixed sample size , the percentage of significant post - hoc tests tends to decrease .",
    "a cell by cell comparison of the percentages among the three post - hoc tests , however , reveals an additional interesting trend .",
    "the percentages for the post - hoc test between the circle and the three - wedge are almost uniformly larger than or equal to the corresponding percentages between the circle and the two - wedge , which are in turn almost uniformly larger than or equal to the corresponding percentages between the two - wedge and the three - wedge .",
    "this too is mostly intuitive and desirable since , among the three spaces , the unit circle and the three wedge are the most different with respect to shape .",
    "we are uncertain why the post - hoc test appears more adept at recognizing measurable differences in shape between the circle and the two - wedge rather than between the two - wedge and the three - wedge .",
    "regardless , all three of these trends , when coupled with the volume of entries in all three tables which are at or near 100% , indicate that the proposed post - hoc tests  successfully \" identified measurable differences in shape between each of the three possible pairings of these three spaces .",
    "such findings additionally corroborate the legitimacy of the two - space permutation test .      in summary , the major findings of the simulation study are three - fold .",
    "first and foremost , these simulations demonstrate that the proposed omnibus permutation testing procedure  successfully \" identified measurable differences in shape between at least two of the three spaces .",
    "second , these simulations confirm that the post - hoc testing component  successfully \" identified measurable differences in shape between any two spaces ; such findings corroborate the legitimacy of the two - space permutation testing procedure .",
    "third and finally , these simulations reveal that these hypothesis testing procedures , for any number of spaces , require balanced sample sizes .",
    "we apply our methods to the cardiotocography ( ctg ) data set that is freely available from the university of california at irvine machine learning repository .",
    "the ctg data set includes 23 variables for each of 2126 subjects .",
    "we apply our methods on a focused subset of four quantitative variables , including fetal heart rate baseline in beats per minute , number of accelerations per second , number of uterine contractions per second , and number of light decelerations per second .",
    "these four quantitative variables are chosen because they are seemingly independent , and we want to consider no more than four such variables .",
    "the categorical variable of interest is health status , which has three levels : normal , suspect , and pathologic .",
    "the question of interest is whether or not the four - dimensional space created by the quantitative variables has a measurably different shape across the three health status groups .",
    "to answer this question , we use the omnibus permutation testing procedure developed in section  [ htandtda3spacestestingprocedure ] , measuring shape via one dimensional persistence homology . before this procedure can be performed , however , balanced samples from the three health status groups must be obtained .    of the 2126 sampled subjects , 1655 are of normal health status , 294 of suspect health status , and 176 of pathologic health status . to obtain balanced samples across the three health status groups ,",
    "we select a random sample of size 176 from both the normal and suspect health status groups .",
    "however , since the normal health status group is so large , we first test the representativeness of our sample of 176 subjects using an omnibus permutation test . to that end",
    ", the 1655 normal health status subjects were randomly partitioned into nine  spaces \" of 176 , leaving 71 discarded subjects .",
    "the 176 subjects in each  space \" were then randomly partitioned into four four - dimensional point clouds of 44 subjects each . the omnibus permutation test",
    "was then performed using these 36 point clouds .",
    "the corresponding null hypothesis asserted that there were no measurable differences in shape between the nine  spaces . \"",
    "the resulting approximate permutation test p - value was based on 100,000 random assignments of the 36 point clouds to the nine  spaces . \"",
    "this entire process was then repeated 149 more times , where each such trial was based on a different initial random partition of the 1655 normal health status subjects into the nine  spaces . \" of the 150 trials ,",
    "24 produced approximate permutation test p - values under 0.1 , which suggests that in those trials there is evidence of measurable differences in shape between the nine  spaces . \" in other words , in those 24 trials , there is evidence that the nine  spaces \" may not be equally representative of the normal health status group , with respect to shape . hence , we select our random sample of 176 normal health status subjects by randomly selecting one of the nine  spaces \" from the  more representative \" 126 trials .    with balanced samples of 176 subjects from each of the three health status groups , we can now utilize the omnibus permutation testing procedure to address the original question of interest . to that end , within each of the three health status groups , the 176 subjects were randomly partitioned into four point clouds of 44 subjects each .",
    "the omnibus permutation test was then performed using the persistence diagrams corresponding to these 12 point clouds .",
    "the corresponding null hypothesis asserted that there were no measurable differences in shape between the three spaces , i.e. health status groups .",
    "the resulting permutation test p - value of approximately 0.003 was based on all 34650 possible assignments of the 12 persistence diagrams to the three spaces . given that the p - value is so small",
    ", we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there are measurable differences in shape between at least two of the three spaces .",
    "to determine the source(s ) of the difference , we ultimately performed three post - hoc tests , one for each possible pairing of the three health status groups .",
    "for each such test , the null hypothesis asserted that there were no measurable differences in shape between the two spaces of the respective health status groups .",
    "all three resulting permutation test p - values were based on all 70 possible assignments of the 8 corresponding persistence diagrams to the two spaces . for the normal and suspect health status groups ,",
    "the permutation test p - value was approximately 0.029 ; for the normal and pathologic health status groups , the permutation test p - value was also approximately 0.029 ; for the suspect and pathologic health status groups , the permutation test p - value was approximately 0.257 .",
    "hence , there is significant evidence of measurable differences in shape between the normal and suspect health status groups , and between the normal and pathologic health status groups , but insignificant evidence of such differences between the suspect and pathologic health status groups .",
    "for point clouds sampled from three or more spaces , we propose using an omnibus permutation test on the corresponding persistence diagrams to determine whether statistically significant evidence exists of measurable differences in shape between any of the respective spaces .",
    "if such differences do exist , we then propose using a number of post - hoc ( i.e. two - space ) permutation tests to identify the specific pairwise differences . to validate this proposed procedure",
    ", we conducted a large - scale simulation study using samples of point clouds from three distinct groups .",
    "various combinations of spaces , samples sizes and measurement errors were considered in the simulation study and for each combination the percentage of @xmath0-values below an alpha - level of 0.05 were provided .",
    "the results of the simulation study clearly suggest that the procedure works , but additionally reveal that the method is neither scale invariant nor insensitive to imbalanced sample sizes across point clouds .",
    "finally , accounting for sample size and scale , we applied our omnibus testing procedure to a cardiotocography data set and found statistically significant evidence of measurable differences in shape between the normal , suspect and pathologic health status groups .    while the proposed ombinus testing procedure is applicable in any homological dimension , the simulation study and ctg application presented in this paper focus exclusively on homological dimension one .",
    "hence , to validate the effectiveness of the method in other homological dimensions , and to assess the consistency of the method across various dimensions , additional simulation studies can be performed ."
