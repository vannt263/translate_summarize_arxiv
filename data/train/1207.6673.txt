    "an important contribution to the total visible light emitted by massive , x - ray galaxy clusters does not come from the galaxies themselves @xcite .",
    "this so - called _ intracluster light _ ( icl ) is attributed to intracluster stars , low surface brightness stars located outside galaxies .",
    "intracluster stars have been directly observed @xcite .",
    "these observations reveal that the intracluster stellar population is diverse .",
    "it is mostly comprised of stars with masses of order @xmath9 , ages up to @xmath10 , and metallicities @xmath11 $ ] between @xmath12 and 0 @xcite , but also includes red , old stars @xcite agb stars @xcite , planetary nebulae @xcite , novae and supernovae . @xcite .",
    "the fraction of stars that contribute to the icl increases with the mass of the clusters , and with the density of the environment : from loose groups ( @xmath13 , @xcite ) , to virgo - like ( @xmath14 , @xcite ) and rich clusters ( @xmath15 or higher , @xcite ) . in the cores of dense and rich clusters ( like coma )",
    "the local icl fraction can be as high as 50% @xcite .",
    "several models have been suggested to explain the origin of intracluster stars .",
    "a comprehensive review of these various processes is provided by @xcite .",
    "essentially , these models fall into four categories : intracluster star formation , ejection , disruption of individual galaxies , or galactic interactions .    some models for in - situ formation of intracluster stars have been suggested .",
    "gas - rich galaxies moving through the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) might experience ram - pressure stripping .",
    "the gas extracted from the galaxies will form dense gaseous streams , which under the right conditions can fragment to form stars @xcite .",
    "this could explain the galactic tails that are observed in some galaxies such as eso  137 - 001 and eso  137 - 002 .",
    "@xcite observed a halo of diffuse uv intergalactic light surrounding a radio galaxy ( the spiderweb galaxy ) , providing evidence for in - situ star formation outside galaxies .",
    "also , tidal stripping could provide another mechanism for extracting cold gas from galaxies .",
    "in the recent simulations of @xcite , up to 30% of intracluster stars formed in could gas clouds stripped from substructures infalling into the cluster center .",
    "supernovae explosions inside close binary systems @xcite can produce high - velocity stars , with velocities of several hundreds @xmath16",
    ". some of these stars could have enough kinetic energy to escape the gravitational potential of the parent galaxy and reach the intracluster space @xcite .",
    "however , as @xcite argue , this is not an efficient mechanism for populating the intracluster space with stars . even if ones assumes that every supernovae produces a high - velocity star , with enough velocity to escape , the total number of intracluster stars produced by this mechanism is simply too small .",
    "three- or four - body encounters in dense stellar systems @xcite could also produce high - velocity runaway stars , and recent simulations suggest that these stars could reach velocities as high as @xmath17 @xcite    a galaxy can get disrupted if it loses some of its gravitational binding energy .",
    "a gas - rich galaxy can become unbound by losing a significant fraction of its gas .",
    "this could be caused by ram - pressure stripping , or by a galactic wind powered by sne explosions or an agn .",
    "another possible mechanism is the merger of two galaxies which both host a central supermassive black hole .",
    "this will likely lead to the formation of a single galaxy with a central binary black hole .",
    "if the binding energy of this binary black hole exceeds the binding energy of the galaxy , the gravitational energy extracted from the black holes will disrupt the galaxy @xcite .",
    "while these various processes might contribute to some of the observed icl , it is generally accepted that most intracluster stars were formed inside galaxies , and were later dispersed into the intracluster space by galaxy interactions taking place during the evolution of the clusters . this likely results from tidal stripping or tidal destruction of galaxies during close encounters ( @xcite , @xcite , hereafter paper i , @xcite ) , though an important contribution could also be provided by stars ejected during galactic mergers @xcite .",
    "the icl tends to be more concentrated than the galactic light @xcite , which is interpreted as evidence for the role of galaxy collisions in the origin of the icl @xcite .",
    "notice that the higher rate of galaxy collisions and higher icm pressure found in the central regions of the clusters would tend to increase the efficiency of most of the processes discussed above , the exceptions being ejection of high - velocity stars ( unaffected ) and sne - driven galactic winds ( possibly inhibited ) .",
    "several analytical and numerical studies of the origin and evolution of the icl have been performed .",
    "these include studies based on analytical modeling of galaxy formation and disruption @xcite , n - body simulations of large - scale structure formation combined with an analytical prescription for galaxy formation , dispersion , and merging @xcite , and hydrodynamical simulations @xcite . in these numerical studies",
    ", there is always a trade - of between having good resolution or good statistics .",
    "@xcite , and @xcite simulate either one cluster or a few clusters , so even though these clusters are simulated with high resolution , they might not be representative of the whole cluster population . at the other extreme ,",
    "@xcite simulate a very large cosmological volume , containing a statistically significant sample of clusters , but can not resolve the scale of dwarf galaxies . in this work",
    ", we use an algorithm which combines large - scale cosmological simulations with a semi - analytical treatment of mergers and tidal disruption .",
    "this enables us to achieve good statistics while resolving the processes responsible for destroying dwarf galaxies .    in this paper , we focus on the relative importance of the tidal destruction and merger processes and their role in the evolution of the cluster luminosities , and do not consider the properties of the icm . in this case , a full hydrodynamical simulation is not required , and we chose instead to combine a n - body simulation with a subgrid treatment of processes at galactic scales .",
    "we use a high - resolution n - body simulation of large - scale structure formation , as in @xcite and @xcite , but with a different and complementary approach for galaxy formation , mergers , and tidal destruction , as described in paper  i ( see   2.1 below ) .",
    "our goals are to determine ( 1 ) the fraction of galaxies of various masses destroyed by tides and mergers during the formation and evolution of the clusters , ( 2 ) the contribution of tidal destruction to the icl , and ( 3 ) the brightness profile of the icl resulting from tidal destruction .",
    "simulating the formation and destruction of dwarf galaxies in a cosmological context is quite challenging , because of the large dynamical range involved . to get statistically significant results , we need to simulate a volume of the universe large enough to contain several rich clusters .",
    "to estimate this volume , we use the cluster mass function of @xcite , @xmath18    where @xmath19 . using @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", we get @xmath22 . for a cubic volume of size @xmath23",
    ", this gives 24 clusters more massive than @xmath21 , which is probably sufficient to get good statistics . in a @xmath2cdm universe with @xmath24 ,",
    "a @xmath1 volume contains a mass of @xmath25 .",
    "if we take the minimum mass of a dwarf galaxy to be @xmath26 , we get @xmath27 . lets assume that we perform an n - body simulation with equal - mass particles , and that it takes a minimum 100 particles per galaxy to properly resolve processes such as galaxy merger and tidal destruction , we would then need 3.69  billion particles .",
    "this is comparable to some of the largest n - body simulations ever performed to this date , and would require an enormous investment in human and computer resources .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite use three different kinds of particles ( dark matter , gas , and stars ) with masses @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the gravity - only simulations of @xcite use particles of mass @xmath31 , while our own simulation uses particles of mass @xmath32 .",
    "@xcite used the results of the _ millenium simulation _",
    "@xcite , with particles of mass @xmath33 .",
    "none of these simulations can resolve the internal structure of dwarf galaxies and properly simulate the destruction of these galaxies by mergers and tides . to solve this problem , @xcite use a group finder to determine if particles belong to galaxies or are located in the intracluster space ( skid , see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite used instead a standard `` zoom - in '' technique .",
    "they first performed a relatively low - resolution simulation .",
    "they selected a subset of massive clusters at redshift @xmath5 , and ran the simulation a second time , with more resolution inside the regions where these clusters formed .",
    "@xcite used the same approach , by selecting a sample of 16 clusters from the _ millenium simulation _ and resimulating them with higher resolution .",
    "this approach provides very - high resolution at reasonable computational cost .",
    "however , only a few clusters are being simulated at that high resolution .",
    "@xcite use a semi - analytical model to describe galaxy formation and disruption . in this paper",
    ", we use an approach that we first introduced in paper  i. we represent each galaxy in the system ( regardless of its mass ) using _ one single particle_. in this approach , the merger and tidal destruction of galaxies can not be directly simulated , but instead are treated in the algorithm as subgrid physics .",
    "when two particles representing galaxies come close to each other , we can calculate the gravitational potential energy between them .",
    "we can also calculate the tidal field caused by one galaxy at the location of the other . with these , we can set rules that dictate when mergers and tidal destruction take place .",
    "this is fairly crude compared to an actual simulation of the mergers and tidal destruction events , _ but is expected to make statistically correct predictions for a large number of events . _",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that it does not rely on zoom - ins , and thus enables us to simulate a larger number of clusters at high resolution .",
    "this approach was developed and tested on isolated clusters ( paper  i ) . in this paper",
    ", we apply the same approach to a cosmological simulation , which enables us to follow the formation and evolution of a statistically significant number of clusters .",
    "we consider a concordance @xmath2cdm model with @xmath24 , @xmath34 , and @xmath20 .",
    "we perform a high - resolution simulation in a @xmath1 comoving box with periodic boundary conditions , using a particle - mesh ( pm ) algorithm with @xmath35 particles and a @xmath36 mesh .",
    "the total mass in the box is @xmath37 and the mass per particle is @xmath38 .",
    "the length resolution is @xmath39 comoving .",
    "we assume that dwarf galaxies of mass @xmath40 form inside cells where the density is 200 times the mean density .",
    "each galaxy is represented by a `` galaxy particle . ''",
    "these particles are treated like pm particles , but have the ability to form , merge , and get tidally destroyed .",
    "the treatment of these processes by the algorithm is described in the following sections .      to include galaxy formation in our n - body simulations",
    ", we assume that dwarf galaxies of mass @xmath41 form by monolithic collapse , while more massive galaxies form by the merger of smaller galaxies .",
    "therefore , in our code implementation , the formation of massive galaxies by mergers is handled by the merging module , and the galaxy formation module only handles the formation of galaxies of mass @xmath41 .    the computational volume is divided into @xmath36 pm cells .",
    "we assume that dwarf galaxies form in cells where the density @xmath42 of background matter exceeds a threshold density @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the mean density of the universe at redshift @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "we use the density of the background matter , and not the total density , because the matter already locked up in galaxies is unavailable to form new galaxies , except by mergers .",
    "we assume that in each cell that satisfies this criterion , there is a probability @xmath47 of forming a dwarf galaxy of mass @xmath48 during a time interval @xmath49 , given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a galaxy formation rate .",
    "the number of galaxies created during a timestep is therefore @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the number of cells that satisfy the criterion .",
    "we adjust the value of @xmath51 by requiring that the galaxy luminosity function at @xmath5 is consistent with observations ( see  3.1 below ) .",
    "we select a subset of @xmath54 cells randomly among the @xmath55 cells that satisfy the criterion @xmath56 , and we create a galaxy of mass @xmath48 in each of these cells .",
    "to do so , we consider a gaussian density profile : @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the distance from the center of the cell , and the width @xmath59 is defined by @xmath60 .",
    "this profile contains a total mass @xmath48 .",
    "we identify all dark matter particles located within a distance @xmath61 from the center of the cell .",
    "we then remove from each particle a mass @xmath62 , where the constant @xmath63 is adjusted such that the total mass removed is equal to @xmath48 . instead of locating the newborn galaxy in the exact center of the cell",
    ", we calculate the center - of - mass position and velocity of the matter that was removed from dark matter particles , and these become the position and velocity of the galaxy , respectively .",
    "this ensures that mass and momentum are conserved .",
    "the initial radius of the galaxy is set to @xmath64 , the radius of a uniform sphere with @xmath41 and @xmath65 .    for the simulation presented in this paper",
    ", we used a minimum mass @xmath40 , which corresponds to the mass of 7 dark matter particles .",
    "the corresponding filter width is @xmath66 , or 0.2645 pm cells .",
    "our treatment of subgrid physics is presented in paper i , and we refer the reader to that paper for details . here we briefly summarize the method used . at each timestep , we identify all pairs of galaxies that are sufficiently close that the center of one galaxy is inside the other galaxy , that is , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the separation between galaxies @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and @xmath71 , @xmath72 are their radii . for each pair",
    ", we calculate the total energy of the two galaxies in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath73    where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the kinetic energy of galaxies @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the center - of mass frame , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the internal energies of the galaxies , and @xmath78 is the gravitational potential energy of the galaxy pair , respectively .",
    "the internal energies depend on the masses and radii of the galaxies .",
    "they are given by @xmath79    where @xmath80 and @xmath71 are the mass and radius of galaxy @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the _ geometric factor _",
    "@xmath81 depends on the density profile of the galaxy , but does not vary much for any reasonable profile , so , as in paper  i , we use @xmath82 , which is the correct value for a truncated isothermal sphere in virial equilibrium .    if @xmath83 , the merger criterion is satisfied and the two galaxies merge , to form a new galaxy @xmath84 .",

    "tidal disruption is more tricky .",

    "we simplify the problem by using an all - or - nothing approach .",
    "we identify pairs of galaxies which are sufficiently close that the separation between their _ edges _ is smaller than the radius of the largest galaxies , that is , @xmath88 .",
    "let us assume that galaxy @xmath69 is the most massive of the pair .",
    "we compare the tidal field of galaxy @xmath69 at the location of galaxy @xmath70 with the gravitational field of galaxy @xmath70 itself .",
    "if we estimate that the tidal field is strong enough to unbind more than 50% of the mass of galaxy @xmath70 , then the tidal disruption criterion is satisfied , and we assume that galaxy @xmath70 is totally destroyed .",
    "otherwise , galaxy @xmath70 survives the encounter . in the case of a tidal destruction",
    ", we also check the merger criterion [ eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) ] .",
    "if that criterion is also satisfied , we assume that galaxy @xmath70 is destroyed by the tidal field of galaxy @xmath69 , and then the fragments accrete onto galaxy @xmath69 .",
    "numerically this is treated as a merger .",
    "galaxy particles being destroyed and not reaccreted are flagged , to indicate that they do not represent galaxies anymore but rather tidal fragments .",
    "they remain in the simulation , but are ignored during subsequent encounters .",
    "this enables us to track the motion of tidal fragments , and eventually determine in which cluster they end up ( see   3.3 below ) .",
    "as we argue in paper  i , our treatment of mergers and tidal disruption would be too simplistic to describe individual events , but can be used to describe the net , collective effect of tens of thousands of galactic encounters .",

    ", we can calculate the contribution of satellite galaxies in each luminosity bin , and include it in the luminosity function .",
    "the result is shown by the solid histogram in the top panel of figure  [ histo2 ] .",
    "there is now a good agreement with the schechter function at all luminosities @xmath114 , while there is still a mismatch at lower luminosities .",
    "we attribute this to the discreteness of the algorithm , in which all galaxy masses are multiples of @xmath48 . in particular ,",
    "the three lowest luminosity bins in figure  [ histo2 ] contain , respectively , galaxies of mass @xmath48 , of mass @xmath115 , and of masses @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "we can understand the large excess in the lowest luminosity bin by noting that galaxies of mass @xmath48 are allowed to form directly , while more massive galaxies must be built - up through a series of mergers .",
    "we find this agreement quite remarkable .",
    "there is nothing in our galaxy formation algorithm that guaranties a priori that the final luminosity function would even resemble a schechter function .",
    "the model was never tuned to obtain this result , and there is not much that _ could _ be tuned .",

    ", the exact value for a spherical collapse in a @xmath119 universe . ] the geometric factor @xmath81 entering into the merger criterion is a free parameter , but its value is close to unity for any reasonable density profile .",
    "we argue that the features seen in the simulated luminosity function at low luminosities are caused by the discreteness of the galaxy masses . hence , using a different value of @xmath48 would most likely move these features to different luminosities without affecting the high - end of the luminosity function .",
    "the only real free parameter in our model is the galaxy formation rate @xmath51 .",
    "changing that parameter might improve the fit at low luminosities , at the cost of worsening it at high luminosities .",
    "overall , we find that our model provides a satisfactory fit to the schechter luminosity function .",
    "in particular , it correctly predicts the value of the luminosity break @xmath120 , though that value ( or the corresponding mass @xmath121 ) is not built - in in the model .",
    "since the @xmath95 vs @xmath122 relation is non - linear , when two galaxies merge , the merger remnant does not have the total luminosity of the two progenitors .",
    "this simply reflects the fact that galactic evolution is much more than just a series of mergers .",
    "the luminosity of galaxies is affected by processes such as star formation and evolution , accretion , galactic winds , agn activity , and so on .",
    "since these processes are not included in our model , we can not predict the evolution of the luminosities of galaxies during and between mergers .",
    "this is why we calculate the values of the luminosity using the observed @xmath95 vs. @xmath122 relation .",

    "the number of all types of events increase roughly exponentially with redshift .",
    "the delay between the start of merger events ( @xmath127 ) and tidal destruction events ( @xmath128 ) reflects the time it takes to build galaxies of different masses , an essential condition for tidal destruction . at redshifts @xmath129 ,",

    "there is a remarkable separation between the three processes .",
    "direct mergers occur at low mass ratios , @xmath141 , dispersion occurs mostly at intermediate ratios , @xmath142 , and accretion occurs mostly at high mass ratio , @xmath143 . to explain these results ,",
    "let us consider what happens , in the simulation , during an encounter between a galaxy of mass @xmath133 and size @xmath144 and a galaxy of mass @xmath145 and size @xmath146 , separated by a distance @xmath147 .",
    "the tidal disruption and merger criteria used in our model will determine the outcome of this encounter .",
    "the gravitational field that binds the first galaxy is of order @xmath148 , while the tidal field of the second galaxy at the location of the first one is of order @xmath149 .",
    "the ratio of these fields , @xmath150 is then proportional to @xmath151 . since @xmath152 , it takes a certain mass ratio for tidal destruction to occur .",
    "hence , encounters between galaxies of comparable masses can only result in either mergers ( solid circles in fig .",
    "[ encounters_himass ] ) or nothing .",
    "but if the mass ratio is sufficiently large for the tidal disruption criterion to be satisfied , the lower - mass galaxy will be destroyed , and the merger criterion will determine whether the fragments are dispersed , or accreted by the higher - mass galaxy . unlike the tidal disruption criterion , the merger criterion depends on the velocity of the galaxies [ @xmath153-terms in eq .",

    "high - mass galaxies tend to be located in massive clusters .",
    "their velocities are usually not determined by their properties and the ones of their immediate neighbors , but rather by the overall properties of the cluster in which these galaxies are located .",

    "cluster c11 has two bright galaxies located on opposite sides of the center , which explains the low luminosity of the central bin .",
    "the profiles show large variations due to the clumpiness of the projected luminosity distributions , but there are some clear trends . for the massive clusters c02 and c05 , if we exclude the central bin , the histograms tend to be flat for the galactic luminosity and decreasing for the intracluster luminosity , indicating that the latter is more centrally concentrated .",
    "this is even clearer for the lower - mass clusters c11 , c13 , c15 , and c17 . both the galactic luminosity and intracluster luminosity decrease with radius , but the length scale of the intracluster light is of order @xmath200 of the length scale of the galactic light . as we saw in figure  [ destruct_histo ] , the destruction of intermediate - mass galaxies is the primary contributor to the intracluster light .",
    "these galaxies can only be destroyed by more massive ones , and these these massive galaxies tend to reside in the center of clusters .",
    "notice that , in our algorithm , tidal fragments are treated as single particles . when a galaxy is tidally destroyed , the algorithm flags it as a tidal fragment with the same mass .",
    "intermediate - mass tidal fragments might be subject to mass segregation , which in this case would be a spurious algorithmic effect , leading to an overestimate of the concentration of icl in the central region . still ,",
    "if most tidal fragments are produced by interactions taking place in the center of clusters , we do expect the fragments to be found in these regions at later time , whether they are represented by one massive particles or several less massive ones .",
    "our model combines a gravitational n - body algorithm , a subgrid treatment of galaxy formation , galaxy mergers , and tidal destruction , and a fitting formula for @xmath106 vs. @xmath95 derived from observations .",
    "the greatest virtue of this model is its simplicity . by only including gravitational dynamics , and by using a subgrid treatment at small mass scales ,",
    "we are able to perform a large cosmological simulation at relatively low computational cost .",
    "we simulate a cubic volume of @xmath23 in size , containing 18 clusters of mass above @xmath201 .",
    "doing a full hydrodynamical simulation of this size , without subgrid physics , that could resolve in detail galactic mergers and tidal destruction at the dwarf galaxy scale would be prohibitive .",
    "our simulation only took a few weeks on a 16-processor computer .",
    "there are some caveats implied by the method we use . by only including gravity , and not hydrodynamics",
    ", our algorithm can describe the structure and evolution of the mass distribution in the universe , but not how this mass is converted to light .",
    "hence , the algorithm can not predict the luminosity of galaxies self - consistently .",
    "this is why we used the observed relation between @xmath106 and @xmath95 [ eq .",
    "( [ ml1 ] ) ] to calculate the luminosity of galaxies and tidal fragments .",
    "actually , this relation gives the _ average _ value of @xmath106 .",
    "for any particular value of @xmath95 , there is a distribution of values of @xmath106 @xcite .",
    "we ignored this , and calculated the luminosity @xmath122 of an object of mass @xmath95 by using equation  ( [ ml1 ] ) directly .",
    "we could instead have used the actual distribution of values of @xmath106 and draw a random value from that distribution for each object , but that would have been an overkill .",
    "we formed @xmath202 dwarf galaxies in our simulation , and by @xmath5 , each massive cluster ( @xmath203 ) contains between 311 and @xmath204 galaxies , and between 91 and @xmath205 tidal fragments .",
    "drawing the ratios @xmath106 from a distribution instead of using the average value would hardly make any difference in the total luminosity of these components , and the inferred intracluster light fraction @xmath3 .",
    "using a subgrid model for galaxy mergers and tidal destruction enables us to reach dwarf - galaxy scales while simulating a large cosmological volume , but there is also another advantage : it provides an unambiguous determination of the outcome of each close encounter ( merger , tidal destruction , or simple encounter ) .",
    "if the encounters were actually simulated in details , the determination of their outcome would require detailed analysis , as some of the matter would merge , while some would be ejected , and some of that ejected matter would be reaccreted .",
    "as we argue here , and also in paper  i , our subgrid model would not be appropriate to describe a single encounter , but can correctly describe , in a statistical way , the collective effect of a large number of encounters . in the simulation presented in this paper , @xmath206 encounters resulted in a merger , @xmath207 encounters resulted in tidal destruction",
    "followed be dispersion , and @xmath208 encounters resulted in tidal destruction followed by accretion .",
    "we have assumed that the intracluster light is caused entirely by galaxies that are tidally destroyed .",
    "some simulations suggest that luminous matter can also be added to the intracluster space during mergers ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "since we are neglecting this effect , our values of @xmath3 might be underestimated .",
    "however , we could argue that a merger with some of the matter being dispersed in the icl , a case we do not consider , is an intermediate case between a tidal destruction with complete dispersal of the fragments and a tidal destruction with all the fragments being subsequently reaccreted , two cases we do consider .",
    "hence , two mergers with some of the matter dispersed in the intracluster space could be equivalent to a tidal destruction with complete dispersal of the fragments plus a tidal destruction with complete reaccretion of the the fragments .",
    "statistically , the net effect might be the same .",
    "our model has only one parameter that is truly tunable : the coefficient @xmath51 appearing in equation  ( [ gf ] ) .",
    "we adjusted this value to reproduce the high - luminosity end of the luminosity function , as seen in figure  [ histo2 ] .",
    "using a larger value of @xmath51 might lead to an improvement of the luminosity function at the low - luminosity end , but could worsen the fit at the high - luminosity end .",
    "also , a larger value of @xmath51 would likely result in an increase in both @xmath169 and @xmath170 , while having a smaller effect on the value of @xmath3 .",
    "we performed a numerical simulation of the formation of galaxies and clusters , the destruction of galaxies by mergers and tides , and the evolution of the galactic , extragalactic , and intracluster light , inside a cosmological volume of size @xmath209 , in a @xmath2cdm universe .",
    "our main results are the following :    * our simulation reproduces the observed schechter luminosity function for luminosities @xmath114 , up to @xmath210 .",
    "we have a significant excess of galaxies at luminosities @xmath211 , and a deficit in the range @xmath212 .",
    "we attribute this to the discreteness of the galaxy masses .",
    "all galaxies in our simulation have masses that are multiples of @xmath40 , and this can affect the luminosity function at low @xmath122 . * the number of mergers and tidal destruction events increase exponentially with decreasing redshift , with mergers starting at @xmath213 and tidal destruction starting at @xmath214 .",
    "this delay is caused by the time it takes to build up galaxies of significantly different masses .",
    "mergers outnumber tidal destruction events by about an order of magnitude , at all redshifts up to the present .",
    "when tidal destruction occurs , dispersal of the fragments into the intracluster space dominates over reaccretion of the fragments by the larger galaxy , up to redshift @xmath215 .",
    "this trend is then reversed . * tidal destruction is not limited to dwarf galaxies .",
    "intermediate - mass galaxies and even high - mass galaxies are destroyed during encounters with even higher - mass galaxies .",
    "tidal destruction and also mergers involve galaxy pairs with all masses and all mass ratios .",
    "we found an interesting trend for encounters between high - mass galaxies ( @xmath216 , @xmath139 ) .",
    "the outcome of such encounter seems to depend almost entirely on the mass ratio between the galaxies . small mass ratios ( @xmath141 ) result in mergers , intermediate mass ratios ( @xmath217 )",
    "result in tidal destruction with the fragment being dispersed into the intracluster space , and higher mass ratios result in tidal destruction , with the fragments being reaccreted by the massive galaxy . *",
    "most galaxies destroyed by tides are low - mass galaxies . however , the total luminosity provided by these low - mass galaxies is small .",
    "57.9% of the icl comes from galaxies of intermediate masses ( @xmath218 , @xmath219 ) , while lower - mass galaxies provide only 11.5% of the icl .",
    "essentially , the bulk of the icl comes from galaxies of masses @xmath220 which are tidally destroyed by galaxies of mass @xmath221 .",
    "higher mass ratios result in reaccretion of the tidal fragments . *",
    "the present intracluster light fraction @xmath3 is in the range @xmath222 .",
    "this is consistent with observations , and with simulations presented by other groups .",
    "even though mergers outnumber tidal destruction events by an order of magnitude , the latter are sufficient to explain the observed icl .",
    "the galaxy luminosity @xmath169 and intracluster luminosity @xmath170 both increase with cluster mass .",
    "the intracluster light fraction @xmath3 does not show any particular trend with cluster mass , except for the fact that we did not find massive clusters with low values of @xmath3 . *",
    "the value of @xmath3 for any particular cluster tends to increase with time .",
    "however , some clusters experience sudden drops in @xmath3 , that can happen at any redshift . at early times , these sudden drops are caused by major mergers , when the cluster absorbs another cluster of comparable mass but with a smaller value of @xmath3 . at late times , they are caused by a sudden increase in galaxy formation not accompanied by a corresponding increase in tidal destruction .",
    "* several clusters are not relaxed at @xmath5 , and show complex structures with multiple cores .",
    "focusing on the clusters with a well - defined core , we found that the distribution of icl is more concentrated than the distribution of galactic light .",

    "<S> this algorithm simulates the growth of large - scale structures and the formation of clusters , the evolution of the galaxy population in clusters , the destruction of galaxies by mergers and tides , and the evolution of the intracluster light . </S>",
    "<S> we find that destruction of galaxies by mergers dominates over destruction by tides by about an order of magnitude at all redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> however , tidal destruction is sufficient to produce intracluster light fractions @xmath3 that are sufficiently high to match observations . </S>",
    "<S> our simulation produces 18 massive clusters ( @xmath4 ) with values of @xmath3 ranging from 1% to 58% at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> there is a weak trend of @xmath3 to increase with cluster mass . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of the intracluster light ( @xmath6 ) is provided by intermediate galaxies of total masses @xmath7 and stellar masses @xmath8 that were tidally destroyed by even more massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution of low - mass galaxies to the intracluster light is small and the contribution of dwarf galaxies is negligible , even though , by numbers , most galaxies that are tidally destroyed are dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> tracking clusters back in time , we find that their values of @xmath3 tend to increase over time , but can experience sudden changes that are sometimes non - monotonic . </S>",
    "<S> these changes occur during major mergers involving clusters of comparable masses but very different intracluster luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> most of the tidal destruction events take place in the central regions of clusters . as a result , the intracluster light is more centrally concentrated than the galactic light . </S>",
    "<S> our results support tidal destruction of intermediate - mass galaxies as a plausible scenario for the origin of the intracluster light . </S>"
