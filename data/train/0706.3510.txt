    "the quantum tunneling through a potential barrier is one of paradigms of quantum self - interference , which involves interpretation and application of quantum mechanics .",
    "however , there remains the old question of how long a quantum particle takes to tunnel through a potential barrier higher than its kinetic energy . in his 1932 paper [ 1 ]",
    "l. a. maccoll concluded:@xmath0it is found that the transmitted packet appears at point @xmath1 at about the time at which the incident packet reaches the point @xmath2 , so that there is no appreciable delay in the transmission of the packet through the barrier.@xmath3 after three decades , t. e. hartman stated : @xmath0for thicker barriers the peak of the transmitted packet is shifted , relative to the incident packet , to higher energy values .",
    "the transmission time becomes independent of barrier thickness and small compared to the @xmath0equal time@xmath3.@xmath3[2 ] these statements imply unbounded tunneling velocities since the thickness may be infinite .",
    "hitherto there exist various definitions of the tunneling time in literature [ 3 - 5 ] . among those ,",
    "wigner s phase time [ 6 ] and smith s dwell time [ 7 ] are paid more attention due to their results showing superluminality .    like young s interference",
    ", quantum tunneling is a kind of self - interference behavior .",
    "the origin of the behavior is discussed in detail in ref.[8 ] .",
    "briefly , a free quantum particle can be described in terms of a non - spreading wave packet consisting of fourier components in which there is one component , called characteristic component exclusively related to energy @xmath4 and momentum @xmath5 of the particle , that is exactly an ordinary wave function .",
    "the frequencies @xmath6 and wave vectors @xmath7 of the other components as hidden waves have nothing to do with the planck constant , so that the wave packet of this kind never spreads .",
    "this non - spreading wave packet on a lower level is a kind of primary wave packet completely different from the de broglie wave packet as secondary wave packet consisting of components related to different energies and different momenta .",
    "the part outside the peak of the primary wave packet plays a dramatic role in its self - interference . according to this realistic view for quantum behavior",
    ", we use a monochromatic plane wave to describe incompletely the incident particle with kinetic energy @xmath8 , propose a new solution to the tunneling time problem and present a high - jumping model of quantum tunneling to resolve the paradox that kinetic energy of the tunneling particle is negative and its momentum is imaginary in the classically forbidden potential barrier .",
    "we consider a non - relativistic electron with kinetic energy @xmath8 tunneling through a one - dimensional rectangular potential barrier of thickness _",
    "d _ and height @xmath9 higher than the incident kinetic energy .",
    "we calculate the momentum distribution of the electron , its root - mean - square ( rms ) velocity and effective tunneling time in the barrier region . according to quantum mechanics ,",
    "its energy eigenfunction can be split into three parts : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 in which @xmath13\\textrm{sinh}(\\kappa d)-2i(k/\\kappa)\\textrm{cosh}(\\kappa d)}\\ ] ] @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath16\\ ] ] the probability flux density of the incident electron is @xmath17    the momentum ( @xmath18 ) distribution of the electron in the barrier region can be calculated by using the following fourier  transform [ 9 ] : @xmath19 the normalized distribution probability is @xmath20 the root of mean square of _ k _ is @xmath21 in this work , we define @xmath22 as the tunneling velocity and define @xmath23 as the effective tunneling time .",

    "the present definition of the tunneling time is completely different from the existing typical definitions , such as phase time [ 6,10 ] , dwell time [ 7,10 ] and btticker - landauer time [ 11 ] . according to the phase time definition , the tunneling time is supposed to be : @xmath33",
