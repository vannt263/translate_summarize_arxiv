    "large configuration interaction ( ci ) calculations of the helium ground state are performed here in order to more precisely elucidate the convergence properties of the ci expansion for this atom .",
    "the general properties of the ci expansion have been known since the seminal work of schwartz @xcite , which provided the underlying foundation for the later analytic and computational investigations @xcite .",
    "the ci expansion using single center orbitals is slowly convergent with respect to @xmath2 , the maximum angular momentum of any orbital included in the ci expansion . in particular , the leading term to the energy increment",
    "is expected to behave at high @xmath2 as : @xmath10    although there have been a number of very large ci calculations performed on helium , all of the earlier calculations using analytic basis sets treat the higher @xmath2 contributions to the energy with less precision than the low @xmath2 contributions . typically , the number of radial orbitals for the high @xmath0 are smaller than the number of low @xmath0 .",
    "the justification for this is that the high @xmath0 partial waves make a smaller contribution to the energy and other expectation values of than the low @xmath0 orbitals . at first sight",
    "this approach would seem reasonable for obtaining estimates of the total energy .",
    "however , this approach does lead to problems when studying the convergence properties of ci expansion itself . here",
    "it is necessary to ensure that the successive contributions to the energy are obtained with the same _ relative _ accuracy and this can hardly be guaranteed with a radial basis that decreases in size as @xmath0 increases .",
    "indeed , the evidence suggests that the dimension of the radial basis should be increased as @xmath2 increases if the relative accuracy of the energy is to be maintained @xcite .",
    "the convergence problems present in ci calculations of atomic and molecular structure are also present in a much severe manner in ci calculations of the positron - atom problem .",
    "the ci method has recently been applied to the study of positronic atoms ( electronically stable states consisting of a positron bound to an atom ) @xcite and also to positron - atom scattering states @xcite .",
    "the attractive electron - positron interaction leads to the formation of a ps cluster ( i.e. something akin to a positronium atom ) in the outer valence region of the atom @xcite .",
    "the accurate representation of a ps cluster using only single particle orbitals centered on the nucleus requires the inclusion of orbitals with much higher angular momenta than a roughly equivalent electron - only calculation @xcite . in the most extreme case",
    "so far considered , namely @xmath11li , a calculation with @xmath12 was required before the energy had decreased enough to establish binding .",
    "given that helium is described as slowly convergent @xcite , one struggles to find an adjective that could characterize the convergence properties of positronic systems !",
    "the two most important expectation values for positronic systems are the energy , and the rate for electron - positron annihilation .",
    "the annihilation rate , which is proportional to the expectation of the electron - positron @xmath1-function , has the inconvenient property that it is even more slowly convergent than the energy with respect to orbital angular momentum .",
    "one has successive increments decreasing at high @xmath2 according to @xcite : @xmath13 to put this in perspective , it would take a calculation with @xmath14 to recover 99@xmath6 of the psh annihilation rate @xcite .",
    "in addition to the slow convergence with @xmath2 , the @xmath1-function operator also exhibits very slow convergence with respect to the radial basis @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "large basis ci calculations of the he ground state are performed in order to more exactly understand the convergence of the ci expansion .",
    "since the properties of the he ground state are known to high precision it is a very useful laboratory system with which to test methods of extrapolating the radial and partial wave expansions to completion .",
    "the insights obtained from helium should then be applicable to positronic systems and also possibly give additional guidance about how to approach purely electronic systems . besides looking at the energy , the convergence of the ci expansion of the electron - electron @xmath1-function expectation value",
    "is also studied due to its relation with the electron - positron annihilation operator ( which is also a @xmath1-function ) .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath1-function operator also appears in the breit - pauli relativistic correction as the two - body darwin interaction @xcite .",
    "the present work builds on an earlier investigation that studied the convergence of the radial basis in a simplified model of the helium atom which only included @xmath15 orbitals @xcite .",
    "the ci wave function in a single - center basis is a linear combination of anti - symmetrised two - electron states with the usual clebsch - gordan coupling coefficients , @xmath16 the functions @xmath17 are single electron orbitals written as a product of a radial function and a spherical harmonic : @xmath18 all observable quantities can be defined symbolically as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the increment to the observable that occurs when the maximum orbital angular momentum is increased from @xmath21 to @xmath2 , e.g. @xmath22 hence , one can write formally @xmath23    the first term on the right hand side will be determined by explicit computation while the second term must be estimated .",
    "the problem confronting all single center calculations is that part of @xmath24 arises from terms with @xmath0-values that are not included in the largest explicit calculation .",
    "the two expectation values that were investigated were that of the energy @xmath25 and the electron - electron @xmath1-function , @xmath26 . for helium , terms with @xmath27",
    "contribute only 0.033@xmath6 of the total energy . for purely electronic systems",
    "these higher @xmath0 terms make a small ( but slowly convergent ) correction to the total energy and other expectation values .",
    "the extrapolation schemes used later in this paper have their basis in the work of schwartz @xcite , hill @xcite and kutzelnigg and associates @xcite .",
    "analytic work indicates that the energy increments are given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 given a two - body wave function @xmath30 .",
    "no expressions for @xmath31 have been presented . at large @xmath2",
    ", one expects the energy increments to be well described by eq .",
    "( [ pe1 ] ) .",
    "for the @xmath1-function one can write @xmath32 where @xmath33 is believed @xcite to be @xmath34 ( ottschofski and kutzelnigg give a formula similar to this for the leading relativistic contribution to the energy of two - electron atoms .",
    "we have assumed the slow @xmath35 convergence is due to the two - electron darwin term ) .",
    "it should be noted that gribakin and ludlow @xcite have also derived an expression equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ ad ] ) in the context of positron annihilation .",
    "the numerical value was taken from a variational wave function of the he ground state with a basis of 250 explicitly correlated gaussians and an energy of -2.9037243752 hartree .",
