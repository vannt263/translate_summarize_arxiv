    "the reliability of the experimental data depends both on our ability to imprint circulation states deterministically and to eliminate spontaneous circulation states .",

    "the confidence level of imprinting a circulation state with one unit of circulation before the measurement stage is 0.96(2 ) .    to measure the decay constant , we again apply a stationary perturbation whose strength is variable , but always less than the chemical potential .",

    "we initialize the atoms in the ring in either a circulation state of @xmath6 or @xmath9 .",

    "we then do an exponential forced evaporation ramp by lowering the laser power to obtain a degenerate quantum gas .",
    "the temperature of this gas is set by the final depth of the optical dipole trap .",
    "we reach a temperature of 85(20 )  nk and 195(30 )  nk for powers of 140  mw and 350  mw of red - detuned ir light respectively . a separate tem@xmath12 red - detuned crossed dipole trap",

    "the atoms now reside in a potential which is the convolution of an attractive potential of the red - detuned sheet trap and a repulsive blue - detuned target trap . the trap depth and hence the temperature",
    "is set by the red - detuned trap , since the potential due to red - detuned tem@xmath12 beams are typically deeper than their blue - detuned counterparts  @xcite .",
    "to extract the temperature , we release the atoms in the target trap in time of flight and then image the cloud in the horizontal direction .",

    "the atoms are then adiabatically transferred from the red - detuned vertical trap to the blue - detuned vertical trap ( while horizontal confinement is maintained by the crossed dipole trap ) .",
    "we then perform a forced evaporation ramp by lowering the trapping power of the crossed dipole trap .",
    "finally , the atoms are transferred to the target potential and the crossed dipole beam is turned off .",
    "we let the condensate equilibriate for 1  s. the temperature in the blue - detuned trap is set by both the depth of the target trap potential and the power of the blue - detuned vertical trap .",
    "the method used to extract temperature from the red - detuned trap does not work with the blue - detuned trap due to the lower temperature . to circumvent this problem",
    ", we blow away the atoms in the ring and let the atoms in the disc expand in time of flight , imaging vertically .",
    "this is done for two primary reasons .",
    "first , the central disc is hard - walled and we expect the atoms in the disc to have a lower critical temperature  . a lower critical temperature results in a higher fraction of thermal atoms , making it easier to extract a temperature .",
    "second , an analytical expression for an expanding toroidal trap does not exist  . to make our measurements more accurate , we not only took data in the experimental configuration ( with a target trap power of 14.6  mw ) , but also at higher powers using the same atom number and vertical trapping frequency of the blue - detuned trap .",
