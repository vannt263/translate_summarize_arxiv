    "diffuse intergalactic hydrogen produces numerous weak redshifted ly@xmath2  ( 1216 ) absorption features along lines of sight to distant bright objects such as quasars , the phenomenon known as the ly@xmath2  forest  @xcite .",
    "advances in sensitive high - resolution spectroscopy and theoretical understanding of structure formation have led to the currently favoured paradigm for the origin of the ly@xmath2  forest  @xcite : it arises from highly photoionized intergalactic hydrogen  @xcite tracing uncollapsed large - scale structure in the cosmic web .",
    "the general properties of the ly@xmath2  forest are well - described by the fluctuating gunn - peterson approximation  ( fgpa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which a tight relation between density and temperature in cosmologically - expanding photoionized gas  @xcite leads to a tight correlation between the ly@xmath2  optical depth and the underlying mass density at each location along the line of sight . at @xmath7 , where the ly@xmath2transition falls into the observed - frame optical ,",
    "this approximation is quite good , and it can be used to infer the mean baryon density @xcite and the matter fluctuation spectrum , which in turn provides constraints on cosmological parameters @xcite .    in this paper , a successor to @xcite and @xcite , we use cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to model the igm and the ly@xmath2  forest at lower redshifts . here",
    "the ly@xmath2  transition falls in the ultraviolet ( uv ) , requiring more difficult space - based observations .",
    "furthermore , the physical description of the ly@xmath2  forest departs more strongly from the fgpa , because filamentary structures begin to grow so large as to heat a significant fraction of intergalactic gas to well above photoionization temperatures @xcite .",
    "this results in the emergence of the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ; @xcite ) , which contains a substantial fraction of all baryons today .",
    "additionally , the evolving relationship between matter overdensity and ly@xmath2  column density is such that at low-@xmath8 , a given overdensity produces a lower column density absorber : roughly speaking , a @xmath9 line at @xmath10 is physically analogous to a @xmath11 line at @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this shift results in many fewer ly@xmath2  forest absorbers to a given sensitivity limit , i.e. a much thinner forest of lines .",
    "all these factors make the low-@xmath8 ly@xmath2  forest more difficult to characterize both observationally and theoretically , and not as useful for constraining cosmology  @xcite .",
    "but the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at low-@xmath8 still contains the vast majority of baryons in the universe , so understanding the low-@xmath8 ly@xmath2  forest and the whim remains a central challenge to assembling a complete picture of cosmic baryon evolution .",
    "one of the original key projects of _ hubble space telescope _ was to understand the low-@xmath8 ly@xmath2  forest .",
    "the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) , despite being unable to fully resolve ly@xmath2  absorbers , provided critical insights into the nature of the low-@xmath8 ly@xmath2  forest .",
    "for example , even the earliest observations showed that the number density evolution of ly@xmath2  absorbers must slow dramatically between @xmath13 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "initially , it was suggested that low-@xmath8 absorbers might represent a different population than those at high-@xmath8 , with the high-@xmath8 systems tracing the cosmic web and the low-@xmath8 systems arising in galaxy halos  @xcite .",
    "this idea was supported by the apparently tight connection between column density and galaxy impact parameter  @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that all these observations can be fully accomodated within the structure formation model of the ly@xmath2  forest .",
    "the change in number density evolution can be explained as an ionization effect  @xcite , since the dominant source of metagalactic flux ( quasars ) diminishes rapidly at @xmath14  @xcite , countering the effect of the declining mean density of baryons .",
    "the relationship between ly@xmath2  equivalent width and galaxy impact parameter arises because the igm is denser around galaxies owing to matter clustering .",
    "subsequent higher - resolution quasar spectroscopy using the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) has generally confirmed these interpretations , and stis ly@xmath2  forest data is well - described by structure formation models  @xcite .",
    "hence the low-@xmath8 ly@xmath2  forest is not fundamentally different than the high-@xmath8 one , although the relationship of neutral hydrogen absorption to large - scale structure has shifted .    the installation of the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on _ hubble _ should usher in a new age for the study of the low-@xmath8 ly@xmath2  forest .",
    "the dramatically increased sensitivity over stis will enable a more robust characterization of the @xmath15 igm , and it will enable study of ly@xmath2  absorbers at overdensities comparable to that detectable at high-@xmath8 .",
    "cos will also enable tomographic probes of the igm at transverse separations that will provide interesting constraints on the large - scale coherence of ly@xmath2absorbers  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "all these data will provide theoretical studies with new opportunities to understand the low-@xmath8 igm , and new challenges for models to meet .",
    "an advantage of low-@xmath8 igm work compared to high-@xmath8 is that the galaxy population around low-@xmath8 absorbers can be studied to much greater depth .",
    "the relation between the two provides unique insights into how the early and late stages of gravitational collapse are connected , and how the baryons have decoupled from the dark matter via shock heating and radiative cooling .",
    "the galaxy - absorber connection can be studied through the individual association of galaxies with absorbers or by statistical measures such as correlation functions .",
    "this is the subject of a subsequent paper in this series ( kollmeier et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "another paper in this series ( oppenheimer et al .",
    ", in preparation ) will deal with metal line absorbers detectable using cos , and their relationship to galaxies and large - scale structure .    in this paper",
    ", we employ state - of - the - art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to study the @xmath15 igm as traced by the ly@xmath2  forest and whim .",
    "where appropriate we include comparisons with existing data and predictions for cos .",
    "our new simulations have @xmath16 more particles and @xmath17 more volume compared to our previous studies in @xcite and @xcite , and they include more sophisticated physical processes compared to those works and more recent studies such as @xcite . for example , our simulations now include metal - line cooling and a well - constrained heuristic model for galactic winds that enrich the igm and regulate star formation in accord with observations . while we will not discuss chemical enrichment in this work  ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the energy input from such outflows can non - trivially impact the thermal conditions in the igm , particularly around galaxies .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to simulate pressure forces and shocks on the gas particles .",
    "we include radiative cooling from primordial gas assuming ionization equilibrium  ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and metal - line cooling based on @xcite .",
    "star formation follows a @xcite law calibrated to the kennicutt ( 1998ab ) relation ; particles above a density threshold where sub - particle jeans fragmentation can occur are randomly selected to spawn a star with half their original gas mass . the interstellar medium ( ism )",
    "is modeled through an analytic subgrid recipe following @xcite , including energy returned from supernovae  @xcite .",
    "kinetic outflows are also included emanating from all galaxies that are forming stars .",
    "gas particles eligible for star formation are randomly selected to be in an outflow .",
    "outflowing particle have their velocity augmented by @xmath18 in a direction given by * v*@xmath19*a * , where * v * and * a * are the comoving velocity and acceleration of the particle , respectively . the ratio of the probabilities to be in an outflow relative to that for forming into stars is given by @xmath20 , the mass loading factor .",
    "hydrodynamic forces on wind particles are  turned off \" until the particle reaches one - tenth the threshold density for star formation , or a maximum time of 20  kpc/@xmath18 .",
    "this hydrodynamic delay allows wind particles to escape their host galactic disks , mimicking the effect of `` chimneys '' in the interstellar medium that are unresolvable in cosmological simulations but would allow the escape of gas in real galaxies .",
    "the choices for @xmath18 and @xmath20 , including their possible dependence on galaxy or halo properties , define the  wind model \" .",
    "we consider three wind models .",
    "the first has no winds ,",
    "this model fails a number of observational tests , including overproducing cosmic star formation  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and failing to enrich the igm  @xcite , but it serves as a baseline model to assess the impact of outflows on the diffuse igm .    the second wind model uses constant values of @xmath21 and @xmath22 for all outflows from every galaxy ; we call this our  constant wind \" ( cw ) model .",
    "the cw model is similar to that used in @xcite , @xcite ( though their wind speed is somewhat lower ) , and the overwhelmingly large simulations  ( owls ; * ? ? ?",
    "this model uses all the supernova energy ( assuming a chabrier imf ) to drive kinetic winds .",
    "doing so suppresses cosmic star formation to be broadly in agreement with observations , with the added benefit of yielding resolution - converged results  @xcite . in detail , it fails to enrich the igm in agreement with high-@xmath8 absorbers  @xcite or to enrich galaxies in accord with observations of the mass - metallicity relation  @xcite , but it is still a physically reasonable scenario that captures some of the main effects implied by the observations .    our preferred model , which we refer to as  vzw \" , uses scalings expected for momentum - driven winds  @xcite , though we note that such scalings can be generated by other physical mechanisms  @xcite . here , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy .",
    "we estimate @xmath25 from the galaxy s stellar mass following @xcite , using an on - the - fly friends - of - friends galaxy finder , as described in @xcite .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath26 is randomly chosen for each ejection event in the range @xmath27 , based on observations of local starbursts by @xcite .",
    "this choice also gives outflow velocities consistent with that seen in @xmath28  @xcite and @xmath29  @xcite star - forming galaxies .",
    "the ejection speeds are generally comparable to the galaxy escape velocities at low redshifts , but because wind particles are slowed by hydrodynamic interactions with surrounding gas , they typically do not escape their host galactic halos , at least in more massive systems .",
    "@xmath30 is a free parameter adjusted to broadly match the cosmic star formation history ; here we choose @xmath31 .",
    "this yields @xmath32 for @xmath33 galaxies at @xmath34 , which is in agreement with the constraints inferred from @xmath34 galaxies by @xcite .",
    "the key features of our momentum - driven wind model are the higher mass - loading factors and lower ejection velocities in lower mass galaxies .",
    "this model has displayed repeated and often unique success at matching a range of cosmic star formation and enrichment data .",
    "this includes observations of igm enrichment as seen in @xmath35 absorbers  @xcite , @xmath36 absorbers  @xcite , and @xmath37 metal - line absorbers  @xcite .",
    "concurrently , it also matches the galaxy mass - metallicity relation  @xcite , and the enrichment levels seen in @xmath12 intragroup gas  @xcite .",
    "it also suppresses star formation in agreement with high - redshift luminosity functions  @xcite and the cosmic evolution of uv luminosity at @xmath38  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the nw and cw models , the vzw model approximately reproduces the observed @xmath12 stellar mass function of galaxies up to luminosities @xmath33 , though it still predicts excessive stellar masses for higher mass galaxies @xcite . the numerical implementation of this model  with probabilistic , one - at - a - time particle ejection and the temporary turn - off of hydrodynamic forces  is only a heuristic representation of the underlying physics , and there are significant numerical and physical uncertainties associated with the hydrodynamic interactions between wind and ambient - halo particles and the mixing of outflows with the surrounding gas .",
    "nonetheless , this heuristic model appears to distribute matter and energy into the igm and regulate galaxy growth in broad accord with observations .",
    "while we leave a detailed discussion of metals to a forthcoming paper in this series , the simulations include a sophisticated chemical evolution model that follows four individual species ( c , o , si , fe ) from three sources : type ii sne , type ia sne , and stellar mass loss from agb stars .",
    "the former instantaneously enriches star - forming particles , whose metallicity can then be carried into the igm via outflows ( described below ) .",
    "type  ia modeling is based on the fit to data by @xcite , with a prompt component tracing the star formation rate and a delayed component ( with a 0.7  gyr delay ) tracking stellar mass .",
    "stellar mass loss is derived from @xcite population synthesis modeling assuming a @xcite imf .",
    "delayed feedback adds energy and metals to the three nearest gas particles ; type  ia s add @xmath39  ergs per sn , while agb stars add no energy , only metals .",
    "we use @xcite yields for type  ii sne ; yields for type  ia and agb stars come from various works  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) .",
    "the primary simulations used here are those described by @xcite , using the three outflow models outlined above .",
    "each simulation contains @xmath40 gas and @xmath40 dark matter particles , in a random periodic volume of @xmath41 ( comoving ) on a side with a gravitational softening length ( i.e. spatial resolution ) of @xmath42 ( comoving , plummer equivalent ) .",
    "we assume a cosmology concordant with wmap-7 constraints @xcite , specifically @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "this yields gas and dark matter particle masses of @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the initial conditions are generated with an @xcite power spectrum at @xmath51 , in the linear regime , and evolved to @xmath12 ; they are identical for all simulations .",
    "our naming convention is r[boxsize]n[number of particles per side][wind model ] , where the initial letter `` r '' indicates the particular choice of cosmology above .",
    "hence our models are r48n384nw , r48n384cw , and r48n384vzw15 , where the postscript 15 on vzw indicates our choice of @xmath31 .",
    "to investigate the effects of the numerical resolution and box size , we also employ a simulation with @xmath52 gas and @xmath52 dark matter particles , in a random periodic volume of @xmath53 ( comoving ) on a side with a gravitational softening length of @xmath54 ( r96n512vzw15 ) .",
    "this simulation is run with the same momentum - driven wind model as our @xmath55 case , and we will refer to it as  vzw-96 \" .",
    "compared to vzw-48 , it has an eight times larger simulation volume but 3.375 times worse mass resolution .",
    "hence it tests both sensitivity to box size and numerical resolution , although the dynamic range in either sense is not dramatically large .",
    "spectra are generated using our spectral generation code specexbin , which casts lines of sight at an angle to the simulation axes , allowing continuous and non - repeating lines of sight to be generated through the periodic simulation volumes .",
    "we generate 70 such continuous spectra from @xmath56 to @xmath12 .",
    "specexbin calculates optical depths in and a variety of metal ions ; here we will only be concerned with ly@xmath2 . for line statistics we will typically consider three redshift ranges , namely @xmath57 ( which we will call  @xmath12 \" ) , @xmath58 (  @xmath59 \" ) and @xmath60 (  @xmath56 \" )",
    ". in each interval ,",
    "the total path length for the 70 spectra is @xmath61 .",
    "this is comparable to the path length to be obtained by , e.g. , the program of the cos gto team .",
    "the procedure for calculating optical depths is described by @xcite . in brief , the algorithm is to ( i ) calculate the neutral fraction of each gas particle based on the density , temperature , and the assumed photoionizing flux ( discussed below ) ; ( ii ) smooth the neutral hydrogen density onto randomly - chosen lines of sight in real space ; ( iii ) calculate optical depths assuming ionization equilibrium and optically - thin gas using cloudy96  @xcite ; and ( iv ) use the -weighted peculiar velocity as well as hubble flow to rebin the real space optical depths into redshift space .",
    "this produces a table of optical depths versus redshift along each line of sight .",
    "concurrently , for each ionic absorption species specexbin outputs the optical depth - weighted temperature , density , and metallicity , which are used to quantify the physical conditions in each identified absorber . for lines of sight that parallel box axes , specexbin produces the same ly@xmath2  absorption spectra as tipsy @xcite . as reported by @xcite ,",
    "the ly@xmath2  flux power spectra computed from tipsy spectra at @xmath62 are indistinguishable from those produced by the independent spectral extraction code of @xcite , confirming the robustness of the procedure to the details of numerical implementation .",
    "extracted spectra are converted from optical depths to fluxes , resampled to a pixel scale of @xmath63 , and convolved with the cos line spread function ( lsf ) .",
    "specifically , we use the fuv g130 m lsf at 1450 .",
    "the lsf varies only very slightly with wavelength in the fuv channel , but is substantially different ( and narrower ) in the nuv channel .",
    "nevertheless , we keep the lsf fixed at all wavelengths so as to avoid introducing any artificial evolution from the varying lsf . generally , the fuv lsf is somewhat broader than had been originally expected , with its central peak having an equivalent @xmath64 gaussian width of @xmath65 , and it also has substantial non - gaussian wings . finally , we add gaussian random noise to the simulated spectra assuming a signal to noise ratio of s / n=30 per pixel .",
    "this is comparable to the highest quality data that will be obtained with cos .",
    "-0.4 in    -0.2 in    the shape and amplitude of the metagalactic photoionizing flux are still not well constrained , particularly at lower redshifts .",
    "we assume that the flux is spatially - uniform , which is probably a good approximation in the diffuse and optically thin ly@xmath2  forest .",
    "we take the spectral shape from that predicted by @xcite using the population of observed quasars and star - forming galaxies ( their  q1g01 \" model ) .",
    "this model assumes a 10% escape fraction of ionizing radiation from galaxies and is broadly consistent with available constraints  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "-2.2 in    -0.3 in    we adjust the amplitude of the metagalactic flux to match the observed evolution of the mean flux decrement ( @xmath66 ) in the ly@xmath2  forest .",
    "a modest post - processing adjustment recovers essentially the identical answer to running the entire simulation with a different ionizing background , since the dynamics of ly@xmath2  forest gas are negligibly affected by photoionization  @xcite .",
    "the amount of adjustment varies slightly among our simulations , since the outflows have a small but non - negligible impact on the ly@xmath2  forest . in practice",
    ", we multiply all the optical depths by a factor @xmath67 before we convert to flux , then measure @xmath66 , and iteratively adjust @xmath67 until we obtain a good match to @xmath68 . in the optically - thin approximation ( excellent in this case ) , this procedure is equivalent to multiplying the strength of the ionizing background by @xmath69 . while in principle we could have @xmath67 be a function of redshift , this was not seen to be necessary to within the accuracy of available data , and so we simply determine a constant @xmath67 individually for each simulation .",
    "the resulting evolution of the mean flux decrement in the ly@xmath2forest is shown in the top panel of figure  [ fig : meanflux ] .",
    "the values of @xmath67 are indicated in the parentheses within the legend ; they are close to unity , indicating that the original @xcite metagalactic flux amplitude is viable to within current observational uncertainties . in all cases ,",
    "the resulting @xmath68 is a reasonable match to observations by @xcite , who measured the flux decrement evolution using data compiled from _",
    "s faint object spectrograph ( fos ) at @xmath70 and the keck telescope s high resolution echelle spectrograph ( hires ) at @xmath71 .",
    "the simulations appear to have a somewhat higher flux decrement at @xmath72 , but in this regime the low resolution of fos and the increased blending owing to a thicker ly@xmath2  forest ( as compared to @xmath36 ) are more likely to result in continuum placement errors that would cause the flux decrement to be biased low .",
    "hence we do not consider these discrepancies serious as yet , though they are worth revisiting when better data becomes available from cos .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ fig : meanflux ] shows the evolution of the photoionization rate @xmath73 that yields the mean flux evolution in the top panel .",
    "since we multiply the @xcite model by a constant factor , the shapes of the curves are identical to their model .",
    "the amplitude is multiplied by @xmath74 , so vzw is slightly higher than nw ; cw is identical to nw since it has the same @xmath67 .",
    "all the models are consistent with the available observational constraints as they are fairly uncertain ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for more constraints ) ; here we show proximity effect measurements from @xcite .",
    "if we take the @xmath75 measurement of @xmath66 at face value and modify @xmath76 to match it , this would result in an increase in @xmath73 by 0.2  dex at @xmath75 , and a subsequent recovery back to the original track by @xmath77 .",
    "this would be an odd detour in its evolution , implying a peak in photoionizing flux at @xmath78 along with a secondary peak at @xmath79 as in the original @xcite evolution . in this case the peak epoch of @xmath80 would no longer correspond to the peak epoch of high - luminosity quasars , although lower luminosity quasars peaking at lower redshifts could provide a significant contribution  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the constant wind and no wind cases have identical values of @xmath67 , while the vzw case is lower . in the simplest view , winds tend to add energy to the igm , resulting in less ly@xmath2  absorption , and hence one needs smaller optical depths and a lower @xmath67 . in detail however , because @xmath66 is dominated by marginally saturated absorbers , the relevant issue is whether the winds are heating gas giving rise to those absorbers in particular .",
    "it turns out that vzw , owing to its smaller wind speeds from typical galaxies , tends to deposit energy closer to galaxies where strong absorbers arise , while cw tends to deposit energy far away in more diffuse gas , as we will discuss in  [ sec : igmphys ] .",
    "hence we believe that although cw adds more energy to the igm overall , this does not impact @xmath66 nearly as much as in vzw .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows an example spectrum from @xmath81 along an identical line of sight ( los ) through our three wind simulations .",
    "the ly@xmath2  forest is fairly sparse at these epochs , but many very weak lines exist that could be detected given sufficient observational capabilities .",
    "the mean absorption is similar by construction , but there are distinct variations evident particularly between the cw case and the other two .",
    "the expanded segment in the right panels highlights a region that shows significant differences among all three wind models .",
    "the density structure is mostly independent of outflows , though small differences are evident , but the igm temperature can be significantly impacted by wind energy .",
    "the constant wind case shows a higher temperature almost everywhere along the los , while the temperatures for vzw and nw are fairly similar .",
    "however , the fact that optical depths are not very sensitive to temperature makes these differences difficult to pick out in the observed spectra .",
    "overall , winds do not have a strong impact on the physics or absorption properties along typical lines of sight , as we will demonstrate more quantitatively with ly@xmath2  absorber statistics .",
    "-0.6 in    -0.7 in    the left panels of figure  [ fig : rhot ] shows cosmic phase diagrams of baryons , i.e. overdensity versus temperature , in our fiducial vzw run at redshifts from @xmath82 .",
    "the trends shown are familiar . at the lowest densities",
    "there is a tight density - temperature relation set by a competition between photoionization heating and adiabatic cooling owing to hubble expansion . at roughly the cosmic mean density ,",
    "shock heating begins on collapsing filamentary structures , creating a plume of hotter gas . at higher densities ,",
    "radiative cooling becomes effective , creating the spur of dense gas that fuels star formation in galaxies .",
    "the other wind models look qualitatively similar .    two perhaps unfamiliar features are the shelf of gas sitting at @xmath83k , which is metal - enriched gas outside of star formation regions ( we truncate all cooling at @xmath84k ) , and the upwards - curving plume of the densest gas , which is a consequence of the two - phase interstellar medium implementation of @xcite .",
    "the temperature in the two - phase regime is given by a mass - weighted average of the subgrid hot phase , assumed to be at @xmath85  k , and the mass - dominant cold phase at @xmath86  k. neither of these features are physical ; they simply represent computational conveniences .    from redshift 2 to 0",
    ", we see the growth of galaxies and large - scale structure playing out in the cosmic phase diagram .",
    "the denser phases become more heavily populated , as does the plume of shock - heated whim gas , though the hotter phases are still clearly populated even at @xmath56 .",
    "the hottest gas also grows most substantially owing to the formation of large potential wells at late times .",
    "the diffuse gas extends into lower overdensity regions at late times , as voids become more empty , and its temperature drops with time as the physical density and photoionization rates go down .",
    "the overall cosmic gas temperature distribution becomes broader with time , and shifts to slightly higher temperatures , driven by the increasing fraction in whim and hot halo gas .",
    "these trends have all been noted and described in previous works  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      in figure",
    "[ fig : rhot ] we have also subdivided our baryons into four cosmic phases .",
    "the subdivisions are slighly different than conventional ones  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in which diffuse baryons are at @xmath87  k , whim gas is @xmath88  k , hot gas is @xmath89  k , and condensed baryons are at a fairly high overdensity .",
    "our new divisions are intended to be more physically - motivated , particularly in the case of the whim , though in practice they do not represent dramatic changes .",
    "the main difference is that we divide the phases according to an overdensity threshold .",
    "this threshold is intended to reflect the overdensity ( @xmath90 ) at the boundary of a virialized halo . to determine this",
    ", we note that for reasonable choices of the @xcite concentration parameter @xmath91 , the density at the virial radius is roughly one - third the mean enclosed density , which is approximately @xmath92 for low values of concentrations corresponding to objects just undergoing collapse . ] .",
    "we thus obtain  @xcite @xmath93 where @xmath94 @xmath95 serves as our division between  bound \" phases ( gas in galaxies and halos ) and  intergalactic \" phases ( whim and diffuse gas ) .",
    "the value of @xmath96 evolves from @xmath97 at @xmath98 to @xmath99 at @xmath12 .",
    "this boundary is not completely sharp , as some gas that has higher overdensities is not yet bound , and owing to the elliptical nature of halos some bound gas can have lower overdensities than @xmath95 .",
    "we checked this definition by running a spherical overdensity halo finder  @xcite , and checking that equation  ( [ eqn : deltath ] ) faithfully and robustly separated gas within halos from gas outside .",
    "it indeed did so , as unbound gas was never more than a couple tenths of a dex in density into the bound region , and vice versa .",
    "we further separate the  hot \" phases ( whim and hot halo gas ) from  cool phases \" ( diffuse and condensed gas ) by a temperature threshold of @xmath100  k , the same value used in earlier definitions . at high densities , all gas that is star - forming",
    "is included in the condensed phase , although the subgrid two - phase model creates a mean gas particle temperature that can exceed @xmath101 . at igm densities , this represents the temperature above which the neutral fraction starts to drop dramatically , making ly@xmath2  absorption a poor tracer of its baryonic content ( though as we will see later , wide ly@xmath2  absorbers can still trace this gas ) .",
    "furthermore , since photoionization can not easily heat gas to these temperatures , it demarcates gas that has been shock - heated by large - scale structure . from figure",
    "[ fig : rhot ] , one can see that some gas at @xmath102  k is also shock - heated above the photoionization locus , but the locus itself extends to @xmath103  k , at least at @xmath104 .    with these divisions , we have four phases as follows :    * diffuse ( @xmath105 ) , * whim ( @xmath106 ) , * hot halo ( @xmath107 ) , * condensed ( @xmath108 ) ,    with the qualification that two - phase star - forming gas is `` condensed '' regardless of temperature . the most significant departure from previous definitions",
    "is that of the whim gas . unlike the common definition in which @xmath109  k gas is whim regardless of density ,",
    "the whim gas in our definition is truly intergalactic , in the sense that it is not within the boundaries of a galaxy or its halo .",
    "also , since hot gas is most commonly detected in x - ray emission , which roughly scales as @xmath110 ( neglecting metal line emission for the sake of this argument ) , this lower - density gas is more likely to be  missing \" from current observational censuses .",
    "for instance , our definition removes hot gas in galaxy groups at @xmath111  kev from being part of the whim ; such gas can be detected in soft x - rays  @xcite because its high density ( relative to truly intergalactic gas ) leads to significant emission , albeit at faint levels .",
    "hence , our revised definition more closely reflects the idea that the whim is the repository of the `` missing '' cosmic baryons .",
    "eliminating the upper limit of @xmath112  k for the whim has minimal impact , since very little gas with @xmath113 has such high temperatures .",
    "the right panels of figure  [ fig : rhot ] show the @xmath12 cosmic phase diagram for our other simulations : nw , cw , and vzw-96 . comparing vzw-96 to vzw , we see some subtle differences particularly in the high - temperature gas .",
    "the hot halo gas extends to slightly higher temperatures , owing to larger halos being able to form in the @xmath53 volume ; this causes a slightly higher median temperature for this phase , from @xmath114  k to @xmath115  k. similarly , the whim gas extends to slightly higher temperatures , causing a comparable increase in median whim temperature .",
    "the cooler phases show no appreciable physical differences .",
    "there is also a feature in the condensed phase at @xmath116 corresponding to a slightly different implementation of the two - phase cutoff in this run , but this does not affect any of our results .",
    "the no - wind case also shows some differences with respect to vzw . although the distribution of whim gas in phase space is similar , the median temperature increases slightly from @xmath117  k to @xmath118  k , just as in the vzw-96 case but for a different reason . here",
    ", the main effect is that with no outflows , the igm is almost completely unenriched  @xcite .",
    "hence there is no metal cooling in this regime , which yields somewhat higher temperatures .",
    "for the same reason , the condensed phase shows almost no particles at the @xmath84  k metal cooling floor .",
    "the constant wind model noticeably pushes whim gas into a lower - density regime compared to vzw , but its median temperature is lower ( @xmath119  k ) since the diffuse igm is more enriched  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the hot phase temperature is higher by @xmath120  dex , reflecting the significant igm heating that occurs when winds from all galaxies , even small ones , are emanating at @xmath121 . these results are qualitatively similar to those from @xcite who explore a similar wind model , and they further note that black hole feedback ( as they implement it ) causes even more heating of particularly low - density gas .",
    "it is also similar to results from mesh hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite , who found that winds increase the mass fraction in the whim by 20% .",
    "hence , it is possible to non - trivially impact the cosmic distribution of baryons in phase space with plausible outflows .",
    "-0.5 in    -0.5 in    we now quantify the trends in the cosmic phase diagram by examining the evolution of baryons in each phase amongst our various simulations .",
    "as is apparent from figure  [ fig : rhot ] , baryons progressively move from the diffuse phase into whim and hot halo gas , owing to the hierarchical growth of large potential wells .",
    "the condensed phase gas is supplied predominantly from cold mode accretion but also some cooling from halo gas  @xcite , and this provides the fuel to grow the cosmic stellar content . by @xmath12",
    ", baryons are comparably divided between diffuse , whim , and the various bound phases , as was found in @xcite .",
    "however , the new definition of the whim yields somewhat less whim gas and more diffuse gas , tilting the balance towards diffuse gas overall .",
    "the precise balance between the diffuse and whim phases is also sensitive to the adopted value of @xmath122 , as one can see from figure  [ fig : rhot ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : baryphase ] , top left panel , shows the fraction of baryons in each cosmic phase from @xmath123 in our vzw run .",
    "we additionally show the evolution of baryons in stars .",
    "qualitatively , the behavior is very similar to that seen in all cosmological hydrodynamic simulations  @xcite , as discussed above .",
    "the next five panels of figure  [ fig : baryphase ] show a comparison of individual phase evolution for our three wind prescriptions , plus our large - volume vzw-96 run .",
    "the upper right panel shows the evolution of the global stellar content , i.e. the integral of cosmic average star formation rate density vs. redshift  @xcite , in each wind run .",
    "note that these values account for stellar evolution which returns material back into the gas phase .",
    "the no - wind case produces by far the most stars , which is the well - known result that without strong feedback , there is a severe overcooling problem  @xcite .",
    "a stellar baryon fraction today of @xmath124 far exceeds current observational values of @xmath125  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . though we do nt show it here ,",
    "this case is also poorly resolution - converged , as pointed out by @xcite , and hence the problem would be worse at higher resolution .",
    "by contrast , both wind models do a good job of suppressing star formation .",
    "their globally averaged star formation rates are almost identical down to @xmath34 , which is by design as the wind prescriptions are tuned to reproduce the observed star formation rates up to this epoch . at lower redshifts ,",
    "there start to be greater differences . because the vzw model has more recycling of wind material back into galaxies",
    ", it provides more fuel for late - time star formation  @xcite .",
    "none of our simulations includes a prescription ( e.g. , agn feedback ) to truncate star formation in the most massive systems as observed , which would lower the predicted stellar fractions particularly at late times .",
    "the resolution dependence of global star formation is mitigated by the presence of outflows , as shown by @xcite for the cw case , and as shown here by comparing vzw and vzw-96 .",
    "both wind models are generally consistent with the currently favoured values of the stellar baryon content today of @xmath126  @xcite .",
    "the middle left panel shows whim evolution , which displays significant variations , particularly between models with and without galactic winds .",
    "the modest wind speeds of the vzw model do not heat much gas to whim temperatures compared to the purely gravitational ( nw ) case , but there is still some heating evident at high-@xmath8 , which diminishes to @xmath12 .",
    "the cw case shows a significant amount of whim gas even at @xmath127 , and the whim fraction increases faster than in the other cases down to @xmath28 . at this point",
    "the supply of wind energy abates , and the whim fraction levels off and actually falls slightly to @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite found less dramatic effect on the whim fraction with similar simulations , although the energy input from their winds is half of ours .",
    "these differences highlight an important point : galactic winds can in principle have a strong effect on the evolution of whim gas .",
    "the winds in our favoured model do not substantially affect the whim , but faster winds in plausible variant models can do so .",
    "measuring the evolution of the global whim content could provide constraints on the large - scale thermal impact of outflows .",
    "such measurements will be challenging given the difficulty of quantifying the whim even at the present epoch , but the redshifting of some uv tracer lines to longer wavelengths could potentially facilitate such measurements .",
    "the middle right panel shows hot bound gas evolution . in general this",
    "is dominated by gravitational heating from large potential wells , as indicated by the no - wind model .",
    "the vzw case produces more hot bound gas at late times , as it removes material from galaxies and places it into their surrounding hot halos .",
    "since the wind speed scales with escape velocity , large galaxies can have outflow velocities that exceed the wind speed of the cw model , which provides greater heating in their large halos .",
    "the cw model removes a significant amount of hot gas at early times because its high - speed winds can escape smaller potential wells , but at late times the potential wells become deep enough to retain the gas , and its hot phase rises more quickly .",
    "still , even by @xmath12 this model does not produce as much hot bound gas as the vzw model .",
    "the vzw-96 and vzw simulations are very similar again , showing that simulation volume effects are not important even for large potential wells in terms of their global mass content .    in the lower left panel ,",
    "the diffuse phase shows similar trends in all the models .",
    "the vzw winds have little impact on the diffuse gas content , as their typically modest velocities do not produce substantial igm heating .",
    "the cw winds lower the diffuse gas fraction at high-@xmath8 by shock heating some igm gas above @xmath128  k. this heating produces noticeable broadening of high-@xmath8 metal lines , leading to worse agreement ( relative to vzw ) with observed line widths @xcite . at late times , heating of the low density igm declines because of the reduced global star formation and the trapping of the constant-@xmath18 winds by deeper potential wells , causing the diffuse phase fraction to return to the no - wind value by @xmath129 .",
    "the box size has a negligibly small impact on this phase  the cyan vzw-96 curve is hidden by the overlaid green vzw curve at all but the highest redshifts .",
    "the bottom right panel shows the condensed phase evolution .",
    "the overall trend for this phase is to increase at early epochs as material accumulates in halos , then decrease towards later times as galaxies convert gas to stars more rapidly than they accrete fresh gas .",
    "the fraction of condensed gas is @xmath130% at all times and @xmath131 today , in all the models .",
    "the cw model shows a fixed offset to lower condensed gas fractions relative to the no - wind model , since it expels a constant amount of material out of the star - forming regions , and most of this material ends up outside of halos owing to the large wind speed .",
    "the vzw model shows qualitatively different behavior from the others , with less redshift evolution .",
    "mostly this difference reflects the late - time reaccretion of wind material , more prominent in the vzw model because of lower wind speeds @xcite .",
    "we note the qualitative similarity of the evolution of this phase ( which contains most of the cosmic neutral gas ) with the observed evolution of cosmic gas from damped ly@xmath2  systems  @xcite , being roughly constant from @xmath132 and then dropping to @xmath12 .",
    "returning to figure  [ fig : rhot ] , the histograms along the vertical axis show the temperature distribution of baryons at @xmath133 .",
    "the overall trend follows the movement of baryons within the cosmic phase diagram , namely that the median temperature increases with time . in detail",
    ", the diffuse phase actually moves towards lower temperatures because of the changing balance between photionization heating and adiabatic cooling .",
    "the whim gas extends up to higher temperatures at low-@xmath8 , and the hot bound gas also becomes hotter on average as larger potential wells form .",
    "the median cosmic gas temperature today is @xmath134  k.    overall , the cosmic evolution of baryon phases reflects the hydrodynamic and radiative processes associated with the growth of structure .",
    "winds have a significant impact , particularly on the stellar phase ( by design ) and on the whim phase ( if the winds are strong enough ) .",
    "they also impact the bound phases ( hot halo and condensed ) , since these lie close to galaxies where winds play a more important dynamical role .",
    "the diffuse phase is mostly unaffected by winds .",
    "the complex dynamical interplay between outflows and hierarchical growth is an important factor in the cosmic history of baryons , and improved observational constraints and theoretical predictions will be required to fully characterise it .",

    "we consider the canonical statistics of the column density and linewidth distributions , as well as the evolution of the number density of lines .",
    "to obtain line statistics , we fit our simulated spectra with voigt profiles using autovp  @xcite , yielding an column density ( @xmath135 ) , doppler line width ( @xmath136 ) , and redshift for each absorber . owing to the sparseness of the low-@xmath8 ly@xmath2  forest , the fits are generally unambiguous , and tests have shown that autovp  obtains line parameters very similar to that from other voigt profile fitters ( e.g. vpfit ) when the lines are unsaturated .",
    "we use the continuum directly provided by the simulations , as we assume that observed spectra can be fit with an accurate continuum in the relatively sparse low-@xmath8 ly@xmath2  forest .",
    "we also examine the impact of varying the assumed signal - to - noise ratio and spectral resolution of our simulated spectra .",
    "note that autovp provides `` raw '' @xmath136-parameters uncorrected for instrumental resolution . in our cos - resolution spectra , with a gaussian width of @xmath137",
    ", we therefore expect essentially no lines with @xmath138 .",
    "since it turns out that the vzw-96 absorber statistics are indistinguishable from the vzw case ( as anticipated by the close agreement in igm physical properties ) , we do not show this model herein .",

    "results are shown for all three of our outflow models .",
    "the column density distribution ( cdd ) @xmath140 has been multiplied by @xmath135 to remove some of the steep power - law scaling ( discussed below ) , which enhances the visibility of the differences among models .",
    "it also results in a dimensionless number that reflects the relative number of lines per unit redshift at a given @xmath135 .",
    "the cdd shows the usual power - law behaviour , above the completeness limit at @xmath141 that results from our adopted s / n and resolution ( see  [ sec : res ] ) . characterizing the column density distribution as a power law with @xmath142 , and fitting between @xmath143",
    ", we obtain values of @xmath144 for the nw , vzw , and cw models at @xmath12 , respectively , with an uncertainty of approximately @xmath145 on each .",
    "hence , all the slopes are formally consistent with each other , although given that the exact same los are being analyzed , one can conclude that the nw model produces a steeper slope than the wind models , and that the vzw model produces the shallowest slope .",
    "we note that all the slopes are shallower than the slope @xmath146 obtained in the simulation by @xcite ( though within formal uncertainties ) , which was most analogous to the no - wind case here .",
    "we will show in  [ sec : res ] that higher spectral resolution tends to produce a somewhat steeper slope , so this could explain part of the difference .",
    "@xcite found a slope of @xmath147 using a fixed mesh simulation with 75  kpc resolution and no galactic outflows , which basically agrees with our no - wind case .",
    "these are several pre - cos set of low-@xmath8 ly@xmath2  forest data for comparison .",
    "one sample , from @xcite , contains 187 somewhat heterogeneous ly@xmath2  absorbers , mostly at @xmath148 , from _",
    "hubble_/stis and goddard high resolution spectrograph data .",

    "the slope obtained by @xcite is @xmath151 , which is statistically different from that of @xcite ( @xmath152 ) or @xcite ( @xmath146 ) . as we will show in  [ sec : res ] , at least part of the difference likely owes to spectral resolution , since higher resolution data yields steeper slopes .",
    "for this reason it is not straightforward to compare to the cos predictions presented here to these data , but broadly the slope and amplitude predicted by the current simulations are in agreement given the various uncertainties .",
    "a careful comparison against upcoming cos data should provide more discrimination between models .    at higher column densities",

    "@xcite likewise saw that the cdd slope is shallower at @xmath154 than for smaller systems .",
    "we see a hint of the onset of such a dip in all our simulations , but we can not accurately trace it out to @xmath155 , since we quickly run out of absorbers owing to the rarity of high-@xmath135 absorbers along our randomly - chosen los .",
    "the origin of this dip is unclear .",
    "it occurs at a column density close to that expected for overdensities near the boundaries of galaxy halos , which leads us to speculate that perhaps these absorbers probe the outer parts of galaxy halos where ( at least in larger halos ) some of the gas might be shock - heated to a temperature where it would not absorb in . at even higher columns , one",
    "would then probe through denser halo regions where condenses out again , owing to self - shielding , causing a  recovery \" back to the original cdd .",
    "we leave a detailed examination of this conjecture for future work .",
    "the redshift evolution of the cdd shows a steady march upwards in line counts at a given @xmath135 ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "the overall steady evolution reflects the evolution of the mean flux decrement over this redshift range , and hence is dependent on our procedure of adjusting the ionizing background strength to match @xmath68 .",
    "the incompleteness at @xmath157 becomes more severe at higher-@xmath8 , as line blending becomes more common .",
    "recall that we have fixed our resolution and line spread function to the cos far - uv channel at all @xmath8 , which underestimates the data quality that is obtainable at @xmath28 ( where the cos nuv channel has a narrower lsf , albeit with lower sensitivity ) and at @xmath34 ( where one can trace the ly@xmath2  forest in the optical ) .",
    "this makes it difficult to compare slopes across a fixed @xmath135 range , but if we restrict ourselves to @xmath158 where the cdd is reasonably complete at all @xmath8 , we obtain slopes for the vzw model of @xmath159 , and @xmath160 at @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "the cdd is clearly getting steeper with time , broadly matching the observed cdd slope evolution from high-@xmath8  ( @xmath161 , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the cdds are remarkably insensitive to the outflow model at lower column densities .",
    "wind dynamics , despite enriching the igm and depositing energy over large scales in quite different ways , have little impact on the diffuse distribution .",
    "as shown by @xcite and @xcite , the typical extent of galactic winds ( @xmath162  kpc physical ) generally does not extend into the diffuse ly@xmath2  forest .",
    "this was noted in the earliest simulation studies of ly@xmath2  absorption that explored outflows  @xcite . however , there are significant differences for stronger absorbers , as outflows ( particularly in the vzw case ) deposit more cool gas in the outskirts of halos , which increases the ly@xmath2  absorbing cross - section .",

    "examination of the true column densities in the simulated absorbers shows that the high column density systems identified in the stis - resolution spectra are generally real ; at cos resolution autovp  mischaracterizes them as lower column density systems with larger @xmath136-parameters ( and thus less saturation ) .",

    "the peak of the distribution moves much closer to that of the cos distributions , suggesting that for many lines the larger cos @xmath136-parameter is a simple consequence of convolving the line with a broader lsf .",
    "however , the cos distributions still have many more lines at @xmath192 , showing that these broad lines must arise mainly from blends that can not be resolved by the cos fuv channel . because of the effects of line - blending",

    "the departures from this relation also become more prominent with time , since more igm gas becomes shock - heated .",
    "condensed phase gas typically gives rise to the strongest ly@xmath2  absorption systems seen at the highest overdensities . at @xmath56",
    "there is a shelf at the lowest densities , largely because the underdense absorbers have larger velocity widths and are thus more difficult to identify at fixed @xmath135 and s / n .",

    "if lines were purely thermally broadened , then the linewidth would be related to the temperature by @xmath228 .",
    "this relation is shown as the solid diagonal line . a small fraction of whim and hot absorbers are narrower than allowed by thermal broadening , either because of @xmath136-parameter uncertainties in the voigt profile fits or because of uncertainties in assigning temperatures to absorbers as described above .",

    "the thermal contribution becomes smaller .",

    "our scenario for the nature and evolution of ly@xmath2  forest absorbers from @xmath0 remains basically unchanged : most absorbers arise in low - overdensity , highly photoionized gas that traces uncollapsed large - scale filaments .",
    "@xcite argued that much of the observed evolution in the ly@xmath2  forest can be understood in terms of the evolving relationship between column density and the overdensity of the absorbing gas ; our latest simulations yield a similar slope and evolution of this relation .",

    "our statistical results for ly@xmath2  forest absorbers are obtained by applying the autovp line - fitter @xcite to artificial spectra with a resolution and s / n similar to those expected for typical cos observations .",
    "our main results are as follows :    * baryons at @xmath36 are divided comparably amongst the diffuse phase , the whim , and the bound phases ( condensed , hot halo , and stars ) , the whim here is defined as low - density ( outside of halos ) gas with @xmath4  k , a notable change from previous definitions that impose a maximum temperature but not a maximum density . in detail , our favoured momentum - driven outflow model has 41% in diffuse gas , 35% in bound phases , and 24% in whim at @xmath12 , with values for other wind models and redshifts shown in figure  [ fig : baryphase ] . *",
    "our favoured momentum - driven wind ( vzw ) model shows similar evolution in diffuse ( unbound ) igm baryonic phases to the no - wind ( nw ) case .",
    "in contrast , the condensed , hot halo , and stellar fractions are all noticeably different between those two , and between either of these models and the constant wind ( cw ) model .",

    "the shallower vzw slope arises because it produces more strong ( @xmath238 ) lines at @xmath12 , which agrees better with observations of @xmath170 evolution .",
    "weaker lines show no differences in @xmath170 among wind models , but they do indicate a discrepancy around @xmath28 that may reflect deviations from the @xcite ionizing background evolution . *",

    "<S> the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is the dominant reservoir of baryons at all cosmic epochs . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate the evolution of the igm from @xmath0 in @xmath1 , 110-million particle cosmological hydrodynamic simulations using three prescriptions for galactic outflows . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the evolution of igm physical properties , and how such properties are traced by ly@xmath2  absorption as detectable using _ </S>",
    "<S> hubble s _ cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results broadly confirm the canonical picture that most ly@xmath2  absorbers arise from highly ionized gas tracing filamentary large - scale structure . </S>",
    "<S> growth of structure causes gas to move from the diffuse photoionized igm into other cosmic phases , namely stars , cold and hot gas within galaxy halos , and the unbound and shock - heated warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) . by today </S>",
    "<S> , baryons are comparably divided between bound phases ( 35% in our favoured outflow model ) , the diffuse igm ( 41% ) , and the whim ( 24% ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we ( re)define the whim as gas with overdensities lower than that in halos ( @xmath3 today ) and temperatures @xmath4  k , to more closely align it with the  missing baryons \" that are not easily detectable in emission or ly@xmath2  absorption . </S>",
    "<S> strong galactic outflows can have a noticeable impact on the temperature of the igm , though with our favoured momentum - driven wind scalings they do not . </S>",
    "<S> when we ( mildly ) tune our assumed photoionizing background to match the observed evolution of the ly@xmath2  mean flux decrement , we obtain line count evolution statistics that broadly agree with available ( pre - cos ) observations . </S>",
    "<S> we predict a column density distribution slope of @xmath5 for our favoured wind model , in agreement with recent observational estimates , and it becomes shallower with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> winds have a mostly minimal impact , but they do result in a shallower column density slope and more strong lines . with improved statistics , the frequency of strong lines can be a valuable diagnostic of outflows , and the momentum - driven wind model matches existing data significantly better than the two alternatives we consider . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between column density and physical density broadens mildly from @xmath0 , and evolves as @xmath6 for diffuse absorbers , consistent with previous studies . </S>",
    "<S> linewidth distributions are quite sensitive to spectral resolution ; cos should yield significantly broader lines than higher - resolution data . </S>",
    "<S> thermal contributions to linewidths are typically subdominant , so linewidths only loosely reflect the temperature of the absorbing gas . </S>",
    "<S> this will hamper attempts to quantify the whim using broad ly@xmath2  absorbers , though it may still be possible to do so statistically . </S>",
    "<S> together , cos data and simulations such as these will provide key insights into the physical conditions of the dominant reservoir of baryons over the majority of cosmic time .    </S>",
