    "this is the method of `` hard thermal loops '' @xcite .",
    "the essence of this method is the introduction of thermal screening masses . for electric gluons",
    "one finds a mass of the order of @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that the loop terms in are suppressed by factors of @xmath10 as compared to the leading terms .",
    "unfortunately , one finds no mass of this order for the magnetic or transverse gluons .",
    "this seems to imply that qcd at high temperatures finally is highly nonperturbative @xcite .    with the present work we are presenting a slightly modified approach which may overcome these problems and",
    "possibly will allow for an expansion in the coupling constant .",
    "the main difference to conventional approaches is that we do not rely on quasi - particles , i.e. , particles that have a definite mass - shell only slightly perturbed by the interactions .",
    "there are several arguments against the quasi - particle concept at finite temperature :    1 .",
    "a system at finite temperature does not exhibit the poincar symmetry of the vacuum state .",
    "what remains instead is a semi - direct product of the four - dimensional translation group t(4 ) and the three - dimensional rotation group so(3 ) .",

    "this is consistent with the picture of poincar symmetry restoration at @xmath13 as a `` thermal phase transition '' .",
    "it also tells us , that the basis for a perturbative expansion at @xmath13 is different from the basis at @xmath14 where we have to use a continuous mass spectrum @xcite .",
    "consequences of the kms - condition @xcite on quasi - particles have been investigated by narnhofer , requardt and thirring @xcite .",
    "their theorem essentially states that quasi - particles can be used as an approximation only if one considers length and time scales larger that @xmath1 , i.e. , the regime where the presence of thermal excitations is still negligible . 4 .",
    "probably the most severe objection against the use of quasi - particles arises in the long - time limit , i.e. , for times larger than @xmath15 . for such long times",
    "the assumption of a quasi - particle with an infinite life - time no longer holds because the presence of thermal excitations necessarily leads to scattering or absorption .",
    "attempts to calculate the damping rates in a perturbative manner from the imaginary part of the self energy or polarization _ on - shell _ must fail if the mass of the quasi - particle is smaller than @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , calculations of damping rates indicate that one has to determine such rates in a self - consistent manner , although one frequently makes the assumption that the damping rate is much smaller than the mass of the quasi - particle @xcite    it is this breakdown of the quasi - particle picture for temperatures higher than the relevant masses on which we base our procedure .",
    "we are taking this feature into account establishing simple anstze for spectral functions with a finite width .",
    "this will be the content of section 2 . in section 3",
    "we calculate the self energies and polarizations to one - loop order and determine from them the width parameters in a self - consistent manner .",

    "the safest method for the determination of green s functions uses dispersion relations .",
    "they enforce the proper analyticity in the complex energy plane by removing unphysical poles from the physical riemann sheet @xcite .",
    "the central quantity of this procedure is a spectral function @xmath16 which must be known for real @xmath17 . for arbitrary complex @xmath17 ,",
    "the retarded and advanced green s functions read @xmath18 this automatically implies that the spectral function is proportional to the imaginary part of the retarded respectively the advanced green s function : @xmath19 for perturbative calculations of the partition function one usually needs _ causal green s functions in euclidean time _ respectively their fourier transform @xmath20 with the matsubara frequencies @xcite @xmath21 these functions can be obtained from the retarded or advanced green s functions by analytic continuation in a unique manner @xcite , using the relations @xmath22 with these relations we can now define @xmath20 via dispersion integral : @xmath23 the upper sign in and is valid for fermions , the lower one for bosons ; they account for the signs when switching to euclidean space - time and euclidean @xmath24-matrices .",
    "we are interested in spectral functions with a finite _ constant _ width . for bosons ,",
    "we abbreviate the spectral width as @xmath25 for the moment , and use the spectral function @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes the energy - momentum dispersion relation .",
    "we will neglect masses and simply choose @xmath28 .",
    "the spectral function is normalized according to the commutation relations for bosonic fields : @xmath29 the corresponding euclidean green s function can now be obtained using eqns . and : @xmath30 in the limit of vanishing width , @xmath31 , one recovers the usual perturbative matsubara green s function @xmath32 .",
    "a remarkable feature is that the green s function is _ real _ , even with @xmath33 .",
    "similarly , we proceed for fermions , where we abbreviate the spectral width as @xmath34 to distinguish it from the dirac @xmath24-matrices @xmath35 . as spectral function",

    "let us consider the spatial and temporal behavior of a retarded real - time propagator as defined in . with a boson spectral function",

    "these spectral widths are assumed to be constant and will be determined self - consistently from the lowest order self energies and polarizations at zero momentum and energy .",
    "this means that we separate the unperturbed part of the action from the interaction part in the following way : @xmath69 perturbation theory is now done with respect to @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the action of _ generalized free fields _ , which already contain the full two - point correlations present in the theory .",
    "in particular , these generalized free fields may have a continuous mass spectrum , and therefore avoid the pitfalls of the quasi - particle picture we outlined in the introduction .",

    "this procedure constitutes a certain approximation scheme we have to worry about gauge dependence .",
    "the appropriate tool in this context are brst - ward identities .",

    "we consider this a crucial point of the present paper , and emphasize the importance of the brst symmetry over particularities of the approximation scheme : from eqn",
    ". follows , that the identities should hold in every order of the _ resummed _ perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath77 .",
    "we now have to determine the three unknown parameters @xmath78 and @xmath79 . for that purpose",
    "we calculate the self energy of the quarks and the polarization tensor for the gluons to one - loop order _ with the effective propagators_. as is known from the exact integral equations for green s functions , we therefore neglect only three - point and higher correlations . up to this level",
    "however , our approximation scheme is completely consistent .    as the parameters @xmath80 and @xmath79 are due to interactions they are necessarily proportional to some positive power of the coupling constant @xmath9 times the temperature @xmath11 . at temperatures",
    "high enough in order to ensure a small coupling constant the width parameters are necessarily small compared to the temperature . therefore , we consider the limit of high temperature ( for details see appendix b ) . as we want to provide a well - defined infrared limit with our parameterization of the spectral functions we determine @xmath78 and @xmath79 precisely in this limit .",
