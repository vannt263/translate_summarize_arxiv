    "hypothesis testing is a very important component of statistical inference ; it helps us to systematically explore the veracity of an unsubstantiated claim on the basis of observed data in a real life experiment .",
    "the philosophy of the statistical hypothesis testing was mainly developed in the early decades of twentieth century by fisher and neyman and pearson @xcite ; since then the theory has evolved in many directions through the contributions of several later researchers . yet",
    "the classical likelihood ratio test ( lrt ) proposed by @xcite and formalized later by @xcite still remains our canonical hypothesis testing tool , which is used widely by the practitioners in all scenarios of human endeavor .",
    "this test can be easily performed for most statistical models and satisfies several asymptotic optimality criteria . however , as in the case of maximum likelihood estimator ( mle ) in the estimation context , the lrt also has serious robustness problems under misspecification of models and/or presence of outliers .",
    "there have been several attempts to develop robust tests of hypotheses having optimal properties similar to the lrt .",
    "the lrt can be seen to be a special case of a large class of testing procedures , known as the  disparity difference tests \" which have strong robustness properties ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "however , these tests involve kernel density estimators of the true density for continuous models and hence include all the complications associated with kernel smoothing .",
    "motivated by the success of the minimum density power divergence estimators , which require no kernel smoothing , as an alternative to the class of minimum disparity estimators , @xcite developed a class of tests using the density power divergence .",
    "this work was based on @xcite , which had developed the density power divergence measure , as well as the minimum density power divergence estimator ( mdpde ) .",
    "consider the problem of testing a simple null hypothesis based on the random sample @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath2 represent the parametric family of densities ; suppose also that the true data generating density belongs to this model family .",
    "let @xmath3 be any fixed point in the parameter space @xmath4 , which we believe to be the true value of the parameter .",
    "based on the observed sample , we want to test for the simple hypotheses @xmath5 note that in general there is no uniformly most powerful test for this testing problem .",
    "@xcite proposed to test this hypothesis by utilizing the minimum possible value of the density power divergence ( dpd ) measure between the data and a model density .",
    "although they have empirically demonstrated some of strong robustness properties of the dpd based test , their paper had no concrete theoretical results on the robustness of the proposed tests .    the present paper will focus on developing the theoretical robustness properties of the dpd based test .",
    "however , instead of doing it simply for the dpd alone , we will prove all our results for a more general class of test statistics that contains the dpd based tests as a special case .",
    "this general class of test statistics will be based on the recently developed family of @xmath0-divergences @xcite that contains both the pd ( power divergence ; cressie and read , 1984 ) and the dpd measure as its subfamilies .",
    "for all the asymptotic results throughout the paper we need to assume some standard conditions of asymptotic inference , given by assumptions a , b , c and d of @xcite . in the rest of this paper , we will refer to these conditions simply as the  _ lehmann conditions _ \" .",
    "similarly , we will also assume the conditions d1d5 of @xcite at the model , which we will refer to as the  _ basu et al .  conditions _ \" .",
    "both set of conditions , with a brief description of their implications and significances are provided in [ app : conditions ] .",
    "there is some overlap among the conditions , but taken together they exhaust the necessary technicalities .    to keep a clear focus in our discussion and to relate them directly to the empirical findings of @xcite",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to a simple null hypothesis in this paper .",
    "however , at the end of the paper , we will briefly indicate how the results can be extended to the case of composite null hypotheses .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:7sample1_simpletest ] we define the proposed test statistic based on the general family of @xmath0-divergence measures and provide its asymptotic properties .",
    "several robustness measures of this test are derived in section [ sec:7sample1_simpletest_robust ] .",
    "section [ sec:7example_simple ] presents a numerical illustration of all the theoretical results derived in this paper through the problem of testing for the normal mean with a known variance . in section [ sec : choice_tuning ] we present some general remarks integrating the theoretical results and numerical findings presented in this paper ; in this section we also give some guidance on the choice of appropriate tuning parameter for the proposed test .",
    "section [ sec : composite ] briefly indicates the possible generalization to the case of the composite null hypotheses .",
    "some concluding remarks are presented in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the @xmath0-divergence measure , recently proposed by @xcite , is a general family of divergence measures ( between two density functions ) containing several popular divergences including the power divergence ( pd ) family of cressie and read ( 1984 ) and the density power divergence ( dpd ) family of @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-divergence between the densities @xmath6 and @xmath7 is defined in terms of two parameters @xmath8 $ ] and @xmath9 as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for the cases @xmath13 or @xmath14",
    ", the corresponding @xmath0-divergence measure is defined by the respective continuous limits of the expression in equation ( [ eq : s_div_gen ] ) , which yield @xmath15 and @xmath16 interestingly , note that at @xmath17 the @xmath0-divergence measure becomes independent of the parameter @xmath18 and coincides with the squared @xmath19-distance . on the other hand ,",
    "at @xmath20 it reduces to the pd family of cressie and read ( 1984 ) with parameter @xmath18 .",
    "further , note that the @xmath0-divergence family also contains the dpd measure with parameter @xmath21 , given by @xmath22 as one of its special cases when @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , it is natural to reconstruct the dpd based test statistics proposed by @xcite using this general family of @xmath0-divergences",
    ".    consider the problem of testing the simple null hypothesis as described in equation ( [ eq:7simple_hyp ] ) under the parametric set - up of section 1 .",
    "we define the general test statistic based on the @xmath0-divergence with parameter @xmath24 and @xmath18 as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the minimum dpd estimator ( mdpde ) of @xmath27 obtained by minimizing the dpd with tuning parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the intuitive rationale behind construction of this test statistics is as follows : when the model is correctly specified and the assumed null hypothesis @xmath29 is correct , @xmath30 is the true data generating density and so it can be tested by considering the magnitude of the @xmath0-divergence measure between @xmath30 and @xmath31 for any consistent estimator @xmath32 of @xmath27 based on the observed sample . since the divergence employed in the definition of the statistic in equation ( [ eq : sdt ] ) is the @xmath0-divergence , the ideal choice for @xmath32 should be the minimum @xmath0-divergence estimator . the choice of @xmath26 , the mdpde of @xmath27 corresponding to tuning parameter @xmath28 , is preferred by us since the only subfamily in the @xmath0-divergence family that does not require the use of kernel density estimator is the dpd family .",
    "note that , by putting @xmath23 this general test statistic coincides with the dpd based test statistic of @xcite , whereas with the choice @xmath33 it becomes equivalent to the lrt .    in the rest of the paper",
    "we refer to the test statistic @xmath34 in the singular , although in effect we are taking a family of test statistics that vary over the tuning parameters .",
    "we will prove our results for a generic statistic , where the asymptotic distribution is a function of @xmath24 , @xmath18 and @xmath28 .",
    "we first prove some asymptotic properties of this general @xmath0-divergence based test ( which we will refer to as the sdt ) to obtain the critical points and power approximation of the test .",
    "for these , we require that the minimum dpd estimator used in constructing the test statistics is @xmath35-consistent and asymptotically normal , which hold under the basu et al .",
    "conditions @xcite .    then , the asymptotic variance - covariance matrix of the mdpde @xmath26 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 we can now derive the asymptotic null distribution of the sdt as given in the following theorem .",
    "suppose the model density satisfies the lehmann and basu et al",
    ".  conditions .",
    "the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic @xmath39 , under the null hypothesis @xmath40 , coincides with the distribution of @xmath41 where @xmath42 are independent standard normal variables , @xmath43 are the nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 [ thm:7asymp_null_one ]    the proof of the above theorem is a routine extension of the proof of the dpd based test provided by @xcite and is omitted .",
    "note that the minimum @xmath0-divergence estimator corresponding to parameter @xmath28 and @xmath18 is first order equivalent to the minimum dpd estimator with parameter @xmath28 in the sense that they have the same asymptotic distribution @xcite .",
    "so , if one were to replace the minimum dpd estimator @xmath26 in ( [ eq : sdt ] ) with the minimum @xmath0-divergence estimator corresponding to @xmath28 and @xmath18 , one would still get the same asymptotic null distribution as in theorem [ thm:7asymp_null_one ] ; this null distribution is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "this allows us to study the class of tests in ( [ eq : sdt ] ) in a more general setting than what is observed at face value .",
    "we could have made the set up fully general by actually substituting @xmath26 with the minimum @xmath0-divergence estimator at @xmath28 and @xmath18 in equation ( [ eq : sdt ] ) .",
    "but the general @xmath0-divergence estimator involves the construction of a non - parametric density estimator and inherits its associated problems , and so the value addition due to the generality might be offset by its cost .",
    "instead we stick to the formulation in ( [ eq : sdt ] ) , which gives us the same asymptotic distribution as the most general case , but also gives us a robust set of procedures without getting into the issue of non - parametric kernel density estimation .",
    "it also allows us to study the theoretical properties of the tests of @xcite as a special case of our formulation .",
    "one could also find the asymptotic critical values of the test in ( [ eq : sdt ] ) on the basis of the suggestion in remark 3 of @xcite .",
    "our next theorem presents a power approximation of the above sdt , which can help us to obtain the minimum sample size required in order to achieve some pre - specified power of the test .",

    "also , this influence function will be bounded if and only if the influence function of the minimum density power divergence functional is bounded .",
    "@xcite derived the influence function of the mdpde which is bounded for all @xmath80 under most common parametric models ; however it is generally unbounded at @xmath81 . noting that the mdpde with @xmath81 is indeed the mle",
    ", it shows that the use of a non - robust estimator like the mle leads to a non - robust overall test procedure as well .",
    "next we consider the effect of contamination on the level and power of the proposed test which will give us a clearer picture about the robustness of the test . as",
    "the test is consistent , we study its power under the contiguous alternative hypotheses @xmath82 with @xmath83 being a vector of positive reals having the same dimension as the parameter vector and @xmath84 . in order to explore the effect of contamination on the power and size of the test",

    "so part ( ii ) of theorem [ thm:7asymp_power_one ] gives an alternative approximation to the critical values of the proposed sdt based on a suitable truncation of the infinite series .",

    "both the empirical power and size are quite stable and almost independent of @xmath18 ; in this region the powers are found to be satisfactory high values and sizes are quite close to their nominal levels .",

    "empirically , we have observed that this is the preferable region in the sense that they maintain levels close to the nominal level and exhibit reasonably high powers .",
    "tests that can not maintain the nominal level are usually of little practical value as one does not know whether a higher observed power is an actual phenomenon or the consequence of an unstable size .",
    "so , we do not advocate the use of such tests which have highly variable sizes in small sample .",
    "although we have focused only on simple hypothesis testing throughout the present paper , it is worth noting that all the concepts and results derived for the simple null can be generalized for composite hypothesis testing .",
    "this would indicate a wider scope for the proposals in this paper and their significance .",
