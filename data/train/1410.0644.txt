    "it is believed by most astro - cosmologists as well as astro - particle physicists that the only solution to resolve the flatness and horizon problems in the universe is to think of exponential expansion called inflation  @xcite right after birth of our universe . in recent years",
    "several observational results to confirm the inflation were reported  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the most important evidence in the present days to provide data is the temperature fluctuation of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) which shows us quantitatively that there was the era of the inflation in the early universe . using this data we can investigate the mechanism of the inflationary expansion in detail .",
    "the cmb is the photon emitted in the recombination era of which the wavelength is very long so that cmb reaches us without much scattering afterwards .",
    "therefore cmb carries to us the information of the early universe .",
    "the most peculiar properties of cmb is that it is homogeneous and uniform with very high accuracy and furthermore the spectrum agrees very well with the black body radiation with the temperature 2.725 [ k ] while the temperature fluctuation @xmath7 is of the order of @xmath8 .",
    "this temperature fluctuation is believed to come from the gravitational potential @xmath9 through sachs - wolfe effect @xmath10  @xcite . in the usual inflation models",
    "the gravitational potential @xmath9 is believed to be created when the hypothetical scalar particle(s ) called inflaton(s ) fluctuates quantum mechanically during rolling down classically along with the potential .",
    "there are many models proposed for creation mechanism , such as slow - roll inflation  @xcite , chaotic inflation  @xcite etc .",
    "in our previous papers  @xcite , we show that the temperature fluctuation of cmb can be explained as the vacuum fluctuation of a large number of matter fields . here",
    "the matter fields are originated from the string excited states and/or the kaluza - klein modes on the compactified space . there",
    "appear very many kinds of fields in the exponentially expanding universe , where the hubble parameter plays the role of temperature .",
    "these fields fluctuate around the bottom of the mass potential , and generate the energy density of fluctuation .",
    "finally the fluctuation creates the gravitational potential @xmath9 through the einstein equation .",
    "although each fluctuation due to single field is very small , but enormous number of species of fields contribute and it turns out to be summed up to a huge fluctuation compatible to the present observational value . furthermore it is possible to determine the radii of the compactified spaces , as well as the string coupling constant by comparison with the observational values of cmb .",
    "the very merit of our theory is in the fact that we do not need to put any assumption or fine - tuning on the form of the matter fields potential , but we simply consider free fields . however in our above described theory",
    "there still are several problems to be resolved . in the first place the spectral index @xmath11 which indicates the distance dependence of the fluctuation or , in other words , the 2-point correlation function of the fields exceeds one , i.e. @xmath12 in our model , although the observed value of the planck is @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "as was pointed out in our foregoing papers @xcite the reason why we obtained @xmath12 is in the fact that we assumed the background metric is exactly the de sitter space - time . in order to explain the experimental value of the spectral index , we may have to introduce a time dependent hubble parameter @xmath2 , something like @xmath14 .",
    "so far we have not discussed the origin of the inflation , and simply assumed the de sitter space - time . in this paper",
    "we point out the possibility that the inflation is caused by the vacuum energy of the many fields in the expanding universe .",
    "it is the purpose of the present article that we present a self - consistent theory of the time evolution of the universe by incorporating the backreaction of the quantized matter fields .",
    "the main idea of the present paper follows our pervious articles @xcite , except that we do not assume de sitter background and incorporate the backreaction of the matter fields . in the early universe we consider @xmath15 species of the free scalar fields .",
    "the time evolution of the early universe is assumed to follow the classical einstein equation , @xmath16 on the right hand side the energy - momentum tensor of the species @xmath17 of the matter fields is regarded as the vacuum expectation value @xmath18 , in the metric @xmath19 .",
    "when one expresses @xmath18 by a functional of arbitrary metric @xmath19 , @xmath20 $ ] , the einstein equation ( [ 1-einstein.eq ] ) describes the time evolution of @xmath19 caused by the backreaction from the matter fields .",
    "here we take the vacuum of the bunch - davies type in the calculation of @xmath20 $ ] . as we will see @xmath20$]is proportional to @xmath21 . therefore in the early universe , where @xmath2 is large",
    ", we can ignore the initial state dependence of the energy - momentum tensor and simply take @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "we mainly use the eikonal approximation to make solutions of the equation of motion of the matter fields .",
    "then we perform the 1-loop momentum integration to calculate the correlation functions . by so doing the eq .",
    "( [ 1-einstein.eq ] ) becomes a second order differential equation for @xmath2 .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ 2 ] , we review briefly the eikonal approximation .",
    "then we investigate the solution of matter field of mass @xmath22 in two cases , that is , for the cases of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and evaluate @xmath25 for each cases . in section [ 3 ] we assume that there exist both light and heavy particles in the universe and search for de sitter - like expanding solutions of eq .",
    "( [ 1-einstein.eq ] ) , where @xmath2 is almost constant",
    ". then we examine the solutions when the hubble parameter is very small compared to that of the de sitter - like expanding era . from this analysis",
    "we will see that the hubble parameter becomes zero and the de sitter era ends for a certain region of the initial conditions .",
    "section [ 4 ] is devoted to conclusion and outlook . in appendix",

    "<S> in fact we start by quantizing a free scalar field in the friedmann - robertson - walker space - time , and the field is fluctuating quantum mechanically around the bottom of the mass potential . </S>",
    "<S> we then obtain the vacuum expectation value of the energy density of the scalar field as a functional of the scale factor @xmath0 of the universe . by plugging it into the einstein equation </S>",
    "<S> , a self - consistent equation is established in which the matter fields determine the time evolution of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> we solve this equation by setting few conditions and find the following solution : the universe expands  la de sitter with e - folding number @xmath1 and then it turns to shrink with a decreasing hubble parameter @xmath2 which rapidly goes to zero .    * a new mechanism of realizing inflationary universe + * with recourse to backreaction of quantized free fields +  inflation without inflaton  + * *    yoshinobu habara@xmath3 , hikaru kawai@xmath4 and masao ninomiya@xmath5    @xmath5okayama institute for quantum physics , 1 - 9 - 1 kyoyama , okayama 700 - 0015 , japan    @xmath6department of physics , kyoto university , kyoto 606 - 8502 , japan     habara@yukawa.kyoto-u.ac.jp , + hkawai@gauge.scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp , + msninomiya@gmail.com    pacs numbers : 04.62.+v , 98.80.cq , 11.25.-w , 11.25.mj , 98.80.qc    keywords : inflation , string theory , cosmic microwave background </S>"
