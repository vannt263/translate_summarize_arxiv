    "the original approach to the topological invariant in two dimensions was based on counting the zeroes of a function calculated from the pfaffian of a certain matrix @xcite . a different approach developed by the author",
    "was based on the obstruction of the vector bundle of wave - functions on the torus to being a trivial bundle @xcite .",
    "this yielded a formula involving the chern number of half the occupied bands .",
    "subsequent work using the obstructions approach and physical ideas related to charge polarization led to a formula involving an integral of the berry curvature of all the bands , but restricted to half the brillouin zone ( also called the effective brillouin zone(ebz ) ) @xcite . in other related work ,",
    "the topological phases in two dimensions were studied by deforming maps from the ebz to the space of bloch hamiltonians with unbroken trs , @xmath4 , to maps from a sphere or a torus to @xmath4 ( ref . ) .",
    "the formula involving the integral over the ebz in ref . has been adapted to numerical evaluations @xcite , while the formula in terms of the chern number has the advantage of having a direct link to the edge state physics and the integer quantum hall effect .",
    "a brief review of the latter formulation is provided below .",
    "the hamiltonian of a bloch insulator has single particle eigenstates , which are either occupied or unoccupied depending on their energy relative to the fermi energy .",
    "the spectral projection operator is defined as the operator that projects single particle states onto the space of occupied states .",
    "it can thus be written as sum , @xmath5 , where the @xmath6 are the occupied eigenkets .",
    "thus the projection operator can be written as : @xmath7 where the sum is over reciprocal lattice vectors lying in the brillouin zone .    as was argued in ref .",
    ", in materials with time reversal symmetry the spectral projector , @xmath8 can be written in the form : @xmath9 where the operators , @xmath10 are well - defined , continuous functions of the momentum variables and are related through time reversal symmetry : @xmath11 here , @xmath12 is the time reversal operator which acts on the spin degrees of freedom and is anti - linear .",
    "the choice of @xmath13 and @xmath14 is not unique .",
    "we further assume that @xmath10 can be chosen to be globally smooth .",
    "( see refs .   .",
    ")    for every value of @xmath15 , @xmath16 projects onto a complex vector space .",
    "we thus obtain a vector bundle over momentum space .",
    "the first chern number of this bundle , which we denote by @xmath17 can be written in the form @xcite , @xmath18    the first chern number vanishes for @xmath8 in topological insulators due to time reversal symmetry , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "however , it was shown that @xmath20 is a topological invariant @xcite and is independent of the choice of @xmath13 .",
    "consider the subset of gapped bloch hamiltonians which conserve the @xmath21 component of the spin , i.e. , hamiltonians in which there are no terms which turn up spins into down spins .",
    "the energy eigenstates can be decomposed into spin up and spin down bands .",
    "hamiltonians in this class with a bulk gap will always have a quantized spin hall conductance ( which could be zero ) .",
    "the @xmath0 topological classification tells us that hamiltonians of the even and the odd quantized spin hall effects are distinct even when we allow spin mixing terms in the hamiltonian . in terms of the spin chern number @xmath22 which can be defined for such models @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath0 invariant is @xmath23 .    in other words ,",
    "if we allow terms which cause spin mixing , the hamiltonians with an even spin hall effect can all be transformed into one another through adiabatic changes in parameter space and those with an odd spin hall effect can similarly be adiabatically transformed into one another .",
    "however , no member of the odd spin hall conductance class can be transformed into any member of the even spin hall conductance in a continuous way such that trs is protected and the system is gapped at all points of the transformation .",
    "further any general bloch hamiltonian ( with the same hilbert space and which has the same number of occupied bands ) which preserves time reversal symmetry may be adiabatically transformed to hamiltonians of precisely one of the two sets of hamiltonians without breaking trs at any intermediate point .",
    "the trivial and non - trivial topological classes may be thought of as equivalence classes of hamiltonians which contain respectively members which display an even and an odd quantized spin hall conductance .",
    "the brillouin zone for a 3d insulator has the topology of a three dimensional torus . we represent it by a cube @xmath24 . under the operation of the trs operator ,",
    "a bloch wave - function at the point @xmath15 gets mapped to the point @xmath25 .",
    "the plane in momentum space , @xmath26 gets mapped onto itself under inversion and has the topology of a 2d torus . the spectral projector , @xmath8 for the 3d insulator restricted to this plane , therefore has an associated @xmath0 invariant .",
    "there are a number of such surfaces with which one may associate a @xmath0 invariant .",
    "a few of these are the planes @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the associated @xmath0 invariants are denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 respectively .",
    "it was argued previously that the @xmath0 invariants of these planes are not all independent @xcite .",
    "the arguments were based on the counting of monopole charges @xcite , on contractions of the 3d ebz to the 3d torus @xcite , or on the number of independent choices of time reversal polarizations @xcite . here , we provide a simple alternate argument for the number of independent @xmath0 invariants in three dimensions .",
    "this argument also shows how the @xmath0 invariants of planes such as @xmath31 may be calculated from the other @xmath0 invariants .",
    "consider the composite surface , @xmath32 consisting of the shaded region in fig .  [ fig1](a ) .",
    "this surface , which is a union of the two planes , @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be mapped onto a two dimensional torus and is mapped onto itself under inversion .",
    "thus , a @xmath0 invariant may be associated with this surface .",
    "the projection operator for this surface can be written in terms of the two projection operators as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the projection operator restricted to the plane , @xmath37 and and @xmath38 is restricted to the plane @xmath33 . here , if @xmath39 , by @xmath40 , we mean @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath8 , @xmath36 and @xmath38 can be decomposed as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and corresponding @xmath0 invariants , @xmath42 defined .",
    "the projection operator , @xmath8 can be decomposed as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 etc .",
    "where we again assume that the decomposition is such that @xmath46 etc .",
    "are globally smooth on their domains of definition so that the corresponding chern numbers are well defined .",
    "consider now , a continuous deformation of the surface parameterized by a variable , @xmath49 , which varies from 0 to 1 such that at every point of the deformation , the surface @xmath50 gets mapped onto itself under inversion .",
    "@xmath51 corresponds to the surface previously denoted by s. a possible value of @xmath50 for @xmath52 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . at @xmath53 ,",
    "the surface @xmath50 becomes the surface shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) .",
    "this surface is the union of the planes @xmath54 and @xmath26 . under this transformation , the projection operator which becomes a continuous function of t",
    ", @xmath55 also changes continuously and the @xmath0 invariant therefore does not change .",
    "( note however , that we do not require that @xmath56 is a smooth function of t. )        the plane @xmath61 can also be obtained as a deformation of the surface in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) .",
    "thus the @xmath0 invariant of this plane is obtained as @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , by deforming surfaces @xmath63 which we define as the union of the planes @xmath64 and @xmath48 and @xmath65 which we define as the union of the planes @xmath66 and @xmath34 it can easily be shown that @xmath67    further , the @xmath0 invariant of any other plane which maps onto itself under trs can also be obtained from the values of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we can thus characterize any topological insulator with trs in three dimensions with four invariants , which may be chosen to be @xmath68 and @xmath70 .    the arguments in ref .",
    "may be summarized as follows .",
    "the spectral projection operator in 3d when restricted to the planes @xmath71 for @xmath72 can be written as a sum @xmath73 , where @xmath10 map onto each other under trs .",
    "consider the set of momentum space slices , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath76 be the restriction of the operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 to the plane @xmath79 .",
    "for an arbitrary value of @xmath80 , these operators do not map onto each other under trs .",
    "the @xmath81 invariant is therefore not well defined in general . when the @xmath0 invariants for the planes @xmath26",
    ", @xmath82 are different , the operators , @xmath83 and @xmath84 have different chern numbers .",
    "a continuous deformation of a two dimensional projection operator to one which has a different chern number is not possible .",
    "changes in chern number may be regarded as occurring at singular diabolical points or monopoles at which the projection operator is not well defined . in general , one may define 2d surfaces enclosing points at which the projection operators @xmath85 are not well defined and associate a charge with these surfaces .",
    "if the difference in chern number of @xmath13 on the slice @xmath26 to the chern number of @xmath13 on the slice @xmath34 is an odd integer , this implies the existence of a net odd monopole charge between these two planes and ensures that the @xmath0 invariants of the planes @xmath26 and @xmath34 are different . by a careful counting of monopole charges and by using trs , one can then show that in this case , the @xmath0 invariants of the @xmath66 and @xmath86 planes also differ from each other and the same is true for the @xmath33 and @xmath48 planes .",
    "this fourth @xmath0 invariant , @xmath87 is an intrinsically three dimensional characteristic of the insulator .",
    "insulators whose fourth @xmath0 invariant is zero and one have been christened `` weak '' and `` strong '' topological insulators respectively .",
    "the four invariants found here agree with the counting in refs .  .    in summary",
    ", we have analyzed the chern number formula for the @xmath0 invariant in two dimensions .",
    "the trivial and non - trivial topological classes may be thought of as equivalence classes of hamiltonians which contain respectively members with even and an odd quantized spin hall conductance .",
    "a simple counting argument for the number of invariants in 3d was provided using deformations of planes which map onto themselves under time reversal .",

    "<S> while in two dimensions , the analogy with the integer quantum hall effect leads to a simple picture for the topological phases and the @xmath0 invariant , in three dimensions , the picture is far more complicated . </S>",
    "<S> this is in part , due to the fact , that unlike the integer quantum hall effect , in 3d materials with unbroken trs , while three of the @xmath0 invariants are analogous to the 2d @xmath0 invariants , there is a fourth @xmath0 invariant which is intrinsically three dimensional .    </S>",
