    "it is caused by the difference in the origin of the strong phase in pqcd and qcd factorization .",
    "@xmath30 is one of the most important decay modes in the search for new physics . in this paper , we estimated mssm contribution in the @xmath0 decays using the pqcd approach . in pqcd , strong phases",
    "are calculable , and we can predict cp asymmetries . we considered the single mass insertions @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , and @xmath190 , and",
    "constrain them from @xmath191 .",
    "we found that the @xmath1 insertion may change the branching ratios and the cp asymmetries in @xmath30 significantly .",
    "the effect of the @xmath44 insertion is somewhat smaller than the @xmath1 insertion , and that of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 insertions is little .    in the case of the @xmath1 insertion",
    ", @xmath192 can reach about @xmath193 in both neutral and charged modes , and @xmath194 .",
    "the direct cp asymmetries arise from the interference between penguin amplitudes in the sm and chromomagnetic penguin amplitudes in the mssm . in pqcd",
    ", there is a large relative strong phase between them , so that the direct cp asymmetries may be large depending on the new physics parameters . as in figs .",
    "[ fig : phik_s](a ) or [ fig : phik_s_2000 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : phik_a](a ) indicate , our result is incompatible with the current belle data .",
    "however , the current belle result is not in agreement with the current babar result , so that we need more data to arrive at a definite conclusion .",
    "finally , it must be noted that the direct cp asymmetry in the neutral mode has the same tendency as one in the charged mode , because the chromomagnetic penguin contributions as well as the sm contributions are almost the same in both modes .",
