    "to identify the dynamical state of multi - planetary systems , we use the megno technique ( the acronym of mean exponential growth factor of nearby orbits ; cincotta & sim 2000 ) .",
    "this method provides relevant information about the global dynamics and the fine structure of the phase space , and yields simultaneously a good estimate of the lyapunov characteristic numbers with a comparatively small computational effort . from the megno technique",
    ", we have built the mips package ( acronym of megno indicator for planetary systems ) specially devoted to the study of planetary systems in their multi - dimensional space as well as their conditions of dynamical stability .",
    "particular planetary systems presented in this paper are only used as initial condition sources for theoretical studies of 3-body problems . by convention ,",
    "the reference system is given by the orbital plane of the inner planet at @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we suppose the orbital inclinations and the longitudes of node of the inner ( noted 1 ) and the outer ( noted 2 ) planets ( which are non - determined parameters from observations ) as follows : @xmath3 and @xmath4 in such a way that the relative inclination and the relative longitude of nodes are defined at @xmath5 as follows : @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the mips maps presented in this paper have been confirmed by a second global analysis technique ( marzari _ et al .",

    "studying conditions of dynamical stability in the neighborhood of the hd73526 two - planet system ( period ratio : 2/1 , see initial conditions in table 1 ) , we only find one stable and robust island ( noted ( 2 ) ) for a relative inclination of about @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) .",
    "such a relative inclination ( where in fact @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) may be considered to a coplanar system where the planet 2 has a retrograde motion with respect to the planet 1 . from a kinematic point of view , it amounts to consider a scale change of @xmath8 in relative inclinations . taking into account initial conditions inside the island ( 2 ) of fig . 1a , we show that the presence of a strong mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) induces clear stability zones with a nice v - shape structure , as shown in fig .",

    "even for very small semi - major axes and large planetary masses , which should a priori easily make a system unstable or chaotic , stability is possible with counter - revolving orbits .    in the case of the 2:1 retrograde resonance , although close approaches happen more often ( 3 for the 2:-1 mmr ) compared to the 2:1 prograde resonance , the 2:-1 mmr remains very efficient for stability because of faster close approaches between the planets .",
