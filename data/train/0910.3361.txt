    "the nature and origin of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) , especially above the so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) energy of @xmath3 50 eev ( 1 eev @xmath4 ev ) , has been one of most perplexing puzzles in astrophysics over five decades and still remains to be understood ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "the highest energy cr detected so far is the fly s eye event with an estimated energy of @xmath5 eev @xcite . at these high energies protons and nuclei can not be confined and accelerated effectively within our galaxy , so the sources of uhecrs are likely to be extragalactic .    at",
    "energies higher than @xmath6 , it is expected that protons lose energy and nuclei are photo - disintegrated via the interactions with the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) along their trajectories in the intergalactic space @xcite .",
    "the former is known as the gzk effect .",
    "so a significant suppression in the energy spectrum above @xmath6 could be regarded as an observational evidence for the extragalactic origin of uhecrs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the accurate measurement of the uhecr spectrum is very difficult , partly because of extremely low flux of uhecrs . but",
    "a more serious hurdle is the uncertainties in the energy calibration inherent in detecting and modeling extensive airshower events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nevertheless , both the yakutsk extensive air shower array ( yakutsk ) and the high resolution fly s eyes ( hires ) reported observations of the gzk suppression @xcite , while the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) claimed a conflicting finding of no suppression @xcite .",
    "more recent data from the pierre auger observatory ( auger ) support the existence of the gzk suppression @xcite . below @xmath6 , however , the four experiments reported the fluxes that are different from each other by up to a factor of several , implying the possible existence of systematic errors in their energy calibrations @xcite .    the overall sky distribution of the arrival directions of uhecrs below @xmath7 seems to support the isotropy hypothesis ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is consistent with the expectation of uniform distribution of extragalactic sources ; the interaction length ( i.e. horizon distance ) of protons below @xmath7 is a few gpc and the universe can be considered homogeneous and isotropic on such a large scale .",
    "the horizon distance for super - gzk events , however , decreases sharply with energy and @xmath8 mpc for @xmath9eev @xcite .",
    "the matter distribution inside the local gzk horizon ( @xmath10 ) is inhomogeneous . since",
    "powerful astronomical objects are likely to form at deep gravitational potential wells , we expect the distribution of the uhecr sources would be inhomogeneous as well .",
    "hence , if super - gzk proton events point their sources , their arrival directions should be anisotropic .",
    "the anisotropy of super - gzk events , hence , has been regarded to provide an important clue that unveils the sources of uhecrs .",
    "so far , however , the claims derived from analyses of different experiments are often tantalizing and sometimes conflicting . for instance , with an excessive number of pairs and one triplet in the arrival direction of crs above 40 eev , the agasa data support the existence of small scale clustering @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the hires stereo data are consistent with the hypothesis of null clustering @xcite .",
    "the auto - correlation analysis of the auger data reported a weak excess of pairs for @xmath11 eev @xcite .",
    "in addition , the auger collaboration found a correlation between highest energy events and the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe using nearby active galactic nuclei ( agns ) in the @xcite catalog @xcite as well as using nearby objects in different catalogs @xcite . a correlation between highest agasa events with nearby galaxies from sdss",
    "was reported @xcite .",
    "the hires data , however , do not show such correlation of highest energy events with nearby agns @xcite , but instead show a correlation with distant bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of anisotropy and correlation analyses is , however , complicated owing to the intervening galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) and intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) ; the trajectories of uhecrs are deflected by the magnetic fields as they propagate through the space between sources and us , and hence , their arrival directions are altered .",
    "even with considerable observational and theoretical efforts , however , the nature of the gmf and the igmf is still poorly constrained .",
    "yet , models for the gmf generally assume a strength of @xmath12 a few @xmath13 g and a coherence length of @xmath14 kpc for the field in the galactic halo ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and predict the deflection of uhe protons due to the gmf to be @xmath15 a few degrees ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the situation for the igmf in the lss has been confusing . adopting a model for the igmf with the average strength of @xmath16 ng in filaments",
    ", @xcite showed that the deflection of uhecrs due to the igmf could be very large , e.g. , @xmath17 for protons above 100 eev . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite adopted a model with @xmath18 ng in filaments and showed that the deflection should be negligible , e.g. , @xmath19 for protons with 100 eev .",
    "recently , @xcite proposed a physically motivated model for the igmf , in which a part of the gravitational energy released during structure formation is transferred to the magnetic field energy as a result of the turbulent dynamo amplification of weak seed fields in the lss of the universe . in the model ,",
    "the igmf follows largely the matter distribution in the cosmic web , and the strength and coherence length are predicted to be @xmath20 ng and @xmath14 mpc for the field in filaments . such field in filaments",
    "is expected to induce the faraday rotation @xcite , which is consistent with observation @xcite . with",
    "this model igmf , @xcite ( paper i hereafter ) calculated the trajectories of uhe protons ( @xmath21 eev ) that were injected at extragalactic sources associated with the lss in a simulated model universe .",
    "we then estimated that only @xmath22 % of uhe protons above 60 eev would arrive at us with @xmath23 and the average value of deflection angle would be @xmath0 .",
    "note that the deflection angle of @xmath0 is much larger than the angular window of @xmath24 used by the auger collaboration in the study of the correlation between highest energy uhecr events and nearby agns @xcite .    in this contribution , as a follow - up work of paper i , we investigate the effects of the igmf on the arrival direction of super - gzk protons above 60 eev coming from sources within 75 mpc .",
    "the limiting parameters for energy and source distance are chosen to match the recent analysis of the auger collaboration . without knowing the true sources of uhecrs , the statistics that can be obtained with observational data from experiments are limited ; some statistics that are essential to reveal the nature of sources are difficult or even impossible to be constructed . on the other hand , with data from simulations ,",
    "any statistics can be explored . in that sense , simulations complement experiments . here , with the igmf suggested by @xcite , we argue that the large deflection angle of super - gzk protons due to the igmf is not inconsistent with the anisotropy and correlation recently reported by the auger collaboration .",
    "however , the large deflection angle implies that the nearest object to a uhecr event in the sky is not necessarily its actual source . in section 2",
    ", we describe our models for the lss of the universe , igmf , observers , and sources of uhecrs , reference objects for correlation study , and simulations . in section 3",
    ", we present the results , followed by a summary and discussion in section 4 .",
    "in our study , the following elements are necessary : 1 ) a model for the igmf on the lss , 2 ) a set of virtual observers that represent `` us '' , an observer at the earth , in a statistical way , 3 ) a set of hypothetical sources of uhe protons with a specified injection spectrum , and 4 ) a set of reference objects with which we performed a correlation study of simulated events . in paper",
    "i , we described in detail how we set up 1 ) , 2 ) , and 3 ) by using data from cosmological structure formation simulations .",
    "below , we briefly summarize models for 1 ) , 2 ) , and 3 ) and explain in details the reason to introduce `` reference objects '' in this study .",
    "we assumed a concordance @xmath25cdm model with the following parameters : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29/(100 km / s / mpc ) = 0.7 , and @xmath30 .",
    "the model universe for the lss was generated through simulations in a cubic region of comoving size @xmath31 mpc with @xmath32 grid zones for gas and gravity and @xmath33 particles for dark matter , using a pm / eulerian hydrodynamic cosmology code described in @xcite .",
    "the simulations have a uniform spatial resolution of @xmath34 kpc .",
    "the standard set of gasdynamic variables , the gas density , @xmath35 , temperature , @xmath36 , and the flow velocity , @xmath37 , were used to calculate the quantities required in our model such as the x - ray emission weighted temperature @xmath38 , the vorticity , @xmath39 , and the turbulent energy density , @xmath40 , at each grid .",
    "we adopted the igmf from the model by @xcite ; the model proposes that turbulent - flow motions are induced via the cascade of the vorticity generated at cosmological shocks during the formation of the lss of the universe , and the igmf is produced as a consequence of the amplification of weak seed fields of any origin by the turbulence .",
    "then , the energy density ( or the strength ) of the igmf can be estimated with the eddy turnover number and the turbulent energy density as follow : @xmath41 here , the eddy turnover time is defined as the reciprocal of the vorticity at driving scales , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , and @xmath44 is the conversion factor from turbulent to magnetic energy that depends on the eddy turnover number @xmath45 .",
    "the eddy turnover number was estimated as the age of universe times the magnitude of the local vorticity , that is , @xmath46 .",
    "the local vorticity and turbulent energy density were calculated from cosmological simulations for structure formation described above .",
    "a functional form for the conversion factor was derived from a separate , incompressible , magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulation of turbulence dynamo .    for the direction of the igmf",
    ", we used that of the passive fields from cosmological simulations , in which magnetic fields were generated through the biermann battery mechanism @xcite at cosmological shocks and evolved passively along with flow motions @xcite . in principle , if we had performed full mhd simulations , we could have followed the amplification of the igmf through turbulence dynamo . in practice , however , the currently available computational resources do not allow a numerical resolution high enough to reproduce the full development of mhd turbulence .",
    "since the numerical resistivity is larger than the physical resistivity by many orders of magnitude , the growth of magnetic fields is saturated before dynamo action becomes fully operative ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this is the reason why we adopted the model of @xcite to estimate the strength of the igmf , but we still used the the passive fields from cosmological simulations to model the field direction .",
    "figure 1 shows the distribution of magnetic field strength in a slice of ( 143 mpc)@xmath47 in our model universe .",
    "it shows that the igmf is structured like the matter in the cosmic web . as a matter of fact",
    ", the distribution of the igmf is very well correlated with that of matter .",
    "the strongest magnetic field of @xmath48 g is found in and around clusters , while the field is weaker in filaments , sheets , and voids . in filaments",
    "which are mostly composed of the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) with @xmath49 k , the igmf has @xmath50 ng and @xmath51 a few @xmath52 ng @xcite .",
    "note that the deflection of uhecrs arises mostly due to the field in filaments ( see paper i ) .",
    "the energy density of the igmf in filaments is @xmath53 ergs @xmath54 , which is a few times smaller than the gas thermal energy density and an order of magnitude smaller than the gas kinetic energy density there .",
    "the igmf in filaments induces the faraday rotation ; the root - mean - square ( rms ) value of rotation measure ( rm ) is predicted to be a few rad m@xmath55 @xcite .",
    "that is consistent with the values of rm toward the hercules and perseus - pisces superclusters reported in @xcite.rm@xmath56 in @xcite is an order of magnitude larger than the value above , a few rad m@xmath55 .",
    "however , @xcite quoted the path length , which is about two orders of magnitude larger . ]      in the study of the arrival direction of uhecrs , the igmf around us , that is , in the local group , is important too .",
    "it would have been ideal to place `` the observer '' where the igmf is similar to that in the local group .",
    "unfortunately , however , little is known about the igmf in the local group .",
    "hence , instead , we placed `` virtual '' observers based on the x - ray emission weighted temperature @xmath38 .",
    "the groups of galaxies that have the halo temperature similar to that of the local group , 0.05 kev @xmath57 0.5 kev @xcite , were identified .",
    "about 1400 observer locations were chosen by the temperature criterion . in reality , there should be only one observer on the earth .",
    "but in our modeling we could choose a number of observer locations to represent statistically `` us '' without loss of generality , since the simulated universe is only one statistical representation of the real universe .",
    "then , we modeled observers as a sphere of radius @xmath58 mpc located at the center of host groups , in order to reduce the computing time to a practical level .",
    "the distribution of handful observers are shown schematically in figure 1 .",
    "one can see that the observers ( groups ) are not distributed uniformly , but instead they are located mostly along filaments .      as noted in introduction ,",
    "the auger collaboration recently reported a correlation between the direction of their highest energy events and the sky position of nearby agns from the 12th edition of the @xcite ( vcv ) catalog ; the correlation has the maximum significance for uhecrs with @xmath59 eev and agns with distance @xmath60 mpc @xcite .",
    "there are about 450 agns with @xmath60 mpc ( more precisely , 442 agns with redshift @xmath61 , for which the maximum significance of the correlation was found ) in the vcv catalog . in that study",
    "it is not known which subclass of those agns or what fraction of them are really true sources of uhecrs . here ,",
    "we regard those agns as `` reference objects '' , with which correlation studies are performed .    in order to compare our correlation study with that of the auger collaboration",
    ", we specified the following condition to determine `` model '' reference objects in the simulated universe : 1 ) the number of the objects within 75 mpc from each observer should be on average @xmath62 , and 2 ) their spatial distribution should trace the lss in a way similar to the agn distribution in the real universe .",
    "to set up the location of such reference objects , we identified `` clusters '' of galaxies with @xmath63 kev in the simulated universe .",
    "of course some of these clusters with @xmath64 a few kev should be classified as groups of galaxies .",
    "but for simplicity we call all of them as clusters .",
    "the reason behind this selection condition is that the gas temperature is directly related with the depth of gravitational potential well ; the hottest gas resides in the densest , most nonlinear regions of the lss where the most luminous and energetic objects ( e.g. agns ) form through frequent mergers of galaxies .",
    "we then assumed that each cluster hosts one reference object at its center .",
    "for each observer , we generated a list of reference objects inside a sphere of radius 75 mpc , whose number is on average @xmath62 ; the exact number of reference objects varies somewhat for different observers .",
    "then , each observer has its own sky distribution of reference objects , with which we studied the correlation of simulated events .",
    "although our reference objects could be any astronomical objects that trace the lss , hereafter we refer them as `` model agns '' , because the selection criteria were chosen to match the number of agns with that from the vcv catalog .",
    "figure 1 shows the schematic distribution of handful model agns at the center of host clusters .",
    "obviously the host clusters ( and the agns ) are not uniformly distributed either .    in our set - up , the distance to the model agns , @xmath65 ,",
    "can be arbitrarily small .",
    "in reality , however , the closest agn in the vcv catalog is ngc 404 at @xmath66 mpc in the constellation andromeda @xcite .",
    "so the model agns with the distance from each observer @xmath67 mpc were excluded .",
    "we checked the angular distance @xmath68 between a given reference object to its nearest neighboring object .",
    "for a set of 442 objects ( the number of the agns with @xmath61 in the vcv catalog ) , if they are distributed isotropically over the sky of @xmath69 radian , the average value of @xmath68 would be @xmath70 . with the 442 agns from the vcv catalog , on the other hand , @xmath71 .",
    "the fact that @xmath72 means that the distribution of the agns from the vcv catalog is not isotropic , but highly clustered , following the matter distribution in the lss of the universe .",
    "we note that @xmath71 is similar to the angular window of @xmath24 used in the auger study . clearly",
    "this agreement is not accidental , but rather consequential .",
    "for the sets of @xmath62 model agns in our simulations , the average angular distance is @xmath73 .",
    "the error was estimated with @xmath74 for @xmath75 observers .",
    "that fact that @xmath76 indicates that the spatial clustering of our model agns is on average comparable to that of the agns from the vcv catalog .",
    "this provides a justification for our selection criteria for model agns in the simulated universe .",
    "we note that @xmath68 is an intrinsic property of the distribution of the reference objects in the sky and has nothing to do with uhecrs .",
    "although agn is one of viable candidates that would produce uhecrs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for the list of viable candidates ) , there is no compelling reason that all the nearby agns are the sources of uhecrs . in this paper",
    ", we considered three models with different numbers of sources , @xmath77 ( see table 1 ) , to represent different subsets of agns .",
    "1 ) among agns , radio galaxies are considered to be the most promising sources of uhecrs ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and there are 28 known radio galaxies within @xmath78 mpc .",
    "so in model c , we considered on average 28 model agns located at 28 hottest host clusters ( @xmath79kev ) within a sphere of radius 75 mpc as true sources of uhecrs .",
    "2 ) based on the ratio of singlet to doublet events , on the other hand , @xcite argued that the lower limit on the number of sources of uhecrs would be around 61 .",
    "following this claim , in model b , we regarded on average 60 model agns located at 60 hottest host clusters ( @xmath80kev ) as true sources of uhecrs .",
    "2 ) in model a , we regarded all the model agns ( reference objects ) as true sources of uhecrs .    ccccccccc a & @xmath12500 & @xmath81 0.1kev & 13.98 & 7.01 & 3.58 & 2.80 + b & 60 & @xmath81 0.55kev & 15.33 & 8.80 & 3.97 & 3.19 + c & 28 & @xmath81 0.8kev & 17.76 & 10.45 & 4.23 & 3.43 +      at sources , uhe protons were injected with power - law energy spectrum ; @xmath82 for @xmath83 ev @xmath84 ev , where @xmath85 is the injection spectral index .",
    "we considered the two cases of @xmath86 and 2.4 . at each source , protons were randomly distributed over a sphere of radius @xmath58 mpc , and then launched in random directions .",
    "we then followed the trajectories of uhe protons in our model universe with the igmf , by numerically integrating the equations of motion ; @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the momentum .",
    "during propagation uhe protons interact with the cmb , and the dominant processes for energy loss are the pion and pair productions . the energy loss was treated with the continuous - loss approximation @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic loss due to the cosmic expansion was ignored .",
    "we let uhe protons continue the journey , visiting several observers during flight , until the energy falls to 60 eev .",
    "at observers , the events with @xmath89 eev were recorded and analyzed .",
    "in paper i , we considered the deflection angle , @xmath90 , between the arrival direction of uhecr events and the sky position of their sources ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "obviously this angle can be calculated only when the true sources are known , which is not the case in experiments . in the simulated universe ,",
    "our model agns and observers are located in strongly magnetized regions . as illustrated in figure 1 ,",
    "uhecrs first have to escape from magnetic halos surrounding sources , then travel through more or less void regions ( path 1 ) or through filaments ( path 2 ) , and finally penetrate into magnetic halos around observers , to reach observers .",
    "so the degree of deflection depends not only on the magnetic field along trajectories but also on the fields at host clusters and groups of sources and observers . since the gas temperature",
    ", the depth of gravitational potential well , and the magnetic field energy density are related as @xmath91 in our model , hotter clusters and groups would have stronger fields .",
    "so we expect that if sources and observers are located at hotter hosts , @xmath90 would be larger on average .",
    "figure 3 shows @xmath90 versus @xmath92 for uhe proton events recorded at observers in our simulations . here",
    ", @xmath92 denotes the distance to the actual sources of events .",
    "the top , middle , and bottom panels are for models a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "only the case of injection spectral index @xmath86 is presented .",
    "the case of @xmath93 is similar .",
    "each dot represents one simulated event , and there are about @xmath94 events in each model .",
    "the upper circles connected with dotted lines represent the mean values of @xmath90 in the distance bins of @xmath95 $ ] .",
    "the mean deflection angle averaged over all the simulated events is @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 for @xmath86 in model a , model b , and model c , respectively .",
    "the lower circles connected with solid lines represent the median values of @xmath90 .",
    "the median value for all the simulated events is @xmath99 , @xmath100 , and @xmath101 for @xmath86 in model a , model b , and model c , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath102 and @xmath103 for @xmath93 are similar .",
    "the marks connected with vertical solid lines on the both sides of median values are the first and third quartiles in the distance bins , which provide a measure of the dispersion of @xmath90 .",
    "we note the following points .",
    "( 1 ) with our igmf , the mean deflection angle of uhe protons due to the igmf is quite large , much larger than the angular window of @xmath24 used in the auger correlation study .",
    "it is also much larger than the mean deflection angle that is expected to result from the galactic magnetic field , which is a few degrees @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the mean deflection angle is largest in model c and smallest in model a. recall that in model c sources are located only at 28 hottest clusters , while in model a all 500 clusters include sources ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the uhecr events from hotter clusters tend to experience more deflection , as noted above .",
    "so the mean of deflection angles in the model with hotter host clusters is larger .",
    "( 3 ) the mean value of @xmath90 has a minimum at @xmath104 mpc , which compares to a typical length of filaments . as we pointed out in paper i , this is a consequence of the structured magnetic fields that are concentrated along filaments and at clusters . in an event with @xmath105 ,",
    "the source and observer are more likely to belong to the same filament , and so the particle is more likely to travel through strongly magnetized regions and suffer large deflection ( see the path 2 in figure 1 ) . in the opposite regime ,",
    "the source and observer are likely to belong to different filaments , so the particle would travel through void regions ( see the path 1 in figure 1 ) .",
    "( 4 ) for the events with @xmath106 , the mean and dispersion of @xmath90 increase with @xmath107 .",
    "such trend is expected , since in the diffusive transport model of the propagation of uhecrs , the deflection angle increases with distance as @xmath108 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "( 5 ) there are more events from nearby sources than from distant sources , although all the sources inject the same number of uhecrs in our model",
    ". the smaller number of events for larger @xmath107 should be mostly a consequence of energy loss due to the interaction with the cmb .      in this study",
    ", we also consider the separation angle , @xmath109 , between the arrival direction of uhecr events and the sky position of nearest reference objects ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the angle can be calculated with observation data , once a class of reference objects ( e.g. agns , galaxies gamma - ray bursts , and etc . )",
    "is specified .",
    "for example , @xcite took the agns within 75 mpc in the vcv catalog as the reference objects for their correlation study .",
    "however , for a given uhecr event , the nearest agn in the sky may not be the actual source ; hence , the separation angle between a uhecr event and its nearest agn is not necessarily the same as the deflection angle of the event @xcite .",
    "we obtained @xmath109 for simulated events with our model reference objects ( agns ) .",
    "figure 4 shows @xmath109 versus @xmath110 .",
    "here , @xmath110 denotes the distance to nearest agns . again only the case of @xmath86 is presented , and the case of @xmath93 is similar ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the circles connected with solid line represent the mean values of @xmath109 for the events with nearest agns in the distance bins of @xmath111 $ ] .",
    "the mean separation angle averaged over all the simulated events is @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 for @xmath86 in models a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "we note the following points .",
    "( 1 ) the mean separation angle is much smaller than the mean deflection angle , @xmath115 ( see the next section for further discussion ) .",
    "( 2 ) the mean separation angle is largest in model c and smallest in model a , although the difference of @xmath116 among the models is less than that of @xmath102 . with larger deflection angles in model c , there is a higher probability for a event to be found further away from the region where model agns are clustered , so @xmath109 is on average larger as well .",
    "( 3 ) similarly as in the @xmath90 versus @xmath92 distribution , the distribution of @xmath116 has the minimum at around @xmath117 mpc .",
    "this is again a signature of the filamentary structures of the lss .",
    "( 4 ) contrary to @xmath92 , there are more events with larger @xmath110 than with smaller @xmath110 .",
    "it is simply because there are more agns with larger @xmath110 .",
    "we also obtained @xmath109 for the 27 auger events of highest energies , published in @xcite , with 442 nearby agns from the vc catalog . in figure 5",
    ", we compare the @xmath109 versus @xmath118 distribution for the auger data with that of our simulations .",
    "the upper circles connected with dashed / dot - dashed lines represent the mean values of @xmath119 of simulated events as in figure 4 , but this time both cases of @xmath86 and 2.4 are presented .",
    "the lower circles connected with solid / dotted lines represent the median values of @xmath119 .",
    "the difference between the cases of @xmath86 and 2.4 is indeed small .",
    "the median value of @xmath119 for all the simulated events is @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 for @xmath86 in models a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "asterisks denote the auger events .",
    "the mean separation angle for the auger events is @xmath123 for 26 events , excluding one event with large @xmath109 ( @xmath124 ) , while @xmath125 for all the 27 events .",
    "we note that @xmath126 , even though the mean deflection angle is much larger than the mean separation angle in our simulations , that is , @xmath127 . in all the models , about a half of the auger events lie within the quartile marks : 15 , 13 , and 13 events for models a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "with @xmath0 in our simulations , one might naively expect that such large deflection would erase the anisotropy in the arrival direction and the correlation between uhecr events and agns ( or the lss of the universe ) .",
    "however , we argue that the large deflection does not necessarily lead to the general isotropy of uhecr arrival direction , if the agent of deflection , the igmf , traces the local lss .",
    "suppose that uhecrs are ejected from sources inside the local supercluster .",
    "some of them will fly along the supergalactic plane and arrive at the earth ; their trajectories would be deflected by the magnetic field between sources and us , but the arrival directions still point toward the supergalactic plane .",
    "others may be deflected into void regions , and then they will have less chance to get reflected back to the direction toward us due to lack of the turbulent igmf there . in a simplified picture , we may regard the irregularities in the igmf as the ` scatters ' of uhecrs ; then the last scattering point will be the arrival direction of uhecrs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a description of deflection of uhecrs based on this picture ) .",
    "as a result , even with large deflection , we still see more uhecrs from the lss of clusters , groups , and filaments , and fewer uhecrs from void regions where both sources and scatters are underpopulated .",
    "consequently , the anisotropy in the arrival direction of uhecrs can be maintained and the arrival direction still follows the lss of the universe .    below the gzk energy ,",
    "the proton horizon reaches out to a few gpc , so the source distribution should look more or less isotropic and the arrival directions should not show a correlation with nearby agns .",
    "thus , we do not expect to see anisotropy and correlation for uhecrs with such energy .    in section 2.4",
    ", we showed that the degree of clustering of our model agns is similar to that of agns from the vcv catalog ; the mean of the angular distance @xmath68 between a given agn to its nearest neighboring agn is similar , @xmath128 . in both cases ,",
    "agns follow the matter distribution in the lss , highly structured and clustered .",
    "we point that if along with the reference objects , the cr sources and the igmf also follow the matter distribution , with @xmath129 , @xmath130 is expected .",
    "the result that @xmath126 @xmath131 is indeed consistent with such expectation .",
    "this means , however , that the statistics of @xmath109 reflect mainly on the distribution of reference objects , rather than the deflection angle .    to further compare the auger data with our simulations , we plot the cumulative fraction of events , @xmath132 , versus @xmath133 for the simulated events ( lines ) and the auger events ( open circles ) in figure 6 .",
    "the solid and dotted lines are for the cases of @xmath86 and 2.4 , respectively , and the difference between the two cases is again small .",
    "the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test yields the maximum difference of @xmath134 , 0.23 , and 0.26 between the auger data and the simulation data ( @xmath86 ) in models a , b , and c , respectively ; the significance level of the null hypothesis that the two distributions are statistically identical is @xmath135 , 0.09 , and 0.04 for models a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "so the null hypothesis that the two distributions for our simulated events and the auger events are statistically identical can not be rejected , especially for model a. this would be a justification for our models of the igmf , sources of uhecrs , and reference objects . also we see that model a with more sources is preferred over models b and c with fewer sources . but",
    "this does not necessary mean that all the agns would be the actual sources of uhecrs .",
    "we note that the number of the auger events used , 27 , is still limited .",
    "in addition , we consider only uhe protons in this paper .",
    "hence , before we argue the above statements for sure , we will need more observational events and need to know the composition of uhecrs ( see summary and discussion for further discussion on composition ) .",
    "with @xmath127 , there is a good chance that the agns found closest to the direction of uhecrs are not the actual sources of uhecrs . to illustrate this point ,",
    "we first show the distribution of @xmath110 versus @xmath92 in figure 7 . for some events ,",
    "the closest agns are the actual sources .",
    "they are represented by the diagonal line . around the diagonal line , a noticeable fraction of events are found .",
    "those are the events for which the closest agns are found around the true sources ; both sources and close - by agns are clustered as a part of the lss of the universe . for the events away from the diagonal line , it is more likely that @xmath136 .",
    "it is because there are more agns with larger @xmath110 ; away from true sources , observed events are more likely to pick up closest agns with larger @xmath110 .    to quantify the consequence of @xmath127",
    ", we calculated the fraction of true identification , @xmath137 , as the ratio of the number of events for which nearest agns are their true sources to the total number of simulated events .",
    "this is a measure of the probability to find the true sources of uhecrs , when nearest candidates are blindly chosen ( which is the best we can do with observed data ) . in figure 8 , we show the fraction as a function of separation angle , @xmath109 .",
    "the fraction is largest in model a with largest @xmath77 , and smallest in model c with smallest @xmath77 . at @xmath138",
    "the fraction is about 50 % for model a , close to 40 % for model b , and a little above 30 % for model c , but only @xmath139 % at @xmath140 . as the separation angle increases ,",
    "the fraction decreases gradually to @xmath141 % , indicating lower probabilities to find true sources at larger separation angles . on average",
    ", we should expect that in less than 1 out of 3 events , the true sources of uhecrs can be identified , if our model for the igmf is valid and uhecrs are protons .",
    "in the search for the nature and origin of uhecrs , understanding the propagation of charged particles through the magnetized lss of the universe is important . at present , the details of the igmf are still uncertain , mainly due to limited available information from observation . here",
    ", we adopted a realistic model universe that was described by simulations of cosmological structure formation ; our simulated universe represents the lss , which is dominated by the cosmic web of filaments interconnecting clusters and groups .",
    "the distribution of the igmf in the lss of the universe was obtained with a physically motivated model based on turbulence dynamo @xcite .    to investigate the effects of the igmf on the arrival direction of uhecrs",
    ", we further adopted the following models .",
    "virtual observers of about 1400 were placed at groups of galaxies , which represent statistically the local group in the simulated model universe .",
    "then , we set up a set of about 500 agn - like `` reference objects '' within 75 mpc from each observer , at clusters of galaxies ( deep gravitational potential wells ) along the lss .",
    "they represent a class of astronomical objects with which we performed a correlation analysis for simulated uhecr events .",
    "we considered three models , in which subsets of the reference objects were selected as agn - like sources of uhecrs ( see table 1 ) .",
    "uhe protons of @xmath89 eev with power - low energy spectrum were injected at those sources , and the trajectories of uhe protons in the magnetized cosmic web were followed . at observer locations , the events with @xmath89 eev from sources within a sphere of radius 75 mpc were recorded and analyzed .    to characterize the clustering of the reference objects",
    ", we calculated the angular distance , @xmath68 , from a given reference object to its nearest neighbor .",
    "the mean value for our model agns in the simulated universe is @xmath73 , while that for 442 agns from the vcv catalog is @xmath71 .",
    "this demonstrates that the two samples have a similar degree of clustering and are highly structured ( e.g. @xmath142 for the isotropic distribution ) .    with our model igmf ,",
    "the deflection angle , @xmath90 , between the arrival direction of uhe protons and the sky position of their actual sources , is quite large with the mean @xmath143 and the median @xmath1 , depending on models with different numbers of sources ( see table 1 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the separation angle between the arrival direction and the sky position of nearest reference objects is substantially smaller with the mean @xmath144 and the median @xmath145 .",
    "that is , we found that while @xmath146 , @xmath116 is similar to @xmath74 . for the auger events of highest energies in @xcite , with 442 nearby agns from the vcv catalog as the reference objects ,",
    "the mean separation angle is @xmath123 for the 26 events , excluding one event with large @xmath109 ( @xmath147 ) , while @xmath125 for all the 27 events .",
    "hence , @xmath148 @xmath149 .",
    "this implies that the separation angle from the auger data would be determined primarily by the distribution of reference objects ( agns ) , and may not represent the true deflection angle .",
    "we further tested whether the distributions of separation angle , @xmath109 , for our simulated events and for the auger events are statistically comparable to each other . according the kolmogorov - smirnov test for the cumulative fraction of events , @xmath132 , versus @xmath133 , the significance level of the null hypothesis that the two distributions are drawn from the identical population is as large as @xmath135 for model a ( see table 1 ) .",
    "thus , we argued that our simulation data , especially in model a , are in a fair agreement with the auger data .",
    "this test also showed that the model with more sources ( model a ) is preferred over the models with fewer sources ( models b and c ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath127 implies that the agns found closest to the direction of uhecrs may not be the true sources of uhecrs .",
    "we estimated the probability of finding the true sources of uhecrs , when nearest reference objects are blindly chosen : @xmath150 is the ratio of the number of true source identifications to the total number of simulated events .",
    "this probability is @xmath151 % at @xmath138 , but decreases to @xmath141 % at larger separation angle . on average , in less than 1 out of 3 events , the true sources of uhecrs can be identified in our simulations , when nearest reference objects are chosen .    the distribution of @xmath90 versus @xmath92 shows a bimodal pattern in which @xmath90 is on average larger either for nearby sources ( for @xmath152 mpc ) or for distant sources ( for @xmath153 mpc ) with the minimum at the intermediate distance of @xmath104 mpc .",
    "the distribution of @xmath109 versus @xmath118 shows a similar , but weaker sign of the bimodal pattern .",
    "this behavior is a characteristic signature of the magnetized cosmic web of the universe , where filaments are the most dominant structure . when a large number of super - gzk events are accumulated , we may find the signature of the cosmic web of filaments in the @xmath109 versus @xmath118 distribution .    finally , we address the limitations of our work .",
    "( 1 ) we worked in a simulated universe with specific models for the elements such as the igmf , observers , sources , and reference objects , but not in the real universe .",
    "so we could make only statistical statements .",
    "( 2 ) it has been shown previously that adopting different models for the igmf , very different deflection angles are obtained ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we argue that our model for the igmf is most plausible , since it is a physically motivated model based on turbulence dynamo without involving an arbitrary normalization @xcite . nevertheless , our igmf model should be confirmed further by observation .",
    "( 3 ) the sources of uhecrs may not be objects like agns , but could be objects extinguished a while ago , such as gamma - ray bursts ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or sources spread over space like cosmological shocks ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the injection energy spectrum of power - law with cut - off at an arbitrary maximum energy ( see section 2.6 ) would be unrealistic .",
    "the igmf in the local group ( see paper i ) , although currently little is known , might be strong enough to substantially deflect the trajectories of uhecrs .",
    "all of those will have effects on the quantitative results , which should be investigated further .",
    "( 4 ) recently , the auger collaboration disclosed the analysis , which suggests a substantial fraction of highest energy uhecrs might be iron nuclei @xcite .",
    "this is in contradiction with the analysis of the hires data , which indicates highest energy uhecrs would be mostly protons @xcite .",
    "the issue of composition still needs to be settled down among experiments .",
    "iron nuclei , on the way from sources to us , suffer much larger deflection than protons .",
    "hence , if a substantial fraction of uhecrs is iron , some of our findings will change , a question which should be investigated in the future .",
