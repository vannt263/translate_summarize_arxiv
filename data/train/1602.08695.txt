    "plasticity of crystalline solids involves the notion of dislocations . however ,",
    "even today , conventional plasticity theories use mesoscopic variables and evolution equations that do not involve dislocations .",
    "this paradoxical situation is due to the enormous length and time scales that separate the description of plasticity at the level of individual dislocations and the macroscopic scale of engineering materials .",
    "this huge space and time separation renders the hope to use a discrete dislocation based approach out of reach for treating engineering problems .",
    "it could be argued that conventional or phenomenological plasticity theories are justified because , at the macroscopic scale , engineering materials always display some sort of disorder that gives to any macroscopic property or measure an inevitable averaging character .",
    "hence , at macroscale , plastic strain may be seen as resulting from a space and time average over a huge number of individual dislocation glide events .",
    "nevertheless , conventional plasticity theories rely on strong approximations and on phenomenological laws that must be calibrated for each material or for each specific applications . therefore , it is desirable to make a link between the micro and macro scales and to develop a mesoscopic plasticity theory that relies on a sound physical basis , i.e. that at least incorporates dislocation glide .",
    "the development of such a mesoscale theory is also crucial to better understand and simulate the materials behavior at length scales where the elastic interaction between dislocations becomes of the order of the interaction between dislocations and obstacles , such as precipitates in a matrix , small grains in a polycrystal or interfaces in nano - materials . at these scales ,",
    "dislocations display collective phenomena that result in patterning and complex dynamic regimes . in these situations ,",
    "plasticity can not be described by a simple averaged plastic strain that obeys local time - dependent equations .",
    "size - dependent effects and , most importantly , transport become fondamental .",
    "conventional theories of plasticity are no longer valid and are unable to account for the complexity of the plastic activity because they lack the relevant internal length scale and do not incorporate transport .",
    "these considerations motivate the development of continuum models in which dislocations are represented by continuous densities and in which the dynamics has conserved the transport character of the underlying dislocation glide .",
    "continuum dislocation representations often start from the nye @xcite and krner @xcite representation of dislocations .",
    "this is the case of the field dislocation model ( fdm ) proposed by acharya @xcite and developed subsequently by various authors @xcite .",
    "the basic equations have been in fact known as early as the @xmath0 s @xcite ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "the basic ingredient of the fdm is the dislocation density tensor @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the plastic distorsion tensor .",
    "when envisaged at the smallest scale , the tensor @xmath3 represents all the dislocations and there is no need to introduce the concept of `` geometrically necessary '' or `` statistically stored '' dislocations ( gnd and ssd , respectively ) .",
    "the model is then exact , regardless of the atomic nature of the dislocations and provided that we accept that the dislocation velocity is simply proportional to the local resolved shear stress .",
    "however , being continuous by nature , the implementation of the model requires the use of a computational grid with a grid step significantly smaller than the burgers vector length .",
    "this drastically limits the spatial length scale that can be investigated .",
    "therefore , in order to reach a convenient macro scale , a change of scale must be performed to bridge the gap between the singular density tensor introduced above and a continuous one defined at an intermediate scale .",
    "there is of course no unique way to select this so - called `` mesoscale '' .",
    "obviously , the mesoscale must be larger than the average distance between dislocations and smaller than the characteristic length scale we want to investigate ( average grain size in polycrystals , average distance between interfaces in multiphase alloys , etc . ) .",
    "the underlying averaging or `` coarse - graining '' procedure has of course been already mentioned in the context of the fdm @xcite .",
    "the crucial point is that the application of the coarse - graining procedure to the fdm equations leads to transport equations for the averaged one - body gnd density in which the plastic strain rate inevitably depends on the correlations between the lower scale gnd and velocity fields .",
    "this closure problem is often resolved by using a phenomenological velocity law borrowed from macroscopic plasticity models leading to the so - called phenomenological mesoscopic field dislocation model ( pmfdm ) @xcite .",
    "the actual implementation of the mesoscale fdm thus suffers from the lack of a mathematically justified mesoscale plastic strain rate .",
    "a more recent formulation of a continuum dislocation dynamics ( cdd ) has been proposed by hochrainer and its collaborators @xcite .",
    "it is based on a modified definition of the dislocation density tensor , in order to keep at mesoscale information concerning the geometry of the dislocations ( in particular , line directions and curvatures ) .",
    "the necessity of using an averaging procedure to obtain a meaningful continuum model has also be pointed out in the context of the cdd formulation @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , but a rigorous mathematical formulation of this coarse - graining procedure has not yet been proposed .",
    "the first attempt to better treat the closure problem has been proposed by groma and its collaborators @xcite .",
    "this is the route that we follow below .",
    "a particular attention will be paid to the nature of the coarse - graining procedure and its consequences on the local stress fields that emerge from the averaging process .",
    "we show that the emerging local friction and back - stresses , which are reminiscent of the dislocation - dislocation correlations , depend on the length scale associated to the averaging process required by the coarse - graining procedure . we also show that these correlation - induced stresses contain symmetry - breaking components that make the local stress experienced by dislocations to depend on the sign of their burgers vector . finally , we find that the emerging back - stress depends on the gradients of both the geometrically necessary and total dislocation densities .",
    "a brief version of these results has been presented in ref .  .",
    "we first clarify the mathematics and physical aspects of the coarse - graining procedure that must be used to coarse - grain the dislocation dynamics from the discrete to the continuum .",
    "we consider the simplest situation , namely a 2d dislocation system with @xmath4 edge dislocation lines parallel to the @xmath5-axis restricted to glide along the @xmath6-axis .",
    "the burgers vector of dislocation @xmath7 , @xmath8 to @xmath4 , is noted @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the sign of the dislocation @xmath7 and @xmath11 .",
    "we assume an overdamped motion : the glide velocity of the @xmath12 dislocation along the @xmath6-axis is simply proportional to the resolved peach - koehler force acting on the dislocation @xmath7 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mobility coefficient equal to the inverse of the dislocation drag coefficient , @xmath15 the external stress resolved in the slip system and @xmath16 the resolved shear stress at position @xmath17 generated by a positive dislocation located at the origin : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the shear modulus and @xmath20 the poisson ratio .",
    "the first step is to define discrete dislocation densities : @xmath21 where @xmath22 refers to the initial positions of the @xmath4 dislocations , @xmath23 is the kronecker symbol and @xmath24 the 2d dirac function .",
    "the notation @xmath25 means that the trajectory of dislocation @xmath7 depends on the initial dislocation positions @xmath22 .    by multiplying eq .",
    "( [ eq : vitessedislodetail ] ) by the dirac function @xmath26 and taking its derivative with respect to @xmath17 , we get the following transport equation for the discrete densities :    @xmath27    where , to simplify the notation , we write @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "obviously , these transport equations link the time - dependence of the one - body densities to the products of two one - body densities , which is a direct consequence of the pairwise dislocation interactions . at this stage ,",
    "the dislocation densities @xmath28 are highly singular .",
    "the next step is to introduce a coarse - graining procedure .",
    "we introduce now a coarse - graining procedure commonly used in statistical physics ( see , for exemple , ref .  ) .",
    "we first define a space and time convolution process that we use to coarse - grain microscopic fields to mesoscopic ones : @xmath30 where the weighting function @xmath31 is normalized . for simplicity , and without loss of generality ,",
    "we choose @xmath31 to be separable : @xmath32 where the functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 are separately normalized : @xmath35 the spatial linear dimension @xmath36 of @xmath33 should be of the order of the spatial resolution of the continuous model we seek and , obviously , significantly larger than the average distance between dislocations .",
    "the temporal width @xmath37 of the time window @xmath34 should , in all generality , depend on @xmath36 .",
    "in fact , the appropriate choice of @xmath37 is linked to the kinetic behaviour of the degrees of freedom that , inevitably , we will have to average out in order to close the theory : @xmath37 should be defined in such a way that the correlations we want to average out have the time to reach a stationary state at scale @xmath36 .",
    "we comment on that point in section  [ correldeaf ] . here",
    ", we just mention that , for convenience , we choose @xmath34 to be non - zero only for @xmath38 : @xmath39 mesoscopic density fields may be defined through eq .",
    "( [ eq : afcg ] ) , but this is not enough to get a consistent continuous transport theory .",
    "first , we expect that the time evolution of the mesoscopic dislocation densities will be given by first - order transport ( i.e. hyperbolic ) equations .",
    "these equations must be supplemented by initial conditions at @xmath40 which , of course , must be defined at mesoscale . in other words ,",
    "the coarse - graining procedure should be such that , when applied to eq .",
    "( [ eq : afeqrhodisc ] ) and its initial condition given by the dislocation positions @xmath22 at @xmath41 , we end up with a set of mesoscopic transport equations supplemented by continuous initial conditions that do not depend on any specific initial set @xmath22 . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath42 , @xmath43 , are given initial continuous densities , we must introduce a @xmath4-body probability density distribution @xmath44 on the ( discrete ) initial positions @xmath22 which is linked to the initial mesoscopic densities @xmath42 in a way that we discuss below . the distribution @xmath44 , where @xmath45 refers to the predefined ( and fixed ) signs of the @xmath4 dislocations , introduces a statistical ensemble on the initial discrete dislocation positions :",
    "@xmath46 is the probability to have an initial dislocation configuration with dislocation @xmath47 , whose sign is @xmath48 , in a small volume @xmath49 around position @xmath50 , dislocation @xmath51 , whose sign is @xmath52 , in a small volume @xmath53 around position @xmath54 , etc .",
    "now , the overall coarse - graining procedure is defined as the conjugate action of the space - time convolution window @xmath31 and the ensemble average defined by the probability density @xmath44 .",
    "the mesoscopic field @xmath55 associated with the discrete field @xmath56 is therefore defined by :    @xmath57    we refer to this coarse - graining procedure by the following short - hand notation : @xmath58 where the double brakets refer to the space and time convolution and the lower index @xmath59 to the ensemble average .",
    "the mesoscopic one - body and two - body densities are therefore defined by : @xmath60 and @xmath61 we mention that the two - body densities defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : afdefderhodeux ] ) are continuous function of @xmath17 and @xmath62 .",
    "this would not be the case if the coarse - graining procedure was limited to a space and time convolution .",
    "this is the second reason why we need to consider an average over a statistical ensemble .",
    "we can now precise the link , mentioned above , between the probability density @xmath44 , that defines the statistical ensemble , and the continuous dislocation densities @xmath63 that will be used as initial conditions for the mesoscopic kinetic equations .",
    "we consider that any discrete initial condition @xmath22 on the @xmath4 dislocation positions is extended to @xmath64 : @xmath65 then , using the definition of the discrete densities ( eq .  ( [ eq : afrhodisc ] ) ) and the definition of the coarse - grained ones ( eq .  ( [ eq : afdefderhoun ] ) ) , we get :    @xmath66    using eqs ( [ eq : affuncw ] ) , ( [ eq : afnormdefuncw ] ) and ( [ eq : afcondit ] ) , we obtain :    @xmath67    this equation constitutes a constraint that @xmath44 must fulfill for a given set of initial mesoscopic densities @xmath42 .",

    "this is equivalent to impose that no other information , besides that given by the constraint of eq .",
    "( [ eq : afsuivant2 ] ) , should be used to define the statistical ensemble associated to @xmath59 .",
    "this implies that the stochastic variables @xmath68 , @xmath8 to @xmath4 , must be considered as statistically independent .",

    "the next step is to solve the closure problem .",

    "their dynamics is in particular characterised by the existence of a yielding transition when they are subject to an increasing stress . both below the yielding point and in the subsequent flowing regime ,",
    "the collective dislocation motion exhibits strongly intermittent avalanche - like dynamics characterised by a slow relaxation process .",
    "it has been in particular observed @xcite that , close to the yielding point but also far below , the dynamics is characterised by power laws and , therefore , is essentially scale - free up to a cut - off time @xmath101 that depends essentially on the system size @xmath36 .",

    "we note that , because of the @xmath182-dependence of the scaling function @xmath185 , the friction stress does not simply scaled as @xmath189",
