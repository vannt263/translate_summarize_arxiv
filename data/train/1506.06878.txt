    "the maximally entangled state plays an important role in quantum information processing @xcite , including quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptographic protocols @xcite and quantum dense coding @xcite . in bipartite @xmath0 systems ,",
    "cavalcanti _ et al _ proved that all maximally entangled states are pure states @xcite .",
    "for example , in the simplest @xmath1 systems , the pure maximally entangled state is the bell state which can be written as @xmath2 up to local unitary transformations .",
    "recently , it was further shown that there exist mixed maximally entangled states ( mmess ) in bipartite @xmath3 systems with @xmath4 , which can be used as a resource for faithful teleportation @xcite .",
    "the mmes in @xmath5 systems has the form @xcite @xmath6 where the mixed state probability @xmath7 lies in the range @xmath8 , and the two pure state components are @xmath9 and @xmath10 .    the dynamic behavior of entanglement is a fundamental property of quantum systems .",
    "this is because unavoidable interactions with the environment may lead the entanglement of quantum systems to be degraded and , in certain cases , to disappear in a finite time ( i.e. , the so - called entanglement sudden death , esd ) @xcite .",
    "et al _ analyzed the dynamic behavior of entangled cavity photons being affected by two dissipative reservoirs @xcite and found that the entanglement of cavity photons initially in the two - qubit bell state decays in an asymptotic manner .",
    "however , for the newly introduced mmes , its entanglement dynamic property is still an open problem , especially for a real quantum system . since the mmes is a perfect physical resource in quantum information processing @xcite , it is desirable to investigate its dynamical property in a quantum system .",
    "this is because , once the entanglement evolution experiences the esd , we are no longer able to concentrate the entanglement of mmes , which results in some entanglement - based quantum communication protocols losing their efficacy . in this sense",
    ", the study of the entanglement dynamic property of the mmes can provide not only useful knowledge for practical quantum operations but also the necessary information to cope with the decay of entanglement .",
    "nonlocality is also a kind of resource in quantum information processing @xcite and has a close relationship with quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "the measurement - induced nonlocality ( min ) @xcite is the maximum global effect caused by locally invariant measurement , which is different from the conventionally mentioned quantum nonlocality related to the violation of bell s inequalities @xcite .",
    "moreover , the min can quantify the nonlocal resource in quantum communication protocols involving local measurement and a comparison between the pre- and postmeasurement states @xcite .",
    "luo and fu proved that , for the pure bell state , the min achieves the maximal value @xcite .",
    "but it is not clear whether or not the mmes also has the maximal nonlocality . in particular , can the maximal entanglement guarantee the maximal nonlocality ?",
    "furthermore , in order to obtain a deep understanding of the dynamic properties of mmess , it is helpful to analyze the entanglement and nonlocality distributions in an enlarged system including its environment .    in this paper , as quantified by entanglement negativity @xcite and the min @xcite , we study the dynamic properties of the mmes in the dissipative procedure of multipartite cavity - reservoir systems . it is found that the mmes can disentangle in a finite time , which is quite different from the asymptotical decay of a pure bell state .",
    "we also find that the min of the mmes is not maximal , which means that the maximal entanglement can not guarantee the maximal nonlocality .",
    "in addition , the evolution of the min is dependent on the mixed probability of the mmes .",
    "finally , we investigate the distributions of the negativity and the min in the multipartite system , where the squared negativity is monogamous but the min is not monogamous .",
    "we first recall the definition of the mmes before analyzing its dynamic properties . in @xmath11 systems ,",
    "a mixed state is an mmes if and only if it has the form @xcite @xmath12 where the mixed state probabilities satisfy @xmath13 with @xmath14 , and the pure state component is @xmath15 which is the maximally entangled pure state . in the following",
    ", we will study the dynamic properties of mmess in bipartite @xmath5 systems .",
    "we consider a practical dynamic system of two cavities interacting with two independent reservoirs .",

    "_ @xcite .    here",
    ", we have shown that , unlike the asymptotic entanglement decay of the bell state , the mmes of two cavities experiences the esd in the dissipative procedure of cavity - reservoir systems .",

    "when the time @xmath62 , the min of the two cavities transfers completely to the reservoirs .",
    "for the subsystems @xmath115 and @xmath116 , the mins first increase to their maximums and then decay asymptotically .",
    "as the probability increases , the distance between the two peaks of @xmath136 and @xmath137 becomes smaller .",
    "when the probability is @xmath61 , the distance goes to zero , and the two mins coincide completely , as shown in fig .",
    "unlike the distribution of entanglement negativity , the min in the multipartite systems is not always monogamous .",
    "when the mixed - state probability is @xmath51 , the min is monogamous and the indicator @xmath138 ( the solid blue line ) is nonnegative , as shown in fig .",
    "however , when the probabilities are @xmath97 and @xmath139 , the mins are polygamous , and @xmath138 is no longer positive [ see fig . 4(b ) and 4(c ) ] . when the probability is @xmath61 , the mmes becomes the two - qubit bell state , and the indicator @xmath138 is zero at all times for cavity - reservoir systems as shown in fig .",
    "the different distribution property from that of entanglement negativity indicates that the min and entanglement are two inequivalent types of resources for quantum information processing .",
    "although the min itself is not monogamous in multipartite multilevel systems , its functions may possess this property .",

    "recently , similar situations for the entanglement of formation have also been discussed @xcite .",
    "for the min in multipartite cavity - reservoir systems , we calculated the square of the min , and the numerical result supports the monogamy relation .",
