    "since the discovery of the `` double quasar '' 0957 + 561 by walsh  _ et al . _  ( 1979 ) ,",
    "work on gravitational lensing has grown to address many topics in astrophysics . from observations of multi - component systems and einstein rings to theoretical studies of the implications of lensing statistics on cosmology , the study of gravitational lenses provides us with a unique probe of many phenomena .",
    "lenses may function as `` cosmic telescopes '' for studying background sources ; modeling lens gravitational potentials allows us to explore the mass distribution in galaxies and clusters ; measuring time delays between the light curves for different images of the same source allows us to estimate the values of cosmological parameters .",
    "a review of some applications of gravitational lenses is given by blandford & narayan  ( 1992 ) .",
    "to engage profitably in such pursuits requires gravitational lens systems with well - measured characteristics .",
    "mg  0414 + 0534 ( also 4c05.19 and pks0411 + 05 ; hereafter mg0414 ) is a gravitational lens system that is very bright at radio wavelengths and has optical and infrared counterparts .",
    "mg0414 was discovered in the mit - green  bank survey ( bennett _ et al . _",
    "it was selected from the survey in a gravitational lens search by hewitt  ( 1986 ) and hewitt  _ et al . _  ( 1989 ) .",
    "it was later studied in more detail by hewitt  _ et al . _  ( 1992 ) and katz  &  hewitt  ( 1993 ) .",
    "the later observations showed that mg0414 displays many of the characteristics expected in a gravitational lens system : morphology typical of lensing by an elliptical potential , similar spectral indices of the components , and frequency - independent flux density ratios of the components . while the optical flux ratios reported by schechter  &  moore  ( 1993 ) , falco  ( 1993 ) , and angonin - willaime  _ et al . _  ( 1994 ) differ significantly from those in the radio , witt , mao , &  schechter  ( 1995 ) conclude from simulations of microlensing in the mg0414 system that the differences between the radio and optical flux ratios are consistent with microlensing models with plausible physical parameters .",
    "in addition , the observation of significant reddening of the quasar images has fueled speculation that the flux ratio differences are due at least in part to obscuration by dust ( lawrence  _ et al . _",
    "1995 ; vanderriest , angonin - willaime , & rigaut  1996 ) .",
    "other evidence in favor of gravitational lensing includes the discovery of the lensing galaxy by schechter  &  moore  ( 1993 ) , the measurement of similar optical spectra for the a and b components ( angonin - willaime  _ et al . _",
    "1994 ) , and the measurement of the source redshift of  2.639 ( lawrence  _ et al . _",
    "1995 ) .",
    "herein we describe vla observations which were planned with several objectives in mind : _ high angular resolution _ , to reveal structure in the components which would be useful for constraining lens models ; _ sensitivity to extended emission _ , to map any extended structure , also useful in modeling the lens and in examining the nature of the background source ; _ measurement of polarization structure _ , to provide information about the background source and to measure faraday rotation ; _ multifrequency observations _ , to measure the spectral indices of the components ; and _ sensitivity to faint objects _ , to search for a fifth image and the lensing galaxy itself .",
    "mg0414 was observed with the a  configuration of the vla at 15  ghz on 1992  november  18 and 1992  december  15 , at 1.4 , 5 , 8 , and  15 ghz on 1993  january  15 , at 8 and 22  ghz on 1994  april  1 , and with the b  configuration at 15  ghz on 1993  march  9 .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table  [ obssum ] .",
    "the 15  ghz runs in 1992 and on 1993  march  9 were part of a longer term monitoring program , and were selected because they were the longest of the monitoring runs that took place when the sky was clear . during the 1993  january  15 observing ,",
    "thick cloud cover and a snowstorm complicated the calibration , especially at 15  ghz . at that frequency , 200 minutes were spent on mg0414 , but about one - third of the data were discarded because of very poor phase stability . at the other frequencies ,",
    "phase stability was satisfactory .",
    "weather conditions during the 1994 observations were ideal ; the vla s reference pointing mode ( perley  1995 ) was used at 22  ghz . in all but the monitoring observations the delay center was placed two arc  seconds east of the center of the system , rather than directly at the center , to avoid introducing any biases that might affect our search for a fifth image or radio emission from the lensing galaxy .",

    "january  15 , the flux density scale was set by reference to 3c286 because 3c48 was resolved on even the shortest interferometric baselines . because 3c48 is resolved on all baselines at 22  ghz , observations of it at that frequency were bracketed by short scans on the phase calibrator 0133 + 476 , allowing the creation of a model of 3c48 which was used to set the flux density scale .",
    "the vla antenna gains at all frequencies were determined from short observations of the calibrator source 0420 - 014 .",
    "this calibrator was also used to determine the feed polarizations of the antennas . in the monitoring runs ,",
    "3c147 was used to fix the linear polarization position angle .",
    "all calibration and mapping was done with nrao s astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "the maps shown here were produced after several iterations of phase self - calibration , followed in some cases by one iteration of amplitude self - calibration .",
    "the self - calibration significantly improved the dynamic range of the images .",
    "deconvolution was performed with the aips task mx , restricting clean components to small regions at the positions of the four objects .",
    "figures [ lmap ] through [ kmap ] show , respectively , the 1.4  ghz through 22  ghz maps produced from the 1993  january  15 observations .",
    "the dynamic ranges in the best maps are limited to about 2500:1 ( peak intensity : rms noise level ) , which is much smaller than the dynamic range of 10,000:1 expected if radiometer noise is the limiting factor . since well - known methods for improving the dynamic ranges of vla maps proved unhelpful",
    "( see for example perley  1989 ) , we suspect that the deconvolution procedure itself limited the dynamic range ( see briggs  & cornwell  1994 , briggs  1995 ) .",
    "the combination of the vla dirty beam and the particular morphology of mg0414 appears to exacerbate this effect ; tests performed with noiseless models of mg0414 confirm that this is indeed the case .",
    "further work in investigating deconvolution algorithms is needed to improve the dynamic ranges of vla maps of mg0414 .",
    "the most notable feature in the high - resolution maps is the extended structure : component  b is extended to the southeast , and components a1 and a2 are extended toward each other , with a faint connecting `` bridge '' of flux density approximately 2  mjy visible at 15  ghz .",
    "the extensions are consistent with the structure seen in a 5  ghz merlin image ( garrett  _ et al . _  1992 ) , and with that seen in the hubble space telescope ( hst ) image of falco , lehr , & shapiro  ( 1996 ) .",
    "our data provide upper limits on the surface brightness of a fifth image of the background source and on any emission associated with the lensing galaxy . if we take these limits to be 10 times the rms surface brightness in each map , we find they are 6.1 , 2.0 , 1.2 , 2.5 , and 3.3  mjy at 1.4 , 5 , 8 , 15 and 22  ghz , respectively",
    ". expressed as a fraction of the flux density of component  b the limits are 0.017 , 0.013 , 0.013 , 0.038 , and 0.072 .",
    "we do not detect `` component  @xmath0 , '' the sixth object west of component  b detected at optical wavelengths by schechter &  moore  ( 1993 ) , and confirmed by angonin - willaime  _ et al . _  ( 1994 ) and falco  _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1996 ) .",
    "the 1.4  ghz observation was intended to reveal any low surface brightness extended emission which is likely to have a steep radio spectrum and to give a @xmath27 detection of 70  mjy distributed uniformly over a circle of radius @xmath28 an area the size of the primary beam ( about @xmath29 at 1.4  ghz ) was mapped , but no extended emission smaller than @xmath30 ( the maximum angular scale to which this configuration of the vla is sensitive ) was found , even in maps in which the short baselines were given large weights .",
    "absolute and relative radiometry of mg0414 ( referred to component  b ) are presented in tables  [ absrad ]  &  [ relrad ] , respectively . except for the monitoring observations and the 8  ghz observation on 1994  april  1 , the flux density uncertainties reported in table  [ absrad ]",
    "were computed by comparing three effects : 1 )  the scatter in the amplitudes on unresolved baselines of the calibrated uv - data for the primary flux calibrator , 2 )  the uncertainty incurred in the transfer of the antenna gain amplitudes from the primary flux calibrator to the phase calibrator ( 0420 - 014 ) , and 3 )  the scatter in the ensemble of flux density measurements made by splitting the dataset into many short time segments and mapping each separately . in all cases ,",
    "1 ) was negligible with respect to 2 ) . since 2 ) and 3 ) are independent , the flux density uncertainties were found by adding them in quadrature .",
    "for the 15  ghz observation on 1993  january  15 which used 3c286 to set the flux scale , an additional 2% uncertainty was added in quadrature reflecting the unknown systematic difference in the flux density scale between 3c48 and 3c286 .",
    "the difference in elevation between the flux calibration source and the phase calibrator was less than @xmath31 at 15 and 22  ghz , so elevation - dependent opacity differences should not make a significant contribution to the error . for the monitoring observations , we estimate the error from the scatter in flux estimates over the whole monitoring dataset ( 3.5% ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the relative flux densities reported in table  [ relrad ] were computed from scatter of the a1/b , a2/b , and c / b ratios in the segmented data described above .",
    "the c / b ratio at 8  ghz is significantly different from that reported in katz &  hewitt  ( 1993 ) .",
    "however , since the data used in katz &  hewitt  ( 1993 ) had a number of problems , and the ratios in table  [ relrad ] are consistent with those measured from other radio observations ( e.g. hewitt  _ et al . _",
    "1992 ) , we conclude that the difference in ratios can not be regarded as reliable evidence for variability .",

    "is required to constrain lens models .",
    "the maps of mg0414 at 15 and 22  ghz show structure on a scale comparable to the sizes of the synthesized beams , making possible an improvement over the modeling effort of kochanek  ( 1991 ) and hewitt  _ et al . _  ( 1992 ) . modeling work is underway using both the vla data reported here and vlbi data ( ellithorpe , hewitt , &  kochanek  1996 ) . our failure to detect `` component  @xmath0 ''",
    "is not surprising in light of the fact that it is resolved in the hst image , and thus appears to be a galaxy ( falco  _ et al . _",
    "1996 ) .",
    "if the source is an isotropic radiator , the radio spectral luminosity density implied by the observed flux density of component  b is @xmath106  erg  s@xmath107  hz@xmath107 in the rest frame of the source ( assuming @xmath108  km  sec@xmath107  mpc@xmath107 , @xmath109 , and @xmath110 ) .",

    "seielstad  ( 1991 ) the object appears as a double source ; the brighter of the two components is at the position of the mg0414 quasar images .",
    "the fainter of the two is not seen in the 1.4  ghz data in this work , implying a source size greater than @xmath30 .",
    "if the two radio components were physically associated , their angular separation of @xmath113 would correspond to a linear distance of @xmath114  mpc at the source , at the high end of the distribution of radio source sizes ( fanaroff & riley  1974 ) .",
    "however , there is no evidence in the nrao vla sky survey ( condon _ et al . _  1993 ) for radio emission between the two sources , and it is unlikely that they are physically associated .    since the initial studies of mg0414 by hewitt  _ et al . _  ( 1992 ) , the nature of the background source has been an issue because of its unusually red optical spectrum .",
    "observations in several wavebands reported by lawrence  _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1995 ) have led them to conclude that the source is a quasar made to look unusual by the passage of the light rays through several magnitudes of extinction due to dust in the lensing galaxy . however , in the hst image of falco  _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1996 ) there is an arc of emission connecting component  b to the a1-a2 component pair .",
    "the arc is significantly less red than the image cores .",
    "thus they argue that if the arc and core sources have the same intrinsic color , and the arc - core separation is small , then the reddening is intrinsic to the core source rather than due to the lensing galaxy .    in figure  [ allflux ]",
    "we plot mg0414 flux density measurements from this work and from the literature .",
    "the radio spectrum turns over at low frequencies , characteristic of many high redshift compact objects . the small linear size and",
    "the peak of the radio spectrum near 1  ghz suggest that mg0414 is an example of a ghz - peaked spectrum ( gps ) radio source .",
    "the gps sources form a class closely related to , and perhaps a subclass of , the compact steep spectrum ( css ) sources .",
    "the gps sources have sub - kiloparsec sizes and spectral turnovers near 1  ghz , while the css sources have sizes of 110  kpc and spectral turnovers at one to several  hundred  mhz ( fanti  _ et al .",
    "_  1990 , kapahi  1981 , peacock & wall  1982 , heckman  _ et al . _",
    "the gps sources are strongly correlated with high redshifts and large radio luminosities ( gopal - krishna , patnaik , &  steppe  1983 ) ; mg0414 has both properties . the spectral index of mg0414 below the turnover frequency is @xmath115 , intermediate to the ranges seen for gps and css sources . also , the low polarization fraction of mg0414 is consistent with the properties of these classes .",
    "interestingly , another gravitational lens , 0218 + 357 , has also been identified as a gps source ( odea , baum , & stanghellini  1991 ) .",
    "one possible explanation for the low polarization fraction is beam depolarization , which occurs when the linear polarization angle varies over a scale smaller than that of the synthesized beam . assuming @xmath116  km  s@xmath107  mpc@xmath107 , @xmath117 , @xmath110 , unit magnification , and a likely lensing galaxy redshift of  0.5  ( kochanek  1992 )",
    ", the 5  ghz beamwidth of @xmath118 corresponds to a linear distance of @xmath119  kpc ; at the source redshift of @xmath120 , @xmath118 corresponds to a linear distance of @xmath121  kpc .",
    "therefore , in order to reduce the polarization fraction by 50% , the rotation measure must change by about 200  rad  m@xmath122 over a distance of approximately 1.1  kpc .",
    "this arises naturally in models of gps sources , but requires a lensing galaxy with unusual properties in order to produce the required depolarization as well as the observed optical reddening ( schechter  1995 ) .",
    "we have resolved some structure in components a1 , a2 , and b , at 15  and 22  ghz which is consistent with the arc seen in the hst image of falco  _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) .",
    "we have not detected emission from any other extended sources , from the lensing galaxy , or from `` component @xmath0 . ''",
    "it is unlikely that the observed structure will suffice to impose strong constraints on models of the radial mass distribution of the lens .",
    "further work should address the deconvolution - imposed dynamic range limit in the maps , to reach the theoretical sensitivity limit and possibly resolve more low surface - brightness structure .",
    "the fractional polarized flux density from mg0414 is very low , and is detected at the threshold where our polarization calibration becomes uncertain . to exploit the polarization of the source for time delay measurements or other studies ,",
    "a program designed for more careful calibration of the polarization properties of the vla will be required .",
    "mg 0414 + 0534 is a powerful high redshift quasar in which the effects of obscuration in the source ( or less likely , in the lens ) are extremely important .",
    "the source spectral peak at approximately 1  ghz , the compact structure , the high redshift , the large radio luminosity , and the low polarization fraction are all consistent with the ghz - peaked  spectrum ( gps ) sources .",
    "gps sources are thought to be agn which are confined to a very small space by an exceptionally dense circumnuclear gas .",
    "if the background source in mg0414 is indeed a gps source , then the gravitational lens may provide an unusual opportunity to study a member of the gps class through a `` cosmic telescope . ''",
    "we are presently processing vlba data which will address this possibility .",
