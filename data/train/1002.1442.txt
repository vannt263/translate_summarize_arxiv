    "another particularly interesting system to consider is the application of a periodic potential to graphene , that is , a superlattice ( sl ) , which under special conditions leads to collimation of electron beams@xcite .    as found recently in ref . , using a tight - binding formalism , the dispersion relation for such a sl can reveal extra dirac points at the fermi level @xcite .",
    "close to the fermi level the electronic properties of graphene are well described by the massless 2d dirac equation .",
    "in two recent studies , ref . and , an exact condition was found for the emergence of extra dirac points ( zero modes ) in the presence of a sinusoidal or square - wave sl potential . however , both studies are not able to describe the character and spatial distribution in @xmath0 space of these new dirac points , as they expand the spectrum for small @xmath1 . in this work",
    "we describe under which condition this is possible and also where these extra dirac points arise in the electronic structure of massless dirac fermions in single - layer graphene when a square - wave periodic potential is applied .",
    "further , we analytically investigate the anisotropic renormalization of the group velocities at these new dirac points , and find that the degree of the renormalization depends on the parameter @xmath2 , which is linear in the barrier height @xmath3 and period @xmath4 of the sl , in the sense that , @xmath5 holds for @xmath6 such that an extra dirac point arises while for very high values @xmath6 we have @xmath7 .",
