    "the kinetic undercooling condition states that the potential at a point on the free boundary is proportional to the normal velocity of the boundary at that point .",

    "there has also been some research on the problem in a channel geometry ; the selection problem of determining the discrete set of allowed widths of a travelling finger for varying kinetic undercooling strength ( the analogue of the famous selection problem with surface tension  @xcite ) has been analysed using exponential asymptotics  @xcite , and some numerical studies have been attempted  @xcite .",
    "the conclusions vary : asymptotics suggests that kinetic undercooling selects discrete fingers whose width tends to @xmath3 as kinetic undercooling vanishes , while numerical results suggest either no selection ( a continuous family of solutions )  @xcite or discrete branches whose width vanishes  @xcite .",
    "we aim to explain these discrepancies in the current paper .",
    "there are also linear stability results  @xcite and exact travelling waves for sufficiently large kinetic undercooling  @xcite .",

    "the content of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : formulation ] we outline the governing systems of equations . in section  [ sec : bubble ]",
    "we examine expanding and contracting inviscid bubbles . with linear stability analysis (  [ sec : stability ] ) we show that in both cases , kinetic undercooling destabilises a near - circular bubble once its radius is outside a critical interval .",
    "we also present strong numerical evidence (  [ sec : numerics ] ) that this instability generically leads to the formation of _ corners _ on the boundary .",
    "this corner formation represents a blow - up in the curvature , but not speed , of the boundary .",
    "in contrast , surface tension suppresses singularities in both curvature and speed ( corners may exist in the unregularised problem , but they are not generic , and exist at a stationary point for a finite time before smoothing off  @xcite ) .    in section  [ sec : smallbubble ] we show that the boundary in the limit of small bubble size ( equivalently , large kinetic undercooling ) behaves to leading order as a plane curve that evolves so that each point on the curve moves with constant normal velocity , once a time scaling is applied . for contracting bubbles this limit is particularly relevant ; the extinction behaviour of a bubble in the full hele ",
    "shaw problem is given by the extinction behaviour of the boundary contracting according to the simpler constant velocity rule .",
    "we derive the exact solution to the leading order problem for an initially elliptical boundary , which demonstrates the formation of corners and the asymptotic shape of the boundary : a slit of vanishing aspect ratio .",
    "such behaviour is likely to be generic for a wide class of initial conditions .    in section  [ sec : channel ]",

    "shaw flow with kinetic undercooling in a channel .",
    "here the pertinent question is the existence of travelling wave solutions : either a front that spans the width of the channel ( and usually exhibiting corners ) , or a finger of width strictly less than the channel .",
    "explicit solutions have been found for the travelling fronts  @xcite . for fingers , we present a numerical scheme , previously described in our conference paper  @xcite , which shows that corner - free fingers exist for a continuous range of widths bounded below by a minimum width that vanishes as kinetic undercooling goes to zero .",
    "while this continuum of solutions appears to contradict the findings of chapman and king  @xcite , who show there exist discrete families of analytic fingers , the results are entirely consistent because the numerical scheme can not distinguish between solutions characterised by analytic fingers and travelling fingers that are corner - free but not analytic ( due to the nonexistence of higher derivatives ) .",
    "indeed , chapman and king discuss the existence of these non - analytic travelling finger solutions , and predict the resulting difficulty of numerically computing the discrete spectrum of analytic solutions .",
    "these results also explain the conclusion of a previous numerical study  @xcite that kinetic undercooling offered no discrete selection ( the discrete branches we found previously  @xcite are the result of small numerical errors ) . in section  [ sec : numnumchannel ]",

    "two boundary conditions are needed on the free boundary @xmath0 : a kinematic condition that relates the fluid velocity to that of the boundary , and a dynamic condition that , in this case , includes the kinetic undercooling term .",
    "the model has two parameters : the kinetic undercooling coefficient @xmath8 ( a length scale ) and the far - field source strength . for this geometry",
