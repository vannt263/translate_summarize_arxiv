    "in the last four years observations with the _ rossi x  ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) satellite have revealed the presence of several quasi ",
    "periodic phenomena at frequencies higher than 100 hz in the fourier power spectra of low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "first , the kilohertz quasi  periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) were discovered ( van der klis et al .",
    "1996a , b ; strohmayer , zhang , & swank 1996 ; strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; for the most recent review see van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "somewhat later , nearly coherent oscillations were discovered during type i x  ray bursts in several of these lmxbs ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; for a review see swank 2000 ) ; these burst oscillations presumably occur at frequencies close to the neutron star spin frequency ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the khz qpos are nearly always found in pairs .",
    "although their frequencies can vary over several hundred hz , the frequency separation between the twin khz qpos , @xmath3 , remains approximately constant , close to the inferred spin frequency of the neutron star ( but see e.g. van der klis et al .",

    "1998a ; mndez , van der klis , & van paradijs 1998 ; mndez & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "various models exist for the origin of these qpos . immediately after their discovery a beat frequency model was proposed ( strohmayer et al . 1996 ) , of which the sonic  point model is the most elaborate example ( miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ) .",
    "later , stella & vietri ( 1998 ) proposed the relativistic precession model ( see also psaltis & norman 2000 ; but see markovi & lamb 2000 ) and osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 ) introduced the two  oscillator model . in the latter model",
    "the qpo at @xmath4 ( the lower khz qpo ) occurs at the keplerian frequency of material orbiting the neutron star , whereas in the other two models the qpo at @xmath5 ( the upper khz qpo ) is the one that is keplerian .",
    "the possibility that sidebands to the two main khz peaks could occur was mentioned by several authors ( miller et al .",
    "1998 ; psaltis & norman 2000 ; miller 2000 ) , but no sidebands , nor in fact any other khz qpos beyond the initial pair were detected up to now ( see e.g. , mndez & van der klis 2000 ) . in the lmxbs 4u  160852 ,",

    "1996 ) displaying consecutive power spectra to visualize the time evolution of the qpo frequency . for each source separately , we fitted this qpo peak in each power spectrum in the range 100 hz above and 100 hz below the traced qpo frequency ( so to exclude the upper khz qpo ) with a constant plus a lorentzian .",
    "for each source separately , we used the shift - and - add method described by mndez et al .",
    "( 1998b ) to shift each lower khz qpo peak to the same frequency and average the aligned power spectra .",
    "we then fitted each average power spectrum ( one per source ) with a constant plus lorentzians to represent the qpos .",

    "figure  [ sidebands ] shows the resulting power spectra for 4u  160852 , 4u  172834 , and 4u  163653 after applying the abovementioned procedure .",
    "we discovered a new khz qpo in these three sources at a frequency that is , respectively , 52.8@xmath10.9 hz , 64@xmath12 hz , and 58.4@xmath11.9 hz higher than that of the lower khz qpo , at a significance level of 6.3@xmath0 , 6.0@xmath0 , and 3.7@xmath0 ( single trial ) , respectively ( table  [ prop_qpos ] ) .",
    "this new khz qpo is detected at the same time as the twin khz qpos that were already known in these sources .    in 4u",
    "163653 we detected a fourth khz qpo , at the same frequency separation below the lower khz qpo ( figure  [ sidebands ] , table  [ prop_qpos ] ) .",
    "this new khz qpo was detected in a single trial , at a 3@xmath0 significance level .",
    "the presence of two , symmetrically located , peaks on either side of the lower khz qpo suggests the new khz qpos are sidebands to the main peak and from now on we will refer to these new khz qpos as such .",
    "no significant lower sidebands could be detected in the other two sources .",
    "we applied an f  test to the @xmath9 of the fits with and without the upper sideband in order to test its significance .",
    "we derived values for the significance of the upper sideband similar to those calculated from the errors in the fit parameters which we quoted above . conservatively estimating the number of trials involved in obtaining our results at @xmath2400 ( the number of frequencies where we searched for a qpo , @xmath24000 , divided by the fwhm of the qpo @xmath210 hz ) still results in a @xmath10 detection in case of 4u  160852 .",
    "for each source we divided the data into two parts based on the frequency of the lower khz qpo in the power spectra . in each of these parts we shifted the lower khz qpo peak to the same frequency as before and fitted the average power spectrum . in 4u  163653 and 4u  172834",
    "the separation between the upper sideband and the main peak , @xmath11 , is consistent with being the same in the two parts , whereas in 4u  160852 @xmath11 increases significantly ( 2.9@xmath0 , table  [ prop_qpos ] ) . in 4u  160852 , the frequency of the upper sideband increases by @xmath2139 hz as the frequency of the lower khz qpo increases by @xmath2134 hz .",
    "the fact that the distance of the sideband remains approximately constant ( to within @xmath24.5 hz ) as both peaks move over @xmath2135 hz is an additional argument supporting the interpretation of the new khz qpo as a sideband to the lower khz qpo .",
    "simultaneously , the frequency distance of the sideband to the upper khz qpo changes by nearly 60 hz ; this and the fact that the sideband is much narrower than the upper khz qpo , strongly argues in favor of the sideband being un  related to the upper khz qpo .    to correct for the relative motion of the sideband with respect to the main peak , which artificially broadened it in our previous analysis , we calculated the frequencies to which each power spectrum should be shifted in order to align the sideband , assuming a linear relation between the frequencies of the sideband and the main peak . applying this new shift to the data of 4u",
    "160852 we indeed obtained a narrower sideband ( 9.7@xmath12.2 hz ) , although the effect is marginal . aligning the power spectra on a hypothetical lower sideband did not result in a significant detection in 4u  160852 .",
    "the upper sideband is also significantly detected in 4u  160852 when only a fraction of the data is selected and no shift - and - add is applied , although at a smaller significance level .",
    "applying the same shifts to the power spectra calculated for the two energy bands , we measured the dependence of the fractional rms amplitude on photon energy of the detected qpos . only for 4u",
    "160852 we were able to significantly detect the sideband in both energy bands .",
    "the increase in fractional rms amplitude with energy in 4u  160852 is different for the lower and upper khz qpo ( see mndez et al .",
    "although the fractional rms amplitude of the sideband increased from 1.7%@xmath10.2% to 2.6%@xmath10.3% as a function of photon energy ( 2.08.720 kev ) in 4u  160852 , the uncertainties on the measurements of the fractional rms amplitudes of the sideband did not enable us to distinguish between the two different trends observed for the khz qpo pair .",
    "the fwhm of the lower khz qpo , that of the upper khz qpo , and that of the sideband nor the sideband separation nor the peak separation between the upper and lower khz qpo changed significantly with respect to the values obtained in the total energy band .",
    "we also investigated the lower frequency part of the power spectra for the presence of a qpo at a frequency equal to the difference between the sideband and the lower khz qpo .",
    "we detected a low frequency qpo ( lfqpo ) at 40.9@xmath10.7 hz with a fwhm of 19@xmath12 hz and a fractional rms amplitude of 2.8@xmath10.1% in 4u  160852 ( see also psaltis , belloni , & van der klis 1999 ) . in 4u  172834 , a lfqpo at 41.5@xmath10.2 hz , with a fwhm of 19.9@xmath10.8 hz and a fractional rms amplitude of 5.3@xmath10.1% was present ( see also ford et al .",

    "we have discovered a new khz qpo at frequencies close to the frequency of the lower khz qpo in the three lmxbs 4u  160852 , 4u  172834 , and 4u  163653 .",
    "this new khz qpo moves in frequency with the lower khz qpo and maintains a distance to it which is nearly ( but not exactly ) constant ; its distance to the upper khz qpo varies much more . in 4u  163653 an additional qpo",
    "was found symmetrically located at the lower frequency side of the lower khz qpo peak ( 3@xmath0 ) .",
    "these facts suggest that the new khz qpos are sidebands to the lower khz qpo .",
    "if these qpos are sidebands due to an amplitude modulation of the lower khz qpo , there must be an additional mechanism reducing the amplitude of the lower sideband or enhancing the upper sideband , since in 4u  160852 and 4u  172834 the presence of a symmetric lower sideband can be excluded .",
    "if the lower khz qpo is a beaming oscillation , a single - sideband ( rotational ) beat frequency scenario could apply ( e.g. alpar & shaham 1985 ) .",
    "however , this would lead to a lower rather than an upper sideband , opposite to what is observed , unless the modulating part of the disk is counter rotating .",
    "when both rotational modulation and amplitude modulation of the formation of the lower khz qpo produce sidebands , but of opposite phase , destructive interference could in principle cause the amplitude of the lower frequency sideband to be suppressed . kommers et al .",
    "( 1998 ) observed sidebands to the pulses of the pulsar 4u  162667 at much lower frequencies ( @xmath20.1hz ) .",
    "there the lower sideband was stronger than the upper one and they proposed a model using both amplitude modulation and rotational modulation of the pulsar beam .    the frequency separation between the sideband and the main peak ( @xmath25060 hz ) , hereafter ` sideband separation ' is reminiscent of typical frequencies of horizontal branch oscillations ( hbos ) in z sources and low frequency qpos ( lfqpos ) in atoll sources .",
    "however , the frequency of the lfqpo ( @xmath241 hz ) apparent in two of the three sources is inconsistent with the observed sideband separation .",
    "furthermore , the increase in sideband separation with increasing lower khz qpo frequency we observed in 4u  160852 is less than the increase in hbo frequency with lower khz qpo frequency usually seen ( psaltis et al .",
    "so , the sidebands appear to be unrelated to the lfqpo in these atoll sources . mechanisms that might explain these qpos , such as the magnetospheric beat frequency model ( alpar & shaham 1985 ; lamb et al .",
    "1985 ) or the lense - thirring precession model ( stella & vietri 1998 ) could be used in explaining the lfqpo and the sideband , however one model can not explain both simultaneously unless the lfqpo and the sideband reflect frequencies at different radii in the disk .    none of the khz qpo models in the literature ( e.g. the sonic point model , miller et al .",
    "1998 , miller 2000 , the relativistic precession model , stella & vietri 1998 , and the two  oscillator model , osherovich & titarchuk 1999 ) in their present form predict the presence of an upper sideband to the lower khz qpo with a sideband separation different from the lfqpo frequency .",
    "one of the effects possibly occurring in the sonic point beat frequency model ( miller et al .",
    "1998 , miller 2000 ) could perhaps explain the formation of the upper sideband we discovered .",
    "the density enhancements along the spiral flow responsible for the generation of the lower khz qpo rotate around the neutron star @xmath2510 times before reaching the surface ( miller et al .",
    "1998 ) . therefore , the orbital frequency of the enhancements is higher than the orbital frequency at the sonic point , the beat frequency will end up at slightly higher frequencies than the frequency of the lower khz qpo .",
    "since the sideband has a fwhm of @xmath210 hz corresponding to at least @xmath2100 cycles at a keplerian frequency of 1000 hz , the beat frequency will end up at frequencies 50100 hz higher .",
    "the orbital frequency of the enhancements and the change in the sideband separation as a function of the frequency of the lower khz qpo , as observed in 4u  160852 , will depend on the details of the physical processes at work close to the neutron star .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of a third kilohertz quasi  periodic oscillation ( khz qpo ) in the power spectra of the low  mass x  ray binaries 4u  160852 ( 6.3@xmath0 ) , 4u  172834 ( 6.0@xmath0 ) , and 4u  163653 ( 3.7@xmath0 ) which is present simultaneously with the previously  known khz qpo pair . </S>",
    "<S> the new khz qpo is found at a frequency that is 52.8@xmath10.9 hz , 64@xmath12 hz , 58.4@xmath11.9 hz higher than the frequency of the lower khz qpo in 4u  160852 , 4u  172834 , and 4u  163653 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the frequency of the new khz qpo and the lower khz qpo increased in 4u  160852 from 49.6@xmath11.4 hz to 53.9@xmath10.5 hz when the frequency of the lower khz qpo increased from 672 hz to 806 hz . </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously the difference between the frequency of the new khz qpo and the upper khz qpo increased by @xmath260 hz , suggesting that the new khz qpo is unrelated to the upper khz qpo . in 4u  163653 a fourth , weaker , </S>",
    "<S> khz qpo is simultaneously detected ( 3@xmath0 ) at the same frequency separation below the lower khz qpo , suggesting the new khz qpos are sidebands to the lower khz qpo . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the nature of this new khz qpo and its implications on the models for the khz qpos . </S>"
