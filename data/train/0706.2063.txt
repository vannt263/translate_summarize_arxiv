    "since the famous work of berry @xcite , the geometric phase has been widely investigated and its generalizations have been made in many ways @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "recently much concern has been concentrated on the geometric phase of entangled states as well as mixed states @xcite@xcite .",
    "coherent state is an important physical concept both theoretically and experimentally @xcite@xcite .",
    "it can be generated from an arbitrary reference state , and in this brief report landau levels are chosen to be such reference states . though coherent states of landau level have been studied in refs . @xcite@xcite and berry s phase for coherent states as well as squeezed",
    "coherent states of a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator has been illustrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , berry s phase for coherent states of landau levels which is highly degenerate and with an additional parameter , i.e. , the magnetic field @xmath0 , is still worthy of further investigation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we show how to get the coherent states of landau levels , and these states can be regarded as a result of a magnetic flux moved adiabaticly from infinity to a finite place on the plane . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate the abelian and non - abelian berry s phase for coherent states of landau levels . the abelian berry s phase is just like an alternative version of the aharonov - bohm ( ab ) effect ; the difference between them is that in our case the cyclic motion of the magnetic flux results in the phase shift . in sec .",
    "iv , we provide the explicit form of the hamiltonian and berry s connections for squeezed coherent states of landau levels .",
    "conclusion and discussion are made in the last section .",
    "the motion of a free electron in a two - dimensional @xmath1-plane in a static magnetic field along the @xmath2-direction is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath3,\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the mass of the electron , @xmath5 is the planck constant , @xmath6 is the electron charge , @xmath7 is the speed of light in the vacuum , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the linear momentums , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are vector potentials of the magnetic field satisfying @xmath12 . for simplicity the zeeman s term is not included .",
    "we introduce the following operators @xmath13 from which one can form a pair of operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 which satisfy the commutation relation @xmath16=1 $ ] : @xmath17 in this case we can rewrite the hamiltonian in a more simpler form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 are raising and lowering operators between landau levels with @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the energy of landau levels is @xmath22 .",
    "one knows that landau levels are highly degenerate . in the degenerate space of landau levels",
    "we can introduce another pair of raising and lowering operators @xmath23 we choose the symmetric gauge @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and then @xmath26 , @xmath27 are commutative with @xmath15 , @xmath14 and @xmath28=1 $ ] .",
    "therefore the hamiltonian commutes with @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the ground state is defined as @xmath29 $ ] , and all other eigenstates of this system can be generated from @xmath30 state with raising operators @xmath31 .",
    "the states @xmath32 are also orthogonal and normalized bases for this system .",
    "states with the same @xmath33 are in the same energy level , and states with the same @xmath33 but different @xmath34 stand for the different degenerate states on the same energy level .",
    "the coherent states of landau levels are generated in the following way as in @xcite : @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the coherent states is : @xmath37,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 , and the eigenstates of this hamiltonian are always combinations of the degenerate states with the same energy : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are arbitrary complex numbers which make @xmath41 normalized .",
    "we put eq .",
    "( [ b ] ) back to eq .",
    "( [ csh ] ) , this would make the hamiltonian easier to understand , we get @xmath42.\\ ] ] we found that the magnetic vector potential is added by a constant vector potential .",
    "this can be regarded as a result of a magnetic flux perpendicular to the plane moving adiabaticly from infinitely far to a finitely far position on the plane . in the following",
    "we would like to show how we get the result .",
    "we can assume that the added magnetic flux is a gaussian form magnetic field centered @xmath43 , @xmath44 $ ] , where @xmath45 is refered to as the spread or standard deviation for the gaussian function .",
    "and we may choose the symmetric gauge with respect to @xmath46 , i.e. , @xmath47 , the nonsingular vector potential for this added magnetic field is @xmath48 - 1\\}(y - y_0)}{2\\pi[(x - x_0)^2+(y - y_0)^2]},\\nonumber \\\\",
    "a'_y&=&-\\frac{\\phi_0 \\{\\exp[-\\frac{(x - x_0)^2+(y - y_0)^2}{\\delta^2}]-1\\}(x - x_0)}{2\\pi[(x - x_0)^2+(y - y_0)^2]}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one may observe that @xmath49 has nothing to do with the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) when @xmath50 .",
    "now we assume that the electron in the plane is in a certain eigenstate , for example , @xmath51 , in this case the electron is localized near the origin because of @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 , so when the flux moves adiabaticly to a place @xmath46 which is finitely far from the electron ( i.e. @xmath55 ) , we assume that the electron is still distributed around the origin and @xmath56 near the origin of the plane can be regarded as constants .",
    "then the hamiltonian for the electron will be of the form ( [ cshb ] ) with @xmath57 } { 2\\pi(x_0 ^ 2+y_0 ^ 2)},\\nonumber \\\\ x_2=\\sqrt{\\frac{e}{2\\hbar b c}}\\frac{\\phi_0 x_0 [ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_0 ^ 2+y_0 ^ 2}{\\delta^2}\\right)-1]}{2\\pi(x_0 ^ 2+y_0 ^ 2)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this modification of the hamiltonian also corresponds to the following transformation @xmath58 , where @xmath59}{\\pi b(x_0 ^ 2+y_0 ^ 2 ) } , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\delta y=\\frac{\\phi_0 y_0 [ \\exp(-\\frac{x_0 ^ 2+y_0 ^ 2}{\\delta^2 } ) -1]}{\\pi b(x_0 ^ 2+y_0 ^ 2)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so the state @xmath60 will become @xmath61 .",
    "since the distribution of the electron is near the origin , one also makes sure that @xmath62 .",
    "the coherent states of landau levels is nothing but the shifted eigenstates of landau levels in the phase space , here we assume such a shift happens in real space @xmath63 .",
    "when the conditions above are satisfied , this assumption is reasonable .",
    "it is @xmath49 who causes this small shift .",
    "we may see from eq .",
    "( [ dx ] ) that the direction of @xmath49 , i.e. , the sign of @xmath64 is related to the direction of the shift .",
    "when @xmath65 the shift is parallel to the direction of the flux , and vice versa .",
    "interestingly , if the flux circles the electron once , the electron will also circle the origin in a much smaller loop once .",
    "this is the reason why the berry s phase emerged as we will show in the next section .",
    "we know that the landau levels are highly degenerate , and so is the coherent states of landau levels .",
    "berry s phase for degenerate states was presented in @xcite and may have a non - abelian nature .",
    "we calculated the berry s connections as follows : @xmath66 in the degenerate space , i.e. , between states with the same @xmath33 , the berry s connections become @xmath67 we found that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are abelian . with the adiabatic theorem for degenerate states proved in @xcite and to a higher order in @xcite , we know that the @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ dcs ] ) will not change during the arbitrary slow evolution of @xmath71 and @xmath72 . also because the berry s connections of @xmath71 and @xmath72 are abelian",
    ", @xmath40 s will gain a berry s phase factor , which is the same of all @xmath34 , after an adiabatic evolution in the @xmath71-@xmath72 plane .",
    "the berry s phase is @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the path of the adiabatic evolution of @xmath75 in @xmath71-@xmath72 plane and @xmath76 is the area of @xmath74 .",
    "this result appeared in @xcite for non - degenerate coherent states .",
    "the result is also the same as the phase in the paper @xcite .",
    "however , in our case it is the moving magnetic flux that moves the electron instead of a moving potential well .    with the interpretation in the above section",
    ", we can see from eq .",
    "( [ x1 ] ) that when the magnetic flux circles the electron for one loop , the @xmath75 will also enclose an area , and this gives the berry s phase .",
    "for example , we let @xmath46 moves around the origin in a circle with the radius @xmath77 for one loop",
    ". the berry s phase will be @xmath78 this can be viewed as an alternative version of the ab effect .",
    "the different between them is that we move the magnetic flux instead of the electron .",
    "one may see from eq .",
    "( [ me3 ] ) that @xmath79 is non - abelian , so the change of @xmath0 will give non - abelian berry s phase . as the non - abelian berry s phase in such a system has not been shown in the literature before , in the following we would like to give a simple examples to illustrate it .",
    "we assume @xmath80 during the evolution and the other two parameters undergo the loop in fig .",

    "we can get the eigenvalues of matrix @xmath81 as @xmath82 and the corresponding eigenstates @xmath83 .",

    "[ loopfig ] , the state may become @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the area enclosed by @xmath72 and @xmath87 as in fig .",
    "[ loopfig ] .",
