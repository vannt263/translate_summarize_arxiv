    "numerous new physics ( np ) scenarios , candidates as solutions of standard model ( sm ) conceptual problems , are characterized by novel interactions mediated by exchanges of very heavy states with mass scales significantly greater than the electroweak scale . in many cases , theoretical considerations as well as current experimental constraints",
    "indicate that the new objects may be too heavy to be directly produced even at the highest energies of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and at foreseen future colliders , such as the @xmath2 international linear collider ( ilc ) . in this situation",
    "the new , non - standard , interactions would only be revealed by indirect , virtual , effects manifesting themselves as deviations from the predictions of the sm . in the case of indirect discovery",
    "the effects may be subtle since many different np scenarios may lead to very similar experimental signatures and they may easily be confused in certain regions of the parameter space for each class of models .    at the available energies provided by the accelerators , where we study reactions among the familiar sm particles , effective contact interaction lagrangians represent a convenient theoretical tool to physically parameterize the effects of the above - mentioned non - standard interactions and , in particular , to test the corresponding virtual high - mass exchanges .",
    "there are many very different np scenarios that predict new particle exchanges which can lead to contact interactions ( ci ) which may show up below direct production thresholds .",
    "these are compositeness @xcite , a @xmath3 boson from models with an extended gauge sector @xcite , scalar or vector leptoquarks @xcite , @xmath1-parity violating sneutrino ( @xmath4 ) exchange @xcite , bi - lepton boson exchanges @xcite , anomalous gauge boson couplings ( agc ) @xcite , virtual kaluza ",
    "klein ( kk ) graviton exchange in the context of gravity propagating in large extra dimensions , exchange of kk gauge boson towers or string excitations @xcite , _ etc .",
    "_ of course , this list is not exhaustive , because other kinds of contact interactions may be at play .",
    "if @xmath1-parity is violated it is possible that the exchange of sparticles can contribute significantly to sm processes and may even produce peaks or bumps  @xcite in cross sections if they are kinematically accessible .",
    "below threshold , these new spin-0 exchanges may make their manifestation known via indirect effects on observables ( cross sections and asymmetries ) , including spectacular decays @xcite . here",
    "we will address the question of whether the effects of the exchange of scalar ( spin-0 ) sparticles can be differentiated at linear colliders from those associated with the wide class of other contact interactions mentioned above .",
    "for a sneutrino in an @xmath1-parity - violating theory , we take the basic couplings to leptons and quarks to be given by @xmath5 here , @xmath6 @xmath7 are the left - handed lepton ( quark ) doublet superfields , and @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) are the corresponding left - handed singlet fields . if just the @xmath1-parity violating @xmath10 terms of the superpotential are present it is clear that observables associated with leptonic processes @xmath11 will be affected by the exchange of @xmath4 s in the @xmath12- or @xmath0-channels @xcite . for instance , in the case only one nonzero yukawa coupling is present , @xmath13 s may contribute to , e.g. @xmath14 via @xmath12-channel exchange .",
    "in particular , if @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , or @xmath18 are nonzero , the @xmath19 pair production proceeds via additional @xmath12-channel sneutrino exchange mechanism .",
    "however , if only the product of yukawa , e.g.  @xmath20 , is nonzero the @xmath0-channel @xmath21 exchange would contribute to the @xmath19 pair final state .",

    "<S> numerous non - standard dynamics are described by contact - like effective interactions that can manifest themselves in electron - positron collisions only through deviations of the observables ( cross sections , asymmetries ) from the standard model predictions . if such a deviation were observed , it would be important to identify the actual source among the possible non - standard interactions as many different new physics scenarios may lead to very similar experimental signatures . </S>",
    "<S> we study the possibility of uniquely identifying the indirect effects of @xmath0-channel sneutrino exchange , as predicted by supersymmetric theories with @xmath1-parity violation , against other new physics scenarios in high - energy @xmath2 annihilation into lepton pairs at the international linear collider . </S>",
    "<S> these competitive models are interactions based on gravity in large and in tev - scale extra dimensions , anomalous gauge couplings , @xmath3 vector bosons and compositeness - inspired four - fermion contact interactions . to evaluate the identification </S>",
    "<S> reach on sneutrino exchange , we use as basic observable a double polarization asymmetry , that is particularly suitable to directly test for such @xmath0-channel sneutrino exchange effects in the data analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the availability of both beams being polarized plays a crucial rle in identifying the new physics scenario . </S>"
