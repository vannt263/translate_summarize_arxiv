    "the most popular type of dark matter ( dm ) candidate , the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , can naturally reproduce the observed dm abundance due to effective self - annihilation in the early universe , and today this same annihilation process could produce an observable contribution to the measured cosmic - ray fluxes on earth .",
    "such an indirect detection of dm is also possible if dm _ decays _ with a sufficiently large rate .",
    "there exist a number of interesting dm models ( see _ e.g. _  @xcite and references therein ) that predict the decay of dm on cosmological time scales , namely with lifetimes around and above @xmath1 , which are typically required to be not in conflict with current observational limits . among these models",
    "is the gravitino with a small violation of @xmath2-parity , motivated by requiring a consistent thermal history of the universe , and the sterile neutrinos , whose long lifetime is due to tiny yukawa couplings .",
    "the typical masses for these dm candidates lie in the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 regime , respectively . another interesting model with kinetically",
    "mixed hidden gauginos was also recently studied  @xcite . even in models where dm is stable in the first place",
    ", the consideration of higher - dimensional operators often renders the dm particle unstable with cosmological lifetimes .",
    "since the indirect detection signals from decay differ in general from the ones of annihilation , a dedicated study of decaying dm signals is mandatory .",
    "below i will shortly review the @xmath0-ray and @xmath5-signals that can come from dm decay , and i will discuss them in light of recent observations .",
    "provided the decays occur at a sufficiently large rate , their products could be observable as an exotic contribution to the high energy cosmic ray fluxes of @xmath0-rays , electrons , positrons , antiprotons , neutrinos or antideuterons . among the different cosmic - ray species ,",
    "@xmath0-rays play a distinct role , due to their sensitivity to far - distant sources and their potential to discriminate between astrophysical and dm signals .",
    "the _ gamma - ray _ signal from dm decay consists of several components .",
    "the most important one is related to the prompt radiation ( _ e.g. _  final state radiation ) produced in the decay of dm particles inside the milky way halo .",
    "it depends on the halo density profile , and although the halo profile is expected to be approximately isotropic , the corresponding flux at earth exhibits a strong dipole - like anisotropy due to the offset between sun and galactic center .",
    "in contrast , the extragalactic prompt component of the @xmath0-ray signal , which stems from the decay of dm particles at cosmological distances , is largely isotropic . at energies around @xmath6 or below ,",
    "the magnitude of the halo and extragalactic fluxes are of the same order , whereas at much higher energies around @xmath7 the inelastic scattering between @xmath0-rays and the intergalactic background light renders the extragalactic component negligible .",
    "decaying dm in general also produces electrons and positrons , which give rise to another contribution of the @xmath0-ray signal , coming from the inverse compton scattering ( ics ) between the electrons and positrons and the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "this component is highly anisotropic and usually lower in energy than the component from prompt radiation .",
    "the main background in the @xmath0-ray channel is the diffuse emission of our galaxy , which is mainly due to interactions of cosmic rays with the galactic gas and the isrf .",
    "this component is by far strongest in the galactic disk region , and it turns out that exotic fluxes from dm decay would dominantly show up at higher latitudes , away from the disk .",
    "this is in contrast to annihilation signals , which are often expected to be best seen very near to the galactic center .",
    "the _ electrons and positrons _ produced in the milky way halo by dm decay scatter on irregularities of the galactic magnetic field , which results in a wash - out of directional information before they reach the earth .",
    "their propagation is commonly described by a diffusion model , whose free parameters are tuned to reproduce the observed cosmic - ray nuclei fluxes . the astrophysical background in this channel in mainly due to primary electrons , which are presumably produced in supernova remnants , and due to secondary positrons , produced in the interaction of cosmic - rays with the galactic gas .",
    "recently it has become apparent that state - of - the - art propagation models fail to reproduce the pamela measurements of the _ positron fraction _ at energies larger than @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "together with the more recent fermi lat and hess data @xcite for the total @xmath5-flux the experiments suggest an excess of electrons and positrons up to energies around a few @xmath7 .",
    "the most common astrophysical explanation of this excesses is the electron - positron pair production by the interactions of high - energy photons in the strong magnetic field of nearby pulsars , such as geminga or monogem ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite and references therein )",
    ". however , an arguably more exciting explanation of the cosmic - ray electron / positron excesses is the possibility that the electrons and positrons are produced in the annihilation or the decay of dm particles .",
    "r8 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if the observed excess of positrons and electrons is entirely due to dm decay , one obtains clear predictions for the @xmath0-ray signal that should be observable at fermi lat . in ref .",
    "@xcite we analyzed the predictions for the positron fraction and the total electron plus positron flux including a possible contribution from dm decay in order to account for the anomalies observed by pamela and fermi .",
    "we considered several scenarios of decaying dm , being it either a fermionic or a bosonic particle , which decays into various channels with a branching ratio of 100% .",
    "our results are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : results ] , an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mumunu ] . from the data leptonic , and",
    "in particular muonic , modes are favored .",
    "note that the decay into @xmath8 is in some tension with the anti - proton / proton ratio observed by pamela .",
    "+     ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : results ] ) .",

    "details are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    -ray signal for the decay mode @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the _ solid _ line shows the anisotropy of the total signal , including the galactic foreground , the _ dotted _ line shows the anisotropy of the foreground alone .",
    "the _ thin dashed _ line is the anisotropy of the total signal when neglecting ics radiation of electrons and positrons from dm decay . _",
    "right panel : _ averaged fluxes of the different @xmath0-ray components .",
    "line coding as in left panel , in addition the _ thin solid _ line shows the pure dm signal and the _ dot - dashed _ lines show the adopted extragalactic background flux and the galactic foreground .",
    "data points correspond to the preliminary fermi lat results for the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background  @xcite . ]",
    "the production of electrons and positrons in the dm decay inevitably produces also contributions to the cosmic @xmath0-rays .",
    "in particular the @xmath0-ray signal of the decay modes shown in tab .  [ tab : results ] should give rise to a clear signal in the fermi lat observations at higher latitudes .",
    "furthermore this signal is expected to be anisotropic , which can be used to discriminate it from the galactic foreground and the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background . to illustrate this we define the anisotropy parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the diffuse @xmath0-ray flux averaged over the hemisphere in direction of the galactic center ( gc ) and anticenter ( gac ) , respectively .",
    "the galactic disk , with latitudes @xmath13 , is excluded form the average .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : ani ] shows our results for the anisotropy parameter which is expected to be observed by the fermi lat if the dm particle decays into @xmath14 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "although the decay channel is marginally consistent with preliminary data ( right panel ) , a sizeable anisotropy , around @xmath15 , is predicted at energies @xmath16 . this can be significantly different from the anisotropy of the astrophysical foreground ( we adopt the conventional model ` 44_500180 ` from ` galprop.stanford.edu ` ) . as indicated by our estimates of the statistical error bars for one - year and five - year fermi lat observation",
    ", this deviation should be clearly visible in the upcoming results for the diffuse @xmath0-ray sky .",
    "many theoretical models predict the decay of dm on cosmological timescales , giving rise to an anomalous contribution to the observed cosmic - ray fluxes . the corresponding @xmath0-ray signals could show up as broad features over large angular distance in the @xmath0-ray sky .",
    "if decaying dm is the right explanation of the positron and electron excess observed by pamela and fermi lat , a corresponding @xmath0-ray signal with a large dipole - like anisotropy should be observed in the very near future with fermi lat .",
    "this anisotropy would be due to prompt radiation at high latitudes , and due to ics radiation at lower latitudes , most prominent in a region of a few kpc around the galactic center .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that such an ics signal already showed up in the fermi lat data , see ref .",
