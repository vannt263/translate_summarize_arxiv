    "a rich history exists in the field of elliptical galaxy spectrochemical evolution .",
    "it was recognised early on ( @xcite ) that if star formation was to proceed to completion in all ellipticals , then the observed trend of average metallicity with the depth of the galactic potential well ( mass - metallicity relationship ) ( @xcite ) would be difficult to establish .",
    "the key to understanding this observed correlation was provided by mathews & baker ( 1971 ) but not fully appreciated until larson ( 1974b ) .",
    "mathews & baker ( 1971 ) postulated that much of the gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) of ellipticals had been strongly heated by supernovae ( sne ) and driven out by a hot galactic wind once the gas thermal energy exceeded that of its gravitational binding energy ( at some time @xmath0 ) , thereby bringing to a halt the bulk of active star formation .",
    "larson ( 1974b ) noted that the binding energy per unit mass of gas is higher in the more massive galaxies , and thus these systems would retain their gas for a longer period of time before reaching @xmath0 , and thus attain a higher metallicity , consistent with the observed mass - metallicity relationship .",
    "the subsequent evolution would then be regulated only by gas lost from dying stars",
    ". an excellent recent review of galactic winds , from an observational slant , is given by bland - hawthorn ( 1995 ) .",
    "what began with larson ( 1974b ) has led to a profusion of follow - up sne - driven galactic wind models ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ( ay87 ) ; @xcite ( mt87 ) ; @xcite ( ag90 ) ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "modern advances in stellar nucleosynthesis , supernova remnant ( snr ) shock dynamics and thermal evolution , the role of dark matter , and even basic observational constraints ( both in the stellar component of ellipticals and the intracluster medium ( icm ) of galaxy clusters ) makes a re - examination of the classic wind model a timely one .",
    "we have developed a software package , entitled * megaw*@xmath1*m*etallicity * e*volution with * ga*lactic * w*inds , to enable us to study the chemical evolution of ellipticals within the framework of larson ( 1974b ) classic galactic wind model .",
    "concurrent to the development of sophisticated wind models was the flourishing field of spectral and photometric evolution of galaxies , the early history being traced in tinsley s ( 1980 ) seminal paper .",
    "one need only look to the recent models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) , bressan ( 1994 ) , worthey ( 1994 ) and einsel ( 1995 ) , for a few state of the art examples .",
    "the consideration of chemical evolution together with photometric evolution is imperative as stellar evolutionary tracks and spectrophotometric calibrations are sensitive to the chemical composition , and elliptical galaxies are complex systems with a distribution of stellar populations .",
    "models which utilise only solar abundance tracks and solar abundance spectra / colours ( @xcite ; @xcite ) fail to explain the observed correlation between the integrated colours and absolute magnitude of ellipticals ( @xcite ; @xcite ) ( as well as , obviously , the metallicity - luminosity relationship ) .    before embarking upon the construction of a photo - chemical evolution code suitable for both the elliptical galaxies in question and icm abundances",

    "ellipticals , in general , show increasing metallicity and redder colours , with increasing luminosity . * _ magnesium overabundance in stellar populations : _ [ mg / fe ] in giant ellipticals is @xmath2 , with a slight trend toward increasing values with increasing luminosity , albeit with a fairly large degree of scatter ( @xcite ) .",

    "[ tbl : imf_tbl ] is that the galactic wind time @xmath0 ( column 3 ) is not particularly sensitive to the imf , _ provided the star formation efficiency @xmath133 is kept constant ( @xmath164 gyr@xmath165 ) , with @xmath0 ranging from @xmath166 gyr .",
    "_    a secondary point of interest can be inferred from the s55 and ay87 entries to the model b@xmath140 section of table [ tbl : imf_tbl ] .",
    "one might naively expect that the flatter imf ( ay87 ) would _ always lead to an earlier wind time because of its greater proportion of type ii sne , whereas we found that @xmath0 occurred @xmath167% later for the flatter ay87 imf .",
    "this somewhat surprising behaviour can be traced to the metallicity dependence of the sn shell cooling time and ism merging time ( section [ ingredsnr ] ) in cioffi s ( 1988 ) evolutionary formalism .",
    "metallicity terms were not considered by cox ( 1972 ) and chevalier ( 1974 ) , which is why this behaviour has not been encountered in previous models ( nor in the model a@xmath134 s55 and ay87 entries to table [ tbl : imf_tbl ] ) , which have _ all been based upon these earlier supernova models .",
    "a detailed analysis of this unexpected behaviour is forthcoming , although a preliminary accounting can be found in gibson ( 1995 ) .",
    "_ _    while @xmath0 may not be overly imf - sensitive , because of the different proportion of low mass stars in the imfs ( those which can effectively lock - up and remove gas from possible subsequent enrichment ) , columns 4 through 6 show graphically that the predicted ejecta s mass and abundance can be . for example , the s86 and ay87 imfs , using snr model a@xmath134 and @xmath164 gyr@xmath165 , lead to almost identical @xmath0 , but the latter model predicts @xmath168 times the gas mass at @xmath0 , and @xmath169 and @xmath90 times the mass of oxygen and iron , respectively .",
    "this last point is an interesting one  recall that [ o / fe]@xmath170 lies in the range @xmath171 ( @xcite )  the models just mentioned lead to ejecta with [ o / fe ] of @xmath172 ( the ay87 imf ) and @xmath173 ( the s86 imf )",
    ". obviously we must fold in a cluster luminosity function before claiming anything , but the fact that one of the imfs leads to ejecta which is almost a full dex outside the observed icm [ o / fe ] should be a clue to the anticipated difficulty in replicating the observations using the steeper imfs , a point which we addressed in gibson & matteucci ( 1997 ) .",
    "this iron overabundance relative to @xmath174-elements in the ejecta of the s86 model is of course due to the decreased significance of the type ii sne in the steeper imfs .",
    "type ia sne play a correspondingly bigger role as the increased binary parameter @xmath26 would suggest . not only does the wind ejecta suffer from this fe enhancement , but the predicted luminosity - weighted [ mg / fe ] of the stellar population has a similar problem .",
    "the observed ratio in giant ellipticals is @xmath150 ( @xcite ) , in line with the ay87 imf predictions of table [ tbl : imf_tbl ] .",
    "the s86 and ktg93 values are in the range @xmath175 , well outside the observations , another argument against steep imfs in ellipticals .",
    "studying the @xmath164 gyr@xmath165 entries in table [ tbl : imf_tbl ] , we can see that cml predictions for the s55 imf match the mean of the observations ( as this is inherent in the template models of section [ template ] ) .",
    "the flatter imf , because of its enhanced enrichment history , by the same @xmath0 , has redder and more metal - rich stellar populations , at the present time .",
    "conversely , the steeper imfs are significantly bluer and metal poor relative to the mean of the observations .",
    "for example , the ktg93 @xmath164 gyr@xmath165 models are @xmath176 mag too blue ( in v - k ) and @xmath177 dex metal - deficient , whereas the ay87 models are @xmath178 mag too red and @xmath179 dex too rich .    to remedy this",
    ", we show a series of models with @xmath133 varied in order to best replicate the present - day photo - chemical properties of the ellipticals .",
    "these models are represented with a @xmath180 in column 1 of table [ tbl : imf_tbl ] . for the flatter ay87 imf , this means increasing @xmath133 by a factor of four to five , leading to a much earlier wind ( @xmath181 gyr as opposed to @xmath182 gyr ) . with the earlier wind comes @xmath183 times the mass of gas ejected at @xmath0 , and a more extreme [ o / fe]@xmath184 .",
    "an even more important result is found when we look at the attempt to match the ktg93 and s86 imf models with the observations .",

    "even reducing @xmath133 by factors of four to five could only redden the colours by @xmath177 mag , which is still @xmath177 mag blueward of the mean .",
    "by this point the wind epoch has shifted to @xmath185 gyr , which for the assumed cosmology would imply active observable star formation ( @xmath186 m@xmath12/yr ) at redshifts @xmath187 , contrary to observations ( @xcite ) . by this time",
    "the [ mg / fe ] of the stellar population has been decreased from an already untenable @xmath188 , to @xmath189 , even further removed from the observed overabundance of magnesium relative to iron .",
    "we havent shown the s86 predictions as they are even worse than the ktg93 ones .",
    "this is an important result , and one which can not be remedied within the closed - box formalism for chemical evolution currently adopted in * megaw*. for these steep imfs , the metallicity increases slowly because of the lack of high mass stars in the imf ( at least , `` slower '' than for the s55 and ay87 imfs ) . because of this lack of super metal rich stars ( compared to that seen with the flatter imfs ) , all the stars formed with z=0.0 ( all those formed prior to the first sne explosions ",
    "@xmath190 gyr ) tend to `` pull '' the colours / metallicities too blue / low .",
    "this would seem to indicate that this is partly an artifact of the star formation formalism .",
    "an infall model in which the mass of the gaseous component increases with time according to some accretion timescale ( as opposed to the closed - box model in which all the gas is present and available for star formation at @xmath191 ) may be an appropriate mechanism to `` save '' the steeper imfs ( @xcite ) , although the difficulty in reconciling the [ mg / fe ] may still be problematic .- element overabundances , with respect to iron , in the hot x - ray emitting intracluster gas .",

    "this comes about because of the metallicity dependence in the snr evolution models of cioffi ( 1988 ) , which tends to reduce the effective energy transferred per sn event to the ism ( section [ analimf ] ) .    an improved second version of * megaw * is still under development .",
    "many enhancements to the basic code are currently underway , including most importantly , a full hydrodynamical treatment of the elliptical s evolution ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a 1d - hydro code , based upon thomas ( 1988 ) , with the addition of diffuse dark halos , is being meshed with our photo - chemical evolution code .",
    "coupled with more sophisticated radial star formation history scenarios , we will be exploring the origin and evolution of photo - chemical gradients in ellipticals .",
    "other enhancements for version 2 of * megaw * include a simple multi - phase ism treatment ( @xcite ) , the inclusion of a gas infall term ( @xcite ) , and replacing the photometric evolution module with a full spectral synthesis one .",
    "a number of other minor enhancements were laid out in gibson ( 1995 ) .",
    "subsequent papers in this series will examine the evolution of galaxy cluster icm abundances , damped lyman-@xmath174 systems , and stellar yield compilation differences .",
    "first , and foremost , i would like to thank francesca matteucci for her boundless patience and assistance .",
    "thanks also to stan woosley , norbert langer , and friedel thielemann for providing nucleosynthesis data prior to publication .",
    "frank timmes help during the debugging process is gratefully acknowledged , as is that of guy worthey s .",
    "the consideration shown by the astrophysics department at oxford during my two - year `` sabbatical '' can not be emphasised enough .",
    "nserc , paul hickson , and the university of british columbia , are acknowledged for their respective financial assistance ."
