    "the masses and ages of pre - main sequence stars are commonly determined from their position relative to theoretical tracks of stellar evolution on a color - magnitude diagram .",
    "this method of mass determination is subject not only to uncertainties in the measured luminosity and effective temperature of the star but also to discrepancies among evolutionary models .",
    "these discrepancies arise from differences in atmospheric opacities and theories of interior convection .",
    "currently there are few reliably measured masses for low - mass ( m @xmath5 1 m@xmath3 ) pre - main sequence stars ( simon , dutrey , & guilloteau 2000 ) .",
    "the determination of stellar masses through dynamical techniques provides a test for evolutionary models of young stars .",
    "observations of a resolved binary reveal the projected separation of the system and the position angle of the secondary with respect to the primary . with sufficient orbital coverage , the orbital elements of the system can be computed ( e.g. couteau 1981 ) .",
    "if the distance to the binary system is known , the total mass can also be determined .",
    "the relative orbit of a visual binary alone can not yield the masses of the individual components . to achieve this",
    ", one also has to determine the mass ratio , either by observing the motion of the components around their center of mass or by measuring their radial velocities relative to the center of mass velocity .    in this paper",
    "we present new positional measurements for two classical t tauri binary systems df tau and zz tau and the hierarchical triple elias 12 , all located in the taurus star - forming region .",
    "most of the measurements we report here were taken with the fine guidance sensors on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and are a continuation of the program described in simon , holfeltz , & taff ( 1996 ) . the close pair in elias 12",
    "was also observed with adaptive optics on the keck ii telescope .",

    "( 1995 ) and tamazian et al .",
    "( 2002 ) estimate the orbital parameters for df tau .",
    "we performed preliminary orbital calculations for df tau and zz tau , and find that we have not yet observed enough of an orbit for these systems to determine the orbital parameters precisely .",
    "however , although the range of probable values for the parameters is large , the relation between the period and semi - major axis , through kepler s third law , limits the total mass of these systems with sufficient precision as to be useful .",
    "the fine guidance sensors ( fgs ) are a set of three optical interferometers on board the hst ( nelan & makidon 2001 ) .",
    "each fgs consists of a pair of koesters prisms that detect the tilt of the incoming wavefront in two orthogonal directions .",
    "the photon counts are measured by pairs of photomultipliers with an s-20 response . the normalized difference between the intensities of the two beams emerging from each prism , as a function of the tilt of the incoming wavefront , produces the interferometric fringe pattern of the target , also known as the fgs transfer function .",
    "the interferometric response of a binary system is the linear superposition of two single star transfer functions , scaled by the relative brightness of the components and shifted according to their separation on the sky .",
    "the transfer function of a binary can be deconvolved by modeling the system with the observation an unresolved single star .",
    "the shape of the fringe pattern depends on the color of the target . therefore , we use the fgs single star calibrators sao 185689 and hd 233877 , whose colors closely match those of df tau , zz tau , and elias 12 ( listed in table 1 ) . to model the fgs observations of binaries we followed a least - squares approach of searching through a grid of separations and brightness ratios for the components ( lattanzi et al .",
    "1992 ) and finding the minimum in the @xmath6 surface .",
    "the software we developed to analyze triples follows the same method , but over grids of separation and brightness ratios for three stars . the separations and their uncertainties derived from our program , when applied to binary systems , are consistent with those obtained using the software at the space telescope science institute .",
    "the refurbished fgs1r was installed during the hst servicing mission of 1997 and later became the preferred science instrument because of its improved angular resolution ( nelan & makidon 2001 ) . the fgs observations taken before june 1999 were measured with fgs3 ( e.g. holfeltz et al . 1995 ) with the pupil filter .",
    "following this date , the targets were observed with fgs1r with the f583w filter and the fgs in its high angular resolution transfer mode .",
    "each observation of the target was obtained during one hst orbit and was composed of multiple ( @xmath710 ) interferometric scans .",
    "scan lengths of 1.0@xmath8 to 1.5@xmath8 were used to measure the fgs baseline on either side of the binary .",
    "the x and y scans were each cross - correlated , co - added , and smoothed by piecewise polynomial fits to retain the interferometric signal but remove the statistical noise of counting photons .",
    "figure 1 shows these steps in processing applied to zz tau as observed along the x - axis of the fgs on 6 december 2002 .",
    "table 1 lists our most recent fgs measurements for df tau , zz tau , and elias 12 .",

    "this discrepancy in the identification of the primary may be attributable to the spectral energy distributions of the components as well as to the variability of the system .",

    "for the purpose of computing the orbital parameters , we add 180@xmath1 to these position angle measurements .",
    "all of the observations of zz tau prior to 1997.71 had projected separations along the x - axis of the fgs that were smaller than 20 milliarcseconds ( mas ) .",
    "measuring separations this small with fgs3 was not reliable , therefore we determined the position of the binary system from the y - axis measurements of consecutive observations . assuming that the stars have not moved significantly between pairs of observations and since the orientation of the y - axis was sufficiently different from one observation to the next , we solved for the ( x , y ) position at the intermediate date , halfway between the observations .",
    "the reported observation on 1995.08 is a combination of the measured y - axis separations on 1994.93 and 1995.23 .",
    "likewise , the 1996.12 results were obtained by merging the observations on 1995.99 , 1996.15 , and 1996.24 .",
    "the average orbital motion of @xmath0 9 mas / year for subsequent reliable observations justifies the assumption that the stars have not moved significantly between the dates used to calculate the effective points .",
    "moreover , these effective points are consistent with the later fgs1r data .",
    "the v - band magnitude of a target observed with the fgs is given by @xmath9 where c is the sum of the counts ( per 25 msec ) detected by the photomultipliers along the orthogonal x and y axes and @xmath10 is the color index of the target . for the fgs3 with the pupil filter , the calibration coefficients are @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( holfeltz et al .",

    ", we use a value of @xmath13 for the system , which is the average color of the northern and southern components .",
    "the imprecision of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 coefficients for fgs3 contributes to a systematic uncertainty of @xmath00.5 mag in the v - band for a typical value of @xmath10 = 1.5 mag .",
    "the photometric calibration for fgs1r is also subject to similar systematic uncertainties that produce a constant offset in the magnitude at a specified @xmath10 .",
    "to avoid an artificial jump in the magnitude measured by the old and new fgs , we applied an offset to the fgs1r results for each system , so that the average magnitudes of the non - varying components are in agreement with the earlier results obtained with fgs3 .",
    "the fgs magnitude errors reported in table 1 correspond to c@xmath16 counting statistics and do not include the systematic uncertainty in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 coefficients .",
    "the magnitude errors for the close pair in elias 12 also includes the uncertainties in the flux ratio derived from the model fits .",
    "elias 12n was resolved as a close binary through a lunar occultation observation ( simon et al .",
    "this close pair is located @xmath0300 mas away from the primary elias 12s .",
    "since the wide member of the triple system is bright and lies within the isoplanatic patch of the close pair , the primary provides a suitable point - spread function ( psf ) for measuring the separations and flux ratios of the close pair through high resolution imaging .",
    "the hierarchical triple elias 12 was observed with the near - infrared camera nirc-2 at the keck ii telescope using the adaptive optics ( ao ) system ( wizinowich et al .",

    "values for the position angle and separation were read from the interpolating curves to provide a set of position measurements adjusted to implicitly include the time component of the orbital motion .",
    "the apparent orbit was determined from the interpolated data points by performing a least - squares fit to an ellipse ( haralick 1992 ) .",
    "the period , time of periastron passage , and eccentricity ( p , t , e ) were calculated from the geometry of the apparent ellipse ( couteau 1981 ) .",

    "formal errors in the orbital elements are derived using the general matrix method for multiple regression ( bevington & robinson 1992 ) .",
    "these error estimates involve linearizing the equations of orbital motion through a taylor expansion terminated after the first order .",
    "for orbits that are poorly determined , higher order terms may become important .",
    "for such cases , it is necessary to examine the shape of the @xmath6 surface .",

    "the orbital motion of df tau , using the data in table 1 , is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the initial estimates for the orbital parameters of df tau ( p=44 years , t=1982 , e=0.23 ) were obtained through the geometric analysis of the preliminary apparent ellipse .",
    "although these values seemed reliable , we found , upon analysis using the grid search procedure , that the @xmath6 surface is broad and flat in the region of the mimimum .",

    "we have not observed the orbital motion in the close pair , elias 12 na - nb , with sufficient coverage to justify calculating orbital solutions at the current time .",
    "however , over the past three years elias 12nb has moved @xmath050@xmath1 with respect to elias 12na , so a preliminary orbital solution might be possible in the near future .",
    "additionally , elias 12s provides a phase reference to measure the motion of the close pair about their center of mass .",
    "this will provide an estimate of the mass ratio , and hence the individual masses of elias 12 na and nb .",
    "the total mass of a binary is determined by a@xmath31/p@xmath32 , with the semi - major axis on a physical scale .",
    "we use the measurement of the average distance to the taurus cluster , d=140 pc , from kenyon , dobrzycka , & hartmann ( 1994 ) to convert the angular separation to a physical length .",
    "figure 8 shows the distribution of possible values for the total mass , m@xmath33 = ( a@xmath31/p@xmath32)(d/140pc)@xmath31 m@xmath3 , for df tau .",
    "the individual values were obtained by searching for orbital solutions , within @xmath29 from the minimum @xmath6 , across the broad range of permitted periods for each system , eccentricities from 0.0 to 0.9 , and times of periastron passage between 1900 - 2100 .",
    "we also required that the total mass of the system be less than 4 m@xmath3 since masses this large would clearly not be representative of the spectral types and luminosities of the stars observed within the taurus star - forming region .",
    "this condition eliminated highly eccentric , short period systems from the sample of possible solutions .",
    "although the observations allow a broad range of orbital parameters , figure 8 shows that the total mass of df tau is well - defined at m@xmath33 = ( 0.90@xmath2)(d/140pc)@xmath31 m@xmath3 .",
    "since the mass distribution is asymetrical , the reported value for the system mass was calculated using the median of the distribution .",

    "the result that poorly determined orbits can still produce useful values for the total mass is also noted by eggen ( 1967 ) and hartkopf & mason ( 2002 ) .",
    "the system mass is determined by the instantaneous radial acceleration and separation of the stars . although the complete orbit may not be well - determined",

    "the expected improvement in the total mass estimate , over the next 5 years , for df tau is shown in figure 8 .",
