    "during the last decades quasi - two - dimensional electron systems have been of considerable interest because of technological relevance to high - mobility electronic devices .",
    "many authors have investigated q2d systems applying various methods @xcite and most of the theoretical calculations have been performed in the framework of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "however , it is well - known that the rpa neglects the pauli and coulomb hole surrounding each particle and is not satisfactory approximation at low densities @xcite",
    ". therefore a number of authors have studied beyond - rpa effects by including the static lff such as in the singwi - tosi - land - sjlander ( stls ) approach @xcite .",
    "a common viewpoint is the need to incorporate dynamic correlations and the importance of dynamic lff is evidence .",
    "the dynamic lff has been introduced in several works via different schemes @xcite .",
    "one of these works is that of hasegawa and shimizu using the wigner distribution function @xcite . the approach is usually named as the quantum stls and has been applied to 2d el by moudgil and coworkers @xcite .",
    "their calculations have been generalized in our recent work @xcite to the more realistic case of electrons in q2d semiconducting heterostructures investigated by bulutay and tomak ( bt ) @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to extend our previous investigations to include both electron and spin correlations .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss briefly the theoretical formalism of the self - consistent qstls equations applied to the q2d el in gaas / al@xmath2ga@xmath3as heterojunctions based on the variational approach proposed by bastard @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii the results and discussion are given , and in sec .",
    "iv we summarize the main results and gather our assessment of the performance of the qstls for semiconductor heterostructures .",
    "we consider a gaas / al@xmath2ga@xmath3as heterojunction where the electrons move into the gaas side and form 2d subbands . for an accurate account of the electronic distribution we use bastard s variational",
