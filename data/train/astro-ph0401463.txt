    "the frequent association of flat or inverted radio spectra with the parsec - scale knots in the jets of luminous active galactic nuclei ( agn ; bl lacertae objects and quasars ) is commonly interpreted in terms of synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ) effects .",
    "a combination of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) measurements of the angular size and flux density near the frequency of ssa , with the x - ray flux density expected from synchrotron self - compton scattering , then yields the values of the magnetic field , @xmath2 , and the doppler factor , @xmath3 $ ] , for the knots , where @xmath4 is the bulk lorentz factor and @xmath5 is the viewing angle to the axis of the flow ; @xmath1 has a maximum value equal to 2@xmath4 ( e.g. , marscher 1987 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "evidence for spectral flattening at lower radio frequencies , possibly attributable to free - free absorption in the nuclear region , has also been discussed in the context of a few superluminal agn ( e.g. , matveyenko et al .",
    "1980 ; britzen et al .",
    "2001 ; kellermann 2003 , and references therein ) .    here",
    "we point out that a significant spectral flattening of the superluminal radio knots could also arise from a low - energy cut - off ( lec ) of the relativistic electron population and , within a plausible range of parameters for some vlbi components , this can mimic ssa even in spectral regions that are essentially free from ssa .",
    "the resulting extra attenuations of the radio flux and apparent brightness temperature may have interesting implications , and seem to provide useful clues to some observational trends revealed by recent vlbi surveys , which are briefly pointed out below .",
    "from the basic theory of synchrotron emission it is well known that an energy distribution of relativistic electrons truncated at low energies gives rise to a spectral turnover toward lower frequencies , attaining a spectral index @xmath6 ( defined so that the flux density , @xmath7 ) ( e.g. ginzburg & syrovatskii 1969 ; pacholczyk 1970 ) . in the rest frame of the emitting region",
    "this cutoff frequency , @xmath8 , where @xmath9(hz ) = @xmath10 , where @xmath2 is in units of gauss , @xmath11 , in ergs , is the lec for the electron distribution , and @xmath12 is the mean pitch angle of the electrons with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "if we assume a nearly isotropic distribution of electrons in the rest frame of the emitting region , we find that the spectrum turns over below an observed frequency @xmath13 with @xmath14 the cosmological redshift of the agn .",
    "a few rare examples for which hints of such a low - frequency spectral turnover have been reported include the hot spots of the bright radio galaxy cyg a , from which @xmath15 has been inferred ( biermann , strom & falcke 1995 ) .",
    "similar values ( @xmath16 ) have been inferred by @xcite for cyg a and by @xcite for 3c 196 ; leahy , muxlow & stephens ( 1989 ) give indications of a lec in other hot spots .",
    "however , hot spot evidence for a lec remains weak , mainly because one really needs flux measurements with arcsecond resolution well below the turnover frequency @xmath17 200 mhz .",
    "given the practical difficulty of obtaining detailed images at such low frequencies , we explore here the possibility of investigating this phenomenon using the radio knots in agn jets whose apparent superluminal motion can push the spectral turnover peak due to lec ( near @xmath18 ) into the readily accessible centimeter / millimeter waveband .",
    "it may thus become much more feasible to trace the observational signatures of lec .",
    "clearly , any such evidence would hold vital clues to the particle acceleration mechanism in agn and also shed some light on other basic questions concerning the energetics of the agn jets .",
    "probably the most secure example of a mildly inverted radio spectrum arising from lec is the nuclear source of our own galaxy , sgr a@xmath19 , whose radio spectrum has a slope close to @xmath6 .",
    "this has been interpreted in terms of a quasi mono - energetic distribution of the radiating electron population , peaked near 10@xmath20 mev ( duschl & lesch 1994 ; beckert & duschl 1997 ; falcke , mannheim & biermann 1993 ) .",
    "one specific proposal that yields such a lec invokes hadronic interactions near the inner edge of the accretion disk around a rapidly spinning central black hole where it connects to the jet ( falcke , malkan & biermann 1995 ; donea & biermann 1996 ) .",
    "this mechanism produces a pair plasma embedded in a normal plasma ; the lec would correspond to the pion mass , at least near the zone of creation , subject to adiabatic losses and reacceleration along the jet .    in the context of blazars , an early hint for lec ( with @xmath21 mev ) came from the observed lack of faraday depolarization in the vlbi emission regions ( wardle 1977 ; jones & odell 1977 ) .",
    "interestingly , this value of @xmath22 is also the typical energy of electrons radiating near the self - absorption frequency ( e.g. , celotti & fabian 1993 ) .",
    "@xcite argue that synchrotron emission in vlbi scale jets may well arise from @xmath23 pairs and obtain a good fit , taking a lec of around 50 mev .",
    "@xcite conversely argue that energetics constraints indicate that radio jets are ` heavy ' and are composed of protons and electrons , but they still need to invoke a lec .",
    "each of these arguments is model - dependent , and the value of @xmath22 is yet to be firmly established .",
    "likewise , the mechanism responsible for a lec remains to be understood .",
    "it was argued long ago @xcite that the existence of a lec favors models in which radiating relativistic particles are accelerated in relativistic blasts ( e.g. , blandford & mckee 1976 ) or by strong electromagnetic acceleration ( e.g. , lovelace 1976 ) , rather than through stochastic acceleration , since the latter mechanism should produce many electrons with only modestly relativistic lorentz factors .",
    "but neither of these approaches naturally produces a lec around 50100 mev .",
    "the arguments presented here are quite independent of the specific mechanism for a lec .    for a homogeneous , spherical source of incoherent synchrotron emission ssa",
    "leads to a rather sharp spectral turnover near a frequency ( e.g. , ginzburg & syrovatskii 1969 ; kellermann & pauliny - toth 1969 ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the peak flux density ( in units of janskys ) of the knot , observed at @xmath26 , @xmath27 ( in milli - arcseconds ) is its angular size at @xmath26 , @xmath2 is in units of gauss , and @xmath28 is the co - moving doppler factor of the knot .    from eq ( 1 ) and eq ( 2 ) we get @xmath29 here @xmath30 is a measure of the apparent surface brightness , and @xmath31 .",
    "the critical doppler factor for which @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 if @xmath34 then lec is important for flux attenuation .",
    "although our picture of the knots is admittedly oversimplified , as any gradients in the lec could complicate the analysis , it should suffice to illustrate the relevance of lec induced spectral effects .",
    "clearly , for the knots with @xmath35 , the onset of ( a mild ) spectral turnover toward lower frequencies will be led by lec , not ssa .",
    "thus , the larger the value of @xmath36 , the greater would be the suppression of the peak flux that would have otherwise been attained by the knot , provided the limiting factor were indeed ssa . considering the mildly positive slope ( @xmath37 ) at @xmath38 and a typical spectral index @xmath39 in the unabsorbed / uncutoff part of the spectrum , the flux suppression factor measured at @xmath26 is @xmath40 .",
    "the source parameters on which @xmath36 and @xmath41 depend include the magnetic field in the vlbi knot , for which estimates are rather model dependent .",
    "for the radio jets up to distances of @xmath42 pc from the core , @xmath2 = 0.1  0.3 g has been estimated from independent analyses of the detailed vlbi observations ( lobanov 1998 ; piner et al .",
    "somewhat higher values have been adopted by @xcite in their modeling of the superluminal cores .",
    "we adopt @xmath43 g as a fiducial value , but consider the plausible range below .",
    "as noted above , most observations and models give values of @xmath44 , so we take 1 as its fiducial value .    the other important physical parameter in eqs ( 3 ) and",
    "( 4 ) is the surface brightness , @xmath45 .",
    "a recent data set relevant to this quantity is based on 15 ghz very long baseline arrary ( vlba ) imaging of 160 flat - spectrum sources ( kellermann et al .",
    "1998 ; zensus et al .  2002 ) .",
    "these observations , with baselines out to 440 million wavelengths ( with angular resolution , @xmath46 mas ) have shown that @xmath4790% of the sources have an unresolved flux density greater than @xmath48 jy ( i.e. , @xmath49 ) , whereas @xmath4745% of the sources have unresolved structures stronger than 0.5 jy ( i.e. , @xmath50 ) @xcite .",
    "there is presently little evidence in the vlbi samples for a sizable population of agn having @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "this is further corroborated by the ongoing space vlbi survey of compact agn , using the vlbi space observatory programme @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation for the lack of extremely high values of @xmath45 ( @xmath52 ) is that such extreme objects will form rarely to begin with , and that any such components would be very strongly self - absorbed at typical vlbi frequencies , and therefore relativistic beaming would be much less effective for flux boosting ( see kellermann 1994 ) .",
    "thus , we shall adopt here @xmath53 . taking @xmath43 g , and @xmath54 ( see above ) , we then have from eq ( 4 ) , @xmath55 = @xmath56 , where @xmath57 2 , 4 , and 9 , for @xmath45 = 3 , 30 , and 300 , respectively , a range that includes the vast majority of the bright vlbi knots .",
    "evidently , for many radio emission regions close to the nucleus , lec induced flux suppression is expected to set in already at frequencies that are too high for ssa to be significant , even if the knots are only modestly superluminal .",
    "but the same lec dominance would require larger doppler factors in the case of knots having higher surface brightnesses and/or redshifts .",
    "1 illustrates the variation of @xmath18 and @xmath26 across the @xmath58 ",
    "@xmath59 plane , for the plausible ranges of @xmath45 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to note that for most values of @xmath59 ( i.e. , @xmath60 ) , @xmath18 lies above the typical frequency range of vlbi observations ( 5  15 ghz ) if @xmath61 g , and hence these observations are usually made below the spectral turnover due to lec ( although the spectral turnover due to ssa is yet to set in for most of the knots ) . for the brighter , albeit comparatively rare , knots with @xmath62 , the typical range of vlbi frequencies would always lie within the ssa - dominated regime , for practically the entire plausible range of @xmath59 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "in recent years , a few vlbi imaging observations have also been possible at higher frequencies , e.g. , 4386 ghz ( e.g. , krichbaum et al .  2001 ; jorstad & marscher 2003 ) . for such cases ,",
    "the lec - induced spectral flattening would set in for @xmath63 , except for the brightest vlbi knots ( @xmath64 ) which would nonetheless be synchrotron self - absorbed .",
    "thus , it appears that in typical vlbi observations , made at 5 or 15 ghz , most of the emission regions in proximity to the nucleus ( at distances @xmath65 pc , where the brightest and the fastest moving knots are normally expected to be found ) would appear dimmed either from flux suppression due to lec , or alternatively , in the few cases of extreme brightness , due to ssa . as can be seen from fig .  1 and eq ( 3 ) , the flux suppression would increase rapidly with doppler factor ( @xmath1 ) , but its significance would diminish for the knots having lower magnetic field and/or higher redshift , or if the value of @xmath22 were smaller .    an observational consequence of the depression of the peak flux density by a factor @xmath41 (  2 ) , arising from such ( pre - mature ) spectral flattening , would be a reduction in brightness temperatures , @xmath66 , of the vlbi knots , compared to the situation in which ssa alone were significant . for the latter case , @xcite has deduced a realizable limit of @xmath67 k ( assuming equipartition ; also see singal & gopal - krishna 1985 ) , which is about a sixth of the diamagnetic limit calculated by @xcite .",
    "other theoretical limits proposed for @xmath66 are @xmath68 k , arising from catastrophic inverse compton cooling @xcite and greater than @xmath69 k , arising from relativistic induced compton scattering @xcite .",
    "evidence for brightness temperatures being found to typically be lower than these theoretically expected intrinsic brightness temperatures comes from the vlba 2 cm sample of 48 superluminal sources , whose distribution in the ` doppler factor  proper motion ' plane is best fitted by a peak intrinsic @xmath70 k @xcite .",
    "this is roughly half of the equipartition value , and an order of magnitude below the stricter inverse compton scattering limit .",
    "the lec - induced flux suppression could possibly account for the deficit observed vis -  - vis the equipartition value .",
    "note that even though the best - fit value of the intrinsic brightness temperatures found by @xcite , is just a factor of 2  3 below the equipartition temperature limit , it makes a huge difference in the energetics .",
    "the increase in the energies for such reductions in @xmath71 is @xmath72 times @xcite .    to recapitulate , for the typical magnetic field of 0.1 g and usual vlbi observing frequency ( @xmath73 5  15 ghz )",
    ", most radio knots with medium - to - low surface brightness ( @xmath74 ) would suffer a marked suppression of flux density as a result of lec , if @xmath28 exceeds @xmath475 and @xmath75 .",
    "thus , in such vlbi surveys one would expect a deficit of knots with high doppler factors ( and , correspondingly , of high lorentz factors , given the rather tight correspondence expected between the two , cf .",
    "table 1 in jorstad & marscher 2003 ) .",
    "this selection bias would gradually ease for vlbi surveys made at higher frequencies and/or higher @xmath14 ( which corresponds to higher observing frequencies in the rest frame of the sources ) .",
    "interestingly , such statistical trends may indeed be seen in the recent large vlbi surveys .",
    "for instance , for a large sample of flat - spectrum sources , the caltech ",
    "jodrell bank - flat ( cjf ) sample , the measured apparent velocities of the vlbi components at 5 ghz show a positive correlation with redshift ( fig .  1 in vermeulen et al .",
    "2003 ) . while , clearly , this result does not exclude alternative explanations , it is interesting that there is also evidence for a _ statistical _ increase in the apparent velocities of superluminal knots with the frequency of the vlbi measurements , even as the apparent velocity of a given vlbi knot observable at multiple frequencies would be the same at all of those frequencies . as already pointed out by @xcite , the apparent velocities for a cjf sample at 5 ghz are nearly a factor of 2 smaller , on average , than those found in the 15 ghz vlba survey of the same sample @xcite , and these , in turn , are only about half as fast as the velocities found in a vlbi survey of 33 blazars at 22 and 43 ghz by @xcite .",
    "their high frequency survey yielded mean apparent velocity of @xmath4711@xmath76 , ( taking @xmath77 km s@xmath78 mpc@xmath78 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that a decrease in mean apparent velocity with decreasing frequency might result from changing ssa turnovers if these measurements corresponded to an increase in average size or distance from the core .",
    "@xcite have ascribed the higher velocities for their sample to be an intrinsic property of their sources , which are @xmath80-ray emitting blazars . in our scenario , their finding abnormally high velocities for that sample may be directly related to the unusually high observing frequency of their vlbi survey .",
    "one observational test of our hypothesis would be possible by vlbi monitoring of @xmath80-ray blazars at moderate frequencies , say 5 or 10 ghz ; we understand that such data are likely to become available in the near future , making a detailed check possible .",
    "a crisp prediction of our scenario , which can be tested by quasi - simultaneous multi - frequency vlbi , is that the knots affected by lec should have only a weakly inverted spectrum below @xmath18 , with a slope of @xmath81 down to @xmath26 .",
    "the presence of a lec could also have interesting implications for the kiloparsec scale jets of quasars , for which bulk relativistic motion has been inferred recently from x - ray observations ( e.g. , tavecchio et al .",
    "2000 ; celotti , ghisellini & chiaberge 2001 ) .",
    "in such extended jets the photon energy density is dominated by the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) photons , which , after inverse compton collisions with the relativistic jet particles , would be observed at a frequency @xmath82{\\rm hz}$ ] , with @xmath83 the angle between the jet and the observer in the jet s rest frame @xcite .    for a typical @xmath84 , and taking even a fairly modest value of @xmath85 , which is close to the expectation value for @xmath86 ( e.g. , vermeulen & cohen 1994 ; jorstad & marscher 2003 ) , it can be seen that @xmath87 mev translates into a spectral turnover of the inverse compton scattered radiation occurring at energies of a few kev .",
    "thus , for many jets detected with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ telescopes , signatures of the lec may well be present in their x - ray measurements , in the form of suppressed soft x - ray flux , i.e. , a hardened x - ray spectrum .",
    "moreover , one can expect rapid , correlated variations of x - ray flux and spectral slope as @xmath1 changes .",
    "clearly , these effects would be stronger for extended jets with faster bulk motions and/or higher redshifts ; a search for these trends would provide valuable clues .",
    "the flux suppression would render the detection of extended x - ray jets at higher redshifts more difficult , even though the expected surface brightness diminution with @xmath14 is exactly compensated for by the corresponding increase in the cmbr energy density ( see schwartz et al .",
