    "<S> we propose a new and effective means for designing stable and fast - folding polypeptide sequences using a cumulant expansion of the molecular partition function . </S>",
    "<S> this method is unique in that @xmath0 , the `` cumulant design temperature '' entered as a parameter in the design process , is predicted also to be the optimal folding temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the method was tested using monte - carlo folding simulations of the designed sequences , at various folding temperatures @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> ( folding simulations were run on a cubic lattice for computational convenience , but the design process itself is lattice - independent . ) simulations confirmed that , over a wide range of @xmath0 , all designed sequences folded rapidly when @xmath2 . additionally , highly thermostable model proteins were created simply by designing with high @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism proposed in these studies provides a plausible pathway for the evolutionary design of biologically active proteins , which _ must _ fold and remain stable within a relatively narrow range of temperatures .    </S>",
    "<S> the functionality of a protein stems from the molecule s ability to assume one unique shape , the `` native conformation , '' out of an untenable sea of possible conformations . </S>",
    "<S> nature seems to have _ designed _ protein sequences capable of folding into specific conformations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of sequence design is the `` inverse folding '' problem : given a 3-dimensional target structure , predict a sequence of amino acids which will spontaneously fold to that structure , and remain stable with respect to that structure </S>",
    "<S> .    a recent systematic approach to the sequence design problem utilizes the idea of stochastic optimization in sequence space @xcite : one should design sequences with a large energy gap between the native conformation and the set of misfolded , denatured states . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest implementation was based on the approximation that the free energy of the denatured state does not depend on sequence ( only on amino acid composition ) , while the energy of the native state is sequence - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent improvements to this algorithm accounted in a crude way for the dependence of the energy of unfolded conformations on sequence , thus relaxing the condition of fixed amino acid composition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the same approach with minor technical modifications was used in the recent work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> no folding simulations were made to test the sequences designed in this work , however , making it impossible to evaluate the design algorithm of @xcite as well as the applicability of the heteropolymer model used there .    </S>",
    "<S> the serious shortcoming of all previous sequence design methods is the conspicuous lack of reference to a folding temperature @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> stability and foldability are , however , sensitive functions of @xmath1 @xcite . ideally , one would like to design sequences which are foldable within a preimposed , biologically relevant temperature range . </S>",
    "<S> since the stability of the native state is determined by the difference in free energy between the unfolded state and the native state , a realistic treatment of the temperature dependence of the free energy of the denatured state is paramount to any reasonable attempt of `` rational '' protein design .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we report a method of rational sequence design which takes a target structure _ and a desired optimal folding temperature @xmath0 _ , and generates a sequence which is thermodynamically stable with respect to the target structure _ at a folding temperature @xmath3_. ( see figure 1 . ) the method , which we call the `` cumulant design method , '' is based on a mean - field high temperature expansion of the single - molecule partition function , which allows us to estimate the free energy of the denatured state explicitly .    </S>",
    "<S> the energy of a model protein can be evaluated as @xmath4 where @xmath5 if monomers @xmath6 and @xmath7 are within some specified distance range in three - dimensions , and @xmath8 otherwise . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 is the identity of the amino acid at position k , and @xmath10 is the parameter set matrix , a symmetric energy matrix representing the pairwise attraction ( or repulsion ) of the various amino acids . </S>",
    "<S> we use the phenomenological parameter set of miyazawa and jernigan @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the probability of finding a chain in any given state during the folding process is given by the canonical ensemble : @xmath11 where the set @xmath12 represents the positions of the n monomers , @xmath13 represents the amino acid sequence , and @xmath14 explicitly represents the constraints imposed by the chain.@xcite ( we absorb boltzmann s constant @xmath15 into @xmath16 . ) the conformation - space partition function is : @xmath17 it is through the partition function @xmath18 that properties of the unfolded state affect the stability of the native state .    we can rewrite the partition function as an intergral over a continuous density of states : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total number of possible conformations and @xmath21 is the normalized density of energy states . the _ cumulants _ @xmath22 of @xmath21 are defined by @xmath23 solving for @xmath21 and substituting into ( [ continuous_z ] ) yields @xmath24 this is a high - temperature expansion of @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is useful that the cumulants of independent random variables add linearly . thus if we know the cumulants of the energy probability distribution for a _ single contact _ , </S>",
    "<S> the energy cumulants of a system with @xmath26 independent , identically distributed contacts is simply @xmath27    of course , ( [ cumulant_expansion ] ) is useful only if we can estimate the cumulants of @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we make this estimate in the mean - field , by first calculating the set of simple moments @xmath29 of the _ single contact _ </S>",
    "<S> energy @xmath30 : @xmath31 ^{n } } { \\sum_{i , j=1}^{n } p_{ij}}\\ ] ] in our mean - field approximation , monomers @xmath6 and @xmath7 are assumed , during random motion , to interact with a probability @xmath32 , determined by the chain connectivity . </S>",
    "<S> since the correlation length in globules is small @xcite , a good estimate of @xmath32 for the globular , denatured state is the uniform distribution over _ all allowed _ contacts @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( on a cubic lattice , this excludes contacts for which @xmath33 is even . )    </S>",
    "<S> we utilize the high temperature expansion ( [ cumulant_expansion ] ) and the noted properties of cumulants to present the cumulant algorithm for sequence design :    \\1 . </S>",
    "<S> begin with a target structure and a random sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the target structure will remain fixed , as the optimization occurs in sequence space .    </S>",

    "<S> compute the first @xmath34 moments of the single - contact energy ( eq . [ moments ] ) .    </S>",

    "<S> compute the first @xmath34 single - contact cumulants in terms of the first @xmath34 moments , using a known recursion relation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> \\4 . </S>",
    "<S> utilize ( [ single_total ] ) to approximate the cumulants of the total molecular energy . </S>",
    "<S> we used the maximally compact @xmath26 , which was shown computationally to be the optimal choice .    </S>",
    "<S> \\5 . </S>",
    "<S> estimate the partition function using ( [ cumulant_expansion ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the temperature used in ( [ cumulant_expansion ] ) is our cumulant design temperature @xmath0 , which is predicted to be the optimal folding temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> \\6 . </S>",
    "<S> calculate the fitness parameter , the canonical probability of native state occupancy . for convenience , </S>",
    "<S> we actually maximize the quantity @xmath35 which is monotonic with @xmath36 : @xmath37    \\7 . </S>",

    "<S> \\8 . </S>",
    "<S> compute @xmath35 for the mutated sequence , and accept or reject the mutation according to the metroplis algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> one must use a convenient `` sequence space selective temperature '' @xmath38 @xcite to run the simulation ; this is unrelated to the cumulant design temperature @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> \\9 . </S>",
    "<S> continue the monte - carlo search until equilibrium is reached , and @xmath35 is ( approximately ) maximized .    </S>",
    "<S> the lack of an accurate `` energy field '' for real proteins currently prevents us from designing foldable proteins in the laboratory setting , so we must test our design hypothesis within the context of computational models . for simplicity we chose a standard cubic lattice model . under such a model , each monomer is represented as a vertex on a cubic lattice , and two monomers `` interact '' if they are lattice neighbors but do not occupy successive positions on the chain . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that the cumulant design method itself is not beholden to any particular model ; the cubic lattice is used merely to _ test _ the method .    </S>",
    "<S> we designed a number of sequences for different target backbones and with various design temperatures @xmath0 , and tested the thermodynamic and kinetic properties ( stability and folding times , respectively ) of these sequences . for our target ( native ) structures , we used five random , maximally compact 36-mer backbones . </S>",
    "<S> we used several structures in order to make sure that any properties noted are not artifacts of a particular native conformation .    </S>",
    "<S> ten sequences were designed for each of five cumulant design temperatures ( @xmath39 ) , on each of the five random backbones , for a total of 250 designed sequences . </S>",
    "<S> the cumulant expansion was cut off at fifteen terms , enough to infer convergence of the series . </S>",
    "<S> sequences were designed using the aforementioned miyazawa - jernigan parameter set @xcite , and were `` optimal '' in the sense that they maximized @xmath40 within the approximations used .    </S>",
    "<S> we ran @xmath41 folding simulations , at various temperatures , on each of the designed sequences . </S>",
    "<S> the runs were @xmath42 monte - carlo ( mc ) steps in length . </S>",
    "<S> the folding algorithm was that of hilhorst @xcite , utilizing three standard moves : crankshaft , corner flip , and tail moves . </S>",
    "<S> one mc step consisted of one randomly chosen ( sterically possible ) move , whether or not that move was accepted according to the metropolis criterion .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 2 demonstrates that the optimal folding temperature for a sequence is strongly correlated with the the cumulant design temperature @xmath0 for that sequence . </S>",
    "<S> this is true over a factor of two in absolute temperature ; within this range , the minimal folding time occurs for @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the relationship breaks down at high @xmath0 , for reasons that will be discussed subsequently .    </S>",
    "<S> the designed sequences were also tested for stability . </S>",
    "<S> starting from the folded state , sequences were subjected to folding simulations of @xmath43 mc steps . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3 shows clearly that sequences designed with high @xmath0 were more thermostable than sequences designed with low @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> ( we acknowledge that longer runs would be necessary to confirm the stability data at very low @xmath1 . )    the sequences designed by the cumulant algorithm fold at least as rapidly as those designed for maximal gap ( for comparison see e.g. @xcite ) ; the cumulant method could even design fast - folding 64-mers ( median folding time 2.1 million mc steps ) . </S>",
    "<S> most importantly , the cumulant design temperature @xmath0 proved a good predictor of the optimal folding temperature , allowing us to design sequences with specified ( optimal ) @xmath1 .    of particular interest </S>",
    "<S> is the newfound ability to design thermostable sequences . to this end </S>",
    "<S> it is instructive to study which features of sequences are responsible for optimal behavior at high folding temperatures @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> one can keep only two terms in the cumulant expansion to approximate the optimized quantity given by ( [ pz ] ) : @xmath44 ( a similar expression for the partition function of a disordered heteropolymer was obtained in @xcite ) where @xmath45 is the average interaction energy and @xmath46 is its variance . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from ( [ approximate_p ] ) that at low temperature , sequences with minimal dispersion should be selected , perhaps at the expense of compromising low target state energy @xmath47 , while at higher @xmath16 this factor is less important and what is mostly optimized is @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 shows that this is precisely what occurs .    although our algorithm is effective over a factor of two to three in absolute temperature , it is _ not _ generally possible to design sequences which are stable at temperatures outside of this range . </S>",
    "<S> it was effectively impossible to design sequences with @xmath48 , due to divergence of the high - temperature expansion ( [ cumulant_expansion ] ) . at high @xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> design efficacy eroded due to limits on the interaction energies ; no molecule can be stable at temperatures higher than the characteristic @xmath16 of its strongest interactions . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , our assumption of a compact denatured state becomes progressively less accurate as @xmath16 increases .    </S>",
    "<S> any one protein can indeed fold only within a specific thermal environment . </S>",
    "<S> one example is the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the version of this enzyme present in the mesophilic bacterium _ </S>",
    "<S> lactobacillus leichmannii _ is maximally active at @xmath49 , while its counterpart in the thermophile _ </S>",
    "<S> thermus x-1 _ demonstrates maximal activity at about @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the activity curves are narrow : at @xmath51 , the thermophilic enzyme is less that 30% active , and at @xmath52 , the mesophilic homologue is completely inactive . </S>",
    "<S> although it might be impossible to design a single protein which folds at all habitable temperatures , nature has been able to give each organism the proteins it needs to thrive in its own thermal environment .    </S>",
    "<S> our cumulant design method seems to give a reasonable estimate of the molecular partition function : we are able to design model proteins which are stable ( and foldable ! ) at a given temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we thus have a useful model for the thermodynamic properties of real proteins .    </S>",
    "<S> this work was supported by the hertz foundation for the applied physical sciences and the packard foundation . </S>",
    "<S> we are grateful for useful discussions with sharad ramanathan and victor abkevich . </S>"
