    "the collisionless nature and low intrinsic thermal velocities of dark matter ( dm ) particles are two of the fundamental hypotheses underlying the remarkably successful cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm .",
    "the latter of these hypotheses is related to a filtering mass scale that sets the minimum mass for self - bound dm structures ( haloes ) to be typically of @xmath1(1m@xmath2 ) and hence the cdm model predicts the existence of a large population of earth - mass haloes in the local universe .",
    "although such prediction has yet to be unambiguously tested by observations , there is evidence of a potential tension with the actual number of observed dwarf galaxies , both within the milky - way ( mw ) ( the so called  missing satellite problem  , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in the field ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* as inferred from the hi velocity function measured by the alfalfa survey ) .",
    "this challenge to the cdm model is undoubtedly connected to the development of a successful theory of galaxy formation at the scale of dwarfs .",
    "for instance , it has been shown that the combination of astrophysical processes that inhibit star formation are able to solve the `` missing satellite '' problem ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , but the tension with dwarf galaxies in the field remains despite attempts to explain it without modifying the cdm model @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen if galaxy formation models based on n - body simulations that seem to provide a good fit to the luminosity function at low masses @xcite are also successful in reproducing the hi observations of the velocity function .",
    "such a prevailing challenge strengthens the case for a solution based on a suppression of primordial small - scale density fluctuations .",
    "for example , models where dm is `` warm '' , i.e. , where dm particles have larger primordial thermal velocities , are able to alleviate the overabundance problem ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and at the same time , if their masses are @xmath3  kev , avoid current constraints on the matter power spectrum as measured by the lyman@xmath4 forest @xcite .    the second hypothesis , that of dm being essentially collisionless , has also been contested .",
    "the idea of self - interacting dark matter ( sidm ) was first suggested by @xcite nearly 20 years ago . more than a decade ago , @xcite realised that the aforementioned overabundance problem of dwarf galaxies , and the observation of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies having density cores @xcite ( which contradicts the high density cusps predicted by the cdm model @xcite ) could be avoided if dm would be self - interacting .",
    "current observations of lsb galaxies @xcite and mw dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) @xcite seem to confirm the presence of density cores in low - mass haloes .",
    "since these galaxies are dm - dominated , it is challenging to invoke baryonic processes as the main mechanisms responsible of altering so drastically the inner density profile of haloes .",
    "if dm is not cold , then haloes are expected to have cores , although those associated with currently allowed wdm models seem to be too small to explain the observed cores of lsb galaxies @xcite .",
    "haloes within wdm simulations , although less concentrated , seem to have similar profiles as their cdm counterparts and they do not show a clear sign of developing cores ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "high resolution simulations within the wdm cosmogony are however challenging @xcite and hence a consensus on the inner density profile of wdm haloes has not been reached .",
    "sidm models on the other hand , lead naturally to the development of a substantial core as was already shown by the first sidm simulations @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen if sidm models are able to explain the observed cores of mw dsphs and lsb galaxies .",
    "the first sidm models assumed a constant scattering cross section and were quickly abandoned since those that could solve the small - scale cdm problems seemed to violate several astrophysical constraints , such as the observed ellipticity of the mass distribution of galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and the survivability of satellite haloes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "to avoid such constraints , simple ad hoc velocity - dependent cross sections of the form @xmath5 were explored ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , yielding encouraging results that however lacked a proper underlying particle physics model .",
    "it has also been claimed that these velocity - dependent sidm models are not able to solve simultaneously the core problem in dm - dominated systems and the `` missing satellite problem '' ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite proposed that the possible existence of a yukawa potential among dm particles can resolve the challenges facing sidm with a constant cross section .",
    "the velocity dependence of scattering through the massive mediator of this dark force ( similar to a screened coulomb scattering in a plasma ) could make scattering important at the low velocity dispersion of dwarf galaxies but unimportant at the much higher velocities encountered in galaxy clusters .",
    "the possibility of exothermic reactions could in addition introduce a special velocity scale around which the influence of the dm interaction peaks .",
    "the existence of dark forces was studied earlier as a solution to cosmic ray anomalies through enhanced dark matter annihilation @xcite ) .",
    "a recent analysis by @xcite puts forward an additional challenge to the cdm model .",
    "the authors used simulated mw - like haloes in a cdm cosmology to show that the observed mw dsphs are only consistent with inhabiting relatively low - mass cdm subhaloes , leaving a population of more massive subhaloes with no galaxies associated to them , i.e. , massive subhaloes of cdm mw - like haloes seem to be too dense to host the bright mw dsphs . in a recent extension to this analysis",
    ", @xcite showed that this problem is unlikely to be solved invoking standard galaxy formation processes based on cdm .",
    "this is one of the most serious challenges faced by the cdm model and can perhaps be solved by invoking wdm @xcite or , alternatively , also naturally avoided in certain sidm models as we explore in this work .",
    "this is the first paper in a series whose objective is to study the properties of dm ( sub)haloes within allowed velocity - dependent sidm ( vdsidm ) models using state - of - the - art numerical simulations . in this work",
    "we only focus on the recently discovered problem pointed out by @xcite and demonstrate how vdsidm models can reduce the discrepancy between observation and theoretical prediction . in section",
    "[ methods ] we briefly describe the particle physics model we use and present our numerical algorithm including test simulations . in section  [ sims ] we present simulations of a mw - like dark matter halo using the initial conditions of one of the aquarius haloes @xcite and compare its resulting subhalo population , for a couple of representative cases in the parameter space of the vdsidm model , with the ones of the standard collisionless cdm model .",
    "these models are then contrasted against observational data from the mw dsphs in section  [ dsphs ] .",
    "finally a summary and the conclusions of our work are given in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "we use a simplified particle physics model where the self - scattering between dm particles of mass @xmath6 is set by an attractive yukawa potential with coupling strength @xmath7 mediated by a new gauge boson of mass @xmath8 ( either scalar or vector ) in the dark sector .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for details on the particle physics model and its available parameter space .",
    "if we only consider elastic interactions , the scattering problem is analogous to the screened coulomb scattering in a plasma , which is well fitted by a transfer cross section given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the relative velocity of the dm particles .",
    "here @xmath13 is the velocity at which @xmath14 peaks at a transfer cross section equal to @xmath15 .",
    "the value of @xmath16 is constrained by different astrophysical measurements , the most stringent being : i ) the observed ellipsoidal shape of haloes as implied by x - ray data of galaxy clusters and ellipticals @xcite ; ii ) avoidance of the gravothermal catastrophe leading to inner density profiles even steeper than those predicted in cdm @xcite ; and iii ) avoidance of the destruction of subhaloes through collisions with high velocity particles from a larger parent halo @xcite .",
    "there is a summary of these and other constrains in table i of @xcite and in figure  2 of @xcite : on the scales of dwarf galaxies , @xmath17 , the allowed values for the transfer cross section are roughly constrained from above by @xmath18 , and are much lower at @xmath19 , where the constraints are stronger by approximately two orders of magnitude . since we are interested in the possibility of producing cored density profiles for the haloes associated with the mw dsphs , we will take two benchmark points in the @xmath20 parameter space close to the aforementioned constraints that maximise the self - interaction at the typical velocity dispersion of these dwarfs ( see table  [ table : ref_points ] in section [ ic ] below ) .    in this work",
    "we only consider elastic scattering leaving the cases of excited states and their associated exo- and endothermic interactions for a future analysis .      to account for dm self - interactions we follow a standard",
    "monte carlo approach similar to previous implementations @xcite , but different from fluid smoothed particle hydrodynamics approaches as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we determine the scattering probability for every particle @xmath21 with each of its @xmath22 nearest neighbours @xmath23 in a time step @xmath24 by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the simulation particle mass , @xmath27 is the relative velocity between particles @xmath21 and @xmath23 , @xmath28 is the scattering cross section per unit mass described in section [ mod_sec ] , @xmath29 the smoothing length enclosing the @xmath30 nearest neighbours of particle @xmath21 , and @xmath31 is the cubic spline kernel function in 3d normalisation : @xmath32 the time step @xmath24 is chosen small enough to avoid multiple scatterings during a time step by requiring that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the local velocity dispersion at the position of particle @xmath21 calculated based on its @xmath30 neighbours , and we set @xmath35 , which is sufficiently small to avoid multiple scatterings during a step and usually smaller than the time step inferred from the dynamical time scale .",

    "this procedure conserves energy and linear momentum , but not angular momentum .",

    "clearly , the disfavoured refp1 model with a large constant cross section has a very different density distribution with a spherical core in the centre .",
    "substructures also share these properties being less dense and more spherical in this simulation .",
    "the vdsidm models refp2 and refp3 on the other hand can hardly be distinguished from the cdm case ( refp0 ) in this figure .",
    "as we see below , the internal structure of the massive subhaloes does actually change significantly with respect to the cdm case .",
    "we note that the spherical cores in self - interacting models are due to the assumed isotropic scattering process , which tends to isotropise particle orbits leading to a more isotropic and spherical configuration .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : mainhalo_density ] shows the main halo density profiles for the different models . whereas the right panel shows the",
    "mean free path @xmath83 as a function of radius for the sidm models .",

    "although this case is ruled out by current astrophysical constraints ( see section [ mod_sec ] ) , it serves as a reference for the effect of a large scattering cross section at the scales of mw - like haloes in a full cosmological simulation . on the contrary , refp2 and refp3 result in a main halo",
    "whose density profile follows very closely the one from the cdm prediction of refp0 down to @xmath95  kpc from the centre . at smaller radii , where the typical particle velocities are smaller",
    ", self - interaction is large enough to produce a core .",
    "the mean free path radial profile clearly illustrates the radius where collisions are more important for the different sidm models , which is around the core radius .",
    "it also highlights the difference between the refp2 and refp3 models , with the former having a larger core than the latter , because its self - interaction cross section peaks at a larger velocity dispersion ( occurring at larger radii ) despite of having a lower value of @xmath96 .",
    "each simulation particle records the total number of scatter events during its dynamical evolution .",
    "we can use this information to show alternatively the size of the collisional radius by constructing a radial profile of the mean number of scatter events as a function of radius .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : mainhalo_scatter ] for the highest resolution aq - a-3 simulations for refp1 , refp2 and refp3 .",
    "clearly , the large and constant cross - section of refp1 produces a significantly higher number of scatter events at a given radius compared to refp2 and refp3 .",
    "our main focus in this work is the structural change of the subhalo population in a sidm halo . in the following",
    "we will mainly focus on the subhalo population within @xmath97  kpc halocentric distance . in the left panel of figure  [ fig : sub_stat ]",
    "we first show the ratio of the subhalo mass function of our different models ( for the highest resolution run , level 3 ) to the best fit subhalo mass function of the cdm aquarius haloes ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the disfavoured refp1 model differs significantly from the cdm prediction , contrary to the refp2 and refp3 models that have mass functions very similar to the refp0 model .",
    "this means that subhalo masses do not change significantly in the vdsidm models , whereas subhaloes lose mass in the refp1 model .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : sub_stat ] shows the subhalo radial number density profiles for the different models .",
    "the subhalo population has been divided in three mass bins : @xmath98m@xmath87 , @xmath99m@xmath87 and @xmath100m@xmath87 , from bottom to top , respectively ( the last two bins are shifted up by one ( two ) dex for clarity , in fact the three curves lie on top of each other ) .",
    "once again , the velocity - dependent scenarios are essentially indistinguishable from the cdm model ( at all masses ) , whereas the refp1 model shows a considerably lower abundance of subhaloes within the virial radius of the main halo ( particularly for the least massive subhaloes ) , which is more acute in the inner regions .",
    "although not shown here , we checked that the lower resolution runs converge to the level 3 curves for both subhalo mass function and radial distribution for all models .",
    "the subhalo evaporation seen in the refp1 model is explained by the interaction that takes place between the particles of a given subhalo and the higher velocity particles of the surrounding host halo . since these collisions are elastic , the net effect is a transfer of energy to the particles in the subhalo , unbinding the ones with the lowest binding energies .",
    "these interactions are more common in the inner region of the main halo where the density is higher , and strongly reduce the abundance of subhaloes there .",
    "on the other hand , evaporation is not effective in the velocity - dependent models where self - interactions are strongly suppressed for high relative velocities , typically expected between particles in the subhaloes and those of the host .",
    "this is an important result since it implies that the overabundance of dwarf haloes is still present for the vdsidm models explored here .",
    "this means that the `` missing satellite problem '' would need to be solved by invoking astrophysical processes as is done for the cdm model .",
    "we note however that this is only true for elastic scattering , for the inelastic case , subhalo evaporation should have a relevant role .",
    "we leave the study of this case for a future analysis .",
    "the internal structure of the subhalo population can be appreciated in the left panel of figure  [ fig : sub_density ] that shows the density profiles at @xmath101 for the 15 most massive subhaloes in our highest resolution simulations ( level 3 ) for the cases refp0 ( black ) , refp1 ( red ) , refp2 ( blue ) and refp3 ( green ) .",
    "the figure shows that the vdsidm cases produce subhaloes with cores of approximately @xmath102  pc ; there is little difference between cases refp2 and refp3 , with the latter having slightly larger cores . beyond @xmath95",
    "kpc , these cases are indistinguishable from cdm .",
    "the case where self - interaction is independent of velocity ( refp1 ) results in cores that have lower density and are more extended ( approximately a factor of @xmath1032 ) .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : sub_density ] shows the mean free path as a function of radius for the difference sidm cases .",
    "we note that one of the shown subhalo of the refp1 halo entered already the core - collapse regime , and therefore shows a very steep density profile .",
    "other subhaloes are still in the core - expansion phase resulting in significantly shallower profiles compared to the cdm ( refp0 ) curves .",
    "we note that the cores of the main halo and the massive subhaloes ( left panel of figure  [ fig : mainhalo_density ] and figure  [ fig : sub_density ] ) are roughly of the same size .",
    "contrary to previous velocity - dependent sidm models , ours seem to predict no strong scaling of the core size with mass .",
    "a concern might be that for cluster - sized systems , the hierarchical nature of structure formation implies that they were assembled from small mass halos that formed at earlier epochs .",
    "this means it is possible that although our vdsidm models predict a vanishing cross - section for cluster scales , such systems might still exhibit large cores due to the assembly of smaller significantly cored systems ; such a large cluster core might violate observational constraints .",
    "however , the mass contribution from these smaller systems to the central region of the cluster is expected to be subdominant @xcite and therefore the evolution of the inner regions of larger haloes is likely to be affected only in a minor way by the merging of smaller cored subhaloes .",
    "to check the the consistency between the subhalo population of our sidm simulations and the kinematic data of the mw dsphs we construct circular velocity curves for the most massive subhaloes within @xmath97  kpc halocentric distance for refp0 - 3 .",
    "the dsphs sample consists of the 9 galaxies used in @xcite : fornax , leo i , sculptor , leo ii , sextans , carina , ursa minor , canes venatici i and draco , selected with the criterion @xmath104m@xmath87 .",
    "the sagittarius dwarf was removed from this sample since it is in the process of interacting strongly with the galactic disc .",
    "this sample of bright dsphs ( plus sagittarius ) is complete within the virial radius of the mw ( excluding the possibility of undiscovered systems hidden in the galactic plane ) .",
    "the large and small magellanic clouds are considerably brighter than the dsphs , and also more massive ; @xcite puts a conservative lower limit to the maximum rotational velocity of the subhaloes that could host these systems : @xmath105  kms@xmath106 .",
    "although in this work we do not attempt to find magellanic cloud analogues in our simulations , we remark that some of the most massive subhaloes would actually correspond to these systems rather than to the mw dsphs .",
    "since the mw dsphs are among the most dm - dominated galaxies , having very large dynamical mass - to - light ratios ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , their stars are reliable dynamical tracers of their underlying dm subhaloes . since the available data for dsphs provides information only in three dimensions , whereas the phase - space distribution function is 6-dimensional , the derived radial mass profiles from this data usually carries a degeneracy with the anisotropy profile which prevents model - independent constrains on the underlying mass profile using a standard jeans analysis ( making for example a cored and a nfw profile equally acceptable by the data ) . analyses that make use of more information in the data",
    "can extract more information about the mass profile .",
    "this has been accomplished not just with consideration of multiple stellar components , but also through schwarzschild modelling @xcite and indirectly based on arguments about survival of cold substructure within ursa minor @xcite and the distribution of globular clusters in fornax @xcite .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite found that the value of the mass enclosed within the 3-dimensional de - projected half - light radius @xmath107 is accurately given by @xmath108 ( or equivalently @xmath109 ) , where @xmath110 is the luminosity - weighted square of the line - of - sight velocity dispersion . this approximation is valid as long as the velocity dispersion profile @xmath111 remains relatively flat out to the 2-dimensional projected half - light radius .",
    "the quality of the kinematic data for the sample of dsphs we have mentioned , guarantees the estimation of @xmath112 with high accuracy .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sub_vcirc ] we show the circular velocity profiles at @xmath101 of the 15 most massive subhaloes ( largest peak circular velocity ) in our simulations for refp0 - 3 from top left to bottom right .",

    "the circular velocity curves are taken from the level 2 aq - a-2 simulation ( @xmath113  pc spatial resolution ) since the level 3 simulation is not converged in that case due to the cuspyness of the subhalo density profiles .",
    "convergence is easier to achieve for the sidm models , because they do not develop cuspy profiles , but have constant density cores as shown in figure  [ fig : sub_density ] .",

    "the cores are clearly visible in the vdsidm simulation along with the better convergence . we therefore conclude that the velocity profiles of the sidm simulations shown in figure  [ fig : sub_vcirc ] are not significantly affected by numerical effects . as for the refp1 curves in figure  [ fig : sub_density ] we note one of the shown subhaloes has already entered the core - collapse regime by z=0 , which is also clearly visible from the circular velocity curves .    as is evident from figure  [ fig : sub_vcirc ] , the vdsidm models , which do not violate any of the astrophysical constraints ,",
    "create a subhalo population whose most massive systems are dynamically consistent with the bright dsps .",
    "although the subhalo cores are not as large as in the case of a constant self - scattering cross section ( refp1 , top right ) , they are substantial enough to alleviate the tension with the data present in the cdm case ( refp0 ) .",
    "we emphasise that although the most massive subhaloes have essentially the same maximum rotational velocities , i.e. the same mass , in the vdsidm cases as in cdm , the vdsidm subhaloes are much less concentrated and are therefore consistent with the observational data .    looking at figure  [ fig : sub_vcirc ] we see that at least three of the dsphs ( fornax , sextans and canes venatici i , that have a value of @xmath115  kpc ) are inconsistent with the circular velocity profile of the 15 most massive subhaloes in all our sidm simulations , particularly for the cases with a velocity - dependent cross section .",
    "this however , does not mean that there are no subhaloes in these simulations that are a good match to these galaxies .",
    "these subhaloes exist but are considerably less massive than the ones we show in figure  [ fig : sub_vcirc ] and are more affected by the limited resolution of our simulations .",
    "we note that even in the cdm case there seems to be enough subhaloes that are consistent with these three galaxies , although a possible concern is the high number of massive subhaloes that can be potentially compared with the dsphs .",
    "this is already evident in the cdm case : looking at the top leftmost panel of figure 3 of @xcite ( corresponding to the aq - a halo ) , we see that in order to find subhaloes that are consistent with all the 9 mw dsphs , it is necessary to consider approximately 30 subhaloes .",
    "this issue is to be expected for the vdsidm cases we have explored here as well .",
    "we believe however that this is a problem that is more likely related to the stochastic nature of the abundance of the subhalo population in the aquarius haloes .",
    "for instance , looking at the second panel from the top left in figure 3 of @xcite , it seems that aq - b ( another of the mw - like haloes simulated in the aquarius project ) has approximately 15 subhaloes that can be compared with the dsphs , which would clearly eliminate the aforementioned problem .",
    "of course , a more detailed analysis needs to be done to firmly conclude this .",
    "such analysis would include , in addition to possibly re - simulating other aquarius haloes , making a one - to - one matching of the simulated subhalo population with the observed dsphs in a similar way to what was done in @xcite . in that work ,",
    "those subhaloes that are considered magellanic cloud analogs are removed from the sample , and also the subhalo ranking is done according to their mass at infall ( just before they merged with the host halo ) , which is a better proxy of the potential well that shaped the luminous galaxy than the subhalo mass at @xmath101 .",
    "we emphasise that the objective of this paper is to present an initial exploration of the vdsidm models discussed in section [ mod_sec ] and show explicitly that contrary to the cdm case , these vdsidm models do not predict a number of subhaloes which are too concentrated to host the bright dsphs .",
    "the observed abundance and properties of dwarf galaxies have been an enduring challenge for the remarkably successful cdm paradigm for more than a decade now .",
    "recent observations with high quality kinematic data seem to confirm that at least some of the dm - dominated mw dsphs have central density cores instead of the high density cusps predicted by cdm @xcite . at the same time",
    ", the actual number of observed dwarf galaxies in the field ( as inferred from the hi alfalfa survey ) seems to be in tension with the large abundance of dwarf haloes predicted by the cdm model @xcite .",
    "this seems to be a more serious challenge than the well known excess of dm subhaloes compared to the number of observed mw satellites , pointed out over a decade ago @xcite , and that has a viable solution based on the quenching of star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "another potential `` failure '' of the cdm model has been raised very recently by @xcite , who showed that the subhaloes kinematically associated to the mw dsphs seem to be much less concentrated than the most massive subhaloes of current cdm simulations .",
    "a solution to all these challenges based exclusively on processes related to the formation an evolution of the luminous galaxies within the dwarf dm haloes can not completely be ruled out currently .",
    "for instance , there are suggestions to create cores in cdm haloes as a response of the cuspy profile to energetic feedback .",
    "recent hydrodynamical simulations seem to be successful in producing cores if strong feedback mechanisms are invoked ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is however important to consider viable alternatives to the cdm model that preserve its success on large scales and that , at the same time , are able to solve the small - scale problems .",
    "one of these alternatives is to consider the possibility that dm is collisional ( sidm first proposed by @xcite ) , with self - interactions that are able to isotropise the orbits of dm particles and create a core in the inner regions of the haloes . in order for this alternative to be feasible",
    ", the dm - dm scattering cross section should avoid current astrophysical constraints , particularly stringent in clusters of galaxies that are consistent with the cdm model ( for a summary of constraints see * ? ? ? * ) , and at the same time be large enough to produce large density cores in dwarf galaxies .    in this paper",
    "we make a first assessment of the viability of a class of velocity - dependent sidm ( vdsidm ) models @xcite using high resolution numerical simulations .",
    "more specifically we explore a simplified particle physics model where the self - scattering between dm particles is set by an attractive yukawa potential mediated by a new gauge boson ( either scalar or vector ) in the dark sector @xcite .",
    "this model , naturally predicts a transfer cross section that depends on velocity in such a way that can produce a significant effect in dwarf galaxies and avoid astrophysical constraints on larger scales ( see section [ mod_sec ] ) .",
    "we implement an algorithm , based on a monte carlo approach , to account for dm self - interactions within the framework of this sidm model in the gadget-3 code for cosmological simulations ; the description and testing of this algorithm can be found in section [ tech ] .",
    "we use this modified code to run simulations of a mw - like halo using the initial conditions of one of the haloes of the aquarius project ( aq - a , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) exploring two reference points within the allowed parameter space of the sidm model for a elastic scattering case ( refp2 and refp3 ; see table [ table : ref_points ] and section [ ic ] ) . as a reference , we also explored a constant cross section sidm model ( refp1 ) which is ruled out by observations in galaxy clusters ( see sections [ mod_sec ] and [ ic ] ) .",
    "we find that for both of these cases , the density profile of the main halo remains the same as in the standard cdm case outside @xmath0  kpc , whereas inside this radius a very small core develops ( see section [ main_halo ] and figure  [ fig : mainhalo_density ] ) .",
    "the subhalo abundance and radial number density distribution are not affected in the vdsidm models we explored ( figure  [ fig : sub_stat ] ) , which implies that in the elastic case , these models have the same problem as the cdm model regarding the excess of low - mass subhaloes . on the other hand , the internal density profile ( within @xmath0  kpc ) of the most massive subhaloes",
    "change significantly due to the formation of a constant density core in their centre ( figure  [ fig : sub_density ] ) .",
    "we show that the circular velocity profiles of these subhaloes are consistent with the kinematics of the brightest mw dsphs ( figure  [ fig : sub_vcirc ] ) .",
    "specifically , and contrary to the cdm case , there are no subhaloes that are more concentrated than what is inferred from the kinematics of these galaxies .",
    "we therefore conclude that the sidm models explored here significantly reduce the tension encountered between the observational data and the standard cdm predictions .",
    "the highest numerical resolution of the simulations presented in this work ( @xmath91  m@xmath87 , @xmath92  pc ) is sufficient to obtain converged density and velocity profiles for the more massive subhaloes ( figure  [ fig : sub_conv ] ) , but is not enough to reliable trust those for smaller mass subhaloes . in a future work ,",
    "we plan to make a more detailed analysis of the subhalo population extending to these small - mass systems and use an abundance matching technique ( based on the mass of the subhaloes at infall , which is better correlated with the luminosity of the galaxy ) to make a one - to - one matching between the simulated subhaloes and the mw dsphs .",
    "we expect that this will further reduce the tension between the dark subhalo population and the observed dsphs , and strengthen the case for vdsidm models .",
    "an additional improvement of our algorithm is to explore the possibility of inelastic scattering . in particular , in models where excited , nearly - degenerate , dm states are possible , exothermic collisions could `` evaporate '' subhaloes by ejecting particles during down - scatterings .",
    "this could potentially alleviate the problem on the overabundance of low mass subhaloes as well .",
