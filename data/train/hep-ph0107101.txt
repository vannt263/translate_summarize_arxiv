    "<S> we compute the @xmath0 total cross section for the process @xmath1 in the standard model , at @xmath2  tev . </S>",
    "<S> the next - to - leading order corrections drastically reduce the renormalization and factorization scale dependence of the born cross section and slightly decrease the total cross section for renormalization and factorization scales between @xmath3 and @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> fsu - hep-2001 - 0601    bnl - het-01/20    hep - ph/0107101    * next - to - leading order results + .2 in for @xmath5  production at the tevatron *   +   + _ physics department , florida state university , + tallahassee , fl 32306 , usa _ +   + _ physics department , brookhaven national laboratory , + upton , ny 11973 , usa _    * 1 . * among the most important goals of present and future colliders is the study of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism and the origin of fermion masses . </S>",
    "<S> if the introduction of one or more higgs fields is responsible for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry , then at least one higgs boson should be relatively light , and certainly in the range of energies of present ( tevatron ) or future ( lhc ) hadron colliders . </S>",
    "<S> the present lower bounds on the higgs mass have been set by lep to be @xmath6  gev  @xcite for the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson ( @xmath7 ) , and @xmath8  gev  @xcite for the light scalar ( @xmath9 ) and pseudoscalar ( @xmath10 ) higgs bosons of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , precision fits to sm results indirectly point to the existence of a light higgs boson , @xmath11  gev  @xcite , while the mssm requires the existence of a scalar higgs boson lighter than about @xmath12  gev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the possibility of a higgs boson discovery in the mass range around @xmath13  gev seems increasingly likely .    in this context </S>",
    "<S> , the tevatron will play a crucial role and will have the opportunity to discover a higgs boson in the mass range between the experimental lower bound and about 180  gev  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dominant higgs production modes at the tevatron are gluon - gluon fusion , @xmath14 , and the associated production with a weak boson , @xmath15 . because of small event rates and large backgrounds , the higgs search in these channels can be problematic , requiring the highest possible luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore necessary to investigate all possible production channels , in the effort to fully exploit the range of opportunities offered by the available statistics .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , attention has been drawn to the possibility of detecting a higgs signal in association with a pair of top - antitop quarks , i.e. in @xmath16  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this production mode can play a role almost over the entire higgs mass range accessible at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> although it has a small event rate , @xmath17  fb for a sm like higgs , the signature ( @xmath18 ) is quite spectacular . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , at the tevatron ( unlike at the lhc ) , the signal and background for this process have quite different shapes . </S>",
    "<S> the statistics are too low to allow any direct measurement of the top yukawa couplings , but recent studies @xcite indicate that this channel can reduce the luminosity required for a higgs discovery at run ii of the tevatron by as much as 15 - 20% </S>",
    "<S> .    up to now the cross section for @xmath19 has been known only at tree level . as for any other hadronic process </S>",
    "<S> , first order qcd corrections are expected to be important and are crucial in order to reduce the dependence of the cross section on the renormalization and factorization scales . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of our calculation of the nlo qcd corrections to the total cross section for @xmath20 in the standard model , at the tevatron . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed review of the calculation will be presented elsewhere  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we find good agreement with the analogous results presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * 2 . * </S>",
    "<S> the total cross section for @xmath20 at @xmath0 can be written as : @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the nlo parton distribution functions for parton @xmath23 in a proton / antiproton , defined at a generic factorization scale @xmath24 , and @xmath25 is the @xmath0 parton level total cross section for incoming partons @xmath23 and @xmath26 , made of the two channels @xmath27 , and renormalized at an arbitrary scale @xmath28 which we also take to be @xmath29 . at the tevatron , for @xmath30 collisions at hadronic center of mass energy @xmath2  tev , </S>",
    "<S> more than @xmath31 of the tree level total cross section comes from @xmath32 , summed over all light quark flavors . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we compute @xmath33 by including in @xmath25 only the @xmath34 corrections to @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath36 at @xmath0 is , however , crucial to determine @xmath37 for the lhc , since in @xmath38 collisions at @xmath39  tev a large fraction of the total cross section comes from the @xmath40 channel . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath41 total cross section for the lhc has been estimated within the effective higgs approximation in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> full results are presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and will also appear in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we write the @xmath0 parton level total cross section as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the strong coupling constant renormalized at the arbitrary scale @xmath29 , @xmath44 is the @xmath45 born cross section , and @xmath46 consists of the @xmath47 corrections to the born cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the born cross section @xmath48 has a strong @xmath49-dependence , which is canceled at nlo by @xmath50 , up to term of @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting nlo cross section is therefore much more stable under variations of @xmath49 , as will be discussed in the following ( see also fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : mudep ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 contains both virtual and real corrections to the lowest order cross section and can be written as the sum of two terms : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are respectively the matrix elements squared for the @xmath41 @xmath56 and @xmath57 processes averaged over the initial degrees of freedom and summed over the final ones , while @xmath58 and @xmath59 denote the integration over the corresponding three / four particle phase space . the first term represents the contribution of the virtual corrections , while the last one is due to the real gluon emission .    </S>",
    "<S> * 3 . * the @xmath34 virtual corrections to the tree level @xmath60 process consist of self - energy , vertex , box , and pentagon diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of the virtual diagrams has been performed using dimensional regularization in @xmath61 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the diagrams have been evaluated using form @xcite and _ maple _ , and all tensor integrals have been reduced to linear combinations of a fundamental set of scalar integrals . </S>",
    "<S> we have computed analytically all scalar integrals which give rise to either ultraviolet or infrared singularities , while finite scalar integrals have been evaluated using standard packages  @xcite . among the integrals which have been computed analytically , many scalar box integrals and the scalar pentagon integrals are extremely laborious , due to the large number of massive particles present in the final state . box and pentagon diagrams are ultraviolet finite , but have infrared divergences . </S>",
    "<S> these integrals are evaluated using the method of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and analytic results are presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> self - energy and vertex diagrams contain both infrared and ultraviolet divergences . </S>",
    "<S> the ultraviolet divergences are renormalized by introducing a suitable set of counterterms . </S>",
    "<S> since the cross section is a renormalization group invariant , we only need to renormalize the wave function of the external fields , the top quark mass , and the coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> we use on - shell subtraction for the wave - function renormalization of the external fields . </S>",
    "<S> we define the top mass counterterm in such a way that @xmath3 is the pole mass . </S>",
    "<S> this counterterm must be used twice : once to renormalize the top quark mass , and again to renormalize the top quark yukawa coupling . </S>",
    "<S> finally , for @xmath43 we use the @xmath62 scheme , modified to decouple the top quark @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first @xmath63 light fermions are subtracted using the @xmath62 scheme , while the divergences associated with the heavy quark loop are subtracted at zero momentum .    </S>",
    "<S> * 4 . * the @xmath34 corrections to the born cross section due to real gluon emission have been computed using a two cut - off implementation of the phase space slicing algorithm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the contributions to @xmath64 are first divided into a soft and a hard contribution , @xmath65 where _ soft _ and _ hard _ refer to the energy of the radiated gluon . </S>",
    "<S> this division into hard and soft contributions depends on an arbitrary soft cut - off , @xmath66 , such that the energy of the radiated gluon is considered soft if @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> the cut - off @xmath66 must be very small , such that terms of order @xmath66 can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to evaluate the soft contribution , the eikonal approximation to the matrix elements can be taken and the integral over the soft degrees of freedom performed analytically .    the hard contribution to @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> is further divided into a hard / collinear and a hard / not collinear region . </S>",
    "<S> the hard / collinear region is defined as the region where the energy of the gluon is @xmath69 and the gluon is radiated from the initial massless quarks at an angle @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) such that @xmath72 , for an arbitrary small collinear cut - off @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix element squared in the hard / collinear limit is found using the leading pole approximation and the integration over the angular degrees of freedom is performed analytically . </S>",
    "<S> the hard gluon emission from the final massive quarks never belongs to the hard / collinear region . </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the hard / not collinear region is finite and is computed numerically .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath74 and @xmath75 contain ir singularities , which are calculated using dimensional regularization , and cancel exactly the analogous singularities from the virtual contributions , after absorbing mass singularities in the renormalized parton distribution functions .    </S>",
    "<S> both @xmath74 and @xmath76 depend on the two arbitrary cut - offs @xmath66 and @xmath73 , but their sum , i.e. the physical cross section , is cut - off independent . in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : deltas ] , we show the dependence of @xmath77 on the soft cut - off , @xmath66 , for a fixed value of the hard / collinear cut - off , @xmath78 . in the upper window we illustrate the cancellation of the @xmath66 dependence between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , while in the lower window we show @xmath77 with the statistical errors from the monte carlo integration . for @xmath66 in the range @xmath81 , </S>",
    "<S> a clear plateau is reached and the result is independent of @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : deltas ] only shows distributions of the form @xmath82 , so the corresponding cross sections are in this case twice the values that can be read from the plot . </S>",
    "<S> analogously , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : deltac ] shows the independence of @xmath77 on the hard / collinear cut - off , @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> all the results presented in the following are obtained using @xmath66 and @xmath73 of order @xmath83 .    </S>",
    "<S> * 5 . </S>",
    "<S> * our numerical results are found using cteq4 m parton distribution functions for the calculation of the nlo cross section , and cteq4l parton distribution functions for the calculation of the lowest order cross section  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo ( lo ) cross section is evaluated using the @xmath84 ( @xmath85)-loop evolution of @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> the top quark mass is taken to be @xmath86  gev and @xmath87 .    </S>",
    "<S> first of all , in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : mudep ] we show , for @xmath88  gev , how at nlo the dependence on the arbitrary renormalization scale @xmath49 is significantly reduced . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that only for scales @xmath49 greater than @xmath89 is the nlo result greater than the lowest order result .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : signlo ] shows both the lo and the nlo total cross section for @xmath19 at @xmath2  tev , for two values of the renormalization scale @xmath90 and @xmath91 . over the entire range of @xmath92 accessible at the tevatron , </S>",
    "<S> the nlo corrections decrease the rate . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath88  gev and @xmath90 the nlo total cross section is reduced to @xmath93 from the lowest order prediction of @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction is much less dramatic at @xmath95 , as can be seen from both fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : mudep ] and fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : signlo ] . </S>",
    "<S> the complete nlo result includes the lowest order result and the contribution of the two terms given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ terms ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the error we quote on our values is the statistical error on the numerical integration involved in evaluating the total cross section .    </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding k - factor , i.e. the ratio of the nlo cross section to the lo one @xmath96 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fg : sigk ] . </S>",
    "<S> given the strong scale dependence of the lo cross section , the k - factor also shows a significant @xmath49-dependence , while it is almost constant with @xmath92 . for scales </S>",
    "<S> @xmath49 between @xmath90 and @xmath95 , the k - factor varies roughly between @xmath97 and @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the nlo cross section with respect to the born cross section is due to fact that at @xmath2 tev the @xmath99 final state is produced in the threshold region . in this region </S>",
    "<S> the gluon exchange between the final state quarks gives origin to coulomb singularities that contribute to the cross section with terms of order @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the velocity of the top / antitop quark in the @xmath102 cm frame . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath99 final state is in a color octet configuration , these corrections are negative and therefore decreases the born cross section , causing the k - factor to be smaller than unity . </S>",
    "<S> the same effect was observed in the nlo cross section for @xmath103  @xcite . in that case , however , the @xmath99 final state is in a color singlet configuration and the threshold corrections are positive .    </S>",
    "<S> * 6 . * </S>",
    "<S> the next - to - leading order qcd corrections to the standard model process @xmath104 , at @xmath2 tev , reduce the cross section by a factor of @xmath105 for renormalization and factorization scales @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> the nlo result shows a drastically reduced scale dependence as compared to the born result and leads to increased confidence in predictions based on these results . </S>"
