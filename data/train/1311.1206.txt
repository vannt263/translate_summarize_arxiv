    "both star formation and stellar feedback play crucial roles in galaxy evolution .",
    "star formation leads to stellar feedback , which in turn is assumed to regulate the star formation rate and prevent galaxies from turning all their gas into stars over less than a @xmath0 ; moderate star formation rates are implied from low and high redshift observations .",
    "in contrast , pure hydrodynamic simulations and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation tend to predict high gas densities within galaxies .",
    "these densities cause the gas to cool very efficiently and supersede the density threshold required for star formation @xcite . for purely hydrodynamic simulations ,",
    "unrealistically strong stellar feedback is often necessary to regulate the star formation rate in galaxies @xcite .",
    "several approaches have been attempted to regulate simulations of star formation during galaxy evolution . within the framework of pure hydrodynamics ,",
    "the most basic feedback mechanism is usually thermal feedback , or injection of some fraction of the supernova energy into the gas .",
    "since this energy is injected into dense , cold gas it cools efficiently and typically has small overall effect on galaxy evolution @xcite .",
    "momentum feedback is added by explicitly injecting momentum to the material that surrounds star forming regions @xcite .",
    "while the efficiency of such models is slightly better than thermal feedback @xcite , the ejected gas is almost always highly supersonic and kinteic energy is converted to thermal radiation very efficiently through shocks , unless the feedback is injected effectively over very large volumes @xcite .",
    "attempts have also been made to inject the energy into a warm component of a two - phase gas , effectively delaying the cooling until energy is transferred from the diffuse gas to a denser gas which immediately cools @xcite .",
    "an additional technique sometime used has been to increase the efficiency of the feedback by releasing the feedback energy in bursts rather than spread out @xcite .",
    "however , in all these recipes , the cooling of a parcel of gas near the plane of the disc still occurs with isobaric boundary conditions set by the weight of the atmosphere on top of it .",
    "once the gas cools , it contracts over a crossing time to regain its pressure . since the cooling rate scales as @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the gas density )",
    "this leads to runway cooling . in order to increase the efficiency of supernova feedback , the cooling of injected energy is artificially delayed @xcite , and momentum feedback efficiency in enhanced by preventing it from interacting with its immediate , dense environment @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we revisit the conjecture that non - thermal processes contribute to the total pressure . with this additional pressure",
    ", gas can reach hydrostatic equilibrium with a considerably lower gas density that naturally predicts lower star formation rate and bypasses the need for unrealistic supernovae feedback .",
    "the non - thermal pressure does not depend on the temperature of the gas , and the gas cools isochorically rather than isobarically , further stabilizing the gas .",
    "we develop a simple , easy to use , parametric model which allows to study ( analytically and in simulations ) the effect of such non - thermal components on galaxy formation .",
    "the enhanced star formation problem is closely related to the general complication of modeling the interstellar medium ( ism ) gas .",
    "while the use of a standard , purely thermodynamic equation of state of an ideal gas is justified outside of galaxies in the igm , it becomes less appropriate to use in haloes ( haloes of galaxy clusters exhibit non - negligible magnetic fields ) and even more so in the ism of galaxies .",
    "this gas is highly multiphased , and consists of cold , warm and hot gas arranged within atomic and molecular clouds , filaments , and bubbles @xcite .",
    "complicated chemistry and dynamics , as well as radiation fields at multiple wavelengths affect the behaviour and interrelation between the different phases",
    ". moreover , the dynamics of the gas are strongly affected by non - thermal components , namely turbulence , magnetic fields and cosmic rays ( cr ) .",
    "stars , through their formation , evolution and destruction pump energy into the ism by stirring turbulence , emitting high energy particles ( cosmic rays ) and releasing radiation that heats and drives the gas @xcite .",
    "gravitational energy also powers turbulence @xcite and heats the gas ( see however * ? ? ?",
    "turbulence , could , in principle be accurately followed by pure hydrodynamics .",
    "however , modeling turbulence requires high resolution and realistic driving of the turbulence which is still an open question @xcite .",
    "the detailed modeling of these effects is the subject of intensive ongoing efforts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all these physical phenomena are determind by the relatively small ( @xmath3pc ) scale of observed giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , large eddies of turbulence @xcite , and tangled magnetic fields .",
    "it is prohibitively challenging to include all the aforementioned effects and small scales in cosmological simulations .",
    "effective equations of state for star forming gas are thus constructed , directly pressurizing the thermal component of the gas @xcite .",
    "an equation of state for subgrid turbulence has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed an effective eos directly related to star formation rates , and @xcite incorporated turbulent pressure as a sub - grid model of the various phases motivated by @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that sub - grid models for supersonic turbulence can have a large affect on dwarf galaxies .",
    "while these attempts artificially pressurize the gas ( as we propose below ) they do not prevent the gas from over - cooling isobarically and still require the unrealistically strong feedback described above .",
    "recent attempts @xcite to simulate the effects of cosmic ray pressure on star formation and winds in galaxies have shown that they are able to drive significant outflows and could be efficient in regulating the star formation of star forming galaxies . @xcite separately implemented a two fluid approximation for cosmic rays and gas for single - galaxy simulations , and propagated the cr as a diffusive component with constant diffusion coefficient .",
    "@xcite used an mhd code to simulate anisotropic diffusion that preferentially diffuses crs along magnetic fields . in all three implementations the crs",
    "are found to drive winds in some cases .",
    "these results are encouraging but the simulations are of single , ideal galaxies and the suggested methods can not be easily extended to the evolution phases of the galaxies and cosmological initial conditions .",
    "their physics is too detailed and the required resolutions are too fine to be practical in full hydrodynamic cosmological simulations . to date , no simulations exists that include all the physical processes which are important for pressurizing the gas , and no cosmological - scale simulation will likely be able to simulate all this physics in the forthcoming future .    in view of all these complications",
    ", here we follow a simpler , alternative avenue , and construct an effective eos that mimics some of the main observed characteristics of the non - thermal pressure components .",
    "first , we take advantage of the fact that a scale separation roughly exists between the parsec - scale phenomena discussed in the previous paragraph and that of typical observed scales for vertical scale heights of discs which range between @xmath4 for the milky way @xcite and quiescent star forming galaxies to @xmath5 for starbursting high redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "this implies that in the context of galaxy formation simulations , it should be sufficient to resolve the ism on scales much larger than @xmath61 parsec in order to reproduce galactic discs with realistic characteristics .",
    "correspondingly we use a coarse grained , effective modeling of the ism .",
    "our model bridges the gap between the parsec and kilo - parsec scales .",
    "second , we complement this scale separation with an effective equation of state that is straightforward to use . in principle , one can attempt to apply a rigorous treatment of the physical processes that constitute the non - thermal physics as sub - grid models . however , even if realistic such modules were constructed , there remains the problem of stipulating physically - consistant initial conditions : how to seed magnetic fields , how and when cosmic rays are generated and accelerated , and what drives turbulence and precisely on which scales . in addition , one has to relate the initial conditions to star formation which most likely drives these effects .",
    "hence , we opt for a simple , easy to use , pressure - density relation for the non - thermal eos which we develop below .",
    "a key feature of our implementation is the calibration of the eos by the observed relation between the fir radiation - a star formation indicator - and the radio radiation , which constrains the joint energy content of cosmic rays and magnetic fields .",
    "this novel approach provides a quantitative relation between the gas density and the magnitude of the non - thermal components .",
    "additional physical assumptions which are required to complete the specific parametrization of the effective eos are then limited to factors of order unity , rather than being arbitrary .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : eos ] we describe possible modifications for the equation of state of the gas that manifest some important aspects of the non - thermal pressure components . in ",
    "[ sec : toymodel ] we demonstrate the effectivenes of such modified eos and and the importance of the non - thermal conmponents in general , using simple calculations of a point ( single - cell ) model , focusing on the regaulation of the overall star formation rate .  [ sec : ramses ] describes the incorporation of the model into the hydrodynamic code _ ramses _ @xcite and the setup and results of isolated galaxy simulations with and without our model . in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "to incorporate non - thermal pressure we need some typical scale for its density dependence and amplitude .",
    "we will use the observed fir - radio relation for a typical value of magnetic field and .",
    "the model we describe in this paper assumes that ( i ) the non - thermal components are in equilibrium between themselves in the sense that energy can move quickly between them , and ( ii ) that this equilibrium does not depend on the magnitude of the energy .",
    "the first assumption , of strong coupling between the components , is justified because the timescales for interactions between the components are eddy turnaround time for the turbulence , alfvnic crossing time for magnetic fields and diffusion times for cosmic rays , all on scales much smaller than galactic or cosmologic scales .",
    "an eddy turnaround time for a @xmath7 eddy rotating at a typical ism speed of @xmath8 would take less than @xmath9 - much smaller than cosmological evolution timescales .",
    "the alfvnic crossing time is even shorter : the velocity for @xmath10 and @xmath11 is about @xmath12 the diffusion coefficients for the cosmic rays indicate an even smaller timescale for equilibrium across a @xmath13 with a typical diffusion coefficient of @xmath14 the diffusion over this scale - length will take @xmath15 .",
    "we stress that the second assumption is not necessary for the effect of the non - thermal pressure to be important , and that we use it below for the sake of simplicity .",
    "there are , nonetheless , strong qualitative arguments which motivate such strong coupling . compelling physical arguments can be made in favor of the interrelation between turbulence energy and tangled magnetic field energy and cosmic rays .",
    "turbulence and magnetic fields are naturally related since turbulent flow can increase the energy in magnetic fields ( by elongating and wraping the field lines ) , while large magnetic fields tend to rearrange and freeze the material in order to decrease the length of the flux tubes ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion including the dependence on magnetic field geometry and turbulence velocity ) . either way ,",
    "energy is naturally converted from one component to the other .",
    "we assume that this qualitative argument holds , even though the dominant coupling process and the precise energy distribution between the components might vary somewhat ( see discussion and references in * ? ? ?",
    "* who also assumes equal energies in turbulence and magnetic fields for starbursting galaxies ) .",
    "equipartition between magnetic and cosmic rays should also be natural ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see however @xcite ) .",
    "cosmic rays are relativistic electrons and protons ( most likely accelerated during supernavae explosions ) , and travel along magnetic fields which confines them to the galaxy with some effective diffusion regulated by the fields .",
    "strong magnetic fields increase cosmic ray energy loses through synchotron radiation , and reduce the diffusion rate thus increasing the steady - state density of the cosmic rays in the galaxy .",
    "the simplest manifestation of such an approach is to assume equipartition between the three non - thermal components , so that the total energy density is three times that of each separate component .",
    "equipartition between magnetic fields and cosmic rays corresponds to a minimum of the total energy of cosmic rays and magnetic fields for a given measured synchrotron radio emission @xcite . in cases where the two are not in equipartition",
    "the combined non - thermal pressure due to the two components will be larger . finally , the cycle is completed by instabilities in the cr flows along magnetic fields giving rise to small scale turbulence @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that an equipartition between these three components are also observed in intra - cluster medium ( icm ) where they each contribute about @xmath16 of the total pressure , while the bulk of the pressure comes from the thermal component of x - ray emitting gas .",
    "we emphasize that the `` equipartition anzatz '' is basically just a scaling parameter for the effective non - thermal eos ; it is not an essential component of our model and different scalings can be used ( see below ) .",
    "once the distribution of energy among the non - thermal components is determined , we can naturally continue to develop an equation of state for them . while a `` proper '' thermal equation of state relates all the thermodynamic variables to two independent variables ( for example , the density and internal energy ) , a non - thermal component is , by nature , a single parameter function . in the case of magnetic fields , for example ,",
    "if a volume of space occupying magnetic fields is compressed , no heat is generated , and the process can be reversed .",
    "hence , the magnetic pressure and energy are functions of only one variable ( the field magnitude , @xmath17 ) which can in turn be related to only one thermodynamic variable .",
    "this is completely analogous to the equation of state of cold matter , which is commonly used in the analysis of compact objects .",
    "it is important that the concept of entropy does exist in multi - component non - thermal system , through the requirement for equilibrium .",
    "we note that the system is not closed , since energy is constantly pumped in by star formation and leaks out of the system by cosmic ray diffusion , electromagnetic radiation , reconnections , and dissipation of turbulence .",
    "hence the entropy of the non - thermal component can change while generating the equilibrium configuration .",
    "in other words a cold component is not a zero entropy system ( for example , we can not use the adiabatic relation between the work done on an element and the internal energy within it ) .",
    "again , in analogy with compact objects , this is the basis for deteminning the composition of high density matter in neutron stars , while allowing for energy loss through the emission of neutrinos . as mentioned above , in the absence of a first - princples model for the relation between magnetic fields , cosmic and turbulence , we simply assume that equipartition exists between these three components .",
    "this simplification allows us to evaluate the entire non - thermal pressure based on a relation between one of these components and the star formation rate , and dictating the energy density in the other two components by equating it to the first .    in accordance with this approach ,",
    "we base our derivation on relations between magnetic fields and the star formation rate .",
    "specifically , we model the dependence of the magnitude of magnetic field , @xmath17 , on the star formation rate , @xmath18 ( in mass per unit time per unit volume ) as a power law : @xmath19 . combined with a @xcite power law relating the star formation rate to the gas density , @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath20 we have a simple power law term of @xmath21 for which @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are all constants , which along with the proportionality factors must be constrained from observations .",
    "once this assumption has been made , the total non - thermal volumetric energy arising from these power laws takes the form : @xmath25 , @xmath26 with the prefactor of @xmath27 originating from the contributions of the @xmath27 components in equipartition .",
    "we reiterate that the equipartition is not a necessary assumption for this model .",
    "any constant distribution between the components is consistent with the assumptions and can be readily used .",
    "the effective equation of state can easily be modified for further deviations from the``equipartition anzatz '' , and any non - thermal pressure that is a monotonic function of density can be incorporated in an analogous way . essentially , the only requirement that can not be simply generalized is that the non - thermal components are in quasi - steady state that depends on the gas density alone .",
    "that is , that the non - thermal processes are related , and settle down on timescales which are short with respect to the evolution of galaxies .",
    "we begin with the simplest model that incorporates the additional non - thermal pressure components . in this model",
    "we assume that the energy in the non - thermal components is completely determined by the local instantaneous star formation rate . stipulating this assumption the energy in the non - thermal components becomes a simple function of @xmath2 .",
    "the function is determined by various physical processes that contribute to the non - thermal pressure of the ism , which depend differently on the density of the gas , but eventually materializes through equipartition . at this point",
    "we will also assume that the gas is always in appropriate conditions so that star formation is turned on .",
    "assuming a power - law dependence of @xmath17 ( equation [ eq : b_rho_alphaprime ] ) and a schmidt law for the star formation , the non - thermal pressure in equilibrium , @xmath28 , is : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a model dependent proportioanlity factor . here , and throughout the paper , we neglect the order - of - unity differences between pressure and energy density .",
    "magnetic field s pressure depends on the field s morphology and drops from @xmath31 for magnetic field in the disc s plane , to @xmath32 for isotropically tangled field .",
    "cr pressure equals @xmath33 of its energy density for non - relativistic particles .",
    "we show below that the while the detailed analysis changes somewhat , the qualitative effect of the non - thermal pressure remains unaffected .",
    "the total pressure at each point is the sum of the thermal and non - thermal pressure , @xmath34 . as an aside we mention that the sound speed of the gas is striaghtforward to calculate in this effective eos : for application in numerical codes",
    ", it is useful ( for setting the timesteps according to the courant conditions , for example ) to calculate the numerical speed of sound of gas : @xmath35 we note that it is not the physical speed of sound of the multi - component gas , which depends on the alfvnic velocity and largest eddy velocity in a non - trivial manner .",
    "the eos described in the previous subsection has the advantage of being extremely simple to implement since it requires a trivial addition to the ideal equation of state depending only on the gas density ; there is no need to specifically trace the non - thermal component .",
    "however , it suffers from undesired consequences that arise from the assumption that the non - thermal pressure traces the local instantaneuos star formation .",
    "this means that if star formation was to suddenly begin ( by passing the a threshold density , for example ) or to suddenly end ( perhaps if feedback blowing of the gas transfers it to a different thermodynamic regime where star formation is extinguished ) a sudden jump in the pressure will follow , and potentially create spurious shocks and disturbances .",
    "in addition , we know from observations that the magnetic field and cosmic ray vertical scale heights are considerably larger than those of the gas and star formation .",
    "@xcite estimates the magnetic scale height of the galaxy at @xmath36 based on rotation measures of pulsars @xcite and the cr scale height of @xmath37 based on observed abundance of secondary particles such as @xmath38 that are used to constrain various diffusion models for the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field of distant galaxies is also observed via polarization and radio emission measurements at a vertical scale of a few kiloparsecs above the disc plane ( see , for example * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the existence of non - thermal pressure based on radio observations and on a discrepancy between the vertical density and gravity profiles of the galaxy perpendicular to the plane at the local neighborhood was advocated by @xcite .",
    "the fact that magnetic fields and cosmic rays at regions that are far from star forming gas indicate that the coupling between the non - thermal components and star formation is more complicated than the simple assumptions in  [ sec : ssnteos ] . specifically , this suggests that the coupling is not instantaneous , but has a finite response time as energy convects with the gas or diffuses through it .",
    "alternatively , there may be additional sources for turbulence , magnetic fields and cr which are dominant at @xmath39 altitudes above the disc ( see , for example , @xcite for extra - galactic driving of turbulence and @xcite for internal ism instability - driven turbulence ) .    to address this complication we introduce another independent variable into the equation of state so that the amount of non - thermal energy responds to star formation over a finite time .",
    "we set @xmath40 ( equation [ eq : pnt ] ) as the equilibrium value of non - thermal pressure for a given stellar density , and add a time - dependent form of the actual non - thermal pressure , @xmath41 , which approaches @xmath40 through some temporal dependence .",
    "this adjustment expands the stationary eos and includes a time integrated function of the star formation rate in the non - thermal pressure , thus ensuring both temporal and spatial continuity even if star formation flicks on and off . keeping with the spirit of our model ,",
    "we do not attempt to describe the physics of the relaxation of the non - thermal component , and settle for a parametric description .",
    "we note that this formulation also removes the numerical complications which arise from discontinuities ( in the latter sense , this additional term has a stabilizing effect similar to the von - neumann artificial viscosity which was introduced to help integrate over the non - smooth shock conditions ) .",
    "we accomplish this by paramerterizing the non - thermal heating and cooling rate .",
    "since the two must cancel each other for a steady - state star formation , @xmath40 must be an attractor of @xmath41 at a any given mass density : if @xmath42 is too large then there should be a net cooling and vice versa",
    ".    non - thermal heating can be described by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the total energy injected into the gas per supernova , @xmath45 is the number of supernovae per solar mass of stars that are created , and with @xmath46 being the smaller than unity fraction of the supernova energy that ends up in the non - thermal components .",
    "non - thermal cooling is assumed to be responding to heating by the following characterization : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a free parameter which essentially controls the response time of the non - thermal components to changes in the star - formation rate .",
    "the resemblance between the cooling term and the heating term arises from the requirement that the gas be in cooling / heating equilibrium at a star formation rate consistent with observations . combining these heating and cooling terms",
    "the time - dependent evolution of the non - thermal pressure at a constant gas density follows the simple form : @xmath49.\\label{eq : p_nt_oft}\\ ] ] stability requires that : @xmath50 so that @xmath51 ensures that the non - thermal pressure always approaches its asymptotic value for a steady star formation rate .",
    "the time dependent modification makes it possible to explicitly deal with a density threshold condition , as observed by @xcite .",
    "this condition cuts off star formation completely for gas densities below a critical value , @xmath52 .",
    "we note that most numerical codes apply such a threshold ( but for considerably lower threshold densities ) also in order to prevent spurious star formation from occurring outside of galaxies . below this threshold ,",
    "the steady - state non - thermal pressure is expected to vanish . however , in reality , a non - star forming region can still maintain a steady state non - thermal pressure due to diffusion processes from neighboring regions @xcite , or to various other sources @xcite .",
    "we partly account for that within our `` single - cell '' framework by setting a finite decay rate for non - star - forming regions . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cooling1 ] ) , we can not set @xmath53 for @xmath54 , since the cooling rate then becomes ill defined .",
    "we remedy this by formulating @xmath40 as a function of @xmath2 ( rather than @xmath18 ) and redefining ( eq .  ( [ eq : pnt ] ) ) as follows :    @xmath55    using eq .",
    "( [ eq : heating ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : cooling1 ] ) now assures that the heating turns off when no star formation occurs , and the cooling can proceed as the non - thermal pressure asymptotically approaches @xmath56 . combining eq .",

    "( [ eq : sfr ] ) then yields : @xmath57.\\label{eq : p_nt_dot}\\ ] ]    there is a noteworthy simplification in our model . in order to achieve coarse - grained steady state of ism gas two conditions",
    "must be met simultaneously : the total pressure must balance the external pressure , and the cooling must balance the heating . for purely thermal pressure , these two equations are solved by varying two parameters - the density and temperature of the gas . for gas with purely non - thermal pressure components of the type proposed in this work ( which is a reasonable approximation for many external pressures ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : extp ] ) , the pressure is a function of density alone , and the pressure equilibrium and heating / cooling equilibrium generally do not have a simultaneous solution .",
    "we bypass this by relating the heating to the cooling in such a way that the observed relation is always achieved .",
    "more advanced models which include physically motivated cooling and heating will introduce more dynamic parameters , allowing the gas to reach steady state more naturally .",
    "we now demonstrate the proporties and applicability of our effective eos for non - thermal components with a point ( zero - dimensional ) model of the ism . in this model",
    "we evolve the conditions of a parcel of gas with isobaric boundary conditions , solving both thermal and non - thermal pressure components , in accordance with the models described in  [ sec : eos ] .",
    "a quantitative implementation of our eos requires the speficiation of the model s free parameters . for the stationary non - thermal pressure , these are the proportionality coeffecient and power which relate gas density to the pressure in magnetic fields ( @xmath58 ) . even after applying our hypothesis of equaipartition among the non - thermal components , current uncertainties regarding the magnitude of magnetic fields in early galaxies , are quite large .",
    "in essence , @xmath59 may be treated as free parameters .",
    "some indication can , however , be gained from observed relations between star formation rates and synchrotron radiation @xcite .",
    "we chose to use the fits from equation a11 of @xcite of the form : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are galactic gas column densities and galactic scale - heights of galaxies .",

    ". one could consider a case when the magnetic pressure scales linearly with density ( corresponding to the first fit ) , or to the star formation ( corresponding to a fit with @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) - but this parameter is not favored by the more detailed model there . as we point below , in our model ,",

    "x - rays are a good tracer for star formation as young ob stars emit x - rays @xcite and at high redshifts @xcite .",

    "the most efficient quenching occurs for `` standard sim '' and is a result of massive blowout of gas from the galaxy .",
    "`` weak sim '' depletes most of the gas rapidly , within the first @xmath205 of the simulation , demonstrating the overcooling catastrophe that occurs for insufficient feedback .",
    "`` non - thermal sim '' exhibits regulated star formation that produces stars at @xmath206 throughout the simulation .",
    "not surprisingly , our results indicate that non - thermal pressure can have a significant effect on star formation and prolong the depletion times of galaxies to the observed timescales .",
    "clearly further research will be required to quantify the relative importance of the non - thermal components to other feedback mechanisms that are applied .",
    "regardless , we emphasize that observational evidence , as well as robust theoretical motivation , point to the existence of this component and that , in one form or another , it should be incorporated in cosmological and galactic simulations .",
    "on galactic scales , the interstellar medium exists at quasi - static pressure that is required to support the atmosphere above it . in an equilibrium configuration , loss of pressure due to cooling processes",
    "is balanced by heating , which for typical disc galaxies at low redshifts , is dominated by stellar feedback .",
    "stellar feedback , through its dependence on star formation rate is related to the ism gas density .",
    "it is a well - known result that when only thermal pressure is considered in simulations , the resulting ism density constrained by the pressure and heating - cooling equilibria leads to relatively large star formation rates and short ( @xmath207myr ) gas depletion time scales .",
    "this is considerably faster than depletion times of @xmath208 inferred from observations @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider the contribution of non - thermal pressure components to this picture .",
    "non - thermal pressure consists of turbulence , cosmic rays and magnetic fields , and we examine their impact in an effective model .",
    "current cosmological simulations generally do not include the later two , and do not always resolve turbulence .",
    "we demonstrate that non - thermal pressure components can be instrumental in solving the depletion time discrepancy in two respects : they reduce the quasi - steady state density and the corresponding star formation rates and cooling times , and they stabilize the gas by adding longer relaxation times in cases where star formation flickers on and off .",
    "the regulating effect has been shown previously for cosmic rays @xcite and turbulence @xcite but the two were not considered together and in any case were not yet formulated in a way which is applicable to large scale cosmological simulations .    to test our assumptions",
    "we construct a simplified physical model for which all the non - thermal components achieve a steady state that is solely a function of density .",
    "while simplistic , the advantage of such an approach is that it is readily applicable in numerical simulations .",
    "furthermore , we calibrate this density dependence by using the observed relations between the star formation rate for various galaxy observations and the synchrotron radiation , so that the magnitude of the effect is reasonably constrained .",
    "to study its effect we first implement it into a single - zone numerical model that traces the evolution of a parcel of star forming gas with varying physical conditions under isobaric boundary conditions that mimic the pressure confinement of the gas by the atmosphere around and above it . using this mode",
    "we find that for a given , realistic , thermal feedback the depletion times naturally grow from @xmath209 to @xmath210 in better agreement with observations , and that the coarse grained density of the gas is reduced by several orders of magnitude .",
    "then , the model is implemented into the hydrodynamical code _",
    "ramses _ and we present three simulations of the same isolated milky - way - like galaxy with three different physical models . in the first we use some of the `` standard '' recipes generally used for feedback . using that model reduces star formation by blowing the gas to high temperatures and low densities , and expelling it from the galaxy .",
    "then , to demonstrate the problem we deliberately turn off one of the key feedback components - the delayed cooling and show that gas cools and accumulates at the numerical pressure floor with high densities that cause a depletion of the stars within @xmath211 - at odds with observed depletion times of @xmath212 in the third simulation we introduce the non - thermal model calibrated by the observed radio fir relation .",
    "for that model , the gas remains pressurized at intermediate temperatures and densities , reducing the non - physical low density gas of the first model , and the non - physical high density star forming gas of the second model .",
    "this model is effective in regulating star formation for a long period of time ( @xmath213 ) without blowing the gas out of the galaxy altogether .",
    "this work is a natural first step in incorporating non - thermal pressure components in galactic scale simulation .",
    "the next steps can , and should , pursue several avenues of research .",
    "the first is to better model the various non - thermal components , their internal interaction and their interaction with the thermal component and star formation .",
    "this would relax the assumption of equipartition , and replace the observational constraints with more physically motivated ones .",
    "for this step , calibration against results from ism - scale hydrodynamic simulations will be beneficial . a different avenue to pursue , in tandem or separately ,",
    "is to use our _ ramses _ patch to run large scale numerical simulations and to demonstrate its effect and applicability on cosmic scales .",
    "cosmological simulations today generally do not include the magnetic fields and cosmic rays , and do not always resolve turbulence , and our approach allows to circumvent this difficulty by using a simple effective parametrization .",
    "such simulations will naturally include realistic boundary conditions for the ism , namely the halo gas , and allow us to study its interactions with the ism and its effect on winds .",
    "ultimately , once large scale cosmological simulations are possible with all the necessary physics , a toy sub - grid model can also be calibrated directly to those simulations and used as a cheaper approximation for them .",
