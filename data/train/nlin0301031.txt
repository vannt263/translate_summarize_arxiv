    "the above approach has been widely used both in analytical and numerical studies of quantum billiards . in particular , it has been suggested by berry in @xcite to use the expansion ( [ 1.3 ] ) with a gaussian amplitude distribution to represent eigenfunctions of quantum systems with fully chaotic dynamics .",

    "_    the question naturally arises whether the same property holds for eigenstates of non - convex billiards , and thus , whether the pwdm can be actually applied to the class of non - convex billiards .",

    "such extension of @xmath35 into @xmath0 provides simultaneously solutions for the interior dirichlet problem ( when @xmath36 ) and for the exterior dirichlet problem ( when @xmath37 ) .",

    "the opposite , however , is not true : pw approximation for an eigenstate does not imply , in general , strong spectral duality .",
    "in fact , in @xcite the examples of convex billiards ( in this case the approximation by pw is possible ) have been constructed where the eigenstates extension into the exterior domain as @xmath43 functions is not possible .",

    "@xmath51 its continuation @xmath52 into the exterior domain will be the dual periodic trajectory of the exterior map . on the other hand , it is straightforward to see that in non - convex billiards interior - exterior duality breaks down . generally , in a non - convex billiard @xmath6 there exist interior periodic trajectories whose extension into the exterior domain intersects @xmath6 again , see fig .",

    "the main result of the present paper can be formulated in the following way .",
    "based on the breaking of interior - exterior duality we demonstrate that eigenstates of a generic non - convex billiard ( in general ) can not be approximated by regular solutions of eq . [ 1.1 ] . to illustrate the main idea of our approach",

    "it says that an infinite sequence ( possibly of zero density ) of such states exists .",
