    "the small quadrupole interaction of the order of tenths of khz leads to a negligible quadrupolar shift of the order of , i.e. 0.05 % of the magnetic hyperfine shift .",
    "moreover , since the orbital shifts are small , the major contribution to the shift comes from the hyperfine interaction between the cs and cu spins .",

    "low temperature spectra are broader than the excitation width of a typical rf pulse .",
    "therefore , to be able to saturate nuclear spin magnetization we had to sweep the frequency of the excitation pulses across the line .",
    "more precisely , the magnetization was saturated by applying a train of @xmath92 pulses equally spaced by a time @xmath93 at different frequencies across the line , as illustrated in .",
    "the length of pulses was varied depending on their frequency , in order to correctly account for the variation of @xmath92 pulse lengths for different satellite transitions @xcite . repeating this sequence for at least 10 times ensured a complete saturation of the nuclear magnetization . following the saturation pulse train ,",
    "the signal was detected after a variable delay time @xmath94 using a standard spin echo sequence .",
    "the length of the detection pulses was tuned so that only a signal from a narrow region around the peak of the spectra , _",

    "<S> we report @xmath0cs nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) measurements on the 2d frustrated heisenberg antiferromagnet cs@xmath1cucl@xmath2 down to @xmath3k and up to @xmath4 t . </S>",
    "<S> we show that @xmath0cs nmr is a good probe of the magnetic degrees of freedom in this material . </S>",
    "<S> cu spin degrees of freedom are sensed through a strong anisotropic hyperfine coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the spin excitation gap opens above the critical saturation field . </S>",
    "<S> the gap value was determined from the activation energy of the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate in a magnetic field applied parallel to the cu chains ( @xmath5 axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the @xmath6-factor and the saturation field are consistent with the neutron - scattering and magnetization results . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements of the spin - spin relaxation time are exploited to show that no structural changes occur down to the lowest temperatures investigated . </S>"
