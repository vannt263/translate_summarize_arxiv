    "continuous - time autoregressive moving average ( carma ) processes generalize the widely employed discrete - time arma process to a continuous - time setting .",
    "heuristically , a multivariate carma process of order @xmath4 can be thought of as a stationary solution @xmath5 of the linear differential equation @xmath6{\\boldsymbol{y}}(t ) = \\left[b_0+b_1{\\mathrm{d}}+\\ldots+b_q{\\mathrm{d}}^{q}\\right]{\\mathrm{d}}{\\boldsymbol{l}}(t),\\quad { \\mathrm{d}}=\\frac{{\\mathrm{d}}}{{\\mathrm{d}}t},\\quad p > q,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a lvy process and @xmath8 , @xmath9 are coefficient matrices , see [ section - mcarma ] for a precise definition .",
    "they first appeared in the literature in @xcite , where univariate gaussian carma processes were defined .",
    "recent years have seen a rapid development in both the theory and the applications of this class of stochastic processes ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite ,",
    "the restriction of gaussianity was relaxed and carma processes driven by lvy processes with finite moments of any order greater than zero were introduced ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this extension allowed for carma processes to have jumps as well as a wide variety of marginal distributions , possibly exhibiting fat tails .",
    "shortly after that , @xcite defined multivariate carma processes and thereby made it possible to model a set of dependent time series jointly by a single continuous - time linear process . further developments of the concept led to fractionally integrated carma ( ficarma , @xcite ) and superpositions of carma ( supcarma , @xcite ) processes , both allowing for long - memory effects . in many contexts",
    "continuous - time processes are particularly suitable for stochastic modelling because they allow for irregularly - spaced observations and high - frequency sampling .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for an overview of successful applications of carma processes in economics and mathematical finance .    despite the growing interest of practitioners in using carma processes as stochastic models for observed time series ,",
    "the statistical theory for such processes has received little attention in the past .",
    "one of the basic questions with regard to parameter inference or model selection is how to determine which particular member of a class of stochastic models best describes the characteristic statistical properties of an observed time series .",
    "if one decides to model a phenomenon by a carma process as in [ eq - defmcarmaheu ] , which can often be argued to be a reasonable choice of model class , this problem reduces to the three tasks of choosing suitable integers @xmath10 , @xmath11 describing the order of the process ; estimating the coefficient matrices @xmath8 , @xmath9 ; and suggesting an appropriate model for the driving lvy process @xmath7 .    in this paper",
    ", we address the last of these three problems and develop a method to estimate a parametric model for the driving lvy process of a multivariate carma process , building on an idea suggested in @xcite for the special case of a univariate carma process of order @xmath12 .",
    "the strategy is to observe that the distribution of a lvy process @xmath7 is uniquely determined by the distribution of the unit increments @xmath13 ; if one therefore had access to the increments @xmath14 over a sufficiently long time - horizon , one could easily estimate a model for @xmath7 by any of several well - established methods , including parametric as well as non - parametric approaches ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is thus natural to try and express the increments of the driving lvy process ",
    "at least approximately  in terms of the observed values of the carma process and subject this approximate sample from the unit - increment distribution to the same estimation method one would use with the true sample .",
    "one difficulty arising in this step is that one usually does not observe a carma processes continuously but that one instead only has access to its values on a discrete , yet possibly very fine , time grid ; in fact , as we shall see in [ section - recovery ] , it is this assumption of discrete - time observations that prevents us from exactly recovering the increments of the lvy process from the recorded carma process .    in this paper ,",
    "we concentrate on the parametric generalized moment estimators ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and prove that the estimate based on the reconstructed increments of @xmath7 has the same asymptotic distribution as the estimate based on the true increments , provided that both the length @xmath2 of the observation period and the sampling frequency @xmath15 , at which the carma process is recorded , go to infinity at the right rate . in fact we obtain the quantitative criterion that @xmath1 must be chosen dependent on @xmath2 such that @xmath16 converges to zero as @xmath2 tends to infinity .",
    "the generalized method of moments ( gmm ) estimators contain as special cases the classical maximum likelihood estimators as well as non - linear least squares estimators that are based on fitting the empirical characteristic function of the observed sample to its theoretical counterpart . in view of the structure of the lvy  khintchine formula ,",
    "the latter method is particularly suited for the estimation of l ' evy processes .",
    "we impose no assumptions on the driving lvy process except for the finiteness of certain moments that depend on the particular moment function used in the gmm approach . in our main result , [ theorem - gmmlevy ] , we prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of a wide class of gmm estimators that satisfy a set of mild standard technical assumptions .",
    "for some recent results about the estimation of discretely observed diffusion processes with jumps we refer the reader to @xcite and their references .",
    "the theory developed in these papers is not applicable to the problem of estimating the driving lvy process of a discretely observed mcarma process because mcarma processes are not , in general , diffusions .",
    "it seems possible to relax the assumption of uniform sampling as long as the maximal distance between two recording times in the observation interval tends to zero .",
    "more important , however , is the natural question if there exist methods to estimate the driving lvy process of a carma process that do not require high frequency sampling but still have desirable asymptotic properties .",
    "another interesting topic for further investigation is the behaviour of non - parametric estimators for the driving lvy process if they are used with a disturbed sample of the unit increments as described in this paper .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in [ section - mlp ]",
    "we take a closer look at multivariate lvy processes and infinitely divisible distributions , the fundamental ingredients in the definition of a multivariate carma process .",
    "first , we briefly review their definition and some important basic properties . in [ sec - absolutemoments ]",
    "we obtain a new quantitative bound for the absolute moments of an infinitely divisible distribution in terms of its characteristic triplet , which is essential for many of the subsequent proofs .",
    "we also derive the exact polynomial time - dependence of the absolute moments of a lvy process in [ prop - levymoments ] . as a further preparation for the proofs of our main results , [ theorem - fubini ] in [ sec - fubini ] establishes a fubini - type result for double integrals with respect to a lvy process over an unbounded domain .",
    "the definition of multivariate carma processes as well as important properties , such as moments , mixing and smoothness of sample paths , are presented in [ section - mcarma ] . in [ theorem - alternativessr ] , we prove an alternative state space representation for multivariate carma processes , called the controller canonical form , which lends itself more easily to the estimation of the driving lvy process than the original definition .    in [ section - recovery ] we show that , conditional on an initial value , whose influence decays exponentially , one can exactly recover the value of the driving lvy process from a continuous record of the multivariate carma process .",
    "the functional dependence is explicit and given in [ theorem - recoverydeltal ] .",
    "since such a continuous record is usually not available , [ section - dtestimation ] is devoted to discretizing the result found in [ theorem - recoverydeltal ] . to this end , we analyse how pathwise derivatives and definite integrals of lvy - driven carma processes can be approximated from observations on a discrete time grid , and we determine the asymptotic behaviour of these approximations as the mesh size tends to zero . to our knowledge , this is the first time that numerical differentiation and integration schemes are investigated quantitatively for this class of stochastic processes .",
    "the results of this section are summarized in [ theorem - levyapprox ] .    in [ sec - gmm ]",
    ", we prove consistency and asymptotic normality of the generalized method of moments estimator when the sample is not i.i.d@xmath17 but instead disturbed by a noise sequence , which corresponds to the discretization error from the previous section . shows that if the sampling frequency @xmath18 goes to infinity fast enough with the length @xmath2 of the observation interval , such that @xmath3 converges to zero , then the effect of the discretization becomes asymptotically negligible and the limiting distribution of the estimated parameter is identical to the one obtained from an unperturbed sample . finally , in [ theorem - gmmlevy ]",
    ", we apply this result to give an answer to the question of how to estimate a parametric model of the driving lvy process of a multivariate carma process if high - frequency observations are available .",
    "finally , we present the results of a simulation study for a gamma - driven carma(3,1 ) process in [ section - simulation ] .    contains auxiliary results and some technical proofs that complement the presentation of our results in the main part of the paper .      throughout the paper we use the following notation .",
