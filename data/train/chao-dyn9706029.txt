    "the nearly rectangular shape of the map implies that the slow manifold comprises areas of strong expansion ( the neighborhood of @xmath39 , where the map is vertical ) and contraction ( horizontal part of the map ) . in the course of its evolution a trajectory initiated in the vicinity of the saddle cycle executes a number of small - amplitude loops around the saddle cycle and then in one turn reaches the neighborhood of the stable limit cycle . whether the trajectory approaches the limit cycle like trajectory 3 performing small    transient loop or like trajectory 4 which makes a large loop depends on its position relative to a certain boundary trajectory 0 which can be identified with the point @xmath40 on the first return map where @xmath41 has a vertical tangent .",
    "analysis of @xmath41 in a small neighborhood of @xmath40 shows that the trajectory 0 is superunstable ; _ i.e. _ , the neighboring trajectories deviate from it faster than geometrically .",

    "[ fig03](c ) .",
    "one can see that for @xmath48 sufficiently small , @xmath49 is characterized by the power law @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "this implies an extreme divergence of trajectories which is also reflected in the phase portrait . the initial conditions @xmath52 on @xmath31 for trajectories 1 and 2 ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig03](a , b ) ) were such that @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "[ fig03 ] shows , the separation between these two trajectories on their return to the surface of section grows by @xmath55 orders of magnitude .",
    "in fact , trajectories 3 and 4 constitute another pair with @xmath56 .    the existence of the superunstable trajectory results in the observed dichotomy of trajectories belonging to the slow manifold . a 2d manifold intersecting the slow manifold along trajectory 0 plays similar separating role in the 3d phase space .",
    "although the global structure of this repulsive flow in the phase space is very complicated , the flow can be easily determined locally by the property that it separates trajectories making large and small loops while approaching the attractor .",
    "figure  [ fig05](a ) shows an expanded view of the flat part of the first return map @xmath41 in fig .",
    "[ fig03](c ) .",
    "the slope of the map is everywhere positive and , thus , the map is invertible . as @xmath9 decreases at constant @xmath25 , a smooth transformation of the slow manifold takes place , resulting in the loss of invertability of the map . a fragment of map constructed for @xmath57 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig05](b ) ) demonstrates that @xmath41 is not monotonic and a smooth maximum arises near the stable limit cycle . at @xmath58",
    "the map is tangent to the bisectrix and a new pair of stable and unstable limit cycles emerges on the slow manifold ( cf .",
    "[ fig05](c ) ) .",
    "as the map s maximum grows it sharpens and the newborn limit cycle looses its stability through a cascade of period - doubling bifurcations . at @xmath59 ( see fig .  [ fig05](d ) ) a chaotic attractor coexists with the period-1 limit cycle and focus .",
    "although the entire cascade to chaos occupies very narrow span of @xmath9 , two first period - doubling bifurcations were resolved .",
    "the tristability of the system breaks down at a certain value of @xmath9 and every trajectory initiated near the maximum of the map is attracted to the period-1 limit cycle after a chaotic transient of varying length .",
    "figure  [ fig05](e ) shows a part of the first return map for @xmath60 where oscillations suddenly crash on the focus .",
    "two important characteristic features of the flow can be inferred from the map .",
    "first , the maximum of the map acquires a cuspoid shape signalling of the formation of a highly compressed fold on the slow manifold .",
    "second , from the tangency of the map and bisectrix , one can see that the stable period-1 limit cycle and the large - amplitude saddle cycle are near the point of coalescence .",
    "the annihilation of this pair in a saddle - node bifurcation gives rise to an intermittent chaotic attractor which has the appearance of a thick limit cycle .",
    "a decrease in the control parameter @xmath9 leads to the crash of chaotic oscillations onto the focus . summarising the information presented in fig .",
    "[ fig05](a - e ) , one can conclude that as @xmath9 changes through the interval @xmath61 $ ] , the slow manifold transforms from a planar surface into a folded fractal structure with infinitely many leaves ( smale s horseshoe ) .    making use of several auxiliary poincar sections it is possible to construct a 3d picture of the slow manifold .",
    "figure  [ fig06 ] schematically represents the manifold and three of its poincar sections at parameters close to the crash bifurcation .",
    "part of the manifold situated between sections @xmath62 and @xmath63 is removed to facilitate visualization of its geometry . in section @xmath63",
    "one sees a triply - folded curve which corresponds to the first structural level of the manifold .",
    "note the difference between the two folds of this curve : while the outer fold has a smooth parabolic shape , the inner fold is a sharp cusp . increasing the resolution considerably ( by @xmath64 5 orders of magnitude )",
    "one would be able to find that the curve is , in fact , a densely compressed fold constituted by seven leaves of the second structural level , and so on . to describe one iteration of the manifold stretching and folding we do not need to consider these higher structural levels . following the evolution of points in section @xmath63 under the flow ( clockwise in fig .  [ fig06 ] ) one encounters a pleat where the manifold as a whole begins to fold into an @xmath1-shaped form ( section @xmath65 ) with two approximately equal parabolic folds .",
    "prominent stretching of the flow in the plane of the manifold ,    accompanied by strong contraction in the orthogonal direction , transforms the manifold into the thin roll composed of seven leaves seen in section @xmath62 . as a result of the extreme inhomogeneity of compression the inner fold acquires sharp cuspoid shape while the outer one remains smooth and parabolic . as the flow returns to section @xmath63 more contraction along the vertical direction occurs and the second order structure shown in section @xmath62 is not discernible .",
    "in sec .  [ shoe ] we described two important characteristic features of the phase flow of system ( [ sys ] ) .",
    "firstly , at the parameter values in the neighborhood of mixed - mode oscillations , the slow manifold is folded into a horseshoe - type set with a fractal , multi - leaved structure .",
    "secondly , the repulsive flow divides the transient trajectories into two distinct classes .",
    "intersection of the repulsive flow and the slow manifold yields a superunstable trajectory with peculiar dynamical properties . in the present section we show how mixed - mode states which correspond to periodic orbits embedded in the horseshoe emerge and bifurcate into each other .      consider a path in the @xmath13 parameter plane which starts in domain 2 or @xmath27 and ends in the region of mixed - mode oscillations 3 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] ) . as the domain of large - amplitude period-1 oscillations",
    "is traversed towards the curve corresponding to the @xmath66 transition , the modifications of the slow manifold described in sec .",
    "[ shoe2 ] take place . before the first mixed - mode is formed an important transformation of the manifold occurs at the point where a cusp - shaped fold developes .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] shows that the manifold can not support periodic oscillations with small - amplitude loops since its folded part lies on the `` large - amplitude '' side of the repulsive flow ( only the superunstable trajectory is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] ) . in order for orbits with both small- and large - amplitude excursions",
    "to exist , the repulsive flow has to intersect the folded part of the horseshoe .",
    "figure  [ fig07 ] shows segments of the manifolds cut out by two orthogonal planes for three consequtive values of @xmath9 and fixed @xmath10 .",
    "the case @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ fig07](a ) ) corresponds to the generic transversal position of the manifolds in which the growing fold of the horseshoe lies on one side of the repulsive flow .",
    "this case is described by a first return map of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig05](d ) . at @xmath68 , in addition to the transversal intersection , a tangency between the two manifolds occurs .",
    "the tangency manifests itself by the formation of a sharp cusp on the first return map ( see fig .  [ fig05](e ) ) . for @xmath69",
    "the fold of the horseshoe penetrates the surface corresponding to the repulsive flow    and drastically increases in size due to the strong divergence from the repulsive flow .",
    "one also sees in fig .",
    "[ fig07](c ) that as a result of this transformation two new superunstable orbits ( thick solid lines ) are born on the slow manifold . taking into the consideration fractal nature of the horseshoe one could imagine an infinite stack of superunstable orbits born in pairs when nested folds of the horseshoe penetrate the surface of the repulsive flow one by one .",
    "the birth of new superunstable orbits is reflected in the first return map as well .",
    "figure  [ fig08 ] shows the first return map constructed with @xmath31 as a surface of section as described in sec .",
    "[ shoe1 ] for parameter values @xmath70 at which the transition @xmath71 occurs .",
    "as @xmath72 is passed , the cusp on the map breaks up and the maximum acquires normal parabolic shape . at the same time the height of the maximum increases tremendously and two segments with infinite slope appear on its sides .",
    "the analysis of the map shows that the transition @xmath73 occurs simultaneously with annihilation of the large - amplitude stable and saddle - type limit cycles . at the point of coalescence",
    "they produce structurally unstable limit cycle which is seen on the first return map as a point of tangency with bisectrix .",
    "this cycle combines properties of both stable and unstable limit cycles .",
    "consider a trajectory which departs from such cycle at @xmath74 .",
    "in course of evolution it inevitably executes    one small - amplitude loop around the focus . upon the completion of this loop",
    "the trajectory is reinjected into the stable part of the neighborhood of the cycle which is eventually approached at @xmath75 .",
    "thus , first mixed - mode state @xmath76 is characterized by the orbit homoclinic to the structurally unstable cycle and , therefore , exists in a parameter domain of zero measure . for @xmath77 a finite number of large - amplitude loops is executed before a trajectory visits the small loop and successions of @xmath78 mixed - mode states with rapidly decreasing @xmath79 are oserved .",
    "it is possible to establish how a particular mixed - mode orbit is incorporated in the slow manifold .",
    "figure  [ fig09 ] shows the @xmath24 projection of a @xmath80 orbit and its embedding in the horseshoe . as in fig .",
    "[ fig06 ] , the poincar sections of the manifold are shown at different levels of resolution of the fine structure . while section @xmath63 presents the first two structural levels , in section @xmath65 only first level is shown in full .",
    "two lines of phase points parallel to the surface of the repulsive flow and separated from it by @xmath81 are selected in section @xmath63 ( long dashes ) .",
    "the evolution of these points shown in section @xmath65 demonstrates the extreme divergence of trajectories caused by the presence of the repulsive flow .",
    "orbit @xmath82 consists of a dense , flat band of large - amplitude loops which consecutively shrink in size and a small loop where the trajectory segment is reinjected into the large - amplitude band .",
    "projecting points in which the orbit intersects planes @xmath63 and @xmath65 ( shown by thick dots ) on the corresponding poincar sections of the horseshoe one can obtain insight into the mechanism of this reinjection . at a certain time the trajectory appears to the left of the repulsive flow surface ( point 1 in @xmath63 ) .",
    "this causes it to execute a small loop ( point 2 on the cusp - shaped tongue in @xmath65 ) .",
    "next return of the trajectory into section @xmath63 occurs in point 3 , separated far from 1 .",
    "following the subsequent numbers one sees how the orbit returns to the large - amplitude band , gradually ascending leaves of the slow manifold .",
    "the same mechanism holds for all @xmath83    states , although escape on the small loop occurs from different leaves .",
    "the analysis of the reinjection scheme shows that the horseshoe ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig09 ] ) can not support mixed - mode oscillations with more than one small - amplitude loop .",
    "indeed , regardless of how far to the left one shifts the position of point 1 , first return of a trajectory initiated at 1 into the surface of section ( point 3 ) lies to the right of the repulsive flow .",
    "this situation changes as the cusp - shaped tongue , to which point 3 belongs , penetrates the surface of the repulsive flow through the formation of a tangency as described in sec .",
    "( corresponding changes on both sections are shown by medium - dashed lines . )",
    "as soon as a similar tongue of a higher structural level passes through the surface of the repulsive flow , an opportunity for the existence of the third small - amplitude loop arises , and so on .",
    "thus , changing position of the horseshoe relative to the repulsive flow one can obtain mixed - mode states @xmath23 with any desired @xmath0 and @xmath1 .      at small values of @xmath10 , where the bulk of the mixed - mode domain lies , the surface - of - section @xmath31 introduced in sec .",
    "[ shoe1 ] becomes unsuitable for the construction of the first return map due to the strongly bent shape of the corresponding poincar section ( see section @xmath65 in fig .",

    "[ fig09 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig10 ] presents two examples of the first return map @xmath85 constructed in the approximation based on the upper leaf of the horseshoe for parameter values corresponding to @xmath86 ( a ) and @xmath87 ( b ) mixed - mode states .    as one can see , maps of this type share a number of common features .",
    "the map consists of two branches with positive slope and an extremely steep , negatively - inclined segment which joins the branches . at the point corresponding to the superunstable orbit the map has an infinite slope and",

    "although the dynamic origin of such maps was not discussed , a possible relation of the z - map to the existence of mixed - mode oscillations was inferred .",
    "one can easily see that the z - map in its @xmath93 limit is qualitatively similar to the map @xmath94 constructed in the present section . in our map the middle segment is always vertical due to the presence of the superunstable orbit . applying results of ringland _ et .",
    "to system ( 1 ) , we may assume that the repulsive flow defines not only the shape of mixed - mode orbits with their nonoverlapping bands of small- and large - amplitude loops , but also their property to form farey sequences .",
    "we have analyzed in detail a model exhibiting mixed - mode oscillations . by constructing the model s slow manifold",
    "we have shown that mixed - modes correspond to periodic orbits embedded in a horseshoe - type strange set .",

    "the organization of the slow manifold into a horseshoe also accounts for the signatures of chaos in transient trajectories when the attractor is periodic .    in our model the mixed - mode periodic orbits",
    "do not lie on a 2-torus . following transformations of the slow manifold from its simple planar organization into a horseshoe",
    ", we have also shown that a torus does not exist as an intermediate state between period-1 and mixed - mode oscillations .",
    "thus , our scenario for the emergence of mixed - mode oscillations is an alternative to quasiperiodicity .",
    "the main distinctive feature of mixed - mode states , the partition of their orbits into nonoverlapping bands of small- and large - amplitude loops , finds its explanation in the existence of the repulsive flow .",
    "intersection of this flow with the slow manifold yields a complex system of superunstable orbits .",
    "the position of the slow manifold relative to the repulsive flow determines whether the formation of small or large loops of the attractor is favored . as parameters change along a path running through the mixed - mode domain , the position of the repulsive flow changes and one observes sequences of mixed - mode states @xmath95 with monotonously increasing ( decreasing ) @xmath96 ratio . as the results of ringland _ et.al .",
    "_ @xcite suggest , the fact that these sequences are described by farey arithmetic is also a consequence of the presence of the superunstable orbits .",
    "thus , the existence of the repulsive flow places this horseshoe into a separate subclass of strange sets whose periodic orbits are given by @xmath23 mixed - mode states , and whose windows of periodicity are organized into farey sequences .",
    "there exist indications that our scenario may account for the mixed - mode oscillations observed in a number of model and experimental studies .",
