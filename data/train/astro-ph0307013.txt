    "the dynamical state of the interstellar medium ( ism ) remains relatively poorly understood , especially in the presence of magnetic fields . whilst the complexity of the topic still precludes a single all - encompassing model ,",
    "there are many aspects of the problem that can now be addressed by well - designed numerical simulations .",
    "recent 3d models of relevance include those of korpi et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) , and of de avillez ( 2000 ) , de avillez & mac low ( 2002 ) .",
    "these models focus on small cartesian boxes , with typical side - lengths of order @xmath1 , rather that addressing the full galactic disc . for similar reasons of computational resolution , none attempt to model all of the phases of gas present , from the hottest ionized plasma ( with density @xmath2 , temperature @xmath3 to the cold molecular clouds ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 . and",
    "each of the models neglects or simplifies some aspects of the physics of the problem ; at this early stage of study , that is to be expected .",
    "the current model  a development of the earlier work of korpi et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) , already partially reported in shukurov et al .",
    "( 2003 )  focuses in particular on the dynamics of the hot ism gas , under the interaction of supernova ( sn ) driving with classical magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) forces .",
    "we model a relatively small box ( of horizontal cross - section @xmath6 ) , symmetric about the galactic mid - plane ( @xmath7 ) ; this is nevertheless large enough to follow the evolution of turbulent ism structures on observable scales .",
    "we neglect the very coldest gas , focusing on the warm , hot and ionized phases ( @xmath8 k ) .",
    "this choice retains enough cold gas to fit a major fraction of the mass into a small fraction of the volume  allowing interesting 3d structures to form  but allows us to run with a relatively coarse resolution of @xmath9 .",
    "consistent with this restriction , we do not incorporate self - gravity into our solution , instead assuming the fixed vertical gravity profile from ferrire ( 1998 ) . beyond the fine details ,",
    "the numerical model is essentially as described in brandenburg et al .",
    "the treatment of the thermodynamics , adapted for the ism problem , is largely as in korpi et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) ; this approach is indebted to earlier work in 2d ( e.g. passot , vsquez - semadeni & pouquet , 1995 ; gazol - patio & passot , 1999 ) .",
    "the radiative cooling function , @xmath10 , is that given by rosen , bregman & norman ( 1993 ) ( after that of chiang & bregman , 1998 ) , truncated at @xmath11 to avoid the gas evolving towards the colder phases we wish to neglect .",
    "heating by uv absorption , @xmath12 , is imposed with a net heating rate of @xmath13 for temperatures @xmath14 ( e.g. wolfire et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "this is not a major energy input , but again helps to prevent gas from cooling and contracting into phases we do not aim to resolve .",
    "we assume a fixed fraction of helium of 8% ( by number ) , and a fixed ionization fraction of 0.7 , in implementing these two parameterisations .",
    "the principal driving is the supernova heating @xmath15 , which is implemented by the occasional , instantaneous , input of @xmath16 .",
    "this energy is locally distributed with a normalised profile of form @xmath17 , at distance @xmath18 about the sn location ; this profile , with the width taken as @xmath19 , permits adequate numerical resolution .",
    "the internal energy then evolves naturally ; some remains in thermal form or is lost to radiative cooling , some is transformed to kinetic and magnetic energy by normal gas dynamic and mhd processes .",
    "we find this scheme works well , with one refinement . in gas above a certain density , injecting @xmath20 in this way distributes the energy over a significant total mass ; the central gas is then insufficiently heated , compared with the point - source energy injection we are trying to model . the resultant state undergoes rapid radiative cooling , losing too much energy this way , and converting an unrealistically small amount to kinetic energy by pressure - driven expansion . to avoid this problem",
    ", we model the initial phase of sn expansion by creating a cavity of width @xmath21 of low density gas , and moving the original mass to a symmetric shell beyond this .",
    "tests on the subsequent evolution show that sedov - type expansion is well replicated , and both energy and mass are well conserved . with the sn heating implemented in this way , about 15% of the injected energy",
    "is typically transformed to kinetic energy .",
    "we determine sn frequency and location using the following scheme from gudiksen ( 1999 ) .",
    "( although again , the method has antecedents : e.g.  bania & lyon , 1980 ; passot et al . , 1995 . ) we identify regions with @xmath22 , @xmath23 as clouds , and only permit sn  ii within such clouds .",
    "the mass of gas in such regions , @xmath24 , is monitored , and the instantaneous sn  ii frequency , @xmath25 , is taken as @xmath26 here @xmath27 is the gas mass fraction converted into stars ( cf .",
    "wilson & matthews , 1995 ) ; @xmath28 is the fraction of the stellar mass in sn progenitors , obtained from a suitable initial mass function ( e.g. padoan et al . , 1997 ) ; @xmath29 is the sn progenitor mass ; and @xmath30 is the appropriate gas recycling time ( or ` cloud lifetime ' ) .",
    "we emphasise that this formula , derived on physical grounds , results in a sn driving that is self - regulating , with feedback from the evolving 3d structure ; the simulations evolve towards some equilibrium sn  ii rate , which becomes a testable output rather than a fixed input parameter .",
    "( although some calibration was performed to obtain an appropriate value for @xmath31 ; see below . )",
    "the location of the sne is chosen from those positions satisfying the criteria above , with the probability at any position being proportional to the local density ; sn  ii thus end up concentrated in the densest regions , as is realistic .",
    "our model also retains an appropriate ( small ) number of type  i sne , implemented with fixed temporal and spatial probabilities , as in korpi et al .",
    "( 1999a ) ; these do not play a large role in the solution , however .",
    "we have run simulations with three different mean densities , chosen to model the ism in regions within and between spiral arms , as well as for an average value ; these are identified as the arm ( high @xmath32 ) , interarm ( low @xmath32 ) and average cases , and their respective initial mid - plane densities , @xmath33 , are given in table  [ tab : rho ] .",
    "the runs were started in hydrostatic equilibrium , using the density stratification profile of ferrire ( 1998 ) , but scaled by the density @xmath33 .",
    "after of order 2040 myr of evolution , the system attains a convincing statistical equilibrium .",
    "the time sequences shown in figure  [ fig : time ] show the variations of the instantaneous sn  ii frequency after this initial period ."
