    "[ fig : pyramid ] , that possess a long dendritic trunk separating mainly excitatory synapses at the apical dendritic tree from mainly inhibitory synapses at the soma and at the perisomatic basal dendritic tree @xcite .",
    "in addition , they exhibit an axial symmetry and are aligned in parallel to each other , perpendicular to the cortex surface , thus forming a palisade of cell bodies and dendritic trunks . when both kinds of synapses are simultaneously active , inhibitory synapses generate current sources and excitatory synapses current sinks in extracellular space , hence causing the pyramidal cell to behave as a microscopic dipole surrounded by its characteristic electrical field , the _ dendritic field potential ( dfp)_. the densely packed pyramidal cells form then a dipole layer whose superimposed currents give rise to the _ local field potential ( lfp ) _ of neural masses and eventually to the eeg @xcite .",

    "dendritic current @xmath0 causes dendritic field potential ( dfp).,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    despite of the progress from experimental neuroscience , theoretically understanding the coupling of complex neural network dynamics to the electromagnetic field in the extracellular space poses challenging problems ; some of them have been addressed to some extent by @xcite , and @xcite .    in computer simulation studies , neural mass potentials , such as lfp and eeg",
    "are most realistically simulated by means of multicompartmental models @xcite .",
    "calculated the current dipole momentum of the dfp for single pyramidal and stellate cells , based on several hundreds compartments of the dendritic trees .",
    "their results were in compliance with the standard dipole approximation of the electrostatic multipole expansion in the far - field ( more than 1 mm remote from the dendritic trunk ) , but they found rather poor agreement with that approximation in the vicinity of the cell body .",
    "for comparison they also computed a `` two - monopole '' model of one synaptic current and its counterpart , the somatic return current , estimated from the current dipole momentum of the whole dendritic tree .",
    "this `` two - monopole '' model , which corresponds to an electrically equivalent single dipole model , obtained from the decomposition of the dendrite into two compartments , better approximates the true current dipole momentum in the vicinity of the pyramidal neuron . by superimposing the dfps of pyramidal cells to the ensemble lfp",
    ", @xcite found that lfp properties can not be attributed to the far - field dipole approximation .",
    "however , realistic multicompartmental models are computationally too expensive for large - scale neural network simulations .",
    "therefore , various techniques have been proposed and employed to overcome computational complexity .",
    "these include networks of point models ( i.e. devoid from any spatial representation ) , based on conductance models @xcite , population density models @xcite , or firing rate models  @xcite , which can be seen as a sub class of population density models , with uniform density distribution @xcite . in these kinds of models ,",
    "mass potentials such as lfp or eeg are conventionally described as averaged membrane potential . a different class of models are neural mass models @xcite , where mass potentials are estimated either through sums ( or actually differences ) of postsynaptic potentials @xcite or of postsynaptic currents @xcite .",
    "in particular , the model of @xcite which is based on @xcite , recently led to a series of follow - up studies @xcite addressing the correlations between numerically simulated and experimentally measured lfp / eeg with spike rates by means of statistical modeling and information theoretic measures . in all of the above point models and their extension to population models",
    ", it is assumed that the extracellular space is iso - potential and the majority of studies thereby neglect the effect of extracellular resistance .",
    "that is , the extracellular space constitutes a different and isolated domain with no effect on neuronal dynamics .    in this article",
    "we extend the _ ad hoc _ model of @xcite towards a biophysically better justified approach , taking the dipole character of extracellular currents and fields into account .",
    "basically , our model corresponds to the `` two - monopole '' , or , equivalent dipole model of @xcite which gave a good fit of the dfp close to the cell body of a cortical pyramidal neuron .",
    "however , we aim to keep the simplicity of the @xcite model in terms of computational complexity , by endowing the extracellular space with resistance and by keeping point - like neuronal circuits .",
    "that is , in our case we do not quite consider point neurons , nor spatially extended models with detailed compartmental morphology , yet an intermediate level of description is achieved . to this end",
    "we propose a _ reduced three - compartmental model _ of a single pyramidal neuron @xcite , and derive an observation model for the dendritic dipole currents in the extracellular space and thereby for the dfp that contributes to the lfp of a neural population .",
    "interestingly , our reduced three - compartmental model enables us to derive a leaky integrate - and - fire mechanism ( as for a point model @xcite ) , with additional observation equations for the dfp , which all together allows to study the relationship between spike rates and lfp .",
    "our derivations also nicely map realistic electrotonic parameters to phenomenological parameters considered in @xcite .",
    "consider three populations of neurons , namely excitatory cortical pyramidal cells ( population 1 ) , inhibitory cortical interneurons ( population 2 ) and excitatory thalamic relay neurons ( population 3 ) , passing sensory input to the cortex that is simulated by a random ( erds - rnyi ) graph of @xmath1 pyramidal and @xmath2 interneurons with connection probability @xmath3 .",

    "note we show the full spectrum up to @xmath139 only for convenience due to the fine sample rate.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    one interesting feature is that the power spectrum of the @xcite lfp measures decays much more slowly that the average membrane potential for higher frequencies .",
    "this observation is true for both , @xmath134 and @xmath136 .",
    "in contrast , our lfp measures @xmath138 and @xmath135 fare better , and in particular , @xmath135 decays at an approximately similar rate as the average membrane potential .",
    "in this article we derived a model for cortical dipole fields , such as dendritic and local field potential ( dfp / lfp ) from biophysical principles . to that aim",
    "we decomposed a cortical pyramidal cell , the putative generator of those potentials , into three compartments : the apical dendritic tree as the place of mainly excitatory ( ampa ) synapses , the soma and the perisomatic dendritic tree as the place of mainly inhibitory ( gaba ) synapses and the axon hillock as the place of wave - to - spike conversion by means of an integrate - and - fire mechanism . from kirchhoff s laws governing an electronic equivalent circuit of our model , we were then able to derive the evolution equation for neural network activity eq .",
    "( [ eq : lineuron2 ] ) and , in addition , an observation equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : dfc2 ] ) for the dendritic dipole potential contributing to the lfp of a cortical population .    in order to compare our approach with another model discussed in the recent literature @xcite we aligned the parameters of our model with the model of @xcite who approximated dfp as the sum of moduli of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents eq .",
    "( [ eq : mazodfp ] ) . from both approaches",
    ", we computed four different lfp estimates : @xmath134 , the sum of @xcite dfp , @xmath136 , the population average of @xcite dfp , @xmath138 the sum of our dipole dfp , and @xmath135 the population average of our dipole dfp [ eqs . ( [ eq : lfp1 ]  [ eq : lfp4 ] ) ] .",
    "our results indicate two main effects between our dipole lfp measures and those of @xcite firstly , the measures based on @xcite systematically overestimate lfp amplitude by almost one order of magnitude .",
    "one reason for that could be attributed to the direct conversion of synaptic current into voltage without taking extracellular conductivity into account , as properly done in our approach . yet , another , even more crucial reason is disclosed by our equivalent circuit fig .  [",
    "fig : eqcirc ] . in our approach",
    "there is just _",
    "one _ extracellular current @xmath0 flowing from the perisomatic to the apical dendritic tree . in the model of @xcite , however , two synaptic currents that might be of the same order of magnitude are superimposed to the dfp . secondly , the measures based on @xcite also systematically overestimate lfp frequencies .",
    "this could probably be attributed partly to spurious higher harmonics introduced by computing absolute values . moreover , taking the power spectrum shows that the @xcite measure decays much more slowly than the average membrane potential , which is at variance with experimental data .",
    "however , at the current stage , both models , that of @xcite and our own , agree with respect to the polarity of dfp and lfp .",
    "the measures based on @xcite have positive polarity simply due to the moduli .",
    "on the other hand , also the direction of current dipoles in our model is constrained by the construction of the equivalent circuit fig .",
    "[ fig : eqcirc ] where current sources are situated at the perisomatic and current sinks are situated at apical dendritc tree . taking this polarity as positive also entails positive dfp and lfp that could only change in strength .",
    "however , it is well known from brain anatomy that pyramidal cells appear in at least two layers , iii and vi , of neocortex .",
    "this is reflected in experiments when an electrode traverses different layers by lfp polarity reversals , and , of course , by the fact that lfp and eeg oscillate between positive and negative polarity .",
    "adapting our model to this situation could be straightforwardly accomplished in the framework of neural field theory by fully representing space and simulating layered neural fields @xcite .",
    "by contrast such a generalization is impossible at all with the model of @xcite due to the presence of absolute values .    on theses grounds we have good indication that our measure is an improvement to the @xcite lfp measures , and , quite importantly , it is biophysically better motivated than the _ ad hoc _ model of @xcite",
    "however , much considerable effort is still required to underpin all the relevant lfp mechanisms and to better represent experimental lfp / eeg dynamics .",
    "finally , our work provides a new framework where dendritic field potentials and the relationship between firing rates and local fields can be explored without the extreme demand on computational complexity involved in multicompartmental modeling @xcite by adopting reduced compartment circuits .",
    "for example , we envisage to extend our recent work which maps firing rate model ( derived from lif models ) to population density models @xcite , but now incorporating our observational dfp model . in addition , our framework is analytically amenable and thus can be applied to any linear differential equation , for instance , gif ( gif - sur - yvette integrate fire ) models , which are improvements to the lif models and compute more accurately spike activations @xcite .",
    "also resonant membranes ( mediated by @xmath140 and a @xmath140-activated @xmath141 ionic currents ) that describe sub - threshold oscillations and which can be easily expressed by linear equations  @xcite can be incorporated in our derivations .",
    "we note however that our framework can be applied to non - linear equations , with @xcite type activation , but it will fall short from explicit and analytical observation equations .",
