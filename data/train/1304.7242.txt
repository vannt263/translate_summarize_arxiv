    "the disorder model used in our calculations neglects scattering from short - range atomic defects and ripples .",
    "this approach is justified by the long - range ( compared to the atomic lattice ) nature of the coulomb - like charged impurities .    after choosing the average charge density @xmath13 we introduce local variations in the charge density either through randomness of the on - site carrier density at each lattice point @xmath14 or from ionized impurities near the graphene plane . in the first case ,",

    "note that the square root means that the contributions to the potential do not add arithmetically . in this simple model the random on - site component dominates at low carrier density and its contribution diminishes as the overall charge density increases .",
    "although our approach overestimates screening at the interface of hole - rich / electron - rich regions , the charge of the scatterers is chosen to yield an rms charge density in agreement with the observed charged puddles .",

    "a reduction of the amplitude of the fluctuations was seen in monolayer graphene devices@xcite contrasting with a study@xcite in which the amplitude of the fluctuations is larger at the charge neutrality point for both monolayer and bilayer graphene devices .",
    "our calculations , covering a broad range of impurity strengths and concentrations , finds that the amplitude of the conductance fluctuations at the dirac point for sufficiently strong fluctuations in the carrier density @xmath33 exhibits a peak .",
    "in contrast , the cf decrease at exactly the dirac point for weak on - site density fluctuations .    the suppression of the cf in weakly disordered systems is due to the reduced size of the fluctuations in the cleaner systems coupled to a reduced number of modes open to conduct  @xcite .",
