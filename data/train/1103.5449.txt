    "preparing a desired pure state , particularly under influence of dissipation , is clearly a most important subject in quantum information technologies . to tackle this problem , other than some well - acknowledged strategies such as quantum error correction",
    ", recently we have a totally different method that rather utilizes dissipation @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to engineer a dissipative system so that the system state @xmath0 governed by the corresponding markovian master equation @xmath1         + \\sum_{k=1}^m \\big (              \\hat l_k \\hat\\rho \\hat l_k^\\dagger                -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat l_k^\\dagger \\hat l_k \\hat\\rho                  -\\frac{1}{2 } \\hat\\rho \\hat l_k^\\dagger",

    "approach is that the dissipation - induced state @xmath8 is robust against any perturbation and thus may serve as a desired state , e.g. , an entangled state for quantum computation @xcite and quantum repeater @xcite .",
    "therefore , a complete characterization of the master equation having a unique pure steady state should be of great use , and actually in the finite - dimensional case it was given by kraus et al . @xcite . in particular",
    ", they showed that some useful pure states including cluster states can be prepared by _ quasi - local _ dissipative process , i.e. , dissipative channels that act only on a small number of subsystems .    in this research direction the infinite - dimensional counterpart of the above - mentioned state preparation method should be explored . in particular , gaussian states constitute a wide and important class of quantum states , which serve as the basis for various continuous - variable ( cv ) quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the contribution of this paper is to provide some necessary and sufficient conditions for the master equation to have a unique pure steady state , when @xmath4 and @xmath5 are of general form for @xmath0 to be gaussian for all @xmath9 .",
    "the conditions are described by simple matrix equations , thus they can be properly applied to the above - mentioned environment engineering problem for pure gaussian state preparation .",
    "actually , one of those conditions enables us to obtain a complete parameterization of the gaussian master equation that uniquely has a pure steady state .",
    "this leads to a systematic procedure for constructing a dissipative system deterministically yielding a desired pure gaussian state .",
    "we provide some examples of dissipation - induced states including the so - called gaussian cluster states @xcite , which are known as essential resources for the cv one - way quantum computing @xcite , with focusing on how they can actually be prepared by quasi - local dissipative process .",
    "we here provide the phase space representation of the general gaussian dissipative system with @xmath10-degrees of freedom , which is subjected to the master equation .",
    "let @xmath11 be the canonical conjugate pair of the @xmath12-th subsystem .",
    "it then follows from the canonical commutation relation @xmath13=i \\delta _ { ij}$ ] that the vector of system variables @xmath14 satisfies @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the @xmath17 identity matrix and @xmath18 the matrix transpose . a gaussian state is completely characterized by only the mean vector @xmath19 and the ( symmetrized ) covariance matrix @xmath20 . here",
    "the mean @xmath21 , with @xmath22 the corresponding gaussian density operator , is taken elementwise ; e.g. , @xmath23 .",
    "the uncertainty relation is represented by the matrix inequality @xmath24 , thus @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "note also that the purity of a gaussian state is simply given by @xmath26 . now consider eq .   with @xmath4 and @xmath5 given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the parameter matrix and vector specifying the dissipative system .",

    ".    now suppose that @xmath40 is _ hurwitz _ ; i.e. , all the eigenvalues of @xmath40 have negative real parts .",
    "this is equivalent to that the system has a unique steady state ; it is gaussian with mean @xmath41 and covariance matrix @xmath42 that is a unique solution to the following matrix equation : @xmath43 note that @xmath42 can be explicitly represented as @xmath44 the purpose of this paper is , as mentioned before , to fully characterize a gaussian master equation that has a unique pure steady state , and this is now expressed in terms of eq . by @xmath45 .",
    "however , clearly this is not useful . in the next section",
    "we give a much simpler and explicit version of such a characterization .",
    "here we address our first main result :    _ theorem 1 _ : suppose that eq .",

    "_ lemma 1 _ : suppose that eq .",
    "has a unique solution .",

    "then , noting that @xmath40 and @xmath56 are written by @xmath57 $ ] and @xmath58 , we have @xmath59 , and this is contradiction to @xmath60 .",
    "thus @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath61    _ proof of theorem 1 _ : the proof is divided into four steps .    .",
    "from the williamson theorem @xcite a covariance matrix @xmath30 corresponding to a pure state is expressed by @xmath62 with @xmath63 a symplectic matrix @xcite . thus substituting @xmath64 for eq . , multiplying it by @xmath65 from the left and by @xmath66 from the right , and finally using this equation twice to erase @xmath67 , we have @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "note @xmath71 .",
    "thus @xmath72 , which immediately leads to @xmath73 and @xmath74 . from these equations",

    ", we get @xmath76 . repeating this",
    "manipulation yields @xmath77 with @xmath78 defined in eq . .",
    "this readily leads to @xmath79 , thus @xmath80 .",
    "the cayley - hamilton theorem implies eq . .    .",
    "define the @xmath81 matrix @xmath82 , then the real and imaginary parts of eq .",
    "are summarized in a single equation as @xmath83 now , from the assumption , we can use lemma  1 and find @xmath84 .",
    "then multiplying the above equation by @xmath85 ( the generalized inverse matrix of @xmath86 ) from the right , we have @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "now let us verify that eq .",
    "is symmetric . noting that eq . is equivalent to @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 then multiplying this equation by @xmath92 from the left and by @xmath93 from the right , we obtain @xmath94 thus @xmath95 .",
    "first , to show that the state is pure , we use the fact @xcite that , for a pure gaussian state , the corresponding covariance matrix @xmath30 satisfies @xmath96 now multiply eq . by @xmath92 from the left and by @xmath97 from the right , then we have @xmath98 this equation readily implies that @xmath42 given by eq .",

    "satisfies eq . .",

    "moreover , eq . leads to @xmath103 and @xmath104 ; from these equations we have @xmath105 , and as now @xmath106 is real and @xmath107 , we obtain eq . .",
    "as a result , @xmath42 satisfies eqs . and , but these two equations correspond to a specific decomposition of eq . .",
    "that is , @xmath42 is the solution to eq . .",
    "@xmath61    we give an interpretation of theorem  1 .",
    "let @xmath108 be the pure density operator corresponding to the covariance matrix @xmath42 .",
    "then eqs . and",
    "are equivalent to @xmath109=0,\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the former condition is further equivalent to that @xmath110 is parallel to @xmath111 for all @xmath7 , where @xmath112 .",
    "this means that @xmath113 is the so - called _ dark state _ ; that is , eqs . and are the phase space representation of the condition for the state to be dark .",
    "moreover , the uniqueness of @xmath113 allows us to erase itself in eq . and obtain a single equation with respect to @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the phase space representation of this equation is no more than eq .  .",
    "it should be maintained that @xmath113 is explicitly represented in a directly computable form .",
    "next let us discuss how to use theorem  1 , particularly for the purpose of environment engineering .",
    "first , note that eq .",
    "depends only on the system matrices @xmath67 and @xmath114 ; thus the condition ( iii ) should be applied , for a given specific system configuration , to find the system parameters such that the corresponding master equation has a unique pure steady state . on the other hand , the condition ( ii ) explicitly contains @xmath42 ; this means that we can characterize the structure of a dissipative system such that a desired pure state with covariance matrix @xmath42 is generated by that dissipative process .",
    "later we provide a modification of the condition ( ii ) that can be more suitably used to find such a dissipative system .",
    "we here give two examples to explain how the theorem is used .",
    "_ example 1 : single opo_. let us first study an ideal optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) , which couples with a vacuum field through one of the end - mirrors .",
    "the hamiltonian is described in terms of the annihilation operator @xmath115 and the creation operator @xmath116 as @xmath117 , where @xmath118 denotes effective complex pump intensity proportional to @xmath119 coefficient of the nonlinear crystal .",
    "also the coupling operator is given by @xmath120 with @xmath121 the damping rate of the cavity .",
    "the corresponding matrices @xmath122 then take the following form : @xmath123 from theorem 1 , the steady state of this system becomes pure if and only if @xmath124 that is , the dissipative process brought about by the coupling to the outer vacuum field must introduce decoherence to the intra - cavity state as long as it is squeezed ( @xmath125 ) . actually , when @xmath126 the steady covariance matrix turns out to be @xmath127 . in conclusion ,",
    "a single - mode intra - cavity state can become pure only when it is the trivial vacuum ( or coherent ) state .",
    "_ example 2 : cascaded opos_. we next consider the two - mode opos shown in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , where the opos are connected through a unidirectional optical field .",
    "this kind of cascaded system plays an important role in building a quantum information network ; e.g. , entanglement distribution was discussed in @xcite .",
    "the physical setup of each opo is the same as before , i.e. , @xmath128 and @xmath129 @xmath130 with @xmath131 and @xmath132 each cavity modes . for simplicity",
    "we here set the squeezing effectiveness of each cavity to be real ; @xmath133 . from the theory of cascaded systems @xcite , the hamiltonian and the coupling operator of the whole two - mode gaussian system",
    "are respectively given by @xmath134 hence the corresponding system matrices read @xmath135 then @xmath136 has eigenvalues @xmath137 , thus it is hurwitz when @xmath138 .",
    "equivalently , when both the opos are below threshold , the steady state is unique",
    ". then from the condition ( iii ) of theorem  1 the steady state is pure if and only if @xmath139 where @xmath140 .",
    "therefore , the system should be engineered to satisfy @xmath141 to have a unique pure steady state . from eq .",
    "( [ purev ] ) the corresponding covariance matrix is given by @xmath142 where @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "thus the steady state is a nontrivial entangled pure state other than the vacuum when @xmath145 .",
    "actually the _ logarithmic negativity _",
    "@xcite , which is a convenient computable measure for entanglement , takes a positive value ; @xmath146 we again stress that this dissipation - induced entangled state is guaranteed to be highly robust .",
    "that is , any initial state @xmath147 converges into that entangled state .",
    "such robustness can be clearly observed from fig .  1  ( b ) that demonstrates the time - evolutions of the fidelity @xmath148 and the purity @xmath149 with several initial states .",
    "@xmath61     and the purity @xmath150 of the bipartite cavity state .",
    "the parameters are @xmath151 mhz and @xmath152 mhz .",
    "we take the initial gaussian states with mean zero and covariance matrices @xmath153 ( top line ) , @xmath154 ( middle ) , and @xmath155 ( bottom ) .",
    "note due to @xmath156 , the fidelity is now of the form @xmath157 .",
    "the entanglement achieved in this case is @xmath158 .",

    "the entanglement achieved in this case is @xmath158 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=211 ]",
    "in this section we first address a modification of the condition  ( ii ) of theorem  1 with different assumption , which is more suited to the concept of environment engineering .",
    "in fact , the result allows us to obtain a general procedure for synthesizing a dissipative system whose steady state is uniquely a desired pure gaussian state .",
    "we close this section with some examples .",
    "_ theorem 2 : _ let @xmath42 be a covariance matrix corresponding to a pure gaussian state .",
    "then , this is a unique steady state of the system if and only if @xmath159 where @xmath78 is defined in eq . .",
    "_ proof : _ we begin with the necessary part . in general , for a @xmath10-mode gaussian pure state , @xmath160 has a @xmath10-dimensional kernel @xcite , while now from the assumption eq",
    ". holds , implying @xmath161 .",
    "hence , showing @xmath162 completes the proof .",
    "now , as shown in the proof of theorem  1 , from the assumption we have @xmath163 , implying @xmath164 . on the other hand , the uniqueness of the steady state allows us to apply lemma  1 to get @xmath165 , thus @xmath166 . as a result",
    "we obtain @xmath162 .",
    "let us next move to the sufficiency part .",
    "first we show that @xmath42 satisfying eq .",
    "is a solution of eqs . and , thus that of eq .",
    "note that now eq .  ( [ th1 - 1 ] ) apparently holds . as seen from the last part of the proof of theorem  1 , eq .   implies @xmath167 , thus we need @xmath107 to derive eq . .",
    "to show this , assume there exists @xmath168 such that @xmath169",
    ". this leads to @xmath170 .",
    "now , from eq . with @xmath42 pure , we have @xmath163 and @xmath162 , thus @xmath171 = @xmath172 .",
    "then , as @xmath173 , we can write @xmath174 . this leads to @xmath175 = v_s\\sigma^\\top \\xi$ ] , thus contradiction to @xmath60 .",
    "consequently , we have @xmath176 .",
    "second , to complete the sufficiency part , we show that @xmath42 is unique , which is equivalent to that @xmath40 is hurwitz .",
    "suppose @xmath177 with @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",
    "multiplying eq .   by @xmath180 from the left and by @xmath181 from the right ,",
    "we obtain @xmath182 . note in general @xmath183 and @xmath60 .",
    "but now @xmath184 , because @xmath185 leads to @xmath186 and this is contradiction to @xmath187 . thus @xmath188 and this means that @xmath40 is hurwitz .",
    "the point of this result is that , while in theorem  1 the steady state is assumed to be unique , we here assume only that a given state is pure , without assuming its uniqueness . nonetheless , that state is guaranteed to be a unique steady state if the condition is satisfied .",
    "note again , as seen from the last part of the above proof , that the uniqueness is ensured by @xmath162 , which leads to the hurwitz property of the matrix @xmath40 .",
    "that is , we do not need to check whether @xmath40 is hurwitz .      based on the result shown above , we here provide a complete parameterization of the gaussian dissipative system that uniquely has a pure steady state .",
    "this then leads to an explicit procedure for engineering a desired gaussian dissipative system .",
    "we begin with the fact that any covariance matrix @xmath42 corresponding to a pure gaussian state has the following general representation @xcite : @xmath189 where @xmath190 and @xmath191 are @xmath17 real symmetric and real positive definite matrices ( i.e. , @xmath192 ) , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath63 is symplectic . with this representation",
    "we have @xmath193 where we defined @xmath194 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the symmetric matrix @xmath195 is useful in graphical calculus for several gaussian pure states .",
    "because @xmath196 is clearly of rank @xmath10 , we have @xmath197 hence , eq . is equivalent to @xmath198 to satisfy this condition , it is necessary that @xmath199 is included in @xmath200 and that @xmath200 is invariant under @xmath201 .",
    "these conditions are respectively represented by @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are @xmath205 and @xmath17 complex matrices . from the above equations , @xmath206 is represented by @xmath207 consequently , the necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath208 to be identical to @xmath200 is that there exist @xmath203 and @xmath204 satisfying eq . and",
    "the rank condition @xmath209 now let us write @xmath67 in the @xmath210 block matrix form @xmath211 , where @xmath212 and @xmath213 are real @xmath17 symmetric matrices and @xmath214 a real @xmath17 matrix .",
    "then the latter equation in eq . leads to @xmath215 the second equation is equivalent to that there exists a real skew symmetric matrix @xmath216 ( i.e. , @xmath217 ) satisfying @xmath218 .",
    "hence , by writing @xmath219 , we find that @xmath214 is expressed as @xmath220 . in this representation , @xmath204 is of the form @xmath221 . to conclude , we obtain the complete parameterization of @xmath114 and @xmath67 as follows :    @xmath222    again , @xmath203 ( complex ) , @xmath223 ( real symmetric ) , and @xmath216 ( real skew ) are the parameter matrices .",
    "we now have a reasonable procedure for environment engineering for pure gaussian state preparation ; that is , the procedure is simply to choose the matrices @xmath224 , and @xmath216 so that both the dissipative channels @xmath225 and the hamiltonian @xmath226 with the system matrices given in eq . have desired structures such as quasi - locality , while , at the same time , @xmath203 and @xmath221 satisfy the rank condition .    here",
    "we give some remarks .",
    "\\(i ) there always exists the pair of @xmath227 satisfying the rank condition eq .",
    ", if no restriction is imposed on those matrices ; this means that , for any pure gaussian state , there always exists a gaussian dissipative system for which that state is the unique steady state .",
    "\\(ii ) the most simple system may be such that @xmath203 is of rank @xmath10 . in this case",
    "we can set @xmath228 , implying that the system does not need a nontrivial hamiltonian but drives the state only by dissipation .",
    "this kind of system is called the _ purely dissipative system_. however , we are often in the situation where only @xmath229 dissipative channels can be implemented in reality , due to some reasons related to physical constraints . in this case , the matrix @xmath204 needs to be of rank at least @xmath230 , meaning that we must add a nontrivial hamiltonian .",
    "\\(iii ) as stated in @xcite , quasi - locality is indeed essential since otherwise it would be experimentally hard to realize such a dissipative system .",
    "it should be noticed that , because @xmath4 is quadratic , it can be always decomposed into the sum of quasi - local hamiltonians acting on at most two nodes , although those interactions between the nodes do not necessarily have the structure of a target entangled state ; in fact , it will be shown in example  5 that , to generate a chain - type cluster state , a hamiltonian having a ring - type interaction is added .",
    "that is , while in gaussian case the quasi - locality issue appears only in the part of dissipative channel , this does not mean that the complementary hamiltonian can readily be implemented .",
    "_ example 3 : general cv cluster and @xmath231-graph states_. menicucci et al . developed in @xcite a unified graphical calculus for all pure gaussian states in terms of the matrix @xmath194 .",
    "one of the important results is that the so - called canonical cv cluster state , which can be generated by first squeezing the momentum quadrature of all modes and then applying the controlled @xmath195 operations to the modes according to the graph of the cluster , can be generally represented by @xmath232 where @xmath190 corresponds to the symmetric adjacency matrix representing the graph structure of the cluster state and @xmath233 the squeezing parameter . for this state , for instance setting @xmath234 and @xmath235 in eq .",
    "gives a desired purely dissipative system with channels @xmath236 which have the same structure as that of the target cluster state .",
    "therefore , if each node of the graph is connected to at most three adjacency nodes , each dissipative channel acts on at most three modes too , i.e. , it is quasi - local .",
    "another important state discussed in @xcite is the @xmath231-graph state ; this state is generated by applying the unitary transformation @xmath237 with hamiltonian @xmath238 to the vacuum states @xmath239 , where @xmath240 is the real symmetric matrix representing the graph .",
    "note that @xmath241 is the sum of the two - mode squeezing hamiltonians .",
    "the corresponding covariance matrix is then given by eq . with @xmath242 and @xmath243 , hence @xmath244 where @xmath245 .",
    "unlike the cv cluster state representation , @xmath195 does not necessarily reflect the graph structure of the state .",
    "however , for instance when @xmath246 is self - inverse , i.e. , @xmath247 , we have @xmath248 .",
    "thus , in this case choosing @xmath234 gives a desired purely dissipative system acting on the nodes in the same manner as the hamiltonian .",
    "_ example 4 : two - mode squeezed state_. in the gaussian formulation we are often interested in the two - mode squeezed state , as it approximates the so - called epr state .",
    "this is represented as a @xmath231-graph state with the hamiltonian given by @xmath249 then the system matrices are @xmath242 and @xmath250 the corresponding covariance matrix is given by @xmath251    let us begin with constructing a purely dissipative system whose unique steady state is the above two - mode squeezed state ; in this case , we only need to specify a @xmath210 full - rank matrix @xmath203 to satisfy the rank condition .",
    "in particular , let us here choose @xmath252 which is clearly of full rank .",
    "then , @xmath253 is given by @xmath254 where @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "as a result , the master equation describing this purely dissipative process is given by @xmath257 where @xmath258 and @xmath259 . a possible physical realization of this system in a pair of atomic ensembles was discussed in @xcite .",
    "next let us discuss the case where we are allowed to implement only one dissipative channel .",
    "as an example we take @xmath260 , which corresponds to the first column vector of eq . .",
    "this yields @xmath261 in eq .",
    ", thus the dissipative channel is @xmath258 .",
    "we now need to specify a valid @xmath204 to satisfy the rank condition ; in particular let us take a specific hamiltonian matrix @xmath67 in eq . with @xmath262 and @xmath263 , then this leads to @xmath264 it is easily verified that @xmath265 is of full rank , hence the requirement is satisfied . in this case",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath226 is given by @xmath266 this hamiltonian and the dissipative channel @xmath267 construct the desired dissipative system .",
    "_ example 5 : 1-dimensional harmonic chain_. as a typical cluster state let us take a 1-dimensional ( equally weighted ) harmonic chain , particularly in the case of four - mode cluster just for simplicity . within the formalism of the canonical cv cluster state generation , the adjacency matrix @xmath190 and the graph matrix",
    "are respectively given by @xmath268 a desired purely dissipative system is readily obtained by taking @xmath269 in eq . , i.e. , @xmath270 ; this means that the four dissipative channels are given by @xmath271 each channel acts on at most three nodes , thus they are quasi - local ; fig .",
    "2 ( a ) depicts the structure of this environment - system interaction .",
    "note from the above discussion that the general 1-dimensional harmonic chain can also be generated by purely dissipative process with their channels acting on at most three nodes .",
    "the finite dimensional counterpart to this result is found in @xcite .",
    "now we have a natural question ; can the chain state be generated by a quasi - local dissipative process acting on at most _ two _ adjacency nodes ?",
    "if this is true , this means that engineering the dissipative environment becomes easier , apart from that we clearly need an additional hamiltonian .",
    "again let us consider the case of four - mode chain and take @xmath272 , implying that the system has one dissipative channel @xmath273 in eq . .",
    "note this acts on only two nodes . to determine the hamiltonian we have some freedom , but let us take in eq .",
    "@xmath274 this leads to @xmath275 , and it is readily verified that @xmath276 is of full rank .",
    "hence , we obtain the positive answer to the question raised above .",
    "the matrix @xmath67 is now of the form @xmath277 the first @xmath278 block matrix indicates that the hamiltonian @xmath226 has a ring - type structure where the 1 - 2 , 2 - 3 , 3 - 4 , and 4 - 1 nodes are connected with each other ; see the remark ( iii ) in the previous subsection .",
    "therefore it is concluded that the four - mode harmonic chain state can be generated by the dissipative process where both the dissipative channel and the hamiltonian quasi - locally act on only two adjacency nodes ; the structure of these interactions is shown in fig . 2 ( b ) .",
    "implementation of this system should be easier than that of the purely dissipative system obtained above , which acts on the nodes through the channels . @xmath61",
    "in this paper , we have derived the general necessary and sufficient conditions for a gaussian dissipative system to have a unique pure steady state . in particular , we have provided a complete parameterization of the gaussian dissipative system satisfying the requirement ; this leads to an explicit procedure for engineering a gaussian dissipative system whose steady state is uniquely a desired pure state .",
    "an important open question is how to construct , in a general framework , a practical dissipative system satisfying a quasi - locality constraint .",
    "although example  5 demonstrated the feasibility in engineering such a quasi - local dissipative system , that construction method is a heuristic one .",
    "note that in the finite - dimensional case the same problem remains open @xcite .",
    "we can take two approaches to dealing with the problem .",
    "the first one is suggested by the recent work by ticozzi and viola @xcite that , in the finite - dimensional case , characterizes a pure state generated by a dissipative system having a fixed quasi - locality constraint ; it was then shown that , based on this result , by switching dissipative channels through output feedback control @xcite , we are enabled to construct a desired quasi - local dissipative system .",
    "it is expected that this idea works in our case as well . actually , it was shown in @xcite that , with the use of a similar switching method , some gaussian cluster states can be generated in four - mode atomic ensembles trapped in a ring cavity .",
    "the other approach uses the schematic of quantum state transfer .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "first , an @xmath10-mode target ( entangled ) gaussian state of light fields is produced , and then , those fields are independently coupled to @xmath10 identical bosonic systems in a dissipative way ; then , as a result , that state is deterministically transferred to the systems . in this scheme ,",
    "we need the strong assumption that all the nodes are accessible and independently couple to the fields , but the interactions between the systems and the environment channels are all _",
    "local_. hence , from the fact that a number of pure gaussian cluster state of light fields can be produced efficiently with the use of some beam splitters and opos @xcite , this state - transfer - based approach is expected to be more reasonable .",
    "in fact , the dissipation - induced states shown in @xcite are generated using this technique .",
    "furthermore , one of the authors recently has developed a general theory of this scheme in terms of a quantum stochastic differential equation @xcite ."
