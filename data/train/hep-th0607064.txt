    "in two dimensional spacetime , bosonization enables the identification of fermions with finite energy solitons of a dual sine - gordon model @xcite .",
    "these solitons are topological objects that interpolate between two different vacua @xmath1 and @xmath2 ; for the antisoliton the behavior is similar , just interchanging the vacua . many important consequences can be easily derived in the dual scenario . in particular , when a fermion interaction coming from the minimal coupling with a maxwell term is introduced ( schwinger model ) @xcite , a mass term @xmath3 is induced in the dual theory . as a consequence ,",
    "a configuration with nonzero topological charge ( it tends to a nonzero value either at @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) can not have finite energy .",
    "in other words , a single soliton , or in fermionic language the single fermion , disappear from the space of asymptotic states .",
    "this can be understood as due to the confining nature of the maxwell interaction in two dimensions , which implies a linear potential between charges .",
    "a natural question that arises is whether a possible destabilization of the fermionic spectrum in higher dimensional systems can be studied in a similar manner . in reference @xcite ,",
    "fermions in three dimensions have been associated with vortex configurations of the dual bosonized gauge theory .",
    "then , the above mentioned program can be rephrased in terms of possible instabilities of the vortex modes as a consequence of interactions .",
    "as we will see , in the three dimensional case , interactions do not render in general the vortex energy infrared divergent , and it is harder to display scenarios where the destabilization of the vortices is observed .",
    "this situation is expected as we know that while in two dimensions the fermion spectrum is easily destabilized by interactions , in three or more dimensions , the quasiparticle picture is quite robust .",
    "then , we will search for possible destabilizations associated with the localization properties of the dual model .",
    "this aim can be understood in the following manner .",
    "the association of vortices in the bosonized theory and fermion states has been accomplished by using a path integral definition of the vortex propagator , by creating and annihilating the vortex at the position of an instanton anti - instanton pair in euclidean spacetime @xcite .",
    "these euclidean objects can be seen as a monopole anti - monopole pair joined by a dirac string which becomes observable . when the theory presents a well defined localization length , as in the case of free fermions , the dirac string can be seen as the vortex worldline and at large distances the induced action is dominated by the length of the string plus polyakov s action for spin one half particles .",
    "this leads to a pole in the vortex propagator , associated with the single fermion state .",
    "therefore , a possible breakdown of the above mentioned large distance behavior , induced by the fermion interactions , could eliminate the single fermion from the asymptotic space of states .",
    "we will show that , although the part of the induced action proportional to the string length is robust , there is a set of interactions that could destabilize the spin part .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ model ] we describe a general model of fermions coupled to @xmath6 gauge fields and discuss the dual theory in @xmath7 and @xmath0 , emphasizing the role of topological excitations . in section  [ analisis ]",
    "we analyze possible destabilizations of the fermion propagator due to interactions . finally , in section  [ discusion ] we discuss our results .",
    "let us consider massive fermions coupled with a gauge field , @xmath8+\\int d^\\nu x\\ , [ { \\mathcal a}\\ , j^{f}+\\frac{1}{4}{\\mathcal f}_{\\mu \\nu } \\hat{{\\mathcal p}}{\\mathcal f}_{\\mu \\nu}]\\ ; , \\label{modelo}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the action for free fermions , @xmath10 is the field strength tensor for a gauge field , and we have included a possible nonlocal operator @xmath11 , associated with a kernel @xmath12 , @xmath13 ( x)=\\int d^{\\nu}y\\ , { \\mathcal p}(x - y ) { \\mathcal f}(y)\\;.\\ ] ] we also define the fourier transform , @xmath14 the usual maxwell term is recovered by taking @xmath15 , that is , @xmath16 .    the integration over the gauge fields yields for the total fermion action , @xmath8+i[j^{f } ] \\makebox[.5 in ] { , } i[j^{f}]=\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^\\nu x\\ , j^{f}\\frac{1}{(-\\partial^2)\\hat{{\\mathcal p}}}\\ ; j^{f}\\ ; , \\label{kf}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the spacetime dimension .      in the simple case of massive fermions in @xmath18d , the model in eq.([kf ] ) can be bosonized according to @xcite , @xmath8+i[j^{f } ] \\leftrightarrow k_b[\\phi]+ i[\\epsilon \\partial \\phi]\\ ; , \\label{bos1d}\\ ] ] @xmath19=\\int d^2x\\ , \\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_\\mu \\phi \\partial^\\mu \\phi -\\mu \\cos \\beta \\phi\\right ] \\makebox[.5 in ] { , } i[\\epsilon \\partial \\phi]=\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^2x\\ , \\phi \\frac{1}{\\hat{{\\cal p } } } \\phi\\ ; , \\label{mass}\\ ] ] where we have used the bosonization rule for the fermion current @xmath20 , or in components , @xmath21 .",
    "when the interaction induced by the gauge fields is absent , the model contains the well known solitons representing the fermions in the bosonized language .",
    "these solitons are well localized finite energy solutions with nonzero topological charge . when @xmath15 , the mass term in eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) implies that configurations with nonzero topological charge can not have finite energy , as they are different from zero either at spatial @xmath4 or @xmath5 . in other words ,",
    "the maxwell interaction in @xmath18d eliminates the single soliton modes .",
    "this can be understood as in this case the fermions experience a linear interaction .",
    "an interesting question arises if we consider a general lorentz invariant kernel @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) .",
    "is there any situation in which the generally nonlocal @xmath3 term could allow for finite energy solutions in the infrared regime ? for this aim , we can consider a static field , @xmath23 with nonzero topological charge , thus satisfying , @xmath24 this means @xmath25 , for @xmath26 . on the other hand , using the fourier transformed variables , the nonlocal @xmath3 term reads , @xmath27 therefore , considering the class of operators having @xmath28 the energy of a nonzero topological configuration will be infrared finite whenever @xmath29 .",
    "the static potential @xmath30 associated with this nonlocal operator , @xmath31 corresponds to @xmath32 .",
    "then , the above mentioned energy is infrared finite whenever the nonlocal character of the maxwell term drives the static potential into a nonconfining one .",
    "let us consider a similar situation in @xmath0 , where it is also well established that the correlation functions of @xmath6 fermionic currents correspond to correlation functions of topological currents in the dual bosonized theory @xcite .",
    "this feature has a universal character , generalizing eq .",
    "( [ bos1d ] ) . in other words , we have the following formula @xcite , @xmath8+i[j^{f}]\\leftrightarrow k_{b}[\\lambda ] + i[\\varepsilon \\partial \\lambda ]   \\label{univ}\\ ] ] where , @xmath33 is the corresponding bosonized action and the bosonizing field @xmath34 is a scalar field @xmath35 in @xmath7 , and a gauge field @xmath36 in @xmath0 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath37 has to be read as @xmath38 or @xmath39 , respectively .",

    "following t hooft procedure @xcite , the vortex propagator in euclidean spacetime is obtained by path integrating over configurations where a vortex excitation is created out of the vacuum at a space - time point @xmath45 and after an intermediate propagation is annihilated at @xmath46 . before @xmath47 and after @xmath46",
    "the topological charge vanishes , while it is nonvanishing in between due to the existence of the vortex . therefore , suitable instanton anti - instanton singularities have to be introduced at @xmath47 and @xmath46 in order to match these inequivalent topological configurations . in the present three dimensional case these singularities can be seen as a monopole anti - monopole pair @xcite for the dual field strength @xmath48 , located at @xmath47 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "this pair is associated with a dirac string @xmath50 running from @xmath47 to @xmath46 , which becomes observable in the mcs model .",

    "now , when interactions are turned on , we will first search for possible infrared divergences of the vortex energy , similar to those occurring in the single soliton sector in the @xmath7 case .",
    "the vortex energy can be read from eq .",
    "( [ jj ] ) as the action per unit length for a straight string running along the euclidean time direction , @xmath62 where the quantities in boldface correspond to the two - dimensional projection @xmath63 .",
    "let us consider the class of interactions defined by eq .",
    "( [ alfa ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that now , in the @xmath0 case , there is no @xmath64 that can render the integral in eq .",
    "( [ ener ] ) infrared divergent .",
    "this is clear if @xmath65 is such that @xmath66 tends to zero or a finite constant , when @xmath67 . in the case where @xmath66 diverges faster than @xmath68 ,",
    "the infrared behavior of the integrand is proportional to @xmath69 , which is infrared integrable in two dimensional momentum space .",
    "finally , when @xmath66 diverges like @xmath68 or slower , the integrand is proportional to @xmath66 , which is also integrable .",
    "then , in @xmath0 , there is no energy instability of the vortices .",
    "this is understandable as in @xmath0 the quasiparticle picture is quite robust .",
    "the next step is to study a possible destabilization in the localization properties of the theory .",
    "interactions could induce a breakdown of the large distance behavior in eq .",
    "( [ n - r ] ) ; in this case , the derivation of a propagator which at large distances behaves as the free fermion propagator is not guaranteed .",
    "if this happens , instead of a dressed propagator for spin one half quasiparticles , we could be led to a different phase where the fermion spectrum is destabilized .    for this aim",
    ", we will study the effect of interactions , defined by eq .",
    "( [ modelo ] ) , on the induced string action in eq .",
    "( [ jj ] ) , with @xmath70 given in eq .",

    "the potential decay is slower than the coulomb potential ; @xmath75 corresponds to a logarithmic potential , @xmath76 gives a linear confining potential , etc .",
    "equation ( [ jj ] ) can also be written in terms of the associated kernels , for instance , the integral in the second term can be written as , @xmath77 @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a parametrization of @xmath50 and we have used that the theory is rotationally invariant as the nonlocal operators depend on @xmath80 .",

    "( [ kernel ] ) by the first term in eq .",

    "( [ fig1 ] ) we plot the kernel as a function of @xmath93 for @xmath76 and @xmath94 .",
    "this kernel turns out to be almost undistinguishable from the one obtained in the free fermion model , where @xmath95 and the kernel is of yukawa type with a localization length of the order of @xmath96 .",
    "we have also verified that the kernel localization exists over the whole interval of @xmath64 s , in spite of the fact that the associated potentials are in general long ranged .",
    "therefore , the term proportional to the string length in the large distance induced string action @xmath97 in eq .",
    "( [ n - r ] ) is never destabilized .",
    "finally , let us look for a possible destabilization of the spin one half term .",
    "firstly , we note that for free fermions the third term in eq .",
    "( [ jj ] ) is irrelevant at large distances , when compared with the first spin one half term .",
    "however , if the interaction is such that @xmath98 is nonzero at @xmath99 , the coefficient for the spin one half action will be changed at large distances and the free fermion propagator could be destabilized . according to eqs .",
    "( [ alfa ] ) and ( [ valoro ] ) , this happens when the associated potential is @xmath100 , @xmath101 , ranging from a coulomb up to confining behaviors .",
    "= 10 cm = 8 cm",
    "in this paper we have compared the effect of interactions on the asymptotic fermion spectrum in @xmath7 and @xmath0 . for this aim ,",
    "we have used the identification of the fermionic excitations with finite energy topological configurations in the dual bosonized theory .    as is well known , in the case of @xmath7 massive fermions , interactions associated with linear potentials destabilize the asymptotic fermionic states in the sense that the energy of a soliton configuration in the dual theory becomes infrared divergent , thus decoupling from the spectrum .",
    "this also occurs for any interaction leading to confining interparticle potentials .    on the other hand ,",
    "we have shown that in @xmath0 the vortex energy is always infrared finite .",
    "this is another way of understanding that the free fermionic asymptotic spectrum in higher dimensions is quite robust .",
    "however , we have seen that an interesting effect of interactions on the spin degrees of the model takes place .",
    "this comes about from the representation of the fermion propagator as a vortex correlator in the dual theory .",
    "we have verified that for interactions associated with potentials @xmath100 , @xmath101 , there is a term in the induced action for the vortex worldline that competes with the spin one half polyakov term at large distances .",
    "these potentials range from a coulomb up to confining behaviors ( @xmath76 corresponds to a linear interparticle potential )",
