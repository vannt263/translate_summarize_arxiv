    "massive gas clouds in the ism are considered to be the progenitors of young stars in the conventional picture of star formation in galaxy disks .",
    "the gas may initially be either in an atomic or in a molecular state @xcite depending on the ambient physical conditions ( uv flux and gas pressure ) , but as the volume densities increase through self - gravity , the gas becomes mostly molecular on its way to forming stars .",
    "once the gas is molecular and at densities above @xmath5 , the cooling rate is so high ( e.g.  @xcite ) that rapid collapse follows .",
    "the rate - determining step in the conventional picture is then the aggregation of  or diffuse @xmath4and the formation of giant molecular clouds .",
    "@xcite has discussed this problem in detail .    for many late - type systems",
    ", the rate - determining step along the path to star formation appears to be the conversion of  clouds into @xmath4 .",
    "the fraction of the ism in atomic form is thought to increase as one progresses along the hubble sequence towards the late - type galaxies ( see e.g.  the review by @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the atomic fraction is thought to dominate the molecular by an order of magnitude or more for a significant number of actively - star - forming galaxies of types sc and later @xcite .",
    "however , in recent years evidence has been accumulating that a significant fraction of the  in the ism of galaxies is in fact not a precursor to the star formation process , but instead is produced by photodissociation of the @xmath4  by uv photons emanating from nearby newly - formed massive stars . in that case , either the way we compute the molecular fraction in galaxies via the co(1 - 0 ) emission is wrong , or our ideas of how to control the otherwise runaway collapse of molecular clouds to form stars need further modification .",
    "@xcite has summarized the view that magnetic fields may be a controlling factor in cloud collapse .",
    "the dissociation process was first described by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4  absorbs photons emitted at 1108   and 1008 via electronic transitions in the lyman ( @xmath6 ) and werner ( @xmath7 ) bands . in the subsequent decay to the vibrationally excited levels of the ground electronic state , @xmath8% of the @xmath4  molecules will dissociate .",
    "photons with wavelengths as long as @xmath9 can continue to create  by dissociating the `` pumped '' ( @xmath10 ) @xmath4  via additional lyman and werner band transitions .",
    "the uv fluorescence spectrum predicted from this process was first observed by @xcite in the nebula ic  63 .    the initial evidence that  may be a _ product _ of the star formation process rather than a precursor to it was discovered in a comparison of the morphology of dust lanes and  ridges in a prominent spiral arm of the galaxy m83 ( ngc 5236 ) by @xcite .",
    "this comparison showed that the ridges defining the  spiral arms peaked not on the dust lanes , as would have been expected in the conventional picture of density - wave - triggered star formation @xcite , but instead they were co - linear with the chain of  regions created by young massive stars forming _ downstream _ from the dust lane .",
    "other studies followed on m83 and other nearby spiral galaxies and have generally reached the same conclusions : for m83 @xcite , for m51 @xcite , and for m100 @xcite .",
    "infrared data are providing important support for this picture .",
    "for instance , models constrained by kao measurements of the @xmath11 m ]  line indicate that photodissociation may produce as much as 70%80% of the  in the disk of ngc  6946 @xcite .",
    "more recently , spectra of nearby galaxies taken with the iso satellite indicate that the bulk of the mid - infrared emission from galaxy disks arises in photodissociation regions ( pdrs ) @xcite .",
    "photodissociation therefore appears to be an important , and in some cases perhaps even the dominant , factor in defining the appearance and distribution of  in galaxies , at least over the main body of their stellar disks . in the pdr picture ,  is produced on the surfaces of molecular clouds by the action of far - uv photons from nearby o and b ( and some a ) stars .",
    "the physics of pdrs has been worked out in detail ( see e.g.  the review by @xcite ) , partly in response to new observational results on the infrared spectra of nearby galactic star - forming regions such as orion .",
    "recognition of the layered structure of the different atomic and molecular species which exist in dense , bright pdrs like the orion bar ( @xmath12 , @xcite ) requires linear resolution better than @xmath13 pc , and the  layer in this case would be only @xmath14 pc thick .",
    "however , pdrs are also formed by modest uv fluxes incident on low - density clouds , and the  layers in this case are much thicker .",
    "for example , @xcite have identified a large , low - density pdr in the galaxy , near the molecular cloud g216 - 2.5 . in this case , the  layer is probably 10 - 50 pc thick ( @xmath15 ) , and appears in projection as an object about @xmath16 pc in size .",
    "while the ir emission from such large , low - density pdrs is hard to detect ( but see @xcite ) , the  emission is actually easier to measure , since the pdr is larger and therefore covers a larger fraction of the radio telescope beam at @xmath1721 cm .",
    "the problem with such measurements in the galaxy which williams and maddelena had to circumvent is the confusion of the  profiles by unrelated gas along the same line of sight .",
    "synthesis imaging radio telescopes can now offer linear resolutions of order 100200 pc in the nearby galaxies , and the confusion problem can be minimized by choosing galaxies which are viewed more face - on .",
    "the combination of high spatial resolution ( @xmath18 pc ) mapping along with far ultraviolet ( fuv ) and h@xmath19 imagery provides a unique opportunity to explore the details of the photodissociation picture in external galaxies .",
    "fuv imagery at @xmath20   ( @xmath21 ev ) directly measures the lower energy photons which can dissociate `` pumped '' molecular gas , and serves as a tracer for the more energetic photons in the range @xmath22   which start the pumping process for ground - state @xmath4 .",
    "h@xmath19 imagery is used to assess the importance of extinction , which may be substantial in the far ultraviolet .",
    "@xcite , hereafter a97 , have used this technique with the sb(r)i - ii galaxy m81 , finding that patches of  emission are often located at the periphery of star forming regions mapped in the fuv , as expected for pdrs .",
    "the  column densities in m81 are consistent with the photodissociation of a low density molecular gas by relatively modest uv fluxes .    in this paper , we extend the work of a97 to the sc(s)i galaxy m101 and carry out a much more extensive and quantitative analysis of the data .",
    "owing to its proximity ( 7.4 mpc , @xcite ) , its nearly face  on orientation , and the availability of fuv , h@xmath19 , and  data , m101 is the next obvious candidate for this type of work .",
    "the best angular resolution presently available in  for m101 is @xmath23 ; this corresponds to @xmath24  pc , just adequate to permit identification of the larger pdrs , but still not sufficient to provide much morphological detail .",
    "the m101 data are discussed in  [ sec : data ] ; they have all been drawn from existing archival data sets .",
    "a representative sample of pdrs is identified and discussed in  [ sec : results ] .",
    "the volume density of the gas , @xmath25 , associated with each pdr is derived in  [ sec : volume ] .",
    "the implications of the resulting radial profile of @xmath25 are discussed in  [ sec : imp ] .",
    "the method used in this paper provides a new probe for studying the molecular gas content of galaxies which can be compared with the conventional results obtained from using the co molecular emission ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "questions have been raised about the reliability of co as a tracer for molecular hydrogen in galaxy disks ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) , and it is of interest to explore other ways of establishing the amount and physical state of the ism in different parts of galaxies .",
    "the fuv image of m101 was obtained by the ultraviolet imaging telescope ( uit ) @xcite during the astro-2 mission with the b1 filter ( @xmath26  , @xmath27  ) and an exposure time of 1310 s. the spatial resolution and pixel spacing of the image are @xmath28 fwhm and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "astrometric and photometric uncertainties are @xmath30 and @xmath31% , respectively .",
    "an image of the h@xmath19 emission with resolution @xmath32 fwhm was obtained from l.  van zee and m.  haynes .",
    "the vla 21 cm line data were provided by r.  braun . the spatial resolution is @xmath33 fwhm ( 215 pc ) , and the pixel spacing is @xmath34 ( 72 pc ) .",
    "the velocity channels are separated by 5.16 km s@xmath35 and the velocity resolution is 6.2 km s@xmath35 .",
    "we re - derived a map of the  column density , @xmath36 ( ) , by using the pixels in the channel maps whose values exceed 3 times the @xmath37 noise value of 16.8 k. the radial profile of the  column density derived from our data agrees with the original data portrayed in figure 8a of @xcite .",
    "full - size images of the fuv , h@xmath19 , and  emission from m101 can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the original astrometry of the fuv and h@xmath19 images appears to be excellent based upon the general agreement in the positions of fuv peaks and h@xmath19 sources , and in the large  scale spatial distribution of the fuv continuum and the h@xmath19 and 21  cm line emission .",
    "the astrometry of the  images is intrinsically @xmath38 , owing to the calibration procedures used at the vla .",
    "the fuv and h@xmath19 images are then smoothed and resampled to match the spatial resolution and pixel spacing of the  data .",
    "the relationship between the fuv , h@xmath19 , and  emission is illustrated in figures [ fig : overlay1 ] and [ fig : overlay2 ] .",
    "boxes indicate the locations of regions shown in more detail in figures [ fig : fuvha2 ] through [ fig : fuvhi3 ] .",
    "these regions are chosen arbitrarily to provide examples of the detailed fuv , h@xmath19 , and  morphology .",
    "a large  scale spatial correspondence between the 21 cm line emission and the fuv and h@xmath19 emission is observed , as expected in both the conventional and photodissociation pictures .",
    "star formation occurs where `` sufficient amounts '' of gas have accumulated in the conventional picture .",
    "however , that picture does not yet provide a _ quantitative _ connection between e.g. the amount of precursor gas ( both atomic and molecular ) which is present and the number of young stars formed from it . determining this relation from the observations is currently an active area of research in the study of star formation in galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "on the other hand , the photodissociation picture provides a direct , quantitative connection between the fuv flux emanating from a region of recent star formation , the volume density of the @xmath4 , and the column density of the surrounding .",
    "we have chosen in what follows to interpret our results in terms of the photodissociation picture .",
    "while we clearly favor such an approach , we must emphasize that our data , by themselves , do not provide a definitive argument against the conventional picture .",
    "extinction effects are much stronger at 1500   than in the visual , as indicated by reddening curves for the milky way ( e.g.  @xmath39 @xcite ) and the small magellanic cloud ( e.g.  @xmath40 @xcite ) .",
    "this fact raises the concern that ultraviolet  based studies may be biased if entire star forming regions are totally obscured at fuv wavelengths . for this reason , a97 explore the effects of extinction in m81 by comparing the fuv and h@xmath19 emission .",
    "these authors find a strong correspondence between the small  scale structure of the fuv and h@xmath19 emission in m81 , with every bright , reliable h@xmath19 source having a fuv counterpart .",
    "this suggests that the fuv morphology is relatively unaffected by extinction , or at least that the fuv and the h@xmath19 are affected in the same way .    to explore the importance of extinction in m101",
    ", we examined a set of non ",
    "stellar h@xmath19 sources for fuv counterparts .",
    "we selected objects with the simple goal of constructing a set of representative sources distributed across the galaxy which could be examined interactively for fuv counterparts .",
    "the automated point source extraction routines found in gipsy and iraf are sufficient for this purpose , yielding @xmath41 h@xmath19 sources when using a peak intensity threshold of 15@xmath42 .",
    "the resulting set does not form a statistically complete sample .",
    "visual inspection of the data reveals that approximately 10% of the sources lack a detectable fuv counterpart within a radius of @xmath43 ( 360 pc ) , at the present sensitivity .",
    "a comparison with the h@xmath19 images of m101 presented in @xcite shows that these sources are in fact real regions , and not artifacts .",
    "examples of h@xmath19 sources without fuv counterparts may be seen in figure [ fig : fuvha2 ] ; these sources tend to be fainter h@xmath19 peaks .",
    "source coordinates are given in table [ tab : nofuv ] .",
    "sources such as those observed at ra = @xmath44 , dec@xmath45 , and at ra = @xmath46 , dec = @xmath47 are foreground stars , based upon the continuum and narrow  band imagery of @xcite .",
    "the existence of equally faint h@xmath19 sources with fuv counterparts indicates that the lack of fuv emission is more likely to be an extinction effect than a sensitivity issue .",
    "we conclude that fuv wavelengths effectively map the locations of the majority of the star forming regions in m101 , without _ severe _ extinction effects .",
    "( the amount of extinction will be discussed further in section [ sec : tau ] ) . in this case ,",
    "fuv mapping offers an additional advantage over h@xmath19 mapping in that fuv wavelengths will trace older sites of star formation in which ionizing stars are no longer present .",
    "such fuv  bright / h@xmath19dim sites are powered primarily by b stars , whose photon energies are still favorable for the dissociation of @xmath4 .",
    "a97 find that 10% of 144 fuv sources in m81 do not exhibit h@xmath19 emission .",
    "we identified @xmath48 fuv sources distributed across m101 , using a threshold peak intensity of @xmath49 .",
    "of these , the brightest 177 ( half of the sources ) were visually examined for the presence of h@xmath19 counterparts .",
    "approximately 7% of the 177 sources do not appear to have an h@xmath19 counterpart within @xmath43 ( 360 pc ) , at the present sensitivity .",

    "we focus our attention on a smaller sample of approximately 100 fuv sources .",
    "the selection criteria were driven by our desire to identify a set of representative sources distributed across m101 , manageable in size .",
    "the resulting sample is not intended to be statistically complete .",
    "the sample contains all fuv sources with peak intensities @xmath56 identified by the point source extraction routines .",
    "these sources comprise 2/3 of the set .",
    "the remaining sources were chosen by eye to bring the total number of sources to @xmath57 , while keeping the distribution uniform across the galaxy .",
    "this technique ensures that we do not exclude sources that may have been missed by the point source extractors .",
    "the added sources have peak intensities of @xmath58 .",
    "all but one ( a weak elongated source ) belong to the set of 350 sources discussed above .",
    "the properties of the h@xmath19 and emission are not considered during the source selection .",
    "the small  scale relationship between the fuv and the  emission is shown in figures [ fig : fuvhi2 ] and [ fig : fuvhi3 ] .",
    "the general distribution of the  gas follows that of the diffuse fuv emission , with enhancements in the 21 cm line emission seen near fuv peaks , as in m81 .",
    "all but 2 of the @xmath57 fuv sources exhibit 21 cm line emission within 800 pc of the source .",
    "specific regions of interest in m101 include the area surrounding sn  1951 , located at ra(1950 ) = @xmath59 , dec(1950 ) = @xmath60 , at the inner edge of the prominent eastern spiral arm . here ,",
    "fuv emission is coincident with and extends from the site of the ngc  5462  region ( ra(1950 ) = @xmath61 , dec(1950 ) = @xmath62 , our figure [ fig : fuvhi2 ] , see also figure 7 of @xcite ) .",
    "emission from the 21 cm line lies along the periphery of the region but is absent in the vicinity of sn1951 itself . within the framework of the photodissociation picture , an explanation for this morphology could be that this is a region of intense past and present star formation , as evidenced by the fuv , h@xmath19 and radio continuum emission .",
    "generations of supernovae prior to sn1951 may have evacuated much of the surrounding molecular gas , resulting in the apparent hole in the gas distribution . non  ionizing photons may have dissociated the skins of the remaining molecular gas clouds , creating the observed  which neatly curves around the existing fuv  emitting regions .",
    "a sketch of the spatial relationships between the fuv , h@xmath19 , and  emission in this type of situation may be found in case iv , figure 8 of a97 .",
    "a case in which the star forming regions may lie above the mid  plane of the galaxy is seen at ra = @xmath63 , dec = @xmath64 in figure [ fig : fuvhi2 ] . here , the ngc  5461 complex shows enhanced  emission slightly offset from the main fuv source , as well as spatially coincident .",
    "the ngc  5447 complex , with peaks at ra = @xmath65 dec@xmath66 and ra = @xmath67 and dec = @xmath68 , in figure [ fig : fuvhi3 ] is another example of this morphology , which occurs when  appears spread over the fuv - emitting region but without much associated extinction . the  in this case is behind the fuv source along the line of sight , as in case i , figure 8 of a97 .",
    "another interesting morphological behavior is exemplified by the small fuv  bright / h@xmath19dim source located in the  depression at ra = @xmath69 dec = @xmath70 , just north of ngc  5447 in figure [ fig : fuvhi3 ] .",
    "this site may represent an older star forming region which has blown a hole through the plane of the galaxy .",
    "non  ionizing photons from the remaining b stars could be dissociating the walls of the hole , producing the observed .",
    "this scenario corresponds to that illustrated in case iii , figure 8 of a97 .",
    "finally , we note that the large loop of  centered at approximately ra = @xmath71 , dec = @xmath72 in figure [ fig : fuvhi2 ] presents a case where some of the pdrs may be obscured .",
    "the northern portion of the loop shows the presence of fainter h@xmath19 sources and only weak fuv emission .",
    "the southern portion of the loop contains multiple , brighter fuv sources , however .",
    "some of these sources also appear to lack h@xmath19 counterparts , and may be older sites of star formation ( e.g.  the fuv peak located at ra = @xmath73 , dec = @xmath74 ) .",
    "this behavior could be explained if star forming regions in the northern portion of the loop lie closer to the mid  plane of the galaxy , in a behavior intermediate between cases i and ii in figure 8 of a97 .",
    "the northern sources may also be younger sites of star formation which have not had sufficient time to break through the ism .",
    "these types of sources are clearly in the minority , however ; the locations of the majority of candidate pdrs are effectively mapped by the fuv emission .",
    "we have used the uit data to select a group of candidate pdrs for further study . of the @xmath57 fuv",
    " bright sources , we identified 35 regions for which 1 ) the total fuv flux and 2 ) the distance between the fuv source and the peaks of the associated 21 cm line emission could be reliably measured .",
    "the selected sources are therefore relatively isolated and in areas containing detectable .",
    "the primary selection criterion is in fact confusion , as 95% of the rejections were based upon the presence of another significant fuv source within @xmath75 ( 540 pc ) .",
    "two sources were rejected due to a lack of 21 cm emission within a radius of @xmath76 ; one additional source was rejected due to the weakness of the emission .",
    "the locations of the 35 selected regions are shown in figure [ fig : fuv ] .",
    "the regions are classified into two subsets according to the intensity @xmath77 of the fuv flux seen by the neighboring  clouds . the  column density is directly related to @xmath77 in the photodissociation picture ( see section [ sec : physics ] ) .",
    "regions in figure [ fig : fuv ] marked with small square boxes are characterized by a narrow range of @xmath77 such that @xmath78 .",
    "these regions represent a set of `` standard uv fluxes . ''",
    "regions designated by open circles have fuv fluxes outside of this range .",
    "the fuv , h@xmath19 , and  morphologies of typical candidate pdrs are illustrated in figures [ fig : pdrfuvha ] through [ fig : pdra ] .",
    "the quantity @xmath77 is given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 ergs @xmath81 s@xmath35 @xmath35 is the solar neighborhood value at 1500   ( a97 , and references therein ) , @xmath82 is the total fuv flux observed by uit in @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the distance between the fuv source and the peak of the neighboring  emission in parsecs , and @xmath85 is the adopted distance to m101 ( in parsecs ) . the value of @xmath86 is based upon the values of the local interstellar radiation field given by @xcite and illustrated in figure 1 of @xcite .",
    "the solar neighborhood value varies weakly over the wavelength range of the uit b1 filter ; the adopted value of @xmath86 would change by less than 10% if we were to convolve the @xcite curve with the uit b1 filter profile .",
    "the measurements of @xmath84 and @xmath87 , the associated column density , are dependent upon the morphology of the source .",
    "as seen in figure [ fig : pdra ] , multiple patches of 21 cm emission neighbor each source . each patch serves as an equally valid probe of the surrounding ism .",
    "we determine @xmath84 by calculating the average  surface brightness in successive annuli for each pdr .",
    "the annuli are centered upon the fuv source .",
    "the quantity @xmath84 is defined as the radius at which the surface brightness profile first reaches a local maximum . to measure the associated column density , @xmath87 , we identify the brightest patch of 21 cm line emission located at a distance @xmath84 from the fuv source .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath87 corresponds to the brightest pixel within the patch .",
    "the distance between the brightest pixel and the fuv source is always within 0.5 pixels of @xmath84 .",
    "this measurement of @xmath87 is preferred to the average value of @xmath87 obtained from the surface brightness profiles since the annuli include regions lacking 21 cm line emission .",
    "the average values therefore underestimate the column densities in the local ism .",

    "filled circles represent the regions with @xmath78 .",
    "the values of the sky background and any surrounding diffuse fuv emission have been removed from the measurements of @xmath82 .",
    "this is accomplished by measuring the average fuv surface brightness in successive annuli centered on the fuv source .",
    "the amount of diffuse @xmath88 sky background per unit area is measured at the radius at which the fuv surface brightness levels off in the resulting radial profile .",
    "this value is subtracted from the total fuv flux contained within this radius .",

    "while the photodissociation scenario suggests that the  enhancements are associated with the fuv emission , we remind the reader that other interpretations of the data may be valid , and that the observed morphology may simply reflect the general distribution of  enhancements in m101 . the  enhancements for the remaining 3 sources are fairly distant from the fuv sources ( @xmath90 pc ) and may not be associated with the fuv source .",

    "these authors find that the central regions of m101 are characterized by higher optical depths than the outer regions , consistent with the general behavior of the dust  to  gas ratio .",
    "based upon the scatter plot of optical depths in figure 3 of scowen et al . , we adopt a radial profile of the optical depth of the form @xmath150 , where @xmath117 is the radius , for @xmath151 kpc , and @xmath152 for @xmath153 kpc .",
    "these values provide a lower limit to the required extinction corrections , as radio observations of regions in m101 indicate that optical depths derived from optical h@xmath19/h@xmath149 line ratios only trace a fraction of the total optical depth in those regions @xcite .",

    "these calculations use corrections based upon averaged extinction and dust  to  gas values ; the volume densities could be further constrained by obtaining data on the specific optical depths and dust  to  gas ratios of the specific 35 candidate pdrs in our study .",
    "figures [ fig : tau1 ] and [ fig : tau2 ] are our current best estimates for the radial dependence of the total gas volume density in m101 .",
    "this gas should be essentially all @xmath4 . in the process of correcting the `` raw '' values of volume density ( table [ tab : data ] ) for the radial variations of dust - to - gas fraction ( resulting in figures [ fig : volcorr ] and [ fig : volcorrb ] ) and",
    "uv extinction ( finally producing figures [ fig : tau1 ] and [ fig : tau2 ] ) , the radial variations have disappeared .",
    "the molecular gas shows a surprisingly narrow range of values from 30 - 1000 @xmath4molecules @xmath0 for the edmunds & pagel type metallicity gradient , with no clear trend from the inner  deficient regions near @xmath156 kpc , through the  rich `` main body '' of the galaxy near @xmath157 kpc , all the way out to the  poor outer parts at @xmath158 kpc .",
    "we note that the edmunds & pagel type metallicity gradient is a good representation for the mean of an ensemble of nearby galaxies @xcite , which leads us to favor figure [ fig : tau1 ] as the most likely final result .",
    "one concern is that the narrow range of values in figure [ fig : tau1 ] could result from observational selection .",
    "for example , regions of high volume density located near typical fuv sources may be missed since the  would have a relatively low column density and a low filling factor .",
    "this is not an issue for this study since only 3% of our initial sample of fuv sources were rejected due to a lack of 21 cm line emission . to confirm this statement , we examined an additional 10 distinct fuv sources .",
    "measurable  is found within 800 pc for all ten sources .",
    "this is consistent with the spatial correlation between fuv sources and 21 cm line emission observed in figures [ fig : overlay2 ] , [ fig : fuvhi2 ] , and [ fig : fuvhi3 ] .",
    "virtually all fuv sources are associated with 21 cm line emission , with the exception of the innermost regions of m101 , where the  column density is supressed due to the strong increase in the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "what kind of observational selection could operate on the low - density side of figure [ fig : tau1 ] ? according to equation [ eqn : nhi ] , @xmath4  with low volume density can produce large columns of  which may become optically thick , leading us by equation [ eqn : voldens ] to overestimate the @xmath4  density and thus depopulate the lower part of figure [ fig : tau1 ] . however , gas of density e.g.  @xmath159 @xmath0 with  columns in the optically - thick regime of n ( ) @xmath160 @xmath81 would be typically @xmath161 pc in size .",
    "examination of figure [ fig : overlay2 ] and the zoomed figures [ fig : fuvhi2 ] and [ fig : fuvhi3 ] shows that the highest - brightness  regions are unresolved , however .",
    "ngc  5447 in figure [ fig : fuvhi3 ] is a good example of this , as are ngc  5461 and ngc  5462 in figure [ fig : fuvhi2 ] .",
    "this means the path lengths are @xmath162 pc , which implies values of n ( ) @xmath163 @xmath81 in figure [ fig : nhichi ] , where optical depth in the  is not likely to be a problem .",
    "therefore , the paucity of points at low volume densities in figure [ fig : tau1 ] is very likely real .",
    "we conclude that the 35 regions studied do indeed comprise a representative sample of pdrs , and that observational selection is not likely to be the cause of the narrow range of values for @xmath25(@xmath4 ) in figure [ fig : tau1 ] .",
    "our results refer only to the ism in the immediate vicinities of young stars and clusters of young stars .",
    "we do not know from the present observations if the results are representative of the ism as a whole .",
    "furthermore , the measurement of the  emission does not immediately provide a total gas mass without additional assumptions about the geometry of the ism since the  emission is a surface phenomenon in the pdr picture .",
    "further discussion of the implications of our results for the ism content of galaxies in general is beyond the scope of this paper ; we hope to return to these questions in a future publication .",
    "@xcite have proposed an interpretation for the radial distribution of the bright  peaks in m101 and other nearby spirals in terms of variations in the hydrostatic pressure of the ism .",
    "their picture is insightful and deserves a more thorough discussion in the light of the present results than space here permits .",
    "uv photons clearly dominate the physics of the ism in the immediate neighborhoods of young stars .",
    "the production of  from @xmath4  by photodissociation is a natural and inevitable consequence of this physics .",
    "we have described how photodissociation can explain the geometrical structure of the  on scales of @xmath164 pc in nearby galaxies and have discussed how the physics of photodissociation can be used to provide a new probe of the density of the underlying molecular hydrogen .",
    "in addition , we have presented a straightforward explanation for the disappearance of  in the inner parts of galaxies .",
    "acceptance of this picture requires a shift in parts of the paradigm for star formation from the ism , from viewing  as a precursor , to seeing it as a _ product _ of the star formation process . while the present results do not by themselves",
    "demand discarding the old paradigm , they further strengthen the viability of the new one .",
