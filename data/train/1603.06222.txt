    "we are now in the age of big data  @xcite . an unprecedented era in history where the storing , managing and manipulation of information is no longer effective using previously used computational tools and techniques . to compensate for this , one important approach in manipulating such large data sets and extracting worthwhile inferences ,",
    "is by utilizing machine learning techniques .",
    "machine learning  @xcite involves using specially tailored ` learning algorithms ' to make important predictions in fields as varied as finance , business , fraud detection , and counter terrorism .",
    "tasks in machine learning can involve either supervised or unsupervised learning and can solve such problems as pattern and speech recognition , classification , and clustering .",
    "interestingly enough , the overwhelming rush of big data in the last decade has also been responsible for the recent advances in the closely related field of artificial intelligence  @xcite ; with the achievements of alphago being a remarkable milestone .",
    "another important field in information processing which has also seen a significant increase in interest in the last decade is that of quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "quantum computers are expected to be able to perform certain computations much faster than any classical computer .",
    "in fact , quantum algorithms have been developed which are exponentially faster than their classical counterparts  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new subfield within quantum information has emerged combining ideas from quantum computing with artificial intelligence to form quantum machine learning .",
    "such discrete - variable schemes have shown exponential speedup in learning algorithms , such as supervised and unsupervised learning  @xcite , support vector machine  @xcite , cluster assignment  @xcite and others  @xcite .",
    "initial proof - of - principle experimental demonstrations have also been performed  @xcite .    in this paper , we have developed learning algorithms based on a different , but equally important , type of substrate in quantum computing , those of continuous variables ( cvs )  @xcite .",
    "a cv system is characterized by having an infinite - dimensional hilbert space described by measuring variables with a continuous eigenspectra .",
    "the year 1999 saw the first important attempt at developing a cv model of quantum computing  @xcite .",
    "seven years later , the cluster state version  @xcite of cvs  @xcite , accelerated the field s interest due to experimental interest .",
    "the result of this were proof - of - principle demonstrations  @xcite , which culminated in an ` on - the - run ' one - million - node cluster  @xcite , as well as a 60-node ` simultaneous ' cluster  @xcite .",
    "further important theoretical work was also carried out  @xcite , including an important cv architecture that was finally fault tolerant  @xcite .    here , we take advantage of the practical benefits of cvs ( high - efficiency room - temperature detectors , broad bandwidths , large - scale entanglement generation , etc . ) by generalizing quantum machine learning to the infinite dimension .",
    "specifically , we develop the important cv tools and subroutines that form the basis of the exponential speedup in various machine learning algorithms .",
    "this includes matrix inversion , principle component analysis and vector distance .",
    "furthermore , each of these crucial subroutines are given a finite squeezing analysis for future experimental demonstrations along with a suggested photonic implementation .",

    "we assume the vector @xmath11 is normalised . obtaining the classical value of each data @xmath12",

    "nevertheless in some applications only the global behavior of the data set is interesting . for example , the value @xmath15 can be computed efficiently by a quantum computer with significantly fewer copies of @xmath14 @xcite . quantum machine",
    "learning algorithms take advantage of this property to reduce the amount of memory and operations needed .    if the data set @xmath11 is sufficiently uniform , it is known that @xmath14 can be efficiently generated . as an illustration",
    ", we outline in the supplementary section an explicit protocol to generate a state with @xmath16 coherent basis states , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "our protocol generalizes the discrete variable method in ref .",
    "@xcite to cv system by utilizing the cv implementation of the grover s operators , @xmath19 for any given @xmath20 , as well as the efficient generation of cat states and coherent states @xcite .",
    "the encoding state construction of general non - uniform data could be constructed by extending the discrete - variable quantum ram ( qram )  @xcite to a cv system , or by using a hybrid scheme  @xcite , although the state generation efficiency of such a general encoded state remains an open question @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the versatility of cv machine learning is not limited to process classical data sets that involve a discrete number of data . in the context of universal cv quantum computation ,",
    "the output of a computer is a cv state that evolves under an engineered hamiltonian @xcite ; the wave function of such a full cv output can not be expressed in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq1psi ] ) .",
    "as we will see , the cv machine learning subroutines are capable of processing even full cv states , and they are thus more powerful than the discrete variable counterparts  @xcite .    _ exponential swap gate  _ in both the data state construction and the quantum machine learning operation , the generalized grover s operator , @xmath21 , plays the main role of inducing a phase shift according to an ensemble of unknown given states @xmath22 . as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , such an operation can be implemented by repeatedly applying the exponential swap operation and tracing out the auxiliary mode , i.e. , [ eq : erho ] _  ( e^it ",

    "we outline the procedure of implementing the exponential operator with standard cv techniques .",
    "first of all , we need a qubit as control , which can be implemented by two auxiliary modes , 1 and 2 , with one and only one photon in both modes , i.e. , the state of the modes is @xmath24 .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath25 is controllable by applying the rotation operator @xmath26 , which can be implemented by linear optics  @xcite .",

    "the operations in @xmath29 can be implemented with the quartic gate introduced in @xcite .",
    "see appendix b for more detail .",
    "the control qubit is first prepared in @xmath30 . by applying the operations in sequence @xmath31 ,",
    "the state becomes [ eq : eswap ] & & c^c c_r()c^c c_|+|_c |_c = |+e^i_cc    & & |+(|_c |_c + i |_c |_c )  .",
    "the method can be generalized to implement a multi - mode exponential swap , @xmath32 , by applying @xmath33 .",
    "we note that the precious resources of a single photon state is not measured or discarded , so it can be reused in future operations .",
    "we emphasize that , in stark contrast to the proposed implementation of exponential - swap gate in @xcite which is _ logical _ and thus composed by a series of discrete variable logic gates , our implementation of the exponential - swap gate is _ physical _ ,",
    "i.e. , it can be applied to full cv states that could not be written as the discrete variable form in eq .",
    "( [ eq1psi ] ) .",
    "this property allows our subroutine to be applied in , e.g. quantum tomography of cv states , which is more complicated than the discrete variable counterparts due to the large degree of freedom .",
    "now we discuss several key subroutines ( matrix inversion , principle component analysis , and vector distance ) that power the quantum machine learning problems using the tools we have just introduced .",
    "_ matrix inversion  _",
    "various machine learning applications involves high - dimensional linear equations , e.g. , @xmath34 .",
    "the advantage of some quantum machine learning algorithms is the ability to solve linear equations efficiently .",
    "specifically , for any vector @xmath35 , computing the solution vector @xmath36 is more efficient on a quantum computer  @xcite .    in a cv system ,",
    "the algorithm starts by preparing the state @xmath37 and two auxiliary modes in the @xmath38 quadrature eigenstates , i.e. , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "we apply the operator @xmath41 @xmath42 times . each operator can be implemented based on eq .",

    ", the successful rate of the last measurement is vanishing . in practice , however , when squeezed vacuum states are employed as auxiliary modes , the successful rate of obtaining an answer state with error @xmath48 scales as @xmath49 , which is comparable to the discrete - variable algorithm that has success which scales as @xmath50  @xcite .",
    "the detailed argument is shown in appendix c.    _ principal component analysis  _",
    "the next problem is to find the eigenvalue @xmath51 corresponding to a unit eigenvector @xmath52 with respect to the matrix @xmath53 , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "this problem is ubiquitous in science and engineering and can also be used in quantum tomography , supervised learning and cluster assignment .",
    "the algorithm starts from a data state @xmath55 and an auxiliary mode @xmath46 prepared as the zero eigenstate of the @xmath38 quadrature , @xmath39 .",
    "the idea of the algorithm is to apply the operator @xmath56 that displaces the auxiliary mode according to the eigenvalue , i.e. , e^i _ |_i|0_q,=    measuring the auxiliary mode with homodyne detection .",
    "this operator can be implemented by preparing an ensemble such that the density matrix is @xmath57 , and repeatedly apply the techniques in eq .",
    "( [ eq : erho ] ) to implement @xmath58 , for @xmath59 times . here",
    "the argument of the exponential swap operator is not a c - number but an operator @xmath60 .",

    "( [ eq : eswap ] ) by the three - mode operator r(_r ) = e^i _ ( _ 1_2^+ _ 1^_2 )  , which can be efficiently implemented by a cubic phase gate and linear optics @xcite .    in practice ,",
    "the success of the algorithm relies on the distinguishability of @xmath61 , which depends on the spectrum of eigenvalues , the degree of squeezing @xmath62 of the auxiliary state , and the magnitude of error . in appendix",
    "d , we have shown that @xmath63 operations are needed for an error @xmath64 .",
    "_ vector distance ",
    "_ in supervised machine learning , new data is categorized into groups by its similarity to the previous data . for example , the belonging category of a vector @xmath65 is determined by the distance , @xmath66 , to the average value of the previous data @xmath67 .",
    "the objective of a quantum machine learning algorithm is to compute the value @xmath68 .    following the approach given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume an oracle can generate the state |= ( |||0_i |+ _ i = i^m |_i||i_i |_i )  , where the first mode is denoted as the index mode @xmath69 ; the normalization @xmath70 is supposed to be known .",
    "@xmath71 can be obtained by conducting a swap test on the index mode with a reference mode prepared as @xmath72 .",
    "various swap tests for cv systems have been proposed where the result is obtained from a photon number measurement  @xcite .",
    "here we propose a swap test that employs only homodyne detection and an exponential swap operation .",
    "we consider two test modes that are prepared in the coherent states @xmath73 .",
    "the operator @xmath74 is applied to exponential swap the two test modes , as well as the reference and the index modes . after that , the test modes pass through a @xmath75 beam splitter .",
    "the density operator of the test modes after tracing out the other modes becomes _ 12 & = & ( | _ 11 | + i d^2 |_11 | + & & - i d^2 | _ 11 | + |_11 |)|_22|  .we find that if the @xmath76 mode is homodyne detected in the @xmath77 quadrature and @xmath78 , the probability difference of measuring a positive and negative outcome scales as @xmath71 , where the scaling constant is at the order of @xmath79 for a wide range of @xmath80 .",
    "see appendix e for further details .",
    "in this section , we outline an all - photonic implementation of the previously mentioned machine learning algorithms .",
    "first , one must create an ancillary state for use in the exponential swap gate .",
    "one method is to provide a heralded ancilla via parametric down conversion  ( see for example @xcite , for background on a lot of the standard quantum optics methods discussed here ) .",
    "the undetected photon is interfered with the vacuum on a @xmath75 beam splitter in order to place it in the superposition required for eq .",
    "( [ eq : eswap ] ) ( see fig .  [ fig1.eps ] ) .",
    "this serves as an input to the phase - dependent gates outlined in  @xcite , which can be used to construct the exponential swap gate . the rotation gate in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eswap ] ) is essentially the interference of the two modes on a variable reflectivity , or programmable beam splitter , which can be achieved via polarization control and a polarizing beam splitter , or via a collection of phase or amplitude modulators .",
    "inverse phase - dependent gate operations are implemented after the rotation .",
    "each algorithm essentially utilizes a variation of this configuration , in addition to the possibility of squeezed ancilla in order to increase the accuracy of the result .",
    "the principle component analysis problem replaces the variable beam splitter in the swap gate with a two - mode quantum - non - demolition phase gate .",
    "it can be implemented by treating the auxiliary mode , @xmath46 , as the ancilla in the phase - dependent gate .",
    "thus , the principle component analysis problem essentially relies on repeated application of the ` repeat - until - success ' phase gate  @xcite . in a realistic scenario , @xmath46 is in a single - mode squeezed state with finite squeezing ( see appendix c.2 ) , which is experimentally straightforward using a below - threshold optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) .",
    "phase sensitive amplification can also be used .",
    "the squeezing parameter can be used to tune the accuracy of the computation .",
    "the final homodyne detection is also experimentally straight forward with a local oscillator derived from the pump laser used in the opa ( via a doubling cavity , for instance ) .",
    "the matrix inversion algorithm is experimentally very similar to the eigenvalue problem .",
    "the key difference is the use of an extra auxiliary mode , which can be prepared independently with an additional opa .",
    "the four - mode operator is conceptually similar to the operator in eq .",
    "( 6 ) used in the previous algorithm .",
    "each auxiliary mode serves as an ancilla in the phase - dependent gate , and the algorithm otherwise follows a similar approach to the previous one , with a final homodyne detection step for the amplitude quadrature of each auxiliary mode , with the local oscillators derived from the pumps of each opa .",
    "finally , the vector distance algorithm requires use of a swap test , which can be implemented via the application of the exponential swap gate between two auxiliary states ( which can be coherent states or squeezed states ) and the oracle mode in eq .",
    "( 10 )  @xcite and the reference mode .",
    "the required homodyne detection of the phase quadrature of the first test mode in a bright coherent state and is again experimentally straight forward .",
    "the previous all - photonic implementations are difficult to do experimentally but are still within current reach of the latest technological achievements .",
    "for instance , high rates of squeezing are now achievable  @xcite , along with the generation of cat states  @xcite .",
    "however , we note that our scheme is not limited to photonic demonstrations but a variety of substrates , including spin ensemble systems , such as trapped atoms and solid state defect centers  @xcite .",
    "we hope that the work presented here will lead to further avenues of research . especially since there has been a substantial increase of results in discrete - variable machine learning  @xcite .",
    "all of these would be interesting to be generalized to continuous variables as future work . additionally , adapting our current work into the cluster - state formulism  @xcite would also be interesting in order to take advantage of state - of - the - art experimental interest and the scalability that continuous variables can provide  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we note another viable option that uses a ` best - of - both - worlds ' approach to quantum information processing , i.e. , hybrid schemes  @xcite . it would be interesting to adapt our scheme presented here to such hybrid architectures .",
