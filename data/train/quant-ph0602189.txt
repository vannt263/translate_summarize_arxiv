    "then , the qudit state would be described by their diagonal elements .",
    "therefore , a discrete quantum state ( qudit ) is coded by @xmath327 probability distributions .    for each @xmath179 in the group ,",
    "the elements in the operator symbol @xmath328 are the probabilities to obtain the values @xmath329 in a measurement of the quantum state @xmath199 by an apparatus oriented along @xmath179 .",
    "therefore the problem of reconstructing the state @xmath199 from the set of @xmath330 operator symbol elements is identical to the reconstruction of the density matrix of a spin through stern - gerlach experiments , already discussed in the literature@xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the tomographic operator symbols satisfy @xmath331 therefore , they are probability distributions @xmath332 .    one defines the _ operator symbol entropy _ by @xmath333 and the _ operator symbol rnyi entropies _ by @xmath334    likewise , we may define the _ operator symbol relative q - entropy _ by @xmath335 with @xmath336 because the operator symbols @xmath337 are probability distributions , they inherit all the known properties of nonnegativity , additivity , joint convexity , etc . of classical information theory .",
    "the relation of the operator symbol entropies to the von neumann and the quantum rnyi entropies is given by the following    the von neumann @xmath338 and the quantum rnyi @xmath339 entropies are the minimum on the unitary group of @xmath340 and @xmath341 .",
    "_ proof _ : from @xmath342 there is a @xmath343 such that @xmath344 is a diagonal matrix @xmath345 .",
    "then @xmath346 for any other @xmath179 , the diagonal elements in ( [ tt1 ] ) are convex linear combinations of @xmath347 . by convexity of @xmath348",
    "the result follows for the von neumann entropy .",
    "the operator symbol rnyi entropy is not a sum of concave functions .",
    "however , the following function is , @xmath349 called the tsallis entropy@xcite and related to the rnyi@xcite entropy by @xmath350    the minimum result now applies to @xmath351 by concavity and then one checks from ( [ tt2 ] ) that it also holds for @xmath341 .",
    "therefore @xmath352 coincides with the quantum rnyi entropy @xmath353 @xmath220    the entropy @xmath340 varies from the minimum , which is von neumann entropy , to a maximum for the most random distribution . for each given state @xmath199 , one can also define the _ integral entropies _",
    "@xmath354 where @xmath355 is the invariant haar measure on unitary group .    in some cases",
    ", the properties of the von neumann entropy may be derived as simple consequences of the classical - like properties of the operator symbol entropies .",
    "for example :    * subadditivity : * @xmath356    consider a two - partite system with density matrix @xmath357@xmath358 @xmath179 being a @xmath359 unitary matrix @xmath360    from the reduced symbols and density matrices @xmath361 @xmath362 one writes the reduced symbol entropies @xmath363 @xmath364 for each fixed @xmath179 , the tomographic symbols are ordinary probability distributions .",
    "therefore , by the subadditivity of classical entropy , @xmath365 in particular , this is true for the group element in @xmath366 that diagonalizes the reduced density matrices @xmath367 and @xmath368 .",
    "therefore , @xmath369 but , by the minimum property , @xmath370    thus subadditivity for the von neumann entropy is a consequence of subadditivity for the operator symbol entropies .",
    "the situation concerning strong subadditivity is different .",
    "strong subadditivity also holds , of course , for the operator symbol entropies for any @xmath179@xmath371 but the corresponding relation for the von neumann entropy is not a direct consequence of ( [ tt3 ] ) .",
    "the strong subadditivity@xcite for the von neumann entropy @xmath372 expressed in operator symbol entropies would be @xmath373 where @xmath374 are the different group elements that diagonalize the respective subspaces .",
    "therefore strong subadditivity for the von neumann entropy ( [ tt4 ] ) and strong subadditivity for the operator symbol entropies ( [ tt3 ] ) are independent properties . on the other hand , because of the invertible relation ( [ equation29 ] ) between the operator symbols and the density matrix , eq.([tt3 ] ) contains in fact a family of new inequalities for functionals of the density matrix .",
    "to conclude we summarize the main results of this work :        \\(iii ) evolution equations for qudit operator symbols are written in the form of first - order partial differential equations with generators describing the left regular representation of the unitary group .",
    "\\(vi ) in view of the probability nature of the operator symbols , the corresponding entropies inherit the properties of classical information theory .",
    "some of the properties of the von neumann entropy and quantum rnyi entropy are direct consequences of these properties . on the other hand",
    "the properties of the operator symbol entropies also imply new relations for functionals of the density matrix ."
