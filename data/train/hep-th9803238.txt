    "stimulated by the string theory , the higher ( than 4 ) dimensional ( super ) gravity becomes more and more important as its low - energy ( field theory ) limit . in order to understand the coming new concept involved in the string dynamics , it seems to become important to analyze the higher dim gravity as the quantum field theory .",

    "the present analysis aims at developing some useful approaches in such analysis .    in @xmath3-dimensional euclidean ( minkowski ) flat space(-time ) , fields are classified as scalar , spinor , vector , tensor ... , by the transformation property under the global so(n ) ( so(n-1,1 ) ) transformation of space(-time ) coordinates .",

    "is @xmath10 , is uniquely given by riemann scalar curvature @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 it is well - known that the general relativity can be constructed purely within the flat space first by introducing a symmetric second rank tensor ( fierz - pauli field ) and then by requiring consistency in the field equation in a perturbative way of the weak field @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "we can obtain the perturbed lagrangian simply by the perturbation around the flat space .",
    "@xmath13 then the transformation ( [ intro.2 ] ) is expressed as @xmath14 in the right - hand side ( rhs ) , there appear @xmath15-order terms and @xmath16-order terms . therefore the general",

    "( this is the reason why the result based on the lower - order weak - field perturbation restores all higher - order terms after the requirement of the general invariance . )",
    "riemann scalar curvature is also expanded as @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",

    "we may regard the weak field perturbation using ( [ intro.4 ] ) as a sort of linear representation of the general coordinate symmetry , where all general invariant quantities are generally expressed by the infinite series of power of @xmath17 , and there appears no inverse fields .",
    "one advantage of the linear representation is that the independence of invariants , as a local function of @xmath27 , can be clearly shown because all quantities are written only by @xmath17 and its derivatives .",
