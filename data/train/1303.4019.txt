    "the marinatto - weber ( mw ) scheme @xcite has become one of the most frequently used quantum game schemes . though it was created for research on nash equilibria in quantum @xmath2 games , it has also found application in studying some of the refinements of a nash equilibrium like evolutionarily stable strategies @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been proved that the mw scheme is applicable to finite extensive games @xcite and even various problems of duopoly @xcite .",
    "these recent papers show uninterrupted interest in research on quantum games played according to the mw idea and they provide sufficient motivation to improve the existing results . + our comment mainly concerns frequently cited paper @xcite , where the concept of quantum @xmath1 game was introduced .",
    "however , it also relates to the later paper @xcite , where the same concept was used .",
    "the possibility of recovering classical game from its quantum counterpart is a necessary condition for any quantum game scheme to be treated as a correct one . in the case of the mw scheme",
    "the classical game is obtained by putting the initial state @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , the marinatto - weber construction allows us to recover the classical game by putting any basis state @xmath5 , @xmath6 as the initial state .",
    "if , for example , the initial state equals @xmath7 we obtain the classical bimatrix with the only difference that the columns of the bimatrix are permuted .",
    "another case , in which the initial state @xmath8 or @xmath9 ( see , for instance , the battle of the sexes game studied in @xcite ) . + it turns out that this natural feature of the mw scheme is not transferred to iqbal and toor s generalization . for technical convenience ,",
    "let us number the computational states from 0 to 2 instead of iqbal and toor s numbering from 1 to 3 .",
    "definitions of unitary strategies @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 introduced in @xcite , but with respect to numbering from 0 to 2 are as follows : @xmath13 and they mean , respectively , the first , the second and the third strategy for each player .",
    "although their protocol yields the classical @xmath1 game if @xmath14 , it gives nonequivalent games for other basis states . putting , for example , @xmath15 , the bimatrix of a @xmath16 game changes as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18",
    "the output game is not equivalent ( up to the order of the columns ) to the input one .",
    "instead , we obtain the game in which the outcomes @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are no longer available . obviously , such a change affects a game significantly .",
    "however , in our opinion , transformation ( [ equation1 ] ) should not be caused by another basis state .",
    "according to theory of quantum correlations , superior results can be created only by entangled states @xcite . therefore non - classical transformation ( [ equation1 ] )",
    "obtained simply by a separable basis state suggests some irregularity in the iqbal and toor s approach .",
    "obviously , the undesirable property ( [ equation1 ] ) translates into any superpositions of states",
    ". + it is not difficult to note that the problem lies in the definition of operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 . although the players are provided with the identity operator @xmath10 , the operators @xmath12 and @xmath11 act like the identity operator for states @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively",
    ". in consequence , player 2 is not able to change her state from @xmath22 to @xmath23 which makes some of the outcomes unavailable .",
    "consider an @xmath24 bimatrix game @xmath25 where @xmath26 and define @xmath27 unitary operators @xmath28 for @xmath29 , that act on states of the computational basis @xmath30 according to this extension of the mw scheme , for the game ( [ equation2 ] ) one obtains the final state @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are probability distributions over @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the density operator for a state @xmath37 , and the payoff operator @xmath38 then the average payoff pair is given by the formula @xmath39 let us determine the output bimatrix corresponding to the initial state @xmath5 in order to prove the correctness of the scheme ( [ equation2])([przedostatni ] ) .",
    "equations ( [ equation4])([przedostatni ] ) imply the following bimatrix : @xmath40 as a result , we obtain the bimatrix which is equivalent to ( [ equation2 ] ) from a game - theoretic point of view . the only difference between them",
    "is that now rows and columns are numbered from @xmath41 and @xmath42 instead of zero . in particular , in the problem ( [ equation1 ] )",
    "the bimatrix on the right hand side takes now the following form : @xmath43 and it differs from the original one in the numbering order .",
    "the idea of playing @xmath1 games and the examination of evolutionarily stable strategies in the language of quantum games propounded by iqbal and toor in @xcite and @xcite show a great area of research into quantum games .",
    "it suggests that the number of open problems in theory of quantum games may be equal to the number of classical game theory concepts that have not been studied yet in the quantum mechanics environment .",
    "+ we have refined iqbal and toor s generalization to inherit the mw - scheme features . surprisingly , the output game ( [ ostatni ] ) coincides with iqbal and toor s one @xcite if the input game is their modified rock - scissors - paper game and the final state is @xmath44 ) provides us with a quite different output game than the one defined by iqbal and toor .",
    "therefore , we claim that our scheme scheme ought to be used in the case of studying more complex games .",
