    "@xcite for its applications in lattice gauge theory .    the basic idea of  ref .",
    "@xcite is the following : consider the pure yang  mills theory .",
    "the gradient flow deforms the bare gauge field  @xmath0 according to a flow equation with a flow time  @xmath1 [ eq .   below ] and this makes gauge field configurations `` smooth '' for positive flow times .",
    "it can then be shown to all orders in perturbation theory that any local products of the flowed gauge field  @xmath2 for any strictly positive flow time  @xmath1 is ultraviolet ( uv ) finite when expressed in terms of renormalized parameters  @xcite . in particular , no multiplicative renormalization factor is required to make those local products finite . in other words , they are renormalized composite operators .",
    "such uv - finite quantities should be `` universal '' in the sense that they are independent of the uv regularization chosen , in the limit in which the regulator is removed .",
    "this suggests a possibility that by using the gradient flow as an intermediate tool one may bridge composite operators defined with the dimensional regularization , with which the translational invariance is manifest , and those in the lattice regularization with which one may carry out non - perturbative calculations .",
    "following this idea , a formula that expresses the correctly normalized conserved energy ",
    "momentum tensor as a @xmath3 limit of a certain combination of the flowed gauge field was derived  @xcite .",
    "this formula provides a possible method to compute correlation functions of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor by using the lattice regularization because the universal combination in the formula should be independent of the regularization .",
    "an interesting point is that the small flow - time behavior of the ( universal ) coefficients in the formula can be determined by perturbation theory thanks to the asymptotic freedom .",
    "this implies that if the lattice spacing is fine enough a further non - perturbative determination of the coefficients is not necessary .",
    "( practically , non - perturbative determination of those coefficients may be quite useful and how this determination can be carried out has been investigated in  ref .",
    "although the validity of the formula in  ref .",
    "@xcite , especially the restoration of the conservation law in the continuum limit , still remains to be carefully investigated , the measurement of the interaction measure ( the trace anomaly ) and the entropy density of the yang  mills theory at finite temperature on the basis of the formula  @xcite shows encouraging results ; the method appears to be promising even practically .    in  ref .",
    "@xcite , the method was developed only for the pure yang ",
    "mills theory .",
    "it is then natural to ask for wider application if the method can be generalized to gauge theories containing matter fields , especially fermion fields . in the present paper",
    ", we work out this generalization .",
    "we thus suppose a vector - like gauge theory with a gauge group  @xmath4 that contains @xmath5 for simplicity , we assume that all @xmath6 fermions possess a common mass ; this restriction might be appropriately relaxed .",
    "our main result is eq .  , and a step - by - step derivation of this master formula is given in subsequent sections .",
    "for those who are interested mainly in the final result , here we give a brief explanation of how to read the master formula  : the left - hand side is the correctly normalized conserved energy ",
    "momentum tensor ( with the vacuum expectation value subtracted ) ; our formula   holds only when the energy  momentum tensor is separated from other operators in correlation functions in the position space .",
    "the combinations in the right - hand side are defined by  eqs .",
    ". there , @xmath7 and  @xmath8 are the field strength and the covariant derivative of the flowed gauge field , respectively ( the definition of the flowed gauge field is identical to that of  refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; our _ ringed _ flowed fermion fields @xmath9 and  @xmath10 are , on the other hand , somewhat different from those of  ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath11 and  @xmath12 , and they are related by  eqs .   and  .",
    "the coefficient functions @xmath13 in  eq .   are given by  eqs .",
    ". there , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the running coupling and the running mass parameter defined by eqs .   and  , respectively ; throughout this paper , @xmath16 denotes the ( common ) renormalized mass of the fermions .",
    "equations   are for the minimal subtraction ( @xmath17 ) scheme and the result for the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath18 ) scheme can be obtained by the replacement  .",
    "@xmath19 and  @xmath20 are the first coefficients of renormalization group functions , eq .",
    "and  eq .  ,",
    "respectively . the energy ",
    "momentum tensor is given by the @xmath3 limit in the right - hand side of  eq .  .",
    "as in the pure yang  mills case mentioned above , the combination in the right - hand side is uv finite and one may use the lattice regularization to compute the correlation functions of the combination in the right - hand side . in this way , correlation functions of the correctly normalized conserved energy ",
    "momentum tensor are obtained . to ensure the `` universality , '' however , the continuum limit has to be taken before the @xmath3 limit .",
    "practically , with a finite lattice spacing  @xmath21 , the flow time  @xmath1 can not be taken arbitrarily small to keep the contact with the continuum physics . instead , we have a natural constraint , @xmath22 where  @xmath23 denotes a typical physical scale , such as the hadronic scale or the box size .",
    "the extrapolation for  @xmath3 thus generally requires a sufficiently fine lattice .    here is our definition of the quadratic casimir operators : we set the normalization of anti - hermitian generators  @xmath24 of the representation  @xmath23 as  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 .",
    "we also denote @xmath27 . from the structure constants in  @xmath28=f^{abc}t^c$ ] , we define @xmath29 . for example , for the fundamental @xmath30  representation of  @xmath31 for which @xmath32 , the conventional normalization is @xmath33",
    "the description of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor in gauge theory  @xcite is particularly simple with the dimensional regularization .",
    "this is because this regularization manifestly preserves the ( vectorial ) gauge symmetry and the translational invariance .",
    "thus , in this section , we briefly recapitulate basic facts concerning the energy  momentum tensor on the basis of the dimensional regularization .",
    "the action of the system under consideration in a @xmath34  dimensional euclidean space is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and  @xmath37 are bare gauge coupling and the mass parameter , respectively .",

    "our gamma matrices are hermitian and for the trace over the spinor index we set @xmath42 for any  @xmath34 .",
    "we also set @xmath43    assuming the dimensional regularization , one can derive a ward ",
    "takahashi relation associated with the translational invariance straightforwardly .",
    "we consider the following infinitesimal variation of integration variables in the functional integral : @xmath44 then , since the action changes as @xmath45 where the energy  momentum tensor  @xmath46 is defined by @xmath47 \\notag\\\\     & \\qquad { }     + \\frac{1}{4 }     \\bar{\\psi}(x)\\left(\\gamma_\\mu\\overleftrightarrow{d}_\\nu     + \\gamma_\\nu\\overleftrightarrow{d}_\\mu\\right)\\psi(x )     -\\delta_{\\mu\\nu}\\bar{\\psi}(x )     \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\overleftrightarrow{{{\\ooalign{\\hfil/\\hfil\\crcr$d$ } } } }     + m_0\\right)\\psi(x ) , \\label{eq:(2.7)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath48 we have @xmath49 where @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is a collection of gauge - invariant operators localized inside ( outside ) the finite integration region  @xmath52 .",
    "this relation shows that the energy ",
    "momentum tensor generates the infinitesimal translation and , at the same time , the bare quantity   does not receive the multiplicative renormalization .",
    "thus , we define a renormalized finite energy  momentum tensor by subtracting its ( possibly divergent ) vacuum expectation value : @xmath53    a fundamental property of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor is the trace anomaly  @xcite .",
    "one simple way to derive this  @xcite is to set @xmath54 in  eq .   and compare the resulting relation with the renormalization group equation . after some consideration , this yields @xmath55 where we assume that the renormalized operators in the right - hand side are defined in the @xmath17 scheme  @xcite .",
