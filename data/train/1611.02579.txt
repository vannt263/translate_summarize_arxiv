    "long after the recognition that zz ceti pulsations might be used to understand the internal structures of white dwarfs , these stars remain enigmatic . for most individual zz ceti stars with stable , resolved pulsation spectra ,",
    "the number of periods is small and the radial order ( @xmath3 ) and spherical harmonic degree ( @xmath0 ) unknown . as a result",
    ", any comparison between the eigenmodes of pulsational models and observed periods is underconstrained .",
    "thus , even when a few observed periods in a star are well - matched by a few eigenperiods from a model , we can not be certain that this match implies the model has a structure resembling that of the actual star .",
    "this shortcoming in zz ceti seismology has been addressed in a variety of ways : by using fully evolutionary models with diffusion to reduce the number of free parameters that must be fitted @xcite ; by improving the spectroscopic determinations of mass and gravity @xcite ; and by long - timebase or high - sensitivity observing campaigns to detect more modes and resolve them into multiplets that can constrain @xmath0 if not @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "@xcite noticed that the short period modes from hot zz ceti stars compiled into one diagram defined a pattern with distinct period groupings separated by gaps , and suggested that studying the structure in this ensemble diagram might help to resolve the degeneracy in the fitting process .",
    "one reason for this is that geometric cancellation should result in the largest modes being mostly @xmath1 , so uncertainties arising from individual mode identification are reduced in the ensemble diagram .",
    "another is that the mean periods of the groups formed by the largest modes depend on the average mass and temperature of the ensemble , which are more robustly known from spectroscopy than those for any star alone , reducing the number of free parameters .    for stars with a narrow distribution in mass , as is known to be true for white dwarfs , a pattern like that found by @xcite is expected from pulsation theory .",
    "the left hand panel of figure [ fig : clemens_j_fig1 ] , reproduced from @xcite illustrates this point .",
    "the figure shows low - order @xmath1 eigenmode periods for evolutionary models near the mean of all white dwarf masses . for a wide variety of hydrogen layer masses ( @xmath4 ) , which is treated as a free parameter",
    ", the periods of the low order modes will accumulate near one of the solid yellow horizontal lines in the diagram . although these theoretical periods will be different for models with mass not equal to the value in this plot ( 0.593 @xmath5 ) , the narrowness of the observed field white dwarf mass distribution @xcite allows the @xmath1 period groups to remain distinct for the lowest radial overtones .",
    "@xcite collected the observed periods for 11 hot zz ceti stars and found suggestions of an emergent pattern , but small - number statistics and lack of certain @xmath0 identification limited the application of the ensemble technique .",
    "now , 22 years later , we have repeated this exercise for 75 known hot zz cetis , most of them still without secure mode identification . as the top panel of figure [ fig : clemens_j_fig2 ] shows ,",
    "the evidence for grouping is still apparent .",
    "the gap in periods between 220 and 250 s is particularly striking , and aligns with the region between predicted mode periods in the models of figure [ fig : clemens_j_fig1 ] .",
    "the existence of this gap and other features argues against allowing the hydrogen layer mass to vary freely , because @xmath1 , @xmath6 models in the crossing region near @xmath7 would populate the gap , conflicting with the observations .",
    "likewise , the appearance of a grouping of periods in the 100 - 120 s range suggests that a significant fraction of the stars have the thickest possible @xmath4 allowed by nuclear burning , which is around @xmath8 for this model . to illustrate these points we have converted the period distribution in the top panel of figure [ fig : clemens_j_fig2 ] into a histogram and added it to the right of the romero diagram in figure [ fig : clemens_j_fig1 ] .",
    "this ensemble of observed periods still suffers from the drawback that we do not know which modes are @xmath1 , so the observed distribution likely combines modes of different @xmath0 , while the theoretical diagram has only periods for @xmath1 modes .",
    "likewise , we do not know the azimuthal degree @xmath9 of the modes , but for periods below 400 s and typical rotation periods of 1 d , the ambiguities from @xmath9 identification are typically less than 1 s.    fortunately , it is now possible to improve this diagram by restricting ourselves to a subset of stars for which we have independent knowledge of the sperical degree of the eigenperiods observed .",
    "the number of stars for which this is possible has recently increased owing to discovery and short cadence observations of new zz ceti stars by the _ kepler _ and _ k2 _ missions .",
    "these new zz cetis will be the subject of a series of forthcoming papers by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : clemens_j_fig3 ] shows the fourier transform of _",
    "k2 _ data accumulated over 78.7 days at 60 s cadence for one such star . in addition , improved ground - based observations of gd 165 and r 548 ( zz ceti ) @xcite , gd 66 and g238 - 53 @xcite , lp133 - 144 @xcite , and other well - known stars have added to our knowledge of their multiplet structure .",
    "the subset of hot zz ceti stars with @xmath0 identification we consider in this paper includes eight new stars from _ kepler _ and eight previously known examples .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ fig : clemens_j_fig2 ] shows the periods of those modes in these stars which we identify as @xmath1 on the basis of rotational splitting or , in the case of g117-b15a , arguments from multicolor photometry @xcite and combination mode amplitudes @xcite .",
    "in order to compare these measured @xmath10 eigenperiods with the models , we have converted the lower panel of figure [ fig : clemens_j_fig2 ] into a histogram that appears in the top panel of figure [ fig : clemens_j_fig4 ] .",
    "we interperet this histogram as a sequence of consecutive @xmath3 from 1 to 4 . to compare these periods to the seismological prediction of evolutionary models",
    ", we used the published grid of @xmath1 periods from @xcite to conduct monte carlo simulations of the observed sample . using the measured spectroscopic masses and temperatures for the stars , with suitable gaussian errors applied , we drew 50 simulated period spectra for the sample of 16 stars ( 1900 periods in all ) , keeping only those @xmath3 for each star that match the ones observed in its period spectrum .",
    "we have plotted these simulations for a number of assumptions in the four lower panels of figure [ fig : clemens_j_fig4 ] .",
    "the second and third panels show the simulated periods drawn from the romero models under the assumption that all stars have the canonically thick @xmath4 .",
    "the temperatures and gravities used in the second panel are from the 1d models of @xcite while the third panel shows the values corrected for the three - dimensional dependence of convection @xcite . in their overall appearance",
    ", these two simulations most resemble the data .",
    "they have a group at 100 - 120 s , and clean gaps between the lower @xmath3 modes .",
    "however , the periods of the @xmath11 mode groups do not match the data ; the spacing between modes of consecutive @xmath3 in the models is systematically too small .",
    "we experimented with uniformly decreasing the masses in the models to spread out the overtones , and found that a roughly 10% decrease would be required , and this would still not improve the match to the @xmath6 group .",
    "a systematic mass error of 10% in all the stars is implausible , but a more promising approach is to alter the mass of the helium layer @xmath12 . we have used quasi - evolutionary models to experiment with thinner layers and this approach shows promise .",
    "we will pursue this approach further in a forthcoming paper .    finally , we have also calculated simulations in which @xmath4 is allowed to vary from the canonical limit .",
    "these do not match the data as well inasmuch as they lack a clear group at 100 - 120 seconds , and the gaps between consecutive @xmath3 are not clean .",
    "this comports with the expectations we developed based on figure [ fig : clemens_j_fig1 ] ; varying @xmath4 allows stars to have periods in between the yellow accumulation lines on the diagram and does not select the correct fraction of stars with modes near 100 s. the fourth panel shows models in which @xmath4 was treated as a random variable , while the bottom panel uses the distribution of @xmath4 found by @xcite using individual seismological fits to an ensemble of stars with mostly unknown values of @xmath0 and @xmath3 .",
    "examining the ensemble of hot zz ceti pulsators with known @xmath0 shows a pattern of consecutive groups that we have identified with the lowest @xmath3 non - radial @xmath13-mode pulsations . analyzing this pattern offers a promising way to constrain seismological model parameters like @xmath4 and @xmath12 .",
    "the 16 stars in our sample suggest that most hot zz cetis have @xmath4 values at or near the canonical limit and that their helium layers are thinner than those calculated by evolutionary models .",
    "detailed model fits to individual stars informed by these results should allow us to extract believable asteroseismological measurements of zz ceti interior properties .",
