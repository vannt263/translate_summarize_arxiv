    "the wiretap channel model @xmath0 was introduced by wyner in 1975 @xcite . in this model , there are two receivers @xmath1 and a single transmitter @xmath2 .",
    "the transmitter aims at sending messages to receiver 1 through a communication channel @xmath3 .",
    "the information sent from @xmath2 to @xmath4 is also received by receiver 2 through another channel @xmath5 . the transmission problem in the system @xmath6",
    "calls for designing a coding system that supports communication between @xmath2 and @xmath4 in a way that is both reliable and secure .",
    "the reliability requirement is the usual one for communication systems , namely , that the error probability of decoding the information by @xmath4 be made arbitrarily low by increasing the block length of the encoding . at the same time , the transmission needs to be made secure in the sense that the information extracted by receiver 2 about the message of @xmath2 approaches zero as a function of the block length .    to describe the problem in formal terms , denote the input alphabet of the transmitter by @xmath7 , and the output alphabets of the channels @xmath3 and @xmath5 by @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "the messages that the transmitter can convey to receiver 1 form a finite set denoted below by @xmath10 for transmission over the channel the message is encoded using a mapping @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an @xmath13-fold repetition of the input alphabet .",
    "we say that @xmath14 is a length-@xmath13 block encoder of the transmitter .",
    "capacity - attaining schemes for the wiretap channel rely on randomized encoding , i.e. , a mapping that sends @xmath15 to a probability distribution on @xmath16 in other words , the message @xmath17 is encoded as a sequence @xmath18 with probability @xmath19 and the encoder is defined as a matrix of conditional probabilities @xmath20    the decoder of receiver 1 is a mapping @xmath21 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath22 and @xmath23 the conditional distributions induced by the channels @xmath3 and @xmath5 , respectively , and define the induced distributions @xmath24 where , for instance , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 refer to the @xmath28-th symbol of the vectors @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",

    ".   represents the reliability of communication condition while answers the security of transmission requirement .",
    "we note that in many works on transmission with a secrecy constraint the security condition was formulated in a more relaxed way , namely as the inequality @xmath36 this is particularly true about pre-1990s works in information theory , but also applies to some very recent works on the wiretap channel , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "however , as shown by maurer in @xcite , this constraint does not fulfill the intuitive security requirements in the system . more specifically , it is possible to construct examples in which inequality is satisfied and at the same time receiver 2 is capable of learning @xmath37 out of @xmath13 bits of the encoding @xmath38 in view of this , maurer suggested as a better alternative to condition . as a result , currently is called the `` weak security constraint '' as opposed to the stronger constraint . in this paper",
    "we design coding schemes that provide strong secrecy , so below we work only with condition .",
    "the secrecy capacity of the wiretap channel is defined as follows .",

    ", there were some constructive solutions even before the publication of arikan s seminal work @xcite .",
    "at the same time , these schemes applied only to some special cases of the channels @xmath52 for instance the case when @xmath3 is noiseless and @xmath5 is a binary erasure channel was addressed in @xcite which show that in this case the capacity @xmath46 can be achieved using low - density parity - check codes .",
    "the results in @xcite are based on the weak security assumption while strong security is considered in @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite extends the construction to the cases when both @xmath3 and @xmath5 are erasure channels , and when @xmath3 is noiseless and @xmath5 is a binary symmetric channel . as usual with the application of low - density codes ,",
    "the constructions are based on code ensembles and strictly speaking are not explicit .",
    "another special case of the wiretap channel relates to the combinatorial version of the erasure channel ( the so - called wiretap channel of type ii ) in which receiver 2 can choose to observe any @xmath53 symbols out of @xmath13 transmitted symbols .",
    "constructive capacity - achieving solutions for this case are based on mds codes @xcite or extractors @xcite .    in @xcite , it is shown that @xmath46 is achievable with strong security using invertible extractors , if both @xmath3 and @xmath5 are binary symmetric channels .",
    "both encoding and decoding algorithms in @xcite have polynomial complexity .",
    "moreover , @xcite also claims that its proof method can be easily extended to other wiretap channels as long as both @xmath3 and @xmath5 are symmetric .    after the introduction of polar codes by arikan , achieving @xmath46 via polar coding has been considered by different works , mostly under the degradedness assumption .",
    "recall that a channel @xmath54 is called _ degraded _ with respect to a channel @xmath55 if there exists a stochastic @xmath56 matrix @xmath57 such that for all @xmath58 @xmath59 the wiretap channel @xmath60 is called degraded if the channel to the eavesdropper is degraded with respect to the main channel . in this case theorem [ thm : dg ]",
    "affords a simpler formulation because there is no need in the auxiliary rv @xmath61 .",
    "namely , in the degraded case the secrecy capacity equals ( * ? ? ?",
    "* probl .",
    "17.8 ) @xmath62 ( this specialization is true under slightly more general assumptions , but we will not need them below ) .",
    "communication over degraded wiretap channels using polar codes was considered in a number of papers , notably , @xcite .",
    "the main result of these works is that secrecy capacity can be attained under the weak security constraint .",
    "we note that the degraded case is easier to handle with polar codes because of the specific nature of the polar codes construction ( more on this below in sect .",
    "[ sect : closer ] ) .",
    "another step was made by @xcite which suggested a polar coding scheme that attains the rate @xmath46 of a symmetric degraded wiretap channel @xmath0 under the strong security requirement .",
    "more details about the results of @xcite are given in sect .",
    "[ sect : closer ] below .",
    "the problem of attaining secrecy capacity of the general wiretap channel under the strong secrecy condition and without the degradedness assumption was further studied in @xcite .",
    "a polar coding scheme suggested in this work attains a transmission rate of @xmath63.$ ] clearly @xmath64 for all @xmath2 since one can take @xmath65 in the markov chain @xmath66 which appears in theorem [ thm : dg ] .",
    "it is not immediately clear for which channels the result of @xcite actually attains the secrecy capacity of @xmath67 at the same time , the coding scheme employed in @xcite relies on two nested layers of the polarizing transform .",
    "the decoder for the second ( outer ) layer works with the probability distribution generated by the first decoder , which is not easily computable .",
    "thus , the low complexity decoding claim of the construction made in @xcite is not supported by the known decoding procedures for polar codes . for these reasons the construction in @xcite",
    "does not resolve the question of constructing an explicit capacity - achieving scheme for the nondegraded case of wiretap channels .    in related works @xcite the problem of constructing capacity achieving schemes for wiretap channels",
    "was addressed for the case of quantum channels .",
    "the constructions suggested in these works attain symmetric secrecy capacity of quantum wiretap channels .",
    "these constructions require a shared secret key between the transmitter and receiver 1 .",
    "this requirement seems to be intrinsic to polar code constructions for this problem including our work .",
    "however the constructions in @xcite require a positive - rate shared key , which results in a communication scheme that transmits at rates separated from capacity .",
    "to summarize , to the best of our knowledge the question of constructing explicit capacity - achieving transmission schemes for the non - degraded wiretap channel with strong secrecy is an open problem .",
    "it is this problem that we aim to solve in this paper by removing the degradedness assumption .",
    "we also do not assume that either of the channels @xmath68 is symmetric .",
    "the main idea of our work is to exploit the markov chain conditions intrinsic to secure communication problems using polar codes . in section [",
    "sect : wt ] we propose a polar coding scheme that attains the secrecy capacity under the strong security assumption .",
    "both the encoding and decoding complexity estimates of our construction are @xmath69 , where @xmath13 is the length of the encoding . in section [ csiszar - korner ]",
    "we generalize our construction to cover the case when a part of transmitter s message is public , i.e. , is designed to be conveyed both to receivers 1 and 2 .",
    "this model , called a broadcast channel with confidential messages , is in fact the principal model in the founding work of csiszr and krner @xcite on this topic .",
    "apart from the basic polar coding results @xcite , our solution of the described problems relies on the previous work on the wiretap channel @xcite , the polar coding scheme for the broadcast channel of @xcite , and the construction of polar codes for general memoryless channels in @xcite .",
    "a new idea introduced in our solution is related to a stochastic encoding scheme that emulates the random coding proof of the capacity theorem in @xcite , whereby polarization is used for the values of the auxiliary random variable @xmath61 in theorem [ thm : dg ] , followed by a stochastic encoding into a channel codeword .",
    "another insight , which is particularly useful for the broadcast channel result in sect .",
    "[ sect : bcc ] , is related to a partition of the coordinates of the transmitted block that enables simultaneous decoding of different parts of the transmitted message by both receivers , whereby the decoder of polar codes is used by the receivers according to their high- and low - entropy bits .",
    "it becomes possible to show that the receivers recover the bits designed to communicate with each of them with high probability , and that the secret part of the message is not accessible to the unintended recipient .",
    "we begin with recalling basic notation for polar codes and then continue with the scheme for capacity - achieving communication on discrete binary - input channels .",
    "let @xmath70 be a binary - input channel with the output alphabet @xmath71 input alphabet @xmath72 and the conditional probability distribution @xmath73 throughout the paper we denote the capacity and the symmetric capacity of @xmath70 by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",

    "the material in this section and section [ sect : asymmetric ] is well understood , but it merits some space in the present paper because it helps us to define the terminology that is useful for the main results below . given a symmetric binary - input channel @xmath70 , define the channel @xmath96 with input alphabet @xmath97 and output alphabet @xmath98 by the conditional distribution @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the conditional distribution that defines @xmath70 . define a combined channel @xmath101 by the conditional distribution @xmath102 in terms of @xmath101 , the channel seen by the @xmath28-th bit @xmath103 ( also known as the bit - channel of the @xmath28-th bit ) can be written as @xmath104 where @xmath105 .",

    "the transmission scheme can be described as follows : a message of @xmath118 bits is written in the bits @xmath119 the remaining @xmath120 bits of @xmath121 are set to 0 .",

    "[ rem : on ] there is a subtle point about the limit relations in .",
    "even though asymptotically the bit channels are either good or bad , it is not true that @xmath130 because there is a nonempty subset of indices @xmath131 of cardinality @xmath132 that is neither good nor bad .",
    "this distinction has no import for the simple situation of transmitting over @xmath70 , but leads to complications in the multi - user systems considered below ; see , e.g. , in section  [ sect : wt ] .",

    "once @xmath121 is determined , the transmitter finds @xmath153 and sends it over the channel .",
    "the receiver uses the following successive decoding function : for @xmath154 let @xmath155 note that this rule represents a map decoder for the @xmath28th subchannel , which for the symmetric case coincides with the ml decoder rule .",
    "the probability of decoding error can be bounded above similarly to : @xmath156 where the parameters have the same meaning as before .",
    "moreover , @xcite argues that there exists a set of deterministic maps @xmath157 such that holds true , stating the decoding rule in the form @xmath158 the mappings @xmath159 are shared between the transmitter and the receiver prior to communication .",
    "we shall use this form of the transmission scheme and the decoder throughout our paper .",
    "this completes the description of the capacity - achieving transmission scheme of @xcite .",
    "we will rely in part on these ideas in our construction of a coding scheme for the wiretap channel .",
    "to explain our proposal we will first discuss some of the schemes available in the literature .",
    "we begin with the transmission scheme of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "as already remarked , these works are concerned with the special case when the channel @xmath5 is degraded with respect to @xmath3 and aim to attain the rate value with weak secrecy .",

    "similarly to @xmath145 and @xmath139 given by , define the following subsets of indices : @xmath161 : z(u_i|u^{i-1},z^{n})\\geq 1-\\delta_n\\}\\\\ { \\mathscr l}_{x|z}&=\\{i\\in [ n ] : z(u_i|u^{i-1},z^{n})\\leq \\delta_n\\ }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath162 , and @xmath35 is the output that receiver 2 observes when the transmitter sends @xmath160 .",
    "partition the set @xmath114 $ ] as follows : @xmath163 note that the degradedness assumption implies the inclusion @xmath164 .",
    "the coding scheme for the wiretap channel relies on the partition and is summarized in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "the information is stored in the bits @xmath165 .",
    "the bits in the coordinates in @xmath166 are chosen randomly while the bits in @xmath167 form a subset of the frozen bits .",
    "attainability of the rate using this coding scheme is proved in the cited papers .",
    "an essential remark here is that the bits @xmath168 are randomly selected because fixing their values contradicts even the weak security constraint , let alone the stronger one .",
    "we note that generally @xmath169 and even though the number of coordinates in @xmath170 behaves as @xmath171 this constitutes an obstacle to achieving strong security .",
    "to bypass it , @xcite uses a different partition of the coordinates , namely @xmath172 apart from transmitting the information , the coding scheme aims to convey the bits in @xmath173 to receiver 1 using the good indices of receiver 1 , at the same time preserving the security requirement .",
    "this is accomplished using the `` chaining '' construction proposed in @xcite and shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] .",

    "the only remaining problem is to convey to receiver 1 the bits of @xmath191 of the first block .",
    "this is done by performing the seed transmission of a block which encodes the @xmath192 bits using some error correcting code of length @xmath13 . as claimed in @xcite ,",
    "it is possible to choose such a code to fulfill the reliability and security requirements because its rate can be made arbitrarily close to zero .",
    "the fact that the seed code needs to encode only a small number @xmath132 of message bits follows from the degradedness assumption , which is therefore essential in this construction .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this scheme satisfies both constraints and under the assumption that the channel to the eavesdropper is degraded with respect to the channel @xmath193 the rate of communication between the transmitter and receiver 1 can be made arbitrarily close to the value @xmath194 since the assumption that @xmath5 is degraded with respect to @xmath3 ensures that @xmath181 , i.e. , there is no asymptotic loss in rate by removing the bits @xmath195 from the message in order to support the strong security condition .",
