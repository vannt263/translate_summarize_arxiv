    "most of the currently available homogenization methods for strongly non - linear composites make use an underlying linear homogenization estimate , whether aimed at computing dielectric ( willis , 1986 ; zeng et al .",

    "the best results are obtained using an _ anisotropic _ linear estimate , the anisotropy of which is consistently determined , by the means and variances of the fields in each phase of the composite ( pellegrini , 2001 ; ponte castaeda , 2001 ) .",
    "the anisotropy of the underlying linear medium accounts for the privileged direction imposed by the driving field in the non - linear medium .    applying the `` second - order '' method ( ponte castaeda , 2002 ) to a random power - law material weakened by aligned cylindrical voids",
    ", it has been found that in the so - called  dilute \" limit ( i.e. ,  that of a vanishingly small volume fraction of porosity @xmath0 ) , and in the limit of infinite exponent where the matrix becomes ideally plastic with a yield threshold , the leading correction to the yield stress in pure shear behaves as @xmath1 .",
    "this result holds for both hashin - shtrikman and self - consistent estimates .",
    "the second - order method of pellegrini ( 2001 ) , suitably modified by replacing a gaussian ansatz for the field distributions by a heaviside ansatz ( so as to cut - off high fields in a way compatible with threshold - type materials ) , provides in some cases similar predictions ( pellegrini and ponte castaeda , 2001 , unpublished ) .",
    "this @xmath1 dilute behavior is unusual in the context of effective - medium theories for _ random _ media , where the low - order terms in dilute expansions from the literature usually consist in integer powers of @xmath0 . with the @xmath1 correction ,",
    "the derivative of the yield stress with respect to the porosity is infinite at @xmath2 , due to the exponent being lower than 1 .",
    "thus , a vanishingly small volume fraction of voids induces a dramatic weakening of the porous medium .",
    "ponte castaeda ( 1996 , 2002 ) interprets this phenomenon as an indication of localizing behavior in a regime where shear bands pass through the pores , remarking that the limit analysis of drucker ( 1966 ) produces an upper bound for the yield threshold with a dilute correction behaving as @xmath3 in 2d . numerical calculations and tests on perforated plates with periodically distributed holes ( francescato and pastor , 1998 )",
    "are consistent with these predictions in a plane stress situation . however , for a square network of circular holes , kinematic and static limit analyses result in the following analytical bounds on the effective yield stress @xmath4 ( francescato et al . , 2004 ) :",
    "@xmath5,\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the yield threshold of the matrix .",
    "numerical limit - analysis on a hollow disk model in plane strain leads to somewhat different conclusions , with a correction behaving roughly as @xmath1 for uniform strain boundary conditions , and as @xmath3 for uniform stress boundary conditions ( pastor and ponte castaeda,2002 ) .",
    "however , the calculations were not sufficiently accurate to be completely definitive . on the other hand ,",
    "the exponent is quite certainly associated with localizing behavior , and its presence seems to be independent on whether the system is random , periodic , or comprises a unique void ( although the actual values of the exponent may be dependent on the specific microstructure considered ) .",
    "because the second - order theory with exponent @xmath7 inherits its properties from an underlying anisotropic linear effective - medium theory , whose anisotropy is consistently determined by the field variances , a natural question concerns the `` localizing '' properties of the anisotropic linear theory itself , and its relation with possible non - analyticities of the effective shear moduli in the dilute limit . bearing these considerations in mind , the present paper focuses on a new _ exact _",
    "solution for the special , but representative , case of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) array of voids embedded in an anisotropic linear elastic matrix , in the singular limit of infinite anisotropy .",
    "we emphasize that no exact solution of a similar type is available for general non - linear periodic media , which provides additional motivation for undertaking this study .",
    "the constitutive laws , the prescribed loading conditions and the notations are defined in sec .  [ sec : setup ] .",
    "the word `` loading '' refers to the prescription of either overall conditions of homogeneous stress , or of homogeneous strain in the linear medium .",
    "both are equivalent since they are related by the effective moduli .",
    "the matrix in the composite is compressible and possesses anisotropic properties in shear .",
    "two special limits of infinite anisotropy which lead to exact results are then considered ( secs.[sec : ellzero ] and [ sec : ellinfty ] ) . for each of these limits , simple shear ,",
    "pure shear , and equibiaxial loading situations are examined , and solutions are provided in each case ( for some loading and anisotropy conditions however , only the limit of an incompressible matrix is considered ; but this limit is the one relevant to non - linear homogenization of plastic porous media ) . the effective moduli and their dilute expansions , together with the mean and variance of the strain and stress fields are computed in each case .",
    "all these quantities are relevant to non - linear homogenization theories . a useful way of condensing the information contained in the solutions is by using field distributions which can in principle directly be used to compute the effective energy ( pellegrini , 2001 ) or , more trivially , the moments of the fields .",
    "local extrema or saddle points in the field maps induce singularities in the distributions such as power or logarithmic divergences , or discontinuities , of the types observed in the density of states of a crystal ( van hove 1953 ; abrikosov , campuzano and gofron , 1993 ) .",
    "these singularities are examined in the context of our exact results .",
    "cule and torquato ( 1998 ) computed analytically the distributions of the electric field in a particular dielectric / conductor composite .",
    "they found singularities of the van hove type , but no extended singularities of the type put forward by abrikosov _",

    ", the loading modes considered below are aligned with the eigenstrains .",
    "these choices , motivated by future applications of this work to non - linear homogenization , focus on situations most relevant to plastic localization in porous media .",
    "indeed , in the nonlinear theory , the loading determines the anisotropy of the background linear medium and always coincides with one of its eigendirections .",
    "moreover , shear bands in random porous media quite generally link neighboring voids together .      in this work , we are concerned with the problem of determining the overall behavior of the periodic , porous material described in the previous subsection .",
    "this overall behavior is defined as the relation between the average stress @xmath60 and the average strain @xmath61 . under the assumption of separation of length scales",
    ", the overall behavior of the porous material may be determined from the effective strain potential ( see torquato , 2002 ) @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes an average over the matrix phase , @xmath64 is the strain potential in the matrix and @xmath65,$ ] @xmath66 @xmath67 is the set of kinematically admissible strain fields .",
    "the overall constitutive relation is then given by @xmath68 because of linearity , we define the overall elasticity tensor @xmath69 of the porous material via the relation @xmath70 . this tensor can be shown to take on the same form as ( [ eq : lmat ] ) with components @xmath71 defined by effective moduli @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "in the analyses below , it will sometimes be more convenient to work with the _ effective stress potential _ @xmath75 , such that the overall constitutive relation may be equivalently written @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the stress potential in the matrix and @xmath78 denotes the set of periodic stresses that are divergence - free in the unit cell , with prescribed average @xmath79 , and traction - free on the boundaries of the pores .",
    "it should be noted that the case of an isotropic matrix ( @xmath80 ) has been addressed by mcphedran and movchan ( 1994 ) in the more general framework of arbitrary contrast between the matrix and the square array of isotropic inclusions .",
    "hereafter only the strong anisotropy limits @xmath81 and @xmath82 , amenable to an exact solution , are considered . therefore : ( i ) when @xmath81 ( i.e. , @xmath83 or @xmath84 ) the medium is soft for ss loading , and resists ps loading ; ( ii ) when @xmath85 ( i.e. , @xmath86 or @xmath87 ) the medium is soft for ps loading , and resists ss loading .",
    "equibiaxial , ss and ps loading modes will be considered separately hereafter , so that only one of the three averaged components of the strain or stress is non - zero at a time .",
    "it is denoted by @xmath88 ( resp .",
    "@xmath89 ) . depending on the loading mode considered , strain and stress components and displacements",
    "enjoy various symmetry properties summarized in appendix [ sec : sym ] .    for clarity , we detail the correspondence between the loading modes and the anisotropy properties of the material .",
    "consider e.g. the limiting case @xmath90 , attained by two different types of materials : ( i ) @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( material 1 ) ; ( ii ) @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( material 2 ) .",
    "we seek solutions with strain and stress finite almost everywhere ( a.e . ) , i.e. , except on points or on lines in the plane .",

    "likewise @xmath97 is finite a.e .",
    ", so that @xmath98 a.e .  in material 1 .",
    "hence material 1 is infinitely soft in the ss direction and can be finitely loaded in the ps direction , whereas material 2 is infinitely rigid in the ps direction and can be finitely loaded only in the ss direction .",
    "similar considerations apply for @xmath85 , leading to the following correspondence :    @xmath81:ps loading @xmath99 @xmath83,ss loading @xmath99 @xmath84 , + @xmath85:ss loading @xmath99 @xmath87 , ps loading @xmath99 @xmath86 .    in equibiaxial loading , both types of materials should be considered for each of the limits @xmath81 or @xmath85 .",
    "as is well - known , the elasticity tensor ( [ eq : lmat ] ) is positive definite when @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath33 are all strictly positive , and we have existence and uniqueness of solutions . as mentioned above , however , the interest in this work is for the limiting cases where one of the eigenvalues of the elasticity tensor ( [ eq : lmat ] ) ( or , of its inverse , the compliance tensor ) tend to zero . for these cases , care must be exercised when interpreting the solutions . as will be seen below , the relevant potential energy , or complementary energy functionals can still be shown to be strictly convex in the subspace of allowable strains , or stresses , and the standard theorems ( see , for example , proposition 1.2 of ekeland and temam , 1974 ) would still ensure existence and uniqueness of the solutions . however , appropriate components of the strain ( or stress ) field can develop discontinuities in these limiting cases . in this connection",
    ", it is also relevant to note that the governing equations lose ellipticity , leading to hyperbolic behavior ( see below ) .",

    ", it should be kept in mind that the solutions of interest here are limiting cases of standard elasticity problems ( with positive - definite elasticity tensors ) for which solutions have been obtained by numerical methods ( willot et al . , 2007 ) .      making use of the constitutive relations ( [ eq : lambdamu ] ) ,",
