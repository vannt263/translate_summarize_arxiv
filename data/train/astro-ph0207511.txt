    "cosmological models predict the large scale matter distribution evolved from primordial fluctuations in the density of the universe .",
    "unfortunately this distribution is not directly accessible through observations because we can only observe the distributions of objects like galaxies or clusters of galaxies that do not , necessarily , trace the mass distribution in a simple way .",
    "the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution has proven to be the most popular statistic used to characterize the matter distribution in the universe .",
    "this is due to its tight relation to physical properties of the growth of structures throughout the history of the universe . also , the many ways and different kind of data that can be used to measure the power spectrum has allowed independent results from redshift and angular galaxy surveys , cluster surveys , and cmb fluctuations studies .",
    "each of these approaches have different drawbacks , though .",
    "for instance , the results from large redshift surveys , are subject to several problems since the results obtained are affected by the incompleteness of the survey , its geometry , the redshift space distortions and the bias factor ( which can be scale dependent ) .",
    "moreover the distribution of galaxies or clusters of galaxies is affected by non - linear evolution effects , which makes it even more difficult to carry out a direct comparison between observational results and theoretical model predictions .",
    "an alternative technique was presented by gaztaaga & baugh ( 1998 ) , and has been applied in different ways by several other authors ( dodelson & gastaaga , 2001 , eisenstein & zaldarriaga , 2001 and references therein ) . in it the power spectrum of the galaxy distribution is derived from the angular correlation function inverting limber s equation .",
    "as this procedure does not involve any fourier transforms nor the use of redshift data , the results obtained in this way are not affected by a convolution with the survey window function , nor by redshift space distortions .",
    "the principal uncertainty in this approach comes from the fact that one of the ingredients of the technique is the redshift distribution of galaxies , which may not be accurately known , and moreover the results are still affected by the bias factor and non - linear evolution .",
    "the aim of this work is to develop a new method for obtaining the power spectrum , free of the problems of the methods previously described .",
    "in order to do this , we use the formalisms of press & schechter ( 1974 , hereafter ps ) and sheth , mo & tormen ( 2001 , hereafter smt ) where halos form in the higher peaks of the evolving primordial density fluctuations which are related to the linear power spectrum .",
    "this indicates that studying the distribution of halo masses , one can obtain information about the mass distribution , and therefore , recover the mass power spectrum .",
    "more precisely , ps s like recipes are sets of equations that allow the determination of the mass function of dark matter halos from the mass power spectrum .",
    "if the mass function can be determined observationally , we can use these equations in the inverse way to derive the linear power spectrum .    in this paper",
    "we present a new method for determining the linear power spectrum from the mass function of clusters of galaxies based on the ps , smt and jenkins et al .",
    "( 2001 , hereafter j01 ) prescriptions for the mass function of systems expected in hierarchical clustering scenarios .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows , in section ",
    "2 we briefly review the different formalisms for obtaining a mass function used in this work . in ",
    "3 we give the general outline of our method and a simple test in an idealized case . in ",
    "4 we describe a test of our method by its application to the gif simulations ( kauffman et al . , 1999 ) . in ",
    "4 we show a comparison with the results obtained using the standard technique of feldman , kaiser & peacock ( 1994 , hereafter fkp ) for measuring the power spectrum , and finally , in  5 we present a short discussion and the main conclusions .",
    "an important tool with which to characterize the density field is the rms density fluctuation , smoothed on some comoving scale @xmath6 . for the case of a top - hat window , this scale is related to a mass @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mean density of the universe ( @xmath9 ) . in turn , this quantity and the power spectrum @xmath10 are related by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dimensionless power spectrum and @xmath13 is the fourier transform of the top - hat window function @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the spherical bessel function of order 1 .    = 8.truecm = 8.truecm    ps developed a simple formalism to obtain an analytical expression for the differential mass function of dark matter halos based on the spherical collapse model . in this model ,",

    "for an @xmath19 universe @xmath20 and its value has little dependence on cosmology ( eke et al . ,",
    "this function is plotted in figure 1 for a @xmath3cdm model .",
    "the vague analytical justification in the derivation of expression ( [ ps ] ) has lead to different criticisms of the ps formalism ( e.g. peacock & heavens , 1989 ) , but a later and more formal derivation due to bond et al .",
    "( 1991 ) based on a particular type of filtering , and the set excursion theory , yields the same expression for the mass function according to the spherical collapse model , placing the ps formalism on a more solid theoretical basis .",
    "in addition to the original tests presented in ps , equation ( [ ps ] ) has been checked against results from a variety of numerical simulations ( efstathiou et al . , 1988 , colberg & couchman , 1989 ) showing a good general agreement .",
    "nevertheless , recent works ( tormen , 1998 ; sheth & tormen , 1999 , governato et al .",
    "1999 , j01 ) detected discrepancies between the ps predictions and the halo abundances obtained in much better numerical simulations .",
    "the ps formula underestimates the abundances of massive halos and overestimates the low mass end of the mass function ( already seen in the earlier numerical simulations results ) .",
    "a better description of the numerical results is given by a correction to the ps mass function proposed originally by sheth & tormen ( 1999 )    @xmath21   \\label{smt } \\\\ & & \\times \\left| \\frac{d\\ln \\left ( \\sigma \\right ) } { d\\ln ( m)}\\right| e^{-\\left ( \\frac{a\\delta _ { c}^{2}}{2\\sigma ^{2}(m)}\\right)}{\\rm d}m\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "in this section we analyse the problem of recovering the power spectrum @xmath1 using equation ( [ sigmaydelta ] ) and the expressions for the mass function in the formalisms just described .",
    "the steps to be followed in obtaining the linear mass power spectrum are :    1 .   obtain the variance @xmath39 from the mass function . in order to do this",

    "we must ensure that the assumed formalism provides an accurate description of the underlying mass function .",

    "following dodelson & gaztaaga ( 1999 ) we will use greek index for quantities in @xmath5-space and latin for those in real - space .",

    "figure 8 shows that except for the high mass end , the effect of changing @xmath169 in the solutions of @xmath0 is simply a change in the overall normalization . on the other hand ,",
    "the shape of the solutions is affected in the high mass limit . as is shown below",
    ", this effect propagates into the power spectrum causing differences in the low @xmath5 end .",
    "figure 9 shows that the effect of changing the value of @xmath53 can be more serious , as the solutions obtained have different behaviors than that observed in the @xmath141 case .",
    "this will cause differences in the obtained power spectrum in all scales .    in order to analyze the effect of these variations on the power spectrum we use the lr technique to obtain @xmath1 from the @xmath0 functions plotted in figures 8 and 9 . in doing",
    "so we used the same value of @xmath127 used in  4.3 when obtaining the power spectrum from this simulation .",
    "the results obtained this way are plotted in figures 10 and 11 .",
    "figure 10 shows that , as we pointed out previously , the effect arising from changing the value of @xmath169 is important in the lower values of @xmath5 , where it can produce considerable changes in the solutions . for the higher values of @xmath5 , the solutions obtained are not very different for the one obtained for the correct value of @xmath169 .",
    "this is the same effect observed in the analysis of @xmath0 where we only found a renormalization and not a change in shape .    the most important effect on the power spectrum ,",
    "is that caused by the use of a wrong value of @xmath53 . as it can be seen in figure 11 ,",
    "the solutions obtained differ notably between them , and show different behavior in every scale .",
    "the reason for this is that the effect of changing @xmath53 in @xmath0 is not a simple renormalization , but a change in the slope of the solutions .",
    "this makes @xmath53 the most important parameter in the model .",
    "as a final test of our method we compare the outcomes of the method presented in this work , and that of fkp , as described in zandivarez , abadi & lambas ( 2001 ) .",
    "we applied both methods to the gif simulations and the results are plotted in figures 12 and 13 corresponding to the @xmath160cdm and @xmath3cdm models respectively , where we plot the power spectrum @xmath57 , output of the fkp technique , in logarithmic ( upper panel ) and linear scales ( lower panel ) . in order to compare these results we have arbitrarily normalized the power spectrum derived from the fkp technique to that of the linear mass power spectrum , which is the outcome of our method .",
    "= 8.truecm = 8.truecm    = 8.truecm = 8.truecm    by inspection to these figures , it is clear that fkp and our method yield similar results , showing the power and performance of our approach .",
    "we notice that the solutions for @xmath57 obtained from the mass function show a much better agreement with the power spectrum of the corresponding model than those obtained using the fkp technique .",
    "the range of validity of our solutions must be kept in mind , since the apparent good description of @xmath170 in the higher values of @xmath5 correspond to the region where lr gives a constant solution for @xmath171 , which in turn gives @xmath172 , the approximate behavior of the power spectrum in these scales .",
    "even though lr gives a more accurate description of @xmath57 in the range where it has been proven to be applicable , the estimated power spectrum using the fkp technique works for higher values of @xmath5 . as the range of validity of our solution depends on the mass range of the differential mass function , the inclusion of low clusters masses will improve this situation .    as it can be seen in the lower panels of figures 12 and 13",
    ", the solution obtained by the use of lr gives a very accurate description of the power spectrum for the lower values of @xmath5 , where the fkp method fails to give a satisfactory answer .",
    "besides , the logarithmic bins in lr solution s sample these values of @xmath5 in a better way than the linear bins of the fkp technique , showing that our method is better in studying the power spectrum at these scales .",
    "it is important to stress the fact that our method provides the linear power spectrum , while the solution of the fkp technique is affected by nonlinear effects . these are not important in the range of scales analyzed here , but this may be significant when objects of lower masses are included in the analysis .",
    "a significant and important difference in our technique is that it naturally allows the use of information from different scales and objects , ranging from poor to rich clusters of galaxies in an homogeneous way .",
    "on the other hand the fkp technique will give different results for subsets of systems of galaxies with diferent masses , reflecting their relative bias with respect to the underlying mass distribution .",
    "furthermore , in our method it is desirable the inclusion of objects with a very broad range of masses , since this allows for a better determination of the power spectrum over a wider range of scales .",
    "in this work we have developed a new method to determine the linear mass power spectrum from the mass function of galaxy clusters based on the ps , smt and j01 formalisms .",
    "the rms fluctuation of mass @xmath0 is determined using the expression for the mass function in the form of a differential equation .",
    "we then use different techniques from integral equations theory to obtain the dimensionless power spectrum @xmath1 from @xmath0 .",
    "the implementation of this method to the gif @xmath3cdm and @xmath4cdm simulations shows a high efficiency in recovering the correct shape and amplitude of the power spectrum in a wide range of scales , showing a high performance and real practical utility .",
    "although the different solutions for @xmath0 , obtained from the simulations , show an overall agreement , it is clear that the j01 prescription gives a much better result than the ps or smt formalism , showing that the j01 general fit gives an excellent description of the differential mass function of clusters identified in the simulations .",
    "in the theoretical case analyzed in  3.2 the best solution was that obtained from the implementation of svd , which recovers the power spectrum in a wide range of scales .",
    "however , from the analysis of the results obtained from the simulations we conclude that the best technique to invert the integral equation in our problem is linear regularization .",
    "this situation can change with the use of the full covariance matrix and so , it must be analyzed without the assumption of a diagonal @xmath92 .",
    "the comparison of the results obtained with our method with those obtained by the standard fkp technique , shows a very good general agreement .",
    "nevertheless , in the scales of validity of our solutions , our answer gives a much more accurate description of the power spectrum than the ones obtained by the use of the fkp method .",
    "this is specially valid in the lower values of @xmath5 where the fkp solution fails to give the correct answer .",
    "further more , the logarithmic bins of our method sample these scales in a more efficient way than linear bins ( as is the case in the fkp output ) .",
    "this produces important effects in the analysis of the power spectrum in large scales .",
    "the fkp technique works for higher values of @xmath5 than the lr solution .",
    "however , this can improve significantly if information of @xmath37 for lower masses is included in the analysis .",
    "in order to apply our procedure to real data we need an estimate of the mass function of galaxy clusters . unfortunately , present estimates of this important statistical measure are not completely satisfactory since quoted values are significantly different and moreover they are referred to different cluster mass definitions ( see for instance bahcall & cen , 1993 ; biviano et al . , 1993 ;",
    "girardi et al . , 1998 ; girardi & giuricin , 2000 ; reiprich & bhringer , 2001 ; bahcall et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "as we have already pointed out , even in the case where errors in the individual masses are large , the overall effect in the mass function is not important when compared to other sources of uncertainties such as the use of different mass definitions .",
    "different methods for cluster mass estimates ( i.e. optical , x - ray , gravitational lensing ) are clearly correlated , but provide different values for the mass of the same cluster .",
    "furthermore , it is not clear how these mass definitions are related to the ones used in numerical simulations ( i.e. fof @xmath35 , fof @xmath173 , so @xmath174 , etc . ) which also show differences among them ( see white , 2001 ) .",
    "this is of extreme importance and is the principal source of uncertainties in our method . given that observational cluster masses are estimated using one of the methods mentioned above , it may be incorrect to assume a fit to the mass function whose coefficients have been determined using fof masses , such as the j01 formalism .",
    "this indicates that the use of expressions derived from theoretical formalisms in the analysis of observational data ( a common practice in the literature ) must not be made without a careful analysis of the relationship between the different mass definitions involved .",
    "there are other statistics available in the literature , such as the temperature function ( henry & arnaud , 1991 , markevitch , 1998 , blanchard et al . , 2000 ;",
    "ikebe et al , 2001 ) of x - ray samples .",
    "the high correlation between temperature and mass suggested by numerical simulations ( evrard , 1990 ; evrard , metzler & navarro , 1996 ; yoshikawa & suto , 2000 , mathiesen & evrard , 2001 ) , has lead many authors to use temperature functions in confronting observations with theoretical predictions , instead of mass functions .    the method described here",
    "can equally be applied to the temperature function of galaxy clusters , but , in doing so , we need a reliable mass - temperature relation . unfortunately this transformation has not been yet determined in an accurate way , and different @xmath175 relations give equally different results between them . the observational determination of the mass function of galaxy clusters can improve in the next few years with the outcome of new mass estimates from gravitational lenses , or even from virial mass estimates obtained from the new large catalogs that will be soon available such as 2df and sdss .    if the above discussion is properly addressed the methods described in this work can be very useful tools to provide new and reliable determinations of the linear mass power spectrum .",
    "we would like to thank carlthon baugh for reading the manuscript and his helpful comments and ariel zandivarez for providing us the calculations of the fkp power spectrum . we also want to thank the referee fabio governato for his constructive suggestions .",
