    "the notion of building sets and nested sets , which constitutes the defining combinatorics of arrangement models , has its roots in the fulton - macpherson construction for configuration spaces , hence is inspired by the combinatorics of  @xmath48 .",
    "looking along the time line in the other direction , de  concini - procesi arrangement models have triggered a number of more general constructions with similar spirit : compactifications of conically stratified complex manifolds by macpherson and procesi  @xcite , and model constructions for mixed real subspace and halfspace arrangements and real stratified manifolds by gaiffi  @xcite that use spherical rather than classical blowups .",
    "as a first impact , the de  concini - procesi model construction has yielded substantial progress on a longstanding open question in arrangement theory  ( * ? ? ?",

    "_  @xcite .",

    "a key step in the description of the morgan model is the presentation of cohomology of divisor components and their intersections in purely combinatorial terms  @xcite . for details on this approach to arrangement cohomology ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the morgan model is fairly complicated even for small arrangements , and the approach is bound to rational coefficients .",
