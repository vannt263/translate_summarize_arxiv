    "the momentum distribution ( md ) is of interest in many research subjects of modern physics , including those referring to helium , electronic , nuclear , and quark systems @xcite . in the last two decades",
    ", there has been significant effort for the determination of the md in nuclear matter and finite nucleon systems .",
    "md is related to the cross sections of various kinds of nuclear reactions .",
    "specifically , the interaction of particles with nuclei at high energies , such as ( p,2p ) , ( e , e@xmath14p ) , and ( e , e@xmath14 ) reactions , the nuclear photo - effect , meson absorption by nuclei , the inclusive proton production in proton - nucleus collisions , and even phenomena at low energies such as giant multipole resonances , give significant information about the nucleon md .",
    "the experimental evidence obtained from inclusive and exclusive electron scattering on nuclei established the existence of a high - momentum component for momenta @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , in principle , mean field theories can not describe correctly md and density distribution simultaneously @xcite and the main features of md depend little on the effective mean field considered @xcite .",
    "the reason is that md is sensitive to short - range and tensor nucleon - nucleon correlations which are not included in the mean field theories .",
    "thus , theoretical approaches , which take into account short range correlations ( src ) due to the character of the nucleon - nucleon forces at small distances , are necessary to be developed .",
    "zabolitzky and ey @xcite , employing the coupled - cluster ( or @xmath16 ) method for the microscopic evaluation of nuclear md for the ground states of @xmath17he and @xmath18o and using various realistic nn - potentials , showed that the contribution of correlations dominates for momenta beyond @xmath19 .",
    "a realistic interaction and a many - body approach have been used by benhar et al @xcite for the evaluation of md of @xmath20c , @xmath18o and @xmath21ca .",
    "their results have yielded a much larger content of the high momentum component with respect to the results obtained within the hartree - fock approach or within methods which take into account the effect of correlations phenomenologically .",
    "bohigas and stringari @xcite and dal ri et al @xcite evaluated the effect of src s on the one- and two- body densities by developing a low order approximation ( loa ) in the framework of jastrow formalism .",
    "they showed that one - body quantities provide an adequate test for the presence of src s in nuclei , which indicates that the independent - particle wave functions can not reproduce simultaneously the form factor and the md of a correlated system and also the effect of src s strongly modify the md by introducing an important contribution in the region @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "stoitsov et al @xcite generalised the model of jastrow correlations within the loa of ref .",
    "@xcite , to heavier nuclei as @xmath18o , @xmath24ar , @xmath21ca .",
    "their analytical expressions for the md show the high momentum tail .",
    "they found that there is an a dependence of md for small values of @xmath8 , while for large values of @xmath8 the slope of @xmath25 versus @xmath8 is roughly the same for the above three nuclei as well as for @xmath26he .",
    "the same behaviour of the md of protons and neutrons for the @xmath27 nuclei has been found earlier by schiavilla et al @xcite performing variational calculations with realistic interactions .",
    "md for the nuclei @xmath17he , @xmath18o and @xmath21ca was also calculated by traini and orlandini @xcite within a phenomenological model in which dynamical short - range and tensor correlations effects were included .",
    "they showed that src increase the high momentum component considerably while the tensor correlations do not affect the md appreciably @xcite . in heavy nuclei ,",
    "the local density approximation was used @xcite for the study of the effect of src s in md and the predictions were in agreement with the results of microscopic calculations in nuclear matter and in light nuclei .",
    "the influence of src s on the md of nucleons in nuclei has also been evaluated by mther et al @xcite within the green - function approach assuming a realistic meson - exchange potential for the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "their analysis on @xmath18o demonstrates that a non - negligible contribution to the md should be found in partial waves which are unoccupied in the simple shell model .",
    "another approach is to consider the average occupancy of the relevant shell - model orbitals @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the depletion of such orbitals can be of the order @xmath28 or more for single - particles ( sp ) states below the fermi energy @xcite .",
    "in the various approaches , the md of the closed shell nuclei @xmath17he , @xmath18o and @xmath21ca as well as of @xmath29pb and nuclear matter is usually studied .",
    "there is no systematic study of the one body density matrix ( obdm ) and md which include both the case of closed and open shell nuclei .",
    "this would be helpful in the calculations of the overlap integrals and reactions in that region of nuclei if one wants to go beyond the mean field theories @xcite .",
    "for that reason , in the present work , we attempt to find some general expressions for the obdm @xmath30 and md @xmath6 which could be used both for closed and open shell nuclei .",
    "this work is a continuation of our previous study @xcite on the form factors and densities of the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 shell nuclei .",
    "the expression of @xmath30 was found , first , using the factor cluster expansion of clark and co - workers @xcite and jastrow correlation function which introduces src for closed shell nuclei and then was extrapolated to the case of @xmath3 open shell nuclei .",
    "@xmath6 was found by fourier transform of @xmath30 .",
    "these expressions are functionals of the harmonic oscillator ( ho ) orbitals and depend on the ho parameter @xmath4 and the correlation parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath4 and @xmath5 , which we have used for the closed shell nuclei @xmath26he , @xmath18o and @xmath21ca , are the ones which have been determined in ref .",
    "@xcite by fit of the theoretical @xmath31 , derived with the same cluster expansion , to the experimental one . for the open shell nuclei @xmath20c , @xmath9 mg , @xmath10si and @xmath11s we provide new values for these parameters , which have been found to give a better fit to the experimental form factors than in our previous analysis @xcite .",
    "it is found that the high - momentum tail of the md of all the nuclei we have considered appears for @xmath32 and also there is an a dependence of the values of @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "this @xmath7 dependence of md was first investigated considering @xmath9 mg , @xmath10si and @xmath11s as @xmath12 shell nuclei .",
    "next we treated the above nuclei as @xmath12-@xmath13 shell nuclei having the occupation probability of the @xmath13 state as an extra free parameter in the fit of the form factors .",
    "the @xmath7 dependence is quite small in the second case .",

    "there is an increase of the above values by the increasing of mass number .",
    "in the present work , general expressions for the correlated obdm and md have been found using the factor cluster expansion of clark and co - workers .",

    "the analytical expressions of the obdm , md and mean kinetic energy for the @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 shell nuclei , which have been found , are functions of the ho parameter @xmath4 , the correlation parameter @xmath5 and the occupation probabilities of the various states .",
    "these expressions are suitable for the systematic study of the above quantities for the @xmath3 , @xmath0-@xmath1 and @xmath0-@xmath2 shell nuclei and also for the study of the dependence of these quantities on the various parameters .",
    "it is found that , while the general structure of the md at high momenta is almost the same for all the nuclei we have considered , in agreement with other studies , there is an @xmath7 dependence on @xmath33 both at small values of @xmath8 and the high momentum component .",
