    "around 1770 d. bernoulli studied a model for the exchange of heat between two bodies .",
    "this model can also be seen as a description of the diffusion of a pair of incompressible gases between two containers .",
    "this model was independently analyzed by s. laplace around 1810 , see the references in @xcite .",
    "another model of similar characteristics was introduced by p. and t. ehrenfest in 1907 in connection with the controversies surrounding the work of l. boltzmann in the kinetic theory of gases dealing with reversibility and convergence to equilibrium .",
    "boltzmann had apparentlly deduced his h - theorem dictating convergence to equilibrium starting from the time reversible equations of newton .",
    "for a nice account of this see @xcite .",
    "both of these models are instances of discrete time markov chains with fairly explicit tridiagonal one - step transition probability matrices which are obtained by considering carefully the underlying stochastic mechanism that connects the state of the system at two consecutive values of time .",
    "the second model features two urns , i and ii , that share a total of n balls .",
    "the state of the system at time @xmath4 is the number of balls in urn i. each ball has a different label from the set @xmath5 . at time @xmath4 a number @xmath6 in the set @xmath5 is chosen with equal probabilities and the ball with this label is moved from the urn where it sits to the other urn .",
    "this gives the state of the system at time @xmath7 .",
    "writing down the one - step transition probability matrix is now a matter of counting carefully .",
    "while it had been possible to obtain interesting answers for these two models for quite some time , it is only much more recently that some very nice connections have been noticed between these models and some basic sets of discrete orthogonal polynomials , namely the krawtchouk and the dual hahn polynomials .",
    "moreover although there are many ways of arriving at these polynomials it is relevant to mention here that they can be realized as the  spherical functions \" for certain finite bihomogeneous spaces .",
    "a very good reference for this material is @xcite .",
    "we stress the remarkable fact that these two models of old vintage and clear physical significance can be solved in terms of the simplest of all hypergeometric functions , namely @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "as many readers certainly know many of the classical special functions of mathematical physics , such as the legendre , the hermite and the laguerre polynomials , could have been obtained for the first time as spherical functions for certain symmetric spaces .",
    "a good basic reference here is @xcite .",
    "the way that things developed historically is , of course , completely different .",
    "the interplay between important physical problems and certain tools that arise naturally in group representation theory constitutes the theme of this paper .",
    "the situation described here is the reverse of what has been discussed above for the bernoulli - laplace and the ehrenfest models : we will go from group representation theory to some concrete models that might be of some physical interest .",
    "we will start from a matrix that is obtained from group representation theory and try to build a model that goes along with it .",
    "the models constructed here are certainly not the only possible ones .",
    "more natural ones might be lurking around .    in a series of papers including @xcite one considers matrix valued spherical functions associated to a pair @xmath10 arriving at sequences of matrix valued polynomials of one real variable satisfying a three term recursion relation whose semi - infinite block tridiagonal matrix is stochastic , i.e. the entries are non - negative and the sum of the elements in any row is @xmath11 .",
    "this matrix depends on a number of free parameters that have a very definite group theoretical meaning .",
    "the important point is that the tools developed in the papers just mentioned allow one to give explicit expressions , in terms of some definite integrals , of all the entries of any power of the original matrix .",
    "this means that if one could think of a nice markov chain with this matrix as its one - step transition probability matrix one would have an explicit form for the entries of the @xmath4-step transition probability matrix .",
    "many readers will recognize that this is exactly what s. karlin and j. mcgregor , see @xcite , proposed as a way of exploiting orthogonal polynomials and the role they play in the spectral analysis of certain finite or semi - infinite tridiagonal matrices .",
    "the method advocated in @xcite starts with a so called birth - and - death process whose one - step tridiagonal transition matrix is easily constructed from the given model and one has to look for the corresponding spectral information : the eigenfunctions and the spectral measure .",
    "here we travel this road in the opposite direction in a more elaborate set - up .    the relation between matrix valued orthogonal polynomials , block tridiagonal matrices and quasi - birth and death processes has been first exploited independently in @xcite as well as in later papers by these authors",
    ".    we will consider several random walks whose configuration spaces are subsets of @xmath12 , the so call @xmath13-spherical dual of @xmath1 , and whose one - step transition matrices come from the stochastic matrix that appears in @xcite and @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the dual of @xmath1 is the set @xmath14 of all equivalence classes of finite dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath1 .",
    "these equivalence classes are parametrized by the @xmath7-tuples of integers @xmath15 subject to the conditions @xmath16 .    if @xmath17 , the @xmath13-spherical dual of @xmath1 is the subset @xmath12 of @xmath14 of the representations of @xmath1 whose restriction to @xmath2 contains the representation @xmath13 .",
    "then it is well known , see",
    "@xcite , that @xmath12 corresponds to the set of all @xmath18 s as above that satisfy the extra constraints @xmath19    in other words @xmath12 can be visualized as the subset of all points @xmath18 of the integral lattice @xmath20 in the set @xmath21\\times\\cdots\\times[k_{n-1},k_n]\\times(-\\infty , k_n].\\ ] ] an example is given in the figure below .",
    ", @xmath22,@xmath23.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    we can now state more precisely the point of this paper : starting from the stochastic matrix @xmath24 that appears in @xcite and @xcite , we describe a random mechanism that gives rise to a markov chain whose state space is the subset of @xmath12 of all @xmath25 such that @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) , and whose one - step transition matrix coincides with the one we started from .",
    "the construction in @xcite and @xcite deals with the case of @xmath29 but in @xcite and @xcite this was extended to the case of @xmath30 .",
    "one step of the markov evolution will consist of two substeps taken in succesion . in the first substep one of the values of @xmath31 increases by one , subject to the constraints ( 1 ) . in the second substep one of the new values of our @xmath31 s decreases by one ,",
    "again this is subject to the same constraints .",
    "thus from the configuration @xmath18 one could for instance go to @xmath32 or one could stay put at @xmath18 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath33 for the vector with its @xmath34th component equal to @xmath11 and all the others equal to @xmath35 .",
    "any state has a total of at most @xmath36 positions where it can move in one complete step of our process consisting of two simpler steps .",
    "keep in mind that the two succesive simpler steps can end up with our random walker in the initial state .",
    "we will analyze in detail the simpler substeps that constitute one full step of our process .",
    "this will take up most of the analysis in the next sections .",
    "we now describe the contents of the paper .",
    "in section [ esfericas ] we collect the necessary material to state and explain a three term recursion relation ( with matrix coefficients ) for a sequence of matrix valued orthogonal polynomials , built up from irreducible spherical functions of a fixed type associated to the pair @xmath37 .",
    "this should help the reader make the connection between @xcite and the present paper .    in section [ factorizacion ]",
    "we construct a factorization of the stochastic matrix that define the three term recursion relation for the sequence of matrix valued orthogonal polynomials given in the previous section .",
    "this factorization into two stochastic matrices leads to the two substeps mentioned above .",
    "before starting the analysis of our general urn model in section [ urnmodelun ] for one of the substeps , we describe in detail in section [ urnmodelu3 ] an urn model for @xmath38 .",
    "the definition of the stochastic matrix @xmath24 alluded above , as well as its factorization make sense for any @xmath25 .",
    "to each configuration @xmath39 of @xmath4 integer numbers we associate its young diagram , a combinatorial object which has @xmath40 boxes in the first row , @xmath41 boxes in the second row , and so on down to the last row which has @xmath42 boxes .",
    "for example the young diagram associated to the configuration @xmath43 is    @xmath44{}&\\makebox[1.5 mm ] { } & \\makebox[1.5mm]{}&\\makebox[1.5mm]{}&\\makebox[1.5mm]{}&\\makebox[1.5mm]{}\\\\ \\hline",

    "they provide a convenient way to describe the group representations of the symmetric and general linear groups and to study their properties .",
    "in particular young diagrams are in one - to - one correspondence with the irreducible representations of the symmetric group over the complex numbers and the irreducible polynomial representations of the general linear groups .",
    "they were introduced by alfred young in 1900 .",
    "they were then applied to the study of the symmetric group by georg frobenius in 1903 . their theory and applications",
    "were further developed by many mathematicians and there are numerous and interesting applications , beyond representation theory , in combinatorics and algebraic geometry .",
    "if we consider the subset all @xmath25 such that @xmath45 it is natural to represent such a state of our markov chain by its young diagram , see section [ young ]",
    ". then in the last two sections we describe a random mechanism based on young diagrams that gives rise to a random walk in the set of all young diagrams of @xmath46 rows and whose @xmath47 row has @xmath48 boxes @xmath49 , and whose transition matrix is @xmath50 , see .",
