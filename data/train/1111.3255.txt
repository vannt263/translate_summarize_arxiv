    "it is commonly believed that gluon - gluon fusion is the dominant mechanism of @xmath2 or @xmath3 production at high energies .",
    "then in leading - order ( lo ) approximation the differential cross section for the single - parton scattering ( sps ) production of heavy quark and heavy antiquark pair reads : @xmath4 where longitudinal momentum fractions can be calculated from kinematical variables of final quark and antiquark as : @xmath5 , @xmath6 with @xmath7 s being quark ( antiquark ) rapidities and @xmath8 being a quark ( antiquark ) transverse mass .",
    "we have limited here to gluon - gluon fusion only which is the dominant mechanism at high energies .",
    "the quark - antiquark annihilation plays some role only close to the kinematical threshold and/or large rapidities . in general ,",
    "the higher - order corrections do not change most of observables leading to a rough renormalization of the cross section by the so - called @xmath9 factor .    in the present paper we wish to estimate the contribution of double - parton scatterings ( dps ) .",
    "the mechanism of double - parton scattering production of two pairs of heavy quark and heavy antiquark is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .    the double - parton scattering has been recognized and discussed already in seventies and eighties @xcite .",
    "the activity stopped when it was realized that their contribution at those times available center - of - mass energies was negligible .",
    "several estimates of the cross section for different processes have been presented in recent years @xcite .",
    "the theory of the double - parton scattering is quickly developing ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the present analysis we wish to concentrate on the production of @xmath10 four - parton final state which has not been carefully discussed so far , but , as will be shown here , is particularly interesting especially in the context of experiments being carried out at lhc and/or high - energy atmospheric and cosmogenic neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) .",
    "the double - parton scattering formalism proposed so far assumes two single - parton scatterings .",
    "then in a simple probabilistic picture the cross section for double - parton scattering can be written as : @xmath11 this formula assumes that the two subprocesses are not correlated and do not interfere . at low energies",
    "one has to include parton momentum conservation i.e. extra limitations : @xmath12 1 and @xmath13 1 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are longitudinal momentum fractions of gluons emitted from one proton and @xmath16 and @xmath17 their counterpairs for gluons emitted from the second proton .",
    "the `` second '' emission must take into account that some momentum was used up in the first parton collision .",
    "this effect is important at large quark or antiquark rapidities .",
    "experimental data @xcite provide an estimate of @xmath18 in the denominator of formula ( [ basic_formula ] ) . in our analysis we take a rather conservative value @xmath18 = 15 mb .",
    "production via double - parton scattering . , scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the simple formula ( [ basic_formula ] ) can be generalized to include differential distributions . again in leading - order approximation differential distribution can be written as @xmath19 which by construction reproduces formula for integrated cross section ( [ basic_formula ] ) .",
    "this cross section is formally differential in 8 dimensions but can be easily reduced to 7 dimensions noting that physics of unpolarized scattering can not depend on azimuthal angle of the pair or on azimuthal angle of one of the produced @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) quark ( antiquark ) .",
    "the differential distributions for each single scattering step can be written in terms of collinear gluon distributions with longitudinal momentum fractions @xmath14 , @xmath16 , @xmath15 and @xmath17 expressed in terms of rapidities @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and transverse momenta of quark ( or antiquark ) for each step ( in the lo approximation identical for quark and antiquark ) .",
    "a more general formula for the cross section can be written formally in terms of double - parton distributions , e.g. @xmath24 , @xmath25 , etc . in the case of heavy quark ( antiquark ) production at high energies :",
    "@xmath26 it is physically motivated to write the double - parton distributions rather in the impact parameter space @xmath27 , where @xmath28 are usual conventional parton distributions and @xmath29 is an overlap of the matter distribution in the transverse plane where @xmath30 is a distance between both gluons in the transverse plane @xcite .",
    "the effective cross section in ( [ basic_formula ] ) is then @xmath31 and in this approximation is energy independent .",
    "the double - parton distributions in eq.([cs_via_doublepdfs ] ) are generally unknown .",
    "usually one assumes a factorized form and expresses them via standard distributions for sps .",
    "even if factorization is valid at some scale , qcd evolution may lead to a factorization breaking .",
    "evolution is known only in the case when the scale of both scatterings is the same @xcite i.e. for heavy object , like double gauge boson production . for double @xmath0 production",
    "this is not the case and was not discussed so far in the literature . in the present preliminary study",
    "we shall therefore apply the commonly used in the literature factorized model .",
    "a refinement will be done elsewhere . in explicit calculations presented below",
    "we use leading order collinear gluon distributions ( grv94 @xcite , cteq6 @xcite , gjr08 @xcite , mstw08 @xcite ) .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : single_vs_double_lo ] we compare cross sections for the single and double - parton scattering as a function of proton - proton center - of - mass energy . at low energies the conventional single - parton scattering dominates . for reference",
    "we show the proton - proton total cross section as a function of energy as parametrizes in ref .  @xcite . at low energy",
    "the @xmath0 or @xmath32 cross sections are much smaller than the total cross section . at higher energies",
    "the contributions dangerously approach the expected total cross section .",
    "this shows that inclusion of unitarity effect and/or saturation of parton distributions may be necessary .",
    "the effect of saturation in @xmath33 production has been included e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite but not checked versus experimental data .",
    "presence of double - parton scattering changes the situation .",
    "the double - parton scattering is therefore potentially very important ingredient in the context of high energy neutrino production in the atmosphere @xcite or of cosmogenic origin @xcite .",
    "we leave this rather difficult issue for future studies where the lhc charm data must be included . at lhc energies",
    "the cross section for both terms become comparable or @xmath3 was shown the cross section should be multiplied by a factor of two  two @xmath2 or two @xmath3 in each event . ] .",
    "this is a completely new situation when the double - parton scattering gives a huge contribution to inclusive charm production .        in figs .",
    "[ fig : double_single1 ] , [ fig : double_single2 ] , we present single @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) distributions . within approximations made in this paper the distributions are identical in shape to single - parton scattering distributions .",
    "this means that double - scattering contribution produces naturally an extra center - of - mass energy dependent @xmath9 factor to be contrasted with approximately energy - independent @xmath9-factor due to next - to - leading order corrections .",
    "one can see a strong dependence on the factorization and renormalization scales which produces almost order - of - magnitude uncertainties and precludes a more precise estimation .",
    "a better estimate could be done when lhc charm data are published and the theoretical distributions are somewhat adjusted to experimental data .",
    "so far we have discussed only single particle spectra of @xmath2 or @xmath3 ( rapidity , transverse momentum distributions ) which due to scale dependence do not provide a clear test of the existence of double - parton scattering contributions .",
    "a more stringent test could be performed by studying correlation observables . in particular , correlations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 are very interesting even without double - parton scattering terms @xcite . in fig .  [",
    "fig : double_correlations_1 ] we show distribution in the difference of @xmath2 and @xmath3 rapidities @xmath35 ( left panel ) as well as in the @xmath0 invariant mass @xmath36 ( right panel ) .",
    "we show both terms : when @xmath0 are emitted in the same parton scattering ( @xmath37 or @xmath38 ) and when they are emitted from different parton scatterings ( @xmath39 or @xmath40 ) . in the latter case",
    "we observe a long tail for large rapidity difference as well as at large invariant masses of @xmath0 .",
    "such distributions can not be directly measured for @xmath0 but could be measured for mesons ( rapidity difference up to 5 for the main atlas or cms detector ) or electron - positron or @xmath41 .",
    "the alice forward muon spectrometer @xcite covers the pseudorapidity interval 2.5 @xmath42 4 which when combined with the central detector means pseudorapidities differences up to 5 .",
    "this is expected to be a region of phase space where double - parton scattering contribution would most probably dominate over single - parton scattering contribution .",
    "this will be a topic of a forthcoming analysis .",
    "next - to - leading order corrections are not expected to give major contribution at large pseudorapidity differences or / and large invariant masses of @xmath41 but this must be verified in the future . the cms detector is devoted especially to measurements of muons .",
    "the lower transverse momentum threshold is however rather high , the smallest being about 1.5 gev at @xmath43 ( 2 - 2.4 ) which may be interesting for double - parton scattering searches .",
    "this requires special dedicated monte carlo studies .        finally in fig .",
    "[ fig : double_correlations_2 ] we present distribution in the transverse momentum of the @xmath0 pair @xmath44 , where @xmath45 which is a dirac delta function in the leading - order approximation .",
    "in contrast , double - parton scattering mechanism provide a broad distribution extending to large transverse momenta .",
    "next - to - leading order corrections obviously destroy the @xmath46-like leading - order correlation .",
    "we believe that similar distributions for @xmath47 or / and @xmath48 or @xmath41 pairs would be a useful observables to identify the dps contributions but this requires real monte carlo simultions including actual limitations of experimental apparatus .",
    "correlations between outgoing nonphotonic electrons has been studied at much lower rhic energy in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "production of two @xmath0 pairs in the leading order approximation is only a first step in trying to identify dps contribution . in the next step",
    "we plan next - to - leading order calculation of the same process .",
    "inclusion of hadronization and/or semileptonic decays would be very useful in planning experimental searches ."
