    "in many physical phenomena percolation effects play an important role @xcite . particularly , some dilute magnets are well described , in what concerns magnetic phase transitions , by uncorrelated diluted models @xcite . in these models , magnetic sites on a lattice are randomly replaced by non - magnetic ones , and a bond links each pair of occupied ( magnetic ) first neighbours . at zero temperature ,",
    "the problem is purely geometrical and is described in the following way .",
    "sites on a lattice are randomly occupied with probability @xmath1 , while all bonds are considered to be present .",
    "a cluster is then defined as a collection of present sites which are connected to each other through steps between occupied first - neighbours . as @xmath1 increases",
    ", an infinite cluster appears for the first time at a critical probability @xmath12 , which is lattice dependent . in analogy with thermal critical phenomena , some quantities are singular at the critical point , following a power - law behavior near @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "typical examples are the probability @xmath13 that a site belongs to the infinite cluster , which behaves as @xmath14 near @xmath4 , and the correlation length @xmath15 , which diverges at @xmath4 , according to @xmath16 .    nevertheless , some systems were found to be better described by _ correlated _ percolation models , where the presence of sites ( or bonds ) depends also on their neighbourhood .",
    "typical examples of correlated percolation models are bootstrap percolation @xcite and site - bond correlated percolation @xcite .",
    "the physical motivation for the introduction of the former model comes from diluted magnetic systems where competition between exchange ( which favour a magnetic ground state ) and crystal - field ( which leads to a non - magnetic ground state ) interactions takes place . to mimic this competition at zero temperature , the bootstrap percolation model was introduced @xcite : in this model , sites on a lattice are randomly occupied with probability @xmath1 but only those with",
    "at least @xmath3 occupied first - neighbours remain occupied . in the stable final configuration ,",
    "all occupied sites have at least @xmath3 occupied first - neighbours or the whole lattice is empty . as our purpose in this paper is to study one implementation of the bootstrap percolation model , we briefly review some of its properties in what follows ( for a thourough discussion of the results up to 1990 , see reference @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath7 case regains the usual ( uncorrelated ) site percolation model , where the transition is continuous and @xmath17 in two and three dimensions .",
    "more specifically , the most precise evaluations of the critical exponents for three - dimensional lattices are @xmath18 and @xmath19 from simulation @xcite and @xmath20 and @xmath21 from series @xcite . in the @xmath22 case ,",
    "only isolated sites are removed by the culling process : these sites do not contribute to the critical behaviour and @xmath4 and all critical exponents remain the same as for usual percolation .",
    "for @xmath23 , on the other hand , isolated clusters with two sites are eliminated , as well as some dangling structures of more compact clusters .",
    "the elimination of these dangling structures , however , does not break the infinite cluster ( whenever present ) and , therefore , the critical probability is the same as for usual percolation .",
    "moreover , as the exponent @xmath24 is also connected to the formation of this infinite cluster , its value is the same for @xmath23 and @xmath7 . in what concerns `` field ''",
    "exponents ( @xmath25 , for instance ) , previous results for two - dimensional systems indicate a higher value of this exponent for @xmath23 than for usual percolation @xcite . nevertheless , it has been shown later , through simulations on bigger lattices in two dimensions @xcite and general arguments applied to both two and three dimensions @xcite , that the exponent @xmath25 is the same for uncorrelated and @xmath23 bootstrap percolation models .",
    "let us now turn our atention to higher values of @xmath3 .",
    "it is generally believed that , for any value of @xmath3 where only infinite clusters can survive the culling process , @xmath26 .",
    "this is indeed the case for @xmath27 on hypercubic lattices ( @xmath28 is the dimension of the lattice ) @xcite , for @xmath29 on cubic @xcite and triangular @xcite lattices and for @xmath30 on the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that , for these cases , the usual finite - size scaling relation does not hold .",
    "this finite - size scaling predicts that , if a suitable definition of a finite - lattice `` critical '' point , @xmath31 , is made , this point will approach the critical point in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath4 , as : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the linear size of the finite system , such that @xmath34 , and @xmath24 is the usual critical exponent .",
    "this finite - size behaviour is indeed observed for @xmath35 , but fails for high values of @xmath3 . for @xmath27 on hypercubic lattices , it has been proven that @xmath36 @xcite , e.g. , proportional to @xmath37 for @xmath38 dimensions . also for @xmath29 on the cubic lattice",
    ", the correct finite - size behaviour is @xmath39 , with @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "these results for high @xmath3 have been conjectured or tested in numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "the results stated in the previous paragraphs do not apply to the @xmath0 case on the cubic lattice . for this model ,",
    "one expects @xmath4 to be above the value for uncorrelated percolation ( where @xmath40 @xcite ) , since the infinite cluster for usual percolation at @xmath4 is not stable with respect to the culling process for @xmath0 . on the other hand , since finite clusters are still stable for this value of @xmath3 on the cubic lattice , it is expected that @xmath41 .",
    "numerical simulations confirmed this scenario @xcite , although the relative small sizes used in those works indicate that the values might not be precise ( we will return to this point later ) . in what concerns the critical exponents ,",
    "previous results indicate that the exponent @xmath24 is the same as for usual percolation @xcite but @xmath25 is higher than its uncorrelated counterpart @xcite .",
    "however , in neither of these works a extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit is attempted , leaving the possibility that finite - size effects might be the reason for the discrepancy in the values of @xmath25 .",
    "this possibility was first proven to be right , in the context of two - dimensional bootstrap percolation models , in references @xcite and later confirmed for @xmath0 on the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a new universality class for bootsrap percolation with @xmath0 on the cubic lattice is the problem we address in this work .",
    "we resort to numerical simulation methods , which , together with finite - size scaling analysis , allowed us to obtain more precise values for the critical parameters .",
    "we also study the so - called critical spanning probability , i.e. , the probability that a given lattice has a cluster connecting its boundaries at criticality @xcite .",
    "this quantity shows some degree of universality : it depends on the dimension and shape of the system and on the specific boundary condition but not on the lattice type ( simple cubic of f.c.c .",
    ", for instance ) and on the particular kind of percolation ( site or bond ) @xcite .",
    "it is then interesting to see whether it remains invariant for percolation models such that long - range correlation is involved , like bootstrap percolation .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the method and discuss some technical details , as well as the results for the critical parameters . in section [ csp ]",
    "we discuss some previous results concerning the critical spanning probability for percolation and our results for bootstrap percolation .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in the last section .",
    "the method we use is connected to real - space renormalization - group and finite - size scaling procedures @xcite .",
    "the approach needs that precise values of the physical quantities are available ; these are only obtained for high values of the linear system size @xmath33 .",
    "we then studied finite systems of size @xmath42 , with @xmath43 ; from the results for @xmath34 , it is possible to use finite - size scaling techniques to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the critical probability @xmath4 and the critical exponent @xmath24 are calculated as follows . for a lattice of size @xmath33",
    ", we occupy each site with probability @xmath1 , apply the bootstrap condition and test the lattice for percolation ( here we define percolation as the presence of a cluster which connects the bottom and top planes of the finite cubic lattice ; we discuss this and other technical points below ) .",
    "our finite - size estimate of the critical probability , @xmath45 , is taken as the value of @xmath1 at which the cell percolates for the first time , when @xmath1 is increased from zero ; this procedure is made for @xmath46 different runs ( which correspond to @xmath46 different seeds to the random number generator ) .",
    "each run leads to a different value of @xmath45 , since the lattice is finite .",
    "we take the average of the @xmath46 values of @xmath45 as our estimate of @xmath31 ( see section [ intro ] ) .",
    "it is then assumed that @xmath31 will approach @xmath4 as given by equation [ fss1 ] . moreover , it is possible to calculate the width @xmath47 , which behaves as ( @xmath48 stands for the average of @xmath49 over the @xmath46 realizations ) : @xmath50 from the previous equation and a @xmath51 plot of @xmath52 , it is then possible to obtain the value of the critical exponent @xmath24 .",
    "tha data is depicted in figure [ sig ] ; from the slope of the straight line we obtain @xmath53 .",
    "we compare this value with other evaluations in table [ crit ] ; within the numerical precision , this exponent is the same for bootstrap percolation with @xmath0 and ordinary percolation on the cubic lattice and agrees with previous evaluations of @xmath24 for bootstrap percolation with @xmath0 on the cubic lattice .",
    "note from the graph that the straight line regime is achieved for @xmath54 , while for uncorrelated percolation this regime sets in for smaller values of @xmath33 .",
    "this is expected , since finite - size effects are stronger for correlated percolation problems than for their uncorrelated counterparts @xcite .",
    "therefore , we neglect the data for @xmath55 and used only lattices with @xmath56 in our linear regression analysis .",
    "= 9.5 cm    in order to calculate the critical threshold , we resort to equations [ fss1 ] and [ fss2 ] , which imply that , for @xmath34 : @xmath57 this is a convenient way to calculate @xmath4 , since it does not depend on the value of @xmath24 ; such dependence would appear if equation [ fss1 ] was used . it is shown in figure [ sigma ] a plot of @xmath58 : @xmath4 is given by the linear coeficient and the value obtained is @xmath59 .",
    "this value is slightly above the one calculated in reference @xcite , in which the value of @xmath33 varied from 10 to 110 .",
    "if we use the same range in our calculation the extrapolated value of @xmath4 is consistent with the result of @xcite ( see table [ crit ] ) .",
    "= 9.5 cm    let us know discuss some technical points .",
    "an important quantity is the value of @xmath1 at which the lattice percolates for the first time , when @xmath1 is increased from zero .",
    "one needs to define what `` percolate '' means for a finite lattice . in this work",
    ", we used the rule called @xmath60 in reference @xcite , i.e. , a lattice percolates if , after the bootstrap culling process , there is a path of present sites which links the boundaries of the lattice in a fixed direction ( vertical , say ) .",
    "there are other possible definitions ( see @xcite ) and it is expected that all of them lead to the same value of @xmath4 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "note , however , that the value of the critical spanning probability does depend on this definition , as we will discuss i m section [ csp ] .",
    "the numerical procedure we used to test for percolation is the hoshen - kopelman algorithm @xcite : for usual percolation , it requires the storage of only one plane . for bootstrap percolation ,",
    "on the other hand , the bootstrap iteration needs the storage of the whole lattice , due to correlation effects . to cope with this drawback , we store the lattice in bits , instead of words : this saves memory and time , since the updates connected to the bootstrap rule can be made in parallel for a set of 32 sites @xcite . to define all six first - neighbours of sites at the boundaries of the lattice ,",
    "periodic boundary conditions are used .",
    "it is expected that the boundary condition does not affect the values of the critical parameters in the thermodynamic limit , since it is a `` surface '' effect .",
    "finally , let us mention that the number of realizations @xmath46 ( see section [ intro ] ) varied from 12000 for @xmath9 to 640 for @xmath10 ; the errors were calculated as three times the standard deviation for subsets of the total number of realizations .",

    ", one possible way is to define a `` ghost''- site , which is linked to all sites of the lattice with probability @xmath68 @xcite . within a real - space renormalization group framework ,",
    "it is possible to calculate the eigenvalue @xmath69 through , where @xmath70 is the average number of occupied sites linked to one of the boundary planes of the finite cubic lattice at the critical threshold , @xmath71 .",
    "the value of @xmath4 is obtained as explained above and is then used to calculate @xmath70 and hence @xmath72 , averaging over @xmath73 configurations . the value of @xmath73 varied from @xmath74 , for the smaller lattices , to @xmath75 , for the bigger ones .",
    "we use two procedures to obtain @xmath6 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the first one is based on the fact that , for @xmath76 : @xmath77 with @xmath6 independent of @xmath33 ; this equation leads to a straight line in a @xmath51 plot of @xmath78 , for @xmath34 . as depicted in figure [ yh ] , this is indeed the case for @xmath56 . from a linear fitting of the data for this range of @xmath33 , and resorting to the scaling relation @xmath79 , we obtained the value @xmath80 ( see table [ crit ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we could take into account correction - to - scaling terms , through : @xmath81 from this equation , we see that local slopes of @xmath82 provide estimates of @xmath83 , which , when extrapolated to @xmath84 , leads to an evaluation of @xmath6 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we have applied this procedure for @xmath43 , using three consecutive points to calulate the local slopes and extrapolating to @xmath76 through a @xmath85 graph .",
    "the value thus obtained for @xmath25 is the same as for the first procedure . in table",
    "[ crit ] we see that our estimate of @xmath25 disagrees with the values calculated in references @xcite and @xcite . in evaluating this exponent , the former uses lattices of linear size @xmath86 , while the latter uses @xmath87 ; neither attempted to make an extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit . from table",
    "[ crit ] , we can infer that our estimate of @xmath25 for the bootstrap model we study is , within the error bars , equal to the corresponding value of this exponent for usual ( uncorrelated ) percolation .",
    "since we have already seen that @xmath24 is also the same for both models , we can draw the conclusion that usual percolation and bootstrap percolation with @xmath0 on the cubic lattice belong to the same universality class .",
    "this result contradicts references @xcite and @xcite ; we believe this is caused by the small lattices used in those works .",
    "it has been established some time ago that the critical spanning probability , @xmath8 , defined as the probability of spanning a lattice at the critical point , shows some degree of universality @xcite .",
    "more precisely , this quantity does not depend on the lattice type and on the kind of percolation .",
    "this result contradicts the assumption made on early applications of real - space renormalization group procedures to percolation . in those",
    ", it was assumed that the critical spanning probability is equal to the critical percolation threshold , @xmath4 and , therefore , lattice dependent @xcite .",
    "however , later numerical tests confirmed and expanded the universality proposal @xcite .",
    "nevertheles , no study has been made on correlated models , to the best of our knowledge . while it is expected that _ short - range _ correlations do not change the universality scenario @xcite , it is not clear whether @xmath8 changes when _ long - range _ correlations are introduced .",
    "a convenient model to test these possibilities is the bootstrap percolation one . while the behaviour of @xmath8 is trivial for the cases where @xmath26 , for @xmath0 on the simple cubic lattice the presence of correlation may lead to a non trivial behavior .",
    "we study this possibility using numerical simulation on simple cubic lattices of size @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "the programs and algorithms used are essentially the same as the ones described in the previous section .",
    "the basic procedure is to generate @xmath73 independent runs for each lattice size and compute the fraction of those which percolate after the bootstrap condition is used and a stable configuration is reached .",
    "the values of @xmath73 are the same as those used in the calculation of @xmath6 ( see previous section ) .",
    "the results are depicted in figure [ rpc ] : we can infer that @xmath11 , where the error bar is a rough estimate .",
    "there are two previous calculation of @xmath8 for the uncorrelated site percolation on the cubic lattice with free boundary conditions : they lead to @xmath88 @xcite and @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "our value agrees , within the numerical error , with the first one but the result of reference @xcite can not be ruled out .",
    "it is then reasonable to infer that usual percolation and @xmath0 bootstrap percolation on the cubic lattice belong to the same universality class , also in what regards the critical spanning probability .",
    "we calculate , using numerical simulations and finite - size scaling techniques , the critical parameters of the bootstrap percolation model with @xmath0 on the cubic lattice , using finite lattices of size @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "our evaluations of @xmath24 and @xmath25 strongly support the conclusion that usual percolation and the model we study belong to the same universality class .",
    "this result disagrees with previous calculations @xcite ; we believe this is due to the small sizes used in those works . to support this assumption ,",
    "we note that the finite - size scaling assumptions hold for lattices of linear size @xmath54 , which are higher then the sizes studied in previous works .    the critical spanning probability , @xmath8 , is also calculated .",
    "it has been shown that this quantity shows some degree of universality , but , to the best of our knowledge , no study concerning correlated percolation models have been done so far .",
    "our result for bootstrap percolation with @xmath0 on the cubic lattice , @xmath11 , is , within the numerical accuracy , the same value as for usual percolation with free boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , we can infer that @xmath8 is not sensitive to short range correlations and even to some long range correlations , like the one studied in this paper .",
