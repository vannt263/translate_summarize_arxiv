    "determining the matter density of the universe is one of the key goals of observational cosmology . by definition ,",
    "the mean matter density is the product of the mean luminosity density and the mean mass - to - light ratio of the universe , , making the density parameter    @xmath12    one of the classic methods of inferring @xmath3 is to estimate the  ratios of galaxy groups or clusters , then multiply by the mean luminosity density derived from the galaxy luminosity function ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however",
    ", dynamical methods of estimating necessarily focus on dense regions of the galaxy distribution , so this route to @xmath3 relies on the assumption that the galaxy population in these region is representative of the universe as a whole . observed ratios rise steadily from the scale of binary galaxies to groups to rich clusters , but there is an approximate plateau in  values for the richest bound systems , and the mass - to - light ratios inferred from the dynamics of superclusters and the extended infall regions around clusters extend this plateau to larger scales ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter b00 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the existence of this plateau is sometimes taken as evidence that the measured values of  do indeed represent the universal value .",
    "this paper has two goals .",
    "the first is to assess the above line of reasoning : does the existence of a plateau in  at large scales imply that the universal value has been reached ? the second is to assess the implications of observed  ratios for the values of @xmath3 and the matter fluctuation amplitude @xmath0 , which we will show plays a crucial role .",
    "( here @xmath0 is the rms matter fluctuation in spheres of radius 8 , calculated from the linear matter power spectrum , where @xmath13 mpc@xmath14 . )",
    "the key to these assessments is a model for the relation between galaxies and dark matter ( a.k.a .",
    "galaxy bias ) that extends to the non - linear regime .",
    "we will derive this relation empirically , by fitting models of the halo occupation distribution ( hod ; see @xcite and references therein ) to the projected correlation functions of galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , along the lines of zehavi et al .",
    "( 2004a , b ) .",
    "hod models describe bias at the level of virialized halos by the probability @xmath15 that a halo of virial mass @xmath16 contains @xmath17 galaxies of a specified type , together with prescriptions for spatial and velocity biases within halos .",
    "b00 also addressed the complications of mass - to - light ratios , drawing on the results of a hydrodynamic simulation of the galaxy population .",
    "their simulation predicts a plateau in the @xmath18-band that is close to the universal value , except for a modest `` anti - bias '' arising from the older stellar populations of galaxies in dense environments . applying this anti - bias correction to the observed  values",
    ", they infer @xmath19 .",
    "however , b00 considered only a single cosmological model , with @xmath20 .",
    "we will show that , when the bias relation is inferred empirically by matching the observed correlation function , a plateau in  at high halo masses or overdensities is a generic result .",
    "however , the plateau corresponds to the true universal  _ only _ for models with @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the rms galaxy count fluctuation . for lower @xmath0 , galaxies must be positively biased to match the observed clustering , and the  plateau is below the universal value . for higher @xmath0 ,",
    "the galaxy population is anti - biased in the dense regions , and the  plateau is higher than the universal value .",
    "@xcite infer hod parameters as a function of galaxy @xmath1-band luminosity by fitting measurements of the projected galaxy correlation function , assuming a cosmological model with @xmath23 .",
    "we carry out a similar procedure , but we consider a range of @xmath0 values from 0.6 to 0.95 .",
    "we keep the shape of the linear matter power spectrum @xmath24 fixed , regardless of @xmath0 or @xmath3 , because it is well constrained empirically by the combination of microwave background anisotropies and large - scale galaxy clustering measurements ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and because the physical effects of changes in @xmath3 are much more transparent if they are kept separate from @xmath24 changes with all other parameters held constant alters the shape of @xmath24 .",

    ", we can calculate  as a function of halo mass analytically , given the hod parameters derived by fitting  ( see  2 ) . to compute  over larger scales , we use the derived hods to populate the halos of n - body simulations .    as shown by @xcite , for a fixed linear power spectrum",
    ", a change to @xmath3 simply shifts the mass and velocity scales of virialized halos , with negligible effect on the shape of the halo mass function or the clustering of halos at a given ( scaled ) mass . for two cosmological models that differ only in the value of @xmath3",
    ", we can obtain identical real - space galaxy clustering by simply shifting the hod mass scale in proportion to @xmath3 .",
    "with bias constrained by the observed clustering , therefore , our predicted  ratios for a given @xmath0 are simply proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "we will often indicate this scaling by quoting predicted  ratios in units of , where @xmath25 .",
    "the scaling with @xmath26 arises in the observations because inferred dynamical masses scale as @xmath27 and luminosities as @xmath28 .",
    "the same @xmath26 scaling arises in the predictions because the characteristic mass in the halo mass function is proportional to @xmath27 at fixed @xmath3 and @xmath0 and we automatically impose the observed luminosity scale , which is proportional to @xmath28 .",
    "uncertainties in the value of @xmath26 therefore have no impact on our conclusions .",

    "alternative methods of inferring @xmath3 , from cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , the shape of the galaxy power spectrum , type ia supernovae , and the baryon - to - total mass ratio in clusters , have begun to converge on a significantly higher value of @xmath30 ( e.g. turner 2002 ) .",
    "recently tegmark  ( 2004 ) combined wmap cmb data with the sdss galaxy power spectrum to infer @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite combined these data with the sdss lyman-@xmath32 forest spectrum to obtain @xmath33 .",
    "the tension between  estimates of @xmath3 and the higher values from other methods warrants a careful investigation of the assumptions that underly the  approach .",
    "we will show that the conflict can be alleviated if @xmath0 is low , @xmath34 .",
    "however , the discrepancy persists for a matter fluctuation amplitude of @xmath10 , which is favored by the @xcite and @xcite analyses .",
    "our approach is similar in spirit to the conditional luminosity function ( clf ) analyses of clustering in the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ; @xcite ) by yang et al .",

    "we fit the full projected correlation function , while the above clf papers fit the luminosity dependence of the galaxy correlation length , together with the galaxy luminosity function . despite the many differences in analysis and parameterization , and the use of independent galaxy clustering measurements derived from an @xmath1-band selected sample instead of a @xmath35-selected sample",
    ", we reach a bottom line similar to that of @xcite : obtaining cluster mass - to - light ratios close to the observational estimates of @xmath36 ( e.g. @xcite ; b00 ) requires either @xmath3 or @xmath0 to be significantly below the currently favored values of 0.3 and 0.9 ( see  4 ) .",
    "the key ingredient in the hod prescription of galaxy bias is @xmath15 , the probability that a halo of mass @xmath16 contains @xmath17 galaxies of a specified class .",
    "the galaxy classes we will consider are defined by thresholds in @xmath1-band luminosity . our model for @xmath15",
    "is motivated by theoretical studies of the hod using semi - analytic galaxy formation methods , high - resolution n - body simulations , and full hydrodynamic cosmological simulations ( specifically @xcite and @xcite ; for earlier work see @xcite , 1999 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "the number of central galaxies above the luminosity threshold changes sharply from zero to one at a minimum halo mass @xmath37 .",
    "we also consider a model in which the probability of hosting a central galaxy is @xmath38 , to test the sensitivity of our results to the assumed sharpness of the central galaxy threshold .    we adopt a functional form    @xmath39    for the mean number of satellites in a halo of mass @xmath40 , and @xmath41 for @xmath42 . here",
    "@xmath43 is a cutoff mass scale for the satellite galaxy power law , which allows a soft transition to halo masses that host no satellites .",
    "@xcite showed that a model of this form allows good fits to the observed for the concordance cosmology , though they mainly focused on an alternative parameterization with a sharp cutoff in @xmath44 and a free power - law index @xmath45 .",
    "the fixed-@xmath32 with varying @xmath43 parameterization is better suited to our purposes here because we will difference occupation functions for adjacent luminosity thresholds to obtain @xmath15 for luminosity bins , and small statistical errors in @xmath32 can drastically affect the number of of satellites in individual bins at high halo mass .",
    "we assume a poisson distribution of satellite number relative to the mean @xmath44 , as implied by the theoretical studies .",
    "this parameterization of @xmath15 , while restricted , has the virtue of capturing theoretical predictions quite well while introducing only three free parameters .",
    "an essentially perfect fit to theoretical results requires two additional parameters providing freedom in @xmath32 and the central galaxy cutoff shape ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we expect the three parameter model to be adequate to our purposes here , predicting the mass - to - light ratios in and around high mass halos",
    ".    we will investigate the effects of changing the assumed value of @xmath32 , but we note that the choice of @xmath46 is well motivated by the results of semi - analytic models , hydrodynamic simulations , and collisionless n - body simulations ( @xcite ) .",
    "observational estimates of @xmath32 are subject to the effects of interlopers , completeness limits , and uncertainty in the halo mass estimates , and the agreement among observational estimates is not as good as for the theoretical studies .",

    "our results for @xmath23 are similar to those of @xcite , except for the slight differences in parameterization and calculational method ( see appendix b ) .",
    "for all calculations , we adopt a linear theory matter power spectrum with inflationary spectral index @xmath53 and shape parameter @xmath54 in the parameterization of @xcite .",
    "satellite galaxies are assumed to follow the `` universal '' halo density profile of navarro , frenk , & white ( 1997 ) with no internal spatial bias .",
    "the halo concentrations are calculated in the same manner as kuhlen ( 2004 ) assuming @xmath55 , with the halo edge defined as the radius at which the mean interior density is 200 times the mean value .",
    "the calculation of  for a specified cosmology and hod is described in appendix b. our method is similar to that of @xcite , which was used by @xcite , but we implement an improved treatment of halo exclusion and adopt more accurate halo bias factors inferred from our n - body simulations ( appendix a ) .",
    "the data for each luminosity threshold are fit by minimizing 2using the full covariance matrix for each sample .",
    "the jackknife estimates of these matrices are discussed in detail by @xcite .",
    "the number of free parameters in the fit is reduced from three to two by matching the space density of galaxies for each sample . in practice , this constraint is used to fix the value of @xmath37 for a given @xmath43 and @xmath56 . we ignore the uncertainty in the space density itself .",
    "we require that the number density of satellite galaxies between two adjacent magnitude limits be smaller for the brighter sample at all halo masses , a consistency condition that only affected the result in two of the 45 fits performed .",
    "the results of the fits are listed in table 1 .",

    "the larger error bars allow the best - fit hod models to differentiate some at large scales , even though the @xmath59 values per degree of freedom are all less than one . note that strong covariances between data points make a simple visual estimate of @xmath59 unreliable . in figure [ wp_fits]b , the data are plotted against the nonlinear matter correlation functions for each value of @xmath0 .",
    "these correlation functions are calculated by fourier transformation of the @xcite non - linear @xmath60 , which takes the linear power spectrum as input , and assume @xmath55 .",
    "the differences in the matter distributions are large , but are easily overcome even with our restrictive three - parameter hod .",
    "the values of @xmath59 per degree of freedom for the hod fits fluctuate from sample to sample , with a median value below 1.0 for @xmath61 and above 1.0 for @xmath62 .",
    "we do not regard the somewhat higher @xmath59 values as significant arguments against low @xmath0 , however , because our three - parameter description of the hod is quite restrictive .",
    "in addition , adopting a cmbfast ( @xcite ) power spectrum with the @xcite cosmological parameters in place of the @xmath54 , @xcite power spectrum has a noticeable effect on @xmath59 values , though it makes almost no difference to the best - fit hod parameters themselves .",
    "adding freedom to the hod parameterization or changing the input power spectrum could thus have significant effect on the quality of the  fits , but we expect only minor influence on our mass - to - light ratio predictions because the overall shape of @xmath63 is well constrained by the number density and  measurements",
    ".    from the hod fits listed in table 1 , we can calculate a discrete estimate of the conditional luminosity function , , the luminosity function of galaxies in halos of mass @xmath2 . since the hods describe samples brighter than a specified absolute magnitude , differencing the number of galaxies in a halo of mass @xmath2 within the magnitude bin of width @xmath64 mag yields  within that bin :    @xmath65    we use luminosity rather than magnitude on the left hand side of equation ( [ e.clf ] ) for clarity of notation . in this form ,",
    "equation ( [ e.clf ] ) is normalized such that a summation of over all magnitude bins returns @xmath63 for the @xmath66 sample .",
    "the parameters in table 1 assume our standard hod model with a sharp threshold for the central galaxy occupation .",
    "when we use an exponential cutoff for the central occupation , we keep the same values of @xmath56 and @xmath43 but adjust @xmath37 slightly so that the mean galaxy space density remains fixed .",
    "figure [ clf ] plots the conditional luminosity functions for three halo masses for the exponential central cutoff .",
    "panel ( a ) shows for @xmath67 , normalized so that the area under each curve is the total number of galaxies expected at this halo mass .",
    "the dashed line that falls rapidly at @xmath68 is the satellite galaxy contribution to  for the model with @xmath69 . at this low halo mass ,",
    "the number of satellite galaxies brighter than @xmath70 is smaller than the number of central galaxies , but satellites dominate at the faintest magnitudes .",
    "the variation of  with @xmath0 is minimal because at this point on the halo mass function the space density of halos is only weakly sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "the difference in the total number of galaxies brighter than @xmath70 between the low and high values of @xmath0 is @xmath71 .",
    "panel ( b ) shows  for @xmath72 .",
    "halos of this mass are intermediate between those that host galaxy groups and clusters , with @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "satellite galaxies dominate the conditional luminosity functions out to @xmath75 , beyond which the brighter central galaxies dominate .",
    "the different values of @xmath0 now produce small differences in the overall normalization of . as @xmath0 decreases , the space density and clustering amplitude of high mass halos decreases , and the mean occupation of these halos must grow to keep the galaxy number density and clustering amplitude constant .",
    "in panel ( c ) , which plots  for cluster - sized halos of @xmath76 , the differences in the models are clear .",
    "the low-@xmath0 model has nearly twice as many galaxies per halo as @xmath69 .",
    "for all the models ,  is dominated by satellite galaxies at all but the brightest magnitude bin .",
    "our eventual qualitative conclusion is already evident from figure [ clf ] . with the galaxy space density and clustering amplitude fixed to match observations ,",
    "a low-@xmath0 model must have a larger fraction of its galaxies in massive halos , and it therefore predicts lower mass - to - light ratios in these halos .    to quantify this point , we calculate mass - to - light ratios as a function of halo mass by summing over luminosity ,    @xmath77^{-1},\\ ] ]    where @xmath78 denotes the magnitude threshold , which runs from @xmath79 to @xmath80 . all galaxies in each magnitude bin are assumed to be at the midpoint of the bin , and galaxies in the @xmath81 sample are assumed to have @xmath82 , an assumption that has negligible influence on the results .",
    "equation ( [ e.ml_halo ] ) is equivalent to @xmath83 given our discrete estimate of  in equation ( [ e.clf ] ) .    before proceeding to our main results ,",
    "we want to check the sensitivity of our calculations to the form of the central galaxy cutoff and the value of @xmath32 . in figure [ hod_compare]a , points with error bars are the sdss data for @xmath57 from @xcite , and the solid line shows the fit with a hard cutoff and the parameters in table 1 for @xmath69 .",
    "filled circles show for the same values of @xmath56 and @xmath43 , but an exponential cutoff , with @xmath37 adjusted to retain the galaxy density .",
    "the differences in the calculated correlation functions are barely discernible , mostly confined to the two - halo term at small scales , where the one - halo term dominates  anyway .",
    "figure [ hod_compare]b shows an example of  for the soft and hard central cutoffs for @xmath69 at @xmath84 .",
    "the low luminosity regimes are identical , but at high luminosities where central galaxies dominate , the central cutoff produces a well - defined bump , which is smoothed out in the exponential cutoff model .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the mass - to - light ratio as a function of halo mass for these two prescriptions .",
    "the sharp cutoff model produces artificial jumps in the  function , but the overall trend and , more importantly , the behavior at high halo masses are the same for hard and soft cutoffs .",
    "we conclude that the details of the central galaxy cutoff do not significantly affect the mass - to - light ratio predictions .    in figure [ vary_alpha ]",
    "we quantify the dependence of our results on the value of @xmath32 .",
    "first , we refit  and calculate  for @xmath23 with @xmath85 , 0.95 , 1.05 , and 1.1 .",
    "the results are shown , along with the fiducial results for @xmath46 , as the five curves in figure [ vary_alpha]a .",
    "the  ratios are nearly identical at group masses and below . at @xmath86",
    "the curves begin to separate , with lower @xmath32 resulting in higher , and vice versa , due to the different scalings of galaxy number with halo mass .",
    "our second method for testing the sensitivity to @xmath32 uses a much more flexible hod parameterization in which the value of satellite mean occupation is specified at @xmath87 13 , 14 , and 15 , connected by a cubic spline and smoothly truncated at low masses ( see figure  19 of @xcite for examples of similar fits ) . with this extra freedom , it is difficult to guarantee that @xmath44 is a monotonically increasing function of luminosity threshold , so we have therefore fit the @xcite measurements for samples in absolute magnitude bins , rather than magnitude thresholds . in each bin , we assume that @xmath88 in a range @xmath89 and @xmath90 elsewhere , equivalent to our sharp cutoff assumption for luminosity threshold samples . using a monte carlo markov chain ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we identify between 17 and 42 models for each luminosity bin that have @xmath91 relative to the best fit model . using all @xmath92 possible combinations of these models , we evaluate the @xmath93 ratios at the cluster mass scale .",
    "the distribution of @xmath93 values with respect to the mean at a given mass has an approximately gaussian core with a half - width of 11% at 10% of the maximum . at lower probabilities , there is a tail toward high @xmath93 values that arises from hod fits that are statistically acceptable but physically implausible , with anomalously high halo masses for central galaxies .",
    "there is no corresponding tail to low @xmath93 values , since if one puts too many galaxies in clusters the correlation function is inevitably too high .",
    "the shaded region in figure [ vary_alpha]a shows the full - width at 10% maximum as a function of halo mass .",
    "this test also accounts for statistical uncertainty in the  measurements themselves .",
    "figure [ vary_alpha]b quantifies the change in the average cluster  as a function of @xmath32 .",

    "although the differences in the  curves of panel ( a ) appear large at the highest halo mass , the impact of these differences in moderated in panel ( b ) because clusters above @xmath101  are relatively rare .",
    "we conclude that for any given cosmology , the existing  measurements constrain the average cluster mass - to - light ratio , the quantity most relevant to our conclusions , to within about 10% . however , the detailed shape of the  curve at @xmath102  depends on the assumed form of the hod .",

    "we find similar results comparing to the @xmath93 ratios of sdss clusters inferred from @xcite or to the @xmath93 ratios of the virial regions of clusters found by @xcite , but the systematic uncertainties are larger and harder to quantify because of our reliance on mean scaling relations in the former case and the complications of passband and geometry conversions in the latter .",

    "earlier analyses of cluster mass functions have generally yielded higher normalizations of this constraint ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the mass function and mass - to - light ratio methods both incorporate cluster masses , they are physically distinct : the former has no dependence on galaxy luminosities , and the latter uses an average mass and is therefore insensitive to scatter in observational estimates .",

    "as noted in  2 , changing the assumed linear matter power spectrum from the @xcite parameterization to a cmbfast calculation makes a significant difference to the @xmath59 values of  fits but minimal change to the hod parameters themselves , so our @xmath93 predictions are not sensitive to modest changes in the power spectrum shape .",
    "the main source of systematic uncertainty is our predictions is therefore the 10% uncertainty associated with the hod parameterization and the  measurements , discussed at the end of  2 ( see fig . [ vary_alpha ] ) .    turning to the observational uncertainties ,",

    "cluster mass estimation is a challenging problem , but the generally good agreement between virial mass estimates , jeans equation estimates , and estimates from x - ray or weak lensing data ( see bahcall & comerford [ 2002 ] and references therein ) argues against a systematic error as large as a factor of @xmath227 , the ratio of our predicted @xmath93 for @xmath220 , @xmath219 to carlberg et al.s ( @xcite ) observational estimate .",
    "luminosities could be biased high if background subtraction methods do not adequately account for overdense structures surrounding clusters , an issue that warrants further investigation with realistic mock galaxy catalogs .",
    "we see no obvious holes in the cmb + large scale structure analyses , but in contrast to the approach taken here and in @xcite , these methods of inferring cosmological parameters rely on a detailed theoretical model of primordial fluctuations and their linear evolution , and they are sensitive to quantities like the electron scattering optical depth , the cmb tensor - to - scalar ratio , and the curvature of the inflationary fluctuation spectrum .    at present , it seems plausible that the results of these different methods can be reconciled without major revisions , if @xmath194 and @xmath198 lie at the low end of the ranges allowed by @xcite or @xcite , cluster @xmath93 ratios are somewhat higher than the estimates shown in figures  [ ml_halo ] and  [ ml_cluster ] , and our hod parameterization leads to a modest over - prediction of @xmath93 for a given @xmath194 and @xmath198 .",

    "halo bias factors are an important ingredient in analytic calculations of galaxy clustering , including those in this paper . following the pioneering work of @xcite ,",
    "a number of authors have investigated halo bias using n - body simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , many of these studies are based on simulations of either low mass resolution or limited box size ( the main exception is the recent study of seljak & warren [ 2004 ] , which we discuss below ) .",
    "most previous studies have also compared different cosmologies such as open and standard cdm to one version of , rather than focusing on variants of the cosmology with a wide range of @xmath0 as we have done here .",
    "we have also performed an identical set of simulations with a power spectrum shape parameter of @xmath228 , which significantly increases the large - scale power and reduces the power on small scales relative to our standard choice of @xmath54 .",
    "our simulations are therefore well suited to investigate halo bias for the cosmological models of the greatest interest today , and to investigate the dependence of bias factors on power spectrum shape or normalization .",
    "the use of five realizations and a reasonably large volume ( 253  on a side ) yields good statistics for high mass halos .",
    "note that we define halos using a friends - of - friends algorithm with linking length @xmath229 .",
    "alternative definitions would yield slightly different halo masses ( see @xcite ) and would therefore require a slightly different formula for @xmath163 .",
    "the halo bias factor can be defined by the ratio of halo and mass autocorrelations , or power spectra , or using the halo  mass cross - correlation .",
    "since we are interested in modeling galaxy autocorrelations , we adopt the definition @xmath230 , where @xmath231 is the autocorrelation function of halos of mass @xmath16 and @xmath232 is the non - linear matter correlation function measured from the simulations .",

    "the inset box in figure [ halo_bias ] plots an example of using equation ( [ e.bg ] ) to calculate the galaxy bias with our modified parameters of equation ( [ e.smt ] ) , which we compare to the galaxy bias in the simulations calculated by the same method as the halo bias for five values of @xmath0 .",
    "the plot symbols represent the galaxy bias calculated from the simulations , and the solid lines represent the analytic calculations ( eq . [ [ e.bg ] ] ) using equation ( [ e.smt ] ) with our new parameters . for this test",

    "the analytically calculated bias factors differ from the simulation results by @xmath250% .",
    "recently seljak & warren ( 2004 , hereafter sw ) proposed a new empirically determined halo bias relation , empirically calibrated on large simulations ( up to @xmath251 particles ) with cosmological parameters close to the best - fit values from cmb and large - scale structure measurements .",
    "the dotted line in figure [ halo_bias ] shows the sw formula evaluated for @xmath54 and @xmath23 , which fits our numerical data accurately .",
    "however , the sw formula is expressed in terms of @xmath252 , where @xmath253 , instead of @xmath236 , and the mapping between @xmath252 and @xmath254 depends on the amplitude and shape of the power spectrum .",
    "we find that the sw formula becomes a poor fit to our results at low @xmath194 , and the discrepancies are worse for @xmath228 , as illustrated in the inset box by calculating the galaxy bias parameters with the sw halo bias formula .",
    "thus , their formula is accurate for models close to the cosmological concordance model , but our modified version of the smt formula , with @xmath254 as the halo mass parameter , applies more universally .    we have not investigated alternative definitions of bias using the power spectrum or mass cross - correlation , or using linear instead of non - linear matter clustering .",
    "we also note that our numerical results do not extend much below @xmath255 , and simulations of smaller volumes or larger dynamic range are needed to test equation ( [ e.smt ] ) in the low mass regime .",
    "our analytic calculation of the two - point galaxy correlation function is similar to that presented by @xcite and used in zehavi s ( 2004a , b ) modeling of the sdss .",
    "here we report improvements in the procedure that have been incorporated in our present analysis . for completeness and clarity",
    ", we describe the method from start to finish .",
    "the new ingredients are the use of the modified halo bias formula of appendix a and the more accurate treatment of halo exclusion described by equations ( [ e.pgg_sph ] ) and ( [ e.pgg_ell ] ) . the @xcite procedure was calibrated and tested using the 144 , @xmath256 particle gif simulation of @xcite , which was also used to calibrate the smt formula .",

    "we use an nfw profile with concentration parameters as a function of halo mass calculated by the method of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the one - halo term dominates  at small scales , while the two - halo term fully accounts for all galaxy pairs at separations @xmath273 .",
    "the transition region between one - halo and two - halo dominance is difficult to model because only certain regions of the halo mass function can contribute to the two - halo term at small scales .",
    "the range of halo masses included must ensure that halo pairs do not overlap , since such halo pairs would be merged into a single halo by the friends - of - friends scheme that we use to define halos in the first place .",
    "it is this one - halo to two - halo transition that causes  to deviate from a power - law at scales near 1 ( @xcite ) ; as @xmath1 increases , @xmath274 drops rapidly , while the rise in @xmath275 is regulated by halo exclusion . for brighter galaxies , which preferentially occupy high - mass halos , the rise in @xmath275 occurs at a larger @xmath1 , making the deviation from a power - law greater for brighter galaxy samples .    since the radial distribution of galaxies within halos",
    "must be accounted for in the calculation of the two - halo term , the calculation itself is done in fourier space , where the convolutions with the halo density profile become multiplications instead ( @xcite ) . in the method of @xcite , halo exclusion was treated by only including halos with virial radii less than half the value of @xmath1 for which  is being calculated , i.e.  with masses below      where @xmath97 is the virial overdensity of the halo , relative to the mean density , which we have chosen to be 200 . with this implementation of halo exclusion , the calculation of the two - halo term in fourier space is      where @xmath278 is the fourier transform of the halo density profile ( e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath279 is the halo bias at separation @xmath1 , and the restricted number density @xmath280 is the average number density of galaxies that reside in halos with @xmath281 ,      the matter power spectrum , @xmath283 , is the non - linear form given by @xcite . at large @xmath1 , equation ( [ e.pgg ] ) can be thought of as simply multiplying the non - linear matter power spectrum by the galaxy pair - weighted halo bias factor to obtain the galaxy power spectrum . at smaller separations the finite size of the halos",
    "must be taken into account .",
    "the scale dependence of halo bias also becomes important at @xmath284 .",
    "parameterizing the scale dependence by the amplitude of the non - linear matter correlation function , the scale dependence of halo bias is well described by      where @xmath286 is the large - scale bias , for which we have used the bias relation given in appendix a. equation ( [ e.scale_bias ] ) , determined from inspection of our numerical simulations , is fairly accurate for the full range of @xmath0 values and both values of @xmath247 explored in this paper .        where @xmath289 denotes that we have calculated the two - halo term for a restricted range of the halo mass function .",
    "the value calculated in equation ( [ e.pk2xi ] ) is converted to a probability over random for the entire halo ( and therefore galaxy ) population by      the virtue of this implementation is that the integral over mass in equation ( [ e.pgg ] ) is calculated once and squared , instead of being a double integral over different halo pairs .",

    "the two - halo term is much less sensitive to the mass function , and is not affected by this difference .",
    "the numerical test in the appendix of @xcite showed a much smaller discrepancy on large scales because the 144  gif simulation used for the test ( and for the calibration of the smt bias factors ) has a high amplitude of large scale clustering for low mass halos . with our multiple , larger volume simulations , the need for lower halo bias factors is evident , and these in turn drive the need for a more accurate treatment of halo exclusion .",

    "the range of halo masses over which the two - halo term is calculated is different than that in equation ( [ e.pgg ] ) , and the restricted number density @xmath280 must reflect that change .",

    "<S> , observationally motivated power spectrum shape and increasing normalization @xmath0 , we find parameters of the galaxy halo occupation distribution ( hod ) that reproduce measurements as a function of luminosity from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) . from these hod models </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the @xmath1-band conditional luminosity function , and from this the mean  ratio as a function of halo mass @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also use  to populate halos of n - body simulations with galaxies and thereby compute  in a range of large - scale environments , including cluster infall regions . for all cosmological models , </S>",
    "<S> the  ratio in high mass halos or high density regions is approximately independent of halo mass or smoothing scale . </S>",
    "<S> however , the `` plateau '' value of depends on @xmath0 in addition to the obvious proportionality with the matter density parameter @xmath3 , and it represents the universal value @xmath4 only for models in which the galaxy correlation function is approximately unbiased , i.e. , with @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> our results for cluster mass halos follow the trend @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> combined with carlberg et al.s ( @xcite ) mean  ratio for cnoc galaxy clusters , this relation implies @xmath7 .  </S>",
    "<S> estimates for sdss clusters and the virial regions of clusters in the cairns survey imply a similar value of @xmath8 , while the cairns estimates for cluster infall regions imply a lower value . </S>",
    "<S> these results are inconsistent with parameter values @xmath9 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath10 favored by recent joint analyses of cosmic microwave background measurements and other large scale structure data , though they agree with values inferred from van den bosch et al.s ( @xcite ) analysis of the 2df galaxy redshift survey . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss possible resolutions of this discrepancy , none of which seems entirely satisfactory . in appendices we present an improved formula for halo bias factors calibrated on our @xmath11 n - body simulations and an improved analytic technique for calculating the galaxy correlation function from a given cosmological model and hod . </S>"
