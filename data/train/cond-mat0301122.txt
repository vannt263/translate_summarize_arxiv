    "@xmath4 transition metal compounds show a variety of mott phenomena @xcite , what is readily understood since for these systems , the electron  electron interaction ( measured by an effective hubbard @xmath5 ) is comparable to the bandwidth @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath7 and , quite in particular , @xmath8 transition metal compounds are supposed to be less correlated because of their relatively wide @xmath9-bands .",
    "for example , the @xmath8 oxide reo@xmath10 is a good metal with wide @xmath9-bands .",
    "there are , however , indications that a few @xmath8 compounds also show correlation effects  or at least , they show cooperative behavior with no obvious interpretation in terms of independent electron theory . the mott localization aspects of the low - temperature behavior of 1t - tas@xmath0 are long known @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest turned towards pyrochlore oxides @xcite .",
    "y@xmath0ir@xmath0o@xmath1 is characterized as a mott insulator @xcite .",
    "cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 undergoes a metal  insulator transition at 220k .",
    "the phenomenon is remarkably well described as a bcs - type mean field transition which clearly involves the ordering of an electronic degree of freedom on the background of a rigid lattice @xcite .",
    "this led to the proposal of a slater transition of the spins @xcite , which is further supported by evidence that charge ordering is unimportant @xcite .",
    "let us note , however , that the supposed spin - density - like order parameter is experimentally not yet identified , and it would be no simple matter to postulate it because of the frustrated nature of the pyrochlore lattice @xcite .",
    "whatever the nature of the order parameter , there is a basic difficulty : according to band theory , the fermi surface of cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 does not seem to be nested @xcite , and it is difficult to see how a small - amplitude order can immediately open gaps all over the fermi surface .",
    "this difficulty alone suffices to infer that correlation effects are important .",
    "we may generally ask what is so particular about the above cited compounds that we may consider them as correlated @xmath8 electron systems .",
    "the common feature is the geometrical frustration of the transition metal sublattice ( triangular lattice for 1t - tas@xmath0 , pyrochlore for cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 ) .",
    "the concept of frustration was introduced for ising antiferromagnets @xcite , and it can be generalized to quantum magnets and mott - localized spin - orbital systems with `` antiferro '' interactions . generally speaking ,",
    "frustration prevents two - sublattice order , forcing the system to choose either multi - sublattice ( non - collinear ) order , or spin or / and orbital liquid states .",
    "it is less obvious what frustration should mean for itinerant systems , but one can argue that it involves the suppression of kinetic energy by desctructive interference , and the resulting enhanced importance of interaction effects .",
    "weak coupling density wave phases tend to be eliminated and instead , local correlation effects like mass enhancement and the opening of a spin gap dominate @xcite .",
    "a clear - cut example of the effect of frustration on weakly interacting electron systems is provided by the @xmath11-orbital hubbard model on the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the tight binding band structure contains a twofold degenerate zero - dispersion subband , which gives rise to marked correlation effects even in the weak coupling limit @xcite . however , flat subbands are not expected to occur in real systems . re and os",
    "pyrochlore oxides are more closely described by taking a @xmath12 tight binding model on the pyrochlore lattice ; this model gives dispersive subbands .",
    "experience with mott - localized spin - orbital systems ( modelled by the kugel  khomskii hamiltonian ) suggests that the spin and orbital degrees of freedom play similar roles , and this should hold for correlated itinerant systems as well .",
    "indeed , the rpa treatment of the @xmath12 pyrochlore hubbard model indicates that both spin and orbital fluctuations are important , and that spin antiferromagnetism and orbital ferromagnetism are competing instabilities @xcite .",
    "one way to judge the importance of correlation effects is to check to which extent standard band structure calculations can account for the observed properties .",
    "the lda electronic structure of both cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 and cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 has been determined @xcite .",
    "it is curious that cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 which has an unmistakable metal",
    " insulator transition , appears as not particularly correlated : the specific heat coefficient @xmath13 of the metallic phase is relatively well explained by the calculated density of states @xmath14 . in contrast , there is a discrepancy between the lda result and the measured @xmath13 for cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 , and there is a mass enhancement factor @xmath15 to account for .",
    "actually , the two calculations give somewhat different estimates for @xmath16 : singh et al .",
    "@xcite imply that their @xmath17 is not unexpected for a superconductor , i.e. , that it could be due to electron ",
    "phonon coupling , while harima @xcite finds @xmath18 , and concludes that cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 is a strongly correlated system .",
    "optical data indicating an even higher @xmath19 certainly add to the weight of evidence that electron correlation is important in cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite ; however , the origin of the discrepancy between the specific heat and optical estimates for the mass enhancement factor remains unclear .",
    "sakai et al .",
    "@xcite interpret susceptibility and nmr data as indicating localized moment character , which is synonymous with local correlations .",
    "taken in itself , @xmath16 is probably not sufficient to allow us to decide whether either of these pyrochlore oxides is strongly correlated ; neither would such an assertion explain readily all what is seen . the large unit cell and the threefold degeneracy of the @xmath12 band are enough to show that individual subbands have to be narrow , and therefore electron ",
    "electron interaction is certainly important : it must be at least comparable to the subband widths , and also to the inter - subband pseudogaps .",
    "there is a variety of spin , and orbital , but also spin - to - orbital correlations which may become important in the range up to room temperature .",
    "furthermore , the frustrated nature of the lattice precludes any simple ordering scenario , and therefore short - range intersite , or even multi - site , correlations have to be considered .",
    "because of the lattice geometry , it is likely that the short - range correlated states can be envisaged as consisting of tetrahedron units with internal degrees of freedom .",
    "such basic units of the correlated electronic state may couple to the lattice , which gives the possibility of tetramerization with the electronic degrees of freedom still fluctuating .",
    "alternatively , the electronic degrees of freedom may become frozen into a collective state whose definition relies on the unique features of the network of tetrahedra @xcite .",
    "we note that the idea of `` bond chirality ordering '' was advocated in a recent investigation of the low temperature lattice structure of cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite .    here",
    "we present the results of electrical resistivity and thermopower measurements on cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 in the pressure range 02 gpa .",
    "our basic finding is that there is a wide range of temperature ( roughly @xmath20 ) where the electronic state of the material is `` soft '' , which is shown by the strong pressure dependence of the thermopower @xmath21 ( and to a lesser extent also of the resistivity @xmath22 ) .",
    "the existence , and extreme pressure sensitivity , of the so - called second phase transition of cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , is only one aspect of this behavior .",
    "we display a phase diagram based on thermopower anomalies , including data on the pressure dependence of the second structural transition .",
    "measuring thermopower under pressure is currently the only way to learn about the shape of that phase boundary .",
    "cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 is unique among the @xmath8 pyrochlores inasmuch as it is the only member of this group which is known to become superconducting at @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "however , we discuss only the normal metallic phases , for which similarities and dissimilarities to other systems are of interest .",
    "the contrasting behavior of cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 and cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 is intriguing .",
    "at room temperature @xmath25 both are bad metals with similar values of the nearly temperature independent resistivity corresponding roughly to a mean free path of the order of the lattice constant .",
    "band structure calculation @xcite shows they are @xmath8 semimetals with the fermi level position corresponding to a 1/3- , and 1/2- , filled @xmath12 subband , resp .",
    "we know of no feature of the density of states , or the fermi surface , which would obviously account for the fact that    cd@xmath0os@xmath0o@xmath1 becomes an insulator at 220k , while at almost the same transition temperature @xmath26200k cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 becomes a better metal . in the notation @xmath27",

    "the low-@xmath32 normal state resistivity @xcite extrapolates to 30@xmath35 cm .",
    "the resistivity change around @xmath36 could be compatible either with a change in the scattering mechanism , or a change in carrier concentration , or a combination of both .",
    "whether a phase transition occurs , has to be decided from other measurements .    closer examination of the resistivity ( @xmath22 ) versus @xmath32 plot reveals that the slope passes through a maximum , a minimum , and reaches a maximum again at @xmath27 , thus plotting @xmath37 vs @xmath32 readily offers the possibility of identifying characteristic temperatures as either extrema , or zeroes , of the derivative .",
    "we illustrate this with our data shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho600 ] ( right ) .",
    "the high - temperature peak belongs to the bad - metal - to - good - metal transition at @xmath27 .",
    "it was mentioned in @xcite that the low - temperature hump at @xmath38 is also significant ; however , it does not belong to a phase transition .",
    "rather , it is a crossover temperature where the low-@xmath32 @xmath39 begins to follow a power - law behavior whose form will be discussed later .",
    "it is clear that other features ( e.g. , the minimum of @xmath37 ) might have been selected .",
    "however , the status of such `` characteristic temperatures '' is somewhat uncertain , and we need further evidence to suggest that the properties of the system undergo substantial changes at any of these points .    the continuous bad - metal - to - good - metal transition of cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 at @xmath36 is clearly seen in resistivity , susceptibility , and specific heat measurements .",
    "there is no magnetic ordering @xcite .",
    "x - ray scattering finds new bragg peaks , with an accompanying anomaly in the intensity of fundamental reflections .",
    "though at first it was tentatively described as a cubic - to - cubic phase transition , there is now evidence that the symmetry is lowered to tetragonal . however , the deviation from the cubic structure is quite small , only about 0.05% @xcite .",
    "evidence that a second phase transition occurs at ambient pressure at @xmath40",
    "( `` l '' stands for `` lower '' ) , was presented by hiroi et al @xcite .",
    "they present a magnified image of the @xmath22 versus @xmath32 plot which reveals a minute hysteresis loop of a few k width in this region .",
    "the transition has little effect on the resistivity , no known signature in the susceptibility , and the specific heat shows merely an anomaly which is two orders of magnitude weaker than the one associated with the 200k transition .",
    "clearer evidence comes from magnetoresistivity measurements which show that , after @xmath41 essentially vanishes by the time @xmath32 reaches 100k , it reappears and becomes quite anisotropic from 120k onwards . looking at the magnetoresistivity , it is plausible that the metallic state between 100k and 200k is different from that below 100k",
    ". thus cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 should have two good metallic phases in addition to the bad metal above @xmath33k .",
    "the first thermopower data @xcite are compatible with this scenario .",
    "whatever the nature of the second phase transition , it is very weak .",
    "x - ray diffraction shows an anomaly in the temperature dependence of the fundamental reflections , including a jump for 008 @xcite . a recent refinement @xcite yielded the suggestive picture of distorted tetrahedra with three unequal re  re distances on each triangular plaquette .",
    "the order of the bonds allows to define a bond chirality parameter for each triangle , and it turns out that the low-@xmath32 structure of cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 can be thought of as `` ferrochiral '' .",
    "thus the 120k transition involves a change of symmetry , but it is , strictly speaking , not symmetry breaking : it does not belong to a symmetry lowering ( i.e. , choosing a subgroup of the original symmetry group ) from the @xmath42 phase , but to replacing one symmetry element with another .",
    "this symmetry characterization is compatible with the idea that the transition at @xmath28 is of first order .",
    "it is not clear what really happens at either the @xmath27 or the @xmath28 phase transition ; in particular , whether there is an electronic order parameter coupled to the obvious structural ones . though the symmetry changes are marked , we should not forget that they are realized by quite minute @xcite .",
    "distortions of the high-@xmath32 cubic structure ; thus though both phase transitions are literally structural transitions , it is not obvious that the structural change is enough to explain the drastic changes in electrical properties .",
    "in other words , we still have to search for the concomitant change of the many - electron state , which might well be the primary phenomenon .",
    "the x - ray study indicates that the temperature dependence of the new bragg peaks is anomalously slow @xcite , which would be compatible with the idea that the structural order parameter is secondary , induced by some underlying electronic order parameter .",
    "re nqr and cd nmr reveal that the local environment of the re site looses trigonal symmetry at @xmath27 , and that the character of orbital fluctuations changes at @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "xps indicates that the @xmath12 bands are split at low @xmath32 @xcite . all the evidence points to significant rearrangement of the @xmath12 subbands , with consequent changes in their occupation , starting from @xmath27 , and continuing until well below @xmath28 .",

    "3.5gpa suffices to suppress the major structural phase transition at @xmath27 .",
    "the weak transition at @xmath28 seems more sensitive to pressure .",

    "we find a distinctive feature of the intermediate temperature range @xmath44 : it is where electrical properties are remarkably sensitive to pressure .",

    "undoubtedly one would find a @xmath48 contribution , but certainly not so large as to satisfy the kadowaki ",
    "woods relation .",
    "the pressure dependence of @xmath69 and @xmath64 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : a3 ] .",
    "a moderate increase in @xmath70 is compatible with increased electron ",
    "phonon interaction in a compressed lattice .",
    "we call attention to the fact that the pressure dependence of @xmath69 is quite weak , even at 2gpa we find less than 40@xmath35 cm .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the results of hiroi et al . who find an about sixfold increase in @xmath69 at 1.5gpa , and a twofold increase in @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite would agree that correlation , as manifested in @xmath71 , is weak at ambient pressure , but argue that its role is increasing at higher pressures .",
    "our pressure range is limited to 2gpa , but within this range , we do not detect a tendency towards heavy fermion behavior . obviously , there is sample dependence in the observed behavior ; we think that the weak pressure dependence of @xmath69 is an indication of the good quality of our samples .",
    "there is apparent difficulty in deciding what happens to the electronic structure below 200k .",
    "the difficulty may arise partly from trying to reduce everything to a single number , the enhancement factor of the effective density of states @xmath72 , which would then appear also as the enhancement of the thermal effective mass @xmath73 , and similarly also in the spin susceptibility , and the plasma frequency @xcite .",
    "much of the previous discussion relied on the idea that the structural transitions open pseudogaps in the spaghetti of @xmath12 subbands , and consequently @xmath74 is reduced @xcite .",
    "this seems to agree with the reduction in susceptibility @xcite , but makes it difficult to understand why the conductivity is substantially increased .",
    "one can argue @xcite that heavy carriers got eliminated , which at @xmath75 did not contribute to conductivity but rather acted as scatterers . removing narrow subbands from the vicinity of @xmath76 would mean that @xmath77 is reduced .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath78 , the knight shift and @xmath79 measured by @xmath80cd nmr are well described by assuming a reduced @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "however , high - resolution photoemission data were interpreted in terms of a low-@xmath32 enhancement of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "our thermopower measurements do not allow to infer @xmath77 . using the simplest picture of a correlated one - band model @xcite the thermopower",
    "@xmath81 measures the band asymmetry about @xmath76 rather than the density of states .",
    "our data are thus indicative of a strongly increasing asymmetry below 200k .",
    "we may envisage a heavy subband gradually crossing out from the vicinity of @xmath76 , which gives a strong contribution to @xmath82 .    a pressure  temperature phase diagram based on plotting the characteristic temperatures @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath31 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] .",
    "the last data point for @xmath28 at 1.2gpa is , as we have seen , rather tentavive ; in any case , @xmath28 is suppressed fast .",
    "this is in general agreement with a previous observation @xcite , but our critical pressure for @xmath28 is rather lower . in contrast , our @xmath27 vs pressure curve would lie above that found by hiroi et al @xcite .",
    "@xmath31 is always defined by the peak position of the broad maximum of @xmath37 .",
    "it is rather pressure - independent , and approximately coincides with the low-@xmath32 minimum of @xmath21 .",
    "we do not think it associated with a phase transition but it is nevertheless significant since it marks the crossover from a stable good metallic state into a fluctuating intermediate-@xmath32 state .",
    "we may think of it as the coherence temperature of the low-@xmath32 electronic structure .",
    "since we did not find the third normal metallic phase at 1.8gpa , we drew a dashed line to show that @xmath28 should drop to zero somewhere between 1.2 and 1.8 gpa . in principle , a line of first - order transitions could terminate at a critical point at some finite temperature , but the recent finding of a symmetry change at @xmath28 @xcite rules this out : the phase boundary has to continue down to @xmath2 .",
    "one may ask what our final answer is to the question whether cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 is a correlated electron system . recalling",
    "the conflicting inferred results for @xmath83 , we note that seeking the same enhancement factor in various quantities originates from the underlying picture of a one - band model .",
    "having many kinds of spin and orbital correlations ( or , alternatively , intra- and inter - subband correlations ) should allow a contradiction - free interpretation .",
    "the evidence from specific heat alone should suffice to say that cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 is a correlated system .",
    "the difficulty that the susceptibility at the same time decreases , may be resolved if we postulate that singlet intersite spin correlations can be induced by electron ",
    "electron interaction in a frustrated itinerant system ( a similar result was found for the trellis lattice @xcite ) .",
    "we presented resistivity and thermopower measurements on single crystal samples of cd@xmath0re@xmath0o@xmath1 under five different pressure values up to 2gpa , and used the data to analyze the phase diagram in the @xmath32@xmath3 plane .",
    "the pressure dependence of the thermopower shows that the wide temperature interval between the upper structural transition ( at ambient pressure @xmath33k ) and the coherence temperature @xmath50k is a regime of continuing rearrangement of the electronic structure .",
    "the cubic - to - tetragonal transition at 200k does not immediately lead to a stable low - temperature phase , but rather to a state with electronic and structural ambiguity .",
    "a particular manifestation of this behavior is the appearance of a second structural phase transition which , is however , confined to relatively low pressures ( @xmath84gpa ) , while the overall features of the system remain the same at higher pressures .",
    "our results indicate that both coupling to the lattice , and the strongly temperature dependent redistribution of the electrons over the @xmath12 orbital states ( or alternatively the @xmath12 subbands ) are important for understanding the behavior of this frustrated itinerant system .",

    "it may still turn out that individual atomic motions within the unit cell are relatively large , which would allow that the phase transitions are primarily structurally driven ( band  jahn  teller transitions ) .",
    "however , we take a different view .    since the lattice responds to the change in the electronic state , the transitions may be called band  jahn  teller transitions .",
    "when speaking rather of orbital order , we imply that the phenomenon is primarily driven by electron  electron interactions , and that it would happen even if we held the lattice fixed .",
