    "as an attractive physical layer technology for wireless communications , orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) has been applied in many wireless communication standards , due to its considerable high spectrum efficiency , high power efficiency , multipath delay spread tolerance , and immunity to the frequency selective fading channels  @xcite . however , one major drawback of ofdm is the high peak - to - mean envelope power ratio ( pmepr ) of transmitted ofdm signals .",
    "since the high power amplifier ( hpa ) utilized in ofdm systems has limited linear range , the ofdm signals with high pmepr will be seriously clipped and nonlinear distortion will be introduced , resulting in serious degradation of the bit error rate ( ber ) performance  @xcite . moreover , the high pmepr leads to the out - of - band radiation , which causes serious adjacent channel interferences  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to significantly improve the energy efficiency and reduce communication overhead of ofdm systems , it is necessary to reduce the pmepr of ofdm systems .",
    "one promising approach for the pmepr reduction in ofdm systems is to use golay complementary sequences as codewords  @xcite , which can be constructed by co - sets of the classical reed - muller codes  @xcite .",
    "the upper - bound of pmepr for the golay complementary sequences can be restricted to be less than @xmath8 , which means significant pmepr reduction for ofdm signals .",
    "however , the golay complementary sequences have extremely low code rate , which makes this coding approach impractical in ofdm systems .",
    "for example , the code rate of the @xmath0-qam golay complementary sequences constructed in  @xcite is @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath4 , respectively , where the code rate of code @xmath14 with length @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 bits / symbol  @xcite .",
    "moreover , when the length of the sequences increases , the code rate of golay complementary sequences turns to be extremely low .",
    "thus , the low code rate is the bottleneck of golay complementary sequences .",
    "the most important objective of the coding approach is to improve the code rate of golay complementary sequences , which means that more and more sequences with low pmepr should be constructed .",
    "therefore , researchers have proposed another type of sequences : near - complementary sequences , which generalize the golay complementary sequences , in order to improve the code rate with a slight loss on the pmepr performance @xcite .    as discussed above ,",
    "the near - complementary sequences are expected to produce more sequences than golay complementary sequences at the cost of an increase of the pmepr bound .",
    "thus , near - complementary sequences can offer low pmepr with satisfactory code rate , and they are promising to be implemented in ofdm systems for the pmepr reduction",
    ". the main objective of near - complementary sequences is to develop novel constructions of the near - complementary sequences to enlarge their family size .",
    "a framework for the construction of @xmath17-phase shift keying ( psk ) near - complementary sequences have been proposed in  @xcite , which can achieve low pmepr in ofdm systems . since @xmath17-quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) is more widely used in ofdm systems ,",
    "different constructions of @xmath0-qam near - complementary sequences have been proposed in  @xcite , and these @xmath0-qam near - complementary sequences can be utilized to significantly reduce the pmepr in ofdm systems .    in this paper , we propose a novel construction of @xmath0-qam near - complementary sequences to enlarge the family size of the @xmath0-qam near - complementary sequences .",
    "the family size of the newly constructed @xmath0-qam near - complementary sequences is @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the proposed @xmath0-qam near - complementary sequences satisfy that @xmath3 , which means a significant pmepr reduction in ofdm systems .",
    "furthermore , to our best knowledge , all existing researches have not proposed a construction of @xmath4-qam near - complementary sequences , which has been a difficult problem for years .",
    "therefore , we develop a novel construction of @xmath4-qam near - complementary sequences with a low pmepr upper - bound in this paper , and it is the first proven construction for the @xmath4-qam near - complementary sequences .",
    "two types of the proposed @xmath4-qam near - complementary sequences satisfy that @xmath18 or @xmath19 , respectively . with the proposed construction ,",
    "the family size of the newly constructed @xmath4-qam near - complementary sequences is @xmath7 .",
    "the contributions of this paper are as follows : ( 1 ) a novel construction of @xmath0-qam near - complementary sequences is proposed , and the family size of sequences with low pmepr can be enlarged with the help of the proposed construction .",
    "( 2 ) a construction of @xmath4-qam near - complementary sequences is proposed , which is the first proven construction for the @xmath4-qam near - complementary sequences .",
