    "black holes are expected to be common objects in the universe . at the classical level , they are described by the einstein field equations .",
    "the study of black holes by an initial value formulation of einstein s equations is a difficult problem , both from the analytic and numerical point of view .",
    "one of the most important open question regarding black holes is the weak cosmic censorship conjecture ( cf .",
    "@xcite and also the recent review @xcite ) : generic singularities of gravitational collapse are contained in black holes . the physical relevance of the concept of black holes depends on the validity of this conjecture .",
    "however , a general proof of the cosmic censorship conjecture lies outside the scope of present mathematical techniques .",
    "thus , it is only possible to prove it in some very restrictive cases such spherical symmetry @xcite or to find indirect evidence of its validity . in the obtaining of these indirect evidences ,",
    "a key role is played by the following three consequences of the weak cosmic censorship and the theory of black holes @xcite @xcite :    * every apparent horizon must be entirely contained within the black hole event horizon . *",
    "if matter satisfies the null energy condition ( i.e. if @xmath1 for all null @xmath2 ) , then the area of the event horizon of a black hole can not decrease in time . * all black holes eventually settle down to a final kerr black hole .",
    "from ( i)-(iii ) we can deduce the penrose inequality @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the area of the apparent horizon and @xmath5 is the total adm mass of the space - time .",
    "remarkably , the inequality involves only quantities which can be computed directly form the initial data .",
    "after considerable effort , the penrose inequality has been proved for time symmetric initial data @xcite@xcite , providing an important support for the validity of ( i)-(iii ) .",
    "the penrose inequality can be strengthened if we assume axial symmetry and take into account angular momentum .",
    "angular momentum is a conserved quantity in axially symmetric space - times , since it can be defined by a komar integral ( cf . @xcite and also @xcite ) . using this fact and ( i)-(iii ) we deduce the following inequality @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total angular momentum of the space - time .",
    "the inequality must hold for every axially symmetric , non singular , asymptotically flat initial data .",
    "the equality in must be achieved if and only if the data are slices of kerr .",
    "note that implies @xmath8    we can also obtain upper bounds for the total amount of gravitational radiation emitted by the system .",
    "the total energy radiated is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass of the final kerr black hole .",
    "since @xmath11 we have @xmath12 in contrast with and , the inequality involves the complete evolution of the initial data .",
    "no analytic proof is available so far for . on the other hand",
    "if the inequality fails for some initial data then , these data represent a counter example of weak cosmic censorship . beside the trivial example of kerr initial data",
    ", inequality has been only studied in the spinning bowen - york initial data ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the spinning bowen - york data @xcite are conformally flat and the second fundamental form is a explicit solution of the momentum constraint which contain the angular momentum of the data as a free parameter .",
    "the mass of the data has to be computed numerically by solving the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "remarkably , these data reach a limit in @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xmath15 @xmath13 reaches the upper limit only in the nonrotating case , since in this case the bowen - york data reduce to the schwarzschild data .",
    "@xmath14 can not reach the limit case @xmath16 because they are not slices of kerr for any choice of the free parameter @xmath7 , even when @xmath7 goes to infinity .",
    "it appears that the kerr metric admits no conformally flat slices ( in fact , in @xcite it has been shown that there does not exist axisymmetric , conformally flat foliations of the kerr spacetime that smoothly reduce , in the schwarzschild limit , to slices of constant schwarzschild time ) .",
    "it is rather easy to construct conformally flat data with smaller @xmath14 : take the conformal second fundamental form of bowen - york @xmath17 and add a solution of the momentum constraint @xmath18 such that it has no angular momentum and such that the square of the sum @xmath19 is bigger than the square of @xmath17 ( these solutions can be explicitly constructed using theorem 14 of @xcite ) .",
    "solve the hamiltonian constraint with respect to the new second fundamental form @xmath20 .",
    "then the new data will have bigger mass and equal angular momentum than the bowen - york one .",
    "it can be proved that it is not possible to reverse this argument to produce a data with bigger @xmath14 .",
    "because of this , one is tempted to believe that is the upper limit to all conformally flat initial data .",
    "we will see that this is not the case .    in order to test inequalities  in a sharper way",
    "than with the bowen - york data we need to construct data with higher @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to do this",
    ", it is natural to consider perturbations of the kerr initial data .",
    "however there are many ways to perturb the kerr initial data , and for each case we have to deal with the solvability of a nonlinear elliptic equation in order to get a solution of the constraints .",
    "we have found a remarkable simple way of solving this problem . in this article",
    "we describe the construction of a conformally flat initial data in which the second fundamental form is related to the kerr second fundamental form in a simple way",
    ". the second fundamental form will be an explicit solution of the momentum constraint with the following property : it is a conformal rescaling of the kerr second fundamental form .",
    "these new data can be interpreted as a conformally flat deformation of the kerr initial data .",
    "we find that for the new data @xmath21    we also find that the total energy radiated is smaller than the bowen - york one and satisfies the inequality .",
    "the initial data presented here is also relevant for the binary problem . in order to improve the reliability of the results found in @xcite it is necessary to explore other family of initial data to know whether these results depend or not on the specific data used ; that is , whether there exist physical properties of the wave form emitted by a binary system that are invariant under small changes on the data",
    ". it will be possible to measure only this kind of properties .",
    "recently , other families of initial data has been suggested ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite@xcite and @xcite @xcite for a kerr - schild type ) .",
    "the data constructed here is as simple as the standard bowen - york , they will be a good candidate for future test and comparison with other initial data .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : initial ] we construct a explicit solutions of the momentum constraint for conformally flat metrics such that they are conformal to the kerr second fundamental form .",
    "these solution are constructed in an invariant way , they will depend on a scalar function @xmath22 that can be explicitly calculated for the kerr initial data . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] we describe the numerical computations of sequences of initial data and study the @xmath14 and @xmath13 for increasing values of @xmath7 .",
    "we then numerically evolve these initial data to compute the total gravitational energy radiated to infinity in order to compare it with the bowen - york solution ( and the vanishing kerr data ) .",
    "finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the extension of our solution to the binary ( an multi ) black hole case .",
    "the standard conformal method for solving the constraints equations for maximal initial data is the following ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and the reference given there ) .",
    "we give a conformal metric @xmath23 and a symmetric trace free tensor @xmath24 such that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the covariant derivative with respect to @xmath27 .",
    "then , we solve the following equation for the conformal factor @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the ricci scalar of the metric @xmath27 and the indexes are moved with @xmath27 .",
    "the physical fields defined by @xmath32 and @xmath33 will satisfy the vacuum constraint equations .",
    "we need to prescribe appropriate boundary condition to equations ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) , we will come back to this point later on .",
    "remarkable simplifications on ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) occur when @xmath27 has a killing vector @xmath34 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath34 is hypersurface orthogonal and we define @xmath35 by @xmath36 .",
    "we analyze first the momentum constraint ( [ eq:1 ] ) ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) consider the following vector field @xmath37 @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the lie derivative with respect @xmath34 and @xmath40 is the volume element of @xmath23 .",
    "it follows that @xmath37 satisfies @xmath41 using the killing equation @xmath42 , the fact that @xmath34 is hypersurface orthogonal , ( i.e. ; it satisfies @xmath43 } \\ln \\eta$ ] ) and equations ( [ eq : j ] ) we conclude that the tensor @xmath44 is trace free and satisfies ( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "the square of @xmath45 can be written in terms of @xmath22 @xmath46    two facts are important .",
    "first , the function @xmath22 is arbitrary .",
    "in particular it does not depend on the metric @xmath23 .",
    "second , the extrinsic curvature of the kerr initial data ( in the boyer - lindquist coordinates ) has the form ( [ eq : axialpsi ] ) , and then it has a corresponding function @xmath47 .",
    "we can describe now the new data .",
    "let @xmath48 be the flat metric .",
    "take the function @xmath47 .",
    "define @xmath45 by ( [ eq : axialve ] ) and ( [ eq : axialpsi ] ) .",
    "solve ( [ eq:2 ] ) for the conformal factor with the appropriate boundary condition .",
    "we will obtain a conformally flat data with a extrinsic curvature that ` resemble ' the kerr extrinsic curvature .",
    "in other words , we use the function @xmath22 to construct out of the kerr extrinsic curvature a explicit solution of the momentum constraint ( [ eq:1 ] ) for flat metric .    in order to write the equations and the boundary conditions",
    "explicitly we introduce spherical coordinates @xmath49 , and write the metric in the form @xcite @xmath50 then , the hamiltonian constraint ( [ eq:2 ] ) reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the flat laplacian in the spherical coordinates @xmath49 and @xmath53 is the two - dimensional laplacian @xmath54 the killing vector is given by @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath58 and @xmath22 are almost free function .",
    "for @xmath58 we impose that is regular at the axis . also , in order to have solutions for equation ( [ eq:4 ] ) , we need to impose some global condition on @xmath58 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in our case , both condition are trivially satisfied since @xmath58 will be chosen to be zero .",

    "the total angular momentum of the data is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 is any closed two - surface which enclose the origin .",
    "this equation can be written in a remarkable simple form in terms of @xmath22 @xmath66    let us mention some examples .",
