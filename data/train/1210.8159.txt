    "i.e.   restricting all considerations to the category of finite - dimensional @xmath22-modules , projective modules also satisfy the dual property of being injective .",
    "one could then replace our previous definition by the requirement that any projective submodule @xmath56 of an arbitrary module @xmath60 always appears as a direct summand .",
    "let @xmath61 denote the set of ( equivalence classes of ) all finite dimensional simple modules .",
    "elements from this set will be denoted by @xmath62 , with @xmath63 running through some set of weights .",
    "we split the weights into typical ones and atypical ones , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . to each weight @xmath63 , one can associate precisely one simple module @xmath62 and further indecomposable modules which contain @xmath62 as a simple quotient .",
    "the most important of these modules is the projective cover @xmath66 .",
    "a representation @xmath62 is typical if and only if @xmath67 . a further example would be the kac module @xmath68 .",
    "another important module , even though not indecomposable , is the module @xmath69 which is induced from a finite dimensional simple @xmath70-module @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 is projective since @xmath71 is projective and hence it possesses a decomposition @xmath73 into projective covers .",
    "due to the relation @xmath74 , the multiplicities can be obtained as the dimension @xmath75 of a suitable space of @xmath22-homomorphisms .",
    "finally we introduce an equivalence relation on the set @xmath61 .",
    "two weights @xmath63 and @xmath76 are said to be in the same block if there exists a non - split extension @xmath77 in other words , if @xmath62 and @xmath78 can be obtained as a submodule and a quotient of @xmath79 , respectively , but nevertheless @xmath79 is different from @xmath80 .",

    ", a lie supergroup @xmath16 is a fermionic extension of an ordinary lie group @xmath83 by fermionic coordinates which transform in a suitable representation of @xmath83 .",
    "all the properties of a supergroup are inherited from these data .",
    "for this reason , we will review the well - known harmonic analysis on ordinary compact lie groups first .",
    "the goal of harmonic analysis is to learn about the structure of a manifold from studying the action of differential operators  lie derivatives and laplace operators  on its algebra of functions .",
    "let us consider a compact , simple , simply - connected lie group @xmath83 . according to the peter - weyl theorem",
    ", the algebra @xmath84 of square integrable functions on @xmath83 ( with respect to the haar measure ) decomposes as @xmath85 under the left - right regular action @xmath86 of @xmath87 , where the sum is over all finite dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath83 .",
    "each individual term in the decomposition can be thought of as being associated with representation matrices @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",
    "the statement of the peter - weyl theorem is that these matrix elements can be used to approximate any function on @xmath83 with arbitrary precision .",
    "the extension to supergroups is straightforward .",
    "compared to an ordinary group , a supergroup comes with additional grassmann algebra valued coordinates which generate the exterior algebra @xmath90 .",
    "this space admits an obvious action of @xmath70 by the lie bracket or , equivalently , by conjugation with elements from @xmath91 .",
    "the algebra of functions on the supergroup @xmath16 is the induced module ( with respect to the right action of @xmath83 ) @xmath92 this definition has a natural interpretation arising from formally expanding functions on @xmath16 in a taylor series in the odd coordinates .",
    "apart from the right action of @xmath16 , @xmath93 also admits a left action , just as in the bosonic case . our goal is to understand the decomposition of this algebra as a @xmath94-module ( with respect to the left and right regular action ) .",
    "the result will provide a super - analogue of the peter - weyl theorem .",
    "since all finite dimensional representations of a reductive lie algebra @xmath70 are projective the same will be true for the induced module @xmath93 .",
    "hence , as a right @xmath22-module , @xmath93 has the decomposition @xmath95 where the sum is over all projective covers of @xmath22 and the @xmath96 are some multiplicity spaces . as a left @xmath22-module",
    ", @xmath93 has precisely the same decomposition .",
    "indeed , the algebra of functions has to be isomorphic with respect to the left and the right regular action due to the existence of the isomorphism @xmath97 which acts as @xmath98 and which intertwines the left and right regular actions .",
    "in the typical sector , @xmath66 agrees with @xmath62 .",
    "given the symmetry between the left and the right action it is then obvious that @xmath99 as vector spaces .",
    "we will now show that this is indeed always the case , not only in the typical sector but also in the atypical sector .",
    "first of all we notice that , by definition and eq .  , the algebra of functions on @xmath16 has the form @xmath100 as a @xmath101-module .",
    "we then employ frobenius reciprocity to rewrite eq .   as @xmath102 which proves our assertion , given that all @xmath70-modules are fully reducible .",
    "the result just obtained suggests that we have a factorization @xmath103 of the individual contributions in the typical sector , just as in the case of @xmath84 . in the atypical sector , however , such a factorization is not possible since the projective covers @xmath66 are strictly larger than the simple modules @xmath62 .",
    "for this reason , the left and right modules in the atypical sector are entangled in a complicated way , arranging themselves in infinite dimensional non - chiral indecomposable @xmath94-modules @xmath104}$ ] for each individual _ block _ @xmath81 $ ] .",

    "for lie supergroups of type i this has been worked out in great detail in @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized that the laplace operator is not diagonalizable on the atypical projective covers @xmath66 and on the non - chiral modules @xmath104}$ ] . for @xmath0-models on supergroups",
    "this implies that they are generally logarithmic conformal field theories .",

    "0cm0.2cm13cm2 cm    0.90.9      since our previous result has been very abstract , let us explain it in more detail using the example of @xmath106 ( first considered in @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding lie superalgebra @xmath107 has two cartan elements @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "consequently , states in a module are labeled by two numbers @xmath110 , the eigenvalues of @xmath108 and @xmath109 . since @xmath108 is central , the value @xmath111 merely plays the role of a spectator . for @xmath112",
    "the state sits in an atypical representation , otherwise in a typical one .",
    "typical representations @xmath113 ( with @xmath114 ) are two - dimensional while atypical simple modules @xmath115 are one - dimensional . on the other hand ,",
    "the projective cover @xmath116 of the atypical simple module @xmath115 is four - dimensional , having a composition series @xmath117 .",
    "the most important features of the harmonic analysis on @xmath106 are sketched in figure [ fig : gl ] . in the typical sector , the states organize themselves into two - dimensional representations , both with respect to the left and with respect to the right action ( red and green lines ) . under the combined action they combine into four - dimensional representations ( red and green boxes ) which correspond to the tensor product of two representations . in the atypical sector , however , the picture is very different . here",
    "the states organize themselves in four - dimensional projective covers if only one of the two actions is considered ( red and green lines ) .",
    "one should imagine a diamond which is perpendicular to the plane , with two of the vertices being located in the plane .",
    "in this case the states can not be organized in a tensor product under the combined action for obvious reasons .",
    "instead they have to combine into infinite dimensional indecomposable multiplets ( blue ) , one for each value of @xmath118 .",
    "the harmonic analysis on a supercoset @xmath17 where the supergroup elements are identified according to the rule @xmath13 with @xmath15 can be immediately deduced from that of the supergroup case .",
    "indeed , the algebra of functions on @xmath17 can be thought of as the space of @xmath20-invariant functions on @xmath16 , @xmath119 where an element @xmath30 of the supergroup @xmath20 acts on @xmath120 according to @xmath121 it is obvious that the space @xmath17 and hence also the algebra of functions @xmath122 still admits an action of @xmath16 .",
    "the isometry supergroup of @xmath17 might be bigger than @xmath16 but for simplicity we will only consider the symmetry @xmath16",
    ".    writing the invariant subspace explicitly as a direct sum over indecomposable @xmath16-modules turns out to be rather involved in the general case .",
    "the main reason is that the modules over lie superalgebras are not fully decomposable . on the one hand such modules already appear in @xmath93 , as @xmath16-modules with respect to the right regular action ,",
    "see eq .  .",
    "on the other hand , they may also arise when decomposing simple @xmath16-modules after restricting the action to the supergroup @xmath20 .",
    "finally , the invariants that need to be extracted when restricting from @xmath93 to @xmath122 can be either true @xmath20-invariants of @xmath93 ( i.e. simple @xmath20-modules ) or they can sit in a larger indecomposable @xmath20-module .",
    "a general solution to this intricate problem is currently beyond reach .",
    "nevertheless we can state one general lesson : in case @xmath20 is purely bosonic",
    "the algebra of functions @xmath122 will necessarily involve projective covers of simple @xmath16-modules .",
    "in particular , this observation is relevant for the supercosets describing @xmath123 backgrounds in string theory , see table [ tab : strings ] .",
    "the problem sketched in the previous paragraph can be circumvented when working on the level of characters since these are not sensitive to the indecomposable structure of modules . for our purposes",
    "this will be sufficient .      instead of treating the general case ,",
    "we discuss one example in some detail , namely the supersphere @xmath2 .",
    "this supersphere can be thought of as being embedded into the flat superspace @xmath124 , i.e.  we have four bosonic coordinates @xmath125 and two fermionic coordinates @xmath126 subject to the constraint @xmath127 . for our purposes",
    "we can identify the algebra of functions @xmath128 with the polynomial algebra in the six coordinates @xmath129 modulo the ideal @xmath130 .",
    "these coordinates transform in the vector representation of @xmath131 and the defining representation of @xmath132 , respectively .",
    "moreover , these transformations leave the constraint invariant . in addition , one can consider transformations which mix bosons and fermions .",
    "the resulting supergroup of isometries is @xmath1 .",
    "since the stabilizer of an arbitrary point on @xmath2 is @xmath133 , this confirms that the supersphere possesses a representation as a supercoset @xmath134 ( cf .",
    "table [ tab : condmat ] ) .    in order to determine the character for the @xmath1-module @xmath128 we proceed as follows .",
    "we first identify the cartan subalgebra of @xmath135 with the cartan subalgebra of @xmath136 , where we use the identification @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we then choose linear combinations of the six coordinates such that we can assign the weights @xmath139 and @xmath140 to them , with @xmath141 .",
    "in addition we introduce a quantum number for the polynomial grading .",
    "each of the six coordinates @xmath142 then contributes a term @xmath143 to the character , where @xmath144 have to be chosen according to the respective weights and @xmath145 keeps track of the polynomial grade . for a product of coordinates ,",
    "these individual contributions have to be multiplied with each other since the quantum numbers and the polynomial degree add up .",
    "after these preparations it is very simple to write down the character of all polynomial functions in the coordinates @xmath142 .",
    "dividing out the ideal @xmath130 is taken into account by multiplying the previous character with @xmath146 since the constraint relates singlets at polynomial degree @xmath147 to singlets at polynomial degree @xmath148 . at the end",
    "we take the limit @xmath149 since the grade is not a good quantum number once we impose the constraint .",
