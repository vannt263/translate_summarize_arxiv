    "since the discovery of fullerene c@xmath4 @xcite various research activities on alternative fullerene structures of carbon materials have flourished due to their noble physical properties and potential applications as next generation electronic devices .",
    "the smallest fullerene c@xmath0 has been actively studied after its first successful production by prinzbach et al .  @xcite .",
    "although there have been many theoretical predictions on its intriguing properties such as superconductivity , @xcite vibrational modes , @xcite and transport @xcite along the line of fullerene - based molecular electronics , @xcite c@xmath0 has been a challenge for theorists since long before its experimental synthesis .",
    "for instance , the stable structural configuration of c@xmath0 has not been clearly understood .",
    "the effort to determine the stable structure and relative stability of c@xmath0 isomers , e.g. , ring , bowl , and cage , has raised a question on the contribution of electron correlation energy to the structural stability@xcite .",
    "one of the difficulties in predicting the most stable c@xmath0 isomer lies in the treatment of the exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy .",
    "it was shown that density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations gave qualitatively different results depending on the xc functional such as local density approximation ( lda ) , generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , and hatree - fock ( hf ) .",
    "even the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) results were different from lda , gga , hf and hybrid dft@xcite .",
    "the prediction of the ground state atomic structure of fullerene c@xmath0 has suffered the similar problem .",
    "the high symmetry @xmath2 structure of the c@xmath0 cage is known to be unstable with respect to the jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion . according to galli et al .",
    "@xcite , both lda and gga predicted @xmath3 as the symmetry of the most stable jahn - teller distorted cage structure , which is consistent with the tight - binding molecular - dynamics ( tbmd ) result by yamamoto et al .",
    "@xcite . however , the hybrid dft calculation by saito and miyamoto @xcite determined c@xmath5 to be the most stable one , while @xmath6 or @xmath7 were chosen by the hf calculations@xcite .",
    "sometimes even the same kind of calculations made by different groups have given different predictions ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as grossman et al",
    ". pointed out , this small molecular carbon system , c@xmath0 , demonstrates the importance of the highly accurate treatment of electron correlations@xcite .",
    "recently lin et al .",
    "@xcite took a different perspective to this issue . by considering the fullerene c@xmath0 as a superatom with 20 valence electrons",
    ", they set up a tight binding model taking account of the strong hybridization of @xmath8-orbitals with @xmath9 , which arises from the extreme curvature of the c@xmath0 cage .",
    "expecting the important role of the on - site coulomb interaction , they carried out qmc and exact diagonalization ( ed ) calculations for the hubbard model hamiltonian for c@xmath0 . as a result",
    ", it was found that c@xmath0 with both @xmath2 and @xmath3 structures undergoes a magnetic - to - non - magnetic and non - magnetic - to - magnetic transitions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , as @xmath10 increases@xcite .    to investigate the effect of the on - site coulomb interaction in connection with its ground state atomic and magnetic structures",
    ", we performed lda+@xmath1 and gga+@xmath1 calculations @xcite and calculated optimized structure under the symmetry constraint of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "our result showed that the non - magnetic @xmath3 structure is more stable than magnetic @xmath2 for small values of @xmath1 less than 4 ev regardless of the choice of the xc functionals , which is consistent with previous works @xcite .",
    "when @xmath11 ev , the lda@xmath12 calculations predict a magnetic state with @xmath13 to be a ground state , which is different from gga@xmath12 .",
    "this result indicates that there are subtleties in the competition between the jahn - teller structural instability and the magnetic instability enhanced by coulomb correlations .",
    "further the dependence on the exchange - correlation functionals suggests the importance of electron correlation effects in determination of the c@xmath0 ground state .",
    "in order to describe on - site coulomb interactions for the carbon @xmath14 orbitals , which are relatively localized in a small - sized cluster like c@xmath0 , we employed the lda@xmath12 ( gga@xmath12 ) method @xcite . in our lda@xmath12 ( gga@xmath12 )",
    "approach , the total energy functional is written as @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lda ( gga ) energy functional and @xmath17 is given by a spherically averaged screened - coulomb energy @xmath1 and an exchange energy @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the spin index , @xmath21 with the site index @xmath22 , the angular momentum quantum number @xmath23 , and the multiplicity number of the radial basis function @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is an eigenvalue of the occupation number matrix . here",
    "the @xmath1- and the @xmath18-values are assumed to depend only on the index @xmath26 , but to be independent of the azimuthal quantum number @xmath27 , which is regarded as a simplification of the hartree - fock theory by using a spherical average . the double - counting term @xmath28 can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 reads @xmath33 and it is the term that describes the on - site coulomb interactions .",
    "the effective @xmath1-value , defined by @xmath34 , can be treated as a numerical parameter , and it is clear from eq .",
    "( 4 ) that lda@xmath12 ( gga@xmath12 ) method is equivalent to lda ( gga ) in @xmath35 limit .",
    "we used the previously proposed ` dual ' representation @xcite , which is proven to be successful for various materials @xcite .",
    "we considered the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath1 for the carbon @xmath14 orbitals , which are relatively localized in a small - sized cluster like c@xmath0 . in our lda@xmath12 and gga@xmath12 calculations , we used the previously proposed ` dual ' representation @xcite , which is proven to be successful for various materials @xcite .",
    "we performed cluster calculations based on the dft by employing a linear - combination - of - localized - pseudo - atomic orbitals ( lcpao ) as a basis set .",
    "ceperley - alder @xcite and perdew - burke - ernzerh @xcite type exchange - correlation energy functional were adopted for lda and gga calculation , respectively .",
    "we used double valence orbitals as a basis set which were generated by a confinement potential scheme with the cutoff radius of 5.0 a.u .. troullier - martins type pseudo - potentials with a partial core correction were used to replace the deep core potentials by norm - conserving soft potentials in a factorized separable form with multiple projectors .",
    "the real space grid techniques were used with the energy cutoff of 160 ry in numerical integrations and the solution of the poisson equation using fast fourier transformations ( fft ) .",
    "in addition , the projector expansion method was employed to accurately calculate three - center integrals associated with the deep neutral atom potential with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "all the dft calculations were performed using our dft openmx code@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : c20_mo ] shows a schematic diagram of the hckel s molecular orbital levels around the fermi energy for the magnetic @xmath38 and the jahn - teller ( jt ) distorted @xmath3 structure of fullerene c@xmath0 . in the highly symmetric @xmath38 structure , the highest - occupied - molecular - orbital ( homo )",
    "states are four - fold degenerate and partially filled by two valence electrons . due to the electronic degeneracy ,",
    "the @xmath38 structure c@xmath0 is jahn - teller active and can undergo a structural distortion .",
    "consequently the jahn - teller distorted @xmath3 structure leads to a finite gap in between the homo level and the lowest - unoccupied - molecular - orbital ( lumo ) states .",
    "since the homo state is occupied by a singlet pair , the @xmath3 ground state becomes non - magnetic . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath2 c@xmath0 ground state can be magnetic due to a kind of the hund s rule coupling present in this ` superatom ' , where the magnetic exchange energy between the homo electrons favors the magnetically aligned spin state of the undistorted @xmath2 structure .    the calculated density - of - states ( dos ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos - both ] clearly shows the different electronic structure of these two structures .",
    "the dotted blue and solid red lines correspond to the @xmath39 and @xmath40 ev calculation , respectively . the fermi level of @xmath38 c@xmath0 is located at the middle of a majority spin peak ( fig .",

    "[ fig : dos - both](b ) ) , which is consistent with the hckel s molecular orbital pictures in fig .",
    "[ fig : c20_mo ] .",
    "while the electronic states of the jt - distorted @xmath3 structure are hardly affected by the change of on - site @xmath1 values from 0 to 2 ev , the exchange split of the undistorted @xmath2 structure is significantly enhanced even for the moderate on - site interaction of @xmath1= 2 ev . considering the enhanced exchange interactions , we tried to explore a possible contribution of the on - site coulomb interactions to the stabilization of the magnetic @xmath2 structure over that of the jt structural distortion .",
    "figure  [ fig : evsu ] shows the calculated total energies by lda@xmath12 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evsu](a ) ) and gga@xmath12 ( fig .",

    ", we also calculated the total energies of the non - magnetic ( nm ) phase of @xmath2 .",
    "the total energies of fm-@xmath38 , nm-@xmath38 , and nm-@xmath3 are represented by the dotted grey , dotted blue , and solid red lines , respectively .",
    "the total energy of fm-@xmath38 is set at zero as a reference .",
    "for the both lda and gga calculations with @xmath39 , the nm-@xmath3 configuration was found to be the ground state and the nm-@xmath38 configuration is the highest in energy , which is consistent with the jt structural instability of @xmath2 discussed above .",
    "gga predicts the larger stability of the non - magnetic nm-@xmath3 over the magnetic fm-@xmath2 .",
    "the stabilization energy of the nm-@xmath3 over fm-@xmath38 and nm-@xmath38 is 239 and 374 mev , in lda , whereas 821 and 998 mev in gga , , respectively .",
    "( see the table  [ table ] for detailed information . )",
    "the relative order of stability among the different configurations remains the same even with @xmath40 ev .",
    "it is noted that the @xmath3 structure is more stabilized over @xmath38 in gga calculation than in lda for both @xmath39 and 2 ev ; the stabilization energy is more than three times larger than in lda . with a larger coulomb interaction parameter , @xmath41 ev",
    ", the total energy differences between fm-@xmath2 and nm-@xmath3 are dramatically reduced for both lda@xmath12 and gga@xmath12 results .",
    "indeed , in the case of lda@xmath12 , the ground state is changed from the nm-@xmath3 to the fm-@xmath2 configuration as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evsu ] .",
    "this result implies that , when @xmath1 becomes large , the magnetic energy gain with an enhance exchange interaction can stabilize the symmetric @xmath38 structure against the jahn - teller distortion with a lower symmetry @xmath3 structure .",
    "the strong on - site coulomb interactions enhance the electron localization , which leads to the exchange energy gain thereby contributing to the stabilization of the undistorted structure .",
    "figure  [ fig : cd - diff ] shows a charge density difference between @xmath40 and @xmath39 of fm-@xmath38 .",
    "the blue and red colors represent the electron surplus regions of the @xmath40 and @xmath39 ev calculations , respectively . though the magnitude of the charge difference is small , the difference plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : cd - diff ] demonstrates the tendency of electron localization at each carbon site , which arises from the electron correlation due to the on - site coulomb interactions .",
    "the effect of the electron localization can affect the relatively enhanced exchange coupling among the degenerate homo states , and its magnitude seems to be comparable to that of the jt distortion . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos - both ] , it is shown that the jt level spacing in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos - both](b ) is comparable to that of the exchange splitting in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos - both](a ) . since the jt distortion lifts up the orbital degeneracy of the homo states , the jt mechanism acts against the formation of magnetic moment in fullerene c@xmath0 .",
    "this result is another example demonstrating the discrepancy caused by the different xc energy functionals , and further is consistent with the previous studies @xcite which emphasized that the structural ground state depend on the type of xc energy functionals .",
    "it is interesting to compare our lda@xmath12 and gga@xmath12 calculation results with the recent hubbard - model - based study by lin et al .",
    "@xcite . starting from an observation that the hopping parameter @xmath42 of the c@xmath0 fullerene should be much smaller than that of c@xmath4 but its on - site repulsion @xmath1 remains the same , which means that the ratio of @xmath10 is large , they assumed that electron correlations play an important role in this system and performed ed and qmc calculation for one - band hubbard model parameterized by @xmath10 , @xmath43 their results predicted that the ground state of the @xmath2 structure changes from triplet to singlet at about @xmath44 , while the ground state of @xmath3 evolves from the singlet ( non - magnetic ) state at @xmath39 to a triplet state for @xmath10 larger than 0.5 , and then transit to a singlet state again at @xmath45 .",
    "those predictions based on the model analysis are in contradiction to our dft calculations , where the fm state of the @xmath2 structure is always stable relative to the nm @xmath2 state and the jt distorted @xmath3 structure prefers a non - magnetic ground state .",
    "the main difference between the hubbard model approach and our dft calculations lies on that our dft calculations take account of the exchange coupling among the electrons occupying the homo states .",
    "the explicit treatment of the degenerate homo states is crucial since the energetic competition between the exchange coupling and the jt structural distortion is crucial for the degenerate states .",
    "we investigated the effect of on - site coulomb correlations on the structural and magnetic properties of the fullerene c@xmath0 by carrying out the lda@xmath12 and gga@xmath12 calculations . from the comparison of the total energies of the magnetic @xmath2 structure and the jt - distorted @xmath3 structure for different values of the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath1",
    ", we suggest that the exchange - coupling driven magnetic instability can possibly override the jahn - teller structural distortion at least for the value of @xmath41 ev within the lda@xmath12 calculations . considering the subtle dependence of the ground state properties of c@xmath0 on the choice of xc - functional forms as well as the hubbard model parameters ,",
    "more elaborate calculations are required to resolve the physical picture for the ground state of the fullerene c@xmath0 , where the magnetic instability due to the coulomb correlation effect competes with the structural distortion in the ` superatom ' fullerene c@xmath0 .",
