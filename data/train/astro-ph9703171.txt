    "c - type shocks are frequently invoked to interpret the signatures of accelerated and excited gas in molecular clouds .",
    "these magnetically - mediated , two - fluid shocks are able to explain the survival of the molecules in shocks with velocities exceeding 20kms@xmath0 as well as the low excitation of observed spectra ( e.g. the strong atomic fine - structure lines of oxygen and the low values of the 2 - 1 s(1)/1 - 0 s(1 ) ratio of molecular hydrogen ) . however , several basic questions on the existence of c - shocks remain to be answered . under what conditions",
    "do steady - state c - shocks form ?",
    "is there sufficient time for the various c - shock configurations to be realized ?",
    "alternatively , how can we recognize an incomplete or proto - c - shock ? here , as part of a wider program to investigate supersonic ambipolar diffusion , we develop a numerical model and apply it to study the time - dependence of planar c - shock configurations .    a theory for steady c - shocks in molecular gas",
    "was constructed by draine ( 1980 ) and applied by draine , roberge & dalgarno ( 1983 ) .",
    "the combination of low ion fraction , strong cooling , and significant ( but not high ) magnetic field results in a shock in which ion - neutral drag provides the viscosity , cooling keeps the gas supersonic and the field via the ions provides an extended cushioning layer which inhibits molecular dissociation ( draine & mckee 1993 ) .",
    "steady solutions for transverse - field c - shocks were further analysed by chernoff ( 1987 ) , roberge & draine ( 1990 ) and smith & brand ( 1990a ) .",
    "smith , brand & moorhouse ( 1991 ) looked at the high - field ` shock absorbers ' .",
    "wardle & draine ( 1987 ) & smith ( 1993a , b ) presented a theory for oblique - field c - shocks , including the parallel - field c - switches .",
    "flower , pineau des forts & hartquist ( 1985 ) considered the chemical aspects of steady c - shocks , work which has developed into a theory for c - shock chemistry ( see flower et al 1996 ) .",
    "predictions for steady , planar c - shocks were presented , in addition , by smith & brand ( 1990b ) , smith ( 1991 , 1995 ) and kaufman & neufeld ( 1996a , b ) .    are these steady - state predictions relevant ? there are two other possibilities : instability and evolution",
    ". instability has been investigated by wardle ( 1990 , 1991a , b ) , toth ( 1994,1995 ) and now by stone ( 1997 ) and mac low & smith ( 1997a , b ) .",
    "conditions for stability are either ( i ) neutral alfven numbers @xmath4 = v@xmath5/v@xmath6 @xmath7 , where v@xmath5 and v@xmath6 = b /@xmath8 are the shock and alfvn speeds , respectively , or ( ii ) rapid recombination so that the ion fraction is fixed locally rather than via advection .",
    "however , it is not clear that the steady state is approached even in the absence of instability .",
    "this evolutionary question , which has not been examined before ( pineau des forts 1997 ) , is the focus of this paper .",
    "furthermore , we predict the speed and character of changes in emission line strengths that identify a proto - c - shock , and distinguish these changes from those produced in an unstable c - shock ( as evaluated by neufeld & stone ( 1997 ) and mac low & smith ( 1997b ) ) .",
    "our attempt to evolve flow patterns from a sharply discontinuous j - shock to a c - shock under constant ionization conditions may not exactly correspond to a physical situation .",
    "rather , we use these examples to envisage how a flow accomodates to changing conditions such as those caused by the start of a stellar outflow , the impact of a jet on a cloud , or a cloud - cloud collision .",
    "our primary goal here is to obtain a deeper understanding of how molecular shocks behave dynamically .",
    "we do use an alternative initial condition , with a smooth transition following a hyperbolic tangent function , to test the dependence of our results on the assumption of an initially sharp discontinuity .",
    "this paper also represents one step in our exploration of supersonic ambipolar diffusion .",
    "the original zeus ambipolar diffusion code of mac low et al ( 1995 ) has been extended to cover more general molecular cloud conditions , by including ion mass conservation as opposed to the ealier assumption of a fixed ion number density .",
    "hence it is first necessary to test the behavior of the extended code against standard c - shock solutions (  2 ) .",
    "the fluid remains as before isothermal .",
    "we thus concentrate on the dynamical aspects .",
    "the ` cool c - shock approximation ' ( smith & brand 1990a ) allows us to extract quantitative predictions for temperature and line emission .",
    "for our numerical computations , we use a modified version of the zeus code ( stone & norman 1992a , b ) .",
    "ambipolar diffusion was added to zeus by mac low et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who described the basic interface with the zeus code . summarizing , that work made four approximations : isothermality of ions , electrons and neutrals , no electron - ion drift , ion density dependent in power - law fashion on neutral density , and no ion inertia or pressure .",
    "this allowed us to neglect , respectively , the energy equation , ohmic diffusion , and the equations of ion mass and momentum conservation .",
    "this approach has proved adequate for modelling protostellar disks in the absence of strong shocks .",
    "however , the flow of ions can be important in c - shocks , for example in the wardle instability , which is driven by the flow of ions along buckling field lines in the shock front .",
    "neglect of ion inertia and pressure had allowed the replacement of the ion momentum conservation equation by an algebraic equation expressing the balance between lorentz forces and ion - neutral drag in determining the drift velocity between ions and neutrals .",
    "this approach is physically accurate and allows time steps determined by the equivalent of the courant condition for ambipolar diffusion , @xmath9 ( mac low et al .",
    "1995 ) . both tth ( 1994 ) and",
    "we have found that this approach can be numerically unstable in the presence of steep velocity gradients as occur in c - shocks .",
    "however , in the one - dimensional models shown in this paper , this only occurs for switch shocks , and even there is not deadly to the computation , so we defer addressing this issue to our report on multi - dimensional models ( mac low & smith 1997b ) .",
    "we treat the ions as a separate fluid in the code , using the standard zeus algorithms to update them .",
    "the equations we solve in the current version of the code are then the neutral and ion continuity equations , the neutral momentum equation , and the induction equation , as well as satisfying the zero - divergence criterion : @xmath10 where the subscripts @xmath11 and @xmath12 refer to the ions and neutrals , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are density , velocity and pressure for each fluid , @xmath16 is the magnetic field , and @xmath17 is the collisional coupling constant between the ions and neutrals .",
    "we used the analytic jump conditions for a magnetized shock ( e.g.priest 1982 ) to set the values of the flow variables on both boundaries needed to hold the shock stationary on our grid . these are traditionally called ` inflow ' boundary conditions , although on the downstream edge of our grid the flow is out rather than in .",
    "we begin by setting up a one - dimensional j - shock .",
    "we generated this solution from the standard shock jump conditions with magnetic field ( e.g. priest 1982 ) .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the ion fraction was initially high , forcing the ions and neutrals to move at identical velocity .",
    "given the shock speed , alfvn speed , temperature and field direction , we can define the downstream values in terms of the upstream values .",
    "the supersonic inflow and subsonic outflow boundary conditions are then set so that the shock front remains stationary on the computational grid .",
    "note that the shock front thus begins as a truly discontinuous jump rather than being spread out by numerical viscosity .",
    "we also use an initial condition with a smooth transition proportional to tanh(x / l ) for a given l to check the importance of the initial discontinuity .",

    "the neutral and ion compression ratios are @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . assuming ion conservation and isothermality ,",

    "in which the ion abundance is a constant , the momentum conservation condition is unaltered and the drag relation is then @xmath47 full steady - state solutions are derived by numerically solving these simple differential equations to any desired accuracy .",
    "besides the length scale @xmath48 , we define the ion deceleration scale @xmath49 .",
    "a further scale defines the ion - neutral interaction region . in cool shocks",
    ", the maximum streaming speed occurs for @xmath50 ( on putting t = 0 in equation [ moment ] ) .",
    "the value of the maximum is @xmath51 .",
    "it follows that high streaming speeds are maintained over a length scale @xmath52 .",
    "finally note that the length scale defined by wardle ( 1990 , 1991a , b ) is @xmath53 .",
    "we define here what proves to be a better measure of the shock length for transverse shocks : @xmath54 .",
    "this enables low @xmath4 shocks to be also included    the time - dependent shock flow pattern is fully determined by four control parameters : the alfvn number @xmath4 , the mach number @xmath55 , the ion fraction and the initial field orientation .",
    "these are the only parameters which remain after scaling equations ( 15 ) to the length scale @xmath48 and the time scale @xmath56 .",
    "therefore only one parameter is necessary to describe the whole class of transverse , low - ionisation , cold flows : a single flow simulation with a fixed alfvn number is relevant to a wide range of conditions .",
    "one must , however , ensure that the thermal pressure gradients remain small .",
    "this is easily achievable when close to the steady state since then the pressure gradient term @xmath57 is limited by the maximum compression ( @xmath58 for high @xmath4 ) to the value ( @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the sound speed .",
    "this is expected to be well below unity ( and therefore ignorable ) in strong shocks in molecular clouds . however , in time - dependent flows in general , depending on the imposed conditions , neutral speeds may approach zero and even an isothermal flow may possess high pressure gradients .",
    "the present simulations then require holding both the mach and alfvn numbers fixed .",
    "furthermore , the freedom to scale parameters while holding @xmath4 fixed becomes physically invalid if the ion fraction depends on the other shock parameters .",
    "this limits the scaling regime to flows with ion - neutral streaming speeds less than @xmath61 42 kms@xmath0 to avoid runaway ionisation ( draine et al 1983 , smith & brand 1990a ) .",
    "the flow patterns presented below can thus be considered quite general provided the above rules are not violated .",
    "no scaling was attempted , however , when calculating the emission line properties , in order to avoid possible mis - matching when piecing together the results from separate models for the emission from the j - shock and the continuous section .      in our time - dependent computations , j - shocks",
    "indeed evolve to the analytical , steady c - shock solution to within our numerical accuracy .",
    "figure  [ p1_stead ] presents the flow parameters at a time @xmath62s .",
    "the length scale is @xmath48 = 1.310@xmath63 cm and the flow time scale is @xmath64 = @xmath65 = @xmath66s .",
    "we find that it takes several flow time scales before the flow pattern finally settles down to the analytical steady state solution .",
    "figure  [ p1_error ] demonstrates the dependence of the time - dependent solutions on the grid resolution .",
    "even a grid size of r@xmath67 = 50 , with the number of zones across the shock r = @xmath68 = 13 , is sufficient for dynamical purposes with the major error occurring in the final deceleration zone ( at about 310@xmath63 cm ) .",

    "we identify four stages in the evolution from a j - shock to a c - shock .",
    "each stage lasts approximately 10 times longer than the previous one .",
    "* stage 1 involves rapid ion motions .",
    "it is characterised by high - speed , ion - magnetosonic wave motions over a short time . during the first @xmath72s , the precursor moves upstream at a speed of order 1000 kms@xmath0 , the ion - magnetosonic speed . as shown in figure  [ p1_stage1 ] , the ions move upstream ( negative velocities ) , away from the original shock front , with a speed well above the shock speed .",
    "the ion compression wave is separated from the neutral front by an ion expansion wave , as expected in this shock - tube experiment . * during stage 2 the ion front and the neutral front separate over a time of @xmath73s , at intermediate speeds ( figure  [ p1_stage2 ] ) .",
    "the ion precursor develops fully .",
    "the neutrals possess a weak precursor but are still hardly altered .",
    "* stage 3 represents the approach to a c - type structure , as the neutrals evolve towards a fully continuous flow .",
    "the changes now occur at the alfvn speed of 2kms@xmath0 over a time of @xmath74s . * during stage 4 only small changes to the flow pattern occur .",
    "it takes several alfvn speed crossing times before the steady state solution is finally reached , as described in the previous section ( see fig .  [ p1_stead ] ) .",
    "the final length scale is @xmath75 cm , approximately equal to @xmath76 .",
    "strong magnetic fields cushion a shock by broadening the transition region and reducing the drag heating in the shock front .",
    "this is especially important for c - shocks since the cushioning changes the character of the whole transition by reducing the ion - neutral streaming speed whereas for j - shocks it is usually only felt in the downstream compressed gas .",
    "hence we call these c - shocks ` shock absorbers ' ( smith et al 1991 ) .",
    "this cushioning has observational implications : molecules are not so easily destroyed by ion collisions because the ion - neutral streaming speed is a relatively small fraction of the shock speed . in order to model a shock absorber , we simply reduce the shock speed from the standard case by a factor of 10 to simulate a @xmath77 shock .",
    "we find that all the transition stages are identifiable but last several times longer ( figure  [ p1_absorber ] ) .",
    "indeed it takes @xmath78 years to reach the steady state , comparable to the age of many outflows . note",
    "that the total compression is only about 3 in the example shown .",
    "the final total length of the shock is @xmath79 cm .",
    "it is clear that @xmath76 is indeed an accurate measure of the shock length scale .",
    "oblique shocks develop from the initial state to a steady - state , oblique c - shock without any surprises . by oblique shock , we specifically mean that the magnetic field is inclined to the shock velocity , but not so far inclined that intermediate shock solutions become possible ( smith 1993c ; see below )",
    ". in this regime , the ion and neutral speeds along the flow direction , qv@xmath5 and rv@xmath5 , behave as before , as shown in fig .",
    "[ p1_obl ] .",
    "the ion transverse speed q@xmath80v@xmath5 exceeds the neutral transverse speed r@xmath80v@xmath5 .",
    "note also that the ion transverse speed passes through a maximum , and that the shock is narrower than the transverse solution . thus the grid size was reduced to preserve approximately the same numerical resolution .",
    "when the magnetic field is quasi - parallel , the flow does not reduce to the hydrodynamical equivalent , as is often assumed . even as the transverse field approaches zero , the flow should approach a switch shock solution .",
    "this is due to the strong cooling in molecular shocks , or , here , the assumption of isothermality ( smith 1993a , c ) .",
    "although it is possible that in complex , multi - dimensional , shock configurations a mixture of the three possible shock solutions can be maintained at field angles less than @xmath81 radians , the switch - type solution is the only evolutionary solution in plane - parallel flows ( kennel 1988 ) .    to compute switch shocks we had to solve several problems .",
    "first , we had to set up an appropriate grid .",
    "if we take a magnetic field angle of 2@xmath82 to the flow direction , our standard parameters lead to resolution problems : the neutral shock width is reduced to @xmath83 , but , in contrast , the ion precursor extends far upstream .",
    "we solve this problem simply by extending the grid upstream using a ratioed grid , and increasing the total number of zones .",
    "this problem can still be seen in fig .",
    "[ p1_switch2 ] , where we have reduced @xmath4 to 5 ( @xmath84 = 10kms@xmath0 ) .",
    "the whole ion precursor , as evident in the upstream transverse ion speed , is still not shown .",
    "this precursor will not significantly warm the gas , however , as the heating occurs where the drag is strong and the neutrals decelerate ( see fig .",
    "4 . of smith",
    "( 1993b ) ) .",
    "a second problem is inherent to the ion treatment in this code : steep ion velocity gradients generate numerical instabilities ( mac low & smith 1997b ) .",
    "unfortunately , such steep gradients are exactly what occurs in flows set up along the field lines .",
    "hence , at early times , up to @xmath85s , numerical instability is evident within the ion flow .",
    "the instability is damped as the gradients diminish .",
    "this instability does not occur when , instead of discontinuous initial conditions , we use a hyperbolic tangent function with a width of 110@xmath86 cm , and we get nearly identical results .    the tranverse ion motions are found to have a maximum , as was shown to be true for shocks with @xmath4 @xmath87 , in the steady cold solutions of smith ( 1993a ) .",
    "we have also set up the quasi - hydrodynamic , or intermediate type ii boundary and initial jump conditions .",
    "in intermediate shocks , the post - shock sound speed is subsonic .",
    "as predicted by analytic theory , this flow remained j - type and steady .",
    "it is clear that a c - type flow should not occur since the ions , without the inertia of the magnetic field , are now strongly tied to the neutrals .",
    "such type ii j - shocks in multiple dimensions could degenerate into a fast ( switch type ) and slow shock combination ; exactly what is possible depends on the shock configuration and applied conditions ( see smith 1993c ) .",
    "we find , however , that slow shocks ( e.g. smith 1993c ) are also restricted to the j - shock variety . in this case",
    ", the sub - alfvnic motions tie together the ions and neutrals .",
    "type i intermediate shocks are similar to switch shocks except the small transverse field reverses direction within the shock layer .",
    "we find the evolutionary behaviour follows that of the switch shock , but at a slower pace ( approximately 3 times slower for the standard conditions with the field initially at 1@xmath82 to the shock normal . )",
    "we conclude that a continuous range , from c - type to j - type occurs , when the boundary conditions are altered from switch , via type i and type ii intermediate , to hydrodynamic type .",
    "this is emphasized through fig .",
    "[ inter3 ] , which is an example of an intermediate shock close to the i - ii transition border . here",
    "the jump shock remains while a partial ion / magnetic precursor develops .",
    "note that here also the transverse ion alfn waves propagate far upstream ( the complete computational grid is not shown ) .",
    "a class of physical conditions produce another type of shock structure in which the ions are not conserved . a particularly simple case , in which the ion fraction remains fixed throughout , is considered here .",
    "this can occur when the recombination time is short , such as for molecular ions , with rate coefficients @xmath88@xmath89s@xmath0 rather than atomic ions ; and when the shocks are wide enough for neutralisation reactions to occur ( flower et al 1996 ) .",
    "since the shock width is inversely proportional to the ion density , neutralisation is determined solely by the recombination rate coefficient and alfvn number .",
    "the ratio of shock dynamical to recombination times is @xmath90@xmath89s@xmath91 .",
    "we find that neutralised shocks evolve from the imposed j - type initial state directly to c - type .",
    "the neutral jump section is preceded by a ramp of growing amplitude , as shown in figure  [ p1_neutral ] .",
    "the final c - shock flow pattern is now the ramp structure in the neutrals , preceded by the rapid ion braking . in this zone of rapid ion braking and compression the recombinations",
    "will be hard pressed to suppress a rise in ion density .",
    "this may lead to a narrow peak in the ion density in reality .",
    "the time to reach steady state in a neutralised shock is much longer than for the other shock types .",
    "almost 10@xmath92 years is required for the conditions chosen , comparable with the duration of the class 0 stage of a protostar .",
    "shock widths are correspondingly larger .",
    "furthermore , the age and shock width are inversely proportional to the ion density , as we have checked through further simulations .",
    "hence , low - ionisation shocks may never actually reach a steady state .",
    "shock waves in a magnetized molecular gas will be continuously changing , both through the c - shock instability ( wardle 1990 , neufeld & stone 1997 , mac low & smith 1997a , b ) and through interaction with spatial perturbations in density , ion fraction and magnetic field .",
    "so how can we recognise the evolving shocks described in this paper ? to calculate the emission properties as a function of time , we must first estimate the temperature distribution through the shock . in the continuous sections",
    "this can be done using the ` cool c - shock ' approximation ( smith & brand 1990a ) , provided that the temperature remains low so that the thermodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics are decoupled .",
    "quantitatively , we require that the temperature t @xmath93 m(h@xmath94)@xmath95/k .",
    "the low isothermal temperature adopted ensures this condition in our numerical computations , and strong h@xmath94 cooling often ensures it in real molecular clouds .",
    "the jump sections are dealt with separately : the jump parameters are transferred into the j - shock code of smith ( 1994a ) , the column densities of ions in each excited level are calculated , and then added to the column densities derived from the continuous section in the manner described below .",
    "the temperature profile in the continuous section is determined by the local balance of ion - neutral frictional heating with molecular cooling ( see smith 1993b ) .",
    "simplified cooling functions are adopted consistent with the limitations of the calculations already introduced ( in particular the simplified drag formula ) . here",
    "we restrict the illustrative results to that of h@xmath94 cooling , with the h@xmath94 molecule in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the cooling function is extracted from smith ( 1993b ) : @xmath96 it is straightforward to show that the temperature is then given by t = 2.89n@xmath3v@xmath97 where v@xmath98 is the ion - neutral streaming speed .",

    "we find no significant variations from the above behaviour for the other types of shocks .",
    "switches , oblique shocks and intermediate shocks are of course hotter than the equivalent transverse shocks .",
    "neutralised shocks possess similar excitation signatures as transverse shocks .",
    "we have simulated the evolution of jump shocks into continuous shocks .",
    "we set up boundary and initial conditions appropriate to the c - shock , but separated the two flow regimes by a discontinuous diaphragm as in classical shock tube experiments .",
    "the questions we hope to answer , however , are more general : how do shocks behave in a non - uniform medium ?",
    "do steady - state c - shocks form ? we have indeed found that , in all cases , analytic steady - state solutions are approached , given sufficient time . that time can in the most extreme cases , however , be comparable to the lifetimes of embedded protostars .",
    "four stages were identified for most shock types .",
    "first , an ion expansion wave rapidly advances into the upstream region .",
    "next , the ion - magnetic precursor forms and moves gradually upstream , with a high streaming speed capable of heating the molecules .",
    "the neutrals develop a weak precursor .",
    "then , the neutral jump weakens and disappears .",
    "finally , the c - shock runs through minor adjustments and reaches the steady state .    in intermediate type ii shocks ( which are quasi - hydrodynamic ) , the full jump shock remains with an ion - precursor in advance .",
    "between type i and type ii , partial jumps remain .",
    "switch - on shocks develop extremely long ion - magnetic precursors due to forward - moving undamped ionic alfvn waves .",
    "switch - off shocks , like all slow shocks , are j - shocks .",
    "we have modelled the time - development of molecular hydrogen emission lines in the infrared .",
    "if the initial jump shock is fast , the molecules do not survive , and little emission occurs .",
    "as the precursor develops , the line intensities rise rapidly . as the jump shock decreases in strength ,",
    "the molecules begin to survive and emit with the high excitation characteristic of a jump shock ( e.g.  with a 1 - 0 s(1)/2 - 1 s(1 ) intensity ratio of 35 ) .",
    "later , the jump is too weak to excite h@xmath94 and the c - shock dominates the spectrum , producing line ratios that are very sensitive to the particular parameters of the shock .",
    "the evolution time scale is inversely dependent on the ion density . for typical molecular cloud parameters",
    ", it takes between ( 10@xmath115/n@xmath3)s and ( 210@xmath116/n@xmath3)s to set up the steady - state flow , several times the flow timescale of ( 710@xmath117/n@xmath3)s .",
    "neutralised shocks , modelled here by fixing the ion number density , are approximately m@xmath6 times wider than the transverse equivalent and take the longest to evolve .",
    "it follows that detectable changes to the emission lines occur over periods of at least 60 years for the ion density taken here ( n@xmath3 = 0.1@xmath25 )",
    ". however , faster evolving shocks , due to high ion densities ( perhaps in the densest cloud regions ) , will show detectable changes faster .",
    "the time scale for emission - line variations is @xmath118/n@xmath3)s where n@xmath3 is the pre - shock ion number density .",
    "this study provides the background to investigations of shock interactions , c - type jet flows , and multi - dimensional studies such as simulations of the wardle instability ( mac low & smith 1997a , b ) .",
    "we hope to add additional physics to this version of zeus , including chemical reactions , molecular dissociation and streaming ionisation .",
