    "the realization that one - dimensional , integer spin , antiferromagnets possess an energy gap @xcite has made these systems the object of intense study . the model",
    "perhaps most commonly used to explore their properties is the field theoretic o(3 ) non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) @xcite .",
    "although the model has the virtue of being integrable @xcite , its properties are nonetheless only partially understood .",
    "it is possible to access static , thermodynamic quantities while dynamic properties , in particular , transport properties , are in general , unavailable .",
    "these latter quantities depend upon knowledge of correlation functions which are generically not exactly computable in integrable models .",
    "there are , of course , perturbative techniques by which correlators in the o(3 ) nlsm may be analyzed .",
    "but in strongly coupled models , of which the o(3 ) nlsm is one , perturbative techniques present a host of difficulties and so can miss qualitative ( never mind quantitative ) features in the physics .    the inability to completely understand correlation functions in the fully quantum o(3",
    ") nlsm has been at the root of a recent controversy in the literature .",
    "takigawa et al .",
    "@xcite demonstrated through measurements of the nmr relaxation rate , @xmath3 , of the haldane gap compound , @xmath2 , that at long wavelengths , the spin - spin correlation functions are diffusive in nature . in an elegant series of papers , sachdev and damle @xcite developed a semi - classical treatment to attack the problem and subsequently were able to describe this diffusive behaviour .",
    "nonetheless their computation was semi - classical leaving open the possibility that a fully quantum treatment of the o(3 ) nlsm would lead to different physics .",
    "this possibility was hinted at in the work of fujimoto @xcite . there",
    "the spin conductance was computed using exact thermodynamic considerations . upon subsequent work @xcite",
    ", it became clear that the two treatments produced qualitatively different results . in particular , the drude weight of the spin conductance , @xmath4 , of the o(3 ) nlsm was found to be non - vanishing in the zero field limit @xcite , whereas the corresponding semi - classical treatment sees @xmath5 .",
    "this qualitative difference opens up the possibility that diffusive physics is not present in the o(3 ) nlsm itself but requires some additional mechanism .",
    "such mechanisms might include a spin - phonon coupling ( as suggested by @xcite ) , spin anisotropy , inter - chain coupling ( the spin - chains in @xmath2 are only quasi 1-d - there do exist weak couplings in between chains although the weakness of these couplings seems to preclude this possibility ) , or perhaps small generic integrable - breaking perturbations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we attempt to address this problem by demonstrating a technique to compute exactly a low temperature expansion of correlators in the o(3 ) nlsm .",
    "this expansion is based upon a ` form - factor ' expansion .",
    "form - factor expansions have a long history in the computation of correlators @xcite .",
    "however these expansions have been used almost exclusively at zero temperature .",
    "when they have been used at finite temperature , they have been used either in the computation of expectation values lacking dynamical properties @xcite or in the development of distinct non - perturbative representations ( i.e. fredholm determinants ) of correlators @xcite where all the terms in the expansion were kept . in this article",
    "we show that _ truncated _ form - factor expansions can be used to sensibly describe correlation functions at finite temperature .",
    "this is distinct from the programme proposed in @xcite where form factor expansions were employed but the form factors themselves were recomputed to take direct account of thermal fluctuations .",
    "here we employ the same form factors used in zero temperature computations .",
    "a form - factor expansion of a correlation function is predicated upon some generic properties of integrable models .",
    "most importantly , the exact eigenfunctions of the model s fully interacting hamiltonian are known . with this knowledge comes a well - defined notion of ` particles ' or elementary excitations in the system .",
    "the scattering of these particles is completely described by two - body s - matrices . in particular ,",
    "particle non - conserving processes are disallowed .",
    "ultimately this feature is a consequence of a series of non - trivial conservation laws possessed by the integrable model . in some sense",
    ", an integrable model is a superior version of a fermi liquid : a particle s lifetime is infinite regardless of distance from the fermi surface .    in order to understand these features of the o(3 ) nlsm , we begin by providing an overview of the model .",
    "the o(3 ) nlsm is described by the action , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a bosonic vector field constrained to live on the unit sphere .",
    "this action is arrived at from the hamiltonian of the spin chain , @xmath8 in the continuum , large s , limit , the spin operator , @xmath9 , is related to the field , @xmath10 , via @xmath11 that is , @xmath12 is the sub - lattice or nel order parameter .",
    "@xmath13 on the other hand describes the uniform ( i.e. wavevector @xmath14 ) magnetization .",
    "m is related to @xmath10 via @xmath15 and so is given in terms of the momentum conjugate to * n*.    the low energy excitations in the o(3 ) nlsm take the form of a triplet of bosons .",
    "the bosons have a relativistic dispersion relation given by @xmath16 here @xmath17 is the energy gap or mass of the bosons related to the bare coupling , @xmath18 , via @xmath19 .",
    "the dispersion relation of all three bosons is identical as the model has a global su(2 ) symmetry .",
    "the exact eigenfunctions of the o(3 ) nlsm hamiltonian are then multi - particle states made up of mixtures of the three bosons .",
    "scattering between the bosons is described by the s - matrix @xcite @xmath20 here @xmath21 parameterizes a particle s energy / momentum via @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the primary advantage of this parameterization is the implementation of lorentz boosts .",
    "under such a boost , @xmath24 . as such lorentz invariant quantities are invariably functions of differences of rapidities .",
    "we stress that this relativistic invariance is a natural feature of the low energy structure of the spin chain .",
    "( however we do point out for spin 1 chains , @xmath25 . as @xmath26 serves as the cutoff for the theory ,",
    "the low energy sector of the theory is not unambiguously defined . )    with the excitation spectrum of the o(3 ) nlsm in hand , we return to the form - factor expansion .",
    "a finite temperature expansion of correlators is given in terms of a trace over the boltzmann density matrix : @xmath27 here the state , @xmath28 , denotes a set of n - particles carrying spin quantum numbers @xmath29 .",
    "inserting a resolution of the identity between the two field then leads us to a double sum , .1 in @xmath30 we thus have reduced the evaluation of the correlator to the evaluation of a series of matrix elements ( known as ` form factors ' ) . in an integrable model like the o(3 ) nlsm , these matrix elements are in principle exactly computable .",
    "however as the number of excitations involved increases , the functional forms of the matrix elements become increasingly unwieldy .",
    "this , together with the difficultly in evaluating the sums , @xmath31 , ensure in all but a few special cases the correlators do not admit a closed form expression .    to surmount this",
    "we adapt an idea from zero temperature form - factor expansions . rather than look at the correlator in real space and time",
    ", we examine the ( more relevant ) related spectral function , @xmath32 . in computing @xmath32 , only terms in the form factor sum with a given energy , @xmath33 , and momentum , @xmath34 , contribute to the sum , @xmath35 as enforced by the presence of the two delta functions . for any @xmath36 ,",
    "this dramatically reduces the number of matrix elements one must compute is simply the fourier transform of @xmath37 , but similar considerations also apply to the corresponding retarded correlator . ] .",
    "this reduction nonetheless leaves a difficult computation .",
    "however we can exploit the gapped nature of the spin chain to make the problem more tractable .",
    "because the theory is gapped ( with gap , @xmath17 ) , the correlator admits a low temperature expansion of the form , @xmath38 for the particular correlators of concern in this paper and for the range of @xmath33 and @xmath34 in which we are interested , each @xmath39 is determined by a single matrix element .",
    "because we can compute these matrix elements , we obtain an _ exact _ low temperature expansion .",
    "our ability to compute such an expansion bears upon another controversy in the literature .",
    "leclair and mussardo @xcite argued that it was possible to use the same form - factors we employ here to compute finite temperature correlators .",
    "however rather than directly evaluate individual terms in the sum ( [ eiv ] ) , they first conjectured an ansatz involving a resummation of terms in the sum .",
    "this is described in more detail in section 3 .",
    "this procedure was criticized in @xcite .",
    "there it was argued that while this worked for the computation of one - point functions , it was problematic for two - point functions .",
    "rather it was argued it was better in general to attack such problems through the use of form factors computed against a thermalized vacuum @xcite .",
    "however the counterexample cited in @xcite , a computation involving interacting quantum hall edge states , involved a gapless theory , and so is in a different class than the model considered in this paper .",
    "( without a gap , the low temperature expansion we consider above ceases to make sense . )",
    "this work here shows that it is possible , at least in certain cases , to make sense of the form - factor expansion of two point functions at finite temperature .",
    "but while we can make sense of this expansion , we can not compare our computations directly to the ansatz posited in @xcite .",
    "their ansatz as is applies only to diagonal theories where scattering does not permute internal quantum numbers , contrary to the case here .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the results of the form factor computations for three quantities : the magnetic susceptibility , and two transport properties , the spin conductance and the nmr relaxation rate , @xmath3 .",
    "the details of these computations are found in later sections or in appendices if the reader is so interested .",
    "the first quantity , the susceptibility , is compared to the susceptibility as derived from a low temperature expansion of the exact free energy .",
    "we see that they match verifying our claim that the form factor expansion can yield an exact low temperature expansion .",
    "we compare our transport calculations to the semi - classical computations in @xcite .",
    "the essence of this method lies in treating the spin - chain as a maxwell - boltzmann gas of spins which interact with one another through the low energy limit of the scattering of the o(3 ) nlsm , @xmath40 while static properties computed in the two treatments agree ( for the susceptibility , we find that up to temperatures on the order of the gap , @xmath41 , the two computations agree ) , we see differences in transport properties .",
    "for the spin conductance we find , in contradistinction to the semi - classical computation , that the drude weight of the spin conductance is finite in the limit of zero external field .",
    "our results for the nmr relaxation rate , @xmath3 , indicate a similar discrepancy .",
    "we , like @xcite , find that @xmath3 is characterized by ballistic logarithms .",
    "these logarithms are relatively robust : they continue to appear at higher orders in the low temperature expansion .",
    "we do not , however , see diffusive behaviour in the relaxation rate , i.e. @xmath42 , nor does our low temperature expansion match the low temperature expansion of the semi - classical computation of the correlator .",
    "we consider two possibilities in explaining these discrepancies .",
    "we argue that the structure of the conserved quantities or charges differs between the o(3 ) nlsm and its semi - classical variant and that these differences lead to ballistic behaviour on the one hand and diffusive behaviour on the other .",
    "the other explanation we forward to explain this discrepancy lies in the supra - universality of the low energy s - matrix ( [ eiviii ] ) .",
    "the low energy limit of this s - matrix is shared by generic integer spin chains .",
    "indeed it is shown in @xcite that a two - leg spin-1/2 ladder , expected to share the low energy behaviour of a spin-1 chain , has this exact low - energy s - matrix .",
    "however rather than the supra - universality being a virtue , it may be that it under - specifies the physics . in this way the semi - classical treatment , valid in and of itself ( particularly in light of its ability to reproduce experimental data ) , may capture different physics than that of the o(3 ) nlsm .",
    "in section 2 we consider this further in the light of the sine - gordon model where a similar phenomena may be argued to occur .",
    "in the first part of section 3 we explain in some detail how the form - factor expansion is to be understood .",
    "in particular we consider the various technical details of the expansion , including how to regulate the infinities that appear generically in the form factors of the double expansion . in second part of section 3",
    "we review the specific form factors of the o(3 ) nlsm . and finally in section 4 , we review the low temperature expansion of the exact free energy , necessary for comparison with the form - factor computation of the susceptibility .",
    ".5 in      in this subsection we present results for the magnetic susceptibility arising from several methods of computation : a form factor evaluation of the magnetization - magnetization correlator in the context of a kubo formula , an exact computation of the system s free energy , and finally , treating the excitations of the @xmath0 sigma model as non - interacting particles obeying both a fermi - dirac distribution and a maxwell - boltzmann distribution in the spirit of the semi - classical approximation of sachdev and damle @xcite .",
    "we thus will be able to determine the temperature regime over which our truncation of the form factor expansion applies as well as comparing with other computational techniques .",
    "the susceptibility , @xmath43 , at @xmath44 can be computed from the magnetization - magnetization operator using a kubo formula : @xmath45_{{{\\omega}}_n \\rightarrow -i{{\\omega}}+\\delta } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to evaluate this correlator we employ an expansion in terms of the exact eigenfunctions of the theory , i.e. a form factor expansion . in particular we write @xmath46 here @xmath47 is a state of n excitations with spins described by @xmath48 . in writing the above we have suppressed sums over the energy and momenta of the excitations . a term in the thermal trace with n",
    "excitations is weighted by a factor of @xmath49 . at low temperatures",
    "it is thus a good approximation to truncate this trace . for this computation",
    "we keep only terms with one and two excitations , i.e. @xmath50 .",
    "to evaluate the matrix elements appearing in ( [ eiiii ] ) we insert a resolution of the identity in between the two fields . as we only consider matrix elements involving one and two excitations from the thermal trace ,",
    "we thus have @xmath51 in the above we have truncated the sum arising from the resolution of the identity . with the first matrix element of the thermal trace , we only keep terms from the resolution of identity with one excitation .",
    "we are interested in the behaviour of the susceptibility at @xmath52 and this term provides the only contribution .",
    "similarly , the only term arising from the second matrix element of the thermal trace contributing to the dc susceptibility comes from keeping the term from the resolution of the identity involving two excitations .",
    "further details surrounding the methodology of this expansion and the explicit exact evaluation of the matrix elements are found in section 3 and appendix a. with such details we can evaluate @xmath53 with the result @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are standard modified bessel functions .",
    "the first term in @xmath56 is a ` disconnected ' contribution related to @xmath55 .",
    "the second term is a connected contribution and as such is genuinely distinct from @xmath55 .",
    "we now consider such disconnected contributions further .      in computing the susceptibility , we are able to go beyond the approximation introduced in truncating the form factor sum arising from the thermal trace .",
    "it is possible to include ` disconnected ' terms arising from higher particle contributions .",
    "such disconnected terms appear when higher particle matrix elements are evaluated .",
    "for example when we evaluate the four excitation matrix element @xmath60 , we obtain a term of the form @xmath61 this term is ` disconnected ' in that it is directly related to a matrix element involving a lesser number ( two ) of excitations .",
    "it arises from the annihilation of @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "such a term is responsible , as we just indicated , for the first term of @xmath56 above .",
    "what is remarkable is that we are able to sum up over _ all _ possible disconnected pieces arising from arbitrarily high particle form factors which are proportional to the connected lower particle matrix elements already computed .",
    "this resummation amounts to the evaluation of a geometric series .",
    "for example , including all disconnected terms involving the matrix element going into the evaluation of @xmath55 modifies it as follows @xmath64 we see resumming the disconnected pieces thus reproduces both @xmath55 and the first term in @xmath56 plus additional terms higher order in @xmath65 .",
    "the appearance of the factors @xmath66 in the geometric series is natural and arises from the boltzmann weighting of the higher particle terms .",
    "the combinatorial factor of 3 reflects the three bosons in the system .    in collecting all the disconnected pieces related to the _ connected _ term in @xmath56",
    ", we find something similar @xmath67 one expects in general that the inclusion of disconnected terms from arbitrarily high particle number will improve the accuracy of the calculation . in the case of the susceptibility ,",
    "the agreement between the form factor computation and the exact numerical analysis actually becomes slightly worse .",
    "however this should not be taken as indicative of the resummation in general .",
    "we will comment on this further at the end of this section .",
    "for the purposes of comparison , we compute the susceptibility of both a free electron gas ( or equivalently , a system of hard - core bosons ) as well as a maxwell - boltzmann gas . at sufficiently low temperatures both of these quantities should be close to the exact value of @xmath43 for the @xmath0 sigma model .",
    "how the susceptibility of the free electron gas deviates from the exact value of @xmath43 gives us an understanding of the temperature at which interactions become important .",
    "and how the susceptibility of the maxwellian gas deviates from the exact answer marks the temperature at which the semi - classical approximation found in damle and sachdev @xcite must begin to breakdown .",
    "these two susceptibilities are given by @xmath68 we see that at low temperatures ( @xmath69 ) both of these expressions coincide with the low temperature limit of the form factor computation of @xmath43 . in particular , the terms of @xmath70 are identical .",
    "it is possible in the case of the @xmath0 sigma model to arrive at exact expressions ( in the form of coupled integral equations ) for the zero - field susceptibility @xcite .",
    "these equations , in their most compact form , appear as @xmath71 we will show results from the exact numerical evaluation of these equations in the next section . however these equations admit a closed form low temperature expansion .",
    "the details of this expansion may be found in section 4 .",
    "here we just give the final results @xmath72 remarkably , we see this expansion agrees exactly with the corresponding expression derived with the aid of form factors .",
    "thus the form factor expansion at finite temperature meets an important test .      in this section",
    "we compare the various methods of computing the susceptibility of the @xmath0 sigma model . in figure 1",
    "are plotted the susceptibilities computed via an exact numerical analysis of the tba equations , a low temperature expansion of the same equations , and a computation based upon the two and four particle form factors .",
    "we see that as indicated previously that the form factor computation and the low temperature expansion match exactly .",
    "moreover these two computations track the exact susceptibility over a considerable range of temperatures despite the fact these computations are truncated low temperature expansions .    in figure 2",
    "we compare both the exact tba susceptibility and the form factor computation of @xmath43 with the susceptibility of a classical maxwellian gas .",
    "we see the results track one another for temperatures , @xmath73 . for temperatures beyond @xmath17",
    ", however , the maxwellian susceptibility differs markedly .",
    "this is then roughly the temperature at which the semi - classical approximation found in @xcite should be expected to break down .    in figure 3",
    "are plotted the exact results for the susceptibility together with the susceptibility from the resummed form factors .",
    "we see that the resummed susceptibility is somewhat higher that the exact numerics at @xmath74 and disagrees at roughly the @xmath75 level whereas the susceptibility computed using the unresummed form factors sees better agreement at these same temperatures . at lower temperatures ( @xmath76 )",
    "the disagreement between the exact numerics and the two form factor computations is roughly the same . in general",
    "then , the resummation does not improve the accuracy of the computation of the susceptibility .",
    ".5 in      in this section we compute the spin conductivity , @xmath77 .",
    "the spin conductivity gives the response of the spin chain to a spatially varying magnetic field .",
    "it is defined via @xmath78 and so can be expressed in terms of a kubo formula , @xmath79 in the notation used in this paper the spin current @xmath80 is synonymous with @xmath81 , the lorentz current counterpart of the uniform magnetization , @xmath82 .",
    "we will focus primarily on computing the drude weight , d , of @xmath83 , i.e. computing the term in @xmath84 of the form @xmath85 however we are able to compute @xmath77 for general @xmath86 .",
    "we find that for @xmath87 , @xmath88 , the spin conductivity is described solely by the drude weight .",
    "in particular , we find no indication of a regular contribution to @xmath89 .",
    "to evaluate @xmath77 , we employ the identical form factor expansion to that used in computing the susceptibility . and",
    "like the susceptibility , our result is an exact low temperature expansion of @xmath4 , @xmath90 here we will compute @xmath91 and @xmath92 exactly .",
    "as the details of the computation are nearly identical to that of the susceptibility , we merely write down the results : @xmath93",
    "this expression involves only the two and four particle form factors .",
    "if we also include all higher order disconnected terms related to those above we find instead ( akin to the susceptibility ) , @xmath94 we plot these two results in figure 4 as a function of @xmath95 .",
    "akin to the susceptibility , the result does not differ greatly if the resummed disconnected terms are included .",
    "we observe that @xmath96 .",
    "this is in accordance with @xcite where @xmath4 is computed using an argument involving the finite size scaling of the thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations .",
    "( we do note that the computation of @xmath4 at @xmath44 in @xcite appears only as a note added in proof and so is decidedly sketchy .",
    "however the equations governing @xmath4 developed in @xcite are manifestly positive with the consequence @xmath4 can not vanish . ) but our results do differ from the semi - classical computation of @xcite where is was found that @xmath4 vanishes at @xmath44 . and",
    "again we find no additional regular contributions to @xmath97  only the drude term is present .",
    "this is true not just to the order of the form factor expansion we work but at least to one higher order .",
    "moreover we are willing to conjecture that is true to all orders .",
    "we have only given the spin conductivity at @xmath44 .",
    "however it is extremely straightforward to generalize the form factor computation to finite h. as h couples to the total spin , a conserved quantity , the form factors , @xmath98 , of an operator , @xmath99 , carrying spin s , are altered via the rule @xmath100 ( in the case of the spin conductance , the spin currents , @xmath101 , carry no spin and so are not altered at all . )",
    "the only remaining change induced by a finite field is to the boltzmann factor appearing in the thermal trace .",
    "if an excitation with rapidity , @xmath21 , carries spin s , its boltzmann factor becomes @xmath102 for example we find @xmath4 as a function of @xmath103 ( to @xmath70 ) to be @xmath104 again this in agreement with @xcite",
    ". indeed @xcite computes @xmath105 at large @xmath106 ( but @xmath107 ) to be @xmath108 up to a factor of @xmath109 , this expression is in exact agreement with [ eiixvi ] . in this particular case",
    "our derivation of @xmath105 agrees with the semi - classical computation @xcite ( provided @xmath110 ) .",
    "the symmetries in the semi - classical model that lead @xmath111 to vanish are broken for finite h.    .5 in      in this section we compute the nmr relaxation rate , @xmath3 .",
    "we are interested in computing this rate in order to compare it to the experimental data found in @xcite on the relaxation rate of the quasi one - dimensional spin chain , @xmath2 . for temperatures in excess of @xmath112 ( the gap , @xmath17 , in this compound is on the order of @xmath113 ) ,",
    "the experimental data @xcite shows the relaxation rate to have an inverse dependence upon @xmath114 : @xmath115 this dependence is nicely reproduced by the semi - classical methodology in @xcite .",
    "moreover the semi - classical computation reproduces the activated behaviour of @xmath3 in this same temperature regime : @xmath116 we are interested in determining whether a calculation in the fully quantum o(3 ) nlsm can reproduce these results . to this end",
    "we compute @xmath3 using a form factor expansion .",
    "sagi and affleck @xcite have already done such a computation to lowest order in @xmath65 .",
    "but they do not find the above behaviour .",
    "rather they see @xmath117 we continue this computation one further step , computing to @xmath118 .",
    "given the behaviour , @xmath119 , appears only as t is increased beyond 100k ( i.e. @xmath120 ) , it is not unreasonable to suppose higher order terms in a low temperature expansion of @xmath3 are needed to see this singularity .    to proceed with the computation of @xmath3 , we review its constituent elements .",
    "@xmath3 can be expressed in terms of the spin - spin correlation function @xcite : @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the nuclear lamour frequency with @xmath123 the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio and the @xmath124 are the hyperfine coupling constants . in the above we assume h is aligned in the 3-direction .",
    "the above integral is dominated by values of @xmath34 near 0 @xcite .",
    "moreover in the relevant experiment , the hyperfine couplings are such that only @xmath125 contributes .",
    "hence @xmath126 we now proceed to compute @xmath125 .    to compute @xmath125 , we again employ a form factor expansion .",
    "akin to the computation of the susceptibility and the spin conductance , this computation amounts to a low temperature expansion of @xmath125 , @xmath127 where we are able to compute @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "we place the details of this computations in appendix b , here merely quoting results : @xmath130 where @xmath131 is euler s constant .",
    "we are interested in the regime @xmath132 ( the regime where it is expected spin diffusion produces singular behaviour in @xmath3 ) .",
    "the terms that we have dropped do not affect this behaviour . in principle",
    "there is no difficulty in writing down the exact expression ( to @xmath118 ) ; it is merely unwieldy .",
    "this expression for @xmath3 is plotted in figure 5 for a variety of values of the ratio @xmath95 .",
    "we see that we do not obtain the same behaviour as found in @xcite .",
    "going to the next order in @xmath118 produces a behaviour in @xmath3 as @xmath133 identical to the lower order computation of @xmath134 : we again find a logarithmic behaviour consistent with ballistic transport .",
    "an alternative comparison we might make to the results of @xcite is to perform a low temperature expansion ( in @xmath134 ) of the semi - classical computation of @xmath135 .",
    "doing so by treating @xmath136 as a small parameter , we find @xmath137 we see that the low temperature expansion of the semi - classical result agrees to leading order with our computation but afterward differs .",
    "( we have already seen that this occurs with the computation of the susceptibility . )",
    "it possesses no term of @xmath118 .",
    "the next term rather appears at @xmath138 and possesses a @xmath139 divergence . that the small @xmath103 behaviour should be @xmath140 does suggest the importance of summing up terms .",
    "but the lack of a term of @xmath118 in the semi - classical result nonetheless hints that the two results are genuinely different .",
    "we have demonstrated that it is possible to compute exact low temperature expansions of correlators using form factors .",
    "moreover we have done so in a non - trivial theory where particle scattering sees the exchange of quantum numbers . an important question to answer concerns the breadth of the applicability of our techniques . our ability to carry out these computations",
    "was partially predicated upon the particular correlators we studied .",
    "for example , the fact that only a single matrix element contributes at @xmath70 and @xmath118 in the computation of the susceptibility is related to the magnetization operator in the o(3 ) nlsm model being a lorentz current density .",
    "because of these particular details , we thus expect that exact low temperature expansions of correlators will not be available in all theories .",
    "the computation of correlators is done in the context of a grand canonical partition function .",
    "specifically , we do not work at fixed particle number but include matrix elements involving an arbitrary number of particles or excitations ( see [ eiv ] for example ) .",
    "this differs from the treatment found in @xcite .",
    "there correlators are computed in a canonical ensemble using form factors at some fixed particle number , @xmath141 . a thermodynamic limit is then taken , @xmath142 holding @xmath143 ( i.e. the particle density ) fixed . on a technical level these methods may seem ostensibly different .",
    "in particular in this paper we end up computing correlators using form factors involving a small finite number of particles whereas @xcite computes correlators using form factors involving a diverging number of particles .",
    "it might appear then that we are somehow missing information that arises in working at a finite particle density .",
    "this would seem crucial in computing transport properties where a finite particle density is necessarily determinant .",
    "however this difference is only apparent .",
    "the n particle form factors used by @xcite include disconnected terms .",
    "these disconnected terms are equivalent to form factors involving small numbers of particles .",
    "the ( large ) n - particle form factors then contain the same information we use in our representation of the correlators .",
    "moreover we can make this identification precise .",
    "our use of form factors in the grand canonical ensemble involving some few number of particles , @xmath144 , is predicated upon the small parameter , @xmath145 .",
    "but the disconnected terms of an n - particle form factor involving @xmath144 particles ( with @xmath146 ) are similarly weighted by the same small parameter , @xmath147 .",
    "more generally , the presence of a gap , @xmath17 , thus means we can in principle create an explicit map between the two approaches .",
    "the semi - classical method found in @xcite is similar to the approach taken in @xcite in that it uses a canonical ensemble .",
    "it is an interesting question whether a grand canonical ensemble approach can be developed in this same semi - classical approach .",
    "the answer is not obvious .",
    "our method works ( at least at the technical level ) because we can readily identify disconnected terms .",
    "it is not clear whether a similar identification can be made semi - classically .",
    "we do want to emphasize a caveat to our methodology as discussed in some detail in section 3 .",
    "it is unclear whether it is possible to compute quantities that show non - analyticities as @xmath148 .",
    "for example it is not obvious how to compute the thermal broadening present in the single particle spectral function . at @xmath149",
    "it takes the form @xmath150 but is expected to broaden into a gaussian - like peak at finite t. to see this in a form factor expansion would likely require a resummation of terms",
    ". however it may well be feasible to deduce the necessary resummation from the lower order terms in the form factor expansion .",
    "we have also discussed using a resummation of higher order ` disconnected ' terms to improve the form - factor computation . for the quantities",
    "considered , it turned out the resummation did not provide a real improvement to the original computation",
    ". nevertheless we would guess that in general , the resummed form factors will provide a more reliable answer as the temperature is increased .",
    "it is an artefact of the above cases that they do not do so here .",
    "for example , we see that at extremely high temperatures , the susceptibility as computed by either of the form - factors methods saturates to a constant . as such , errors in either method are cutoff  as these expressions at @xmath151",
    "do not differ greatly from their low @xmath152 values , any potential error is bounded .",
    "if instead we computed the finite field magnetization where we would expect a linear @xmath152 dependence , the differences between the two form - factor computations would be comparatively magnified .    to come to some sort of judgement between the form - factor and the semi - classical approaches , an understanding is needed of the differences between our computations of the spin conductance and the nmr relaxation rate . in the case of the first quantity ,",
    "it is likely this difference is real and not an artefact of our methodology .",
    "the data that goes into the spin conductance is identical to that needed to compute the susceptibility and we know that we can match the low temperature expansion of the susceptibility with a similar expansion coming from the exact free energy",
    ". moreover we know that the drude weight of @xmath153 has been found to be finite from an approach @xcite independent of ours .    in generic systems the drude weight , @xmath4 , of a conductivity at finite temperatures will be zero .",
    "it is then the integrability of the o(3 ) nlsm and the attendant existence of an infinite number of conserved quantities that leads to a finite weight .",
    "the existence of these quantities can be directly related to a finite @xmath4 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , @xmath4 is bounded from below via an inequality developed by mazur : @xmath154 where @xmath26 is the relevant current operator , @xmath155 are a set of orthogonal conserved quantities , i.e. @xmath156 , and @xmath157 is some constant . for a finite drude weight",
    "we then require that at least one matrix element , @xmath158 , does not vanish . while we do no direct computations ,",
    "we can obtain an indication of whether the matrix elements vanish by examining the symmetries of the model . under the discrete ( @xmath159 ) symmetries of the o(3 ) nlsm , the spin current , @xmath26 , transforms via @xmath160 in order that the matrix element , @xmath161 , not vanish we require that @xmath162 the @xmath159 symmetries in the o(3 ) nlsm include @xmath163 , @xmath164 , parity , and time reversal .",
    "the spin current we are interested in transforms under rotations as a vector . thus any charge , @xmath155 , coupling to the current must also transform as such . from the work by lscher @xcite ,",
    "it is clear there is at least one conserved vectorial quantity such that @xmath161 does not vanish due to the action of one of the above @xmath159 symmetries .",
    "while the structure of the conserved quantities in the o(3 ) nlsm seem to be consistent with the existence of a finite drude weight , this is not the case in the semi - classical approach .",
    "the dynamics of the semi - classical approximation used in @xcite also admit an infinite number of conserved quantities ( but importantly , different than those appearing in the fully quantum model ) .",
    "however as shown there , the structure of the @xmath159 symmetries in the semi - classical approach is such that all matrix elements , @xmath158 , vanish .",
    "it would thus seem the absence of a drude weight in the semi - classical case is a consequence of differences in the symmetries between the semi - classical and fully quantum models .    to understand the discrepancies in the case of the nmr relaxation rate , @xmath1 , is not as simple .",
    "however if we believe that the spin conductance demonstrates finite temperature ballistic behaviour , it is hardly surprising to find the nmr relaxation rate characterized by ballistic logarithms .",
    "again the difference between the fully quantum treatment and the semi - classical approach will lie in the differences between the models conserved quantities .",
    "nonetheless one possibility that we must consider is that merely going to @xmath118 in the computation of @xmath1 is insufficient .",
    "it is possible that we need to perform some resummation of contributions from all orders to see the desired singular behaviour , @xmath42 .",
    "while this would belie our experience with computing the susceptibility and the spin conductance via the correlators , the data that goes into the two computations is not exactly identical .",
    "thus the possibility that the low temperature expansion of @xmath3 is not well controlled can not be entirely ruled out .",
    "the differences in the nature of the conserved quantities between the o(3 ) nlsm and the semi - classical model of @xcite suggest the latter is not equivalent to the o(3 ) nlsm , even at low energies .",
    "an indication of this lack of equivalency may lie in the universal nature of the ultra low energy s - matrix .",
    "this quantity is the primary input of the semi - classical model .",
    "the semi - classical model imagines a set of classical spins interacting via @xmath165 i.e. in the scattering of two spins , the spins exchange their quantum numbers .",
    "however this specification may be insufficient to adequately describe the o(3 ) nlsm . even beyond the quantum interference effects which are neglected by the semi - classical treatment ,",
    "it is not clear that the zero - momentum s - matrix is enough to determine the model .    in this light",
    "it is instructive to consider the sine - gordon model in its repulsive regime .",
    "the sine - gordon model is given by the action , @xmath166 where @xmath167 .",
    "the model is generically gapped .",
    "its repulsive regime occurs in the range , @xmath168 .",
    "the model s spectrum then consists solely of a doublet of solitons carrying u(1 ) charge .",
    "it is repulsive in the sense that the solitons have no bound states .",
    "the sine - gordon model has a similar low energy s - matrix to the o(3 ) nlsm , @xmath165 where here the particle indices range over @xmath169 , the two solitons in the theory .",
    "thus we might expect that sine - gordon model to possess identical low energy behaviour over its entire repulsive regime .",
    "this is likely to be in general untrue .",
    "for example we might consider the behaviour of the single particle spectral function .",
    "we might thus want to compute a correlator of the form @xmath170 where @xmath171 are mandelstam fermions given by @xmath172 as these fields depend explicitly upon @xmath173 , it is hard to see how the properties of the above correlator , even at low energies could be independent of this same quantity .",
    "more generally , @xmath173 determines the compactification radius of the boson in the model and so is related in a fundamental way to the model s properties .",
    "it is useful to point out that mandelstam fermions are the unique fields that create / destroy solitons that carry lorentz spin 1/2 , i.e. a spin that is independent of @xmath173",
    ". they would then be the only fields with a chance of matching any semi - classical computation .",
    "however there are other soliton creation fields , for example , @xmath174 for which one could determine the corresponding spectral density .",
    "as these fields carry spin that varies as a function of @xmath173 , their spectral functions will depend upon more than the ultra low energy soliton s - matrix .",
    "in general , the semi - classical treatment of the sine - gordon model can not capture its full quantum field content .    as with the o(3 )",
    "nlsm , the conductance of the fully quantum model differs from that of the semi - classical treatment .",
    "if one were to compute the conductance at finite temperature in the sine - gordon model one would again find a finite drude weight , @xmath4 , while the semi - classical approach yields @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "the notion of under - specificity appears here again .",
    "the semi - classical approach for the sine - gordon model equally well describes the hubbard model at half - filling ( the solitons are replaced by particle / hole excitations in the half - filled band ) .",
    "but it fails to give the correct drude weight .",
    "an analysis of finite size corrections to the free energy in the presence of an aharonov - bohm flux @xcite again finds a finite drude weight in the half - filled hubbard model at finite temperature .",
    "interestingly however , there are certain properties at low energies that seem to be independent of @xmath173 . for example , if one were to compute the low temperature static charge susceptibility , the term of @xmath70 would be independent of @xmath173 .",
    "however at the next order , @xmath118 , this would almost certainly cease to be true .",
    "and the energy / temperature ranges we are interested in exploring do not permit dropping terms of @xmath118 .",
    "it is important to stress we do not question the agreement between the semi - classical model and experiment . what we do question is whether the fully quantum o(3 ) nlsm exhibits spin diffusivity .",
    "if we are then to understand spin diffusion in terms of the o(3 ) nlsm , it is possible we need to include additional physics such as an easy axis spin anisotropy ( weakly present in the experimental system , @xmath2 ) , inter - chain couplings , or a spin - phonon coupling ( as done in @xcite ) .    beyond these , another mechanism that might lead to diffusive behaviour are small integrable breaking perturbations of the o(3 ) nlsm .",
    "generically any physical realization of a spin chain will possess such perturbations , even if arbitrarily small .",
    "such perturbations may introduce the necessary ergodicity into the system , ergodicity that is absent in the integrable model because of the presence of non - trivial conserved charges , and so lead to diffusive behaviour . as discussed in the semi - classical context by garst and rosch @xcite , such perturbations introduce an additional time scale , @xmath152 , governing the decay of conserved quantities in the problem . for times ,",
    "@xmath176 , the behaviour of the system is ballistic and the original conserved quantities do not decay . for times ,",
    "@xmath177 , the behaviour is then diffusive .",
    "consequently the drude weight in the purely integrable model is transformed into a peak in @xmath178 at @xmath179 .",
    "now the difference in the physics between the o(3 ) nlsm and its semi - classical variant is not that of integrable breaking perturbations .",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , their semi - classical model is classically integrable .",
    "however as discussed above the models do possess different conserved charges .",
    "it might then seem for certain transport quantities , the semi - classical model cures the lack of ergodicity present in its quantum counterpart .",
    "here we present the general method by which we compute the correlators at low but finite temperature and field : form factor expansions . in the first part of this section we consider the general form of these expansions and why we expect them to be applicable at finite temperature . in the latter parts of this section , we review the exact expressions for the form factors in the o(3 ) sigma model together with the necessary regulation of said form factors at finite temperature .      to compute two - point correlation functions",
    ", we employ a form factor expansion . at finite temperature , such correlators",
    "take the form @xmath180 here t can be real or imaginary time and the sum @xmath181 is over all possible eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "each eigenstate is characterized by the number of particles , @xmath144 , in the state together with a set of internal quantum numbers , @xmath29 , in this case the value of @xmath182 carried by each particle .",
    "the form factor representation of the correlator is then arrived at by inserting a resolution of the identity between the two fields : @xmath183 at zero temperature , the representation of @xmath184 reduces to one involving a single sum , @xmath185 .",
    "thus the computation of @xmath184 amounts to the evaluation of a set of matrix elements .",
    "these matrix elements can be computed in principle for arbitrary @xmath186 from a knowledge of the two - body s - matrix together with various constraints coming from the analytic dependence of the matrix elements upon energy - momentum .",
    "however with increasing @xmath144 and @xmath187 the evaluation of these matrix elements and the corresponding evaluation of the sums , @xmath188 , becomes increasingly arduous .",
    "we are however in a better position when we consider the spectral function corresponding to @xmath184 : @xmath189 we see then that only certain terms , those meeting the matching condition , @xmath190 , contribute to the spectral function .    in this paper we are concerned in particular with massive or gapped theories .",
    "gapped theories are particularly amenable to this sort of computation as they admit a notion of thresholds .",
    "first imagine fixing @xmath191 in the sum above . in a massive theory",
    "the intermediate states have a finite energy .",
    "in particular in the o(3 ) sigma model , the energy of an m - particle state has a minimum threshold of @xmath192 .",
    "and so states with @xmath193 exceeding @xmath194 do not contribute to the sum .",
    "for example if @xmath194 is below the three particle threshold , @xmath195 , states with @xmath196 do not make a contribution .    at zero temperature ,",
    "i.e. @xmath197 , the notion of thresholds leads to a situation where only a finite number of matrix elements needs to be computed in order to obtain an _ exact _ result at a given energy , @xmath198 .",
    "in contrast , at finite temperature we in general would need to compute an infinite number of matrix elements in order to arrive at an exact result .",
    "however here the massiveness of the theory again comes to our aid . with increasing @xmath144 ,",
    "the terms are weighted with the boltzmann factor , @xmath199 .",
    "thus at temperatures small relative to the gap , @xmath17 , we expect in general only the first terms to make a significant contribution .",
    "we can thus evaluate the correlator in a controlled fashion , expanding it as the sum , @xmath200 moreover while the evaluation of this sum in its entirety would require the evaluation of an infinite number of matrix elements , each individual coefficient , @xmath201 , depends only upon a finite number of matrix elements ( at least in the cases considered in this paper ) . as such we are able to compute these coefficients exactly .",
    "while the ability to do so results from each @xmath201 being determined by a small , finite number of matrix elements , this feature will not be found in all theories .",
    "however form factor expansions in massive theories have in general found to be strongly convergent @xcite .",
    "specifically , matrix elements , @xmath202 , where @xmath144 and @xmath187 are large have been found to be relatively small . even in massless theories where there are no explicit thresholds",
    ", convergence is good provided the engineering dimension of the operator @xmath203 matches its anomalous dimension .",
    "thus even if each @xmath201 were determined by a large ( even infinite ) number of matrix elements it would be possible nonetheless to arrive at a reasonable approximation for the coefficient .",
    "there are , however , certain situations where we do not expect to be able to truncate the sum , @xmath204 . in certain circumstances ,",
    "a physical quantity will see a transition as the limit of zero temperature is taken that is non - analytic in nature . to be concrete consider the single particle spectral function of the staggered component of the spin field : @xmath205 at zero temperature , we expect that for energies , @xmath206 , @xmath207 takes the form of a @xmath208-function : @xmath209 however at finite temperatures this @xmath208-function is broadened .",
    "we then do not expect to be able to see this broadening unless we evaluate the sum , @xmath210 , in its entirety .",
    "indeed , computing @xmath207 through the truncation of this sum at any finite @xmath144 leads to @xmath211 only through the resummation of the higher order terms is the @xmath208-function replaced by a broadened peak .",
    "however it may well be possible to guess at the resummation on the basis of the first terms in the series .    rather than consider such situations , we want to focus upon quantities that possess a smooth @xmath148 transition .",
    "as such consider the behaviour of the staggered field spectral function , @xmath212 , for energies below the gap @xmath213 . at @xmath149",
    "we have @xmath214 while at @xmath215 @xmath216 thus the @xmath217 limit behaves in a smooth fashion .",
    "this method is markedly different than that developed in @xcite . in our method",
    "we employ the basis of eigenstates , @xmath218 , that arises from the zero temperature problem .",
    "there a new basis is adopted that takes into direct account the thermalization of the vacuum state .",
    "let @xmath219 be the state with a representation of the particle content of the system in equilibrium at finite @xmath152 and let @xmath220 be states that are excitations above this thermalized ground state .",
    "( in contrast , @xmath218 are excitations above the empty vacuum state . ) with such a basis , the correlators have the following form factor representation : @xmath221 this method involves considerable technical complications . in general",
    ", it is a challenge to compute the new vacuum state @xmath222 as well as the excitations above @xmath222 , never mind the form factors @xmath223 .",
    "these difficulties are only enhanced by the non - diagonal scattering present in the o(3 ) sigma model , i.e. the two - body s - matrix is other than @xmath224 , where no internal quantum number are exchanged .",
    "this method was developed in particular for theories that are massless .",
    "however in our case the theory is gapped .",
    "it thus makes sense to exploit the control over the sum , @xmath210 , that the low temperature regime affords us .    in some sense",
    "our approach is similar to that of leclair and mussardo @xcite .",
    "there they begin with the form factor sum as in ( [ eiiii ] ) .",
    "however they recast the sum of the thermal trace through introducing a set of hole excitations complementary to the particles .",
    "hole excitations appear naturally in terms of the form factors . a typical form factor that needs to be evaluated for a finite t correlator looks as follows , @xmath225 where we have explicitly labelled the energy of the state . using crossing symmetry",
    ", this matrix element can be rewritten as @xmath226 provided @xmath227 , @xmath228 does not hold . here",
    "@xmath229 is the ` charge conjugate ' of @xmath63 .",
    "the excitation , @xmath230 , can be thought of as a new type of excitation , a hole .",
    "thus the double sum of a two point correlator was recast in @xcite as @xmath231 notice that the partition function , @xmath232 , is absent from ( [ eiiixii ] ) while new factors , @xmath233 , have been added to the expression .",
    "each @xmath234 is the occupation number of the excitation ( in this case assumed to be fermionic ) , @xmath235 , with energy @xmath236 : @xmath237 these modifications represent an ansatz put forward in @xcite , and are argued to come from the regulation of the matrix elements , @xmath238 in the case @xmath239 , @xmath227 .",
    "although this ansatz is supported in the case of one point functions ( i.e. expectation values of the energy or spin ) @xcite , it has come under criticism for the computation of two - point functions in @xcite . there",
    "the allied case of current - current correlators in the quantum hall edge problem at @xmath149 but finite voltage was examined and it was found that their ansatz did not seem to reproduce the correct results .",
    "what relevance does this critique have for our approach ? we do not and can not use the ansatz of leclair and mussardo as scattering in our theory is non - diagonal and their ansatz only makes sense in the case of theories that are diagonal",
    ". however might the critique in @xcite still have bearing upon our results ?",
    "we do not think so .",
    "the correlator considered in @xcite is computed in a massless theory whereas our results depend upon the gapped nature of the o(3 ) sigma model producing a series of thresholds .",
    "moreover we already expect to run into difficulties whenever there is non - analytic behaviour at @xmath149 near a threshold as in the behaviour of the staggered field spectral function near @xmath240 .",
    "thus we do not expect to capture the physics of the conflation of all the thresholds in a massless theory .",
    "the form factors of a field @xmath241 are defined as the matrix elements of the field with some number of particles , @xmath242 : @xmath243 the @xmath242 are faddeev - zamolodchikov operators which create and destroy the elementary excitations of the theory .",

    ". however the form factors encountered in the evaluation of finite temperature correlators are of the form @xmath291 to understand such an object we must contend with the possibility that @xmath292 , @xmath293 for some @xmath294 . from the algebra of the fadeev - zamolodchikov operators ( [ eiiixvi ] ) ,",
    "we know the commutation relations involve @xmath208-functions , i.e. @xmath295 it is crucial to include the contributions of the @xmath208-functions to the correlators . in particular",
    "they contribute pieces which cancel off otherwise ill - defined terms arising from the partition function .",
    "to do so we must understand the above form factor to equal @xmath296 the sum in the above is over all possible subsets of @xmath297 and @xmath298 .",
    "the s - matrix @xmath299 arises from the commutations necessary to rewrite @xmath300 as @xmath301 and similarly for @xmath302 .",
    "the matrix element @xmath303 is evaluated using the fadeev - zamolodchikov algebra . in this way (",
    "ill - defined ) terms proportional to @xmath304 are produced but which cancel similarly ill - defined terms arising from the evaluation of the partition function .",
    "the ` connected ' form factor appearing in the above expression is to be understood as follows . using crossing symmetry ,",
    "the form factor can be rewritten as @xmath305 where the last relation holds provided we do not have @xmath306 , @xmath307 for any @xmath294 .",
    "if this does occur we see from the annihilation pole axiom that the form factor is not well defined , having a pole at @xmath306 . in such cases",
    "the form factor requires regulation .    to regulate the form factor",
    ", we employ a scheme suggested by balog @xcite and used by leclair and mussardo@xcite .",
    "we define @xmath308 in taking the finite piece of @xmath309 , we discard terms proportional to @xmath310 as well as terms proportional to @xmath311 . in this way",
    "the connected piece is independent of the way the various limits @xmath312 are taken .",
    "balog @xcite has already used this prescription to compute one point functions and successfully compare them to tba calculations . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that the delta functions leading to such terms arise from the use of infinite volume wavefunctions . if such wavefunctions are replaced instead with finite volume counterparts , the delta functions are regulated .",
    "for example , a pole in @xmath313 is changed as follows @xmath314 where @xmath315 is some sharply peaked function about @xmath316 which in the infinite volume limit evolves into a @xmath208-function",
    ". however the principal value of this regularized integral is zero . thus discarding the pole terms",
    "is justified in this sense . for terms that are ratios of infinitesimals",
    ", balog also demonstrates that such terms , once regularized , disappear in the infinite volume limit .",
    "in this section we review the derivation of the equations describing the exact free energy ( and hence the susceptibility ) of the @xmath0 sigma model together with its low temperature expansion .",
    "the exact description of the thermodynamics of the @xmath0 sigma model takes the form of a set of quantization conditions for the momenta , @xmath317 , of the excitations in the ground state . with @xmath318",
    ", we have the following condition @xcite : @xmath319 here @xmath320 are the rapidities of the other excitations in the ground state while the @xmath321 s mark out spin excitations above an originally polarized ground state .",
    "( the bethe ansatz construction begins with a completely polarized ground state of spin 1 excitations above which one then creates spin excitations ",
    "marked out by the @xmath322 s  in order to give the ground state the desired spin polarization . )",
    "@xmath141 is the total number of excitations in the ground state while @xmath13 is the number of spin excitations .",
    "the quantum number , @xmath182 , is then given by @xmath323 .",
    "the total energy of the ground state in a magnetic field is then equal to @xmath324 the analysis of these equations proceeds using the string hypothesis .",
    "the solutions of the above equations take the form @xmath325 that is the @xmath321 s are organized into ` complexes ' which share a real part , @xmath326 , the centre of the complex .",
    "in computing the free energy , we are interested in the continuum limit of the above equations .",
    "to arrive at this limit , we introduce densities per unit length , @xmath327 and @xmath328 , of respectively the @xmath329 s , and the centers , @xmath326 , of the complexes . we further introduce particle and hole densities by writing @xmath330 and @xmath331 .",
    "a particle density gives the probability that the ground state contains an excitation at a given rapidity , @xmath332 , while the hole density gives the converse probability that the excitation at the rapidity is not found in the ground state .",
    "equations describing these densities can be arrived at in a standard fashion ( see section 8.3 of @xcite for an analogous derivation in the case of the anderson model ) : @xmath333 where @xmath334 and @xmath335 denotes the convolution of these two functions : @xmath336 from these equations the free energy per unit length , @xmath337 , can be derived ( again see @xcite for details of an analogous derivation ) : @xmath338 here we have expressed the free energy of the system in terms of the dressed energies ( or pseudo - energies ) , @xmath339 , of the excitations .",
    "these functions give the energetic cost of making an excitation at a given rapidity taking into account the excitation s interactions with the other particles in the ground state .",
    "these equations are in agreement with @xcite where they were first written down and correct typos found in @xcite .    to derive the low temperature expansion of the free energy , we follow @xcite .",
    "we solve the above equations [ eviii ] through iteration .",
    "we write for each pseudo - energy , @xmath340 @xmath341 this expansion is such that @xmath342 is of @xmath343 . on the basis of ( [ eviv ] ) we can write the free energy as a series in @xmath344 : @xmath345 we will compute the @xmath346 terms of this expansion .",
    "the @xmath347 term of ( [ eviv ] ) is arrived at by neglecting the term involving @xmath348 in the equation for @xmath340 .",
    "if this is done , these equations reduce to @xmath349 they are then algebraic in nature and admit the following solution : @xmath350 at this order of the iteration , @xmath351 becomes @xmath352 and so @xmath353 clearly @xmath337 is of @xmath70 .    the next coefficient in the series ( [ eviv ] ) , @xmath354 , is found by substituting ( [ evviii ] ) into the equations for @xmath340 : @xmath355 to the order in @xmath65 to which we are working",

    "indeed @xcite goes on to compute @xmath361 and so corrections of @xmath362 to @xmath351 .",
    "the zero field susceptibility is given by @xmath363 using @xmath351 in ( [ evxiii ] ) and expanding the above expression to @xmath362 , we find @xmath364 where @xmath58 .",

    "rmk also thanks paul fendley for performing the numerical analysis of the exact tba equations .",
    "to compute the correlator , @xmath365 , we first consider the action of the thermal trace : @xmath366 keeping the first two terms leads us to @xmath367 expanding the denominator then gives us @xmath368 the term arising from the partition function is ill - defined as the state normalization is given by @xmath369 .",
    "however this term will be canceled by disconnected terms arising from @xmath370 .    to evaluate this expression we begin by computing the first term of the trace @xmath371 by inserting a resolution of the identity between the @xmath372 s : @xmath373 we only need to keep the lowest order term , @xmath374 , in this expansion ; _",
    "all other terms make no contribution to the susceptibility_. the terms corresponding to n even are identically zero ( by parity ) ; the remaining @xmath375 odd terms vanish in the low energy - low momentum limit of the corresponding spectral function .",
    "( we will return to this is a moment . )",
    "given that we can thus compute the entire contribution @xmath371 makes to the susceptibility , we will able to find an exact correspondence between the form factor computation and a low temperature expansion of the exact free energy . with the @xmath374 term",
    "we then have @xmath376 we have used crossing symmetry in the second line . from section 3.3 ,",
    "the form factor @xmath377 is given by @xmath378 then the lowest order contribution , @xmath379 , to the spin - spin correlator , @xmath380 , is given by @xmath381 fourier transforming in @xmath382 and @xmath383 and continuing @xmath384 yields , @xmath385 where @xmath386 is a modified bessel function .",
    "this has the expected small temperature behaviour , @xmath387 .",
    "let us consider further why the above computation gives the sole contribution to @xmath388 .",
    "the next potential contribution to this matrix element takes the form @xmath389 upon evaluation this expression produces two types of terms .",
    "the first is associated with the disconnected pieces of the matrix elements appearing in the above .",
    "an example of this type of term is @xmath390 as @xmath391 is a lorentz current , the term @xmath392 appears in the above .",
    "thus when the fourier transform , @xmath393 , is taken followed by the limit , @xmath394 , this term vanishes identically .",
    "the second type of term we must deal with in evaluating ( [ eaviiia ] ) takes the form @xmath395 and arises from the connected pieces of the matrix elements appearing in ( [ eaviiia ] ) . to evaluate this term we deform the contours @xmath396 via @xmath397 in doing so we deform through a number of poles whose residues we will pick up .",
    "evaluating these residues we again obtain something of the form ( [ eaviiib ] ) .",
    "as such , fourier transforming and taking the @xmath88 limit forces the term to vanish and ( [ eaviiia ] ) ends up making no contribution to the susceptibility . in the same way , it is easy then to convince oneself that terms involving an even greater number of particles similarly do not contribute to the static susceptibility .",
    "we now go ahead and compute the second term arising from performing the thermal trace , @xmath398 .",
    "we evaluate it as before by inserting a resolution of the identity between the two fields . in this case the only term that contributes is the @xmath399 term : @xmath400 allowing for the presence of disconnected terms , the matrix elements in the above expression take the form @xmath401 where @xmath402 refers to a connected form - factor .",
    "we now substitute ( [ eax ] ) into ( [ eaix ] ) and obtain the following after some lengthy but straightforward algebra @xmath403 although appearing exceedingly complicated , these terms dramatically simplify once we fourier transform .",
    "the first term , @xmath404 , on the r.h.s . of ( [ eaxi ] ) involves @xmath304 and so is ill - defined .",
    "however it precisely cancels the term arising from the evaluation of the partition function in ( [ eaiii ] ) , @xmath405 as is evident if a resolution of the identity is inserted between the two fields , @xmath391 , in the above and then truncated at the one - particle level .    having canceled off the @xmath304-terms we now look at terms that make a genuine contribution to the spin - spin correlator .",
    "we first consider the completely disconnected terms .",
    "fourier transforming @xmath406 and @xmath407 in time and space and then analytically continuing , @xmath408 , leads to @xmath409 where again @xmath386 is a standard bessel function .    to compute @xmath410 we need to evaluate the connected four - particle form factor . to do",
    "so we add small imaginary pieces to the rapidities where potential poles lurk and take only the finite piece .",
    "for example the first term of @xmath410 upon fourier transforming reduces to @xmath411 then to evaluate the connected form factor in this expression we write @xmath412 we evaluate this matrix element using the discussion in section iii.d , throwing away any poles in @xmath313 or @xmath208 together with terms of the form @xmath413 . expanding the form factor on the r.h.s . of ( [ eaxv ] ) in @xmath313 and @xmath208 by using ( [ eiiixxix ] ) leads to @xmath414 where @xmath415 is given in this case by @xmath416 discarding the pole terms ( the first set of terms on the r.h.s . of ( [ eaxvi ] ) ) and evaluating the remainder leaves us with the desired connected form factor @xmath417 combining ( [ eaxvia ] ) and ( [ eavi ] ) with ( [ eaxiv ] ) we find @xmath418 to arrive at the last line we have dropped terms polynomial in @xmath419 .",
    "this leads to errors of @xmath420 .",
    "the remaining three terms make equal contributions to @xmath410 .",
    "we thus finally have @xmath421 we note that in regulating the form factor for @xmath410 we do not allow the infinitesimal imaginary pieces to affect the spatial dependence of the form factor , i.e. we do not write @xmath422 if we were to do so we would find an additional term coming from expanding @xmath423 in @xmath313 and @xmath208",
    ". however generically such terms lead to a violation of translation invariance and as such should not be included .",
    "we moreover know that such terms would violate the equivalence of the form factor computation with the expression for the susceptibility coming the thermodynamic bethe ansatz .",
    "we go through a similar procedure with @xmath424 and find an identical result : @xmath425 .",
    "that we do so is significant .",
    "we might have approached the calculation equally validly by ordering the in and out states in the thermal trace and resolution of identity such that @xmath426 and @xmath427 ( and correspondingly multiplying the expressions in ( [ eaxi ] ) by 4 ) .",
    "if we had done so we would find that in this case @xmath428 and @xmath410 is twice its current value .",
    "of course both approaches must yield the same answer .",
    "but to do so we need @xmath425",
    ". given the regularization of the form factors one must do to compute @xmath424 , it is not a priori that this will be the case . that it is is a non - trivial check of our regularization procedure .",
    "the final term we must evaluate is @xmath429 .",
    "fourier transforming as before we find @xmath430 as the 4-particle form factors are proportional to @xmath431 ( the lorentz pre - factor for the matrix element ) one might believe it is immediate that this expression vanishes once the fourier transform , @xmath432 , is taken and so makes no contribution to the susceptibility .",
    "however the need to regulate the form factor leaves this ambiguous . nevertheless , after the regulation @xmath429 ends up making no contribution to the susceptibility .",
    "it will however make a contribution to the nmr relaxation rate . hence some of the details needed to compute @xmath429",
    "will be dealt with in the context of that computation ( see appendix b and section 2.c ) .",
    "in order to compute @xmath3 we must evaluate the correlator , @xmath433 the lowest order contribution arising from the evaluation of the thermal trace takes the form @xmath434 where @xmath435 is the spin of particle @xmath436 .",
    "we have assumed the field , h , is aligned along the 3-direction .",
    "although we perform the calculation at finite h , the form - factors themselves retain their @xmath44 form , a feature of the model s underlying integrability .",
    "finite h merely breaks the degeneracy of the triplet state with the consequent energy shifts seen above .",
    "for the purposes of this computation , we are interested in the regime @xmath132 .",
    "this permits setting @xmath437 to 1 , provided we are willing to tolerate errors of @xmath438 .",
    "performing then the sums , @xmath439 , over the different types of excitations leaves us with @xmath440 substituting the expression for the form - factors , @xmath441 , from section 3 into the above , and then performing the necessary fourier transform , leaves us with @xmath442 for @xmath443 this reduces to @xmath444 , where @xmath445 is euler s constant .",
    "this is the result found in @xcite - a logarithmic dependence on @xmath103 indicative of ballistic transport .",
    "the next order in the computation , essentially computing terms of @xmath118 , is of the form @xmath446 here we have introduced the same notation employed to evaluate the second order contribution to the susceptibility .",
    "the definitions of @xmath447 are the same as those in ( [ eaxi ] ) but for changing @xmath391 to @xmath448 and shifting energies by a zeeman term . as in the susceptibility computation",
    ", @xmath449 is an ill - defined term proportional to @xmath304 , but is cancelled off by similar terms coming from the partition function .",
    "similarly , @xmath406 and @xmath407 are disconnected terms related to @xmath55 .",
    "they give a contribution of the form @xmath450 if we were to add similarly disconnected terms coming from matrix elements with a greater number of particle numbers , we would find a resummation of the form : @xmath451 this type of resummation was discussed in section 2.a.2 .",
