    "<S> material properties depend sensitively on picometer scale atomic displacements introduced by local chemical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> direct real - space , high spatial - resolution measurements of this compositional variation and corresponding distortion can provide new insights into materials behavior at the atomic scale . using aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with advanced imaging methods , we observed atom column specific , picometer - scale displacements induced by local chemistry in a complex oxide solid solution . </S>",
    "<S> displacements predicted from density functional theory were found to correlate with the observed experimental trends . </S>",
    "<S> further analysis of bonding and charge distribution were used to clarify the mechanisms responsible for the detected structural behavior . by extending the experimental electron microscopy measurements to previously inaccessible length scales , we identified correlated atomic displacements linked to bond differences within the complex oxide structure .    </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers : :    68.37.ma , 71.15.mb    complex oxides exhibit a range of properties including ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity @xcite , high temperature superconductivity @xcite , and thermoelectricity @xcite , which are intimately linked to picometer - scale atomic shifts within the crystal structure @xcite . for oxide </S>",
    "<S> solid solutions , the interaction between atomic species can modify functionality through these structural distortions . to date , however , these displacements are often difficult to unambiguously detect by conventional means @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> rather , direct real - space measurements with picometer precision in combination with theoretical investigations can provide insights into the origin of fine scale atomic displacements .    </S>",
    "<S> atomic resolution electron microscopy has served as an indispensable tool for the real - space structural analysis of materials , e.g.  ferroelectrics @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> high - angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy ( haadf stem ) has proven pivotal for structural analysis as the image intensities scale approximately as the square of the atomic numbers ( z ) present @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this enables direct identification of light and heavy elements within a structure , even single dopant atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> crystallographic analysis using stem , however , has been stymied by sample drift and noise that traditionally limit measurement precision to about 5 - 10 pm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this challenge hindered the possibility to directly connect complex structural responses to local chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> the recent introduction of revolving stem @xcite and non - ridged image registration @xcite have now overcome these challenges . </S>",
    "<S> the picometer precise measurements enabled by these techniques are now opening a new avenue to study crystallography with the combination of interpretability , chemical sensitivity , and directly in real - space .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we select ( la@xmath0sr@xmath1)(al@xmath2ta@xmath3)o@xmath4 ( lsat ) as a model oxide solid solution to study atomic displacements in a complex chemical environment . the lsat crystal poses a particularly challenging test case as atomic forces resulting from the intricate local chemical environment lead to structural distortion . </S>",
    "<S> lsat adopts the cubic perovskite abo@xmath4 structure ( space group @xmath5 ) with the corners occupied by ( la , sr ) , ( al , ta ) located at the cube center , and the oxygen anions positioned on the faces ( fig .  [ </S>",

    "<S> are observed that contain either la / sr , al / ta / o , or exclusively o. for convenience in referencing the @xmath6 stem images , we define two distinct cation containing sub - lattices : the a sub - lattice containing la and sr , and the b sub - lattice consisting of al and ta with overlapping oxygen anions .    as a critical first step to identifying the underlying structure of the solid solution , measurement of the elemental distribution within lsat </S>",
    "<S> is required , and is accomplished through atomic resolution energy dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( eds ) ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1]b ) @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . the stronger al x - ray signal at the darkest atom columns in the haadf image ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1]c ) confirm that these positions are al - rich compared to other b sub - lattice columns . </S>",
    "<S> this strong contrast results from the large atomic number difference between al ( z = 13 ) and ta ( z = 73 ) , compared to sr ( z = 38 ) and la ( z = 57 ) . to aid visual inspection , </S>",
    "<S> particularly strong and weak b sub - lattice atom columns are identified in figure [ fig : figure1]c for those within @xmath7 of the average b column intensity .    as shown in the revstem dataset ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1]c through e ) , the compositional fluctuation and non - uniform lattice distortion are directly observed . </S>",
    "<S> this is quantified through the average nearest - like - neighbor ( nln ) distances for the two distinct sub - lattices ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1]d and e ) . in figures  [ fig : figure1 ] d and e , each column is outlined by the average displacement with the extreme contraction and expansion colored as blue or red , respectively , while minor distortion is colored aqua / green / yellow . </S>",
    "<S> inspection of these maps reveals a wide distribution for the a - a nln distances ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1]d ) , while a much narrower distribution is found for the b - b nln distances ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1]e ) . analysis of the average a - a distances uncovers that significant deviations are correlated with the b site intensity ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , there is a tendency for significant contraction around the dark al - rich atom columns while the bright ta - rich columns correspond to expansion .    to emphasize these trends , </S>",
    "<S> the average nln distances around each b and a atom column are plotted against the opposing atom column sub - lattice intensity ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2 ] a and b respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> the average a - a distance shows moderate linear correlation with the b atom column intensity ( @xmath8 ) , while the b sub - lattice distances show little to no correlation to a intensity ( @xmath9 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these trends point to the strong influence of the atomic displacements mediated by fluctuations in local chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the scatter in these plots is a direct consequence of the statistical nature of the solid solution alloy and each measurement point represents the average local distortion . </S>",
    "<S> these results are also critically relevant across a range of oxides , where previous theoretical investigations have indicated that the ferroelectricity in pb(ti , zr)o@xmath4 results when a sub - lattice ( pb ) cations contract towards ti and away from zr on the b sub - lattice @xcite . similar behavior has been predicted for bi(mg , ti)o@xmath4 where the b sub - lattice cations have different preferred charge states and results in a ferroelectric phase transition @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to bi(mg , ti)o@xmath4 or pb(ti , zr)o@xmath4 , the lsat solid solution creates a complex local charge environment on _ both _ cation sub - lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the a sub - lattice contains la@xmath10 and sr@xmath11 , the b sub - lattice contains al@xmath10 and ta@xmath12 , and o@xmath13 neutralizes the total charge . to understand the nature of bonding and the origin of forces in this complex system that drive the aforementioned distortions , we turn to density functional theory ( dft ) . from dft the charge of cations in the unrelaxed structure , as measured by bader s method @xcite , reveals that the atoms do not reside in their full ionization states . </S>",
    "<S> rather , la , sr , al , and ta cations are determined to have positive charges of 2.04 @xmath14 0.02 , 1.56 @xmath14 0.01 , 2.43 @xmath14 0.01 , and 2.54 @xmath14 0.01 @xmath15 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the small standard deviations indicate that all cations are insensitive to their local chemical environment . </S>",
    "<S> ta atoms have the most significant deviation from their formal charge . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to ta - o bonds having the most significant covalent character as seen in the higher concentration of electrons between ta - o atoms in figure  [ fig : figure1]a .    the oxygen anions exhibit an average charge of @xmath16 @xmath15 but have a much larger standard deviation , which indicates a higher sensitivity to the local chemical environment . </S>",
    "<S> the identity of the neighboring b sub - lattice cations are found to determine the charge of oxygen . separating the oxygen charge into groups based on the possible combinations , the three distinct local oxygen charges are : -1.51 @xmath14 0.01 @xmath15 for al - o - al , -1.33 @xmath14 0.02 @xmath15 for al - o - ta , and -1.23 @xmath14 0.02 @xmath15 for ta - o - ta . </S>",
    "<S> the small standard deviations indicate that the oxygen anions are uniquely identified within these three groups .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - uniform charge distribution in the ideal lattice leads to sizable forces on the atoms of up to @xmath174 ev /  , which are ultimately minimized through static displacements in the relaxed structure . in an effort to further confirm the origin of the forces </S>",
    "<S> as arising from the local charge distribution , we compare the hellmann - feynman forces from dft to those from coulomb s law using the bader charges and an ewald summation method . </S>",
    "<S> forces on atoms in the a sub - lattice derived from the ewald sum exhibit a minimum absolute percent error ( mape ) of 7% relative to the dft forces . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , forces on oxygen and b sub - lattice cations have higher mape of 102% and 53% , respectively , due to mixed ionic / covalent bonding .    </S>",
    "<S> the similarity of the hellmann - feynman forces and those from the ideal point charge coulombic picture for the a sub - lattice cations indicate a predominant ionic interaction between these atoms and the others within the alloy . </S>",
    "<S> la and sr are thus most sensitive to the local charge distribution , lack bond directionality , and are free to arbitrarily displace to minimize internal energy and reduce the large initial forces . ultimately , attractive interactions arise between the a sub - lattice cations and the oxygen anions , which have variable charge based on local chemistry . </S>",
    "<S> the dft charge analysis indicates that the most favorable attraction is between a sub - lattice cations and oxygen anions interacting with al ( i.e.  al - o - al or al - o - ta ) . </S>",
    "<S> further , relaxation of the atomic coordinates shows a tendency for contraction of a sub - lattice cations towards al rich b columns , consistent with the proposed mechanism and experimental measurements .    to provide analysis complementary to experiment , </S>",
    "<S> stem images were simulated using the atomic coordinates from the relaxed dft supercell . </S>",
    "<S> two factors are included for comparison with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> first , the coordinates are scaled from the dft lattice parameter of 3.93    to the experimental parameter of 3.87  . </S>",
    "<S> second , we include multiple rotations of the supercell tiled down the three @xmath6 directions to increase statistical sampling per atom column . </S>",
    "<S> the later is justified by the small displacements in the b sub - lattice .    from the stem simulations we determine the predicted nln distances for the structure viewed along @xmath6 as a function of neighboring column intensity ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2]c ) . to represent the atom column composition extremes , the measurements in figure [ fig : figure2]c include stem simulations of both the tiled structure and individual @xmath6 projections ( supplemental material @xcite figure 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted trends are consistent with the experimental observations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2]a and b ) , and the average nln distance outliers are associated with pure al or ta atom columns from the original untiled dft supercell . </S>",
    "<S> inspection of the simulated tiled structure ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure2]d ) , shows the same qualitative behavior as the experimental dataset ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1 ] d and e ) and predicts an a - a nln standard deviation of @xmath17 10 pm comparable to the experiment , @xmath17 7 pm . also in agreement , the predicted b - b average nln has a small standard deviation of @xmath17 2 pm , similar to the @xmath173 pm from experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement indicates that when the average projected distortions from stem are combined with dft , it becomes possible to quantitatively connect local chemical fluctuations with distortion .    to study structural correlations at longer length scales , @xmath18 like </S>",
    "<S> - neighbor distances are extracted across the entire image and used to construct a projected pair distribution function ( ppdf ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is schematically represented in figure  [ fig : figure3]a for @xmath19 . conceptually , these measurements are similar to the pair distribution function ( pdf ) extracted from from diffraction data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the measurements differ , however , in that ppdfs provide insight into the projected average distortion , are determined directly at the atomic scale , and can be separated according to each sub - lattice . while the ppdfs for a and b sub - lattices appear qualitatively similar ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : figure3]b ) , the standard deviation ( @xmath20 ) for the a - a nearest and second like - neighbors , as measured using the ppdf , are considerably larger than those for the b - b distances and are reported in figure [ fig : figure3]c .    </S>",
    "<S> extending the @xmath20 analysis across the image , the a @xmath18 like - neighbor also differ dramatically from the b sub - lattice in terms of trend ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> identical analysis was performed using a si single crystal to demonstrate that the measurement precision is consistently @xmath21 2 pm ( fig .   </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3]d , solid line ) . </S>",
    "<S> inspection of the first few like - neighbors of lsat reveals that @xmath22 increases as the distance between b sub - lattice columns increases , while @xmath23 increases initially and then decreases . </S>",
    "<S> the stark difference between the lsat trends , especially relative to the flat si @xmath20 , indicates the presence of correlated atomic distortion within lsat . to quantify the degree of correlation </S>",
    "<S> , we use the coefficient , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the contribution due to uncorrelated displacements at large pair distances . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is commonly employed for pdf analysis @xcite , but without near perfect imaging enabled by revstem , drift and noise would usually preclude extending precise distance measurements beyond a few angstroms ( one unit - cell ) in stem .    </S>",
    "<S> as shown in figure [ fig : figure3]e , the first few like - neighbors for the b sub - lattice exhibit strong , positive correlation while those for a show strong , negative correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the decreasing correlation for @xmath22 can be explained by the rigid cage introduced by b - o covalent bonding : cooperative distortion results in near neighbor distances that are more similar than those at longer range ( top schematic , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3]e ) . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , atypical negative correlation is observed for the a sub - lattice distortion . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior can be understood in the context of the local chemical fluctuation of the b sub - lattice . for al- or ta - rich atom columns , the surrounding a sub - lattice atoms contract inward or outward in opposite directions due to the local charge distribution ( bottom schematic , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure3]e ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a sub - lattice distortion is anti - correlated . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the second like - neighbor @xmath23 increases due to compounding distortion contributions from both @xmath26 and @xmath27 directions ( see further details of the correlation coefficient in the supplemental material @xcite ) .    through the power of picometer precise measurements in haadf revstem </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated that relationships between chemistry and local distortion can be directly interrogated with atomic scale spatial resolution . when combined with dft </S>",
    "<S> , these results offer additional insights to provide a complete mechanistic picture of unit - cell level structural displacements , which can be particularly important to the functionality of complex oxide solid solutions . the real - space measurement precision rivals that of diffraction determined pdfs , with the distinct advantage of exposing a rich set of real space structural and chemical information . </S>",
    "<S> this approach opens the doorway to new physical observations , as demonstrated here , and enable new opportunities to investigate property defining atomic structure . </S>"
