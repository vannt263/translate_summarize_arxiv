    "the no - cloning theorem states that quantum information can not be copied , i.e. there exists no quantum device whose input is an arbitrarily prepared quantum system and the output consists of two quantum systems whose individual states coincide with that of the input .",
    "this and other quantum no - go theorems play an important role in quantum information theory and there exist deep connections with problems in quantum cryptography such as that of eavesdropping . with applications in mind , it is more interesting to derive a quantitative version of the theorem which says how good an approximate cloning machine can do , by providing lower bounds for the error made by any such machine .",
    "the quality of the approximate clones can be judged either locally , by comparing the state of each individual clone with the input state , or globally by comparing the joint state of the approximate clones with that of independent perfect clones .",
    "note that , because the no - cloning theorem requires that each individual system has the same marginal state as the input , it is the local quality criterion which captures more of its flavor .",
    "however if we are interested in the joint state of the output then the global criterion is more useful as it takes into account the correlations between the systems .    before stating our cloning problem we would like to mention a few important results in this area and we refer to the review for a more detailed discussion .",
    "the problem of universal cloning for finite dimensional pure states was analyzed and solved in .",
    "interestingly , when the figure of merit is the supremum over all input states of the fidelity between the ideal and the approximate clones , it was shown that the same cloning machine is optimal from both the local and the global point of view .    in the case of continuos variables",
    "systems the gaussian states have received a special attention due to their importance in quantum optics , quantum communication and cryptography @xcite .",
    "problems in quantum information such as entanglement measures and quantum channels have been partially solved by restricting to the framework of gaussian states and operations . for coherent states",
    "the optimal cloning problem has been investigated in under the restriction of gaussian transformation .",
    "the question whether the optimal cloning map is indeed gaussian has been answered positively in the case of global figure of merit with fidelity , and negatively for the individual figure of merit .    as noticed in ,",
    "the area of optimal cloning for mixed states is virtually open partly due to the technical difficulties compared with the pure state case .",
    "however we should mention here the phenomenon of `` super - broadcasting '' which allows not only perfect @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( local ) cloning of mixed states but even purification , if @xmath0 is large enough and the input states are sufficiently mixed .",
    "this happens however at the expense of creating big correlations between the individual clones , just as in the case of classical copying .",
    "quantum cloning shows some similarities to quantum state estimation , for example the pure state case is easier than the mixed case in both contexts .",
    "recently it has been shown that local cloning for pure states is asymptotically equivalent to estimation @xcite .",
    "this paper makes another step in this direction by pointing out that global cloning has a natural statistical interpretation .",
    "the statistics literature dedicated to the classical version of this problem @xcite has been an inspiration for this paper and may prove to be useful in future quantum investigations .",
    "the problem which we investigate is that of optimal @xmath2 to @xmath3 cloning of _ mixed _ gaussian states using a _ global _ figure of merit . we show that the optimal cloner is gaussian and is similar to the optimal one for the pure state case .",
    "our figure of merit is based on the _ norm distance _ rather than fidelity , the latter being more cumbersome to calculate in the case of mixed states .",
    "however the result holds as well with other figures of merit such as total variation distance between the distributions obtained by performing quantum homodyne tomography measurements .    in quantum state estimation",
    "it has been shown that the family of mixed gaussian states appears as asymptotic limit of multiple mixed qubit states .",
    "based on this result it can be proved that the problem of @xmath0 to @xmath4 global cloning of mixed qubit states is asymptotically equivalent to that of @xmath2 to @xmath3 cloning of mixed gaussian states which is addressed in this paper . in deriving our result",
    "we have transformed the optimal cloning problem into an optimal amplifying problem and then used covariance arguments to restrict the optimization to the set of mixed number states of the idler of a non - degenerate parametric amplifier . the argument leading to the conclusion that the optimal state of the idler is the vacuum ,",
    "is based on the notion of _ stochastic ordering _ which is also used in deriving the solution to the classical problem of optimal gaussian cloning .    in section [ sec.ntom ]",
    "we extend the solution of the @xmath2 to @xmath3 cloning problem to the case of optimal @xmath0 to @xmath1 cloning of mixed gaussian states .",
    "the transformation involves three steps : one first concentrates the @xmath0 modes in one by means of a unitary fourier transform , then amplifies this mode with a phase - insensitive linear amplifier with gain @xmath5 , and finally the amplified state is distributed over the @xmath1 output modes by using another fourier transform with @xmath6 ancillary modes prepared in a thermal equilibrium state identical to that of the input .",
    "we consider the problem of optimal cloning for a family of gaussian states of a quantum oscillator , namely the displaced thermal equilibrium states with a given , known temperature .",
    "let @xmath7 be the creation and annihilation operators acting on the hilbert space @xmath8 and satisfying the commutation relations @xmath9= \\mathbf{1}$ ] , and let @xmath10 be a thermal equilibrium state where @xmath11 is related to the temperature by @xmath12 , and @xmath13 represent the fock basis vectors of @xmath0-photons states .",
    "let @xmath14 be the displaced thermal states where @xmath15 and consider the quantum statistical models : @xmath16 in the next subsection we will give a statistical interpretation to the optimal figure of merit for cloning as a kind of gap ( deficiency ) between the less informative model @xmath17 and the more informative one @xmath18 .",
    "the aim of 1 to 2 global cloning is to transform the state @xmath19 into @xmath20 without knowing @xmath21 .",
    "this is however impossible , and this fact has nothing to do with the quantum no - cloning theorem which is about local cloning .",
    "in fact the same phenomenon occurs in classical statistics : given one gaussian random variable whose distribution has unknown center , it is impossible to produce two _ independent _ variables with the same distribution . in both classical and quantum set - ups",
    ", if this was possible one could determine exactly the displacement by first cloning the state to an infinite number of independent states and then estimating the displacement using statistical methods .",
    "thus we will try to perform an approximate cloning transformation which is optimal with respect to a given figure of merit .",
    "we consider a _",
    "criterion rather than a local , individual one .",
    "the classical version of this problem has been previously considered in mathematical statistics @xcite and we will adopt here the same terminology by defining the _ deficiency _ of the model @xmath17 with respect to the model @xmath18 as @xmath22 where the infimum is taken over all possible cloning maps @xmath23 with @xmath24 denoting the space of states ( density matrices ) on @xmath8 and @xmath25 is a completely positive and trace preserving map .",
    "the norm one of a trace class operator is defined as @xmath26 .",
    "we are looking for a map @xmath27 satisfying @xmath28 this figure of merit is very natural from the statistical point of view and can be related with the fidelity through the two sided inequalities @xmath29 although the fidelity is a popular figure of merit , it is more difficult to handle in the case of mixed states .",
    "note also that we do not take any average with respect to a prior distribution over the unknown parameter but just consider the cloner which performs best with respect to _ all _ @xmath21 , i.e. we are in a minimax framework as in .      in the classical case",
    "the problem of optimal gaussian cloning is equivalent to that of `` amplifying '' the location of the center of a gaussian variable .",
    "we will show that this is also the case in the quantum setup by proving a fairly simple lemma allowing us to simplify the problem and make the connection with the theory of linear amplifiers beautifully exposed in @xcite .",
    "let us start with the classical case and suppose that we draw a real number @xmath30 from the normal distribution @xmath31 with unknown center @xmath32 and fixed and known variance @xmath33 .",
    "we would like to devise some statistical procedure ( for this purpose we may use an additional source of randomness ) whose input is @xmath30 and the output is a pair of independent clones @xmath34 , each having distribution @xmath31 . let us assume for the moment that this can actually be done and note that by performing the invertible transformation @xmath35 no statistical information is lost and moreover the two newly obtained terms are independent , @xmath36 has distribution @xmath37 while @xmath38 does not contain any statistical information about @xmath39 .",
    "conversely , starting from an `` amplified '' version of @xmath30 , that is a variable @xmath40 with distribution @xmath37 , one can recover the independent clones by adding an subtracting an independent @xmath41 variable @xmath42 : @xmath43 in fact this is nothing else than the classical analogue of a 50 - 50 beamsplitter where @xmath44 should be replaced by independent input modes carrying gaussian states , and @xmath45 can be seen as the output fields .",
    "the moral of this is that perfect cloning would be equivalent to perfect amplifying if any of them was possible , but in fact the two problems also are equivalent when we content ourselves with finding the optimal solution .",
    "we will prove this now in the quantum framework .",
    "let @xmath46 be a completely positive , trace preserving channel and define the figure of merit for @xmath47 amplification @xmath48 and let @xmath49 be the optimal figure of merit .    [ lemma.cloning-amplifier ] if @xmath50 is an optimal 1 to 2 cloning map then the map @xmath51 is an optimal @xmath47 amplifier , where @xmath52 is the beamsplitter transformation which in the heisenberg picture is given by the linear transformation @xmath53 acting on the creation and annihilation operators of the two modes .",
    "conversely , if @xmath54 is an optimal amplifier , then the channel @xmath55 is optimal for cloning , and in particular @xmath56 .",
    "_ let @xmath54 be an optimal amplifier , i.e. @xmath57 , and @xmath25 the corresponding cloning map , then @xmath58 now let us suppose that there exists another clonig map @xmath59 with @xmath60 , then the corresponding amplifier @xmath61 satisfies @xmath62 but",
    "this is in contradiction with the definition of the optimal figure of merit for amplification .",
    "a similar argument can be applied in the other direction .      as in other statistical problems",
    "the search for an optimal solution can be simplified if we can restrict the optimization set by means of a covariance argument .",
    "if the cloning map @xmath25 has the property that if we first displace the input and then apply @xmath25 , is equivalent to first applying @xmath25 and then displacing the outputs by the same amount , then we say that @xmath25 is ( displacement ) _ covariant _ : @xmath63 for all @xmath64 and @xmath65 . by convexity of the @xmath66 distance we have @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the `` mean with respect to @xmath21 '' , the analogue of averaging with respect to an invariant probability measure for the case of compact spaces .",
    "thus the mean @xmath69 is at least as good as the initial channel @xmath25 .",
    "there is a technical point here concerning the fact that @xmath69 may be singular as it is the case for example if @xmath25 maps all states in a fixed one then @xmath70 which is not trace preserving .",
    "a more detailed analysis @xcite shows however that such cases can be excluded and one can restrict attention to proper covariant and trace preserving channels .",
    "it can be shown that the general form of a covariant cloning map is given in the heisenberg picture by the linear transformations between the input mode @xmath71 and the output modes @xmath72 and @xmath73 : @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 are two additional modes whose joint state determines the action of the cloning map .",
    "the covariance property can be cast in the amplifier framework as well : a map @xmath54 is a covariant amplifier if @xmath77 for all @xmath65 and @xmath64 . as shown in lemma [ lemma.cloning-amplifier ] an optimal cloner",
    "can be transformed into an optimal amplifier by using a 50 - 50 beamsplitter to recombine the 2 clones and then keeping one of the outgoing modes .",
    "for covariant cloning maps as described above in the heisenberg picture , this leads to the family of covariant amplifiers ( see appendix ) with @xmath78 : @xmath79 where the mode @xmath76 has been eliminated and the amplifier depends only on the state of the mode @xmath80 . taking this into account , we will analyze the optimality problem in its formulation as optimal amplification .",
    "we will often use the fact that a particular covariant amplifier @xmath54 is in one to one correspondence with a state @xmath81 of the mode @xmath82 as specified by the above linear transformation in the heisenberg picture , and we emphasize this by writing @xmath83 .    by using a further covariance argument we will show that the search for optimal amplifier can be restricted to states @xmath81 which are mixtures of number states , i.e. states which are diagonal in the fock vectors basis . indeed for any displacement covariant amplifier @xmath54 we have @xmath84 let @xmath85 be the phase transformation with @xmath86 the number operator of the mode @xmath82 , and define similar phase transformations for the modes @xmath71 and @xmath87 .",
    "the amplifier @xmath54 is covariant with respect to phase transformations if @xmath88 it is now easy to check that if @xmath89 then @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , from we deduce that @xmath92 because the state @xmath93 is invariant under phase transformations and thus @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 is the phase averaged state @xmath81 , i.e. a diagonal density matrix in the number operator eigenbasis . the rest of the paper deals with the problem of finding the optimal diagonal state for the mode @xmath82 .",
    "let us consider an arbitrary diagonal state @xmath97 of the mode @xmath82 , and denote by @xmath98 the coefficients of the thermal equilibrium state @xmath99 of the @xmath71 mode .",
    "the state of the mode @xmath87 is itself diagonal and its coefficients can be written as @xmath100 with fixed @xmath101 coefficients having a complicated combinatorial expression .",
    "the optimal amplifier state @xmath102 satisfies @xmath103 the problem has been now reduced to the following `` classical '' one : given a convex family @xmath104 of discrete probability distributions on @xmath105 and an additional probability distribution @xmath106 which does not belong to @xmath107 , find the closest point in @xmath107 with respect to the @xmath108 distance",
    ". in general such an optimization problem may not have an explicit solution but in our case the notion of stochastic ordering is a key tool in finding the optimum .",
    "let @xmath109 and @xmath110 be two probability distributions over @xmath105 .",
    "we say that @xmath106 is stochastically smaller than @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) if @xmath113    the following lemma is a key technical result which will allow us to identify the optimal amplifier map .",
    "[ lemma.stoch.ordering ] assume that the mode @xmath71 is prepared in the thermal equilibrium state @xmath93 , and the mode @xmath82 in an arbitrary diagonal state @xmath81",
    ". then the following stochastic ordering holds : @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the distribution of the mode @xmath87 defined in and @xmath116 is the vacuum state .",
    "_ we will prove the result in two steps .",
    "first we show that the statement can be reduced to the case where the input state is the vacuum rather than a thermal equilibrium state @xmath93 .",
    "then we prove the lemma for the mode @xmath71 in the vacuum state .    in quantum optics",
    "the equation describes a non - degenerate parametric amplifier whose general input - output transformation has the form @xmath117 where @xmath118 represents the time and @xmath119 is a susceptibility constant . if both @xmath120 and @xmath121 modes are prepared in the vacuum state then each of the outputs separately will be in the thermal equilibrium state @xmath122 .",
    "this means that we can consider that our input mode @xmath71 is one of the _ outputs _ of a parametric amplifier with @xmath123 .",
    "thus @xmath124 which together with gives @xmath125 where @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the right side of the last equation can be interpreted as follows : the modes @xmath121 and @xmath82 are combined using a beamsplitter with transmitivity @xmath25 and one of the emerging beams denoted @xmath129 is further used together with the mode @xmath120 , as inputs of a parametric amplifier characterized by the coefficient @xmath130 . by hypothesis we assumed that the mode @xmath82 is in state @xmath81 , and by construction the mode @xmath121 is in the vacuum , thus the state of @xmath129 is given by the well known binomial formula @xcite @xmath131 the only property which we need here is that @xmath132 is the vacuum state if and only if @xmath81 is the vacuum state . in conclusion , by introducing the additional modes @xmath120 and @xmath121 we have transfered the `` impurity '' of the thermal equilibrium state from the mode @xmath71 to the mode @xmath129 , and the stochastic ordering statement can be now reformulated in our original notations as follows : the mode @xmath71 is prepared in the vacuum , and the mode @xmath82 is prepared in a state @xmath132 which is equal to the vacuum if and only if @xmath81 is the vacuum .",
    "in addition , the relation should be replaced by @xmath133 under the assumption that @xmath71 is in the vacuum , we proceed with the second step of the proof . because stochastic ordering is preserved by taking convex combinations",
    ", we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath134 for @xmath135 .",
    "the following formula gives a computable expression of the output two - modes vector state of the amplifier @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 . by tracing over the mode",

    "we can compute @xmath150 where @xmath151 and thus the integer @xmath144 is given by the integer part of the @xmath145 . in conclusion @xmath152",
    "we arrive now to the main result of the paper .",
    "we will show that amplifier @xmath153 whose output is closest to the desired state state , is that corresponding to @xmath154 .",
    "intuitively this happens because the `` target '' distribution @xmath111 is geometrically decreasing and the closest to it in the family @xmath115 is the output which is the least `` spread '' .",

    "as discussed in section [ sec.covariance ] , we can restrict to covariant amplifiers and the figure of merit in this case is simply @xmath167 , thus the optimal amplifier is @xmath168 .",
    "moreover , by the equivalence between optimal cloning and optimal amplification we also obtain the optimal cloning map ( see lemma [ lemma.cloning-amplifier ] ) .",
    "the optimal 1 to 2 cloning figure of merit is @xmath169 with @xmath144 as in lemma [ lemma.distance ] .",

    "we comment on the optimal figures of merit in the two cases as function of the parameter @xmath12 .",
    "it is well known that an arbitrary state @xmath170 of a quantum harmonic oscillator has an alternative representation as a function @xmath171 called the wigner function . in the case of the family of displaced thermal equilibrium states",
    "the wigner function is a two dimensional gaussian @xcite @xmath172 with variance @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "we have shown that the best quantum amplifier produces a gaussian state with @xmath175 or in terms of the variance @xmath176 which implies that for any @xmath177 we have the relation @xmath178 which indicates the least noisy amplification according to in the fundamental theorem for phase - insensitive amplifiers @xcite .",
    "let us consider now the classical problem of gaussian cloning as discussed in the beginning of subsection [ subsec.cloningvsamplifying ] : given a gaussian random variable @xmath179 with distribution @xmath31 , we want to produce a pair @xmath180 of independent clones of @xmath30 . by using the equivalence between the cloning and the amplification problems ,",
    "the task is equivalent to that of producing a variable @xmath40 with distribution @xmath37 , and the optimal solution to this problem @xcite is simply to take @xmath181 !",
    "we note that in the classical case the variance of the output is _ always _ equal to the double of the variance of the input , while in the quantum case the output `` noise '' is always higher due to the unitarity conditions imposed by quantum mechanics @xcite , and we recuperate the factor 2 in the high temperature limit .    in the classical case",
    "one can deduce by a simple scaling argument that the classical figure of merit does not depend on the variance of the gaussian but only on the amplifying factor , and in our case it takes the value @xmath182 . as expected , the quantum figure of merit is larger than the classical one to which it converges in the limit of high temperature , @xmath183 .",
    "the upper line in figure [ fig.cloning ] represents the optimal figure of merit @xmath184 as function of @xmath185 .",
    "an interesting feature of this function is that it appears to have discontinuities in the first derivative precisely at the values of @xmath185 for which the `` crossing point '' @xmath144 makes a jump ( see lemma [ lemma.distance ] ) .    for comparison",
    "we have also plotted the norm one distance between the corresponding gaussian wigner functions which does not seem to show any roughness .",
    "the results which we obtained for optimal @xmath2 to @xmath3 cloning can be easily extended to the case of optimal cloning of @xmath0 to @xmath1 cloning of mixed gaussian states .",
    "the idea is to first `` concentrate '' the state @xmath186 of the input into a single mode by means of a unitary transformation followed by discarding the uninteresting @xmath187 modes .",

    "the unitary transformations are the fourier transforms : @xmath190 where @xmath191 are the input modes and @xmath192 are the output modes .",
    "the amplifying part is described by the covariant map @xmath193 where @xmath82 is an additional mode prepared in a diagonal state @xmath81 as in the @xmath2 to @xmath3 case , and @xmath194 after amplification the second unitary transformation is performed on @xmath195 and the ancillary modes @xmath196 prepared in the state @xmath93 .",
    "an obvious extension of lemma [ lemma.cloning-amplifier ] holds in this case as well , showing the equivalence of optimal cloning and optimal amplification .",
    "similarly , lemma [ lemma.stoch.ordering ] and theorem [ th.main ] hold in general for any amplifying factor @xmath197 and we arrive to the conclusion that the optimal amplifier is given by the transformation described in equation with the idler mode @xmath82 in the vacuum state .",
    "an interesting fact is that our transformations are similar to those of optimal @xmath0 to @xmath1 broadcasting with the exception that in the last step of the procedure different ancillary states are used : the optimal state for broadcasting is the vacuum while for global cloning it is same thermal equilibrium state @xmath93 which characterizes the family .",
    "we have constructed an optimal 1 to 2 cloning map for the family of displaced thermal equilibrium states of a fixed , known temperature .",

    "the amplification step uses a non - degenerate linear amplifier with idler prepared in the vacuum state .",
    "the cloning step uses a beamsplitter and another ancillary mode in thermal equilibrium state with the same temperature as the input .",
    "computations which have not been included here indicate that the optimal cloning map remains unchanged under global figures of merit using different `` distances '' between states .",
    "the local version of the optimal cloning problem would probably lead to a non - gaussian optimum as it is the case with coherent states .",
    "the equivalence between cloning and amplifying can be extended to an arbitrary number @xmath0 of input states and number of clones @xmath1 , as well as the proof of the optimal amplifier . in the case",
    "@xmath198 , the first step is the concentration into one mode by means of a unitary fourier transform , followed by amplification with gain factor @xmath189 , and distribution into @xmath1 output modes using another fourier transform .",

    "for example in the case of a family of thermal equilibrium states with unknown temperature , one may need to perform an additional estimation of the thermal states in the last step of the cloning which requires ancillary modes prepared in the equilibrium state @xmath93 .    finally , the key ingredient in our proof was the notion of stochastic ordering which is worth investigating more closely in the context of quantum statistics .",
