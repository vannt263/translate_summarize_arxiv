    "the massive globular cluster ( gc ) ngc2808 is one of the most intriguing objects in the context of multiple stellar populations .",
    "the most astonishing feature of its color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) is the presence of five distinct sequences of main - sequence ( ms ) , and red - giant - branch ( rgb ) stars ( @xcite ; @xcite  hereafter  ,",
    "hereafter  ) and at least four distinct horizontal - branch ( hb ) segments .",
    "spectroscopy of bright rgb stars has revealed an extreme chemical composition with extended na - o (; ; @xcite ) and mg - al @xcite anticorrelations .",
    "the distinct sequences in the cmd of ngc2808 correspond to multiple stellar populations with light element abundance variations and different helium content .",
    "in particular , the three most evident mss discovered by @xcite , namely red , middle , and blue ms ( rms , mms , and bms ) have been interpreted with three stellar populations with primordial helium abundance ( y@xmath10.25 ) and with extreme values of y@xmath10.32 , y@xmath10.38 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ) .",
    "large helium enhancement have been also inferred from spectroscopy of hb stars ( @xcite ) and by the analysis of chromospheric lines in spectra of rgb stars .",
    "the formation and evolution of stellar populations in gcs have been widely investigated by several authors ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . the fraction of stars in each population , their radial distribution , chemical composition , mass function and dynamics are amongst the diagnostics commonly used to constraint the various scenarios . in particular , the radial distribution of stellar populations can provide information on the series of events that led from massive clouds in the early universe to the present day gcs with their multiple stellar populations .",
    "indeed clusters with long relaxation times may still keep information of the initial conditions of their stellar populations .",
    "theoretical models and simulations by @xcite predict that stars enhanced in helium and sodium are more centrally concentrated than stellar populations with primordial helium and oxygen abundance .",
    "this scenario is in agreement with observational studies on some gcs ( e.g.47tuc and @xmath3cen , @xcite , , @xcite , @xcite ; m2 , m3 , m5 , m13 , m15 , m53 , m92 , ; ngc362 , ; ngc3201 , ; ngc2419 , @xcite ; ngc6388 and ngc6441 , @xcite ) while in other cases the multiple stellar populations share the same radial distribution ( e.g.ngc1851 , ngc6121 ( m4 ) , ngc6362 , and ngc6752 , see ; @xcite ; ) .    in this paper",
    "we exploit proprietary data from the wide field channel of the advanced camera for surveys ( wfc / acs ) and the ultraviolet and visual channel of the wide field camera iii ( uvis / wfc3 ) to investigate for the first time the radial distribution of the multiple mss in ngc2808 .",
    "we also show the results of a simple n - body simulations aimed at illustrating and providing some insight on the possible spatial mixing and dynamical history of this cluster .",
    "this paper is part of the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) uv legacy survey of galactic globular clusters that is a project to investigate 57 galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) through the filters f275w , f336w and f438w of uvis / wfc3 ( go-13297 , pi.g.piotto ,",

    "[ sec : data ] , due to stellar crowding , the triple ms is not clearly visibile in the very central regions of ngc2808 and we have no information on the population ratio in the innermost 0.75 arcmin . in order to extend the study of the radial distribution of multiple stellar populations to the central regions , we have exploited the results from .    in that work ,",
    "we have analyzed multi - wavelength photometry of ngc2808 as part of the uv legacy survey of galactic globular clusters from go-13297 and go-10775 .",
    "we have separated at least five distinct populations that we name a , b , c , d and e. the five populations are clearly visible along the rgb in the entire analyzed field of view , which corresponds to the inner field analyzed in this paper .",
    "specifically , populations d and e correspond to the mms and the bms identified by @xcite , while populations a , b , and c are associated to the rms .",

    "the fraction of rms stars slightly decreases in the central field to about 53% , where it is similar to the fraction of rgb-(a@xmath52b@xmath52c ) .",

    "in contrast , the fraction of mms- plus bms - stars seems to increase when moving from the cluster outskirts to the center , and both the blue and the middle ms are more centrally concentrated than the rms .",
    "we note , that one of the main disadvantages of the analysis illustrated in the upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : risu ] is that , in some cases , distinct fields cover the same radial interval and the large size of each bin has the effect of diluting and hiding in part any existing radial gradient . in order to further explore the radial distribution of the multiple stellar populations in ngc2808 and better identify the presence and strength of radial gradients ,",
    "it is necessary to use a finer and non - overlapping binning .    in order to further investigate the radial distribution of multiple stellar populations in ngc2808 we have divided the stars studied in this paper into seven groups with different radial distance from the cluster center and calculated the population ratio in each region",

    "this result is in general qualitative agreement with the predictions of multiple - population cluster formation models according to which second - generation ( 2 g ) stars should form more concentrated than the initial first - generation ( 1 g ) population .    because of the effects of dynamical evolution on the structural properties of the various stellar populations , a direct connection between the current observed properties and those predicted by cluster formation models is not straightforward .",
    "the long - term cluster dynamical evolution will gradually weaken the initial radial gradient in the fraction of 2 g stars ( see e.g.@xcite ) until complete spatial mixing when no memory of the initial differences is preserved and all the populations share the same spatial distribution .    as discussed in the intoduction",
    ", a few observational studies have found clusters still retaining memory of the initial differences in the spatial distribution of 1 g and 2 g populations while others appear to have reached the phase when different populations are completely mixed .",
    "for those clusters for which a radial gradient in the fraction of 2 g stars is still present , the strength of the current observed radial gradient provides a lower limit on what must have been a stronger initial gradient .",
    "a complete and detailed model for any specific individual cluster is a very challenging and computationally expensive task ( see e.g.@xcite , @xcite ) ; the presence of multiple populations with the additional complexities related to their formation and dynamical history further complicates this task .",
    "this is well beyond the scope of the goals of this paper and is deferred to future investigations . here , in order to illustrate the process of spatial mixing of multiple stellar populations and provide some initial insight on the possible dynamical history leading to the gradient found in our analysis we present the results of a simple n - body simulation focussing our attention on the two - body relaxation - driven long - term evolution of the spatial distributions of the 1 g and 2 g population .",
    "we started our simulation with 50000 particles with the 1 g and the 2 g populations each having half of the total mass of the system and a range of stellar masses equal to those expected at about 12 gyr for a system with a @xcite stellar imf .",
    "both populations are characterized by a @xcite density profile with central dimensionless potential @xmath94 but the 2 g population is initially concentrated in the inner regions of the cluster and has a half - mass radius about 4.5 times smaller than that of the 1 g population .",

    "@xcite further analyzed the radial distribution of hb stars in ngc2808 and suggested that red - hb stars are less centrally concentrated than the remaining hb stars ; although their conclusion is significant only at @xmath110 level , it suggests the presence of a gradient consistent with that we find in our analysis .",
