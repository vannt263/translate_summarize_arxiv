    "<S> the alumina crucible was welded in a ta tube and then sealed in an evacuated quartz ampoule . </S>",
    "<S> the quartz ampoule was slowly heated up to 1173  k and held for 24 h in a furnace , followed by cooling down to 923 k at a rate of 2 k / h . </S>",
    "<S> arpes measurements were performed at the i05-arpes beamline at diamond light source , uk . </S>",
    "<S> straight stick - like samples with typical sizes of @xmath22000x200x200@xmath12 m were selected and prepared for arpes measurements with the standard top - post cleavage method in ultrahigh vacuum ( uhv ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gluing of the samples to the holders and the attachment of top posts was performed in a dry ar glove box . </S>",
    "<S> samples were carefully aligned such that the long axis of the stick - like samples was parallel with the detector , enabling cuts in @xmath13 ( dispersion parallel to the crystal @xmath4-axis ) to be obtained . in this geometry , varying either polar rotation of the sample or the incident photon energy manipulates the wavevector component @xmath14 in the @xmath15-plane of the crystal , although absolute determination of the in - plane wavevector is difficult . </S>",
    "<S> data are obtained with an incident photon energy of @xmath16  ev , with linear polarization either along the crystal @xmath4-axis (  lv \" ) or orthogonal across (  lh \" ) . the experimental energy resolution was set to 23 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi level was obtained from reference measurements on polycrystalline gold . </S>",
    "<S> density functional theory ( dft ) calculations were performed in wien2k  @xcite using the experimental crystal structure @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) , we show the crystal structure of k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 projected in the ( a , b ) plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cr@xmath1as@xmath1 chains extend along the @xmath4 axis are separated by k@xmath17 guest ions in two inequivalent positions . </S>",
    "<S> thus the electronic structure is expected to be dominated by q1d dispersions arising mainly from cr @xmath6 orbitals , which combine into molecular orbitals on the triangular cr plaquettes  @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) we present the shallow core level spectrum of k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the k @xmath18 core levels around 18  ev display a multi - peak structure , core level and the dft calculation is an artifact related to the the often problematic calculation of shallow core levels in dft ] reflecting the inequivalent k sites  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a shallow bump around 11 ev binding energy matches well with the as @xmath19 levels in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the brightest feature in the spectrum from 4  ev up to the fermi level consists of the cr @xmath6 valence bands . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c ) shows the dispersions of these bands along @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed periodicity along @xmath13 matches with the expected brillouin zone , and some dispersions can be associated with particular bands in the dft calculations . </S>",
    "<S> thus we are confident that our measurements are representative of the bulk band dispersions derived from various subshells of the cr  @xmath6-band and that the sample is a single crystal . due to photoemission matrix element effects </S>",
    "<S> , the intensity of dispersions depends strongly on the light polarization . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the intense and highly dispersive band in the left panel of fig </S>",
    "<S> .  [ fig1]c ) ( lh polarization ) is suppressed in lv polarization ( right panel ) , whereas the q1d bands extending up to the fermi level are primarily observed in lv polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we note that these spectra were taken from a freshly cleaved sample ; over a relatively short timescale of a few hours in good uhv the cr @xmath6 bands lose intensity and the detail in the k core level structure is lost as the surface degrades ( see supplemental material , sm for further scaling plots and analysis , details of the normalisation procedure , and a sample comparison . ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there is a good agreement between the dft calculation and the experimental bandwidth of the cr @xmath6 bands , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b , c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a somewhat surprising observation given that k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 has previously been suggested as a strongly correlated electron system due to the anomalously large sommerfeld coefficient @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> metallic systems with strong correlations usually manifest in arpes with renormalized quasiparticle bands which become sharp at the fermi level , and the overall bandwidth can appear compressed compared to dft calculations . </S>",
    "<S> however here the observed cr @xmath6 dispersions generally have a similar bandwidth to the calculations , and fermi velocities are also similar as shown in table  [ tab1 ] , thus only minor or no renormalization effects are found .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]d ) we present the fermi surface map of k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this map is constructed by integrating the spectral weight to a much deeper binding energy of 50  mev than would routinely be used in arpes analysis ; this is necessary since the measured spectral weight disappears as the fermi level is approached , as will be discussed later . </S>",
    "<S> the dft calculations shown in fig .  [ fig1]e , f ) predict the existence of two pairs of q1d bands ( @xmath20,@xmath21 ) and a q3d band ( @xmath22 ) ; due to the absence of inversion symmetry in the crystal structure @xcite the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling in the calculation splits these bands further . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , the fermi surface is found to include only two 1d bands , with no indication of any 3d fermi surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> any spin - orbit induced splitting is not resolved .    </S>",
    "<S> .dispersion parameters of the q1d bands @xmath20 and @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath23 is estimated from fits to dft dispersion over the same range as the experimental data for direct comparison . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we present a detailed analysis of cut a measured in lv polarization which includes the pair of bands which approach the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> band positions are extracted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]d ) by constrained fits of pairs of lorentzian lineshapes . </S>",
    "<S> both band dispersions are found to be near linear over this energy range , and the derived fermi wavevectors and velocities are summarized in table [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the most notable feature of this spectrum is that the spectral weight decreases gradually as the fermi level is approached , which is clear from both from the data slices in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]c ) and the integrated spectral weight in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]e ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]f ) we plot the intensity of the bands as derived from the peak fitting . </S>",
    "<S> both bands show a near linear rise of intensity within @xmath24  ev , after which the outer band intensity saturates to finite values , while the inner band , which dominates in the total intensity , continues to rise .    while a resolution - limited fermi cut - off is typically observed in arpes measurements , as shown by the polycrystalline au reference measurement in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]e ) , the continuous suppression of the single - particle spectral weight is a characteristic of arpes measurements of several different q1d systems  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . one could consider if it may result from order formation , such as a charge density wave leading to a gap opening at @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> however , given that our momentum space surveys show the same spectral weight depletion everywhere in momemtum space , while the material exhibits metallic resistivity without any anomalies except the superconducting transition @xcite , we exclude an ordering - related energy gap at @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between disorder and electron interactions may also deplete the dos near the fermi level @xcite , which has recently been proposed for the interpretation of arpes spectra @xcite . in metallic systems , </S>",
    "<S> the altshuler - aronov theory @xcite predicts that density of states near the fermi level is a non - zero constant plus an anomalous power law contribution ( in 3-d ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however we can dismiss this assignment since our measured dos extrapolates to zero at the fermi level even though the samples are good conductors .    </S>",
    "<S> thus we interpret the missing spectral weight on these q1d dispersions as evidence for the peculiar excitation spectra of a tomonoga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) , where in one dimension the quasi - particle description of excitations breaks down and the highly collective modes allow for low energy excitations only at infinitely small momentum transfer . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a vanishing quasiparticle weight @xmath26  @xcite , and a recovery of spectral weight according to a power law , both as a function of binding energy and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> spectra in agreement with the power law predictions of this model have been observed in varied q1d systems including li@xmath8mo@xmath9o@xmath10 @xcite , carbon nanotubes  @xcite and bi chains grown on insb(001 )  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3]a ) we present the temperature - dependence of integrated intensity corresponding to the data shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the power law behavior of the spectral weight at low temperatures is directly visualized in the double - logarithmic plot of fig .  [ fig3]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> a fit to the data at 10  k yields a nearly linear ( @xmath20=0.974 ) exponent which applies over an energy range of more than an decade . at higher temperatures , the data depart from the simple power law curve below @xmath230  mev , and a more substantial spectral weight remains at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> to model the finite temperature effects , we use a more detailed formula for the intensity ( @xmath32 ) of the spectral function , which has a smooth transition from a low - energy regime involving the fermi - dirac distribution function @xmath33 to a high - energy regime dominated by a power law relation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 ( cited from  @xcite , see also refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for further discussion ) .    </S>",
    "<S> direct fits of this equation ( convolved with experimental resolution ) to data at selected temperatures in the binding energy range @xmath36  mev are presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c ) , showing good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> the fitted exponents @xmath20 are found to be in the range 0.97 - 1.03 for all measured temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) also implies a scaling relation ; on a plot of @xmath37 as a function of temperature - renormalized energy @xmath35 , the various curves as a function of temperature should collapse for the correct choice of @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the plot with @xmath31 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d ) shows excellent scaling behavior ; other choices of @xmath20 away from 1 show progressively worse scaling ( sm ) . the combination of the power law fit , the fitting of eq .  [ eq1 ] and the temperature scaling relation gives good evidence that k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 follows the expected behavior for a tll on both the temperature and energy axes , with a characteristic exponent @xmath381 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature - independent exponent @xmath381 is of a comparable magnitude to exponents observed in other recognized tll systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a decisive proof of the tll state could come from the observation of spin - charge separation . </S>",
    "<S> our data do not provide such evidence , though it may be hidden in the considerably large widths of the features as sharp spinon and chargon excitations are only expected in cases with much lower @xmath39  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that the photoelectron spectroscopy data presented here constitute evidence for tll or closely related physics .    </S>",
    "<S> resistivity measurements along the @xmath4 axis of clean single crystal samples are found to obey a @xmath40 scattering law @xcite , as opposed to the @xmath41 expectation for a fermi liquid . </S>",
    "<S> moreover nmr measurements of k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 found an unusual temperature - dependence of the spin relaxation rate , inconsistent with the korringa law expectation of a fermi liquid but reminiscent of other tll systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while spin fluctuations could still be relevant to both these discussions , deviation from fermi liquid behavior is certainly expected in the context of these arpes results which show an absence of low - energy quasiparticle excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the arpes results also demand a different explanation of the anomalously large sommerfeld coefficient @xcite , other than the picture of quasiparticles renormalized by electron - electron ( or electron - phonon @xcite ) interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that stm studies would show a similar power law behavior to our observations @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our arpes data shows that the tll persists down to 10  k , near the superconducting @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the best starting point for understanding superconductivity may be with tlls hosted by 1-d cr@xmath1as@xmath1 stacks @xcite and only weakly coupled by the k guest ions , rather than with quasiparticles occupying 3-d fermi surfaces @xcite . in q1d superconductors the guest ion type and disorder are crucial for controlling superconductivity , as exemplified in the m@xmath0mo@xmath9se@xmath9 family with guest ion m@xmath42tl , in , na , k , rb @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further arpes and stm studies of the a@xmath43cr@xmath1as@xmath1 family , changing the guest ions to rb@xmath0 , cs@xmath0 , k @xcite , could illuminate its superconducting state .    in conclusion , we have presented an arpes study of single crystals of k@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we find a fermi surface containing two hole - like q1d fermi surface sheets with linear dispersions . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral weight of the q1d bands decreases according to an approximately linear power law over a @xmath2200 mev energy scale up to the fermi level , and obeys a universal temperature scaling . </S>",
    "<S> this is interpreted as a signature of tll behavior . </S>",
    "<S> these results give a new perspective on the rich physics in the q1d a@xmath0cr@xmath1as@xmath1 superconductor family . </S>"
