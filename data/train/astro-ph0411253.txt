    "the mounting evidences suggest that the universe is expanding with acceleration @xcite .",
    "this reveals that the universe is dominated by dark energy with negative pressure , whose energy density fraction is about 2/3 at present .",
    "the nature and origin of dark energy is still mysterious , leaving theoretic physicts searching for novel answers .",
    "althoug a cosmological constant may be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe and be consistent with current observational data , the extremely smallness of the value of the cosmological constant brings a big challenge to us .",
    "it is also possible that the mechanism at work is dynamical .",
    "a dynnamical candidate to provide dark energy may be supplied by a slowly rolling scalar field , widely referred as `` quintessence field '' @xcite .",
    "there are also models of a scalar field with non - canonical kinetic term , known as `` k - essence '' @xcite or `` tachyonic '' models @xcite .",
    "other alternative dark energy models include the holographic dark energy model @xcite and the extra - dimensional motivated models @xcite .    among the cosmological community ,",
    "the consensus about our universe is the so called `` concondance model '' : 95% percent of the universe is composed of dark components .",
    "recently the chaplygin gas model with exotic equation of state @xmath5 was proposed to explain both dark enrgy and dark matter @xcite .",
    "the chaplygin gas model was later generalzied to the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) model with equation of state @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the novel feature of this model is that it unifies dark energy and dark matter in one model .",
    "sandvik and coauthors claimed that the matter power spectrum essentially ruled the gcg model out @xcite .",
    "however , their analysis does not include the effect of the baryons .",
    "bea and collabrators showed that it is important to include baryons in the study of large scale structure and the conclusion changed when baryons were included @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the results in @xcite was based on linear theory of perurbations and neglected any non - linear effects .",
    "the gcg model has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the gcg model was also studied in the framework of modified friedman equation in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider both dust like matter and gcg as the source .",
    "the dust like matter may be just baryons or a portion of dark matter .",
    "unlike other studies , we allow the parameter @xmath7 to be less than @xmath8 and the parameter @xmath9 to be in the region @xmath10 in addition to the usual region @xmath11 .",
    "some physically reasonable conditions are then applied to the model to constrain the parameters .",
    "therefore , the model considered here is more general in addition to be physical .",
    "in a homogeneous and isotropic universe , the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) space - time metric is @xmath12.\\ ] ] for a null geodesic , we have @xmath13 where @xmath14 with both an ordinary pressureless dust matter and gcg as sources , the friedmann equations read @xmath15 where the hubble parameter @xmath16 , dot means derivative with respect to time , @xmath17 is the matter energy density , a subscript 0 means the value of the variable at present time . by using the gcg equation of state @xmath6",
    ", we get the solution to eq .",
    "( [ cos2 ] ) as @xmath18^{1/(1+\\alpha)}.\\ ] ] because @xmath19 , so @xmath20 .",
    "substitute this expression into eq .",
    "( [ eqrhoch ] ) , we get @xmath21 . therefore , eq . ( [ eqrhoch ] ) can be expressed in terms of @xmath22 and @xmath23 as @xmath24^{1/(1+\\alpha)}.\\ ] ] it is obvious that the generalized chaplygin gas behaves like the cosmological constant when @xmath25 and it behaves like the dust matter when @xmath26 . at early times , i.e. , the cosmological radius @xmath27 is small , @xmath28 , which corresponds to a dust like dominated universe . at late times , i.e. , the cosmological radius @xmath27 is large , @xmath29 , which corresponds to a cosmological constant like dominated universe .",
    "therefore the generalized chaplygin gas interpolates between a dust dominated phase in the past and a de - sitter phase at late times .",
    "this distinct feature makes the model an intriguing candidate for the unification of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "the gcg equation of state can be derived from the generalized born - infeld action @xcite @xmath30^{\\alpha/(1+\\alpha)},\\ ] ] where @xmath31 . from the above lagrangian",
    ", we can easily get @xmath32 .",
    "if we take gcg as a quintessence field , i.e. , if we take @xmath33 , then if gcg is the only source in a spatially flat universe , the potential for gcg is @xmath34 , \\end{split}\\ ] ] here we set @xmath35 .    by using eq .",
    "( [ eqrhoch1 ] ) , we get @xmath36^{-\\alpha/(1+\\alpha)}.\\ ] ] if @xmath37 , then to the first order of expansion , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are @xmath40,\\ ] ] @xmath41.\\ ] ] from the above expressions , we see a mixture of a cosmological constant with a type of dark energy described by a constant equation of state parameter @xmath9 .",
    "so the physical meaning of @xmath9 may be given in this sense .",
    "follow chiba and nakamura @xcite , we require the following physically reasonable conditions : ( 1 ) the current total energy density is non - negative ; ( 2 ) the total energy density is not increasing ; ( 3 ) the present sound speed @xmath42 of the system satisfies @xmath43 because of causality and local stability .",
    "the first condition gives @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "the second condition tells us that @xmath46 , where the deceleration parameter @xmath47 .",
    "the second condition is equivalent to the requirement that the effective equation of state for the total source @xmath48 .",
    "the third condition gives @xmath49 , where the jerk parameter @xmath50 .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath51 and the jerk parameter @xmath52 are similar to the state finder parameters used in @xcite .    for the generalized chaplygin gas model , we get @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 . by using the above eqs .",
    "( [ eqj0 ] ) and ( [ eqq0 ] ) , we get the following constraints @xmath57 @xmath58 @xmath59 furthermore , we require that @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "to get accelerated expansion , we also require that @xmath62 .",
    "therefore , we have one additional constraint @xmath63 in the literature , the parameters are usually constrained to be @xmath33 and @xmath64 .",
    "some authors also considered the possibility of @xmath65 . from eqs .",
    "( [ cond1]-[cond4 ] ) , we see that it is possible to get @xmath66 if @xmath67 . in this paper , we consider the parameter space to be : @xmath68 $ ] , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 $ ] .",
    "in addition to the constraints ( [ cond1]-[cond4 ] ) on the parameters , we also require that the energy density of gcg given in eq .",
    "( [ eqrhoch1 ] ) is not negative .",
    "combining eqs .",
    "( [ cos1 ] ) , ( [ cos2 ] ) and ( [ eqrhoch1 ] ) , we get the transition redshift @xmath72 when the expansion of the universe underwent the transition from deceleration to acceleration @xmath73^{\\alpha/(1+\\alpha)}\\\\ = -2w_{c0}(1+z_t)^{-3}-(1+w_{c0})(1+z_t)^{3\\alpha}.\\end{split}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we use the 157 gold sample supernova ia ( sn ia ) data compiled in @xcite to fit the model .",
    "the parameters in the model are determined by minimizing @xmath74 ^ 2\\over \\sigma^2_i},\\ ] ] where the extinction - corrected distance moduli @xmath75 , the redshift @xmath76 , the luminosity distance is @xmath77\\\\ = \\frac{1+z}{h_0\\sqrt{|\\omega_k| } } { \\rm sinn}\\left[\\sqrt{|\\omega_k|}\\int_0^z \\frac{dz'}{e(z')}\\right],\\end{split}\\ ] ] the dimensionless hubble parameter @xmath78 , @xmath79 is defined as @xmath80\\{@xmath81 , @xmath82 } if @xmath83\\{@xmath84 , @xmath8 } respectively , and @xmath85 is the total uncertainty in the observation .",
    "the nuisance parameter @xmath86 is marginalized over with a flat prior assumption .",
    "since @xmath86 appears linearly in the form of @xmath87 in @xmath88 , so the marginalization by integrating @xmath89 over all possible values of @xmath86 is equivalent to finding the value of @xmath86 which minimizes @xmath88 if we also include the suitable integration constant .",
    "because we assume a flat prior on @xmath86 , therefore alternatively we marginalize @xmath86 by minimizing @xmath90 $ ] over @xmath91 , where @xmath92 . to get the marginalized likelihood of a parameter , we marginalize all other parameters by integrating the probability distribution @xmath89 over all possible values of the other parameters .",
    "we first consider the special case @xmath25 , i.e. , the lcdm ( lambda cold dark matter ) model .",
    "the best fit to the riess gold data is @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "the akaike information criterion ( aic ) is @xmath95 and the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) is @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "next we consider the spatially flat case @xmath97 , the best global fit gives that @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 with @xmath101 .",
    "due to the constraints ( [ cond1]-[cond4 ] ) , it is difficult to find contours for the parameters .",
    "the aic is @xmath102 and the bic is @xmath103 . for @xmath104 and @xmath67 , we get the local best fit : @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 with @xmath108 .",
    "the aic is @xmath109 and the bic is @xmath110 .",
    "the probability distributions of @xmath111 , @xmath22 and @xmath9 are shown in figs .",
    "[ wprob]-[aprob ] .",
    "it is obvious that the distributions have bimodal characteristics .",
    "therefore the models @xmath112 and @xmath113 fit the supernova data almost equally well .",
    "the best fit of the full model gives that @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 with @xmath118 .",
    "apparently , the full gcg model with curvature term fits worse than the spatially flat gcg model and the full model tends to be curved lcdm model .",
    "if we think that the dust like matter source consists baryons only , then we can add a prior @xmath119 @xcite on the gcg model . in this case , for a spatially flat universe , the best fit parameters are @xmath1 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 with @xmath122 . substituting the best fit parameters into eq .",
    "( [ eqzt ] ) , we find the transition redshift is @xmath4 .",
    "the above results are summarized in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "therefore , the current sn ia data does not favor gcg model over lcdm model .",
    "furthermore , more parameters fail to give better fit .",
    ".the comparison between different models .",
    "gcg1 refers to the globally best fit spatially flat gcg model , gcg2 refers to the locally best fit spatially flat gcg model and gcg3 refers to the spatially flat gcg model with the assumption that the dust like matter source is only baryons .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for the spatially flat lcdm model , the best fit result is @xmath123 with @xmath124 . due to the sparse of the data ,",
    "the result is not as good as that from sn ia . for the spatially flat gcg model ,",
    "the best fit results are : @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "again , the data does not favor gcg model over lcdm model .",
    "in this paper , we studied the gcg model which provides a phenomenological mechanism of unifying dark matter and dark energy .",
    "we explored a larger parameter space for the gcg model . instead of studying the usual parameter range @xmath128 , we extended the parameter space to be @xmath0 with some physical constraints on the parameters .",
    "we found that the parameters had bimodal distributions in general .",
    "the constraints from type ia sn data and the age data of clusters do not favor the gcg model over the simplest lcdm model from the standards of the akaike information criterion and the bayesian information criterion .",
    "therefore , the current observations are consistent with both the gcg model and the lcdm model .",
    "moreover , the flat model fits the observational data better .",
    "the only benefit of the gcg model is that it may provide a phenomenological mechanism of unifying dark matter and dark energy .",
