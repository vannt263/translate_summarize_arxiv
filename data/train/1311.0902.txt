    "( fiwi ) access networks , also referred to as wireless - optical broadband access networks ( wobans ) , combine the reliability , robustness , and high capacity of optical fiber networks and the flexibility , ubiquity , and cost savings of wireless networks  @xcite . to deliver peak data",
    "rates up to 200 mb / s per user and realize the vision of complete fixed - mobile convergence , it is crucial to replace today s legacy wireline and microwave backhaul technologies with integrated fiwi broadband access networks  @xcite .",
    "significant progress has been made on the design of advanced fiwi network architectures as well as access techniques and routing protocols / algorithms over the last few years  @xcite . among others ,",
    "the beneficial impact of advanced hierarchical frame aggregation techniques on the end - to - end throughput - delay performance of an integrated ethernet passive optical network ( epon)/wireless mesh network ( wmn)-based fiwi network was demonstrated by means of simulation and experiment for voice , video , and data traffic  @xcite .",
    "a linear programming based routing algorithm was proposed in  @xcite with the objective of maximizing the throughput of a fiwi network based on a cascaded epon and single - radio single - channel wmn .",
    "extensive simulations were conducted to study the throughput gain in fiwi networks under peer - to - peer traffic among wireless mesh clients and compare the achievable throughput gain with conventional wmns without any optical backhaul .",
    "the presented simulation results show that fiwi and conventional wmn networks achieve the same throughput when all traffic is destined to the internet , i.e. , no peer - to - peer traffic , since the interference in the wireless front - end is the major bandwidth bottleneck .",
    "however , with increasing peer - to - peer traffic the interferences in the wireless mesh front - end increase and the throughput of wmns decreases significantly , as opposed to their fiwi counterpart whose network throughput decreases to a much lesser extent for increasing peer - to - peer traffic .    the design of routing algorithms for the wireless front - end only or for both the wireless and optical domains of fiwi access networks has received a great deal of attention , resulting in a large number of wireless , integrated optical - wireless , multipath , and energy - aware routing algorithms .",
    "important examples of wireless routing algorithms for fiwi access networks are the so - called delay - aware routing algorithm ( dara )  @xcite , delay - differentiated routing algorithm ( ddra )  @xcite , capacity and delay aware routing ( cadar )  @xcite , and risk - and - delay aware routing ( radar ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "recently proposed integrated routing algorithms for path computation across the optical - wireless interface include the so - called availability - aware routing  @xcite , multipath routing  @xcite , and energy - aware routing algorithms  @xcite .",
    "most of these previous studies formulated routing in fiwi access networks as an optimization problem and obtained results mainly by means of simulation .    in this paper , we present to the best of our knowledge the first analytical framework that allows to evaluate the capacity and delay performance of a wide range of fiwi network routing algorithms and provides important design guidelines for novel fiwi network routing algorithms that leverage the different unique characteristics of disparate optical fiber and wireless technologies .",
    "although a few fiwi architectural studies exist on the integration of epon with long - term evolution ( lte ) ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) or worldwide interoperability for microwave access ( wimax ) wireless front - end networks ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , the vast majority of studies , including but not limited to those mentioned in the above paragraph , considered fiwi access networks consisting of a conventional ieee 802.3ah epon fiber backhaul network and an ieee 802.11b / g wireless local area network ( wlan)-based wireless mesh front - end network  @xcite .",
    "our framework encompasses not only legacy epon and wlan networks , but also emerging next - generation optical and wireless technologies , such as long - reach and multi - stage 10 + gb / s time and/or wavelength division multiplexing ( tdm / wdm ) pons as well as gigabit - class very high throughput ( vht ) wlan .",
    "our contributions are threefold .",
    "first , we develop a unified analytical framework that comprehensively accounts for both optical and wireless broadband access networking technologies .",
    "we note that recent studies focused either on tdm / wdm pons only , e.g. ,  @xcite , or on wlans only , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "however , there is a need for a comprehensive analytical framework that gives insights into the performance of bimodal fiwi access networks built from disparate yet complementary optical and wireless technologies . toward this end ,",
    "our framework is flexibly designed such that it not only takes the capacity mismatch and bit error rate differences between optical and wireless networks into account , but also includes possible fiber cuts of optical ( wired ) infrastructures .",
    "second , our analysis emphasizes future and emerging next - generation pon and wlan technologies , as opposed to many previous studies that assumed state - of - the - art solutions , e.g. , conventional ieee 802.11a wlan without frame aggregation  @xcite .",
    "our analytical approach in part builds on previous studies and includes significant original analysis components to achieve accurate throughput - delay modeling and cover the scope of fiwi networks .",
    "specifically , we build on analytical models of the distributed coordination function in wlans , e.g. ,  @xcite , and wlan frame aggregation , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "we develop an accurate delay model for multihop wireless front - ends under nonsaturated and stable conditions for traffic loads from both optical and wireless network nodes , as detailed in section  [ sec : wireless ] .",
    "third , we verify our analysis by means of simulations and present extensive numerical results to shed some light on the interplay between different next - generation optical and wireless access networking technologies and configurations for a variety of traffic scenarios .",
    "we propose an _ optimized fiwi routing algorithm ( ofra ) _ based on our developed analytical framework .",
    "the obtained results show that ofra outperforms previously proposed routing algorithms , such as dara  @xcite , cadar  @xcite , and radar  @xcite .",
    "they also illustrate that it is key to carefully select appropriate paths across the fiber backhaul in order to minimize link traffic intensities and thus help stabilize the entire fiwi access network .    to our best knowledge",
    ", the presented unified analytical framework is the first to allow capacity and delay evaluations of a wide range of fiwi network routing algorithms , both previously proposed and new ones .",
    "our analytical framework covers not only legacy epon and wlan , but also next - generation high - speed long - reach wdm pon and emerging gigabit - class vht wlan technologies .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : related ] , we discuss related work and recent progress on fiwi access networks . section  [ sec : fiwi ] describes fiwi access networks based on next - generation pon and gigabit - class wlan technologies in greater detail .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] outlines our network model as well as traffic and routing assumptions .",
    "the capacity and delay of the constituent fiber backhaul and wireless front - end networks are analyzed in sections  [ sec : fiber ] and  [ sec : wireless ] , respectively , while the stability and end - to - end delay of the entire fiwi access network are evaluated in section  [ sec : end - to - end ] .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] presents numerical and verifying simulation results .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "the recent survey of hybrid optical - wireless access networks  @xcite explains the key underlying photonic and wireless access technologies and describes important fiwi access network architectures .",
    "energy - efficient fiwi network architectures as well as energy - efficient medium access control ( mac ) and routing protocols were reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "recent efforts on energy - efficient routing in fiwi access networks focused on routing algorithms for cloud - integrated fiwi networks that offload the wireless mesh front - end and the optical - wireless gateways by placing cloud components , such as storage and servers , closer to mobile end - users , while at the same time maintaining low average packet delays  @xcite .",
    "a delay - based admission control scheme for providing guaranteed quality - of - service ( qos ) in fiwi networks that deploy epon as backhaul for connecting multiple wimax base stations was studied in  @xcite .",
    "a promising approach to increase throughput , decrease delay , and achieve better load balancing and resilience is the use of multipath routing schemes in the wireless mesh front - end of fiwi networks .",
    "however , due to different delays along multiple paths , packets may arrive at the destination out of order , which deteriorates the performance of the transmission control protocol ( tcp ) .",
    "a centralized scheduling algorithm at the optical line terminal ( olt ) of an epon that resequences the in - transit packets of each flow to ensure in - order packet arrivals at the corresponding destination was examined in  @xcite .",
    "in addition ,  @xcite studied a dynamic bandwidth allocation ( dba ) algorithm that prioritizes flows that may trigger tcp s fast retransmit and fast recovery , thereby further improving tcp performance .",
    "given the increasing traffic amounts on fiwi networks , their survivability has become increasingly important  @xcite .",
    "cost - effective protection schemes against link and node failures in the optical part of fiwi networks have been proposed and optimized in  @xcite .",
    "the survivability of fiwi networks based on multi - stage pons , taking not only partial optical protection but also protection through a wireless mesh network into account , was probabilistically analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "deployment of both back - up fibers and radios was examined in  @xcite .",
    "recent research efforts have focused on the integration of performance - enhancing network coding techniques to increase the throughput and decrease the delay of fiwi access networks for unicast and multicast traffic  @xcite .",
    "most previous fiwi access network studies considered a cascaded architecture consisting of a single - stage pon and a multihop wmn , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . typically , the pon is a conventional ieee 802.3ah compliant wavelength - broadcasting tdm epon based on a wavelength splitter / combiner at the remote node ( rn ) , using one time - shared wavelength channel for upstream ( onus to olt ) transmissions and another time - shared wavelength channel for downstream ( olt to onus ) transmissions , both operating at a data rate of 1  gb / s .",
    "a subset of onus may be located at the premises of residential or business subscribers , whereby each onu provides fiber - to - the - home / business ( ftth / b ) services to a single or multiple attached wired subscribers .",
    "some onus have a mesh portal point ( mpp ) to interface with the wmn .",
    "the wmn consists of mesh access points ( maps ) that provide wireless fiwi network access to stations ( stas ) .",
    "mesh points ( mps ) relay the traffic between mpps and maps through wireless transmissions .",
    "most previous fiwi studies assumed a wmn based on ieee 802.11a / b / g wlan technologies , offering a maximum raw data rate of 54 mb / s at the physical layer .",
    "future fiwi access networks will leverage next - generation pon and wlan technologies to meet the ever increasing bandwidth requirements . a variety of next - generation pon technologies",
    "are currently investigated to enable short - term evolutionary and long - term revolutionary upgrades of coexistent gigabit - class tdm pons  @xcite .",
    "promising solutions for pon evolution toward higher bandwidth per user are ( @xmath0 ) data rate upgrades to 10 gb / s and higher , and ( @xmath1 ) multi - wavelength channel migration toward wavelength - routing or wavelength - broadcasting wdm pons with or without cascaded tdm pons  @xcite .",
    "similarly , to alleviate the bandwidth bottleneck of the wireless mesh front - end , future fiwi networks are expected to be based on next - generation ieee 802.11n wlans , which offer data rates of 100 mb / s or higher at the mac service access point , as well as emerging ieee 802.11ac vht wlan technologies that achieve raw data rates up to 6900 mb / s .          as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , current tdm pons may evolve into next - generation single- or multi - stage pons of extended reach by exploiting high - speed tdm and/or multichannel wdm technologies and replacing the splitter / combiner at the rn with a wavelength multiplexer / demultiplexer , giving rise to the following three types of next - generation pons :      fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2](a ) depicts a high - speed tdm pon , which maintains the network architecture of conventional tdm pons except that both the time - shared upstream wavelength channel @xmath2 and downstream wavelength channel @xmath3 and attached olt and tdm onus operate at data rates of 10 gb / s or higher  @xcite .",
    "a wavelength - broadcasting wdm pon has a splitter / combiner at the rn and deploys multiple wavelength channels @xmath4 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) .",
    "each of these @xmath5 wavelength channels is broadcast to all connected wdm onus and is used for bidirectional transmission .",
    "each wdm onu selects a wavelength with a tunable bandpass filter ( e.g. , fiber bragg grating ) and reuses the downstream modulated signal coming from the olt for upstream data transmission by means of remodulation techniques , e.g. , fsk for downstream and ook for upstream  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c ) shows a wavelength - routing wdm pon , where the conventional splitter / combiner at the rn is replaced with a wavelength multiplexer / demultiplexer , e.g. , arrayed - waveguide grating ( awg ) , such that each of the @xmath5 wavelength channels on the common feeder fiber is routed to a different distribution fiber . a given wavelength channel may be dedicated to a single onu ( e.g. , business subscriber ) or be time shared by multiple onus ( e.g. , residential subscribers ) . in the latter case , the distribution fibers contain one or more additional stages , whereby each stage consists of a wavelength - broadcasting splitter / combiner and each wavelength channel serves a different sector , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c ) . note that due to the wavelength - routing characteristics of the wavelength multiplexer / demultiplexer , onus can be made colorless ( i.e. , wavelength - independent ) by using , for example , low - cost reflective semiconductor optical amplifiers ( rsoas ) that are suitable for bidirectional transmission via remodulation  @xcite .",
    "wavelength - routing multi - stage wdm pons enable next - generation pons with an extended optical range of up to 100 km , thus giving rise to _ long - reach wdm pons _ at the expense of additional in - line optical amplifiers .",
    "long - reach wdm pons promise major cost savings by consolidating optical access and metropolitan area networks  @xcite .",
    "ieee 802.11n specifies a number of phy and mac enhancements for next - generation wlans .",
    "applying orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) and multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) antennas in the phy layer of ieee 802.11n provides various capabilities , such as antenna diversity ( selection ) and spatial multiplexing .",
    "using multiple antennas also provides multipath capability and increases both throughput and transmission range .",
    "the enhanced phy layer applies two adaptive coding schemes : space time block coding ( stbc ) and low density parity check coding ( ldpc ) .",
    "ieee 802.11n wlans are able to co - exist with ieee 802.11 legacy wlans , though in greenfield deployments it is possible to increase the channel bandwidth from 20 mhz to 40 mhz via channel bonding , resulting in significantly increased raw data rates of up to 600 mb / s at the phy layer .",

    "both a - msdu and a - mpdu require only a single phy preamble and phy header . in a - msdu , the psdu includes a single mac header and frame check sequence ( fcs ) , as opposed to a - mpdu where each mpdu contains its own mac header and fcs .",
    "a - mpdu and a - msdu can be used separately or jointly .",

    "for a wavelength - routing wdm pon operating at a wavelength channel data rate of 1 gb / s , we observe from fig .",
    "[ fig : result6 ] that vht wlan roughly triples the maximum mean aggregate throughput and clearly outperforms 600 mb / s 802.11n wlan in terms of both throughput and delay .",
    "furthermore , the figure shows that replacing the 1 gb / s wavelength - routing wdm pon with its high - speed 10  gb / s counterpart ( compliant with the ieee 802.3av 10g - epon standard ) does not yield a higher maximum aggregate throughput , but it does lower the mean delay especially at medium traffic loads before wireless links at the optical - wireless interfaces get increasingly congested at higher traffic loads .",
    "a variety of routing algorithms have recently been proposed for integrated fiwi access networks based on complementary epon and wlan - mesh networks . in this article",
    ", we presented the first analytical framework to quantify the performance of fiwi network routing algorithms , validate previous simulation studies , and provide insightful guidelines for the design of novel integrated optical - wireless routing algorithms for future fiwi access networks leveraging next - generation pons , notably long - reach 10 + gb / s tdm / wdm pons , and emerging gigabit - class wlan technologies .",
    "our analytical framework is very flexible and can be applied to any existing or new optical - wireless routing algorithm .",
    "furthermore , it takes the different characteristics of disparate optical and wireless networking technologies into account . beside their capacity mismatch and bit error rate differences",
    ", the framework also incorporates arbitrary frame size distributions , traffic matrices , optical / wireless propagation delays , data rates , and fiber cuts .",
    "we investigated the performance of minimum hop , minimum interference ( wireless hop ) , minimum delay , and our proposed ofra routing algorithms .",
    "the obtained results showed that ofra yields the highest maximum aggregate throughput for both conventional and long - reach wavelength - routing wdm pons under balanced and unbalanced traffic loads .",
    "for a higher loaded fiber backhaul , however , ofra gives priority to lightly loaded wireless links , leading to an increased mean delay at small to medium wireless traffic loads .",
    "we also observed that using vht wlan helps increase the maximum mean aggregate throughput significantly , while high - speed 10 gb / s wdm pon helps lower the mean delay especially at medium traffic loads .",
    "there are several important directions for future research .",
    "one direction is to examine mechanisms for providing qulity of service or supporting specific traffic types , see e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "further detailed study of the impact of different dynamic bandwidth allocation approaches for long - reach pons , e.g. ,  @xcite , and their effectiveness in integrated fiwi networks is of interest .",
    "yet another direction is the examine the internetworking of fiwi networks with metropolitan area networks  @xcite .",
