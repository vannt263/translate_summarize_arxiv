    "in two dimensional disorder conductors , the diffusive transport induces quantum corrections to the semi - classical drude conductance at low temperature , which can be expressed as the following : @xmath26 the first term @xmath27 is the semi - classical drude conductance , which is determined by the elastic scattering due to the disorder and is a constant as a function of temperature .",
    "the second term @xmath28 is the correction due to the single particle quantum interference effect such as weak localization or weak anti - localization .",
    "the weak localization ( wl ) is a result of the constructive interference between a pair of time reversal electron waves that travel back to the origin , which induces a negative correction to the conductance when the coherence length is long compared to the elastic mean free path . on",
    "the contrary , in the presence of strong spin - orbit coupling , a pair of time reversal waves interfere destructively and leads to weak anti - localization ( wal ) , which is a positive correction to the conductance .",
    "these two effects have a @xmath14 dependence and are mutually exclusive .",
    "the last term @xmath29 is the correction due to the disorder enhance electron - electron interaction ( eei ) .",
    "the diffusive transport reduces the screening effect from electrons and suppresses the density of states at the fermi level , which induces a negatvie correction to conductance .",
    "since it is due to the presence of electron electron interaction , it could coexist with either wl or wal effect and also has a @xmath14 dependence .",
    "application of magnetic fields suppresses the single particle interference effect , because it creates a phase difference between the pair of time reversal electron waves .",
    "since the single particle particle interference is due to the orbital motion within the two dimensional plane , the magnetoresistance ( mr ) induced by which is expected to be highly anisotropic .",
    "as shown in the main text , the mr of the thin film is highly isotropic , which rules out the single particle contribution to the quantum correction of conductance , i.e. @xmath28 = 0 .",
    "therefore the @xmath14 upturn of the resistance of the film is solely resulted from eei .",
    "the absence of single particle interference could be resulted from a strong spin - flip scattering due to magnetic impurities or fluctuations of magnetic ordering .",
    "however the eei could be enhanced by spin flip scattering , as we will show below .",
    "the temperature dependence of the quantum correction to conductance due to disorder enhanced electron electron interaction can be expressed as the following@xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the electron screen factor with a range of @xmath32 . in the case of strong spin - orbit coupling or spin - flip scattering , the screen factor @xmath33 or equivalently @xmath34 . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , fitting the zero field conductance of the 25 nm thick  film we obtained a value of 1.17 for @xmath35 .",
    "this is consistent with presence of strong spin - flip scattering as we inferred from the absence of single particle interference effect .",
    "the slightly over than 1 value of @xmath35 might be due to the uncertainty of measuring the geometric factor of the conductance of the film .",
    ", which is typically 10 to 20% at maximum .    in general , the eei also has a magnetic field dependence due to the zeeman spin splitting , which has the following expression : @xmath36 where g is the lande g factor and @xmath37 is a non - analytic function that can be computed numerically .",
    "the prefactor @xmath31 is the same electron screen factor extracted from the zero field temperature dependence .",
    "as we already know @xmath33 for the  film , therefore the eei has no contribution to mr .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the single crystal shows the identical linear mr as the thin film , despite the fact that it has no @xmath14 upturn in the zero field resistance ."

    "<S> based on these experimental findings , a recent theoretical calculation has argued that  could be described by the metallic antiferromagnetic phase in the global phase diagram of the pyrochlore iridates@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the metallic antiferromagnetic phase has the same electronic structure of the weyl semi - metal phase . </S>",
