    "solar neutrinos were first detected already three decades ago in the homestake experiment @xcite and from the very beginning it was pointed out the puzzling issue of the deficit in the observed rate as compared to the theoretical expectation based on the standard solar model @xcite with the implicit assumption that neutrinos created in the solar interior reach the earth unchanged , i.e. they are massless and have only standard properties and interactions .",
    "this discrepancy led to a change in the original goal of using solar neutrinos to probe the properties of the solar interior towards the study of the properties of the neutrino itself and it triggered an intense activity both theoretical as well as experimental , with new measurements being proposed in order to address the origin of the deficit .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "enormous progress has been done in the improvement of solar modeling and calculation of nuclear cross sections .",
    "for example , helioseismological observations have now established that diffusion is occurring and by now most solar models incorporate the effects of helium and heavy element diffusion  @xcite . > from the experimental point of view the situation is now much richer .",
    "four additional experiments to the original chlorine experiment at homestake @xcite have also detected solar neutrinos : the radiochemical gallium experiments on @xmath4 neutrinos , gallex @xcite and sage  @xcite , and the water cerenkov detectors kamiokande  @xcite and super ",
    "kamiokande @xcite .",
    "the latter have been able not only to confirm the original detection of solar neutrinos at lower rates than predicted by standard solar models , but also to demonstrate directly that the neutrinos come from the sun by showing that recoil electrons are scattered in the direction along the sun - earth axis .",
    "moreover , they have also provided us with good information on the time dependence of the event rates during the day and night , as well as a measurement of the recoil electron energy spectrum .",
    "after 825 days of operation , super ",
    "kamiokande has also presented preliminary results on the seasonal variation of the neutrino event rates , an issue which will become important in discriminating the msw scenario from the possibility of neutrino oscillations in vacuum  @xcite . at the present stage ,",
    "the quality of the experiments themselves and the robustness of the theory give us confidence that in order to describe the data one must depart from the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics interactions by endowing neutrinos with new properties . in theories beyond the sm ,",
    "neutrinos may naturally have new properties , the most generic of which is the existence of mass .",
    "it is undeniable that the most popular explanation of the solar neutrino anomaly is in terms of neutrino masses and mixing leading to neutrino oscillations either in _ vacuum _",
    "@xcite or via the matter - enhanced _ msw mechanism _",
    "@xcite .    on the other hand , together with the results from the solar neutrino experiments we have two more evidences pointing out towards the existence of neutrino masses and mixing : the atmospheric neutrino data and the lsnd results .",
    "the first one can be summarize in the existence of a long - standing anomaly between the predicted and observed @xmath5 ratio of the atmospheric neutrino fluxes @xcite . in this respect",
    "it has been of crucial relevance the confirmation by the super  kamiokande collaboration @xcite of the atmospheric neutrino zenith - angle - dependent deficit , which strongly indicates towards the existence of @xmath6 conversion .",
    "in addition to the solar and atmospheric neutrino results from underground experiments , there is also the indication for neutrino oscillations in the @xmath7 channel by the lsnd experiment  @xcite .",
    "all these experimental results can be accommodated in a single neutrino oscillation framework only if there are at least three different scales of neutrino mass - squared differences .",
    "the simplest case of three independent mass - squared differences requires the existence of a light sterile neutrino , _",
    "i.e. _ one whose interaction with standard model particles is much weaker than the sm weak interaction , so it does not affect the invisible z decay width , precisely measured at lep @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present an analysis of the neutrino oscillation solutions of the solar neutrino problem in the framework of four  neutrino mixing where a sterile neutrino is added to the three standard ones .",
    "we perform a fit of the full data set corresponding to the 825-day super  kamiokande data sample as well as the data of the chlorine , gallex and sage experiments . in our analysis",
    "we use all measured total event rates and all super  kamiokande data on the zenith angle dependence and the recoil electron energy spectrum .",
    "we consider both transitions via the mikheyev  smirnov ",
    "wolfenstein ( msw ) mechanism as well as oscillations in vacuum ( just - so ) and find the allowed solutions for different values of the additional mixing angles .",
    "our analysis contains as limiting cases the pure @xmath1active and @xmath1sterile neutrino oscillations .",
    "we discuss the maximum allowed values of the additional mixing angles for which the different solutions are allowed .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] we summarize the main expressions for the neutrino oscillation formulas that we use in the analysis of solar neutrino data which take into account matter effects in the case of the msw solution of the solar neutrino problem .",
    "we also present some improvement concerning the calculation of the regeneration of solar @xmath1 s in the earth in appendix  [ append ] .",

    "in this paper we consider the two four - neutrino schemes that can accommodate the results of all neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite : @xmath8 in both these mass spectra there are two pairs of close masses separated by a gap of about 1 ev which gives the mass - squared difference @xmath9 responsible for the short - baseline ( sbl ) oscillations observed in the lsnd experiment ( we use the common notation @xmath10 ) .",
    "we have ordered the masses in such a way that in both schemes @xmath11 produces solar neutrino oscillations and @xmath12 is responsible for atmospheric neutrino oscillations . with this convention",
    ", the data of solar neutrino experiments can be analyzed using the neutrino oscillation formalism presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , that takes into account matter effects . in this section",
    "we present the neutrino oscillation formulas that we use in the analysis of solar neutrino data .",

    "we present some improvement concerning the calculation of the regeneration of solar @xmath1 s in the earth ( see the appendix  [ append ] ) .    in four - neutrino schemes the flavor neutrino fields @xmath13 ( @xmath14 )",

    "let us remind the reader that @xmath6 and @xmath43 can not be distinguished in solar neutrino experiments , because their matter potential and their interaction in the detectors are equal , due only to neutral - current weak interactions .",
    "the active / sterile ratio and solar neutrino oscillations in general do not depend on the mixing angle @xmath37 , that contribute only to the different mixings of @xmath6 and @xmath43 , and depends on the mixing angles @xmath35 @xmath36 only through the combination @xmath44 . indeed , from eq .",

    "if @xmath50 , solar @xmath1 s can transform in the linear combination @xmath47 of active @xmath6 and @xmath43 .",
