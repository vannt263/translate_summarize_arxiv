    "spiral structure in galaxies is a combination of sheared features from star formation and spiral density waves in the gas and stars .",
    "most non - barred galaxies in the field , such as ngc 2841 and ngc 5055 , have short and patchy arms ( `` flocculent '' ) , while most galaxies with bars or nearby companions , such as m81 and m51 , have spiral waves or wavemodes that give them a grand design ( kormendy & norman 1979 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 1982 ; elmegreen , elmegreen & seiden 1989 ) .",
    "flocculent galaxies also have small disk - to - halo mass ratios ( athanassoula , bosma , & papaioannou 1987 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 1990 ; fuchs 2002 ) , which helps to explain why their spiral waves are weak ( mark 1976 ; thornley 1996 ; kuno , et al .",
    "1997 ; elmegreen et al . 1999",
    "; puerari et al . 2000 ) .",
    "star formation in grand design galaxies is often attributed to compression from a density wave ( roberts 1969 ) , although these galaxies have no higher star formation rates per unit gas or area than flocculent galaxies ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1986 ; stark , elmegreen , & chance 1987 ) .",
    "both types also satisfy the kennicutt ( 1998 ) relation between average star formation rate and gas surface density . these observations , along with the similar star formation properties in dwarf irregular galaxies ( hunter & gallagher 1986 ) and the decoupling between b and k - band features in galaxy disks ( block & puerari 1999 ) suggest that small - scale star formation processes are the same everywhere , regardless of the presence or lack of a spiral wave .",
    "this means that if a strong wave is present and a high fraction of the star - forming clouds are formed by the wave , then the star formation processes inside these clouds will be no different than the star formation processes elsewhere",
    ". it also means that if there is no stellar wave , then the interstellar gas will form the same total surface density of clouds by other means ( see review in elmegreen 2002 ) .",
    "the nature of the star formation process itself has been elucidated recently through studies of geometry and kinematics .",
    "fractal - fitting procedures based on star - neighbor distributions , cell counting , and cluster hierarchies ( feitzinger & braunsfurth 1984 ; feitzinger & galinski 1987 ; battinelli , efremov , & magnier 1996 ; elmegreen & salzer 1999 ; heydari - malayeri et al .",
    "2001 ; pietrzynski et al . 2001 ) , unsharp masks ( elmegreen & elmegreen 2001 ) , and auto - correlation functions ( feitzinger & braunsfurth 1984 ; harris & zaritsky 1999 ; zhang , fall , & whitmore 2001 ) show a hierarchical , self - similar type of structure that often extends from the telescope resolution up to a kiloparsec or more . self - similar structure also goes to sub - parsec scales in nearby regions ( testi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "these patterns are apparently present as long as the regions are younger than a crossing time ( elmegreen 2000 ) ; after this , random stellar motions smooth out the geometric structure of stellar birth .",
    "the hierarchical structure for star formation is similar to that in the interstellar gas , which is also fractal over a wide range of scales ( dickman , horvath & margulis 1990 ; scalo 1990 ; falgarone , phillips , & walker 1991 ; elmegreen & falgarone 1996 ; sttzki et al .",
    "1998 ; westpfahl et al . 1999 ; keel & white 2001 ) .",
    "this similarity suggests that young stars follow the gas as they form ; some are triggered in this gas by external stellar pressures and others form spontaneously .",
    "there is also a time and distance correlation for young stars that is similar to that for the gas ( efremov & elmegreen 1998 ) .",
    "this implies that stars initially move along with the gas and that both the star formation event and the cloud lifetime are limited by the transience of local gas flows ( ballesteros - paredes , hartmann , & vzquez - semadeni 1999 ) .",
    "the origin of the kinematic and spatial correlations is probably turbulence ( larson 1981 ; falgarone & phillips 1990 ) . numerical simulations reproduce these features well and also show how stars might form spontaneously in a turbulent medium ( klessen , heitsch , & mac low 2000 ; ossenkopf , klessen , & heitsch 2001 ; klessen 2001 ; padoan et al . 2001a ; padoan & nordlund 2002 ) .",
    "interstellar turbulence can arise from a combination of spiral - forming instabilities driven by the swing - amplifier ( toomre & kalnajs 1991 ; thomasson , donner , & elmegreen 1991 ; de vega , sanchez , & combes 1996 ; fuchs & von linden 1998 ; semelin & combes 2000 ; crosthwaite , turner , & ho 2000 ; bertin & lodato 2001 ; wada & norman 2001 ; wada , meurer , & norman 2002 ; huber & pfenniger 2001a , b , 2002 ; vollmer & beckert 2002 ; chavanis 2002 ) and stellar pressures ( norman & ferrara 1996 ; avila - reese & vzquez - semadeni 2001 ) .",
    "spiral instabilities in the gas pump gravitational binding energy and shear energy into turbulent motions over a wide range of scales .",
    "stellar pressures may generate turbulence only locally ( braun 1999 ; vzquez - semadeni & garca 2001 ) .",
    "magnetic instabilities can also generate turbulence ( asseo et al .",
    "1978 ; sellwood & balbus 1999 ) , but they generally do not produce dense cloudy structures by themselves .    if spiral - forming instabilities drive the turbulence and compression that make star - forming clouds , and if this turbulence also produces correlated structures that eventually show up in young star fields , then flocculent spiral structure in galaxies should have the same geometric properties as local interstellar clouds .",
    "if star formation processes are also independent of stellar spiral waves , then the star - forming parts of a grand design galaxy should have the same intrinsic geometry as flocculent spirals .",
    "this paper measures the fourier transform power spectra of optical light in six galaxies and compares them with the power spectra of hi emission from the lmc .",
    "the spectra are very similar , suggesting that star formation follows a turbulent gas .",
    "optical light is more complex than hi emission , however , because dust and bright stars dominate the high spatial frequencies , stars have a mixture of ages , and there is no velocity information . nevertheless , optical passbands have much higher spatial resolution than radio , ccd images are available for most galaxies , and most of the features they show are closer to the actual star formation process than large - scale gas surveys , which have revealed primarily the low or moderate density phases so far .",
    "thus the power spectrum of optical light might reveal a connection between star complexes and spiral arms , but it probably can not distinguish between different models of turbulence , which all have similar power spectra .",
    "optical power spectra should also give a physical scale at which star formation becomes coherent .",
    "this scale could be several hundred parsecs to a kiloparsec , corresponding to the disk thickness and inverse jeans wavenumber ( zhang , fall , & whitmore 2001 ) .",
    "if this is the driving scale for the turbulence that generates star - formation structures , then the source of this turbulence would be the spiral instabilities that make flocculent arms . turbulence driving by spiral instabilities could also occur at smaller scales , followed by an inverse cascade in two dimensions ( wada , meurer , & norman 2002 ) , but our observations of features on small scales are hampered by pixel noise and a possible transition from 2-d to 3-d turbulence in the real interstellar media of these galaxies .    in the next section",
    ", we review the suggested connections between turbulent motions and power spectra of density or column density .",
    "section [ sect : lmc ] shows the normalized power spectrum of hi emission from the lmc , multiplied by @xmath3 to flatten the power - law part for easier interpretation .",
    "then section [ sect : data ] describes our galaxy data , section [ sect : six ] shows power spectra of optical emission from these galaxies , and section [ sect : energy ] discusses the likely energy sources for the turbulence that gives star formation its structure . in section [",
    "sect : m81 ] , we remove the lowest fourier components from the grand design galaxy , m81 , and show that the star formation patterns resemble those in a flocculent galaxy , aside from the obvious orbit crowding and reverse shear that accompanies the density wave . the results are summarized in section [ sect : sum ] .",
    "a second paper ( elmegreen , et al . 2003 ) determines the optical power spectra for another galaxy , m33 , which has a larger dynamic range for power law analysis than the current sample because of its smaller distance .",
    "this second paper also models the result in an attempt to explain the entire spectrum , rather than just the @xmath4 part that is emphasized here .",
    "one way to observe the correlated structure in a turbulent gas is with a fourier transform power spectrum , which is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts of the fourier transform of the emission , plotted as a function of the spatial frequency , @xmath5 . for two or three dimensions ,",
    "the spatial frequency is the quadratic sum of the spatial frequencies in each direction .",
    "the two - dimensional power spectra of milky way hi emission ( crovisier & dickey 1983 ; green 1993 ; dickey et al .",
    "2001 ) , hi absorption ( deshpande , dwarakanath , & goss 2000 ) , co ( sttzki et al .",
    "1998 ) , and iras 100 micron emission ( gautier , et al .",
    "1992 ; schlegel , finkbeiner , & davis 1998 ) are power laws with slopes of @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the same power laws were found for two - dimensional hi emission from the small and large magellanic clouds ( stanimirovic , et al .",
    "1999 ; elmegreen , kim , & staveley - smith 2001 ) and for dust emission from the small magellanic cloud ( stanimirovic et al . 2000 ) .",
    "power spectrum analyses of data cubes require special care to account for sharp boundaries .",
    "for example , dickey et al . ( 2001 ) multiplied the emission at the edge of their survey by a gaussian smoothing function .",
    "one way to avoid this problem is with the delta variance technique ( sttzki et al . 1998 ; zielinsky & sttzki 1999 ; ossenkopf , klessen , & heitsch 2001 ; bensch , sttzki , & ossenkopf 2001 ) , which does not try to fit a periodic function to the data .    for galaxies",
    ", the two - dimensional fourier transform has an additional problem in that it includes the structure from the exponential disk , which is generally not wanted in an analysis of interstellar clouds . for the small magellanic cloud studied by stanimirovic et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , this was not an issue because there is no disk .",
    "the lmc does have this problem , though , and for this reason , elmegreen , kim , & staveley - smith ( 2001 ) used one - dimensional fourier transforms of the azimuthal profiles .",
    "azimuthal profiles are ideal for fourier transforms because they are periodic and the systematic radial gradients in the disk do not contribute .",
    "one - dimensional power spectra have shallower slopes than two - dimensional spectra by one unit , so the azimuthal power spectrum of gas emission from a galaxy becomes a power law with a slope of @xmath8 .",
    "the connection between these power spectra for intensity or column density and the power spectrum of velocity fluctuations associated with turbulence is not obvious .",
    "lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) showed that the structure of line emission from a turbulent gas is the result of a combination of density and velocity irregularities , with the contribution from each depending on the ratio of the integrated width over the spectrum to the turbulent line width for the scale observed .",
    "they considered the power spectrum for three - dimensional density alone to be @xmath9 , and the power spectrum for three - dimensional velocity alone to be @xmath10 for wave number @xmath11 and wavelength @xmath12 . in this notation",
    ", kolmogorov turbulence would have @xmath13 .",
    "in the case of a shallow density spectrum , where @xmath14 , the power spectrum of the _ projected _ two - dimensional line emission varies from @xmath15 for a thin slice of the velocity spectrum ( i.e. , a single velocity channel width ) to a steeper function , @xmath16 , for a slice that is wider than the velocity dispersion on the scale @xmath17 . in the case of a steep density spectrum , @xmath18",
    ", the 2-d projected power spectrum varies from a different thin - slice limit , @xmath19 , to a steeper thick - slice function , @xmath20 , to the same very - thick slice limit , @xmath16 . in both cases",
    ", the thick - slice limit has the same projected two - dimensional power spectrum as the pure density spectrum in three dimensions .",
    "also in both cases , the shallowness of the thin - slice limit implies there is a lot of small scale projected structure in velocity channels that is purely the result of velocity crowding on the line of sight , i.e. , structure that has no density counterpart and therefore is not from physical objects like `` clouds '' in the usual sense ( see also ballesteros - paredes , vzquez - semadeni , & scalo 1999 ; pichardo , et al .",
    "2000 ) .    if there are no velocity fluctuations , then the two - dimensional power spectrum of projected emission from a physically thin slab on the line of sight ( thinner than @xmath17 ) is @xmath21 , which is shallower than the 3-d density spectrum by one unit ( lazarian et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "stanimirovic & lazarian ( 2001 ) found this predicted steepness variation with slice thickness in the hi emission - line power spectra from the small magellanic cloud , giving @xmath22 for the pure density index and @xmath23 for the pure velocity index .",
    "this latter index is slightly different than the power spectrum index for pure velocity in incompressible kolmogorov turbulence , which is @xmath24 .",
    "lazarian et al . (",
    "2001 ) also did numerical simulations of 3-d compressible turbulence in a self - gravitating , non - magnetic gas with star formation and coriolis forces ( representing a 300 pc piece of a galaxy ) and got the predicted power spectrum for thin slices and the predicted slope variation with velocity - slice thickness .",
    "goldman ( 2000 ) considered only the velocity integrated hi structure ( thick - slice limit ) in the smc observations by stanimirovic et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and assumed the projected density structure ( `` clouds '' ) is the result of a passive response to 3-d incompressible turbulent motions ( see also higdon 1984 ; dcamp & le bourlot 2002 ) .",
    "this would be analogous to the case of a dye tracer in an incompressible turbulent fluid .",
    "in this case , the two - point correlation function of the density is proportional to the two - point correlation function of the velocity , and the density power spectrum has the same slope as the velocity power spectrum .",
    "goldman showed that the hi emission always comes from cloudy structures that are very thin compared to the line of sight through the whole galaxy and because of this the power spectrum of the projected structure , with its observed slope of @xmath2 , corresponds to a power spectrum of 3-d velocity structure that has a slope of @xmath25 ( in the notation above ) .",
    "this is slightly steeper than the 3-d velocity structure in kolmogorov turbulence , which would have a slope of @xmath26 , whereas the 3-d velocity spectrum derived by stanimirovic & lazarian ( 2001 ) for the smc , with its slope of @xmath27 , is slightly shallower than kolmogorov .",
    "goldman ( 2000 ) interpreted his steep result as an effect of energy dissipation during the cascade of energy from large to small scales , and noted that observations by roy & joncas ( 1985 ) and simulations by vazquez - semadeni , ballesteros - paredes , & rodriguez ( 1997 ) got this result too .",
    "a medium consisting entirely of shock fronts would have a velocity power spectrum of the same slope ( vzquez - semadeni , et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "goldman ( 2002 ) also found that the power spectrum of density in his model steepens by one unit when the inverse wavenumber scale becomes smaller than the cloud - layer thickness , @xmath28 .",
    "this implies that the two - dimensional power spectrum of density for a passive scalar in a kolmogorov turbulent fluid should have a slope of @xmath29 for transverse scales larger than the thickness , where @xmath30 , and a slope of @xmath24 for transverse scales smaller than the thickness , where @xmath31 .",
    "one - dimensional strips through such a medium would therefore have power spectrum slopes that steepen from @xmath32 on large scales to @xmath29 on small scales , i.e. , differing by 1 in both cases .",
    "goldman ( 2002 ) did not consider that this steepening would be observed in galaxies , but it may have been observed already in the lmc hi emission ( elmegreen et al . 2001 ) and we attempt to observe it here again for optical galactic emission . if it can be observed , and if goldman s theory applies , then we have a good method for obtaining the line - of - sight thickness of a galaxy based entirely on the transverse patterns of optical starlight emission .",
    "analysis techniques other than fourier transform power spectra have also been used to relate velocity and density structures in a turbulent medium .",
    "for example , the structure function of an extinction map of the taurus region was found to compare well with the structure function for velocity in supersonic turbulence ( padoan , cambrsy & langer 2002 ) .",
    "this function involves the average value of the difference between the extinction or the velocity , respectively , at all pairs of points separated by some distance and raised to a power .",
    "the density and velocity correspondence in this case was not explained , however , but it could be another manifestation of density as a passive tracer for a type of turbulence that acts in a nearly incompressible way .",
    "for example , boldyrev , nordlund , & padoan ( 2002 ) propose a model for explaining structure functions in which turbulence is mostly solenoidal in the inertial ( power - law ) range and then becomes burgers - like ( sharp - edged and shock - dominated ) on small scales where dissipation occurs ; such a model makes density a passive scalar in the inertial range .",
    "another measure of structure is the probability distribution function for column density , which spans a range between log - normal and gaussian depending on the number of independent correlated regions on the line of sight ( vzquez - semadeni & garca 2001 ) .",
    "analysis techniques based on spectral line information , such as principal component analyses ( brunt & heyer 2002 ) or the spectral correlation function ( padoan , rosolowsky , & goodman 2001 ) are not useful for optical images .",
    "evidently , the physical processes that give rise to the density structure of interstellar gas are not completely determined .",
    "a medium filled with numerous cool clouds that are moved in bulk by gravitational forces associated with swing - amplified instabilities and by pressure forces associated with star formation should have some of the properties of a passive scalar convected by independent turbulent motions . if this turbulence is somewhat incompressible in the inertial range , then the two - dimensional power spectrum for projected column density can have a slope of @xmath24 to @xmath25 , depending on the importance of energy losses in the cascade to small scales , and on the prevalence of shock fronts and other sharp edges from ionization and stellar wind interactions .",
    "these slopes increase by 1 for one - dimensional scans , and they can increase by 1 again if the transverse dimension measured by @xmath17 is much larger than the line - of - sight thickness .",
    "the power spectrum of hi emission from azimuthal scans in the lmc is shown on the left in figure [ fig : lmc ] , using data from elmegreen et al .",
    "the curves are shifted upward for increasing galactocentric radii , as indicated .",
    "the wavenumber on the abscissa is normalized to the maximum value , which is the same for each curve and corresponds to an image scale of 2 pixels .",
    "the power spectra for large radii cover a wider wavenumber range than the power spectra for small radii because the scan length is larger at larger radii so the minimum wavenumber , normalized to @xmath33 , decreases inversely with radius .",
    "a similar diagram was shown in elmegreen , kim , & staveley - smith ( 2001 ) but with an error at the highest frequency inadvertently caused by interpolation between pixels .",
    "the azimuthal scan of noise from beyond the galaxy edge produces a power spectrum with a slope of @xmath34 , as shown by the dashed line .",
    "the slope at intermediate @xmath5 in each scan is @xmath35 and the slope at high @xmath5 up to @xmath36 is @xmath37 , as indicated by the straight lines at the top of the figure .",
    "the highest wavenumbers have a slope of about @xmath34 again , and therefore look dominated by noise ( this flattening at high @xmath5 was also found by lazarian et al .",
    "2001 in numerical simulations ) .",
    "the transition from @xmath32 to @xmath29 at physical scales of @xmath38 pc was interpreted by elmegreen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to be an indication of the line - of - sight disk thickness , following predictions by lazarian & pogosyan ( 2000 ) and goldman ( 2000 ) .",
    "padoan et al .",
    "( 2001b ) found a similar transition for this lmc data using a different technique .",
    "the variations in slope for these power spectra are difficult to see by eye , so we multiply each by @xmath3 , which has the effect of flattening the inertial range to a horizontal line . the right - hand side of figure [ fig : lmc ] shows these normalized power spectra .",
    "the short lines near some of the spectra at high frequency have a slope of @xmath34 in the normalized plot , which corresponds to a slope of @xmath29 in the power spectrum ; these lines indicate what the @xmath32 to @xmath29 transition should look like in a normalized , one - dimensional power spectrum .",
    "the galaxies in table 1 were chosen for their diverse spiral types and because of the large number of pixels in the available images , shown in figure [ fig : images ] .",
    "most of the data were obtained from the hubble space telescope s ( hst ) online archive ( www.stsci.edu ) , with the exception of ngc 3031 ( m81 ) , which was obtained by j.c .",

    "most galaxy images did not have bright foreground stars like m81 , so they were not cleaned .",
    "fourier cosine and sine transforms , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , were taken of each intensity scan , @xmath43 , using the direct sums , @xmath44 @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is the number of pixels in the azimuthal scan and @xmath5 is the wavenumber .",
    "an fft algorithm was not used because that would overly constrain the scan lengths .",
    "the power spectrum is the sum of the squares of these transforms : @xmath47 to reduce noise , the power spectra from 9 adjacent azimuthal scans separated by one pixel in radius were averaged together for all the results here .",

    "generally the normalized power spectra are approximately flat between 20 pc and 100 pc .",
    "this means the original power spectra have slopes near @xmath32 in this wavenumber region , making them resemble density structures from kolmogorov turbulence , or within the uncertainties , burgers turbulence ( giving a slope of @xmath49 ) .    at large radii ,",
    "the normalized power spectra have slopes near @xmath50 , as indicated by the dashed line , which means the original power spectra have a slope of @xmath51 . because this slope occurs in the outer parts of galaxies where the intensity is weak , it is probably from a combination of noise , random positions for remote flocculent arms , and weak long - range correlations .",

    "the relatively shallow part on large scales in the models is partly the result of using azimuthal scans rather than linear scans , i.e , flocculent arms are poorly correlated on opposite sides of the galaxy and well correlated with their immediate neighbors on the same side .",
    "the models also show a resolution effect in which the extended @xmath32 part comes partly from unresolved structures like clusters and ob associations , which have a range of sizes around the 100 pc scale we measure here .",

    "the results of the power spectrum analysis are summarized in table 2 , which gives the size ranges for the horizontal parts of the normalized power spectra in parsecs and in proportion to r@xmath53 , as indicated by the scales at the tops of the figures .",
    "there is little difference in the power spectra for flocculent and grand design galaxies .",
    "ngc 5055 is a flocculent galaxy and its power spectrum in figure [ fig : psn5055 ] is similar to that of m81 in figure [ fig : psm81 ] except for the strong components in m81 at low @xmath5 , which are from the spiral density wave .",
    "the maximum size of the horizontal part of the normalized power spectrum is generally larger at smaller radii than larger radii , where noise seems to dominate small @xmath5 .",
    "most galaxies have unresolved bright features that are intrinsic to the galaxy , in addition to faint foreground stars , and these distort the power spectra at high @xmath5 ( as in figure [ fig : azim ] ) . between these wavenumber limits ,",
    "four galaxies have clear regions where the normalized power spectra are approximately horizontal in these figures : m81 , ngc 4414 , ngc 5055 , and ngc 7217 .",
    "these horizontal parts suggest that the non - normalized power spectra decrease as @xmath4 , which is appropriate for column density structure in kolmogorov turbulence in a one - dimensional scan .",
    "unfortunately , the uncertainties from brightness variations among stars , pixel noise , and the limited power law range , make it impossible to distinguish between this slope and @xmath49 , for example , so we can not specify what type of turbulence might be causing these brightness patterns .",

    "this galaxy differs from the others in having very bright patches of well - resolved star formation throughout the disk .",
    "ngc 7742 has faint patches everywhere but in a ring of radius @xmath54 pc , where they are bright , and there is no evidence for a @xmath4 spectrum anywhere except possibly in this ring ( the third scan up from the bottom ) ; unfortunately , this ring also has so many bright pixels that the power spectrum is distorted .",
    "presumably the distance to ngc 7742 is too large to resolve the several - hundred pc outer scale for turbulence , so each star complex with this scale has a size of only a few tens of pixels .",
    "ngc 7217 has the same problems as ngc 7742 : it is too distant to resolve the turbulent structures and the star - formation patches are intrinsically faint .",
    "the meaning of the length scale at the top of the figures is @xmath17 in the azimuthal direction . because 1 on the lower abscissa corresponds to a wavenumber of @xmath33 , the length scale at the top",
    "is given by @xmath55 divided by the normalized scale at the bottom , for pixel size @xmath56 in radians and galaxy distance @xmath57 .",
    "this azimuthal length is not the same as the total feature length , which , because of shear , can be much larger if it is measured along a spiral arm .",
    "the typical length scale in the flat part of our power spectra is 100 pc , with a range between 50 pc and 1000 pc , depending on galaxy and galactocentric radius .",
    "this distance is comparable to the inverse of the jeans wavenumber in the interstellar gas , which is @xmath58 pc for velocity dispersion @xmath59 km s@xmath60 and disk mass surface density @xmath61 g @xmath62 m@xmath63 pc@xmath64 .",
    "star formation regions much larger than this in the azimuthal direction are apparently not coherent on average ( although a few individual regions might be ) , and those separated by more than this distance , such as those on opposite sides of the galaxy , are independent .",
    "star - forming regions smaller than @xmath65 pc tend to be correlated .",
    "the maximum scale for the @xmath4 part is also comparable to the perpendicular disk scale height .",
    "either this height , along with the jeans length , is a true maximum scale for star formation ( as suggested by efremov 1995 and others ) , or correlated regions with larger sizes are so much older , redder , and dimmer that they do not stand out in our optical images .",
    "a power spectrum analysis of very sensitive k - band images might find longer range correlations . according to the time - size correlation in efremov & elmegreen ( 1998 ) , regions 1 kpc in size , such as gould s belt , form stars for @xmath66 my , and these are still visible in our optical images .",
    "an extrapolation of this relation to regions 10 kpc in size suggests a formation time over @xmath38 my , in which case they should be dominated by stars of type a. a - star groupings of this size may exist without detection in the optical data used here .",
    "they would be relatively smooth , dim , and sheared into tight spirals .",
    "on the other hand , it is plausible that correlated regions much larger than a scale height do not exist because turbulent motions parallel the plane , driven by spiral instabilities for example , can not be much larger than turbulent motions perpendicular to the plane , which would have to be driven by 3-d mixing of the in - plane motions .",
    "a fixed ratio for these two speeds was suggested in simulations of spiral instabilities by huber & pfenniger ( 2001a ) .",
    "if the gravitational jeans length or the scale height in the ambient medium is the typical scale for coherent , star - forming structures , then the implication is that gaseous self - gravity initiates the formation of star - forming clouds , producing star complexes . a turbulent cascade to smaller scales forms smaller clouds and smaller stellar conglomerates , such as ob associations and subgroups , while shear stretches the complexes on larger scales into flocculent spirals",
    "this is beginning to be the standard model for star formation but now it has the additional aspect that all resolvable scales inside the unstable wavelength are hierarchically fractal for both the gas and the stars .",
    "this origin of structure on the jeans length also implies that much of the interstellar turbulence is from gravitational instabilities in the gas .",
    "this is consistent with recent numerical experiments ( see references in the introduction ) .",
    "the turbulent energy comes directly from gravitational binding energy of the gas layer .",
    "this is not a renewable energy source because collapse dissipates energy by radiation , so ultimately the energy of turbulence has to come from shear or stars .",
    "shear is not important on the scale of individual clouds because most of them are denser than the gravitational tidal density ( @xmath67 $ ] for oort @xmath68 and angular rate @xmath69 ) , so they can not be broken apart by shear .",
    "this is unlike the case for whole flocculent spirals , which are easily stretched by shear .",
    "numerical simulations with only self - gravity and shear get renewable spirals for this reason ( toomre & kalnajs 1991 ; sellwood & carlberg 1984 ; semelin & combes 2000 ; huber & pfenniger 2002 ) , but analogous simulations where dense clouds form can not break these clouds apart without something like star formation and young stellar pressures ( huber & pfenniger 2001a ; wada & norman 2001 ) . viscosity from cloud - cloud interactions in the presence of shear can also break apart spiral instabilities ( vollmer & beckert 2002 ) .",
    "the energy liberated by continuous spiral instabilities is important as a source of turbulence in the ism ( e.g. , vollmer & beckert 2002 ; wada , meurer , & norman 2002 ) .",
    "the power density is approximately the ism energy density @xmath70 multiplied by the instability growth rate , @xmath71 , which amounts to @xmath72 erg @xmath73 s@xmath60 in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this power input is important because the spiral growth time is comparable to crossing time over the disk thickness , and this is about the energy dissipation time from shocks and turbulent decay .",
    "the energy is comparable to that from supernovae at a rate of one per 100 years in a whole galaxy , assuming a 1% efficiency for converting the explosion energy into ism motions .",
    "both spiral instabilities and stars provide enough power to interstellar turbulence and cloud formation , but _ spiral instabilities may be preferred because they are pervasive , large - scale , and cold _ , which allows the gravity - driven motions to be supersonic and strongly compress the gas .",
    "stellar power is hotter and more localized , producing ionized and hot uniform cavities with cloudy debris at the edge in a turbulent shell or layer .",
    "the primary role of stellar energy on a large scale is to provide internal energy that reverses the cold collapse of cloud and star formation , thereby maintaining a steady state in the presence of continuous spiral instabilities .",
    "spiral instabilities can also move cold clouds around without much feedback from them in the form of pressure gradients .",
    "this can produce a type of structure that is analogous to a passive scalar in laboratory kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "the sharp edges in these cold clouds that are produced by ionization and stellar winds can steepen a three - dimensional density power spectrum from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , as discussed in section [ sect : density ] , but such sharp edges are not likely to show up in the stars unless very young regions are observed , as in the compressed ridge of orion ( reipurth , rodriguez & chini 1999 ) .",
    "thus we obtain something like the kolmogorov @xmath32 slope here ( for 1-d scans in the projected distribution of a passive scalar ) even though many of the stars in the optical images may have been triggered along sharp fronts by nearby high pressures .",
    "figure [ fig : m81floc ] shows the galaxy m81 without the 10 lowest fourier components .",
    "a few bright stars have also been removed .",
    "the remaining part of the galaxy image lies mostly in the power - law region of the power spectrum .",
    "the star formation features are patchy , sheared spirals that resemble flocculent spirals in other galaxies .",
    "they tend to be concentrated in the density - wave spiral arms ( see fig.[fig : ellipse ] ) because of the flow pattern , which moves the gas slower through the arms than the interarm regions .",
    "the flow also has an arm region with reverse shear , which gives some of the patches larger pitch angles than the arms ( balbus 1988 ; kim & ostriker 2001 ) . nevertheless , the intrinsic structure of these star - forming patches is hierarchical and self - similar , as indicated by the power spectrum , so the star formation process inside of them is more closely related to turbulence than to spiral waves .",
    "the detailed star formation processes are therefore the same in flocculent and grand design galaxies .",
    "the spiral arms in flocculent galaxies and the star - formation patches in grand design galaxies appear to be the largest optical features generated by turbulence with a near - kolmogorov scaling law .",
    "the similarity between the azimuthal sizes of these regions and the inverse of the critical jeans wavenumber suggests they form by gravitational instabilities in the ambient gas .",
    "these instabilities in the presence of shear compress and twist the gas into flocculent spiral arms , and they also generate supersonic turbulence , which cascades to smaller scales , making a hierarchy of cloud and star - formation structures .",
    "the reverse process of cloud destruction , which is required to ensure a steady state , is the role of star formation .",
    "the pressures associated with star formation also contribute to small scale turbulence .",
    "hierarchical structures for star formation have not yet been found in numerical simulations of galaxies or clouds , although this feature of turbulent gas alone has been simulated by several groups ( maclow & ossenkopf 2000 ; klessen 2000 ; ossenkopf , klessen , & heitsch 2001 ; ostriker , stone , & gammie 2001 ) .",
    "hierarchical structure in collapsing gas was simulated by semelin & combes ( 2000 ) , huber & pfenniger ( 2001a , 2002 ) , and chavanis ( 2002 ) .",
    "the simulations that are most relevant to what we find here were by huber & pfenniger ( 2001a ) , who got a fractal mass - size correlation in the spirals generated by gravitational instabilities in sheared gaseous disks , although their dynamic range was small .",
    "wada & norman ( 2001 ) also got chaotic spirals from disk instabilities ; their effective driving length was @xmath74 pc , similar to that observed here , but these authors did not analyze the correlations in their gas or star formation structures .",
    "the turbulent spirals in 2-d simulations by wada , meurer , & norman ( 2002 ) were found to have a 2-d energy power spectrum with a power - law slope of @xmath51 due to inverse cascade on scales larger than the driving scale of 10 pc , which was from self - gravity in the cold gas component . some of the power law range for structure observed optically here could be from an inverse cascade too , but the difference between this process and stretching from shear is not clear from the 2-d analysis in wada et al . , and the importance of shear has been minimized in our study by considering only the azimuthal profiles for the power spectra .",
    "the importance of inverse cascades in galaxies with a scale height larger than the jeans length in the cold component is also not clear .",
