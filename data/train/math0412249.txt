    "in zwiebach s study of oriented open - closed string theory @xcite , he considered a certain moduli space of riemann surfaces with boundary having closed punctures in the interior and open punctures on the boundary coming with parameterizations by the unit disk and upper half disk . while he did not consider it as such , this moduli space forms a 2-colored prop .",
    "in fact , an open - closed cft ( with one d - brane ) can be defined as an algebra over this prop , and an open - closed topological cft ( or string background ) can be defined as an algebra over its chains .",
    "the first purpose of this paper is to describe completely the homology of the biggest genus 0 structure inside this prop .",
    "the operad inside of this prop formed by spheres with no boundary is well known to be homotopy equivalent to the framed little disks operad .",
    "it is shown by getzler that its homology defines a bv - algebra @xcite .",
    "this extends the result by f. cohen @xcite showing that the homology of the non - framed little disks operad describes a gerstenhaber algebra . in @xcite , voronov invented the swiss - cheese operad which is a ( non framed ) finite dimensional model of the operad inside this prop formed by riemann spheres with one or no boundary components .",
    "he computed its homology and calls the algebra that it defines a swiss - cheese algebra .",
    "the algebra is defined on a pair of graded vector spaces @xmath0 and consists of a gestenhaber structure on @xmath1 , an associative multiplication on @xmath2 , and an algebra action of @xmath1 on @xmath1 . the framed version of swiss , h.e . to the subspace of spheres with one or no boundary components , has the same result except that @xmath1 is a bv - algebra .",
    "the biggest genus 0 operad inside this prop is formed by all spheres with boundary having exactly one puncture labeled as an output .",

    "however , there is a bigger genus 0 structure in this prop containing this operad .",
    "the subspace of all genus 0 surfaces , with an arbitrary number of inputs and outputs , forms what s called a _ dioperad _ , invented by gan in @xcite .",
    "a dioperad only considers compositions which attach one input to one output so as to create no genus .",
    "the first four sections of this paper together give a complete description of the homology of this dioperad .",
    "restricting the description of the dioperad to the generators with one output and the relations only involving them gives a description of the biggest genus 0 operad in the prop .",

    "use it to realize the pair @xmath123 as an algebra over @xmath67 where @xmath9 is a fixed oriented closed submanifold of dimension k and @xmath8 is the space of paths starting and ending in @xmath9 .",
    "let s first recall what the cacti operad is and how we get @xmath6 as an algebra over its homology .",
    "basically , cacti is what results when you get rid of everything in @xmath108 except the boundaries of the closed inputs and outputs . a typical point in cacti(n )",
    "is shown in the following picture :        : a point is given by a tree like configuration of n labeled circles ( lobes ) of varying radii .",
    "each circle is parameterized by marking a point on it .",
    "when 3 or more circles intersect at one point , they are given a cyclic order ( can draw using counter clock - wise orientation of the plane ) . finally ,",
    "if you start at any point on some circle and trace the picture in the counter clock - wise direction , using the cyclic orderings to jump from circle to circle , then the entire picture will be traversed before returning to the starting point .",
    "thus putting one more marked point on the picture gives it an @xmath124 parametrization and we consider the whole boundary as the output . to compose two pictures ,",
    "just replace the input circle of one picture with the entire second picture by rescaling the length of the second picture to math the length of the input and then identifying them via their parameterizations .",
    "+ if we consider the space of maps from a point in @xmath125 into our manifold @xmath3 , then restricting to the inputs gives us an embedding from this space of maps to @xmath126 of finite codimension @xmath127 .",
    "restricting to the output gives a map into @xmath4 .",
    "thus we get the following diagram : + @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the space of pairs @xmath130 and @xmath131 has finite codimension @xmath127 .    applying the pontryagin - thom construction to the map",
    "@xmath132 to get the push - forward map in homology , and then composing , we get the action @xmath133 .",
    "this map has degree @xmath134 and gives an operad morphism , i.e. it commutes with composition and is equivariant .",
    "the operations corresponding to the generators of @xmath135 and @xmath136 are exactly the bv operations of chas - sullivan .    in our situation ,",
    "if we consider maps from a point in @xmath18 to the manifold @xmath3 such that all boundary components map into the submanifold @xmath9 , then restricting to the @xmath124 boundary of a closed input / output gives a point in @xmath4 and restricting to the arc of the boundary of an open input / output gives a point in @xmath137 .",
    "thus we get a similar diagram as above with @xmath138 and we just need to replace @xmath18 by a skeletal model which will make the left arrow a finite codimensional embedding .",
    "right away we see , however , that we can not contract away enough of a surface to get a finite codimensional embedding and get a space h.e . to @xmath18 since we have these boundary components with no open inputs or outputs on them .",
    "it is possible to define an operad which ignores these empty boundary components and gives us finite codim .",
    "embeddings , but the resulting action does not commute with composition . this can be seen by considering the degrees of the induced operations .",
    "thus we are forced to keep the empty boundary components in our picture .",
    "this in turn forces us to keep the part of the boundaries in between two open inputs so that composition gives an empty boundary when it should .",
    "both of these maps are of finite codimension , the first of codim @xmath141 and the second of codim @xmath142 .",
    "so we can get the push forward maps in homology and compose to get operations .",
    "the key observation is that if we plug the fundamental class of @xmath143 into the @xmath144 s then the two resulting operations are the same degree @xmath145 operation .",
    "this is the operation which is induced at the chain level by the function which takes two cells in @xmath8 and transversally intersects the endpoints of the intervals of the first cell with the beginning points of the second cell and transversally intersects the beginning points of the first cell with the endpoints of the last cell .",
    "this results in a chain in @xmath4 of dimension @xmath141 less than the sum of the dimensions of the two cells .          the left picture results in an operation of degree @xmath146 while the right one gives a @xmath147 degree operation .",
    "this is a problem since these two pictures would be in the same path component of our potential colored cacti . to remedy this ,",
    "`` ghost edges '' are introduced :          this map has codimension @xmath149 no matter how the two circles are connected by the ghost edge .",
    "if we plug in the fundamental classes in @xmath143 and @xmath150 after getting the push forward , then we get a degree @xmath146 operation which is the same as the operation given by the left picture above .",
    "this is the operation which takes 4 cells in @xmath8 , applies the operation described above to the first two and the last two resulting in two chains in @xmath4 , and then takes the loop product of these two chains as in chas - sullivan .",
    "+ these two observations motivate the following :    * _ open - closed cacti _ * + the definition will be given by considering the following pictures which show show typical points in the configuration space .",
    "first consider the case where the output is closed :        : + the inputs are labeled .",
    "green circles are closed inputs and red intervals are open inputs .",
    "+ there is a marked point somewhere on the picture giving the starting point of the output .",
    "if the marked point is on a circle , go in the counter clockwise direction .",
    "if it s on a ghost edge , there needs to be an arrow pointing in the starting direction .",
    "then if we take the cyclic ordering of the edges meeting at a vertex to be given by counter clockwise orientation of the plane , there is a @xmath124 parametrization of the picture as in cacti .",
    "+ the closed inputs should have a mark as in cacti .",
    "+ for a black circle ( empty boundary component ) with more than one vertex , mark one of the vertices .",
    "this marks where a boundary edge ( black interval ) `` sews up '' into a circle when composing .",
    "+ we can make our definition so that there is always @xmath151 ghost edges when there are @xmath75 circles .",
    "we need this so that there are the same number of @xmath152 s to map into as above for any two pictures in the same path component .",
    "this is done by choosing @xmath153 of the rays emanating from an intersection vertex which is not on a circle and has @xmath154 ghost rays emanating from it . for the chosen @xmath153 rays ,",
    "the rays are considered as ghost edges for which this vertex is an endpoint .",
    "the other two rays are considered as one ghost edge and this vertex is just in the middle of it .",
    "for example , in the above picture , there are three ghost edges , not 5 , connecting the four circles in the middle .",
    "the following picture shows the three different ways to connect three circles with 2 ghost edges which intersect off of the circles and the path in the configuration space which connects them . after seeing this example ( and after seeing the picture for the case of an open output ) , it is not hard to see why the path components of open - closed cacti are in correspondence with the path components of @xmath18 :              : + here , the number of ghost edges is equal to the number of circles .",
    "+ the interval at the bottom corresponds to boundary component containing the open output .",
    "+ if we start at the right of the interval and use the counter clock - wise orientation of the plane , we traverse the entire picture and end up at the left endpoint of the interval .",
    "this gives us a parametrization of the picture by the unit interval and will serve as the output .",
    "+ if there are no open inputs on the same boundary comp as the output , then this interval should just be a black point ( which should be sent to the submanifold @xmath9 when we consider maps into our manifold @xmath3 to get an action )",
    ".    we can compose pictures by identifying the parametrization of a input circle or interval with the rescaled output parametrization of an entire picture , as in cacti . if the endpoint of a ghost edge lies on the input circle or interval , and",
    "if when we compose it happens that this endpoint is connected to the interior of a 2nd ghost edge in the picture we are replacing the input with , then this should not break the 2nd ghost edge into two edges .",
    "as described above , this endpoint just lies in the middle of this 2nd ghost edge .",
    "also , when connecting the endpoint to a 2nd ghost edge ( interior or endpoint ) , there is natural way to cyclically order the ghost rays emanating from this point of attachment in the result .",
    "just `` stick '' the cyclic order of all the ghost edges in the input picture for which this point on the input circle ( or interval ) is an endpoint into the cyclic order of the ghost rays emanating from this point of attachment in the output picture in between the ray which comes right before this point in the output parametrization and the ray which comes right after this point in the output parametrization .",
    "for example , the following picture show the 3 different ways the ghost edges ending at a point on the input circle can be attached to the intersection point of two ghost edges :        thus we see that after giving this configuration space its natural topology , as with cacti or the sullivan chord diagrams of @xcite , it forms a well - defined topological 2-colored operad which we ll call _ open - closed cacti _ or _",
    "oc cacti_.      it is clear that the path components are in bijective correspondence .",
    "fix a path component of @xmath156 . in a similar manner as in the proof of the homotopy type of a path component of @xmath18 ( dioperad ) in sec .",
    "4 , assume first that this path component has @xmath75 green circles ( closed inputs ) , @xmath76 circles with exactly one open input , and @xmath77 completely black circles ( empty boundary components ) .",
    "if the path component has an open output then assume that there are no open inputs on the interval ( so the interval is really a point ) , i.e. the boundary component possessing the open output does not have an open input for the points in the corresponding path component of @xmath18 .",
    "then this path component is h.e . to @xmath157 except that @xmath77 of the circles are not labeled and do not have a marked point .",
    "and we know @xcite that cacti is h.e . to @xmath158 , the framed little disks operad .",
    "thus it follows that this path component is h.e . to the configuration of @xmath159 disks inside the unit disk",
    "such that @xmath78 of the disks have labels and directions and l of the disks have neither directions nor labels .",
    "but this is the homotopy type of the corresponding path component in @xmath18 , as described in sec .",
    "4 . finally , just as in @xmath18 , the forgetful map from an arbitrary path component to the space obtained from this path comp . by dropping all but one fixed open input on each of the circles with 2 or more open inputs and dropping all inputs on the interval is a fibre bundle with contractible fibre .",
    "thus we have a vector space isomorphism from @xmath67 to @xmath155 given by these homotopy equivalences of the path components .",
    "but it is clear that this map respects compositions of generators .",
    "so they are isomorphic as colored operads",
    ".     + first , let s consider the diagram associated to a fixed point @xmath160 .",
    "if @xmath161 is the number of closed inputs , @xmath162 the number of open inputs , @xmath163 the number of black intervals + the number of black circles , and @xmath164 the number of ghost edges , then we have : + @xmath165 or @xmath8    the maps should send all black intervals and circles into the submanifold @xmath9 .",
    "if the output is open , then the endpoints of the interval should also be sent into @xmath9 ( if this interval is really a point , then this point should go into @xmath9 ) .",
    "remember that one of the vertices of a black circle is marked so that a map restricted to this circle gives us a point in @xmath166 .",
    "the map @xmath131 is an embedding of finite codimension .",
    "so we can get the push forward map in homology and then plug the fundamental classes into the @xmath144 s and @xmath167 s to obtain an operation + @xmath168 or @xmath169 .",
    "the codimension can be computed and thus the degree of this operation . in the case of a closed output ,",
    "the degree is @xmath170 $ ] . in the case of an open output",
    "the degree is @xmath171 $ ] .",
    "these degrees are exactly what they should be .",
    "that is , if we build the path component of @xmath172 out of the generators of @xmath173 via a tree in normal form , then the degree of the operation given by @xmath172 agrees with the degree of the operation given by composing in the same way the operations in @xmath174 corresponding to points in the generating path components .",
    "next , consider the path component @xmath79 where @xmath175 .",
    "we `` almost '' have the following diagram : + @xmath176 or @xmath177 , where @xmath178 + the issue is that there are choices that would have to be made for each @xmath175 in order to get a map @xmath131 and it is not clear that this can be done in a continuous way . for the black intervals of the picture",
    ", there is a canonical way to choose the starting point of the interval and which @xmath139 it corresponds to .",
    "but for the ghost edges there is no canonical way to choose which endpoint is its starting point and which @xmath152 it corresponds to .",
    "also , there is no canonical way to choose which @xmath139 a black circle corresponds to .",
    "there is no way to add these labels to our operad such that it does nt matter the order in which we compose @xmath75 pictures into the @xmath75 inputs of a picture .",
    "however , it is not necessary to change the definition of @xmath18 cacti .",
    "let @xmath81 be the space obtained from @xmath79 by labeling the ghost edges and black circles , and marking one endpoint on each ghost edge .",
    "then @xmath179 is a quotient map by a finite and free action so that the induced map @xmath180 is onto ( remember we are over a field of characteristic 0 ) .",
    "in fact , it should give an isomorphism when restricted to any path component in @xmath181 ( to see @xmath81 might not be path connected , just consider the case of two green circles with one ghost edge connecting them ) .",
    "now , we do have the above diagram for @xmath81 .",
