    "monte carlo models have played an important and irreplaceable role in both low and high - energy physics .",
    "first of all , they are needed to simulate the physics and detector capabilities for any proposed experiment .",
    "they are necessary to study the efficiency , acceptance corrections and background in the analyses of experimental data .",
    "they are also very useful tools for theorists to test and estimate the consequences of new physics ideas and phenomena .",
    "this is especially true for high - energy heavy - ion collisions .    in order to study the properties of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in the early stage of heavy - ion collisions and to search for evidence of the qcd phase transition",
    ", one needs to understand the whole evolution history of the collisions .",
    "since the reaction dynamics is very complex and there is not a simple standard analytic model , one has to rely on monte carlo models to incorporate many aspects of strong interactions in the simulation of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the models and parameters therein can be constrained by well - tested theories and experimental data especially in @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions where qgp is not expected to form .",
    "they provide a baseline calculation of physical observables in the absence of new physics due to the formation of qgp . however , large uncertainties exist in extrapolating to @xmath4 collisions",
    ". comparisons of results produced by different monte carlo models or by varying the model parameters are useful to provide a measure of the extrapolation uncertainties .",
    "the latest rhic data @xcite have proven to provide good constraints on monte carlo models that in turn help us to understand the reaction dynamics and the initial conditions .",
    "finally , monte carlo models also serve as theoretical laboratories to test proposed signals and probes of qgp such as jet quenching @xcite .",
    "there are many monte carlo models for heavy - ion collisions , reflecting the complexity of the problems .",
    "but in general they can be divided into three categories .",
    "hadron and string based models , _",
    "e.g. _ , fritiof @xcite , dpm @xcite , venus @xcite , rqmd @xcite , arc @xcite , art @xcite , urqmd @xcite , luciae @xcite and others , consider hadrons and lund strings @xcite as the effective degrees of freedom in strong interactions .",
    "depending on the center - of - mass energy of a two - body collision , particles are produced through resonances and strings which hadronize according to the lund string fragmentation model @xcite .",
    "these models are adequate for particle production and rescattering in hadronic and nuclear collisions at energies around or below the cern - sps , in which partonic degrees of freedom are not yet important . at high energies ( @xmath5 gev ) , hard or semi - hard partonic scatterings become important and contribute significantly to the particle production and dominate the high @xmath0 hadron spectra even at the cern - sps energy . in this case , pqcd - inspired models , _",
    "e.g. _ , hijing @xcite , vni @xcite nexus @xcite and ampt @xcite , are more relevant .",
    "the third class of models , such as lexus @xcite , pqcd parton model @xcite , parton cascade models @xcite and hydrodynamic models @xcite , are not strictly event generators .",
    "but they are useful to help us to understand particle production and evolution in heavy - ion collisions , many aspects of which are difficult to simulate in an event generator .",
    "i will not give a review of these models @xcite here .",
    "instead , i will concentrate on the parton based models and discuss the essential physics behind them . in particular",
    ", i will discuss the interplay between soft and hard processes and their different behaviors in multiple parton scattering processes .",
    "i will demonstrate the difficulties in incorporating quantum interferences in monte carlo models and how one can use mission specific models such as the pqcd parton model to overcome these difficulties .",
    "not long after the importance of minijets in both high - energy @xmath6 @xcite and heavy - ion collisions @xcite was realized , two parton - based monte carlo models @xcite were developed to incorporate hard processes in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the jet production cross section in these hard processes can be described very well by the pqcd parton model when the transverse momentum transfer @xmath0 involved is very large .",
    "however , the pqcd parton model calculation of jet cross sections diverges when @xmath7 and the processes become non - perturbative .",
    "no theoretical model exists that can describe both the large and small @xmath0 processes . in order to combine hard processes and non - perturbative soft processes in a monte carlo model , a cut - off scale @xmath8 in transverse momentum transfer of parton scattering is introduced that phenomenologically separates soft and hard processes .",
    "assuming eikonalization of these processes , one can calculate the @xmath6 cross section in this two - component model @xcite , @xmath9,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the nucleon - nucleon overlap function , @xmath11 is a parameter to represent inclusive soft parton cross section and @xmath12 is calculated from pqcd parton model , @xmath13 the two parameters , @xmath8 and @xmath12 in this two - component model can be fixed by the experimental data on the cross sections of @xmath6 collisions and the corresponding @xmath14 .",
    "this is the basic principle behind hijing @xcite , vni @xcite and the recent nexus @xcite .",
    "in this two - component model , the rapidity density of charged multiplicity can be expressed as @xmath15 in hijing , soft particle production is modeled by a string model whose contribution to @xmath14 is almost constant .",
    "the contribution from minijet production , on the other hand , increases with energy due to the increase of the inclusive jet cross section .",
    "to extend to nuclear collisions , one has to consider the nuclear dependences of these two components . for the soft part , the interaction is coherent and its contribution to the multiplicity should be proportional to the number of wounded nucleons . on the other hand , minijet production is approximately incoherent and proportional to the number of binary collisions , modulo the nuclear shadowing of parton distributions and jet quenching .",
    "the total charged hadronic rapidity density will acquire the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the averaged inclusive jet cross section per @xmath18 collision in @xmath4 , which is generally smaller than @xmath19 due to nuclear shadowing of parton distributions .",
    "the energy dependence of the minijet cross section @xmath17 in the hadronic multiplicity is then amplified by @xmath20 in heavy - ion collisions relative to @xmath21 by the binary nature of semi - hard processes .",

    "assuming direct proportionality between parton and the final hadron number , the energy and nuclear dependence of the total hadronic rapidity density in central @xmath30 collisions can then be estimated . as shown ,",
    "the ekrt result is remarkably close to the hijing results and is also consistent with the rhic data .",
    "however , a critical difference between these models is the centrality dependence of @xmath31 . in the hijing two - component model of minijet production",
    "the multiplicity per participant increases with @xmath26 according to eq.([eq : nch ] ) while it actually _ decreases _ in the ekrt model with increasing @xmath26 due to the saturation requirement . in order to distinguish the fixed - scale and saturation models of entropy production ,",

    "the rhic data clearly favor the the latter case .",
    "naively , @xmath33 . the deviation from such a simple dependence in hijing calculation might be due to a combined effect of jet quenching and dilute edges in nuclear distributions used in hijing . also shown as dashed line is the simple two - component model in eq .",

    "the jet cross section @xmath39 used in the two - component model ( dashed line ) is calculated with nuclear shadowing of parton distributions averaged over mini - biased events .",
    "shadowing reduces the effective jet cross section and thus minijet contribution to charged multiplicity . without shadowing ,",
    "the two - component model will over - predict the charged multiplicity in central @xmath25 collisions .",
    "however , parton shadowing should depend on the impact - parameter of nuclear collisions .",
    "if an impact - parameter dependent parton shadowing as described in hijing @xcite is used , the effective jet cross section @xmath39 should also depend on centrality . using this @xmath22-dependent cross section in eq .",
