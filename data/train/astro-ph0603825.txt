    "the case for dark - matter haloes around spiral galaxies is predominantly based on the flatness of the rotation curves observed for gas out to large radii . for large elliptical galaxies at the centres of clusters ,",
    "similarly strong evidence comes from x - ray haloes and from the kinematics of stellar tracers such as globular clusters out to a few effective radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for more isolated ,",
    "` field ' ellipticals , however  or even those off - centre within clusters  the picture is somewhat less clear . for example",
    ", the projected velocity - dispersion profiles , @xmath0 , of planetary nebulae in four such galaxies have been measured to several effective radii by @xcite and @xcite . although these data probe regions that are expected to be dynamically dominated by dark matter , the dispersion profiles are found to decrease outwards in a manner consistent with the assumption that light traces mass , i.e. , that there are no extended dark haloes . however , unlike rotation curves , @xmath0 profiles do not directly measure the total mass distribution , but are also affected by the density and velocity - anisotropy profiles of the tracers themselves .",
    "the importance of velocity anisotropy particularly has been emphasised by @xcite and @xcite , who showed that falling dispersion profiles for elliptical galaxies are perfectly consistent with massive dark - matter haloes , in contrast to the original conclusion by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have recently derived a velocity - dispersion profile for tracers at large radii in the galactic stellar halo ( globular clusters , horizontal - branch and red - giant stars , and dsph satellites ) , finding a falling @xmath0 much like in the isolated ellipticals . in analysing these data",
    ", they carefully consider the effects of velocity anisotropy and conclude that ( 1 ) a strictly flat circular - speed curve , corresponding to an isothermal _ total _ mass profile for our galaxy , can be ruled out if the tracers velocity anisotropy is spatially constant , and ( 2 ) a massive dark halo is consistent with the data only if its density falls off rapidly beyond @xmath8kpc and/or the stellar tracers are on predominantly near - circular orbits at these radii .",
    "underlying this argument by @xcite is an assumption that the stellar tracers follow a power - law density profile , @xmath9 all the way out . in their appendix b",
    ", these authors briefly addressed some possible consequences of relaxing this assumption , if the tracer velocity - anisotropy profile is assigned one specific form .",
    "however , they did not pursue any detailed modelling with the tracer @xmath10 allowed to deviate from a pure power law .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to develop such models .",
    "we find that , since the velocity data from @xcite reach more than halfway to the virial radius of the galaxy  probing regions where the stellar density is unconstrained observationally , and even approaching what might be viewed as a natural ` edge ' to the stellar halo  our ignorance of the detailed density distribution of the far stellar halo is at least as important as uncertainties in the tracers velocity anisotropy when attempting to use the observed @xmath0 to infer anything about the mass profile of the galaxy .    before considering the milky way data specifically ,",
    "let us first review the factors affecting the velocity dispersion of a tracer population .",
    "we assume dynamical equilibrium and spherical symmetry , denote the tracers density profile by @xmath10 , and characterise the total galactic mass distribution by its circular - speed curve @xmath11 .",
    "then the radial component @xmath12 of the tracer population s velocity dispersion must satisfy the jeans equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the usual velocity anisotropy parameter of the tracers ( @xmath15 for isotropy , @xmath16 for radial anisotropy , and @xmath17 for a tangentially biased velocity distribution ) .    in the simple situation of constant anisotropy @xmath18 , and power laws for both the tracer density profile and the galaxy s circular - speed curve , @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ", the jeans equation requires that @xmath21 which reduces to equation ( b2 ) of @xcite in the special case @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "thus , both components of @xmath24 are proportional to @xmath25 , and they fall with radius if and only if the circular speed does .",
    "more realistically however , @xmath18 and/or @xmath26 will be functions of radius ; but we expect that at relatively large radii these will vary slowly enough for equation ( [ eq : sigma : power ] ) to be still approximately valid and provide some heuristic insight into the general behaviour of @xmath0",
    ".    first , then , let @xmath27 decrease with radius , so that the tracer velocity distribution becomes more tangentially biased at larger radii . in this case , the denominators in equation ( [ eq : sigma : power ] ) increase , so that @xmath12 falls relative to @xmath28",
    ". thus @xcite , working with strictly constant @xmath29 , conclude that a rather strongly decreasing anisotropy profile is necessary to reconcile their observed falling @xmath12 profile with a standard ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  nfw  ) model for the mass distribution of the milky way .    for @xmath30 ( which holds in the galactic halo and the outskirts of ellipticals ) ,",
    "the effect on @xmath31 is dominated by the _ numerator _ in equation  ( [ eq : sigma : power ] ) , such that a decreasing @xmath27 results in @xmath32 rising relative to @xmath28 . the effect on the projected line - of - sight velocity dispersion",
    "is dominated by @xmath31 ( but complicated by the projection ) and results in the well - known degeneracy between the velocity anisotropy and the mass profile , which has plagued the interpretation of the velocity - dispersion profiles of ellipticals ( for a recent exploration of this problem , see * ? ? ?",
    "second , suppose instead that @xmath33 increases with radius ( corresponding to @xmath10 decaying faster than a power law ) while @xmath18 remains constant . in this case ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : sigma : power ] ) tells us that both @xmath12 and @xmath32 fall relative to @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , if  for example  the tracer density decays exponentially , the anisotropy is fixed at @xmath34 , and the galaxy circular speed is constant ( @xmath22 ) , then we find from an _ exact _ solution of the jeans equation  ( [ eq : jeans ] ) that @xmath35 : the velocity dispersion declines like that for a power - law @xmath10 in a keplerian potential , even though the rotation curve is flat !    an even more drastic behaviour results from a tracer population which is truncated at a finite radius @xmath36 . in this case , @xmath37 as @xmath38 and from equation  ( [ eq : sigma : power ] ) we expect both components of the velocity dispersion to vanish in this limit . thus , the falling @xmath12 observed for the stellar halo of the milky way may still be consistent with a roughly flat circular - speed curve , if the tracer population effectively dies out at some large radius .",
    "this is the possibility that we pursue in more detail in section  [ sec : mw ] .",
    "note that for elliptical galaxies the tracer density is known , so that this problem does not arise in the interpretation of their velocity dispersions .",
    "the data collected by @xcite comprise heliocentric radial velocities corrected for the solar motion relative to the galactic centre , yielding velocities , @xmath39 , in a galactic standard of rest .",
    "however , these velocities must still be referred to the galactic centre before comparing to any model .",
    "thus , using spherical polar coordinates with the centre of the milky way at the origin , and the sun on the @xmath40-axis at distance @xmath41kpc , we express the instantaneous distance @xmath42 from an object to the sun as @xmath43 the time derivative of this is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 the velocity dispersion at a given galactocentric radius @xmath46 is estimated as the rms velocity averaged over all solid angles : @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the averaging over the sphere . using @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we thus obtain @xmath51 with @xmath52 a monotonically declining function of radius : @xmath53 the correction factor in equation  ( [ eq : sigma : corr ] ) becomes unity for an isotropic velocity distribution ( @xmath15 ) , since in this case the velocity dispersion is independent of direction . for non - zero @xmath18 ,",
    "the correction is greatest for small @xmath46 , where @xmath54 becomes largest ( @xmath55 at @xmath56 and @xmath57 at @xmath58 ) , while for @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "unfortunately , @xcite use an incorrect formula to convert between @xmath62 and @xmath63 [ their equation  ( 3 ) corresponds to ( [ eq : sigma : corr ] ) above ] , which gives a correction factor larger than unity for @xmath15 .",
    "this significantly affects the predicted @xmath63 only at radii @xmath64kpc .",
    "however , this is where the uncertainties in the observed @xmath63 are smallest , resulting in substantially erroneous @xmath65 for any model fits .",
    "let us now employ some simple , fully analytic models of truncated density profiles to demonstrate that the milky way @xmath63 data are consistent with a flat circular - speed curve , i.e. , an isothermal total - mass distribution .",
    "we assume that the density of the tracer population , outside of some ( small ) core radius , is given by @xmath66 which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rho : trunc ] for @xmath67 and @xmath68 , 2 , or 3 . at small radii ,",
    "say @xmath69 , the profiles in this graph are hardly distinguishable from a pure power - law @xmath70 , which matches the density of the galactic stellar halo out to @xmath71kpc @xcite .",
    "the abruptness of the truncation towards larger radii depends on the parameter @xmath72 .",
    "we have used the online database of @xcite to verify that , for @xmath73kpc , a model with @xmath67 and @xmath74 provides a good description of the density of galactic globular clusters at @xmath75kpc .",
    "this is thus the model we use for all applications to data in this paper .",
    "given equation ( [ eq : rho : trunc ] ) , a constant anisotropy @xmath18 for the tracers , and a power - law circular - speed curve , @xmath76 , the radial component of the velocity dispersion can be obtained analytically from the jeans equation ( [ eq : jeans ] ) for integer @xmath72 : @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79      \\displaystyle      \\;\\frac{1}{q}(x^{-q}-1 ) & \\text{for $ q\\neq0$}.    \\end{cases}\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath38 , @xmath80 , as the simple considerations of section  [ sec : intro ] already implied it must .",
    "( in this limit equation  ( [ eq : sigmar : trunc ] ) is numerically unstable against truncation errors , but instead one may use @xmath81\\ ] ] with @xmath82 . )    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig : trunc ] , we plot @xmath12 for a flat rotation curve ( @xmath22 ) and @xmath67 , @xmath74 ( appropriate to the situation in the milky way stellar halo ) , and for various @xmath18 .",
    "evidently , the velocity dispersion declines over much the whole range of radii , even though the density deviates from the power - law form only for large radii .",
    "the physical reason is that in order to achieve a truncation in density , orbits that reach near @xmath36 must be de - populated relative to a non - truncated model .",
    "these orbits , however , would have contributed at smaller radii with rather large @xmath83 .",
    "note that all the models presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig : trunc ] are physical in the sense that they possess a non - negative distribution function of the form @xmath84 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : trunc : mw ] , we compare these simple models ( after applying the geometric correction of section  [ sec : geocorr ] ) to the @xmath85 data of @xcite . the tracer density again has @xmath67 and @xmath74 , and we set the truncation radius to @xmath86kpc . we assume a constant circular speed of @xmath87kms@xmath88 and constant @xmath18 of 0 ( isotropic ) , 0.25 , or 0.5 ( radially anisotropic ) .",
    "all these models correctly reproduce the decline of @xmath24 towards larger radii .    at small radii ( @xmath89kpc ) , the isotropic model ( solid curve ) can not account for the observed dispersion , but falls significantly below . since at these radii @xmath90 is observationally secure",
    ", we have from equation  ( [ eq : sigma : power ] ) that @xmath91 for any isotropic model if @xmath28 is near - flat just outside the solar circle .",
    "a possible explanation of the observed high @xmath63 for a tracer population with isotropic velocities requires a circular - speed curve which rises like @xmath92 out to @xmath93kpc ( where then @xmath94kms@xmath88 ) . alternatively and more reasonably , the data are consistent with a near constant @xmath87kms@xmath88 if the tracer velocities at @xmath89kpc are slightly radially biased with @xmath95 , comparable to what has been derived for halo stars in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "the above analysis shows that the @xcite data _ are _ in fact consistent with constant velocity anisotropy for the tracers and an isothermal total mass distribution for the milky way .",
    "we can further ask whether the same data are consistent with a more detailed model explicitly including both a stellar disc  which is well known to dominate the total mass inside the solar circle ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and still contributes @xmath96 to the mass at 50kpc  and an extended dark - matter halo which is ( as per cosmological @xmath97-body simulations ) non - isothermal .",
    "we first specify an exponential stellar disc with rotation curve @xmath98 \\",
    ", \\ ] ] where @xmath99 and @xmath100kpc according to @xcite .",
    "second , we take a dark - matter halo from the family of models developed by @xcite . specifically , we assume that the halo follows the scaling @xmath101 ( consistent with simulations ) and has an isotropic velocity distribution at its centre ( but may be anisotropic elsewhere ) .",
    "such a halo has a density cusp @xmath102 in the limit @xmath103 , and @xmath104 as @xmath105 .",
    "thus , it has a finite total mass , and its circular - speed curve is @xmath106 ^ 5,\\ ] ] from equation ( 20f ) of @xcite .    to fix the halo parameters , we specify the value of the _ total _ circular speed , @xmath107 , at two galactocentric radii : at the position of the sun , @xmath108kpc",
    ", we require @xmath87kms@xmath88 , while at @xmath109kpc we adopt @xmath110kms@xmath88 . this latter value corresponds to a total mass of @xmath111 inside @xmath109kpc , chosen in order to agree with the analysis of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "these two constraints then imply @xmath112 and @xmath113kpc .",
    "the total mass @xmath114 here is obtained formally by integrating the dark - matter density profile to infinity , but physically more meaningful is the halo mass within finite radii corresponding to specific over - densities relative to the critical @xmath115 .",
    "first , in a ` concordance ' @xmath116-cdm cosmology with @xmath117 and @xmath118 , the virial radius of a halo is that within which the average density @xmath119 is equal to @xmath120 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with @xmath121kms@xmath88mpc@xmath88 , @xmath122kpc and @xmath123 for our model ,",
    "both of which are reasonable for an @xmath124 galaxy like the milky way .",
    "alternatively , haloes are commonly measured by the radius @xmath125 within which the average density is @xmath126 . in our case , @xmath127kpc and @xmath128 . for comparison with numbers given by @xcite , the total mass inside 120kpc",
    "is @xmath129 .",
    "a scale of interest in connection with numerical simulations of dark - matter haloes is the radius @xmath130 at which the local logarithmic slope of the density profile is @xmath131 . in our model , @xmath132kpc , and",
    "the ratio @xmath133 is nicely consistent with the values found by @xcite for simulated haloes with masses in the range @xmath134 .",
    "to predict the kinematics of tracers in the stellar halo , we use the density model for the tracers that has already been employed in section  [ sec : trunc ] , i.e. , equation  ( [ eq : rho : trunc ] ) with @xmath67 and @xmath74 , although we set the truncation radius @xmath135kpc , somewhat larger than the value used in figure [ fig : trunc : mw ] .",
    "we then solve the jeans equation  ( [ eq : jeans ] ) for an assumed spatially constant velocity anisotropy @xmath18 , and apply the geometric correction in equation  ( [ eq : sigma : corr ] ) .",
    "this yields a model @xmath85 , which is compared to the @xcite data to compute @xmath65 .",
    "the minimum @xmath136 ( for 10 data points ) is achieved with @xmath137 . as was mentioned above",
    ", this slight radial bias is consistent with observations of halo stars in the solar neighbourhood @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : dischalo ] shows our best - fit @xmath63 profile against the @xcite data , plus another estimate of the stellar - halo velocity - dispersion profile from @xcite .",
    "the latter is also constructed from velocity data for globular clusters , rr  lyrae stars , and dwarf spheroidals , and so is not independent of the @xcite profile ; thus , we have not used it in determining @xmath65 for our models .",
    "however , this alternate profile serves to confirm the overall sense of the @xcite results ( and to emphasise their uncertainty at the largest radii ) .",
    "we have also plotted in figure [ fig : dischalo ] alternate models in which the tracers still have constant @xmath137 but are truncated at @xmath138 or 230kpc .",
    "the bold , dashed curve which declines only gradually towards large radius is the velocity - dispersion profile assuming the tracer density profile to be an untruncated pure power law @xmath70 .",
    "this is the assumption made by @xcite in their modelling , and it clearly has a dramatic  even dominant  influence on the anisotropy profiles they require in order to fit the observed @xmath85 .",
    "comparing figures [ fig : trunc : mw ] and [ fig : dischalo ] , it is clear that in the latter we are able to describe the observed @xmath85 profile with a larger assumed truncation radius for the stellar - halo tracers than in the former , and also that a constant @xmath137 predicts slightly lower velocity dispersions at small radii in our ( disc+halo ) mass model than in the constant-@xmath25 model .",
    "these points simply reflect that the total circular speed given by equations ( [ eq : vcdisc ] ) and ( [ eq : vchalo ] ) decreases monotonically with radius for @xmath139kpc ( which adds to the effect of a truncated tracer density in driving the decline of @xmath63 ) , and in fact is less than 220kms@xmath88 at all radii covered by the @xcite or @xcite data ( so for fixed @xmath29 , a slightly higher @xmath18 is required to give the same normalisation to the tracers @xmath62 , as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ [ eq : sigma : power ] ] ) .",
    "even so , all of the anisotropic models illustrated here fit the data equally well , and thus the tracer velocity - dispersion profile alone _ can not _ be used to distinguish between different ( reasonable ) models for the total mass distribution in the milky way .",
    "conversely , beyond concluding simply that the observed @xmath85 profile is consistent with a tracer density profile that falls steeply at @xmath4kpc , we can not use these kinematics to infer anything more detailed about the behaviour of @xmath10 for the far stellar halo .    nor",
    "can strong constraints be placed on the velocity anisotropy of the tracer population . in the context of a spatially constant @xmath18 , as we have assumed , all that can be said with any confidence is that a slight radial bias ( @xmath140 , depending on the galactic mass model ) is required to explain the amplitude of @xmath63 at @xmath89kpc .",
    "if the assumed form of the total mass distribution deviates significantly from the models with constant or slowly - varying @xmath28 that we have explored , then a variety of @xmath27 behaviour is likely allowed by the data .    clearly , untangling the degeneracies between the total @xmath141 and tracer @xmath10 and @xmath27 , to put quantitative limits on any one profile from knowledge of the others ,",
    "is a daunting task that will require much closer attention to a wider variety of data beyond just @xmath85 .",
    "for example , the models for @xmath28 that we have worked with here are extremely simple and would surely require some modification in detail if we attempted to take accurately into account the many other constraints on the galactic mass distribution .",
    "but more detailed modelling will also have to allow for the fact that the tracers contributing to the @xcite and @xcite velocity - dispersion profiles are very much a ` mixed bag ' : the halo globular clusters , for instance , may not have the same anisotropy profile as the field rr  lyrae and red giants ; and the satellite dwarf spheroidals likely do not follow the same density profile as the stars and globulars . ideally , we need information on _ separate _",
    "@xmath0 , @xmath10 , and @xmath27 profiles for each of the different tracer populations .",
    "current data simply do not provide this .",
    "we have demonstrated in this study that the falling velocity dispersion found by @xcite in the outer stellar halo of the milky way is consistent with a constant ( and reasonable ) velocity anisotropy for the stellar tracers , and either a perfectly flat circular - speed curve ( i.e.  an isothermal total mass distribution ) or a standard cdm dark - matter halo combined with an exponential stellar disc .",
    "by contrast , @xcite argued that their data were inconsistent with @xmath25 and @xmath18 both being strictly constant , and that they required a strongly varying ( and rather unusual ) @xmath27 profile to be made compatible with the common @xcite model for a dark - matter halo . , the stellar disc contributes significantly to the total circular speed out to tens of kpc , and the total @xmath28 differs from that of the dark halo until _ very _ large radii . ]    as we have emphasised , the primary reason for the difference between our conclusions and theirs is that we allow for the tracer density to die out at @xmath142160kpc , close to the milky way s virial radius , whereas @xcite assume that @xmath70 , which is valid for @xmath143kpc , continues to hold for all larger radii .",
    "an incorrect transformation from modelled @xmath12 to observed @xmath85 on the part of @xcite ( see section [ sec : geocorr ] ) has certainly also contributed to the discrepancy , insofar as it affected the @xmath65 values of their detailed model fits .",
    "as we discussed , these data by themselves are insufficient for differention between different total - mass models for the galaxy , nor between different velocity - anisotropy profiles for the tracers .",
    "this is essentially because the measured @xmath0 depends on both of the above ( the well - known degeneracy between velocity anisotropy and mass profile ) and on the tracer s density profile , which is little constrained observationally at @xmath144kpc .",
