    "in three previous papers we have developed a method of measuring galaxy power spectrum with discrete wavelet transform ( dwt ) decomposition , which is an alternative of the fourier power spectrum detection ( fang & feng , 2000 ( paper i ) , yang et al 2001a ( paper ii ) , 2001b ( paper iii ) ) .",
    "the dwt power spectrum estimator is information - loseless , and optimized in the sense that the spatial resolution is adaptive automatically to the scale to be studied .",
    "a test with observed sample of the lcrs galaxies showed that the dwt estimator can give a robust measurement of the power spectrum .    in this paper",
    ", we continue our effort in this direction .",
    "the topic this time is to develop theory and algorithm of redshift distortion in the dwt representation .    in terms of power spectrum measurement ,",
    "the central problem of redshift distortion is to find the mapping between the power spectra in redshift and physical spaces . in our paper ii",
    ", we have already studied this mapping . however , that mapping is directly obtained by a wavelet transform of the mapping of the power spectrum in the fourier representation ( peacock & dodds 1994 ) .",
    "although a fourier mode can be transformed into dwt modes and _ vice versa _ , we should be careful in doing the transform of a second order statistical quantity from the fourier representation into the dwt one .",
    "as we have showed in paper i , the covariance of density contrast in the dwt representation @xmath1 is not equivalent to the fourier counterpart @xmath2 , because the fourier mode is subjected to the central limit theorem , while mode localized in both scale and physical space may not be so .",
    "this is because the dwt mode is characterized by not only the scale , but also the configuration ( or shape ) of the mode .",
    "simply speaking , the variance @xmath1 contains information of both the scale and phase ( shape ) , while @xmath3 does not contain information of phases ( fang & thews 1998 ) .",
    "we have found in paper ii that , the fourier mapping of redshift distortion can be employed for diagonal dwt power spectrum , but not off - diagonal dwt power spectrum .",
    "this is due to the shape(phase)-dependence of dwt modes .",
    "a 3-d fourier mode with wave - vector @xmath4 can be transformed into mode @xmath5 by a coordinate rotation as long as @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , for an isotropic random field , the fourier modes with the same @xmath7 are statistically equivalent . however , the dwt modes do not share the same property",
    ". the length scale of a 3-d wavelet mode with scale index @xmath8 is @xmath9^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath10 is the length scale of the sample .",
    "generally , one can not transform a mode @xmath11 to @xmath12 by a rotation , even if they have the same scale .    as a consequence ,",
    "the redshift distortion in the dwt presentation will be shape - dependent .",
    "for instance , in the fourier representation , the linear redshift distortion factor @xmath13 ( kaiser 1987 ) , where @xmath0 is the so - called redshift distortion parameter , depends only on @xmath14 , i.e. the cosine of the angle between the wavevector @xmath15 and the line - of - sight . while in the dwt representation , the linear redshift distortion factor will depend on not only the scale , but also the shape of dwt modes .",
    "an important application of redshift distortion is to determine the redshift distortion parameter @xmath0 ( e.g. hamilton 1998 ) , which contains valuable information of the cosmological mass density parameter and the bias of galaxies .",
    "the shape - dependence of redshift distortion is very useful for the parameter determination .",
    "we will develop an algorithm of @xmath0 estimation with diagonal and off - diagonal dwt power spectra .",
    "moreover , the dwt representation provides an easy way to study the effect of selection function on the redshift distortion . in the first three papers",
    ", we assumed that the selection function @xmath16 is known .",
    "actually , the  known \" is not necessary . according to the definition",
    ", selection function is an observed galaxy distribution if galaxy clustering is absent .",
    "therefore , for a consistent algorithm of power spectrum , the selection function should be and can be obtained by the galaxy distribution itself .",
    "we will show that in the dwt representation the selection function can be determined by the distribution of galaxies without other assumption .",
    "this algorithm is convenient to estimate the contribution of selection function to redshift distortion .",
    "the paper will be organized as follows .",
    " 2 is a summary of the algorithm of the dwt power spectrum . in  3 , we develop a theory of the redshift distortion with a multiresolution analysis .",
    "the emphases are the real - redshift mapping of diagonal and off - diagonal power spectrum .",
    "we proposed @xmath0-estimators , which are tested by n - body simulation samples of popular dark matter models (  4 and 5 ) .",
    "finally , the conclusions and discussions will be presented in  6 .",
    "the mathematical stuffs with the relevant dwt quantities are given in appendix .",
    "we summarize the algorithm of the dwt power spectrum .",
    "the details can be found in fang & feng ( 2000 ) and yang et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "if the position measurement is perfectly precise , the number density distribution of galaxies can be written as @xmath17\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the total number of galaxies , @xmath19 is position of @xmath20th galaxy , @xmath21 is its weight , and @xmath22 the 3-d dirac @xmath23 function .",
    "@xmath16 is selection function given by the mean number density of galaxies when galaxy clustering is absent , and @xmath24 is the density contrast fluctuation in the underlying matter distribution .    without loss of generality , we enclose the sample in a cubic box with side lengths @xmath25 . in the dwt representation , @xmath26 is decomposed into @xmath27 where , @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 the index @xmath8 stand for 3-d scales @xmath30 , and index @xmath31 for the position of cell @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .    in eq.(3 ) , @xmath35 is called scaling function coefficient ( sfc ) of @xmath26 .",
    "they are given by @xmath36 where we have used equation ( 1 ) in the last step .",
    "the scaling functions @xmath37 play the role of window functions for the cell with volume @xmath38 , and located at position @xmath39 .",
    "therefore , the sfc @xmath35 is the mean of field @xmath26 in the volume @xmath38 at position @xmath39 .",
    "thus , the term @xmath28 of eqs.(2 ) and ( 3 ) actually is the smoothed @xmath28 by window on scale @xmath40 .",
    "the 3-d scaling functions @xmath37 can be constructed by a direct product of 1-d scaling functions , i.e. @xmath41    in eq.(2 ) , @xmath42 are wavelets .",
    "an 1-d wavelet @xmath43 is the modes used to extract the fluctuations of a 1-d field @xmath44 on scale @xmath45 at position @xmath39 .",
    "the 3-d wavelets @xmath42 are given by mixed direct products of 1-d scaling functions @xmath46 and wavelets @xmath47 as follows , @xmath48 accordingly , @xmath49 with @xmath50 describe 2-d projected fluctuations on a slice , and @xmath51 1-d fluctuations along a line .",
    "@xmath52 describes the 3-d fluctuations inside the cell @xmath53 on a scale @xmath54 .",
    "hereafter , we consider the projection of density fluctuations onto the space spanned by @xmath52 only . for simplicity , we ignore the upper index @xmath55 in the notations of @xmath49 and @xmath56 without confusion .",
    "thus , the wavelet function coefficient ( wfc ) @xmath57 of @xmath26 is given by @xmath58 therefore , the wfc @xmath57 is the amplitude of the fluctuations of the field @xmath26 on scale @xmath38 at position @xmath39 .    the functions @xmath37 and @xmath59 form a complete and orthonormal basis in space of functions defined in 3-dimensional coordinate space .",
    "the decomposition of eq.(2 ) is information loseless .",
    "the dwt power spectrum of @xmath24 can be estimated by @xmath60 ^ 2}{n^2({\\bf j , l})}\\right \\rangle   -\\left \\langle \\frac{1}{n({\\bf j , l})}\\right \\rangle,\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the average over ensemble . the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "is the normalized power from @xmath26 , and the second term corrects for the poisson noise .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath62 is the mean selection function in the mode @xmath63 , i.e. , the number density of galaxies in the mode @xmath63 when galaxy clustering is absent .",
    "as has been shown in paper i ( fang & feng 2000 ) , the factor @xmath64 can be absorbed into the weight factor by @xmath65 thus , equation(8 ) yields @xmath66 ^ 2 - \\frac{1}{2^{j_1+j_2+j_3}}\\sum_{l_1=0}^{2^{j_1}-1 } \\sum_{l_2=0}^{2^{j_2}-1}\\sum_{l_3=0}^{2^{j_3}-1 } \\int\\frac{\\psi_{\\bf j , l}^2({\\bf x})}{\\bar{n}({\\bf x } ) } d{\\bf x},\\ ] ] where the wfc @xmath67 is defined as @xmath68      by definition eq.(1 ) , selection function @xmath16 is an observed galaxy distribution if galaxy clustering @xmath69 is absent .",
    "that is , equation ( 1 ) requires to decompose an observed distribution @xmath26 into two parts : the `` background '' @xmath16 , and the fluctuations @xmath24 upon the background .",
    "this decomposition is not easy if the selection function @xmath16 is position - dependent , i.e. it will mix with the fluctuations to be detected . with the dwt analysis ,",
    "one is capable of performing this decomposition by a scale - by - scale analysis .    when we study the fluctuations on a scale @xmath40 , all @xmath70-dependencies of @xmath26 on scales larger than this scale play the role as a background .",
    "thus , in terms of the scale @xmath40 , the background is given by a smooth of @xmath26 on the scale @xmath40 , i.e. it does not contain information of fluctuations on scales equal to or less than @xmath40 .",
    "this background has already be found from equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . because of the orthogonal relation @xmath71 the function @xmath28 does not contain any information of fluctuations of modes @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "thus , to detect the fluctuation power on the scale @xmath40 , the function @xmath28 is recognized as a background field .",
    "one can identify the selection function as @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath74 where the superscript @xmath40 means that this `` selection function '' is only for the scale @xmath40 .    in the plane",
    "parallel approximation , selection function depends on @xmath75 only , i.e. the coordinate in redshift direction . from equation ( 13 ) , the selection function is given by @xmath76 from equation ( 6 ) , the sfc @xmath77 is actually given by an average of @xmath26 over the plane @xmath78 , and decomposition along @xmath75 direction .",
    "using equation ( 14 ) , the wfc @xmath67 is now calculated by @xmath79 which presents a simple algorithm for deriving the selection function from observed galaxy samples .",
    "to test this algorithm , we produce mock galaxy samples using n - body simulation , of which the details will be given in  4 . for simplicity",
    ", the selection effect is applied along one axis ( e.g. , @xmath75 direction ) of 3-dimensional cartesian coordinates under the plane parallel approximation . for the simulation sample in the cubic box with a side length of 256 h@xmath80 mpc , we replicate the sample along @xmath75 direction , and choose the mock galaxies located between 100 - 356 h@xmath80 mpc .",
    "a selection function is given by @xmath81 where @xmath10 is the size of the sample . to be comparable with , for example",

    "1 displays the dwt diagonal power spectrum @xmath85 of particle distributions for three typical models with the selection function eq.(14 ) , in which we take @xmath86 .",
    "it shows that the power spectrum estimator eqs.(10 ) and ( 15 ) can perfectly recover the dwt power spectrum regardless the selection functions ( 16 ) .",
    "this result will keep unchanged if @xmath87 .",
    "it means that @xmath88 gives a proper estimation of selection function if @xmath89 is high enough .",
    "practically , one can find a properly recovered power spectrum by checking whether it is insensitive to @xmath89 .",
    "it should be pointed out that with the developed algorithm the power spectrum eq.(8 ) is normalized scale - by - scale .",
    "the fluctuation amplitudes @xmath90 ( wfcs ) on scale @xmath40 is normalized by @xmath62 or @xmath91 [ eq.(15 ) ] , which contains fluctuations on all scales larger than @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , the normalization factor generally is scale - dependent .",
    "this is different from conventional normalization , which is scale - independent .",

    "however , for non - gaussian field , especially , if the perturbations on different scales are correlated , the small scale fluctuations given by the wfc @xmath90 generally are correlated with large scale fluctuation contained in @xmath62 or @xmath91 . in this case , the power spectrum eq.(8 ) is very different from usual power spectrum which does nt not sensitive to the correlation between perturbations on different scales .",

    "an isotropic statistics plus an axially symmetric violation will result in an axial symmetry . on the other hand , all redshift distortion factors in equation ( 59 ) are no longer axial symmetric , which is due to the modes @xmath40 being not invariant under rotational transformation , but for cyclical permutation . therefore , the symmetry of the dwt redshift distortion results from a cyclical permutation plus an axially symmetric violation .    by virtue of this feature",
