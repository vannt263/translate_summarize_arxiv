    "<S> we point out that the reported deviation in the muon s @xmath1 can be due partially or even entirely to a new physics contribution to the muon s _ electric _ dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the recent @xmath1 measurement provides the most stringent bound on @xmath0 to date . this ambiguity could be definitively resolved by the dedicated search for @xmath0 recently proposed . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider both model - independent and supersymmetric frameworks . under the assumptions of scalar degeneracy , proportionality , and flavor conservation , </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical expectations for @xmath0 in supersymmetry fall just below the proposed sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> however , non - degeneracy can give an order of magnitude enhancement , and lepton flavor violation can lead to @xmath2 , two orders of magnitude above the sensitivity of the @xmath0 experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we present compact expressions for leptonic dipole moments and lepton flavor violating amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> we also derive new limits on the amount of flavor violation allowed and demonstrate that approximations previously used to obtain such limits are highly inaccurate in much of parameter space .    </S>"
