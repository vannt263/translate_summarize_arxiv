    "only one magnetar , the transient 5.5s axp , is known to emit radio waves @xcite , with several unusual characteristics that are not understood .",
    "it is therefore important to identify further examples of this still mystery - ridden class of neutron stars .",

    "its flux , as observed by , , and , has varied by a factor of 7 , and it has the spectral characteristics of an axp . although no x - ray pulsations have been detected from , the upper limit of 14% on its pulsed fraction is larger than that of one known axp , 4u  0142 + 62 . here",

    "the profiles have @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , while the huge asymmetric tail of the 1.4ghz profile is caused by scattering in the ism .",

    "the profiles were aligned by eye . ]",
    "we observed the pulsar on 11 occasions spanning 19 days , detecting it every time .",
    "the pulse profile at 1.4ghz is very broad and asymmetric , dominated by multipath propagation in the ism ( fig .",

    "the calibrated period - averaged pulsed flux density is @xmath19mjy , with daily - averaged fluxes constant within the uncertainties .",
    "however , because the pulse is so scattered at 1.4ghz , about 25% of the received flux is unpulsed , which we measure with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ; ",
    "[ sec : atca ] ) . at higher frequencies",
    "the profile is more symmetric and narrower ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profs ] ) , and the flux density is larger ( @xmath20mjy in our only observation at 6.6ghz ) , suggesting a rising spectrum . in one of two observations at 2.3ghz we saw sudden , major profile variations ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : sp ] ) , and until they are better characterized , spectral indices should be estimated from simultaneous multi - frequency measurements .",

    "we searched for pulsations in these data , but found none to a limit of @xmath23mjy ( accounting for the less sensitive beam used at an offset position ) .",
    "since interstellar scintillation is not expected to modulate the flux of a pulsar with its dm @xcite , these non - detections imply that the pulsar was fainter in 1998 august than in 2007 june by a factor @xmath24 .    at 2s ,",
    "the rotation period of  is substantially smaller than that of any other known magnetar .",
    "nevertheless , its @xmath25 implies a magnetic field solidly in the range of magnetars ( @xmath26 g ) .",
    "the @xmath27@xmath6pc is consistent with the large x - ray - fitted neutral hydrogen column density , @xmath28@xmath11 @xcite , and implies a distance @xmath29kpc according to the free - electron model of @xcite .",
    "a smaller @xmath30kpc for the candidate snr  was suggested by @xcite .",
    "assuming that the two objects are associated , the smaller distance estimate would place the magnetar / snr in or near the crux  scutum spiral arm , while the larger distance would be compatible with a norma spiral arm location .",

    "instead , the @xmath32s broadening observed ( fig .",
    "[ fig : profs ] ) is larger than for any known pulsar ( see * ? ? ?",

    "visibilities were accumulated into 32 phase bins coherently with the pulsar period .",
    "first we observed the flux calibrator 0823500 , and then obtained data for 7hr over a 12hr span , with scans of 20 minutes on the pulsar interleaved with 90s scans on the phase calibrator 1613586 .",
    "the configuration used was , in effect , only sensitive to point sources .",
    "we analyzed the correlated data using standard techniques within miriad .",
    "we detected pulsations from  at both frequencies at a position identical to s to within @xmath36 in each coordinate , greatly reducing the uncertainty ( see table  [ tab : parms ] ) .",
    "the pulsar phase - integrated flux densities measured on this day were @xmath37mjy and @xmath38mjy .",
    "the corresponding spectral index is @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the one @xmath41mjy measurement (   [ sec : parkes ] ) suggests that this rising spectrum may flatten at higher frequencies , but due to the potential for variability , further measurements will be needed to address this question .",
    "we have not detected any flux from the off - pulse phase bins at 2.4ghz , from which we limit any emission from a nebula smaller than the @xmath42 beam size to @xmath43mjy ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "on 2007 june 22 we obtained a 2941s exposure of  with the x - ray telescope in photon counting mode , which provides imaging with @xmath45 half - power diameter resolution and 2.5s time sampling .",
    "the source was detected in the range 18kev with a mean count rate of 0.095s@xmath4 , with a spectrum similar to that from observations @xcite .",
    "neither the counts nor the time resolution were sufficient to detect pulsations .",
    "however , the flux was @xmath46ergs@xmath11s@xmath4 , which is 16 times greater than the minimum seen in 2006 july  august , and 2.4 times greater than the previous highest flux . the bolometric blackbody flux corrected for absorption is @xmath47ergs@xmath11s@xmath4 .",

    "the spin - down luminosity of , @xmath59ergss@xmath4 , exceeds that of any previously known magnetar .",
    "typical values of @xmath55 for axps are @xmath60ergss@xmath4 , while they range from @xmath61ergss@xmath4 for 1e  2259 + 586 @xcite to the historic maximum of @xmath62ergss@xmath4 for sgr  180620 @xcite .",
    "the spin - down luminosity of  is only slightly exceeded by its maximum x - ray luminosity , @xmath63@xmath64ergss@xmath4 , which is one of the discriminators of a magnetar from a rotation - powered pulsar .",
    "it is unlikely that a significant fraction of this x - ray luminosity is powered by rotation ; its distinctive properties are consistent with crustal heating by magnetic field decay as in other axps .",
    "first , the luminosity has varied by a factor of 16 , while rotation - powered pulsars and cooling neutron stars are steady .",
    "second , the composite x - ray spectrum is similar to that of other axps , including a thermal component that even in a low state is fitted by a blackbody of @xmath65kev @xcite , which is hotter by at least a factor of 3 than a cooling neutron star of its same age ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "that  has the shortest @xmath50 and highest @xmath55 among known magnetars is consistent with the hypothesis that they are born with @xmath66s and spin down to their longest observed periods on timescales of @xmath67yr .",
    "however , it does not ease the problem of the narrow period distribution of magnetars @xcite , in particular , why there is a cutoff at long @xmath50 .",
    "the small characteristic age of  may be related to the size of its presumed snr  , which has a diameter of @xmath68pc @xcite .",
    "we first argue that the snr hosts of axps are no older than their pulsar s characteristic age : the two previously confirmed axps that are located in remnants have characteristic age slightly larger than the snr age ( 1e  1841045 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or an order of magnitude larger ( 1e  2259 + 586 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the latter case ,",
    "it is possible that the historic average of @xmath25 was much higher than its present value .",
    "similarly ,  is probably not older than the @xmath69kyr of .",
    "then , at @xmath70kpc , the radius of the snr shell implies an average expansion velocity of 1600kms@xmath4 .",
    "this is small for the free - expansion stage of an snr . assuming instead that the snr is already in the adiabatic ( sedov ) phase , and following @xcite who argued that the explosion energies of axp remnants are no larger than those of ordinary pulsars , we find , for an explosion energy of @xmath71ergs , an ambient density @xmath72g@xmath6 , or @xmath73@xmath6 , which is typical of molecular clouds .",
    "if the distance is 9kpc , then the required density is @xmath74@xmath6 .",
    "these densities are compatible with the expectation that magnetars are born from massive stars that have short lives and are the first ones to explode , in environments that are still dense ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the larger distance , however , requires less extreme conditions than the nearer one .",
    "the location of  in the center of its presumed snr , similar to 1e  2259 + 586 and 1e  1841045 , is an indication that magnetars are not born with greater kick velocity than normal pulsars .",
    "the only direct proper motion measurement of a magnetar ,  with tangential velocity @xmath75kms@xmath4 @xcite , supports this interpretation .",
    "we judge by eye that  is within @xmath76 of the center of the @xmath77 diameter shell of  ( fig .  4 of * ?",
    "* ) , its presumed birth location .",
    "if its true age is equal to or greater than its characteristic age of 1.4kyr , then its proper motion is less than @xmath78yr@xmath4 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath79kms@xmath4 .",
    "two axps ,  and , are now known to emit radio waves , and a comparison of their properties is revealing . both appear to be transient . in the case of",
    ", the radio emission began within 1yr of its only known x - ray outburst @xcite . at its observed peak @xmath80yr after the x - ray outburst , the radio flux density was @xmath81 times the prior upper limit @xcite , but the x - rays have now returned to quiescence , @xmath82 times below their peak flux @xcite , and the radio flux is much diminished as well @xcite . for , we know that in 2007 june its radio flux density is @xmath83 times the upper limit from 1998 august , while the contemporaneous x - ray flux is the highest observed .",
    "the x - ray flux history of  was not as well sampled nor as consistently faint as that of , but it has varied by a factor of 16",
    ".    it may be significant that the two axps detected so far in radio have the smallest periods , 2.0 and 5.5s .",
    "while x - ray emission from magnetars is manifestly not powered by rotation , it is not ruled out that their radio emission is governed by the same polar - cap gap accelerators and death lines as ordinary pulsars .",
    "if coming from open field lines , the width of the radio beam is proportional to @xmath84 , which favors detection of short - period pulsars if all are radio emitters and are randomly aligned . on the other hand , the 6.6ghz pulse from  ( fig .  [",
    "fig : profs ] ) is much wider than almost all profiles of ordinary long - period pulsars , so a different explanation may have to be sought for its pulse width .",
    "if the viewing angle and magnetic inclination angle with respect to the rotation axis are both small , this could explain the broad radio pulse of  and the failure so far to see pulsed x - ray modulation ( assumed to come from surface thermal emission ) .",
    "it is also possible that the wide profile of  is indicative of emission from closed , non - potential field lines in the magnetar model @xcite instead of the narrow open field - line bundle . closed , twisted field lines may span a large range of azimuthal angles near the surface of the neutron star , and models of pair production there yield relativistic @xmath85 that are appropriate for radio emission @xcite . from , there are indications that at least some of the radio emission originates on open field lines @xcite , while some characteristics remain unexplained and could point to either location @xcite .",
    "both pulsars have exhibited sudden changes in radio pulse shape .",
    "the example in figure  [ fig : sp ] is somewhat reminiscent of x - ray bursts from axps including  @xcite , although x - ray bursts were not seen in coincidence with such radio transitions in @xcite .",
    "based on the few observations so far , pulse - shape variations observed from  are less pronounced than in , and its daily - averaged flux density may be steady , unlike the first radio magnetar @xcite .",
    "most striking are the flat or inverted radio spectra of  and  @xcite , which are unique , and clearly distinguishes them from ordinary radio pulsars .    at their peak ,",
    "both magnetars are very luminous young radio pulsars : @xmath86mjykpc@xmath87 , which is larger than the @xmath88 of virtually any ordinary pulsar with @xmath89yr ( see * ? ? ?",
    "if this is a general property , the future may be ( transiently ) bright for further radio detections from known or yet to be identified magnetars .",
