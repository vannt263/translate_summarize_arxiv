    "the goal of this paper is to describe composition - closed equational classes of boolean functions not necessarily containing projections , thereby generalizing post s description of boolean clones .",
    "first we recall the definition of a clone , and then we give an informal overview of the problem that we consider . for formal definitions and more background see section  [ sect preliminaries ] and @xcite .",
    "we define the _ composition _ of an @xmath0-ary function @xmath1 by the @xmath2-ary functions @xmath3 as the @xmath2-ary function @xmath4 given by@xmath5 we say that @xmath6 is the _ outer function _ of the composition , and @xmath7 are the _",
    "inner functions_. a _ clone _ on the set @xmath8 is a class @xmath9 of finitary functions that is closed under composition and contains the _ _",
    "projections__@xmath10 ( here , and in the rest of the paper , @xmath11 , i.e. , we exclude @xmath12 from the set of natural numbers . )",
    "although the above definition of composition is restrictive in the sense that the inner functions must have the same arity , by making use of projections one can see that clones are closed under compositions without restrictions on the arities . for example , let us suppose that @xmath6 is a ternary function in a clone @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are unary , binary , ternary functions in @xmath13 , respectively . if we would like to build the composite function @xmath15 using only compositions of the form ( [ eq comp ]",
    ") , then we could proceed as follows : first construct ternary functions @xmath16 with the help of the projections:@xmath17 and then form the composition @xmath18 .    as we can see from the above example , composing a function with projections",
    "allows us to add dummy variables to the function ( see @xmath19 ) , to permute the variables of the function ( see @xmath20 ) and to identify variables of the function ( see @xmath21 ) .",
    "function classes closed under the latter three operations are called _ equational classes _ , since they can be defined by functional equations ( see subsection  [ subsect equational classes ] ) .",
    "the above discussion shows that every clone is an equational class , but , as we shall see in subsection  [ subsect equational classes ] , there are equational classes that are not clones .",
    "all clones on a given finite base set @xmath8 form an algebraic lattice . this _ clone lattice _ has continuum cardinality if @xmath22 ( see @xcite ) , and it seems to be a very hard problem to describe its structure . the case @xmath23 , i.e. , the case of boolean functions was settled by e.  l.  post , who described all clones of boolean functions in @xcite .",
    "there are countably many such clones , and their lattice is known as the post lattice ( see figure  [ fig post ] ) .",
    "we will generalize the notion of a clone by considering function classes that are closed under composition ( in the sense of ( [ eq comp ] ) ) but do not necessarily contain the projections .",
    "however , we would like to be able to identify and permute variables and introduce dummy variables , therefore we only consider composition - closed equational classes .",
    "these classes form a complete lattice that contains the clone lattice as the principal filter generated by the clone of projections ( see figure  [ fig biglattice ] ) .",
    "the main result of this paper is a description of this lattice over a two - element base set .",
    "although the clone lattice is countable in this case , we will see that the lattice of composition - closed equational classes of boolean functions is uncountable .",
    "composition - closed equational classes subsume iterative algebras as well .",
    "a function class @xmath24 is an _ iterative algebra _ if @xmath25 , whenever @xmath26 and @xmath27for @xmath28 . clearly , every iterative algebra is a composition - closed equational class , and an iterative algebra is a clone iff it contains the projections .",
    "the difference between composition - closed equational classes and iterative algebras can be best understood by visualizing compositions as trees . as an example , let us consider the following two compositions :    if @xmath24 is an iterative algebra and @xmath29 , then both @xmath8 and @xmath30 must belong to @xmath24 . however",
    ", if @xmath24 is only assumed to be a composition - closed equational class , then @xmath8 does not necessarily belong to @xmath24 , as it involves the composition @xmath31 , where one inner function is a projection .",
    "this problem does not arise with @xmath30 , hence @xmath32 is guaranteed , whenever @xmath24 is a composition - closed equational class .    in general",
    ", we can say that composition - closed equational classes are closed under compositions whose tree satisfies the following condition : for any internal node , either all or none of its children are leaves . as an exercise in handling such compositions , we invite the reader to verify the following fact : the clone generated by the addition operation of a field ( or , more generally , of any additive commutative semigroup ) consists of functions of the form @xmath33",
    "the iterative algebra generated by addition contains only those such functions where @xmath35 , while the composition - closed equational class generated by addition contains only those where @xmath36 is even .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect preliminaries ] we present the necessary background on equational classes , boolean clones , and galois connections between functions and relations . in section",
    "[ sect idempotents vs clones ] we make some basic observations about composition - closed equational classes of boolean functions , and we outline a strategy for constructing all of them . in section [",
    "sect easy ] we carry out this strategy for the easy cases , and then we deal with the harder cases in sections [ sect w_infty ] and [ sect w_k ] . finally , in section [ sect concluding ] we put together all the information we found to get a picture about the lattice of composition - closed equational classes of boolean functions .",
    "let @xmath6 and @xmath37 be operations on a set @xmath8 of arity @xmath0 and @xmath38 , respectively . if there exists a map @xmath39",
    "such that@xmath40 then we say that @xmath37 is a _ subfunction _ ( or identification minor or simple variable substitution ) of @xmath6 , and we denote this fact by @xmath41 . if @xmath42 is bijective , then @xmath37 is obtained from @xmath6 by permuting variables ; if @xmath42 is not injective , then @xmath37 is obtained from @xmath6 by identifying variables ; if @xmath42 is not surjective , then @xmath37 is obtained from @xmath6 by introducing inessential ( dummy ) variables .",
    "the subfunction relation gives rise to a quasiorder on the set of all finitary functions on @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding _ equivalence _ is defined by @xmath43 and @xmath41 , and it is clear that @xmath6 and @xmath37 are equivalent iff they differ only in inessential variables and/or in the order of their variables .",
    "we will not distinguish between equivalent functions in the sequel .",
    "for example , we will denote the set of all constant zero functions ( for any @xmath44 ) simply by @xmath45 , and @xmath46 will stand for the set of all projections , as these are the functions equivalent to the identity function .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the class of all  boolean functions , i.e. , the class of finitary operations on @xmath48 .",
    "the subfunction relation induces naturally a partial order on @xmath49 ; the bottom of this poset is shown in figure  [ fig subf ] .",
    "we can see ( and it is easy to prove ) that it has four connected components , namely @xmath50 , where@xmath51 let us observe that @xmath52 is nothing else but the clone of idempotent functions . for an arbitrary function class @xmath24 , we will abbreviate @xmath53 by @xmath54 , and we will later use the following ( hopefully intuitive ) notation as well:@xmath55    [ ptb ]    subf.eps    the minimal elements of @xmath56 are the unary functions : @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( negation ) . on the next level",
    "we can see the binary operations @xmath59 ( addition modulo @xmath60 ) , @xmath61 ( implication ) , @xmath62 ( disjunction ) , @xmath63 ( conjunction ) and the ternary functions @xmath64 ( majority operation ) , @xmath38 ( minority operation ) , @xmath65 ( @xmath66-minority operation , see @xcite ) together with their negations .",
    "here negation is taken from outside , e.g. , @xmath67 is a shorthand notation for the function @xmath68 .",
    "a class @xmath24 of operations on a set @xmath8 is an _ equational class _ if it is an order ideal in the subfunction quasiorder , i.e. , if @xmath69 and @xmath41 imply @xmath70 .",
    "the denomination is explained by the fact that these are exactly the classes that can be defined by functional equations @xcite .",
    "clearly every clone is an equational class , but there are other equational classes as well ; a natural example is the class of antimonotone ( order reversing ) boolean functions , which can be defined by the functional equation @xmath71 .",
    "another example is the class @xmath72 ( see subsection  [ subsect subfunctions ] ) , which can be defined by the equation @xmath73 .",
    "equational classes can be characterized by relational constraints as well ; we will discuss this in more detail in subsection  [ subsect relational constarints ] .",
    "the equational classes on a given set @xmath8 form a lattice @xmath74 with intersection and union as the lattice operations .",

    "the usual notation for the set of idempotents of a semigroup @xmath86 is @xmath87 , but in our case this would lead to the somewhat awkward notation @xmath88 , therefore we will simply write @xmath89 for the set of composition - closed equational classes over @xmath90 .",
    "clearly @xmath89 is closed under arbitrary intersections ( we allow the empty class ) , hence it is a complete lattice .",
