    "[ [ section ] ]    living cells possess multiple trafficking pathways , which have in common , a regulated flux of cargo molecules , such as proteins and lipids , moving through and processed within , organized compartments or organelles .",
    "for instance , the _ secretory pathway _ consists of molecules that move from the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) to the cell surface via an organelle system called the golgi apparatus @xcite .",
    "the golgi apparatus itself consists of distinct sub - compartments known as cisternae .",
    "proteins and lipids arrive from the er , enter through one face of the golgi and undergo several chemical reactions ( processing ) ; the modified products then leave through the other face to mainly target the cell surface .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    there has been much discussion about what drives the flux of molecules through the golgi @xcite .",
    "the _ vesicular transport model _ envisages that the cisternae are stable structures with fixed enzymatic composition .",
    "molecules shuttle from one cisterna to the next in small sacs called vesicles , and get chemically modified by the resident enzymes .",
    "cisternal maturation model _",
    ", on the other hand , considers the cisternae to be transient structures that are formed by fusion of incoming vesicles . in this model , it is the cisternae that progress through the golgi apparatus , carrying the biomolecules with them .",
    "specific enzymes get attached to a cisterna in different stages of its progression , and modify its contents .",
    "the final cisterna eventually breaks up , releasing processed biomolecules .",
    "independent studies on a variety of cells provide evidence for both these possibilities @xcite .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    not only the cargo molecules , but indeed the molecules that form the golgi organelle themselves , must also be trafficked along the same route and by the same driving forces .",
    "this invites the following question : how does the golgi organelle form in the first place , i.e. , how does one obtain stable structures ( cisternae ) given the rules of molecular trafficking , which broadly , may be described as : ( i ) localised injection of ` particles ' , i.e. of the vesicles containing unprocessed biomolecules ( ii ) transformation of particles from one species to the other , i.e. chemical processing of the biomolecules by enzymes ( iii ) transport of particles either by chipping ( breaking off ) of a single particle ( corresponding to vesicle movement ) or through movement of bigger aggregates ( corresponding to cisternal progression ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to construct a statistical model incorporating these elementary processes , and use this to quantitatively address questions of structure formation and the nature of the states at long times .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    with this motivation , we define the following multi - species model . particles of species a are injected into a one - dimensional ( 1d ) lattice at one boundary .",
    "particles of _ different _ species b , c ... ( or more generally , of all types a , b , c etc . )",
    "leave from the other boundary .",
    "this happens by allowing a particles to convert to b particles ( and vice versa ) , b particles to c and so on .",
    "there is no restriction on the number of particles of any species a site can hold .",
    "the hopping of particles from one site to another can either occur collectively via movement of the whole stack or one at a time by chipping of a single particle .",
    "chipping refers to a _",
    "particle breaking off from a stack and hopping to a neighbouring site",
    ". the hopping probability may be the same to the left and right ( diffusive ) or different ( driven diffusive , due to an existing chemical or electrical gradient ) .",
    "when a particle ( or a collection of particles ) hops on to a stack , it merges with the particles already resident on that site .",
    "thus , stacks constantly gain and lose particles .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    this is a generalization of a well studied model of aggregation and chipping @xcite .",
    "earlier studies dealt with a closed system , with a single species of particle .",
    "the present generalization deals with an open system , with injection of particles at one end , and interconversion from one species of particle to another .",
    "interestingly , we find that new sorts of phases can arise in some limits .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    the parameter space is large .",
    "thus , it is useful to begin with the study of the ` chipping only ' model , where there is no movement of stacks as a whole . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we will study the model in this limit , with chipping and interconversion rates taken to be constants , independent of the number of a or b or c ... particles on the site . with this assumption of constant rates",
    ", we find that for some rates , the system fails to achieve steady state in the sense that unbounded growth of mass occurs .",
    "interestingly , even in these growing states , the particle currents at each site are stationary ( time independent ) after sufficiently long times .",
    "the indefinitely growing average mass at a given site arises simply because the particle currents , though stationary , are not balanced at that site @xcite .",
    "thus , we call such a state quasi - stationary .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    although we have defined the model for an arbitrary number of species , from now on we will focus primarily on the two - species model .",
    "the multi - species model is a simple generalization of the two - species case and shows qualitatively similar behaviour , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:3species ] .",
    "[ [ section-7 ] ]    the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "section [ sec : modelandresults ] defines the model precisely , highlights some connections with other models , and briefly discusses the main results of the paper . in sec .",

    "we briefly discuss the generalization of the model to three species .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] contains a discussion of some issues and extensions .",
    "the model is defined on a 1d lattice . at any time @xmath0 ,",
    "a lattice site @xmath1 has @xmath2 particles of type @xmath3 and @xmath4 particles of type @xmath5 .",
    "we start with an empty lattice with @xmath6 sites at @xmath7 . at each instant",
    ", a site @xmath1 is chosen at random and one of the following moves ( illustrated in fig .",
    "[ model_schematic ] ) occurs in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath8 :    1 .",
    "injection : if the site picked is site 1 , then an a particle is injected into it from the left boundary with probability @xmath9 : @xmath10 2 .",
    "interconversion : with probability @xmath11 , one of the a particles residing on the selected site converts to type b : if @xmath12 , then @xmath13 and @xmath14 . with probability @xmath15 one of the b particles",
    "residing on the site converts to type a : if @xmath16 then @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "3 .   chipping : with probability @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , one of the a particles chips off the site and hops to the right ( left ) neighbouring site , thereby decreasing the mass of a on the site by 1 and increasing the mass of a on the neighbouring site by 1 ; if @xmath12 then @xmath13 and @xmath21 .",
    "with probability @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , one of the b particles chips off the site and hops to the right ( left ) : if @xmath16 then @xmath17 , @xmath24 4 .",
    "stack movement : with probability @xmath25 ( or @xmath26 ) , the entire mass ( i.e. all a and b particles together ) present at the site hops to the right ( left ) neighbouring site : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 .    at the last site",
    "an a ( b ) particle can hop out of the system at a rate @xmath31 , i.e. with the same hopping rate as in the bulk .",
    "once particles hop rightwards from the last site @xmath6 , they can not return to the system .",
    "thus , site @xmath32 acts as a sink .",
    "[ [ section-8 ] ]    in general , the drive i.e. the asymmetry in the rates of the three hopping processes  hopping of stacks , hopping of a particles after chipping and hopping of b particles after chipping , can be different .",
    "however , for simplicity , we will take the asymmetry to be the same for all three processes , i.e. @xmath33",
    ". then we can parametrize the rates as follows : @xmath34 , @xmath35 ; @xmath36 , @xmath37 ; @xmath38 , @xmath39 . here , @xmath40 is the measure of the asymmetry in hopping and takes on values between 0 and 1 .",
    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    the moves ( i ) to ( iv ) above define a general model in which particles can move via both stack movement and chipping .",
    "however , as indicated in section [ sec : intro ] , in this paper we will analyse the model in the absence of stack movement i.e. in the limit @xmath41 .",
    "[ [ section-10 ] ]    several features of our model , including boundary effects , mass movement and coalescence , and two - species coupling have been studied separately in a number of different contexts .",
    "macroscopic aggregates are known to form in models such as the the zero range process ( zrp ) @xcite and the aggregation - chipping model @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the closed system in steady state can enter a condensate phase in which a finite fraction of the total mass resides on a single site .",
    "a quasi - stationary state characterised by growth of total mass in the system occurs in aggregation models such as the takayasu model @xcite in which particles are injected at every site .",
    "the in - out model @xcite , which extends the takayasu model to allow for evaporation of unit masses , exhibits a phase transition from a growing state to a steady state .",
    "such a phase transition is also seen in our model",
    ". however , the phases in our model are not spatially uniform as injection occurs only at the boundary .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    open boundaries with injection can induce interesting features such as boundary - driven phase transitions in the asymmetric simple exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite . in the zrp with open boundaries @xcite , steady state , in the sense of constant average mass ,",
    "is not reached for strong boundary injection ; indefinitely growing aggregates may form on one or both boundaries , while bulk sites attain steady state or show slower growth , depending on the injection , hopping rates , and asymmetry .",
    "our model , in which injection takes place at the boundary , also shows growing phases ; somewhat counter intuitively , a steady state with constant mass is reached close to the boundary , while there is unbounded growth of the mass in the bulk .",
    "[ [ section-12 ] ]    coupling between different species of particle may or may not involve interconversion .",
    "for example , in the two - species zrp @xcite , condensates of one or both species may form above critical densities but the number of particles of each species in the system does not change .",
    "new effects are seen when interconversion ( or more generally , non - conservation of particle number ) occurs .",
    "multi - species models that allow for inter - conversion have been studied earlier in the context of transport in single @xcite and multiple @xcite channels@xcite .",
    "these models differ from the present work in that they restrict the occupancy to at most one particle per site in each channel . generically in an open boundary channel ,",
    "if the number of particles is not conserved in the bulk ( e.g. if switching between channels or deposition and evaporation occurs ) , then for low switching rates , the system may develop a localised shock separating low density and high density regions in one of the channels @xcite .",
    "our model too shows co - existence of two phases of one species ( a steady phase and a growing phase ) in different spatial regions separated by a domain wall with a tunable location .",
    "our main results may be summarised as follows : + the model is parametrized by the rates @xmath42 and the asymmetry parameter @xmath40 , where @xmath43 corresponds to symmetric and @xmath44 to fully asymmetric rightward hopping . in different regions of parameter space , different kinds of behaviour are seen :    1 .",
    "for some values of parameters , the system exists in a steady phase .",
    "occupation probabilities of a and b at a site @xmath1 , i.e. the probability that the site has at least one a ( b ) particle are defined as @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the probability of finding @xmath47 a particles and @xmath48 b particles on site @xmath1 between time @xmath0 and @xmath49 . in the steady phase , @xmath50 and @xmath51 at each site ,",

    "less than 1_. the total mass in the system ( and on each site ) also reaches a finite time - independent value .",
    "2 .   for other values of parameters ,",
    "the system exists in a quasi - stationary state characterised by stationary ( time - independent ) currents but _ non - stationary i.e. indefinitely growing total mass_. this happens even in a finite system .",
    "we will refer to unbounded growth of mass as _ formation of pile - ups_. more precisely , if the average a ( b ) mass at a site grows indefinitely , we refer to this as an a ( b ) pile - up at the site . at the site with an a ( b ) pile - up",
    ", the mean occupancy @xmath52 approaches @xmath53 at long times ( see sec . [",
    "sec : first_site ] ) .",
    "this may be treated as a functional definition of a pile - up .",
    "a pile - up is to be distinguished from a condensate of the sort found in the zero range process ( zrp ) @xcite : a condensate at a site contains a finite fraction of the total number of particles in the system but the condensate mass does not grow in time .",
    "3 .   in the growing phase ,",
    "a system may have pile - ups of a , of b or of both species .",
    "for the situation with injection of only a particles , as studied in this paper , an a pile - up can be found only on site 1 ( except in the special case @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) , i.e. it is a boundary phenomenon .",
    "b pile - ups , on the other hand , are found in the bulk . in a phase with b pile - ups ,",
    "an interesting situation can occur where the lattice has a _ region in steady state ( with finite mean mass ) co - existing with a region of b pile - ups ( where the mean mass grows indefinitely)_. for fully asymmetric hopping , the region close to the left boundary is in steady state while pile - ups occur in the entire region to the right ( shown schematically in fig [ schematic_asym ] ) .",
    "for the symmetric or partially asymmetric case , there are two regions in steady state close to either boundary , with a region of b pile - ups between these ( fig .",
    "[ schematic_sym ] ) .    in the rest of the paper",
    ", we will adopt the following terminology . if the average mass of both a and b reaches a finite time - independent value , we will refer to the system as being in a steady phase .",
    "if one region of the system attains constant average mass and another region shows unbounded growth , we will refer to the two regions as a region in steady state and a region with pile - ups respectively .",
    "the system as a whole will be referred to as being in a growing phase .",
    "[ [ section-13 ] ]    steady and growing phases can also be distinguished by the spatial profile of the currents .",
    "let @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 denote respectively the net a particle current , the b particle current and the total particle current in the @xmath1th bond of the lattice i.e. from site @xmath1 to @xmath59 . figs . [ j(x)steady ] and [ j(x)growing ] show schematically how , for @xmath44 , these three currents vary across the lattice in a steady phase and a growing phase ( with b pile - ups ) respectively . in the steady phase , although @xmath60 and @xmath61 vary with the distance from the origin @xmath62 , they do so in such a way that the total particle current @xmath63 remains constant across the lattice . in contrast , in the growing phase , the _ total particle current @xmath63 also varies with @xmath62 _ in the pile - up region .",
    "in fact , @xmath64 must be greater than @xmath65 for a pile - up to exist at site @xmath1 , implying that @xmath63 decreases with @xmath1 ( or @xmath62 ) in a pile - up region .    ) , the occupation probability profiles @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( dashed lines ) are flat , being @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively . when @xmath70 , @xmath71 , there is a net interconversion from a to b at each site , pushing @xmath72 down from the value @xmath66 and pushing up @xmath73 from the value @xmath67 . here",

    "for simplicity , let us consider purely rightward hopping ( @xmath44 ) in a system of size @xmath6 . in the absence of interconversion , the particle current @xmath60 is the same in each bond , and so is @xmath61 .",
    "thus , @xmath72 and @xmath73 are constant across the lattice , being @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively ( dotted lines in fig . [ s(x ) ] ) .",

    "[ s(x ) ] ) in the following way .",
    "the particle current into site 1 ( @xmath74 ) is entirely of type a. at site 1 , some of the a particles convert to type b , resulting in a small probability that site 1 also has b particles .",
    "hence , @xmath75 is different in composition , having a small b component as well . at site 2",
    ", there is still a much larger concentration of a particles than b particles , and hence a net conversion of a to b particles .",
    "thus , the composition of @xmath76 shifts further towards b. this process continues until we reach a site at which there is _ no net conversion_. beyond this site @xmath60 and @xmath61 do not change with @xmath62 . if interconversions are faster than hopping ( i.e. @xmath77 ) , then at a given site , the relative amounts of a and b can alter significantly through interconversion before hopping occurs . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath60 and @xmath61 change sharply over a few sites and reach their asymptotic values very close to the left boundary . in the other limit ( @xmath78 ) , @xmath60 and @xmath61 vary slowly over a large part of the lattice . in particular , if @xmath79 and @xmath80 are not @xmath81 but @xmath82 , then the spatial variation in @xmath60 and @xmath61 becomes a bulk rather than boundary effect .",
    "[ [ section-15 ] ]    the right boundary is an absorbing boundary .",
    "the degree of asymmetry in the hopping determines how far into the lattice the effect of the absorbing boundary condition propagates .",
    "for fully asymmetric dynamics ( @xmath44 ) , the right boundary has no effect on any other site while for @xmath40 slightly less than 1 , the effect extends only into a very small region of the lattice close to the boundary .",
    "for @xmath43 , the information about the right boundary propagates into the entire lattice .",
    "thus , the asymmetry in hopping rates and the rate of interconversion relative to the rate of hopping together determine how @xmath60 and @xmath61 or @xmath72 and @xmath73 vary across the lattice .",
    "[ [ section-16 ] ]    for fully asymmetric ( rightward ) hopping ( @xmath44 ) , a site is not affected by any sites to the right of it .",
    "thus , the first site can be analysed independently of the rest of the lattice ; this analysis yields considerable insight into the full problem .",
    "we find four possible behaviours : steady state ; pile - up of a but not b ; pile - up of b but not a ; pile - ups of both a and b.    the master equation for the probability distribution @xmath83 ( as defined in section [ sec : results ] ) at the first site can be written as follows : +    [ eqn : mastereqsite1 ] + for @xmath84 and @xmath85 @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89     + to understand the behaviour of the system , we do not solve the master equation but work with the time - evolution equations for @xmath90 and @xmath91 :    [ eqn : currenteqsite1 ]    @xmath92    @xmath93    here @xmath94 and @xmath91 denote the average masses of a and b respectively on site 1 averaged over time histories and @xmath72 and @xmath73 the occupation probabilities of a and b ( defined in eq . ) ; all of these are functions of time .",
    "evidently , eq . is just a continuity equation for the average masses .",
    "[ [ section-17 ] ]    the time - evolution of the first site can also be mapped to a random walk in two dimensions .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) space here is the @xmath95 space .",
    "the random walk starts at the origin at @xmath7 , moves in both positive and negative directions along the @xmath47 axis ( with rates @xmath96 and @xmath97 respectively ) but moves only in the negative direction along the @xmath48 axis ( with a rate @xmath98 ) as there is no injection of b particles .",
    "diagonal moves , corresponding to interconversion , are also allowed _ but only in the direction of increasing @xmath47 and decreasing @xmath48 or vice versa_. the @xmath47 and @xmath48 axes are reflecting boundaries . a possible random walk , with all allowed moves in @xmath95 space ,",
    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ randomwalk ] .",
    "clearly , the random walk can not be decomposed into independent walks along the @xmath47 and @xmath48 axes because of the diagonal moves .",
    "[ [ section-18 ] ]    the random walk picture is useful in the following way . to begin with ,",

    "this walk has a drift velocity @xmath99 and a diffusion constant @xmath100 .",
    "after a length @xmath101 , drift becomes more important than diffusion . if @xmath102 , then beyond this length , the mean displacement will grow linearly with time , while if @xmath103 , the mean displacement reaches a constant value @xmath101 . if @xmath104 , then the motion is always diffusive , and the mean displacement grows as @xmath105 .",
    "the 2-d walk is more complicated because motion along @xmath47 and @xmath48 axes is coupled due to the diagonal moves ( corresponding to interconversion ) .",
    "the diagonal moves effectively make @xmath99 and @xmath100 in the @xmath47 direction dependent on the average displacement along the @xmath48 direction .",
    "if the effective @xmath99 in the @xmath47 direction is greater than or equal to zero , then we get a pile - up of a on the first site ( with @xmath104 implying @xmath106 growth of the pile - up and @xmath102 , growth that is linear in time ) . also , as expected from the theory of random walks",
    ", the fluctuation about the mean mass , i.e. @xmath107 grows as @xmath105 ( for @xmath108 ) . if @xmath103 , then the mean mass of a and the mean deviation in mass of a reach time independent values . in terms of the occupation probability ,",
    "if @xmath109 , then @xmath47 must be finite and if @xmath110 , @xmath47 is infinite at long times ( i.e. pile - ups occur ) . to see this , note that the return from @xmath111 to @xmath112 requires @xmath113 steps , implying that @xmath114 falls as @xmath115 , which is non - vanishing only for finite @xmath113 .",
    "so , if @xmath116 is less than 1 at long times , @xmath117 must be finite ; if @xmath72 is equal to 1 at long times , @xmath117 is infinite .",
    "[ [ section-19 ] ]    from the above discussion it is clear that depending on the rates , the effective @xmath99 in either direction ( i.e. along @xmath47 and @xmath48 axes ) can be negative or non - negative , resulting in four possibilities altogether .",

    "<S> it is found that , depending on the rates of various processes and the asymmetry in the hopping , the system may exist either in a steady phase , in which the average mass at each site attains a time - independent value , or in a `` growing '' phase , in which the total mass grows indefinitely in time , even in a finite system . </S>",
