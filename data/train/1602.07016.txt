    "we can therefore write @xmath126 moreover , as discussed in the main text , the range of values that @xmath85 can have is bounded by the extreme values of @xmath95 .",
    "thus , given @xmath93 , it can be verified for a proposed protocol @xmath84 that the equation above does not hold for any @xmath127 and @xmath128 for which @xmath129 and any @xmath118 in the range @xmath130 note that if @xmath131 for some constants @xmath97 and @xmath98 , as in the example in the main text , and furthermore @xmath132 undergoes only a single oscillation in each period , then eq.([eq : edot_ratio ] ) never holds for any finite @xmath86 .",
    "in this section we explain the transformation from @xmath133 to @xmath84 .",
    "we start with the equation : @xmath134 for any re - parametrization @xmath69 , the equation for @xmath135 is : @xmath136 where @xmath137 and @xmath138 , as in the main text . choosing @xmath69 such that @xmath139 for some constant @xmath140 , would cancel the @xmath141 dependence in the equation for @xmath81 .",
    "therefore , we choose @xmath142 this specific choice of @xmath140 makes @xmath73 , namely when @xmath32 varies from @xmath143 to @xmath144 both @xmath74 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 complete a period , and hence @xmath147 traces exactly the same curve as @xmath31 . the price for",
    "this choice is rescaling of @xmath3 : the equation for @xmath81 becomes : @xmath148 where @xmath149",
    "to show that in the brownian heat engine model discussed in the main text the phase difference between @xmath118 and @xmath132 is the only reason for the decrease in the power , let us first express both @xmath85 and @xmath150 as a fourier series : @xmath151 and @xmath152 . in the fourier basis , the power can be expressed as @xmath153 from this equation it is evident that the power depends on @xmath3 in three distinct ways : ( i ) the _ phase difference _ between @xmath82 and @xmath118 .",
    "note that the ` drift ' of @xmath85 to the left , discussed in the main text , changes exactly this phase difference ; ( ii ) besides the phases @xmath154 , there is additional @xmath3 dependence in the term @xmath155 .",
    "the last factor is ( iii ) the _ spectral overlap _ between @xmath132 and @xmath118  even if @xmath156 is very large for some given @xmath157 , it will not contribute to the power if @xmath158 , namely the spectral overlap between them is zero .",
    "the above three factors are quite general and follows from the definition of the power .",
    "let us next consider the specific model described in the main text .",
    "first , we note that in this case the transformation between @xmath159 and @xmath118 is linear and time invariant , therefore a frequency shift is impossible and the spectral overlap does not changes with @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , the amplitudes @xmath155 can be exactly expressed by taking the fourier series of eq.([eq : w_vs_r ] ) : @xmath160 note that all the amplitudes @xmath155 are monotonically decreasing as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "thus , decreasing @xmath3 necessarily increases the amplitudes of all the fourier coefficients , hence the changes in amplitudes ( which shrinks the width in the @xmath19 direction ) can not explain the power decreasing .",
    "the only reason that the power can decreases with decreasing @xmath3 is the phase difference between @xmath118 and @xmath132 , which deforms the shape of the curve in the @xmath28 $ ] state space .",
    "in the main text we analyzed the brownian particle in a harmonic potential model for a heat engine . another simple model for heat engines which is commonly used",
    "@xcite is the markovian two level system .",
    "this engine is made of two states ( commonly referred to as `` levels '' ) in which the system can be at any moment .",
    "the energy difference between these levels is denoted by @xmath161 and it is periodic in time . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the lower level s energy is fixed in time at @xmath162 , and the upper level s energy is time dependent .",
    "the probability to be in the @xmath63 s level , denoted by @xmath163 , varies according to the master equation , @xmath164 in the master equation , @xmath165 is the rate transition matrix , which can be parametrized by @xmath166 where @xmath167 can be an arbitrary function .",
    "this parametrization is physically motivated by the generalized arrhenius form .",
    "for a two level system , conservation of probability implies @xmath168 , hence we denote the probability to be in the upper state simply as @xmath169 .",
    "the probability to be in the lower level is hence @xmath170 .",
    "substituting eq.([eq : arrhenius ] ) in the master equation gives @xmath171 the infinitesimal heat flow from the bath to the system is given by @xmath172 and the work and efficiency can be interpreted , as in the main text , as areas in the @xmath173 $ ] state space .",
    "following the same steps explained in the main text , we first change to a dimensionless time units , @xmath174 , to get @xmath175 in this case , as in the model described in the main text , we can not vary any of the two control parameters @xmath176 or @xmath116 without affecting the periodic solution of @xmath177 .",
    "we therefore change the time parametrization to @xmath178 the equation for @xmath179 is given by @xmath180 = \\hat \\tau \\left(\\bar p(s)-\\bar \\pi(s)\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we defined @xmath181 the above equation is exactly analogous to eq.(6 ) in the main text , where @xmath173 $ ] is the state space and @xmath182 $ ] is the new control space .",
    "together with the interpretation of the work and efficiency as areas , the rest of the results can be applied equally well to this model .",
    "to prove that no protocol in the brownian particle in harmonics potential heat engine model can attain exactly the carnot efficiency with non - zero power , namely at finite time , we first show that if a protocol achieve exactly the carnot efficiency , then in a complete cycle heat is exchanged with only two baths : the coldest and hottest one . in other words , while it might be possible that in a cycle with the carnot efficiency heat is exchanged with many baths at various temperatures , the net heat exchanged in a complete cycle is zero for all the baths , except the one at the hottest and coldest temperatures . to show this , consider a heat engine which interacts with three heat baths , at temperatures @xmath183 .",
    "let us denote the total heat exchange with these baths by @xmath184 , @xmath185 ( which might be either positive or negative ) , and @xmath186 respectively .",
    "the extracted work is given by @xmath187 .",
    "first , consider the case in which @xmath188 .",
    "the efficiency in this case is given by @xmath189 but the total entropy production in a cycle is non - negative .",
    "as there is no net entropy production in the system itself after completing a cycle when it is in the periodic state , the total entropy production is given by @xmath190 , thus @xmath191 since @xmath192 and both @xmath193 and @xmath194 are positive , the efficiency is necessarily smaller then the carnot efficiency .        to show that no piecewise continuous protocol can attain exactly the carnot efficiency in this model",
    ", we will next show by contradiction that if such a protocol exist , then there exist another protocol , with an even larger efficiency .",
    "this would clearly violate the second law ( which is built into the model ) , since the efficiency of this other protocol is larger then the carnot efficiency .",
    "assume that there exist a protocol , @xmath114 that attains exactly the carnot efficiency with non - zero power at finite time @xmath3 .",
    "then , by the argument given above , there is only total heat exchange with two baths , hence @xmath200 where @xmath186 and @xmath184 for it to be an engine .",
    "moreover , it must interact for some finite time with the coldest bath , otherwise it will not exchange heat with the coldest bath or with any bath other then the hottest bath , so by the second law its power must be zero .",
    "let us denote one of the intervals in which the engine is in contact with the coldest bath by @xmath201 .",
    "in what follows , we shows that it is possible to deform only the part of the protocol in which it touches the cold bath , namely in the interval @xmath201 , and increase @xmath202 ( and hence the efficiency ) without changing the temperature or the rest of the protocol . to this end",
    "we use @xmath203 where for simplicity we use the notation @xmath204 .",
    "the protocol deformation , denoted by @xmath205 , changes also @xmath19 by @xmath206 , but must not change @xmath207 , to avoid changing the carnot efficiency .",
    "therefore , the deformation must be constrained by : @xmath208 additional restriction on the deformation comes from the fact that @xmath19 is a solution of an o.d.e .",
    ", thus it must be continues ( but not necessarily differentiable ) , namely @xmath209 .    in principle",
    ", the deformation is defined by @xmath210 , and the deformation @xmath206 can be calculated from the equation above",
    ". however , the constraint @xmath209 makes it simpler to define the deformation in terms of @xmath206 , and solve for @xmath205 .",
    "let us choose the variation fo the form @xmath211 for some function @xmath212 ( and infinitesimal @xmath213 ) .",
    "then from the above equation : @xmath214 but on the other hand @xmath215 equating these two equation and solving for @xmath141 , one finds that @xmath216    next , let us consider the change in the heat exchange with the cold bath : @xmath217 hence @xmath218 using the results above we can write : @xmath219 can we choose a deformation @xmath212 that will make @xmath220 , hence increasing the efficiency ? to do this we need to choose @xmath221 such that the above integral is positive , and such that @xmath222 and @xmath223 .",
    "this can be done as follows : we choose @xmath221 to be zero everywhere , except for a very small section , of length @xmath224 , somewhere at a location between @xmath225 and @xmath128 such that in this interval @xmath65 and @xmath226 are both continuous .",
    "@xmath224 is chosen to be short enough such that in this interval both @xmath227 and @xmath228 are constant to a good approximation , and such that @xmath229 : this is always possible since @xmath230 by definition ( it is a variance ) , and there must be a place where @xmath231 since in a heat engine @xmath232 , and @xmath233 .",
    "let us denote the starting point of the interval by @xmath234 . in this interval",
    "we choose @xmath235 note that @xmath236 in both the end points of the interval , and its derivatives at the end points are zero , so @xmath212 is both continues and differentiable .",
    "its integral is given by @xmath237 moreover , @xmath238 since the prefactors of both @xmath212 and @xmath239 in the interval ( in which @xmath212 and @xmath239 are different then zero and do not change much ) , we can take them out of the integral , @xmath240      note that there are two scenarios in which the carnot efficiency can nevertheless be attained : ( i ) there is no section @xmath201 in which the system is in contact with the coldest bath .",
    "as explained , the power in this case is zero .",
    "( ii ) in the limit @xmath45 , eq.([eq : delta_lambda ] ) gives finite @xmath241 only if @xmath242 for all @xmath32 , so our choice of @xmath212 is inconsistent , and the argument for no protocol with carnot efficiency is invalid .",
    "this should be expected  there are definitely protocols that saturate the carnot bound in the @xmath45 limit ."

    "<S> heat engines that attain their maximal power and maximal efficiency ( which is either the carnot efficiency or a lower value ) at different working conditions are here defined as _ heat engines with a power - efficiency trade - off_. the power - efficiency trade - off is the subject of many recent studies @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the work and heat can be interpreted as areas in state space ( the space of all the possible states of the engine ) defined by the periodic trajectory of the engine s state . </S>",
