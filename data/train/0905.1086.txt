    "cyg x-3 is a high - mass binary with a wolf - rayet companion @xcite , with an unusually short orbital period of 4.8 h , located at a distance @xmath3 kpc in the galactic plane @xcite . due to the lack of reliable mass functions and determination of the inclination , it remains uncertain whether its compact object is a black hole or a neutron star ( see @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "however , the presence of a black hole is strongly favoured by considering the x - ray spectra , the radio emission , and the bolometric luminosity ( @xcite , hereafter sz08 ; @xcite , hereafter szm08 ; @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter hj09 ) .",
    "cyg x-3 is a persistent x - ray source .",
    "its x - ray spectra have been classified into 5 states by szm08 , who have also quantified their correlations with the radio states .",

    "we see a remarkable overall similarity between the spectra of the two objects , apart from the very strong absorption in cyg x-3 .",
    "its spectrum 5 is similar to the ultrasoft one of xte j1550564 .",
    "then , the spectra 3 and 4 are similar to the very high and high , respectively , states of xte j1550564 .",
    "finally , the hardest spectra of cyg x-3 , 1 and 2 , can be identified with the canonical low / hard state of black - hole binaries . here",
    ", however , the high - energy cut - off / break occurs in cyg x-3 at a lower energy , @xmath4 kev , than in other black - hole binaries , where it is at @xmath5200 kev , as seen in fig .",
    "[ 1550_x3 ] .",
    "initially , x - ray spectra of cyg x-3 were modelled rather phenomenologically , e.g. , by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , including , e.g , , power - law , blackbody and/or bremsstrahlung components .",
    "more recently , physically motivated models have been studied by @xcite , sz08 , @xcite and hj09 .",
    "when the hard - state spectra were fitted by thermal comptonization , the dominant process in the hard state @xcite , the obtained electron temperature was @xmath68 kev , much lower than @xmath7100 kev in the usual hard state of black - hole binaries ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an important , but not included yet in the spectral studies , physical process in cyg x-3 may be compton scattering by a relatively cold , ionized , plasma with a thomson optical depth @xmath8 , surrounding the x - ray source in cyg x-3 .",
    "the presence of a highly ionized thomson - thick absorber is indicated by a deep @xmath99 kev fe k edge seen in the x - ray spectra ( see , e.g. , sz08 ) .",
    "the presence of a thomson - thick plasma in cyg x-3 was postulated by , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite to account for the x - ray orbital modulation . also , @xcite proposed the presence of such plasma based on the power spectra of cyg x-3 .",
    "that study , however , was hampered by an unresolved ( at that time ) instrumental effect , which prevented @xcite from performing a more detailed study of the effect of scattering on the power spectra .",
    "the lack or weakness of x - ray variability at frequencies of @xmath10 hz in cyg x-3 was confirmed by @xcite .",
    "we note that neither @xcite , @xcite nor @xcite discussed effects of the scattering cloud on the x - ray spectra of the source .",
    "this effect was mentioned by hj09 , but not taken into account in their fits due to the lack of a readily available spectral model .",
    "the location of the thomson - thick plasma remains unclear .",
    "@xcite and @xcite estimated the thomson optical depth of the stellar wind from the wolf - rayet companion measured from the compact object towards the observer to be @xmath11 . on the other hand , sz08 found it to be @xmath12 .",
    "generally , as discussed by , e.g. , sz08 or @xcite , the estimates of the mass - loss rate and the wind clumping in cyg x-3 are uncertain , making these estimates relatively uncertain .",
    "the wind may also form a circumbinary envelope @xcite , which may be optically thick . on the other hand ,",
    "outflows from an accretion disc around the compact object may be optically thick as well , e.g. , @xcite . however , such outflows are usually axially symmetric around the compact object , which would not result in the observed orbital flux modulation .",
    "another possibility for the physical identification of the scattering cloud is a bulge formed by the stellar wind colliding with the accretion disc .    in this paper",
    ", we study in detail the effect of the presence of such plasma surrounding the x - ray source , on both the x - ray spectra ( section [ s : spectra ] ) and on the power spectra ( section [ s : timing ] ) in the hard state . in section [ s : equilibrium ] , we present our final model reproducing the energy and power spectra of cyg x-3 and satisfying thermal equilibrium in the scattering cloud . in section [",

    "the advantage of choosing the hard state is that it has usually a standard form with a pronounced high - energy cut - off , and it is well modelled by thermal comptonization in a hot plasma ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , high - energy tails in soft states",
    "exhibit a variety of spectral shapes , see , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "( although we find below that the reflection features in the intrinsic spectra are strongly smeared out in the scattered spectra , we keep them for physical consistency . )",
    "we assume seed photons comptonized by the hot plasma to have a disc blackbody spectrum with the maximum temperature of 0.3 kev .",
    "as shown e.g. , by sz08 , intrinsic x - ray absorption in cyg x-3 is very complex , caused by the stellar wind with at least two phases . here , we do not attempt to reproduce this complexity as it is not related to the main goal of this paper .",
    "instead , we simply model absorption ( of the photons leaving the scattering cloud ) as due to a neutral medium .",
    "also , we do not physically model the observed fe k line , produced apparently outside of the scattering cloud . instead , we simply add a gaussian line reproducing the observed line to our final spectra .",
    "since hard - state spectra of black - hole binaries extend well above 100 kev , we need to accurately take into account the klein - nishina effects in the postulated scattering medium . for that purpose",
    ", we use the monte carlo code of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the code has been extensively tested against other codes and solutions @xcite .",
    "we use a spherical geometry with uniform electron density , @xmath33 , and the source of photons at the centre .",
    "we note that the scattering medium in cyg x-3 is likely to be spherically asymmetric if it is formed by accretion , and it needs to be such in order to account for the observed orbital modulation ( section [ s : intro ] ) .",
    "however , here we attempt to reproduce only the properties averaged over the orbit , in particular , the average x - ray spectra of szm08 , for which purpose the assumed spherical symmetry is fully sufficient .",
    "the input photons have the x - ray spectrum as described above . in this section ,",
    "we consider only electrons at a temperature low enough for the effect of compton up - scattering to be negligible .",
    "this happens when the compton parameter of the scattering medium , @xmath34 ( which definition is valid for @xmath35 ) , is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the temperature , @xmath38 is the thomson optical depth , @xmath39 is the radius , all of the scattering cloud , and @xmath40 is the thomson cross section . in this section , we assume @xmath41 kev , which satisfies the above condition for the values of @xmath42 we find here .",
    "the models we consider are relatively complex . in particular ,",
    "they involve a convolution of intrinsic spectra produced by thermal comptonization in a hot plasma with the effect of compton scattering in the , much colder , surrounding cloud . in section [",
    "s : equilibrium ] below , we also find varying of the cloud temperature to be important and comptonization of thermal bremsstrahlung to be a major process . at present , convolution models describing compton scattering in a plasma of arbitrary thomson optical depth are not available in xspec .",
    "given the complexity of this problem , we defer obtaining green s functions for comptonization to a future work .",
    "thus , we are unable to formally fit x - ray count spectra . instead , we compare our models to the x - ray spectra of szm08 , which were de - convolved assuming hybrid - plasma models .",
    "this will only enhance some discrepancies of the present models with the spectra of szm08 obtained using different models , but it would not lead to a false agreement .",
    "we have found that we can reproduce the average hard - state spectra with @xmath43 , @xmath44 kev and @xmath45 , see fig .",
    "[ downscattering ] for details .",
    "the position of the peak of the down - scattered spectrum depends only weakly on @xmath13 , as it is roughly at @xmath46 @xcite ; however , the slope of the high - energy tail of the spectrum depends sensitively on it .",
    "the hardness of the spectrum below the peak depends on the compton parameter , @xmath14 ; therefore we obtain a lower value of it for the softer spectrum . as seen in fig .",
    "[ downscattering ] , we can reproduce rather well the high - energy parts of the spectra , @xmath47 kev . on the other hand , as discussed above , accurate modelling of the part of the spectrum at @xmath48 kev would require taking into account complicated physical processes in the inhomogeneous stellar wind , which we do not attempt here .",
    "@xcite calculated the distribution of the number of scatterings experienced by a photon emitted at the centre of an optically - thick sphere of cold electrons , given by their equation ( 18 ) .",
    "@xcite used that result to calculate the distribution of the time spent by a photon inside the sphere , @xmath49 , with certain additional approximations .",
    "in particular , they assumed that a photon scattering @xmath50 times has covered the thomson optical depth of exactly @xmath51 along its path , i.e. , they replaced directly @xmath50 by @xmath52 in equation ( 18 ) of @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the distribution of the number of scatterings after a given elapsed time is poissonian , see , e.g. , equation ( 6 ) in @xcite .",
    "thus , we can sum over @xmath50 for a given elapsed time , improving the accuracy with respect to the results of @xcite .",

    "we have compared these results against those from our monte carlo code in the spherical geometry .",
    "we have considered photon energies in the thomson regime since power spectra measured by _ rxte _",
    "pca correspond mainly to it .",
    "we note here that there is a difference between the distribution of the photon arrival time at the sphere surface and that measured by a remote observer .",
    "apart from a constant time shift , the latter is equal to the distribution measured at a plane tangent to the sphere . in units of the thomson time , the difference is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the angle at which a photon leaves the sphere with respect to the radial direction .",
    "thus , @xmath58 for photons leaving the sphere radially , and @xmath42 for photons tangent to the sphere surface .    using the monte carlo code ,",
    "we have found that the results based on @xcite approximate the actual distribution only for a very large optical depth of the sphere , @xmath59 or so . even including summation over the poissonian distribution gives still a poor agreement with the monte carlo results at @xmath60 , 7.5 , as we show in fig .",

    "if the original signal is sinusoidal , its amplitude is reduced to the absolute value of the transform of the scattered photons , which was done in @xcite . ] by @xmath80 . in general , damping due to scattering of an intrinsic variability can be calculated either using the convolution of the light curves , equation ( [ convolution ] ) , or by integrating the resulting power spectrum , equation ( [ product ] ) . the intrinsic power spectrum at @xmath81 is damped by @xmath82 , which quantity is shown in fig .",

    "an important consequence of the relatively small size of the scattering cloud derived above is that its cooling by the companion star will be ineffective .",
    "the stellar luminosity is estimated as @xmath103@xmath104 erg s@xmath105 ( see , e.g. , a discussion in sz08 ) .",
    "given @xmath106 , the cloud receives only @xmath107 , which is @xmath98 the x - ray luminosity of @xmath108 erg s@xmath105 regardless of the exact value of @xmath109 .",
    "thus , the scattering cloud will be effectively heated by photons of the x - ray source and the surrounding accretion disc , and will achieve an equilibrium temperature , @xmath110 , with radiative gains balanced by radiative losses .",
    "the amplification factor , @xmath111 , of the comptonizing cloud can generally be written as , @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the luminosity of the central hot - plasma source ( which is the only source of energy , and thus @xmath114 ) , and @xmath115 is the luminosity of this source after passing through the scattering cloud . for our parameters , @xmath116 usually ( though not necessarily ) , depending on both the parameters of the cloud ( @xmath37 , @xmath42 ) and the shape of the intrinsic spectrum , determined by @xmath27 and @xmath14 .",
    "we thus allow a free @xmath110 imposing initially the condition of @xmath117 . however , we find we can satisfy it only very roughly while keeping the model spectra fitting the data .",
    "the reason is that increasing @xmath110 moves the peak in the down - scattered spectrum up , which requires an increase of @xmath42 ( which moves the peak down ) to compensate for it , which in turn reduces @xmath118 , making it still @xmath119 .",
    "the obtained temperatures are @xmath120 kev , and the optical depths somewhat higher than in the models above , @xmath121 . for these parameters , we find , however , that bremsstrahlung emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) of the scattering plasma is a substantial source of photons at the above @xmath110 and @xmath42 .",

    "data for a luminous hard state of the black - hole candidate gx 3394 ( from 2002 april 23 , the observation i d 70109 - 01 - 04 - 00 ) , with the bolometric accretion luminosity of @xmath168 erg s@xmath105 at the assumed distance of 8 kpc @xcite , and we have found using compps @xmath169 kev ( with @xmath170 including a systematic error of the data of 2 per cent ) . on the other hand , the values of @xmath171 implied by our model ( at @xmath172 kpc and assuming isotropic emission ) in both of the analyzed hard states of cyg x-3 are @xmath173 erg s@xmath105 , relatively similar to that in gx 3394 .",
    "thus , @xmath174 kev in cyg x-3 appears to be an entirely plausible value .",
    "the temporal green s function for @xmath73 ( which is almost the same at @xmath175 kev as at @xmath176 kev ) is approximated by equation ( [ fit ] ) and it is shown in fig .",
    "[ tau5_7.5](b ) .",
    "its squared transform , @xmath82 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ attenuation ] . we have fitted it to the observed power spectrum at high frequencies ( assuming the intrinsic power @xmath177 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ power ] .",
    "the fit implies @xmath178 cm , almost the same as given by equation ( [ size ] ) .",
    "it is somewhat smaller than that found in section [ s : timing ] due to the lower value of @xmath43 found in the models neglecting cloud heating .",
    "given the obtained small size of the scattering cloud of @xmath179 cm , it can not be the stellar wind itself . a likely origin of the cloud appears to be collision of the gravitationally focused stellar wind with the outer edge of an accretion disc",
    ". the resulting cloud or bulge will be axially asymmetric with respect to the compact object ( as required by the observed orbital modulation of x - rays ) .",
    "the presence of such a bulge was recently found in the high - mass black - hole binary cyg x-1 @xcite . in cyg x-1 ,",
    "the bulge is thomson thin .",
    "however , the orbital separation , @xmath180 , in cyg x-3 is about 10 times lower than that in cyg x-1 , as well as the mass loss rate is at least 10 times higher ( e.g. , sz08 ) .",
    "thus , the bulge in cyg x-3 can easily have @xmath181 and engulf the x - ray source .",
    "the size of the bulge is then similar to that of the disc .",
    "since accretion in cyg x-3 proceeds via stellar wind , its outer radius , @xmath182 , is much smaller than that of the roche lobe @xcite . using their formalism , @xmath183 , where @xmath184",
    ", @xmath185 is the relative orbital velocity , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 is the wind velocity , which is @xmath188 cm s@xmath105 ( e.g. , sz08 ) .",
    "then , @xmath189 , e.g. , @xmath190 cm for plausible values of @xmath191 and @xmath192 @xcite .",
    "this also yields @xcite the fraction of the mass loss rate captured by the compact object in a rough agreement with our value of @xmath171 .",
    "the characteristic ionization parameter of the cloud is @xmath193 erg cm s@xmath105 , which implies that the cloud will be almost fully ionized . at the obtained rather high equilibrium @xmath176 kev",
    ", the plasma will also be strongly collisionally ionized .",
    "the observed fe k line and edge are thus formed mostly outside the cloud , in the stellar wind ( e.g. , sz08 ) .",
    "still , there may be some contribution of the scattering cloud to absorption , which may be tested with high energy - resolution data , e.g. , from _",
    "chandra_.    for the sake of simplicity , we have assumed the scattering cloud to have a uniform density . in reality",
    ", it will have a density gradient and no sharp edge .",
    "an effect of that will be a less gradual cut - off of the attenuation function . however , this effect is most important for low values of @xmath42 . at @xmath121 ,",
    "most of the scattering takes place relatively deep in the cloud and the surface effect is minor .",
    "an important finding of this study is the importance of thermal bremsstrahlung , which is otherwise found to be rather unimportant in black - hole binaries . in the present case ,",
    "its importance is related to the presence of a dense and compact scattering cloud , apparently due to a high density of the stellar wind at a very high mass loss rate in this very compact binary .",
    "the luminosity of the bremsstrahlung turns out to be just at the right level to yield the energy balance of the cloud , which is highly remarkable .",
    "as we see from equation ( [ brems ] ) , @xmath122 is determined by the cross section of the process , @xmath42 , @xmath110 and @xmath39 , and it could be in principle at any level .",
    "still , the values of @xmath42 and @xmath110 resulting from the spectral fitting and the value of @xmath39 determined by the observed power spectrum result in the value of @xmath122 just right to compensate for down - scattering losses of the primary emission due to thermal comptonization in a hot plasma .",
    "we consider this coincidence a strong argument for the correctness of the presented model .",
    "we note that an inhomogeneity of the scattering cloud would further enhance the bremsstrahlung emission by a factor of @xmath128 , see equation ( [ f ] ) .",
    "it is also of interest to consider the dynamical state of scattering cloud",
    ". it can not be free - falling as it would have given a too large accretion rate .",
    "it may be partly pressure supported .",
    "the dominant contribution to the pressure , @xmath194 , is found to be radiation , @xmath195 .",
    "then , the hydrostatic equilibrium , @xmath196 yields @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the eddington luminosity for @xmath199 ( which is higher for he than that for h by the factor of @xmath137 ) . this yields @xmath101 of several @xmath200 .",
    "this is , however , only an order of magnitude determination given our idealized model of a uniform cloud .",
    "furthermore , the cloud is likely to be in a state of sub - keplerian rotation , and thus partly centrifugally supported , which would increase the required @xmath101 .",
    "thus , our model is consistent with the presence of a black hole in cyg x-3 .",
    "on the other hand , we note that our determination of the size of the cloud rests on the cut - off in the power spectrum .",
    "if that cut - off has a different origin , the scattering cloud could have a much larger size , and thus be effectively cooled by the stellar photons .",
    "then , the models presented in section [ downscattering ] , which are not consistent with the derived small size , could still be the correct ones .",
    "we note , however , that those models yield the temperatures of the intrinsic hot plasma substantially lower ( and thus appearing less realistic ) than both those of the models in section [ s : equilibrium ] and those in the hard state of black - hole binaries .",
    "interestingly , our calculations yield almost the same intrinsic luminosities , @xmath171 , for the two hard spectral states considered . in general",
    ", we expect softer states to be more luminous ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , hysteresis effects in black - hole binaries often lead to different states to occur at the same luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and there are indication that such an effect also occurs in cyg x-3 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we have modelled only the hard part of the x - ray spectra .",
    "given the very strong absorption in this system , there may be an additional soft component , stronger in the softer of the two considered states .",
    "an indication for that is the difference in the fitted values of @xmath16 , with the apparently lower value of it in the softer state being possibly due to the presence of an additional soft emission .",
    "our obtained value of @xmath201 erg s@xmath105 is @xmath20270 per cent of the values obtained for the corresponding spectral states by hj09 . based on a comparison of the colour - luminosity diagram for cyg x-3 with that for black - hole binaries , hj09 favoured @xmath203 .",
    "our lower value of @xmath171 would imply a mass of @xmath204 of that , provided this argument holds . also , the parameters of the intrinsic x - ray emitting plasma derived by hj09 would need to be significantly revised due to the existence of a scattering cloud postulated in our model .",
    ", @xmath157 kev . in the intrinsic spectrum",
    ", a power law with the photon index of 2 is convolved with a wien spectrum with the temperature of 0.5 kev .",
    "the solid curve shows the intrinsic spectrum after transmission through the cloud , and the crosses show the transmitted spectrum after absorption by external matter with @xmath205 @xmath21 . for simplicity , neither bremsstrahlung nor compton reflection / fe k emission",
    "are taken into account . ]",
    "an important issue is whether our model is applicable also to soft states of cyg x-3 ( 3 , 4 , 5 in the classification of szm08 ) .",
    "since compton scattering of photons at a given energy moves them to a wide range of energies , there is no unique intrinsic spectrum corresponding to a given observed spectrum for given parameters of the scattering cloud , @xmath110 and @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , the parameters of the cloud may change between states , in particular @xmath110 follows from energy balance and thus depends on the incident spectrum .",
    "then , a possible approach is to take observed soft state spectra of black - hole binaries and see how compton scattering modifies them .",
    "however , this is a highly complex problem , given the wide range of observed soft state spectra , which requires a relatively large number of free parameters to model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we defer its systematic study to future work . here",
    ", we just consider one spectrum , which we model in a very simple way .",
    "we take the average spectrum 3 and the cloud parameters fitted to the spectrum 2 . as a simple intrinsic spectrum",
    ", we use the bmc model of xspec , which is a convolution of a power law with a wien spectrum kev for that process @xcite .",
    "still , bmc is a useful generic approximation to comptonization by non - thermal electrons . ] .",
    "we find that this model gives a relatively good description of the average spectrum 3 , see fig .",
    "[ state3 ] .",
    "since we use a phenomenological , i.e. , non - physical description of the input spectrum , we do not consider here the issues of energy balance or bremsstrahlung emission ( which we defer to a future study with a physical model , e.g. , that of hybrid comptonization , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "still , our results show the potential possibility of explaining also the soft spectra of cyg x-3 by a model with transmission through a scattering cloud .",
    "a test of our model can be performed by studying _ rxte _",
    "data for the hard states binned with respect to the orbital phase .",
    "from the expected anisotropy of the scattering cloud , the optical depth along the line of sight should be lower around the superior conjunction ( the compact object in front of the donor ) than around the inferior one .",
    "this would result in the cut - off of both the energy and power spectra being higher for the former case than for the latter .",
    "we have considered the x - ray spectra of cyg x-3 in its hard spectral state .",
    "the observed spectra show a cut - off / break at an unusually low energy .",
    "we find this can be explained if a standard x - ray source is surrounded by a thomson - thick cold plasma , which down - scatters the intrinsic x - ray spectrum .",
    "the presence of such a plasma was earlier postulated to explain the energy - independent x - ray orbital modulation and the lack of high frequencies in the power spectra .",
    "we use a monte carlo code to model the effect of compton scattering in the cold plasma on both spectra and variability . for the latter ,",
    "we obtain green s functions and their fourier transforms .",
    "our results show that compton scattering affects the power spectra at a frequency @xmath88 times lower than that obtained from considering the average number of scattering in the cloud .",
    "finally , we consider thermal equilibrium of the cloud in the field of the incident photons .",
    "the obtained model has the cloud temperature of @xmath176 kev , the optical depth of @xmath121 , and the cloud size of @xmath206 cm .",
    "we find that for those parameters , thermal bremsstrahlung emission of the cloud is important .",
    "then , the cooling by this mechanisms facilitates achieving the exact energy equilibrium of the cloud .",
    "the model reproduces both the x - ray spectrum and the power spectrum in the hard state .",
