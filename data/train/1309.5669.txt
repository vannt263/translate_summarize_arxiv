    "the quantum spin liquid ( qsl ) , a state which does not break any lattice or spin - rotational symmetry at zero temperature , has attracted much attention in the past twenty years .",
    "@xcite different from a trivial disordered state , the qsl possesses topological order  @xcite with the deconfined and fractionalized quasiparticles obeying the anyonic braiding statistics .",
    "the physics of the qsl may also have an implication for understanding the high temperature superconductivity .",
    "@xcite since anderson first proposed the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state for the triangular heisenberg magnet , @xcite the debate on whether a qsl is a realistic quantum state in two dimensional ( 2d ) systems has never ceased . in recent years , there is growing experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite evidence supporting the existence of the qsl in realistic materials or contrived model systems .",
    "theoretically , frustrated magnetic interactions may lead to a qsl .",
    "those systems impose serious difficulties for theoretical studies , where analytical methods are under development and the quantum monte carlo method is usually not applicable due to the sign problem . to tackle these problems ,",
    "the slave particle formalism @xcite has been developed and different model hamiltonians have been constructed , @xcite which give many insights for the properties of the qsl .",
    "however , these studies still can not provide concrete predictions regarding the existence of the qsl in more realistic quantum systems .",
    "the development of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite and the tensor network approach @xcite has opened a new route to study the qsl in general magnetic systems ; in particular , the accurate dmrg studies have provided extensive evidence for a possible gapped z@xmath0 qsl for the kagome lattice heisenberg model .",
    "@xcite however , the variational monte carlo @xcite study of the same system suggests a possible gapless qsl , which appears to be more consistent with experimental observations .",
    "@xcite recently , it has been suggested @xcite that both a small correlation length of one topological sector @xcite and the positively quantized topological entanglement entropy used in identifying the @xmath1 qsl @xcite may not be sufficient to fully establish the nature of the quantum state limited by the range of system sizes being studied .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to find other topological sectors , which may lead to a full understanding of the topological nature of qsl through extracting the modular matrix . @xcite",
    "dmrg has been proven powerful in solving the ground state of quasi - one dimensional frustrated magnets , @xcite however it can not directly obtain excited state accurately for larger systems , especially on a torus geometry where the topological degeneracies exist . in a recent work ,",
    "@xcite cincio and vidal showed that the topological degeneracy can be studied in an infinite cylinder , and they can obtain topological degenerate ground states by using random initial conditions in the infinite dmrg simulation .",
    "@xcite in this paper , we propose a systematical and controlled approach based on the dmrg calculations to find different topological degenerate sectors of the quantum system on an infinite cylinder . in sec .",
    "[ sec : top_deg ] , we briefly review the origin of topological degeneracy and derive topological degeneracies of a z@xmath0 as well as double - semion qsl phases .",
    "we show that different topological degenerate ground states differ from each other by certain type of quasiparticle ( spinon or vison for the qsl ) lines threaded in the system , and these states can be tuned into each other by inserting flux . in sec .",
    "[ sec : algorithm ] , we outline the general numerical scheme of the algorithm , which are based on the origin of topological degeneracy . we show that , to obtain topological degenerate ground states in qsl , two operations can be implemented in the dmrg simulation : ( 1 ) creating edge spinon . ( 2 ) adiabatically inserting @xmath2 flux . in sec .",
    "[ sec : winding_number ] , we discuss the relation between winding number and spinon line .",
    "we also propose a simple method to determine the presence of spinon line by observing the entanglement spectrum . in sec .",
    "[ sec : easy_axis ] , we apply the method to the anisotropic easy axis kagome heisenberg model ( eakm ) , which is shown to host a z@xmath0 qsl theoretically @xcite and numerically .",
    "@xcite we successfully find four topological degenerate states and calculate various quantities to show that they are four distinct states .",
    "further , in sec .",
    "[ sec : khm ] , we apply our method to nearest neighbor kagome heisenberg model ( khm ) . for the khm ,",
    "we have only identified two topological sectors , however , our results may provide a good approximation on the properties of other topological sectors . we find that the states in the new topological sectors have a much larger correlation length , which demands future study .",
    "the topological degeneracy originates from the existence of the fractionalized quasiparticles and their anyonic braiding statistics . following ref .",
    ", we will give an exact derivation of the topological degeneracy in z@xmath0 and double - semion qsl .",
    "@xcite either z@xmath0 or double - semion qsl supports two kinds of fractionalized excitations , spinon and vison . to deduce the topological degeneracies",
    ", we should first define the wilson loop operator @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : top_deg ] ) , which creates a pair of spinons ( visons ) , then winds them along @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) direction , and finally annihilates them . if the system has a gap and we drag the quasiparticles slowly enough , the system will get back into the ground state after the annihilation of quasiparticles . therefore , no matter whether there is ground state degeneracy , we can always find a ground state @xmath7 which is the eigenstate of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 , satisfying @xmath10 and @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 are non - universal numbers , for simplicity we just take them to be @xmath13 . in the following ,",
    "we will use two ways to derive that the system also has three other topological degenerate ground states @xmath14 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , whose corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 : @xmath19 these topological degenerate ground states , defined by eigenstates of the wilson loop operator along @xmath6 direction , are the minimal entangled states introduced in ref . .",
    "one way to derive the topological degeneracy is using the existence of the deconfined fractionalized quasiparticles .",
    "similar to the fractional quantum hall effect , one can insert flux @xmath20 in the torus along @xmath5 direction .",
    "we call the corresponding operators @xmath21",
    ". then , the spinon ( vison ) circles around @xmath6 direction will acquire an aharonov ",
    "bohm phase @xmath22 , where the charge of the quasiparticle is @xmath23 .",
    "thus , @xmath24 if one inserts @xmath2 flux , the system will be brought back into the original system , however , due to the fractional charge , the aharonov ",
    "bohm phase from the flux will be @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , @xmath26 is just the state @xmath14 , @xmath27 . in general",
