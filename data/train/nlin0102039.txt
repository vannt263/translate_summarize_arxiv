    "the general theory of periodic orbit quantization was first developed many years ago by gutzwiller @xcite and has ever since played an important role in our understanding of chaotic systems in the semiclassical regime . by applying stationary phase approximations to the trace of the green s operator , gutzwiller was able to derive a semiclassical formula for the density of states as the sum of a smooth part and an oscillating sum over all periodic orbits of the corresponding classical system .",
    "gutzwiller s ` trace formula ' , however , is only valid for isolated periodic orbits which , in general , restricts his results to fully chaotic systems where the dynamics is completely hyperbolic .    at the other end of",
    "the scale lie integrable systems .",
    "armed with the knowledge of all constants of motion one may obtain the semiclassical eigenenergies using ebk torus quantization @xcite .",
    "alternatively , berry and tabor @xcite showed that ebk quantization could be recast as a ` topological sum ' over the periodic orbits and obtained an analogue of gutzwiller s trace formula for integrable systems .",
    "the berry - tabor formula has also been extended into the near - integrable regime @xcite .",
    "however most physical systems are of a mixed type , exhibiting both regular and chaotic behaviour .",
    "some progress on the periodic orbit quantization of mixed systems has also been made @xcite .",
    "the theory referred to above is for autonomous systems .",
    "the dynamics of periodically driven systems and quantum maps is best described by the so - called floquet operator @xcite . upon deriving an approximation for",
    "the trace of this unitary operator in terms of the classical periodic orbits , one may obtain a semiclassical approximation for the spectral density of its eigenphases .",
    "this trace formula has been derived for a class of maps on the plane @xcite , on the torus @xcite and for an array of special mappings with mixed results . the trace formula for arnold s",
    "cat map is exact @xcite .",
    "however the more general sawtooth map gives poor results @xcite .",
    "it was found necessary to include boundary contributions in the trace formula of the baker s",
    "map @xcite , while ghost contributions needed to be included in the case of the kicked top @xcite and the standard map @xcite .",
    "poincar maps have also been considered @xcite .",
    "the model for which we will apply gutzwiller s method of periodic orbit quantization is quite dissimilar to the above mappings .",
    "the dynamics of our model is dominated by an infinite number of isolated stable periodic orbits of arbitrarily long period .",
    "the resonances associated with these periodic orbits are circular disks and fill in the phase space in a manner resembling circle packings .",
    "three of these mappings were introduced in a previous paper @xcite , each corresponding to a particular phase space geometry : planar , hyperbolic and spherical .",
    "we will consider only the spherical map in this paper .",
    "its quantum analogue lives in a finite dimensional hilbert space allowing us to circumvent convergence problems associated with semiclassical trace formulae @xcite .",
    "in addition , our model does not suffer from the exponential proliferation of periodic orbits found in most chaotic systems .",
    "the task of finding all periodic orbits of a given period is much simplified with the help of symbolic labeling and the use of special symmetries .",
    "our mapping is not chaotic in a strict sense .",
    "however the presence of infinitely many stable periodic orbits with arbitrarily long period generates highly irregular motion .",
    "this behaviour is located on the borderline between regular and chaotic motion , but in a manner very different from the generic case of kam systems .",
    "the strong deviation is explained by the mapping s non - smooth construction .",
    "our motivation for considering such a system is as follows .",
    "tests of the applicability of periodic orbit quantization as a theory which adequately describes quantum systems in their semiclassical limit has , for the most part , been focussed on fully chaotic systems .",
    "systems with regions of stability have been ignored due to complications in the theory which arise whenever non - isolated periodic orbits are present . for integrable systems ,",
    "the presence of periodic tori surrounding each stable periodic orbit is accommodated in the theory of berry and tabor .",
    "however when such a system is perturbed into the near - integrable regime , these tori resonate and form island chains of high - order stable and unstable periodic orbits of equal period .",
    "if the perturbation is small , the newly created periodic orbits will not be sufficiently isolated , and hence , gutzwiller s theory can not be applied . in such cases ,",
    "uniform approximations need to be made which bridge the gap between the two theories @xcite . for chaotic systems ,",
    "each stable periodic orbit is locally near - integrable , and in general , will always be accompanied by island chains of non - isolated periodic orbits , which again inhibit the application of gutzwiller s theory . to explore the limits of periodic orbit quantization for the case of stable motion we need to first investigate ` toy systems ' of low generality like ours where the method is expected to work best .",
    "the circular resonances associated with each stable periodic orbit of our mapping rotate about each point of the orbit in a linear fashion , and hence , contain no high - order resonances . for almost all parameter values",
    ", the period of rotation will be an irrational multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , each stable periodic orbit will be isolated by the radius of its circular resonance , which , for a careful choice of the parameter values , can be made large enough such that gutzwiller s theory is applicable .",
    "the low generality of our model should not render our research as being futile or purely academic .",
    "indeed , the investigation of other toy systems , such as sinai s billiard , has led to much insight for the hyperbolic case @xcite .",
    "our paper is sectioned as follows . in section [ sectionii ]",
    "we review the classical map and construct its generating function . for a more detailed exposition of the classical map one should refer to @xcite . in section [ sectioniii ] we introduce the quantum map and spin coherent states . using these states as a basis",
    ", we then derive semiclassical matrix elements of the floquet operator in section [ sectioniv ] , followed by semiclassical traces and eigenphases in section [ sectionv ] .",
    "the theory in these sections follows the work by ku et al .",

    "the classical evolution of @xmath6 is governed by the equations @xmath7 where @xmath8 are the poisson brackets .",

    "the great circle @xmath17 remains fixed .",
    "then the entire sphere is rotated about the @xmath18 axis through an angle @xmath19 .",
    "thus the map rotates every point on the sphere in a piecewise linear fashion except on @xmath17 where its jacobian is singular .",
    "surprisingly , this leads to a phase space of great structural complexity . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we give examples for two different parameter values .",
    "the eastern hemisphere is shown in black , the western in gray .",
    "we will only consider the semiclassical quantization when @xmath20 as in figure [ fig1](b ) .     and",
    "( a ) @xmath21 , ( b ) @xmath22 . ]",
    "note that if an orbit of our map does not have a point on @xmath17 , then its lyapunov exponents are zero , making it stable .",
    "if however , it does have a point on @xmath17 , then its lyapunov exponents are undefined .",
    "we overcome this problem by simply defining an unstable orbit to be one with a point on @xmath17 , and all others stable .",
    "the unstable set is defined to be the closure of the set of all images and preimages of the great circle @xmath17 . in figures",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] the unstable set is in black and gray .",
    "the circular holes are resonances consisting entirely of stable orbits . at their center",
    "lies a stable periodic orbit .",
    "it is these stable periodic orbits which will be used for the semiclassical quantization .",
    "all other points inside the resonances rotate about the central periodic orbit in a linear fashion .",
    "the period of rotation is an irrational multiple of @xmath0 for almost all values of the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath19 , and hence , no other periodic orbits are located inside the resonances . in our case of study ( figure [ fig1](b ) ) , we have chosen @xmath14 to be large enough such that no island chains of first - order resonances form to create periodic quasi - tori ( as in figure [ fig1](a ) ) .",
    "hence we have done our best to ensure that all of the stable periodic orbits are sufficiently isolated .",
    "the unstable periodic orbits are shown not to affect leading terms in the asymptotic analysis .",
    "we have previously shown @xcite that it is possible to label every point of a stable .",

    "periodic orbit of least period @xmath23 with a unique sequence @xmath24 .",
    "the position of the point is given by the solution of @xmath25 lying on the unit sphere with @xmath26 .",
    "the other @xmath27 points of the periodic orbit are found by substituting the @xmath27 cycles of the original sequence into ( [ per ] ) .",
    "hence , if @xmath28 is a stable periodic orbit then the sequence corresponding to its first point is @xmath29 .",
    "note that the ( unnormalized ) solution of ( [ per ] ) is simply the axis of rotation of r , namely @xmath30    although every periodic point is uniquely represented by a sequence , not every sequence represents a periodic point .",
    "hence we still need to find which sequences are legitimate .",
    "this may be done by checking each of the @xmath31 different possible sequences for a period-@xmath23 orbit .",
    "however , this is computationally expensive for large periods . an alternative is to exploit symmetries of our mapping .",
    "we have previously conjectured @xcite that every stable periodic orbit has exactly one or two points on one of the following symmetry lines on the unit sphere : @xmath32 it is easy to prove that if a stable periodic orbit has one point on a particular symmetry line , then it has no more than two points on this line . however , we were not able to show that a stable periodic orbit _ must _ have a point on one of these lines , though numerical investigations suggest they do .",
    "we have checked all @xmath33 of the possible sequences for a stable periodic orbit of period @xmath34 and only found those of the above type .",
    "if one assumes our conjecture to be true then it is computationally easy to find all of the stable periodic orbits with periods upwards of 300 000 .",
    "this may be done by finding where each symmetry line intersects with its image ; an effortless task to solve numerically by virtue of the simplicity of our mapping .",
    "every image of a symmetry line is just a collection of arc segments on the sphere .",
    "once a periodic point is found , the size of its circular resonance can be calculated by noting that the resonance of at least one point of the orbit must touch @xmath17 .",
    "this is because the boundary of each resonance forms part of the unstable set , and hence , iterates arbitrarily close to @xmath17 .",
