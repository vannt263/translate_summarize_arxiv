    "ground - based surveys have discovered dozens of transiting exoplanets around bright @xmath16 stars .",
    "those discoveries are of considerable importance because they enable cost - effective detailed measurements of physical properties of extrasolar planets and their host stars ( see reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "discoveries of transiting exoplanets that have characteristics similar to an already well - measured exoplanet , but that differ significantly in one aspect , are of particularly high importance because they enable comparative studies .",
    "the high scientific value of transiting planet systems motivated the first dedicated wide - field transit surveys , which have now produced a large number of discoveries ( tres , @xcite ; xo , @xcite ; hatnet , @xcite ; superwasp , @xcite , qes , @xcite ) .",
    "superwasp and hatnet have been especially productive , with each survey discovering dozens of new transiting planets .",
    "the space - based missions corot @xcite and kepler @xcite have dramatically expanded the parameter space of transit surveys , enabling the detection of transiting planets with sizes down to that of the earth and below , planets with periods of several years , and planets orbiting host stars with a wider range of physical characteristics .",
    "the kilodegree extremely little telescope - north ( kelt - north ) transit survey @xcite is designed to detect transiting planets around bright stars .",
    "@xcite designed the aperture , optical system , and exposure time for kelt - north to provide better than 1% rms photometry for stars with @xmath17 .",
    "that magnitude range represents the brightness gap between comprehensive rv surveys and most other transit surveys .",
    "the kelt - north telescope system was constructed using commercial off - the - shelf equipment and has been collecting data since september 2006 .",
    "the kelt - north survey has already announced three low - mass transiting companions .",
    "@xcite is a highly inflated @xmath18 brown dwarf transiting a @xmath19 mid - f star .",
    "kelt-2ab @xcite is a hot jupiter transiting the bright @xmath20 primary star of a binary system .",
    "kelt-3b @xcite is a hot jupiter planet transiting a @xmath21 late - f star .",
    "the designations kelt-4 and kelt-5 are currently reserved for two candidates in the confirmation phase .    because kelt - north has focused on the same fields for an extended length of time ( @xmath22 years ) , longer period ( @xmath23 ) planets",
    "are now detectable in the data .",
    "the large number of observations of each field also enables the detection of smaller planet - to - star radius ratios . in this paper",
    "we describe the discovery and characterization of kelt-6b , a transiting mildly - inflated saturn - mass planet orbiting a @xmath0 metal - poor host bd+31 2447 ( hereafter kelt-6 ) .",
    "kelt-6b is currently the sixth longest period exoplanet discovered by a ground - based transit survey , after hat - p-15b , hat - p-17b , wasp-8b , wasp-59b , and wasp-84b . in several important aspects",
    ", kelt-6b resembles a metal - poor analog of one of the most well - studied transiting planets , hd  209458b @xcite .",
    "both hosts have similar effective temperatures of @xmath24 , although kelt-6 is significantly more evolved and therefore has a larger radius .",
    "on the other hand , kelt-6b has a substantially larger orbit than hd 209458b . as a result ,",
    "the incident fluxes at both planets are very similar .",
    "in addition , the surface gravity of kelt-6b differs from that of hd  209458b by only @xmath25 .",
    "the discovery of kelt-6b offers an opportunity to perform a comparative measurement of two similar planets in similar environments around stars of very different metallicities .",
    "the comparison may , for example , elucidate the effect of bulk composition of the planet atmosphere on the cause of atmospheric temperature inversions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , host - star metallicity has been shown to affect the physical and orbital properties of planets .",
    "in particular , there is a rough correlation between metallicity and estimated core mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and there are indications of trends in the properties of planets with metallicity , which may signal the existence of multiple mechanisms for the formation and/or delivery of close - in giant planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we provide a brief summary of the kelt survey data reduction process in  [ sec : keltobs ] ; for more details , see  2 of @xcite .",
    "kelt-6 is in kelt - north survey field 08 , which is centered on ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 ; j2000 ) .",
    "we monitored field 08 from december 2006 , to june 2011 , collecting a total of 7359 observations .",
    "we reduced the raw survey data using a custom implementation of the isis image subtraction package @xcite , combined with point - spread fitting photometry using daophot @xcite . using proper motions from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite and j and h magnitudes from 2mass ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , we implemented a reduced proper motion cut @xcite based on the specific implementation of @xcite , in order to select likely dwarf and subgiant stars within the field for further post - processing and analysis .",
    "we applied the trend filtering algorithm ( tfa ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to each remaining light curve to remove systematic noise , followed by a search for transit signals using the box - fitting least squares algorithm ( bls ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for both tfa and bls we used the versions found in the vartools package @xcite .",
    "one of the candidates from field 08 was star bd+31 2447 / tyc  2532 - 556 - 1 , located at ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 ; j2000 ) .",
    "the star has tycho magnitudes @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite , and passed our initial selection cuts .",
    "the discovery light curve of kelt-6 is shown in figure [ fig : kelt_lc ] .",
    "we observed a transit - like feature at a period of 7.8457 days , with a depth of about 5 mmag .",
    "2-hour intervals after phase - folding .",
    "[ fig : kelt_lc ] ]      after kelt-6 was selected as a candidate , we conducted radial - velocity ( rv ) observations to identify possible false - positive signatures and to determine the rv orbit .",
    "we obtained data using the tillinghast reflector echelle spectrograph ( tres ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , on the 1.5 m tillinghast reflector at the fred l. whipple observatory ( flwo ) at mt .",
    "hopkins , az . we observed kelt-6 three times with tres over three months , from ut 2012 - 04 - 12 to ut 2012 - 07 - 09 .",
    "the spectra have a resolving power of r=44,000 , and were extracted following the procedures described by @xcite .",
    "these three initial tres single - order absolute rvs are listed in table [ tab : rv1 ] and are consistent with no rv variations to within the errors , ruling out some classes of astrophysical false positives .",
    "however , the tres rv uncertainties are large enough to still allow for a low - mass companion at the @xmath32d period of the kelt - north candidate signal , and on that basis we chose to continue with photometric follow - up .",
    "note that due to the relatively large uncertainties , we chose not to include these tres velocities in the final global analysis described in ",
    "[ sec : exofast ] .    on ut 2012 - 06 - 26 , we obtained high precision kelt-6 follow - up photometry of the final third of a predicted transit and detected an apparent shallow egress ( see  [ sec : phot ] ) .",
    "based on that detection and the lack of rv variations in the tres data , we decided to pursue higher - precision rv data .    using the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires ) instrument @xcite on the keck i telescope located on mauna kea , hawaii",
    ", we obtained 16 exposures between ut 2012 - 08 - 24 and ut 2013 - 02 - 21 with an iodine cell , plus a single iodine - free template spectrum .",
    "the absolute and precise relative rv measurements are listed in table [ tab : rv1 ] , and figure [ fig : rv ] shows the hires relative rv data phased to the orbit fit with a linear trend of @xmath33 m s@xmath34 day@xmath34 ( see  [ sec : exofast ] ) removed , along with the residuals to the model fit .",
    "the hires radial velocity observations were made using the standard setup of the california planet search ( cps ) program @xcite . a pyrex cell containing gaseous iodine",
    "is placed in front of the spectrometer entrance slit , which imprints a dense set of molecular iodine lines on each stellar spectrum .",
    "the iodine lines provide a calibration of the instrumental profile as well as a precise measure of the wavelength scale at the time of observation @xcite .",
    "we measured the relative stellar radial velocities using the forward - modeling scheme of @xcite with improvements made over the years .",
    "we measured the absolute rvs using the methods of @xcite .",
    "the psf varies quite dramatically in the slit - fed hires instrument simply from guiding and spectrometer focus variations .",
    "since line asymmetries due to instrumental and stellar sources can not be easily distinguished , we do not attempt to measure bisector spans for the hires observations .    we also obtained five rv measurements between ut 2013 - 02 - 01 and ut 2013 - 02 - 15 using the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) .",
    "however , these data were taken without an iodine cell for wavelength reference , and as a result the uncertainties are > 6 km s@xmath34 , so we do not list them in the rv table or use them in the global fit analysis in  [ sec : exofast ] .    finally , 21 additional tres rvs were obtained and reduced using multi - order analysis after most of the global analysis had been completed .",
    "the full tres rv dataset is listed in table [ tab : rv1 ] and contains measurements from 24 different nights between ut 2012 - 04 - 12 and ut 2013 - 07 - 31 , with typical relative uncertainties of 20 m  s@xmath34 .",
    "although we do not use the tres rv data in our global fit analysis ( see  [ sec : global_fits ] ) , we note that these data independently confirm both the amplitude of the kelt-6b rv variations ( see figure [ fig : rv ] ) and the linear trend of the fiducial global fit ( see  [ sec : tertiary ] ) , albeit with larger uncertainties due to the somewhat worse precision than the keck data .",
    "bisector spans were calculated from the tres spectra following @xcite and are used in  [ sec : falsepos ] as part of the false positive analysis .",
    "the bisector spans are listed in table [ tab : rv1 ] , and shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : rv ] phased to the orbital fit .",

    ". however these parameter coefficients were otherwise allowed to vary freely in order to minimize @xmath96 .",
    "one detrending parameter we included that warrants additional discussion is an offset in the zero point of the photometry arising from a change in placement of the target and/or comparison star(s ) on the ccd pixel array during time series observations .",
    "these positional changes typically result in a zero point shift in the photometry at that epoch in the light curve due to interpixel response differences and imperfect flat - field corrections .",

    "we therefore chose detrending parameters for such ingress- or egress - only data by hand using aij without a rigorous @xmath95 analysis .",

    "in addition to the slope , there were four additional choices that had to be considered when performing the global fit .",

    "we then computed the four combinations of global fits using the 5 full transits with the yonsei - yale constraints and found that for these fits the resulting @xmath63 and @xmath62 values were consistent with the corresponding yonsei - yale stellar evolution tracks within @xmath89 error .",

    "we next considered the 16 full and partial transit global fits .",
    "we computed only the four combinations corresponding to the adopted yonsei - yale constrained global fits .",

    "this is to be expected since detrended partial light curves will not add significant constraints to transit depth and shape when jointly fit with full transits . given the partial transit minor convergence issues , concerns about the ability to properly remove systematics from these light curves , and the lack of significant additional constraints on transit depth and shape from the partial transits , we adopted the global fits based on the 5 full transits .",
