    "lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) are by definition characterized by a strong absorption longward of the  wavelength due to intervening intergalactic gas and intrinsic uv emission of strong star formation , and so can easily be found using the color ",
    "color technique ( steidel et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "this technique is efficient for redshifts larger than 2 , where intergalactic absorption is more pronounced and the galaxy uv flux is redshifted to the optical , allowing observations from the ground .",
    "the rest frame uv spectrum of a galaxy bears the signature of its interstellar medium through absorption lines and stellar activity through line and broad band emission .",
    "although low resolution uv spectra of galaxies are available for the local universe , high resolution data are strongly limited by the low efficiency of space telescopes .",
    "only recently the far uv spectrograph ( fuse ) started to deliver high resolution ( hr , @xmath17 ) spectra of nearby star forming galaxies , revealing for the first time complex structures ( heckman et al . , 2001 ) .    in principle",
    ", high redshift galaxies can benefit of the fact that their uv emission is redshifted to the optical and can , therefore , be studied by large ground - based telescopes . however ,",
    "their apparent optical magnitude is generally fainter than @xmath18 and hr spectroscopy can not be performed .",
    "other possible candidates for hr spectroscopy are the very powerful radio galaxies , but no radio galaxy at redshift larger than @xmath19 and brighter than @xmath20 has been found so far .",
    "this limit is just a little beyond the hr capabilities of the largest telescopes .",
    "the chance to observe high redshift galaxies at high spectral resolution is then confined to gravitational lensed galaxies and gamma ray burst ( grb ) afterglows .",
    "the latter are indeed potentially very interesting for future observations ( fiore et al . , 2000 )",
    "thanks to the advent of new x  ray satellites ( hete2 and in the near future swift ) that are capable of prompt identification of grbs .",
    "the former are still penalized by a limited number of sufficiently bright targets .",
    "a unique case is the galaxy ms1512cb58 ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this very bright gravitational lens lbg ( @xmath21 , ellingson et al . , 1996 ) is within the state of the art capabilities of hr spectrographs of the largest ground based telescopes .",
    "it was serendipitously discovered by yee et al .",
    "( 1996 ) during the cnoc cluster redshift survey and is gravitationally lensed by the cluster ms1512 + 36 at @xmath22 ( seizt et al .",
    "the gravitational magnification has been studied in detail by seitz et al .",
    "( 1998 ) who found that the @xmath23 arcsec@xmath24 arclet brightness is amplified @xmath25 times by the cd galaxy of the cluster , 6@xmath26 apart .",
    "since this is the brightest lbg galaxy known , it has been widely studied in the optical , submillimeter and radio bands , both in imaging and spectroscopy .",
    "optical low resolution spectra obtained with keck / liris ( pettini et al . , 2000 ) showed the complex structure of the interstellar medium of the galaxy .",
    "observations of cb58 were performed using the uv  visual echelle spectrograph ( uves ) of the eso very large telescope ( vlt ) .",
    "this instrument / telescope combination is the best possible today for  forest observations .",
    "the main motivation of the program was to investigate the intervening absorption and compare its properties with the equivalent in qso forests .",
    "the results of the analysis of the intergalactic  forest distributed along the cb58 sight line are presented in this paper .",
    "the second goal was the study of the metallicity and dust content in the interstellar medium of the galaxy itself .",
    "these results will be presented in a future paper .",
    "the galaxy ms1512cb58 ( @xmath27 @xmath28 , j2000 ) was observed with the high resolution uv  visual echelle spectrograph ( uves , dekker et al . , 2000 )",
    "mounted at the ut2 telescope of the vlt observatory , at paranal ( chile ) .",
    "the program was run in service observing mode between march and august 2000 .",
    "the log of the observations is shown in table [ t1 ] .",
    "the red and blue arms of uves were used , centered at @xmath29   and 4370  , respectively . due to the high declination of the object with respect to the latitude of the vlt observatory ( @xmath30 ) , the observations were performed in chunks of @xmath31 hours around the meridian ( @xmath32 above the horizon ) to minimize atmospheric absorption .",
    "indeed , the airmass ranged between 2.1 , the minimum value for this object observed from paranal , and 2.3 . in order to maximize the signal  to  noise ratio ( s / n ) , the ccd was rebinned @xmath33 pixels during observations . due to good seeing conditions ,",
    "the slit aperture was always set to @xmath34 and @xmath35 for the red and blue arm set ",
    "ups , respectively , and its inclination was along the galaxy apparent major axis .",
    "the data reduction has been performed using a midas package specifically implemented for uves data .",
    "the final useful spectral coverage was @xmath36   for the blue arm , and @xmath37   and @xmath38   for the red arm .",
    "the pixel size was set to a constant value of 0.2   in the final combined spectrum .",
    "the final resolution element corresponding to two pixels then ranges from fwhm @xmath39  at 4150  , to 26  at the , to 19  at 6206  .",
    "the noise spectrum , used to determine the errors on the line parameters , has been calculated through photon statistics propagation of object and sky spectra and the detector read  out  noise .",
    "the final s / n ratio per resolution element is s / n@xmath40 at @xmath41  , s / n@xmath42 at @xmath43  , s / n@xmath44 at @xmath45  , and s / n @xmath46 at @xmath47  .",
    "the fit to the continuum blueward of the galaxy  was performed interpolating between points of the observed flux free of apparent absorption .",
    "although this is not particularly easy due to the non  excellent s / n ratio of the spectrum , at these redshifts the line density of  clouds allows the detection of several regions that are most likely unabsorbed .",
    "the final normalized galaxy and noise per resolution element spectra in the interval @xmath48   are shown in fig .",
    "the magnification of cb58 and the excellent performance of uves make this galaxy the only suitable candidate today to study the intergalactic matter distributed along a galaxy sight line , similarly to what is normally done for qso sight lines .",
    "the study of qso  forests has led in the past to a broad understanding of the formation and evolution of the universe . very briefly",
    "we mention successful experiments to test the intergalactic medium ( igm ) reionization through the gunn ",

    "( 2000 ) , ellison et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , just to mention the most recent publications on these subjects .    for the first time we can test some of these results considering a galaxy line of sight .",
    "any deviation from the expected properties of the igm might be strongly connected to a deviation of the galaxy surrounding environment with respect to the qso ones . to study the cloud distribution in cb58 ,",
    "we have performed line fitting with voigt profiles using the midas package fitlyman ( fontana & ballester , 1985 ) .",

    "the upper limit is set by the wavelength of the galaxy  line .",
    "[ f1 ] shows the  forest of cb58 , together with the fitted absorption profiles . in this range",
    "some metal lines associated with cb58 itself have been identified and fitted for completeness .",
    "no other metal lines associated with intervening metal systems at @xmath50 and 1.339 reported by pettini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and at @xmath51 , 2.117 and 2.660 identified by us , have been found in this interval .    in table  [ t2 ]",
    "we report absorption line parameters for the  lines only , namely the redshift @xmath52 , column density @xmath53 , and the doppler parameter @xmath54 .",
    "the intrinsic spectrum of the galaxy shows a very large   absorption that extends almost 100   in the range @xmath55  .",
    "this large trough has been considered by pettini et al .",
    "( 2000 ) as a single interstellar cloud at @xmath56 with an hi column density of @xmath57 2 , assuming that the peak around 4540   is due to  emission of cb58 redshifted to @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) . making the same assumption",
    "we find a slightly lower hi content , but still consistent with pettini et al.s result , with @xmath60 2  and redshift @xmath61 .",
    "however we also notice that in our spectrum the core of this  absorption ( @xmath62  ) is not completely black , and a small residual mean flux of about 1@xmath63 above the zero level is present .",
    "this might indicate that the interstellar clouds are not fully covering the star forming regions of the galaxy and/or that resonant scattering fills up part of the absorption .",
    "other metal lines associated with cb58 are listed in table [ t3 ] . due to the large hi absorption and metal lines associated with the galaxy , we have considered in our analysis the  forest shortward of @xmath64  , namely , the redshift range @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) . since the galaxy intrinsic brightness is much lower than a typical distant qso , the classical proximity effect , that in a qso decreases the cloud density within @xmath67 mpc from the source due to the high qso uv ionizing flux , is in the case of cb58 negligible . indeed , taking the observed magnitude and magnification , the absolute magnitude of the galaxy is @xmath68 , that is several hundreds times fainter than a high redshift qso typically used for proximity effect studies .",
    "for instance , if we compare cb58 with a qso 400 times brighter , the ionization region is 20 times smaller .",
    "this is even smaller if we consider that the spectrum of a galaxy is much softer than that of a qso and that the intensity of uv ionizing spectrum is much weaker .",
    "we conclude that the proximity distance for cb58 is confined to within 1 mpc from the galaxy center .",
    "the upper redshift limit of @xmath69 corresponds to a comoving distance from the galaxy of about 90 @xmath70 mpc ( we adopt throughout the paper a flat universe with non - zero cosmological constant : @xmath8 and @xmath71 ) . in the following sections we discuss how an excess of  clouds can be present if the galaxy is embedded in a rich environment which might be typical for a star forming high redshift galaxy .    to make a comparison with mean absorption in qso sight lines , we have considered two approaches : @xmath72",
    "we have measured the mean flux depression blueward of the cb58  line ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath73 we calculated the number density of  clouds .",
    "the mean flux depression @xmath5 overcomes the problem of moderate signal  to  noise ratio in the spectrum .",
    "it is defined by the equation :    @xmath74    where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the observed and intrinsic galaxy fluxes , respectively , in the  forest between the rest frame  and  wavelengths .",
    "this quantity is also expressed in terms of the effective optical depth in the same region :    @xmath77    and has been measured in the past in qso sight lines when the data quality did not allow an accurate column density determination of absorption lines ( e.g , giallongo & cristiani , 1990 ) .",
    "more recently fardal et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have computed @xmath5 using different models of intergalactic absorption and compared results with observations .",

    "for all the four qso spectra , we have excluded the proximity effect region . for gb1759 + 7539 , we have calculated the mean depression redward of the qso  emission and far from the proximity effect and from a large hi absorption due to an intervening damped  system at @xmath89 .",
    "for he13472457 we have considered the region 4050   @xmath90 4250  .",
    "for j2233606 we have excluded the region with two strong hi absorptions ( @xmath91 atoms 2 ) associated with two metal systems at @xmath92 .    for cb58",
    "we have calculate @xmath5 in the range 4150   @xmath93 4430  , corresponding to @xmath94 . for the uncertainties on the mean depression ,",
    "we have re  calculated @xmath5 considering as a new continuum the original estimate @xmath95% for cb58 , gb1759 + 7539 and j2233606 , and @xmath96% for he13472457 and hs1946 + 7658 , respectively , according to s / n .",
    "we take as our error the uncertainty derived according to this procedure .",
    "the value of @xmath5 in the whole cb58 interval at @xmath97 is @xmath98 .",
    "this is consistent with the value calculated from the model of the fitted voigt profiles listed in table [ t2 ] , i.e. @xmath99 . the total mean depression @xmath5 in the qsos is given in table [ t4 ] , while in table [ t5 ] we report @xmath5 in different redshift intervals for cb58 and the qsos , with the error range between brackets .",
    "these values of @xmath5 have been combined with results for other qsos given by kim et al .",
    "( 2001a ) and reported , as a function of redshift , in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] .    considering the uncertainty and the cosmic variance that we expect in different lines of sight",
    ", we can conclude that the @xmath5 values for cb58 are consistent with those for qsos in the first two redshift bins .",
    "however , we notice that the mean depression in cb58 is appreciably larger than expected from qsos in the last redshift bin . in the last redshift bin of cb58 we have @xmath10 at @xmath100 , while the best fit to qso sight lines gives @xmath101 at the same redshift ( kim et al .",
    ", 2001a ) , a @xmath14 effect .",
    "we notice that metal lines associated with cb58 could contribute to @xmath5 .",
    "this effect is marginally important in qso sight lines , because the powerful uv emission of qsos highly ionize the foreground gas of the host galaxy . to verify what this contribution is in cb58 ,",
    "we have compared its uv spectrum with the uv spectrum of a nearby galaxy .",

    "the rest frame overlapping range @xmath103   corresponds for cb58 to the observed interval @xmath104  .",
    "the rest frame of cb58 is calculated assuming a redshift of @xmath105 , that is the redshift of the strongest central absorbing cloud in its interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the absorption lines in ngc1705 show different contributions coming from the ism and high velocity clouds of the milky way , and the ism of ngc1705 itself , spanning a total velocity range of about 600  ( heckman et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "the strongest interstellar lines in ngc1705 , feii@xmath106 or ni@xmath107 , are also identified in cb58 .",
    "however , the involved column densities are about an order of magnitudes higher in cb58 .",
    "the strong absorption on the blue side of the feii complex , on the other hand , is due to the galactic ism , where metallicity and column densities are much larger .",
    "the strong siiv absorption doublet at @xmath108   and the ciii absorption line at @xmath109   in the spectrum ngc1705 are due to ob stars ( walborn & bohlin , 1996 ) . in cb58",
    "the absorption at @xmath110   can be identified with ciii absorption redshifted by about 300  with respect to the ism . the fitted profile shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] has been obtained assuming a width of 250  for this line , very similar to what observed for ngc1705 .",
    "the contribution of the siiv doublet in cb58 seems to be not very significant ( the first component is basically absent , while the second one is very weak ) . from unpublished hst / stis high resolution data of ngc1705 ( heckman , private communication ) we have seen that there are no other strong absorptions longward of the ciii feature in ngc1705 ,",
    "up to @xmath111  , corresponding to @xmath112   in the cb58 observed frame , so other further contributions to @xmath5 caused by the cb58 ism can be considered negligible .",
    "we have then recalculated @xmath5 in the last wavelength bin of the cb58 forest and excluded ciii absorption around @xmath113 and found @xmath114 .",
    "this is still significantly larger than what found in qsos and supports the idea that the excess of absorption at @xmath115 ( 150 @xmath15 mpc comoving from the galaxy ) is not due to the galaxy itself but is associated with the intervening intergalactic matter .",
    "the next comparison between lbg and qso forests is through the number density per unit redshift of  clouds with hi column density higher than a threshold @xmath116 .",
    "this eliminates the problem of the metal lines associated with cb58 .",
    "the number density per unit redshift is parameterized as @xmath117 . for a non  evolving population in the standard friedmann universe with null cosmological constant , @xmath118 and 0.5 for @xmath119 and 0.5 , respectively , whereas a non  evolving slope can be approximated by @xmath120 for a non - zero cosmological constant universe ( kim et al .",
    ". recent work on qso sight lines at different redshifts has shown that strong  clouds ( @xmath121 atoms 2 ) evolve at high redshift ( @xmath122 for @xmath123 , kim et al . , 2001a ) followed by a flat distribution at redshifts @xmath124 ( @xmath125 , hst key program , weymann et al .",

    "consistent with no evolution .",
    "tracking the number density evolution has implied a comparison of low resolution with high resolution data .",
    "this complicates the interpretation ; however , the results are quite striking .",
    "the number density evolution is different for different @xmath116 , being flatter at smaller @xmath116 for the large @xmath52 range ( penton et al . ,",

    "in cb58 we have calculated @xmath6 dividing the redshift interval in three different redshift bins as done in the previous section to calculate @xmath5 .",
    "we also consider two different @xmath116 , namely , @xmath126 and @xmath127 atoms 2 .",
    "this is because the completeness of the  sample varies along the spectrum of cb58 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath128 completeness of hi column densities obtained from  lines with doppler parameter in the range 20  @xmath129 , is @xmath130 , and @xmath127 atoms 2   for @xmath131 , and 4150  , respectively .",
    "the limited resolution and s / n have the consequence of underestimating the number of components observed in the absorption profile and overestimating the hi column density .",
    "in other words , for low or high @xmath116 , the number of detected clouds is underestimated or overestimated , respectively . in tables",

    "the deviation is in both cases significant at the @xmath146 level .",
    "the large  absorption and some metal lines associated with cb58 prevent us to detect  intervening clouds for redshift larger than @xmath147 , so we can not exclude the possibility that this high density region is more extended .",
    "we now have two possible scenarios , depending on the size of the region associated with this excess .",
    "\\1 ) the excess is due to the presence of a super cluster of  clouds not associated with cb58 .",
    "this super cluster of lines appears to be concentrated at @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) , corresponding to a region @xmath150 mpc comoving wide .",
    "this is an interesting possibility in view of the fact that a very large structure on scales @xmath151 or @xmath152 mpc has been found at @xmath153 in the lbg galaxy distribution ( steidel et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "steidel et al .  also suggest that similar clustering is common in lbg surveys and that lbgs represent the progenitors of local massive galaxies .",
    "\\2 ) the excess is due to high - density gas associated with the environment of cb58 . in this case",
    ", this high density region could extend all the way down to the galaxy .",
    "this has interesting implications for the proximity effect .",
    "the proximity effect is used to measure the intensity of the uv background radiation , assuming that the gas distribution of the igm is independent of the distance from qsos .",
    "our findings seem to undermine this assumption , which has also been questioned by pascarelle et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , using a completely different approach .",
    "these authors have analyzed the clustering properties of galaxies and qso absorption line pairs at low redshifts ( @xmath154 ) and found that galaxies and  clouds cluster around qsos .",
    "this effect extends up to a velocity range from the qso of @xmath155 . in cb58",
    "the clustering would be extended down to @xmath115 ( @xmath156 ) , corresponding to a velocity range of @xmath157 .",
    "we can imagine that a clustering effect similar to that found by pascarelle et al .",
    "( 2001 ) may occur in star forming lyman break galaxies , such as cb58 .",
    "indeed , its rest frame optical emission lines give an amplified star formation rate ( sfr ) of 620 m@xmath158 per year ( teplitz et al . , 2000 ) , which becomes @xmath159 m@xmath158 per year if corrected by the amplification factor of @xmath160 .",
    "if cb58 is a starburst galaxy , as suggested by its sfr , then a large density of starforming galaxies is expected in its environment , and therefore a large number of absorbing clouds as well , consistent with our findings .",
    "further evidence of the peculiarity of cb58 is given by the large velocity range shown by its components : the ism absorption ( @xmath105 ) and the emission lines ( @xmath161 ) are spread over almost 1000 .",
    "if the excess found around cb58 is typical in collapsed objects , the qso proximity effect has been underestimated so far and therefore the intensity of the uv background is overestimated .",
    "this , in turn , has important implications for estimates of the contribution of the lyman@xmath4 forest to the barionic content of the universe .    to assess the general validity of our results in other lbg forests ,",
    "it is necessary to analyze other good quality lbg spectra .",
    "this relies on the chance that other gravitationally lensed lbgs are discovered , hopefully with a magnification factor larger than that of cb58 .",
    "an alternative solution to study the intrinsic properties of high redshift galaxies and the intervening igm clouds can be provided by grb afterglow observations .",
    "grb afterglows have been found up to redshifts of 4.5 and their optical magnitude can be as bright as 15@xmath162 magnitude .",
    "these are perfect candidates for high resolution spectroscopy , provided that they are promptly targeted soon after the burst .",

    "<S> the high redshift galaxy ms1512cb58 ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) has been observed with the very efficient high resolution echelle spectrograph vlt / uves . </S>",
    "<S> although this is a very challenging observational program for a southern hemisphere telescope ( the galaxy is located at @xmath2 declination ) , high resolution spectra ( fwhm @xmath3 ) have revealed , with unprecedented detail along a galaxy sight line , the lyman@xmath4 forest due to intervening clouds in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the mean depression @xmath5 due to igm absorption blueward of the galaxy  wavelength and the number density @xmath6 of  clouds have been compared with equivalent results obtained for qso sight lines at similar redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate a possible excess of absorption close to the galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> the mean depression at @xmath7 mpc comoving ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) from the galaxy is @xmath10 , to be compared with @xmath11 , expected from a best fit to qso sight lines . in the same region ( @xmath12 ) , the number density of lines with hi column density in excess of @xmath13 atoms 2 is also @xmath14 larger than expected . </S>",
    "<S> this high density region is at least 60 @xmath15 mpc comoving wide , but the large  absorption of the galaxy itself prevents us from detecting a possible structure extending down to the galaxy .    </S>",
    "<S> this excess of  clouds is suggestive of two possible scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> one is the presence of a super cluster of  clouds not associated with cb58 . </S>",
    "<S> the other is a high density of gas associated with the environment of cb58 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a hint of the complexity of cb58 and possibly its environment is given by the huge velocity range ( almost 1000 ) between the optical emission of star forming regions and uv absorption of its interstellar medium .    </S>",
