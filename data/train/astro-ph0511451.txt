    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) detectable in galaxy clusters has emerged as a powerful new probe of the low to intermediate redshift universe ( see articles by birkinshaw & rephaeli in this volume , as well the review by carlstrom , et al .",
    "@xcite . within the prevailing theory of cosmological structure formation , galaxy clusters form in rare , massive peaks of the cosmic density field .",
    "because of natural biasing , such regions get a `` head start '' on structure formation on all scales smaller than the cluster scale . as a consequence ,",
    "galaxy clusters at the present epoch contain the oldest objects in the universe in an evolutionary sense @xcite .",
    "this makes galaxy clusters intrinsically interesting as astrophysical objects , worthy of study observationally , theoretically , and computationally .",
    "however , much of the current interest stems from the potential use of galaxy clusters as cosmological probes . as discussed in more detail below , the space density of galaxy clusters as a function of cosmological redshift is sensitive to the rms mass fluctuations on scales of 10@xmath0 , which depends on @xmath1 , the mean mass density of the universe , and to a lesser extent , @xmath2 , the dark energy density of the universe .",
    "attempts to deduce @xmath1 based on x - ray surveys have met with some success @xcite , but they have been hampered by the fact that at these wavebands cluster samples become sparse at z@xmath31 owing to their low surface brightness . because the sze is intrinsically redshift independent , one has the possibility of detecting clusters over a wide range of redshifts .",
    "blind surveys with sufficient sensitivity can in principle detect clusters from z=0 to their formation redshift @xmath4 @xcite , paving the way for more precise cosmological parameter measurements .",
    "follow - up pointed observations of a large sample of galaxy clusters over a range of redshifts would enable a detailed study of their formation and evolution .",
    "such studies would confirm or modify our theory of structure formation , improve our understanding of galaxy evolution , and reveal a great deal about the complex physical processes operating in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "this paper summarizes four lectures the author delivered at the varenna summer school entitled `` background microwave radiation and intracluster cosmology '' , held july 2004 in varenna , italy .",
    "originally , the organizers asked me to deliver three lectures covering numerical simulations of galaxy clusters , as well as to review the basics of cosmological structure formation , of which galaxy clusters are just one aspect .",
    "the first lecture of the school was to have been given by dr .",
    "rocky kolb on the cosmological standard model and the linear growth of density perturbations .",
    "when he was unable to attend the school , that responsibility fell to me , increasing my task to four lectures . fortunately , dr .",
    "kolb s lecture slides were made available to me , which i used verbatim .",
    "the following section 2 follows closely the content and organization of dr .",
    "kolb s lecture notes , while sections 3 - 5 are my own .",
    "section 3 reviews key concepts and results from structure formation theory that provide the vocabulary and framework for interpreting observations and simulations of galaxy clusters .",
    "section 4 discusses the technical challenges associated with simulating gas in galaxy clusters and reviews the numerical methods we have employed .",
    "section 5 presents results of numerical simulations of statistical ensembles of galaxy glusters whose goal is to understand how observables such as x - ray luminosity , emission - weighted temperature , and sze depend on cluster mass and baryonic physics .    in line with the character of the summer school ,",
    "i have attempted to be pedagogical , emphasizing the key concepts and results that a student needs to know if he / she wants to understand the current literature or do research in this area .",
    "literature citations are kept to a minimum , except for textbooks , reviews , and research papers that i found to be particularly helpful in preparing this article .",
    "our modern theory of the structure and evolution of the universe , along with the observational data which support it , is admirably presented in a recent textbook by dodelson @xcite .",
    "remarkable observational progress has been made in the past two decades which has strengthened our confidence in the correctness of the hot , relativistic , expanding universe model ( big bang ) , has measured the universe s present mass - energy contents and kinematics , and lent strong support to the notion of a very early , inflationary phase .",
    "moreover , observations of high redshift supernovae unexpectedly have revealed that the cosmic expansion is accelerating at the present time , implying the existence of a pervasive , dark energy field with negative pressure @xcite .",
    "this surprising discovery has enlivened observational efforts to accurately measure the cosmological parameters over as large a fraction of the age of the universe as possible , especially over the redshift interval 0 @xmath5 z @xmath5 1.5 which , according to current estimates , spans the deceleration - acceleration transition .",
    "these efforts include large surveys of galaxy large scale structure , galaxy clusters , weak lensing , the lyman alpha forest , and high redshift supernovae , all of which span the relevant redshift range . except for the supernovae ,",
    "all other techniques rely on measurements of cosmological structure in order to deduce cosmological parameters .",
    "the dynamics of the expanding universe is described by the two friedmann equations derived from einstein s theory of general relativity under the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy .",
    "the expansion rate at time @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the hubble parameter and @xmath9 is the frw scale factor at time @xmath6 . the first term on the rhs is proportional to the sum over all energy densities in the universe @xmath10 including baryons , photons , neutrinos , dark matter and dark energy .",
    "we have explicitly pulled the dark energy term out of the sum and placed it in the third term assuming it is a constant ( the cosmological constant ) .",
    "the second term is the curvature term , where @xmath11 for zero , positive , negative curvature , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can be cast in a form useful for numerical integration if we introduce @xmath12 parameters : @xmath13 dividing equation ( [ eq1 ] ) by @xmath14 we get the sum rule 1=@xmath15 , which is true at all times , where @xmath1 is the sum over all @xmath16 excluding dark energy . at the present time @xmath17 , and cosmological density parameters",
    "become @xmath18 equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can then be manipulated into the form @xmath19^{1/2}\\ ] ] here we have explicitly introduced a density parameter for the background radiation field @xmath20 and used the fact that matter and radiation densities scale as a@xmath21 and a@xmath22 , respectively , and we have used the sum rule to eliminate @xmath23 . equation ( [ eq4 ] ) is equation ( [ eq1 ] ) expressed in terms of the _ current _ values of the density and hubble parameters , and makes explicit the scale factor dependence of the various contributions to the expansion rate . in particular , it is clear that the expansion rate is dominated first by radiation , then by matter , and finally by the cosmological constant .",
    "current measurements of the cosmological parameters by different techniques @xcite yield the following numbers [ ( 0 ) notation suppressed ] : @xmath24 this set of parameters is referred to as the concordance model @xcite , and describes a spatially flat , low matter density , high dark energy density universe in which baryons , neutrinos , and photons make a negligible contribution to the large scale dynamics .",
    "most of the matter in the universe is cold dark matter ( cdm ) whose dynamics is discussed below .",
    "as we will also see below , baryons and photons make an important contribution to shaping of the matter power spectrum despite their small contribution to the present - day energy budget .",
    "understanding the evolution of baryons in nonlinear structure formation is essential to interpret x - ray and sze observations of galaxy clusters .",
    "the second friedmann equation relates the second time derivative of the scale factor to the cosmic pressure @xmath25 and energy density _ @xmath26 _ @xmath27 @xmath28 and @xmath26 are related by an equation of state @xmath29 , with @xmath30=0 , @xmath31=1/3 , and @xmath32 .",

    "the acceleration began when @xmath36 or @xmath37 .",
    "cosmic structure results from the amplification of primordial density fluctuations by gravitational instability .",
    "the power spectrum of matter density fluctuations has now been measured with considerable accuracy across roughly four decades in scale .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the latest results , taken from reference @xcite .",
    "combined in this figure are measurements using cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies , galaxy large scale structure , weak lensing of galaxy shapes , and the lyman alpha forest , in order of decreasing comoving wavelength .",
    "in addition , there is a single data point for galaxy clusters , whose current space density measures the amplitude of the power spectrum on 8 h@xmath38 mpc scales @xcite .",
    "superimposed on the data is the predicted @xmath39cdm linear power spectrum at z=0 for the concordance model parameters .",
    "as one can see , the fit is quite good .",
    "in actuality , the concordance model parameters are determined by fitting the data .",
    "a rather complex statistical machinery underlies the determination of cosmological parameters , and is discussed in dodelson ( 2003 , ch .",
    "the fact that modern cmb and lss data agree over a substantial region of overlap gives us confidence in the correctness of the concordance model . in this section , we define the power spectrum mathematically , and review the basic physics which determines its shape .",
    "readers wishing a more in depth treatment are referred to references @xcite .",
    "cdm model is shown as a solid line . from @xcite.,width=398,height=364 ]    at any epoch @xmath6 ( or @xmath40 or @xmath41 express the matter density in the universe in terms of a mean density and a local fluctuation : @xmath42 where @xmath43is the density contrast .",
    "expand @xmath44 in fourier modes : @xmath45 the autocorrelation function of @xmath43 defines the power spectrum through the relations @xmath46 where we have the definitions @xmath47 the quantity @xmath48 is called the dimensionless power spectrum and is an important function in the theory of structure formation . @xmath49 measures the contribution of perturbations per unit logarithmic interval at wavenumber @xmath50 to the variance in the matter density fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath39cdm power spectrum asymptotes to @xmath51 for small @xmath50 , and @xmath52 for large @xmath50 , with a peak a @xmath53 h mpc@xmath38 corresponding to @xmath54350 h@xmath38 mpc .",
    "@xmath48 is thus asymptotically flat at high @xmath50 , but drops off as @xmath55 at small @xmath50 .",
    "we therefore see that most of the variance in the cosmic density field in the universe at the present epoch is on scales @xmath56        what is the origin of the power spectrum shape ? here we review the basic ideas . within the inflationary paradigm , it is believed that quantum mechanical ( qm ) fluctuations in the very early universe were stretched to macroscopic scales by the large expansion factor the universe underwent during inflation .",
    "since qm fluctuations are random , the primordial density perturbations should be well described as a gaussian random field .",
    "measurements of the gaussianity of the cmb anisotropies @xcite have confirmed this .",
    "the primordial power spectrum is parameterized as a power law @xmath57 , with @xmath58 corresponding to scale - invariant spectrum proposed by harrison and zeldovich on the grounds that any other value would imply a preferred mass scale for fluctuations entering the hubble horizon .",
    "large angular scale cmb anisotropies measure the primordial power spectrum directly since they are superhorizon scale .",
    "observations with the wmap satellite are consistent with @xmath58 .",
    "to understand the origin of the spectrum , we need to understand how the amplitude of a fluctuation of fixed comoving wavelength @xmath59 grows with time . regardless of its wavelength",
    ", the fluctuation will pass through the hubble horizon as illustrated in fig .",
    "this is because the hubble radius grows linearly with time , while the proper wavelength a@xmath60 grows more slowly with time .",
    "it is easy to show from eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] that in the radiation - dominated era , @xmath61 , and in the matter - dominated era ( prior to the onset of cosmic acceleration ) @xmath62 .",
    "thus , inevitably , a fluctuation will transition from superhorizon to subhorizon scale .",
    "we are interested in how the amplitude of the fluctuation evolves during these two phases . here",
    "we merely state the results of perturbation theory ( e.g. , dodelson 2003 , ch .",
    "c         +          to calculate the growth of superhorizon scale fluctuations requires general relativistic perturbation theory , while subhorizon scale perturbations can be analyzed using a newtonian jeans analysis .",
    "we are interested in scalar density perturbations , because these couple to the stress tensor of the matter - radiation field .",
    "vector perturbations ( e.g. , fluid turbulence ) are not sourced by the stress - tensor , and decay rapidly due to cosmic expansion .",
    "tensor perturbations are gravity waves , and also do not couple to the stress - tensor .",
    "a detailed analysis for the scalar perturbations yields the following results . in the , @xmath63 while in the , @xmath64 this is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where we consider two fluctuations of different comoving wavelengths , which we will call large and small .",
    "the large wavelength perturbation remains superhorizon through matter - radiation equality ( mre ) , and enters the horizon in the matter dominated era .",
    "its amplitude will grow as @xmath6 in the radiation dominated era , and as @xmath65 in the matter dominated era .",
    "it will continue to grow as @xmath65 after it becomes subhorizon scale .",
    "the small wavelength perturbation becomes subhorizon before mre .",
    "its amplitude will grow as @xmath6 while it is superhorizon scale , remain constant while it is subhorizon during the radiation dominated era , and then grow as @xmath65 during the matter - dominated era .",
    "armed with these results , we can understand what is meant by a scale - free primordial power spectrum ( the harrison - zeldovich power spectrum . )",
    "we are concerned with perturbation growth in the very early universe during the radiation dominated era .",
    "superhorizon scale perturbation amplitudes grow as @xmath6 , and then cease to grow after they have passed through the hubble horizon .",
    "we can define a hubble wave number @xmath66 fig .",
    "3a shows the primordial power spectrum at three instants in time for k@xmath5k@xmath67 .",
    "we see that the fluctuation amplitude at k = k@xmath67(t ) depends on primordial power spectrum slope n. the scale - free spectrum is the value of n such that @xmath68=constant for k@xmath3k@xmath67 .",
    "a simple analysis shows that this implies n=1 . since @xmath69",
    ", we then have @xmath70    in actuality , the power spectrum has a smooth maximum , rather than a peak as shown in fig .",
    "this smoothing is caused by the different rates of growth before and after matter - radiation equality .",
    "the transition from radiation to matter - dominated is not instantaneous .",
    "rather , the expansion rate of the universe changes smoothly through equality , as given by eq . 1 , and",
    "consequently so do the temporal growth rates .",
    "the position of the peak of the power spectrum is sensitive to the when the universe reached matter - radiation equality , and hence is a probe of @xmath71 .",
    "once a fluctuation becomes sub - horizon , dissipative processes modify the shape of the power spectrum in a scale - dependent way .",
    "collisionless matter will freely stream out of overdense regions and smooth out the inhomogeneities .",
    "the faster the particle , the larger its free streaming length .",
    "particles which are relativistic at mre , such as light neutrinos , are called hot dark matter ( hdm ) .",
    "they have a large free - streaming length , and consequently damp the power spectrum over a large range of k. weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) which are nonrelativistic at mre , are called cold dark matter ( cdm ) , and modify the power spectrum very little ( fig . [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "baryons are tightly coupled to the radiation field by electron scattering prior to recombination . during rcombination",
    ", the photon mean - free path becomes large .",
    "as photons stream out of dense regions , they drag baryons along , erasing density fluctuations on small scales . this process is called silk damping , and results in damped oscillations of the baryon - photon fluid once they become subhorizon scale .",
    "the magnitude of this effect is sensitive to the ratio of baryons to collisionless matter , as shown in fig .",
    "here we introduce a few concepts and analytic results from the theory of structure formation which underly the use of galaxy clusters as cosmological probes . these provide us with the vocabulary which pervades the literature on analytic and numerical models of galaxy cluster evolution .",

    "both super- and sub - horizon scale perturbations grow as @xmath65 in the matter - dominated era .",
    "this means that after recombination , the linear power spectrum retains its shape while its amplitude grows as @xmath72 before the onset of cosmic acceleration . when @xmath48 for a given k approaches unity linear theory no longer applies , and some other method must be used to determine the fluctuation s growth . in general , numerical simulations are required to model the nonlinear phase of growth because in the nonlinear regime , the modes do not grow independently .",

    "conventionally , one defines the nonlinear wavenumber such that @xmath74 from this one can derive a nonlinear mass scale @xmath75 .",
    "a more useful and rigorous definition of the nonlinear mass scale comes from evaluating the amplitude of mass fluctuations within spheres or radius r at epoch z. the enclosed mass is @xmath76 the mean square mass fluctuations ( variance ) is @xmath77 where w is the fourier transform of the top - hat window function @xmath78/(kr)^2 . \\\\",

    "recently is has been shown both in simulations ( loken et al .",

    "improved mass estimates can be obtained by geometric deprojection of the x - ray and sze profiles if one knows the temperature of each radial shell .",
    "this is provided by the utp .",
    "for example , the x - ray surface brightness can be deprojected to yield the x - ray emissivity in each spherical shell ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "knowing the temperature profile , once can obtain the mass in each shell .",
    "a similar technique can be applied to the sze profile . by summing over shells ,",
    "one obtains the gas mass within the fitting radius .",
    "mass estimates obtained in this way we refer to as x - ray utp and sze - utp .     for full sff cluster sample ( triangles ) and cleaned sff sample ( diamonds ) at z=0 for each of four methods : utp - x - ray ( u - x ) , utp - sze ( u - sz ) , isothermal x - ray ( i - x ) , and isothermal sze ( i - sz ) as descibed in the text . from @xcite.,width=384,height=240 ]    fig .",

    "the error bars enclose the 80% confidence range . as can be seen",
    ", cleaning the sample reduces the scatter considerably . among the different methods , the x - ray measurements yield the smallest scatter , but overestimate the cluster masses by 5 - 10% .",
    "conversely , the sze - utp measurements yield unbiased estimates the cluster mass , with somewhat more scatter . as shown in @xcite , the scatter in the sze estimates decreases as the fitting radius",
    "is increased to @xmath245 , while no improvement is seen in the x - ray estimates .",
    "this is to be expected since the x - ray emission is heavily core - weighted , while the sze samples larger radii .",
    "we have seen that galaxy clusters are sensitive cosmological probes provided their masses can be measured with precision . both analytic estimates and numerical simulations show that the evolution of their comoving number density is sensitive to cosmology . with improvements in x - ray observations and impending large area surveys to detect clusters via the sze ,",
    "it is paramount to assess the accuracy to which cluster masses can be obtained observationally .",
    "based on our catalogs of simulated clusters using adaptive mesh refinement , we find that gas masses can be measured to @xmath14810% accuracy with 80% confidence .",
    "our study ignores instrumental or other observational effects .",
    "these limits in precision are a direct result of the deviation of the simulated clusters from simple assumptions about their physical and thermodynamic properties , dynamical state , and sphericity . comparing a variety of methods",
    ", we find that sze methods assuming a utp produce the smallest scatter when estimating masses from a raw sample of clusters .",
    "cleaning the cluster sample of obvious mergers does not improve the sze estimates much , but improves the x - ray estimates substantially . as a practical matter , we find sze methods are superior for mass estimation of large samples of clusters out to high redshift .",
    "this is particularly true if the cutoff radius is the virial radius , as this has the effect of smoothing out any boosting effects in the cluster core due to mergers .    comparing mass estimates from our four catalogs",
    ", we find that our conclusions are insensitive to assumed baryonic physics , except for the cooling sample , which yields unrealistic - looking clusters .",
    "mass estimates derived from the cooling sample are systematically high ( 50 - 100% ) despite excising the overluminous x - ray core .",
