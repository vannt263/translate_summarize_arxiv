    "<S> we study the formation of singularities for the mean curvature flow of monotone lagrangians in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we show that if singularities happen before a critical time then the tangent flow can be decomposed into a finite union of area - minimizing lagrangian cones ( slag cones ) . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath1 , we can improve this result by showing that connected components of the rescaled flow converge to an area - minimizing cone , as opposed to possible non - area minimizing union of slag cones . in the last section , </S>",
    "<S> we give specific examples for which such singularity formation occurs .    </S>",
