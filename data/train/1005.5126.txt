    "in particular , the cores of massive galaxy clusters are galaxy graveyards full of massive spheroidal systems that are dominated by old stellar populations . however , as we approach the epoch when these quiescent behemoths should be forming the bulk of their stars ( @xmath17 ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "observations of field galaxies at @xmath18 indicate that the star formation - density relation turns over at this epoch such that there is an enhancement of activity in the highest density regions of the field @xcite .",
    "studies also find an excess of dust - obscured star formation in group environments at @xmath16 @xcite , and very recent results suggest that star formation may be enhanced in the significantly richer core of a galaxy cluster at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "as cluster surveys push to higher redshifts ( @xmath20 ) and thus closer to the epoch when massive galaxies are forming their stars , variations in age will become evident in , e.g. a larger scatter in color , and robust star formation rates should reveal increasing levels of activity even in the cluster cores .",
    "we report here the first confirmation of increasing star formation activity with increasing galaxy density observed in cluster clg j0218.3 - 05101 , a spitzer - selected galaxy cluster at @xmath0 ( * ? ? ?",

    ", we find that two of the @xmath3 m  detected members do have emission at @xmath68 m ( irac channel 4 ) that deviates from the stellar fit , i.e. have a power - law component indicative of an agn , and one of these galaxies is the most ir luminous member with @xmath69l@xmath70  [ l@xmath5]@xmath72 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_smass ] ) .",
    "however , studies find that most of the emission ( @xmath73% ) in ulirgs is due to star formation @xcite , thus these members are likely to have both strong star formation and an agn component .",
    "note that at @xmath0 , the @xmath74 m pah band lies partly in the @xmath3 m  channel . because part of the ir luminosity is due to star formation",

    "we stress that excluding the two candidate agn does not change the trend , and the robustness of this result is underscored by the fact that we see the same trend using the sed - derived rates . while studies of galaxies in the field at @xmath18 ( @xmath84  gal  mpc@xmath7 ) find that the star formation - density relation is beginning to turn over at this epoch @xcite , this is the first confirmation of such a reversal in the significantly higher density environment of galaxy clusters .",
    "the measured ir luminosities correspond to specific star formation rates ( star formation rate divided by stellar mass ; ssfr ) per gyr of @xmath85 : these active members can more than double their stellar masses in the next gyr ( by @xmath86 ) .",
