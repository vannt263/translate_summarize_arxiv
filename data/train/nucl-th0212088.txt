    "attempts for a general classification of halo states were started early in the development of the field , see e.g.  @xcite , and have recently led to the suggested definition of halo states @xcite as having more than 50% probability of being in a cluster configuration where more than 50% of this probability should be in a classically forbidden region .",
    "this definition is straightforward to apply for a two - body system , where one basically has to find the outer classical turning point in the radial motion .",
    "the three - body systems are more challenging @xcite and it is the purpose of this paper to discuss their possible modes of behaviour .    one obvious point that needs clarification is how to generalize the outer classical turning point , that also can be used @xcite to scale different halo systems so that e.g. nuclear and molecular halos can be compared in dimensionless units .",
    "for the interesting special case of efimov states a universal scaling property predicting one efimov state from the previous one has been developed , see @xcite .",
    "another point that has only been discussed briefly in the literature so far is how the transition from a three - body to a two - body state takes place as the binding potentials are changed @xcite .",
    "connected to this is the classification of possible three - body configurations into borromean @xcite , tango @xcite or other bound states .",
    "to clarify the principles we shall mainly consider systems where all particles are in relative @xmath0-waves , which dominate at large distances",
    ". results of more realistic calculations will also be given for @xmath1li and the hypertriton .",
    "there is naturally more variability in three - body systems than in two - body systems .",
    "the three two - body subsystems might all play a role in the asymptotic region , so even in the weak - binding limit we should expect several types of behaviour to be possible , even for the simplest case of only relative @xmath0-waves .",
    "systems with zero and one bound subsystem are called borromean and tango systems , respectively .    in a two - body system",
    "the classical turning points are found by equating the total energy and the potential energy . in principle",
    "we can generalize this to three particles in a specified quantum state described by the wave function @xmath2 and find the probability for being in the non - classical region as @xmath3 , where the integration is confined to regions with potential energy larger than the total energy",
    ". this will be much harder to calculate than for a two - body system and could therefore be a rather impractical condition .",
    "furthermore , we are not assured that the wavefunction will behave in a simple way in the non - classical region ; there might be configurations where one pair is in a forbidden region whereas the third particle is in an allowed region .",
    "we shall therefore here rather explore the possibility of generalizing the classical turning point into a three - body scaling radius and discuss two different types of `` derivation '' of it .",
    "we use hyperspherical coordinates to describe the relative motion of three particles with masses @xmath4 , where @xmath5 .",
    "the total mass is @xmath6 , the individual momenta and coordinates are @xmath7 and @xmath8 and the hyperradius @xmath9 is defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the center of mass coordinate and @xmath12 is a mass unit chosen for convenience .",
    "the hyperradius is an average radius coordinate , applicable to all three - body systems and useful for all angular momenta and for non - spherical systems .",
    "the total mean square radius @xmath13 is then via the particle sizes @xmath14 given by @xmath15 it is natural to choose a three - body scaling radius @xmath16 so that the arbitrary mass @xmath12 enters in the same way in @xmath9 and @xmath16 and all measures of size , that typically rely on their ratio , become independent of @xmath12",
    ". the two - body scaling property relating size and binding energy can then be generalized if @xmath17 is an almost single - valued function of another dimensionless quantities @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the three - body binding energy @xcite .",
    "such a scaling property is clearly an advantage when searching for a general definition of the scaling radius @xmath16 .",
    "the relation should apply for systems consisting of particles with widely different masses and ranges of interactions .",
    "a tempting definition of @xmath16 is to maintain the complete analogy to @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath20 where @xmath21 is interpreted as the equivalent square well radius of the system consisting of particle @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "as argued in @xcite this definition is convenient in descriptions of three - body systems intermediate between two and three - body scaling .",
    "the choice of hyperspherical coordinates leads to effective radial potentials obtained by adiabatic expansion or by averaging in other ways over the remaining set of angular coordinates . the classically allowed regions for such one - dimensional potentials are easily defined .",
    "however , they could be completely different from the regions where the three pairs of particles are located in their classically allowed regions defined by the corresponding two - body potentials .",
    "in fact , it is entirely possible to have classical motion in the hyperradial coordinate while the system is in non - classical regions in real space .",
    "hyperradial turning points are therefore useless as definitions of quantum halos and often without any resemblance to the length unit @xmath16 defined above in terms of two - body properties .",
    "it is instructive to consider the general behaviour of the hyperradial potential . for zero - range two - body potentials",
    "the only energy available through combination of parameters is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a combination of reduced masses . with this large distance behaviour",
    "any number of solutions is possible , ranging from zero to the infinitely many efimov states . for finite range interactions the ranges or",
    "alternatively the scattering lengths provide additional length parameters and the hyperradial potentials could approach zero faster than @xmath26 .    from @xcite",
    "we obtain the large distance behaviour of the dominating lowest @xmath0-wave adiabatic potential as @xmath27 where the reduced mass is @xmath28 , the @xmath0-wave scattering length is @xmath29 and the average scattering length is defined as @xmath30 the chosen normalization reduces @xmath31 to the common @xmath29 when all three particles are identical .",
    "thus the large distance behavior of @xmath32 in eq.([e66 ] ) is @xmath33 which is reached when @xmath9 is comparable to @xmath34 , see @xcite .",
    "scaling can be shown analytically to occur for the special case of a @xmath35 wavefunction ( @xmath36 being the hypermoment ) for square well two - body potentials of depth @xmath37 and radius @xmath21 . here",
    "the effective hyperradial potential @xmath38 can be obtained @xcite as @xmath39 which is valid when @xmath9 is several times larger than any of the square well radii .",
    "the square well two - body @xmath0-wave scattering length is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the zero energy wave number inside the square well , i.e @xmath42 .",
    "then @xmath43 is a specific function of @xmath44 , which approaches the constant @xmath45 when @xmath29 becomes much larger than @xmath21 .",
    "thus the effective radial potential in eq.([e36 ] ) approaches the form @xmath46 where the definition of @xmath16 , @xmath47 reduces to that of eq.([e22 ] ) for identical masses and radii . note that eq.([e56 ] ) , in contrast to eq.([e22 ] ) , employs a linear ( not squared ) summation . for systems where the two - body scattering lengths are large",
    ", most of the wavefunction will reside in the region where eq.([e46 ] ) holds for @xmath35 and one clearly has scaling .",
    "a desirable property of the scaling radius @xmath16 would be that classically forbidden regions on average are given roughly by @xmath48 .",
    "we can consider this question briefly for the specific @xmath35 solutions , where the probability @xmath49 for particles @xmath22 and @xmath23 being inside their square well radius @xmath21 for large @xmath9 is @xmath50 this probability is 1/2 for @xmath51 which indicates that systems reside mainly in classically forbidden regions if their mean square radii are somewhat larger than @xmath52 .",
    "we do not believe that the @xmath35 wave functions are realistic solutions for the weakly bound systems since they do not allow for any form of correlations between the particles .",
    "for very loosely bound systems where @xmath31 is much larger than @xmath16 the potential will fall off as @xmath26 between @xmath16 and @xmath31 , i.e.  slower than @xmath33 as for a pure @xmath35 solution .",
    "the scaling radius will be used to look for scaling properties of three - body systems in the weak binding limit .",
    "we are aiming for as universal properties as possible , but the rather different types of structure that occur in three - body systems means we first have to look at how they can be classified . in fig.[fig1 ] we illustrate the various stability regions as function of scattering lengths . at the border between tango and borromean regions",
    "one subsystem has a bound state with zero energy . on the thick horizontal line",
    "two identical subsystems have bound states of zero energy and the infinitely many efimov states arise .",
    "the figure only shows the region where @xmath53 , appropriate e.g.  when particles 1 and 2 are identical , but already indicates that two distinct types of transitions can occur as a function of @xmath54 , namely moving from the tango region ( the 23 and 13 subsystems are unbound ) from left to right either directly into unbound systems or through the borromean region . to see this in detail we now turn to the numerical results and show in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the region of weak binding for a number of both schematic and realistic examples . through eq.([e21 ] ) this scaling plot displays the mean square radius of the system in units of @xmath52 versus the dimensionless binding energy @xmath55 @xcite , where @xmath19 is the three - body binding energy .",
    "zero binding energy corresponds to three non - interacting particles at rest .",
    "we shall in this letter use the scaling radius defined in eq.([e56 ] ) , where @xmath21 is the radius of the square well with the same scattering length and effective range as the actual two - body potential .",
    "changing to the other definition in eq.([e22 ] ) has essentially no effect on the hypertriton examples , whereas the different @xmath1li points move by about 30% .",
    "the resulting figure is practically indistinguishable from the present one , except that the perfect scaling for @xmath35 is violated slightly .",
    "there is no strong preference for any of these two definitions of @xmath16 .",
    "the first analysis in @xcite assumed that simple systems at least aymptotically would correspond to a single value of the hypermoment @xmath36 .",
    "we have artificially restricted the wavefunctions for different systems to contain only @xmath36=0 terms and find that these systems , as argued above , indeed do scale and lie on a single curve . however , the points corresponding to more realistic calculations lie above this @xmath36=0 curve and can be grouped and understood as follows .    in the realistic @xmath56h - structure the neutron and proton are almost in a deuteron configuration ( close circles ) whereas the @xmath57-particle is far outside but still bound by about 0.14  mev .",
    "thus this is a tango system and the large size is almost entirely due to the @xmath57-deuteron extension , i.e. of two - body character . by using a simplified form for the neutron - proton interaction with only @xmath0-waves the position is sligthly higher than the realistic point . by decreasing this neutron - proton attraction the binding decreases moderately while the radius drastically increases ( open circles ) .",
    "this off hand surprising property can be understood from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by moving horizontally from the tango region to the right , increasing @xmath58 . for sufficiently weak initial binding , i.e.  large values of @xmath59 , the threshold for @xmath57-deuteron binding",
    "is reached instead of the borromean region as we decrease the attraction of the only bound subsystem .",
    "thus the diverging radius is due to @xmath57-deuteron two - body threshold and not related to the neutron - proton threshold .",
    "decreasing the @xmath0-wave attraction between neutron and proton while maintaining all other parts of the realistic interaction ( filled circles ) , now leads from tango into the borromean region of fig.[fig1 ] , i.e. the three - body system remains bound even after the neutron - proton potential is too weak to form a bound two - body state .",
    "the result is a completely different curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] much more in agreement with the logarithmic divergence expected from @xcite , although still significantly above the @xmath35 curve .",
    "we stress that nothing drastically happens at the arrow where the deuteron becomes unbound ( scaled binding energy about 0.08 ) .",
    "the realistic point for the borromean nucleus @xmath1li is at a scaled binding energy of 0.13 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . by decreasing the @xmath0-wave attraction in the neutron-@xmath60li systems , i.e.  going vertically upwards in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] approaching the threshold , the binding decreases and the radius increases corresponding to a logarithmically diverging curve in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( filled triangles ) eventually approaching that of the borromean hypertriton example .",
    "a similar behaviour is seen for a hypothetical hypertriton with only @xmath0-waves included ( filled squares ) but with a slightly increased nucleon-@xmath61 attraction .",
    "then we move horizontally from the tango to the borromean region . for a borromean system of three particles ( stars ) where the three masses and scattering lengths are equal or differ substantially",
    ", we again follow the same trajectory by changing one scattering length .    by increasing the @xmath0-wave attraction in the neutron-@xmath62li systems , i.e.  vertically approaching the efimov limit in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , larger binding and smaller radius result as expected .",
    "the resulting non - borromean @xmath1li ground state resembles more and more an ordinary nuclear state .",
    "however , at some point an excited state appears , i.e.  the first efimov state ( open triangles ) . at first",
    "it is very weakly bound and close to the efimov line .",
    "as the attraction and the three - body binding energy increases the size at first decrease and then `` turn around '' and increase again as the binding energy of the two bound two - body subsystems approach and finally overtake the three - body binding energy @xcite .",
    "as the two - body threshold is approached the third excited state ( second efimov state ) should appear on the dashed line .",
    "unfortunately the mass ratio ( neutron to @xmath60li ) is relatively small and the next state is many orders of magnitude outside the scale of the plot , i.e. outside the reach of experimental as well as most numerical techniques .",
    "one remaining question is the approach of the two sets of points , related to hypertriton and @xmath1li , at very small binding energy .",
    "both these sets arise by approach of ( different ) thresholds for borromean binding in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . when the majority of the radial wave function is located in the tail of the adiabatic potential in eq.([e66 ] ) then @xmath31 is a decisive length parameter . one could then erroneously be led to conclude that @xmath31 determines the size - binding relations and the threshold for borromean binding in fig .",
    "however , the absolute scale of the energy can not be determined from one parameter alone , the short distance behaviour is also indispensably necessary @xcite .    to understand this we imagine that we reduce the ranges of the potentials while increasing the strengths to maintain the scattering lengths .",
    "this zero - range limit results in the thomas collapse and infinitely many bound states at small distances @xcite . to avoid this unphysical behaviour some kind of renormalization is needed .",
    "the simplest is to maintain the large distance behavior while only using the two - body potentials down to a distance below which the structure is uninteresting .",
    "the two - body results can then be expressed in units of such a rather arbitrary length parameter .",
    "the effect on a three - body system can then be anticipated mimicked by a similar renormalization by use of a hyperspherical length unit .",
    "however , this is precisely the content of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where we used @xmath16 as the scale parameter .    the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] coinciding at small binding are therefore an almost universal curve as indicated by the convergence in the figure",
    ". it would perhaps be rather fortuitous if this simple renormalization procedure in hyperradius results in a universal rescaled curve .",
    "the average scattering lengths for the four cases in the weak binding limit vary from 4  fm to 20  fm whereas the ratio @xmath63 varies between 1.7 and 4.2 .",
    "however , @xmath31 only determines the adiabatic potential for distances smaller than the scattering lengths and larger than the potential ranges .",
    "these conditions are not well fulfilled for the examples in fig .",
    "thus constant @xmath63 should not necessarily arise , since @xmath31 should be replaced by a complicated function of all three @xmath29 .",
    "this is not contradicting the numerical results in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] which is obtained without use of @xmath31 .",
    "thus the emerging numerical curve is almost universal providing rather well defined scaling properties .",
    "three - body quantum halos were previously believed to appear along the @xmath35 curve @xcite .",
    "this conclusion was reached by omitting constant terms compared to the leading order logarithmically diverging term .",
    "however , the present more refined analysis reveals the correct higher lying universal curve approached in the weak binding limit .",
    "in fact asymptotically these curves differ by a constant factor . in any case",
    "three - body quantum halos can appear above the @xmath35 curve , i.e. allowed in a larger window and being a factor of 23 larger than expected .",
    "one implication is that @xmath35 wavefunctions can not be used in the weak binding limit due to the coherent large - distance contributions from more than one subsystem . for stronger binding a @xmath35 basis is simply incomplete .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ground state three - body halos appear just below the line separating the borromean from the unbound region . on top of this the efimov effect",
    "can also give `` super - halos '' in excited states .",
    "ground state two - body halos can appear just below the line separating the tango from the unbound region . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , three - body halos where the three - body dynamics dominate will appear on or below the ( almost ) universal curve .",
    "all systems falling above are influenced by an effective two - body threshold and correspond either to the efimov line ( caused by the threshold in two subsystems ) or the tango - unbound line in fig .",
    "we stress that all quantities used to place a system in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in principle can be measured experimentally and that our results therefore can be used to classify the three - body nature of realistic systems ."
