    "young protostars can be highly variable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the best known members of this club are the fu orionis objects , which are young stars showing very large ( factors of hundreds ) and abrupt increases in their brightness @xcite . observations of these objects are best understood as variability in the accretion rate onto the growing protostar from a base accretion rate state of @xmath1  yr@xmath2 to a high of up to @xmath3  yr@xmath2 .",
    "although detailed statistics is still lacking , the duration of the outbursts is believed to be in the range of tens to hundreds of years .",
    "clear spectroscopic signatures implicate an accretion disc in the inner @xmath4 au as the driver of this variable accretion rate and luminosity output @xcite .",
    "the rise times of the outbursts are very short , from a year to @xmath5 ten years .",
    "fu ori phenomenon is not just a fine detail of young stars evolution : the statistics of fu ori objects suggests that an average proto - star may experience 10 - 20 of such outbursts , which may still be considered a lower limit on the importance of the fu ori outbursts @xcite .",
    "it is not impossible that proto - stars accrete _ most _ of its mass during these relatively short but very intense growth episodes .",
    "a rather natural model for fu ori variables is a viscously and thermally unstable accretion disc that undergoes periodic switching between the stable quiescent and the outburst states ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hydrogen is mainly neutral in the quiescent state and is mainly ionised in the outburst state , partially explaining the large difference in the accretion rates . in detail , however , external triggering of the outbursts may still be desirable ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as the theoretically produced outburst rise time scales are longer than @xmath5 10 yrs .    the key deficiency of the pure thermal disc instability model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is in the fact that the unstable inner disc region is relatively small , e.g. , @xmath6 au @xcite .",
    "this produces outbursts that are too short , unless one uses very small values for the viscosity @xmath7-parameter , e.g. , as small as @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this seems to be unlikely @xcite .",
    "in addition , spectral modeling of the inner disc of the fu ori variables @xcite , and their nir interferometry @xcite , require the hot disc region to be greater than @xmath9 au , which is clearly too large for the pure thermal disc instability models @xcite .",
    "the small extent of the unstable region translates into too small a disc mass participating in the instability ( since the mass is set by the critical surface densities at which the instability operates ; * ? ? ?",
    "the disc instability model thus may be said to suffer from the `` mass and time - scale deficit problem '' as there is not enough mass in the disc to explain the observed long and bright fu ori outbursts .",
    "a very promising way forward to enlarging the unstable region , and thus solving the deficit problem , was proposed by @xcite .",
    "these authors pointed out that the intermediate disc region , @xmath10 au is expected to have a layered structure @xcite .",
    "the disc midplane region is shielded by the upper layers from the ionisation sources , and is likely to be too cold to support the magneto - rotational instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that would otherwise yield an efficient angular momentum transport .",
    "accretion thus proceeds only inside the upper ionised `` skin '' of the disc .",
    "bulk of the material is underneath the skin , too cold to flow radially , settling into what is called `` the dead zone '' . over time , and in the right range of external mass supply rates , the dead zone becomes very massive , e.g. , @xmath11 , which eventually triggers a gravitational instability . the associated gravito - turbulence @xcite initiates a rapid angular momentum transfer .",
    "@xcite obtained relatively bright , @xmath12 yr@xmath2 , outbursts lasting for as long as @xmath13 yrs .",
    "the current consensus is that the model of @xcite satisfies observational and physical constraints on fu ori outbursts better than any other ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    here",
    "we propose another solution to the inner disc mass deficit problem , which relies on an entirely different mass reservoir .",
    "we suggest that the material accreted onto the star during the fu ori outbursts comes from giant young planets that fill their roche lobes inside the inner 1 au from the star .",
    "the planets are assumed to be pushed inward closer to the star by gravitational torques of the protoplanetary disc .",
    "the significance of young planets as serious contenders on the role of mass donors for fu ori outbursts is easily appreciated .",
    "the mass of gaseous proto - planets may be as high as tens of jupiter masses ( @xmath14 ) , much higher than the likely disc mass in the inner fractions of an au .",
    "if the material of such a planet is dumped into the inner disc and then accreted onto the star at an accretion rate of @xmath15 yr@xmath2 , then there is enough gas for a @xmath16 yrs - long accretion outburst .",
    "our work is based on ideas of @xcite who pointed out that the early ( @xmath17 myr ) stages of the thermal relaxation of the planet are highly uncertain and model dependent ( see a fuller discussion of this in  [ sec : embryo_contraction ] ) .",
    "the `` low density start '' models of such planets are sufficiently fluffy to be tidally disrupted inside a fraction of an au .",
    "we shall also find important connections to the earlier work of @xcite who showed that a massive planet in the inner disc region can trigger rapid rise outbursts , as observed . finally , our calculations of young protoplanet disruptions are complimentary to the `` outburst accretion mode '' simulations of large ( @xmath18 au ) discs by @xcite .",
    "these authors have found that massive gaseous clumps born in their discs at @xmath16 au distances migrate inward quickly , being accreted by their inner boundary condition .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to investigate the process of tidal disruption of compact proto - planets in the inner @xmath19 au of the star in unison with a more self - consistent modeling of the protostellar disc evolution to probe the proposed link of young protoplanets to the fu ori outbursts . to model the disc",
    ", we use the standard @xcite 1d time - dependent viscous disc evolution equations in the presence of a massive embedded satellite . an approximate but well understood and tested type ii migration model",
    "is used to communicate the gravitational torques between the planet and the disc @xcite . in our modeling of the mass loss",
    ", we are aided by the well known results from semi - detached stellar binaries ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the structure of the paper and main results are the following . in  [ sec : analytical ] we build a simplified analytical theory for the mass loss and radial motion of the planet embedded in a proto - planetary disc .",
    "we show that due to conservation of angular momentum , a mass - transferring planet may migrate outward . repeating the well known stellar binary results",
    ", we also find that the mass transfer rate and the migration pattern can be a quasi - steady or run - away process that may end in a complete ( or nearly so ) destruction of the planet .",
    "we introduce our numerical methods in  [ sec : numerics ] . in  [",
    "sec : cd ] we present numerical experiments in which the outer disc is replaced by a constant external torque parameter .",
    "this allows us to test our simplified theory in a `` clean '' controlled setting . in ",
    "[ sec : full ] , simulations with a self - consistent disc evolution and torque on the planet are presented .",
    "a range of variability patterns is found there , and further expanded on in  [ sec : lc04 ] .",
    "the effective temperature profiles of our disc models are discussed in  [ sec : size ] . in  8 we summarise the main results of our paper .",
    "the numerical scheme presented in  [ sec : cd ] is well suited for studying tidal disruptions of planets in arbitrarily initialised time - dependent gas discs . here",
    "we attempt to build a simple analytical understanding of what to expect from numerical simulations later on .",
    "we start with the simplest possible situations and gradually add different physical effects . in this section , the outer accretion disc is only considered as a source of a given gravitational torque on the planet ( @xmath20 , cf .  2.3 ) affecting its radial motion . the inner disc interaction with the planet",
    "is described by the parameter @xmath21 introduced shortly below .",
    "we emphasise that @xmath20 and @xmath21 are only defined for convenience of our analytical study ( this section ) ; these parameters are replaced by a self - consistent treatment of the disc - planet torques in the time - dependent numerical calculation .",
    "a planet embedded in an accretion disc is a subject to gravitational torques from the surrounding discs that in general push it inward @xcite .",
    "here we point out that a mass - losing planet can push itself outward .",
    "operationally , the effect is due to a different balance between the inner and the outer disc torques than that in the standard no - mass - loss case ; however , the effect is best understood simply on the basis of angular momentum conservation in the star - planet system .",
    "consider a planet of mass @xmath22 orbiting the star of mass @xmath23 at a distance @xmath24 in a circular orbit .",
    "the planet s orbital angular momentum is given by @xmath25 if the planet fills its roche lobe and transfers mass inward through the lagrangian l1 point @xcite , the system is analogous to a semi - detached stellar binary system with an extreme mass ratio . in the case of conservative mass transfer , we have @xmath26 .",
    "we neglect the spin angular momentum of the planet as it is small compared to the orbital angular momentum .",
    "we first assume that the star s spin does not change as a result of gas accretion onto it , in which case the planet s angular momentum is conserved during the mass transfer process .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 this demonstrates that the planet migrates outward as it loses mass .",
    "this effect is well known in stellar binary evolution where a conservative mass exchange between the two components leads to widening of the orbit if the secondary is less massive than the primary , and shrinking of the orbit if mass is lost by the more massive star @xcite .    in a more general case",
    ", accretion of mass onto the star may spin up the star .",
    "alternatively , the star could be slowing down its rotation by passing angular momentum to the inner disc via magnetospheric torques @xcite . also ,",
    "as we shall see later , the angular momentum of the gas accreting onto the star may flow past the planet s orbit if the _ gap _ , which is generally opened in the disc by a massive planet , is closed .",
    "if the viscous time of the inner disc is long compared with the planet s mass loss timescale , then we should also account in equation [ dadt00 ] for the angular momentum stored in the disc . to continue with our analytical arguments below",
    ", we find it convenient to introduce a free parameter describing the efficiency of the outward migration due to mass transfer , @xmath28 : @xmath29 if the star is a sink of angular momentum , @xmath30 , but if it gives the angular momentum to the disc then @xmath21 may be larger than unity .",
    "we emphasise that , while introduced for convenience in the analytical considerations described here , @xmath21 is not a free parameter of our numerical simulations ( see section 3 below ) , since the outward torque on the planet due to the inner disc is calculated self - consistently .",
    "we only use @xmath21 in our analytical model below , and also for an interpretation of the numerical results in cases where we can make a good guess on the appropriate value of @xmath21 .      mass transfer from a roche lobe - filling secondary to the primary",
    "has been a subject of numerous papers in the context of cataclysmic binaries secular evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the main result of these studies is that the mass loss rate is a very strong function of @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the hills radius of the planet , which we set approximately equal to its roche lobe radius , and @xmath33 is the planet s radius .",
    "the mass loss rate is very small for negative @xmath34 , increasing rapidly for positive @xmath35 .",
    "these basic facts are in fact sufficient for the analytical treatment below , but we find it timely to introduce our numerical mass transfer scheme here as well , to emphasise the importance of the difference @xmath34 once more . before the roche lobe of the secondary is filled , @xmath36 , the mass transfer rate has an exponential form reflecting the exponential decrease of density with height in the stellar atmosphere ( cf .",
    "eq . 9 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath37\\ ; , \\label{dotm1}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the scale height of the planet s atmosphere , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the photosphere s density and sound speed , respectively .    when the roche lobe of the planet is filled , and @xmath41 , the mass transfer rate can be calculated in a similar way ( see section 1 of *",
    "* ) , and the result turns out to be dependent on whether the outer layers of the star are convective or radiative @xcite .",
    "for an isothermal atmosphere , @xmath42 $ ] , with @xmath43const , whereas for a convective star with polytropic index @xmath44 , the result is @xmath45 ( equation ( 1.27 ) in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "importantly , for any value of @xmath46 this function is strongly increasing with @xmath34 . for @xmath47 , for example , @xmath48 , whereas for molecular hydrogen , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . for definitiveness , we parametrise the mass flow rate through the l1 point as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ( internal ) dynamical time of the planet .",
    "note that when the planet fills its roche lobe , @xmath53 , and we can re - write equation [ dotm3 ] as @xmath54 where @xmath55(0.1 au ) . since the headline factor in equation [ dotm4 ] is so large , one obtains very high roche lobe overflow rates even for modest values of @xmath34 . for example , even at @xmath56 the overflow rate is about two order of magnitude larger than the mean accretion rate onto embedded protostars , @xmath57  yr@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "we found through experimenting with different power - law indexes in this dependence that the results are very insensitive to the exact form of the mass loss rate dependence on @xmath34 .",
    "this result is well known from stellar binary evolutionary calculations , and will be re - derived for the problem at hand below . physically , since the mass transfer rate is a strong function of @xmath34 , it turns out that the process is stable only if @xmath58 may be maintained very small , which is equivalent to requiring @xmath59 .",
    "in this situation the mass loss rate self - adjusts to satisfy the angular momentum loss or gain constraints ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "different mass loss formulations only yield slightly different values of @xmath35 at which the required equilibrium value of @xmath60 is achieved .    on the other hand , in cases where the mass transfer leads to @xmath61 shrinking faster than @xmath33 , or @xmath33 increasing faster than @xmath61 ,",
    "a runaway mass transfer occurs .",
    "one well known example of this in stellar binaries is the case where the secondary is more massive than the primary , in which case the separation of the components shrinks rather than increases as the mass is transferred @xcite . in this case",
    "the disruption of the companion is nearly dynamical , and therefore the exact form of the transfer rate is again not very important .",
    "we follow here the usual assumption that the planet s surface is determined by the equipotential surfaces ( e.g. ,  of * ? ? ?",
    "we also assume that the planet and the star are on circular orbits around the centre of mass of the system .",
    "the dimensionless potential in a frame corotating with the centre of mass of the star - planet system has two saddle points , l1 and l2 .",
    "the points lie on the line connecting the star and the planet , with l1 positioned between the planet and the star , and l2 further away `` behind '' the planet .    in stellar binaries ,",
    "the overflow of the secondary s roche lobe always proceeds via the lagrangian point l1 since it is much closer to the secondary .",
    "however , for the planet - star system , the mass ratio , @xmath62 , is very small , and thus the overflow may proceed via both l1 and l2 .",
    "we quantify this following the treatment given in  4.1 of @xcite .",
    "the difference between distances of the l1 and l2 points ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively ) from the centre of the planet are @xmath65 where @xmath66 ( see eq",
    ". 63 in * ? ? ?",
    "we see that the point l2 is distance @xmath67 further away from the centre of the planet than l1 .",
    "now , if the atmosphere s scaleheight @xmath38 were infinitely small , the overflow would only proceed via the l1 point ( if the planet overflow maintains the @xmath68 condition ) .",
    "however , if the atmosphere is extended enough , that is @xmath69 , then the outflow should proceed through both points l1 and l2 .",
    "equation ( 66 ) of @xcite shows that @xmath70 our models will characteristically assume that @xmath71 k ( see  [ sec : embryo_contraction ] below ) , and the planet - star separation at which the roche lobe overflow occurs is often @xmath72 au . for these fiducial parameters ,",
    "@xmath73 this shows that for massive young protoplanets , @xmath74 , the overflow should indeed proceed mainly via the l1 point , but as the planet s mass drops below @xmath75 both l1 and l2 can be letting the planet s atmosphere to escape .",
    "there is actually one further condition to check . in ",
    "[ sec : loss ] we have shown that the overflow rate is a strongly increasing function of @xmath35 . in the simulations below , we shall find relatively large roche lobe overflow rates , requiring small but not infinitesimally small values for @xmath76 .",
    "the difference between locations @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath67 , is also small in units of @xmath33 . for a large enough values of @xmath79 , it is possible that the required roche lobe `` overfilling '' , @xmath34 , is larger than @xmath67 .",
    "we expect that if @xmath80 , the overflow proceeds mainly via l1 as argued above , but if @xmath81 , both l1 and l2 will siphon gas away at comparable rates .",
    "to compare these , we note that for @xmath82 , @xmath83 . on the other hand ,",
    "the planet mass loss of @xmath84  yr@xmath2 requires @xmath85 .",
    "thus we see that , at least for @xmath82 the overflow should proceed mainly through the l1 point .",
    "in general , the ratio of the two length scales is @xmath86^{1/3 } \\ ; a_{0.1}^{1/2 } \\left({10 m_j \\over m_p}\\right)^{-5/6}\\;. \\label{r_over_d}\\ ] ] this shows that at the high mass loss rates the outflow proceeds via l1 point as long as @xmath87 ; at lower planet masses the outflow may occur via both l1 and l2 points .",
    "we conclude that in the most typical parameter space sampled by our models below , the roche lobe overflow occurs via the l1 point .",
    "however , for relatively low mass planets , @xmath88 , the overflow should take place via both l1 and l2 . in this paper",
    "we make an approximation that the outflow always occurs via l1 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath34 is of primary interest to us here .",
    "let us calculate the full time derivatives of the hill ( roche ) radius and the planet radius : @xmath89 and @xmath90 respectively . here",
    ", @xmath91 is the adiabatic mass - radius exponent of the planet , discussed below , and @xmath92 is the time derivative of planet s radius due to thermal relaxation , e.g. , radiative cooling of the planet .",
    "similarly , @xmath93 is the rate of hills radius change due to planet s mass changing , and @xmath94 is the term due to external torques onto the planet in the absence of the mass loss .",
    "since @xmath95 , and in view of equation [ dadt0 ] , @xmath96 where we neglected the small term @xmath97 .",
    "further , we introduce the following notations for brevity @xmath98",
    "@xmath99 @xmath100    the mass - radius relation for a polytropic planet is given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the polytrope s index , and @xmath44 is the ratio of the specific heats for the planet s gas .",
    "it is noteworthy that the radius - mass relation for a polytrope strongly depends on @xmath44 , and that the polytropic cloud usually ( for large enough values of @xmath44 ) expands as the mass is lost .",
    "for example , for @xmath47 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104 ; for @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "note that @xmath108 can be related to the external torque , @xmath109 , on the planet .",
    "here we anticipate that in our model situation the external torque is negative , @xmath110 , pushing the planet closer to the star .",
    "to relate @xmath108 and @xmath109 , note that angular momentum conservation in the absence of mass loss yields @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a specific angular momentum of the planet .",
    "from which we conclude that @xmath113    note also that @xmath114 is negative for a planet contracting as the result of radiative cooling and it is positive for a planet expanding with time at a constant mass .",
    "the latter situation may occur when the planet s interior is heated by the solid core accretion luminosity @xcite , or due to dissipation of tides induced by the parent star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , irradiation @xcite .      in accord with",
    "our plan to progress from simple to more complex we first study a non - cooling planet without external torques , i.e. , @xmath115 , which has @xmath116 , i.e. , transfers mass onto the star at some non - zero rate , @xmath117 . as far as realistic planets in massive gas discs are concerned , this model situation is of an academic interest , as one needs external torques or internal evolution of the planet ( e.g. , planet swelling due to internal or tidal heating ) to fill its roche lobe , but it will be seen to provide important hints to the results of the more realistic numerical experiments later on .    following the discussion in  [ sec : loss ] , the dominant factor in the mass loss rate dependence is the difference @xmath118 .",
    "write @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a positive and monotonically increasing function of its argument ( note that @xmath121 ) .",
    "we have explicitly neglected here the much slower dependence of the mass transfer rate on other variables ( such as the photosphere s temperature and the density in equation [ dotm1 ] ) . within this approximation , we have , @xmath122 where @xmath123 .",
    "since at the onset of the mass transfer @xmath59 , @xmath124 referring now to equations [ drh_dt ] , [ drp_dt ] , and definitions [ zetah ] , [ zetap ] , we find that @xmath125    it is now apparent that the stability of the mass transfer rate is determined by the sign of @xmath126 since @xmath127 . if this term is negative , the mass loss rate increases exponentially with time .",
    "thus , the mass loss is unstable if @xmath128 where we used equation [ zetah ] .",
    "this relation demonstrates that stability of the mass loss process is decided by the mass - radius relation for the planet , and by the angular momentum transfer between the planet and the star ( the factor @xmath21 ) .",
    "physically , this is because the planet moves outward as the result of the mass transfer , which increases @xmath61 .",
    "however , the planet may also increase in size due to mass loss .",
    "when the condition ( [ unstable ] ) is satisfied , @xmath33 increases faster than @xmath61 as the planet siphons away its mass . in this case , once the planet filled its roche lobe ( hill s radius ) , the mass loss process is a runaway one .    the opposite situation , @xmath129 , is stable . in the presently considered case of zero external torques and no cooling , the mass loss rate drops exponentially with time .",
    "the physics of this is simple  the planet moves outward and eventually it becomes smaller than its roche lobe . in a more realistic situation where there are non - zero external torques ,",
    "a steady - state situation can be set up , where the planet moves radially at just the right rate to maintain the balance @xmath59 .",
    "clearly , the stability of the mass transfer is strongly dependent both on the details of the evolution of the planet s angular momentum ( described by the parameter @xmath21 ) and by the evolution of the planetary radius in response to mass loss ( described by the parameter @xmath130 ) .",
    "let us now turn our attention to more realistic situations where the external torque and the planet s radius internal evolution are not negligible",
    ". in this case equation [ dmdt22 ] leads to @xmath131\\;. \\label{dmdt2g}\\ ] ] since this is a linear differential equation , our conclusions about the stability of mass transfer do not change . if @xmath132 , the mass transfer is unstable as the mass loss rate runs away exponentially .",
    "however , if @xmath133 , there is a quasi steady state solution of the above equation with @xmath134 , where the mass loss rate is locked at a unique value given by @xmath135 this result , except for different notations , is the same as equation ( 16 ) of @xcite , a well known result in the binary mass transfer studies .",
    "we note that if the planet is cooling and there is no internal energy source , then @xmath136 , e.g. , the planet contracts with time ( equation [ tauc ] ) .",
    "the external torque is also negative by assumption , therefore for a _ contracting _ planet , @xmath137 as @xmath138 by definition , we see that the quasi - equilibrium mass loss solution is possible only if @xmath139 . in the opposite case",
    "the planet contracts too quickly to be tidally disrupted @xcite ; despite migrating in closer to the star , the mass transfer rate shuts down with time because @xmath33 decreases faster than @xmath61 .    on the contrary , if there are evolutionary reasons for the planet to swell with time , such as stellar irradiation or a powerful internal energy release by the solid core , then the thermal relaxation term in equation [ dotm_eq ] amplifies rather than dumps the mass loss rate",
    "in fact , mass loss from the planet may occur in this case even if there are no external torques on the planet .",
    "we can now justify our claim ( also well known from the stellar binary mass transfer studies ) in the end of  [ sec : loss ] that the equilibrium mass transfer rate does _ not _ depend on the exact form of the mass transfer rate function , @xmath140 . as long as that dependence is monotonic and a strong one , the difference @xmath141 adjusts to `` the right value '' which yields the equilibrium mass transfer rate given by equation [ dotm_eq ] .",
    "the mass transfer rate in this sense is not a `` driving '' variable of the problem ; it is one determined by the balance of the torques on the planet .",
    "curiously , in the case of the external torques strongly dominating over the thermal relaxation of the planet , @xmath142 , the mass transfer rate is further insensitive even to the planet s mass , @xmath22 .",
    "consulting equation [ tau_ext ] , we find that equation [ dotm_eq ] reads in this case , @xmath143 that is , in this case , the mass loss rate depends only on the external torque and location of the planet , @xmath24 , but not the mass of the planet .",
    "having understood the conditions under which the mass transfer rate can be steady , we now turn to the consequences of this for the radial migration of the planet . adding the external torque on the planet to equation [ dadt0 ]",
    ", we have @xmath144 when the mass loss rate is in the steady state regime ( equation [ dotm_eq ] ) , this becomes @xmath145 we remind ourselves that @xmath108 is defined to be negative ( equation [ tau_ext ] ) , that is , the the external torques are defined to drive the planet in rather than out .",
    "in contrast , @xmath114 could be positive or negative .",
    "the remarkable property of equation [ dadt2e ] is that , depending on the different terms in the equation , the planet may migrate either in or out _ despite being pushed inward by the external torque , e.g. , the outer disc_. furthermore , the relative magnitude of these terms may vary as the planet loses mass or evolves internally .",
    "we shall later see that due to this , the same planet may change the direction of migration several times .      when the thermal evolution of the planet is insignificant during the tidal disruption process , so that @xmath146 , we can neglect the cooling term in equation [ dadt2e ] : @xmath147 recall that in the steady - state mass transfer rate regime , the denominator of equation [ dadt2c0 ] is positive ( cf . ",
    "[ sec : simplest ] ) . since @xmath148",
    ", we see that when the polytropic approximation for the planet is adequate , @xmath149 that is , the planet migrates outward if @xmath150 , and inward otherwise . in particular , polytropic planets that expand as they lose",
    "mass ( @xmath151 ) always migrate outward .",
    "physically , @xmath130 controls the amount of mass that the planet has to shed in response to being forced inward by the external torque .",
    "this response is meager for planets that shrink due to mass loss . in order to maintain the @xmath152 equilibrium condition ,",
    "such planets may simply lose mass as @xmath61 shrinks .",
    "thus external torques are able to push these planets in . in the opposite case ,",
    "when @xmath153 , applying the external torque to push the planet in causes it to lose so much mass that the outward torque of this material exceeds the originally applied torque , and the planet thus moves outward rather than inward .",
    "when thermal relaxation of the planet is not negligible , e.g. , @xmath154 comparable to or much smaller than the external torque time scale , @xmath155 would suggest that a rapidly contracting planet , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , migrates as prescribed by the last term of that equation .",

    "the general outcome of the simulation is that the planet spirals in for about 200 years with zero mass loss , until it fills its roche radius and starts losing mass .",
    "the mass lost by the planet is transferred into the disc interior to it .",
    "a quasi - steady state is established in which the mass loss by the planet is exactly matched by the mass accreted onto the surface of the star .",

    "the blue dashed curve in the lower panel of fig . [ fig : cd_hist ] shows the predicted mass loss rate given by [ dotm_eq ] with @xmath21 given by equation [ fa_num ] .",
    "we observe that the analytical prediction provides an excellent description of the numerical results starting from the time when the planet fills its roche lobe , e.g. , from time @xmath257 yrs to @xmath258 yrs . during this time the mass loss rate from the planet",
    "is matched by the accretion rate of the star .",
    "the second marker of this quasi - equilibrium is the fact that the rate of planet s expansion / contraction due to mass loss and radiative cooling is exactly matched by the corresponding change in the hill s radius , so that the two are approximately equal ( cf .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ fig : cd_hist ] ) . note that the radius of the planet increases from @xmath259 to @xmath260 yrs , and then decreases until the sharp spike .",
    "this change in behaviour is explained by the fact that initially the planet s radius evolution is controlled by the mass loss , with cooling being negligible .",
    "thus the planet initially expands .",
    "after @xmath260 yrs , when the planet loses about half of its original mass , the radiative cooling becomes dominant in controlling the planet s radius evolution .",

    "however , after @xmath258 yrs the planet s mass loss rate stops decreasing with time , flattens off and then increases .",
    "the accretion rate onto the star follows the trend , but lagging behind the planet s mass loss .",
    "as we shall see below , this is not a time - delay effect but rather is a signature of a very important effect that does not occur in stellar binaries : the closing of the gap in the disc , due to which the inner disc material may flow past the planet . as the result of this",
    ", the planet suffers a nearly catastrophic disruption at @xmath261 yrs .",
    "figure [ fig : cd_disc ] shows several snapshots of the disc surface density versus radius covering the most interesting moments of this numerical experiment .",
    "the curves are marked by the respective time @xmath214 shown right next to them .",
    "as stated earlier , initially the surface density profile is everywhere zero . at @xmath257 yrs ( see the middle panel of figure [ fig : cd_hist ] ) , the planet eventually fills its roche lobe and starts transferring mass into the inner disc , filling it out .",
    "the first curve shown in figure [ fig : cd_disc ] corresponds to time @xmath262 yrs ( black solid curve ) , when the planet disruption just begins .",
    "the planet at that moment is at @xmath263 au .",
    "the material lost through the l1 point is circularised and is deposited at @xmath264 au ( note the break in the black curve in the figure ) , and then spreads viscously in both directions . at small radii the material eventually starts accreting onto the star , whereas at larger radii the torques from the planet prevent it from spreading outwards further . during this time the mass loss rate from the planet",
    "exceeds the accretion rate onto the star ( the rising part of the red dotted curve at @xmath257 yrs in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : cd_hist ] ) .",
    "the inner disc is thus being filled in by the material lost from the planet .",
    "the swelling of the inner disc can not go on forever , however . when the mass of the disc becomes significant enough ( @xmath265 and @xmath266 yrs curves in figure [ fig : cd_disc ] ) , the gravitational torque of the inner disc starts to affect the radial migration of the planet . the inner disc torque in fact exceeds that of the externally applied torque and the planet reverses its direction of migration .",
    "migrating outward , it is now able to settle into the self - regulated quasi - steady regime discussed earlier .",

    "this severely undercuts the ability of the planet to keep the gap open ( cf .",
    "equation [ gap ] ) .",

    "the last of the curves , @xmath271 yrs , shows that in the end the gap is completely erased and the disc spreads viscously outward even more . by that time",
    "the planet has lost most of its mass and the disc is hardly aware of its presence ( even though it consists entirely from the material formerly belonging to the planet in this simulation ) .",
    "the partial gap closing at @xmath272 yrs has catastrophic consequences for the planet .",
    "as the inner disc material diffuses outward through the gap , past the planet s orbit , less of the inner disc torque is passed on to the planet . in terms of the analytical parameterisation of  [ sec : analytical ] ,",
    "the fraction of the angular momentum passed back to the planet , @xmath21 , drops .",
    "since @xmath273 for @xmath274 planet , the mass transfer rate from the planet becomes unstable when @xmath21 drops below @xmath275 .",
    "the mass loss rate runs away exponentially at time @xmath261 yrs .",
    "physically , the planet s radius increases more rapidly due to the mass loss than the hill s radius could increase since the outward radial migration is compromised by the leaking gap . as can be seen from the bottom panel of figure [ fig : cd_hist ] , during this exponential runaway , the protostellar accretion rate does not manage to keep up with the rate at which the matter is deposited in it .",
    "this is not surprising as some of the matter flows outward through the gap .",
    "the runaway planet destruction via roche lobe overflow is bound to end in one of the two ways .",
    "one is a complete unbinding of the gaseous envelope that would leave only a rocky core ( which is present for this simulation by assumption ) . on the other hand ,",

    ", contraction time scale becomes very short at low planet s masses .",
    "this shuts off the mass loss at the end of simulation ext1 .",
    "a more realistic cooling model would probably lead to longer cooling times . on the other hand ,",

    "this atmosphere is not modelled here , and may remain bound to the core . clearly , better models of the internal structure of the planets must be used to address the issue of the post - disruption mass .",
    "as we have seen in simulation ext1 , when the gap closes , @xmath21 drops since the matter and angular momentum flow from the inner disc into the outer disc , past the planet .",
    "this reduces the rate of the outward migration of the planet and may destabilise the mass loss by the planet , leading to its runaway disruption . in view of the gap opening criterion ( equation [ gap ] ) , then , the outcome of the planetary tidal disruption depends on the disc viscosity , the planet mass , and the outer disc torque .",
    "the latter controls the accretion rate in the inner disc ( through the equilibrium mass loss condition in equation [ dotm_ext ] ) which in its turn regulates the geometrical disc aspect ratio , @xmath241 .    to explore this issue",

    "this is probably the reason for the mass transfer being unstable in this simulation .",
    "the first disruption episode is not final in this simulation . as the planet loses all but @xmath289 of its gaseous mass ( which corresponds to only 3% of its initial mass ) , the radiative cooling accelerates , and @xmath33 shrinks rapidly . at the same time",

    "the outward and inward disc torques on the planet must work in such a way as to push it steadily outward at a rate proportional to the outward disc torque ( cf .",

    ", the planet does not actually suffers a nearly catastrophic disruption when it reaches @xmath343 . at the start of the second planet mass loss spike ( time @xmath313 yrs in fig .",

    "this time roche lobe overflow is terminal for the gaseous part of the planet , and it is completely destroyed in the third roche lobe overflow event very quickly .",
    "the evolution of the disc after that is similar to sim1 .      to explore the importance of initial conditions , we set up simulation sim3 , which has same initial disc mass as sim2 , @xmath347 , but higher disc viscosity parameter , @xmath348 , and a different disc radial cutoff @xmath349 au ( see equation [ sigma0 ] ) . the outer boundary of the disc is enlarged to @xmath350 au .",

    "[ fig : hist_sim3_cycle ] , whereas the second set of curves ( red dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_sim3_cycle ] , respectively ) corresponds to the next trough in the accretion rate .",

    "[ fig : temp_sim3_cycle ] , we note that the two curves differ by a factor of @xmath5 two in the inner disc , and are almost identical behind the gap region . however , the gap region is significantly different at these two selected times .",
    "in particular , the disc central temperature @xmath358 k at the peak of the accretion rate cycle , and only @xmath359 k at the minimum of the cycle .",
    "these profound changes in the disc temperature have similarly profound consequences for planet evolution and the inner disc , as that is strongly linked to the planet s migration and mass loss rate .",
    "the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : temp_sim3_cycle ] shows that while the gap is only partially opened at the `` high - t '' state of the gap region , it gets fully opened at the `` low - t '' state , when viscosity of the material in the gap drops in response to the temperature variation .",
    "however , what causes the temperature drop in the gap region ? to address that , note that the planet mass loss rate actually dips much faster than the stellar accretion rate after any one of the peaks visible in the top panel of [ fig : hist_sim3_cycle ] .",
    "this implies that the planet has been pushed outward `` too far '' by the inner disc torques , and it continues to be pushed even further out for some @xmath360 yrs after the peak .",
    "the inner disc eventually runs out of material , as it is accreted onto the star .",
    "the outer disc then over - powers the torques from the inner one and the planet migrates inward again , restarting the mass loss and re - filling the inner disc for another cycle .",
    "thus , while the gap changes are pronounced , they appear to be driven by the behaviour of the inner disc , which makes the planet to switch between the full - gap to a partial - opened gap states .",
    "during the outburst state , the inner disc becomes very hot , with most of hydrogen atoms ionised .",
    "one may therefore expect that the @xmath7-parameter may be higher , in accord with estimates from dwarf nova systems @xcite , and magneto - rotational instability simulations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , modeling of the observations of fu ori outbursts by @xcite suggested that @xmath361 .",
    "we therefore present now simulation sim4 , which is identical to sim3 except @xmath362 .",
    "figure [ fig : hist_sim4 ] shows the outcome of this simulation , which contains both similarities and also very significant differences from all of the simulations presented earlier .",
    "similarly to the previously studied cases , the inner disc first empties onto the star , while the outer disc pushes the planet in .",
    "however , unlike any of the previous cases , the first accretion outburst episode onto the star is not driven by the planet filling its roche lobe and transferring its mass inward . instead , at time @xmath363 yrs , thermal disc instability is triggered . at that time , the planet is situated at @xmath342 au and does not fill its roche lobe .    to analyse",
    "the disc behaviour in greater detail , figure [ fig : temp_sigma_sim4 ] shows the disc structure just before the instability is triggered ( black solid curve ) , during the initial luminosity rise ( red dashed curve ) and just after the rise ( blue dotted ) .",
    "one notices that the instability is actually triggered at the outer banked - up edge of the gap , behind the planet , at @xmath364 au . before the instability",
    ", the disc is relatively cold everywhere , but especially so in the gap .",
    "as the instability flares up , the disc behind the gap heats up and the increased pressure of the gas is able to partially close the gap .",
    "the gas thus rushes inward , accumulating in the inner disc , sending that region of the disc on the hotter , upper stable branch of the `` s - curve '' @xcite , and leading to a massive rapid - rise outburst .",
    "the outburst in the simulation sim4 is in a qualitative agreement with @xcite , except here it is supplemented by the mass loss from the planet .",
    "note that in this high @xmath7 ( and thus high accretion rate ) simulation , the mass loss from the planet is a relatively minor detail .",
    "indeed , when the mass loss from the planet sets in ( @xmath365 yrs ) , it exceeds the prior value of the accretion rate onto the star only in the first @xmath366 yrs or so .",
    "together with sim3 , this simulation clearly demonstrates that non - linear coupling between the hydrogen ionisation instability in the disc and the planet - disc mass exchange may be important in determining a variability pattern in the accretion rate onto the star .",
    "figure [ fig : temp_sim4 ] shows the disc central temperature ( top panel ) and the disc effective temperature ( bottom panel ) for several representative times for the simulation sim4 . along with those curves , we also show the best fit power - laws of the inner hot disc model of @xcite to their nir keck interferometer data for the three well known fu ori objects .",
    "these observations have spatial resolution as good as @xmath367 au , and thus serve as direct and sensitive probes of the spectral disc model fits .",
    "the effective temperature profiles of our discs in the inner region are not that dissimilar from the best fit models of @xcite , except for the presence of the gap .",
    "this qualitative agreement is encouraging , given that we did not try to fine tune our models to satisfy the spectral constraints .",
    "this suggests that our models may be relevant to the observed fu ori sources , although it is desirable to attempt more detailed spectral fits to the observations in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "this is however beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "in this paper we presented calculations of the tidal disruption of massive gaseous planets in massive accretion discs of young protostars . in the analytical part of the paper (  [ sec : analytical ] ) , we derived conditions under which the mass and angular momentum exchange between the planet and the disc is in a quasi steady state ( cf .",
    "text around equation [ unstable ] ) , and the corresponding equilibrium mass loss rate from the planet .",
    "qualitatively , these conditions require ( a ) the planet to be massive enough to keep the gap in the disc opened ; and ( b ) the mass - radius relation for the planet to be such that the planet contracts as it loses mass or at least expands only as a weak power - law of the planet s mass , @xmath22 .",
    "we then formulated a numerical 1d approach to modeling the planet - disc mass and angular momentum exchange (  [ sec : numerics ] ) .",
    "utilising a toy cooling model for a young planet , and a fixed external torque driving the planet in , we found that our numerical model reproduces the analytically expected results well (  [ sec : cd ] ) , including the quasi - steady state planet s disruption ( roche lobe overflow ) , and the eventual closing of the gap and a runaway planet disruption when the planet s mass becomes too low .",
    "we then proceeded to several tests ( labelled sim1 to sim4 in table 1 ) in which the planet - disc torques are calculated self - consistently .",
    "the most robust result of our calculations is that if there is a massive young planet in the inner disc , then the accretion rate onto the protostar must be strongly variable on time scales ranging from a few years to a few hundred or even thousands of years .",
    "there are simply too many non linear physical processes occurring in the planet - disc system for the accretion rate to remain static over long time scales .",
    "first of all , as well known from previous literature @xcite a massive planet opens a deep gap in the disc , blocking the flow of matter from the exterior disc to the inner one .",
    "such a blockade of the protostar by the young planet may be the reason why the average accretion rates of protostars appear to be lower than expected theoretically @xcite .",
    "we found two ways in which the blockade is ended , and both lead to a rapid rise accretion outburst that may be relevant for the observations of fu ori outbursts .",
    "the first of these , encountered in the relatively high @xmath7 simulation sim4 ( @xmath362 , cf .",
    " [ sec : lc04 ] and figure [ fig : hist_sim4 ] ) , is the same as the @xcite model for fu ori outbursts . in this case",
    "thermal ( hydrogen ionisation ) instability sets in at the outer edge of the gap in the material piled up behind the planet .",
    "heating up , the outer disc is able to close the gap , overflow the planet and fuel an outside - out accretion outburst .",
    "the second way to kick - start accretion onto the star was found in all of our lower @xmath7 simulations ( sim1 to sim3 in table 1 ) . in these cases the planet",
    "is pushed inward sufficiently fast to fill its roche lobe before the hydrogen ionisation instability at the outer gap takes place .",
    "the planet then loses mass through its l1 point .",
    "the material circularises inward of the planet , and spreads viscously . as gas accretes onto the protostar , the accretion rate rises by orders of magnitude .",
    "what happens next depends on the internal properties of the planet .",
    "if conditions for the quasi - steady state mass transfer are satisfied , then the planet migrates radially ( usually in the outward direction ) , so that the hills radius is exactly equal to the planet s radius .",
    "the resulting outburst light curve may then resemble a step function , similarly to the fu ori outburst itself @xcite .    during this quasi - steady state planet - star mass transfer ,",
    "the role of the planet completely reverses .",
    "while before the outburst the planet prevented the material from the outer disc from reaching the star , now it is the donor for the star .",
    "also , like in a stellar binary system , the planet takes the excess angular momentum of the inner disc away and does not allow the material to spread outward viscously .",
    "this latter effect keeps the accretion rate onto the star at a higher value for longer than it would have been if the gas could flow past the planet .",
    "if the steady - state conditions for mass transfer are violated , then an even more dramatic outburst may occur .",
    "the planet is then tidally disrupted on time scale of a few to few tens of years .",
    "the material disrupted off the planet then spreads viscously in both directions , and the accretion rate onto the star drops rapidly as there is no planet to bank up the inner disc in the outward direction .",
    "on the top of this generic behaviour , we found variability on smaller time scales caused by a non - linear connection between the planet migration and mass loss and hydrogen ionisation instability .",
    "for example , in simulation sim3 (  [ sec : sim3 ] ) , only the gap region of the disc is unstable and switches between the ionised and the non - ionised states , modulating the accretion rate onto the protostar .",
    "these results do depend quite sensitively on the internal structure of the planet , as we described in ",
    "[ sec : embryo_contraction ] .",
    "in particular , if planets are smaller after h@xmath220 dissociation than we assumed in most of our simulations here , then they may not be disrupted at all . in this case the planets are driven all the way into the star or the magnetospheric cavity .",
    "this corresponds to the `` high density start '' models @xcite parametrised by @xmath368 .",
    "therefore , better modeling of the internal relaxation of the growing planets , including possible massive solid cores and the luminosity released by these , is absolutely necessary to detail predictions of our model further .",
    "it is possible that every young protostar goes through as many as 10 - 20 fu ori events during its growth @xcite .",
    "recent modeling of the embedded phase of low mass proto stars by @xcite also suggests that large amplitude variability in the accretion rate is widespread , and that stars may actually acquire most of its mass in bursts .",
    "if our model for fu ori outbursts is to apply to the observations , many giant planets are required per star .",
    "is this reasonable ?",
    "the answer strongly depends on which planet formation theory is accepted . in the standard core accretion ( ca )",
    "model @xcite of planet formation , giant planets are formed `` late '' , e.g. , after a few myrs .",
    "these planets are also expected to be rather compact @xcite .",
    "tidal disruption of giant ca planets is therefore unlikely , and having as many as ten of such per star would also seem implausible .    the gravitational disc instability model for planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was thought to form planets only at distances greater than 50 - 100 au ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) due to inefficient cooling at closer distances @xcite .",
    "it may therefore appear that planets born at these large distances would be of no relevance to this paper .",
    "however , working in the context of proto stellar accretion rather than planet formation , @xcite showed that their clumps migrated inward rapidly , reaching all the way to their inner computational domain boundary of 10 au .",
    "these results have been supported by their more recent simulations @xcite and by simulations of a number of independent authors @xcite .",
    "@xcite provide an in depth analysis of the rapid migration of gas clumps in self - gravitating discs and conclude that these clumps migrate via type i regime .",
    "these authors find that massive planets migrate inward faster than a disc gap could be opened .",
    "a recently submitted manuscript by zhu et al ( 2011b ; private communication ) also shows many examples of massive clumps migrating inward rapidly although the authors find that some of these clumps become substantially more massive than a giant planet .",
    "note that these results only apply to the outer gravito - turbulent discs ; in the inner non self - gravitating disc regions studied here , planet migration must slow down considerably just because planets we consider are 1 - 3 orders of magnitude more massive than the total mass of these inner discs .",
    "standard gap opening criteria should apply then .",
    "@xcite argued that tidal disruption of gaseous envelopes of the giant proto - planets may be a plausible way to form all kinds of planets in what was called the `` tidal downsizing hypothesis '' for planet formation .",

    "in this paper we studied the planet and the disc evolution in cases when the young massive gas giant planet overfills its roche lobe and transfer its mass back into the disc .",
    "due to significant uncertainties in the internal structure of young planets , large parameter space for the problem , and still missing physics , our study can not yet give definitive answers on what exactly happens with the planets .",
    "instead , this work is to be viewed as one establishing an analytical and numerical framework for further studies of the planet - disc - star mass exchange .",
    "it appears that roche lobe overflow of young giant gas planets holds a potential promise as an explanation for the enigmatic fu ori outbursts of protostars .",
    "we note in passing that a subset of our models ( such as sim3 ) may be relevant to shorter period and lower accretion rate variable protostars such as exors @xcite .",
    "if fu ori outbursts and episodic accretion onto protostars are indeed connected to tidal disruptions of young planets then the implication would be that many young giant planets are tidally destroyed or perhaps swallowed whole by their parent proto - stars .",
    "future work should include better treatment of the planet s internal structure , especially a possible presence of truly massive solid cores , add type i migration ( neglected here ) , the possibility for the overflow through the l2 point ( neglected here ) , and aim to model the `` end '' result when the gas disc is presumably dispersed by disc photo - evaporation .",

    "<S> it has been recently proposed that giant protoplanets migrating inward through the disc more rapidly than they contract could be tidally disrupted when they fill their roche lobes @xmath0 au away from their parent protostars . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider the process of mass and angular momentum exchange between the tidally disrupted planet and the surrounding disc in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the planet s adiabatic mass - radius relation and its ability to open a deep gap in the disc determine whether the disruption proceeds as a sudden runaway or a balanced quasi - static process . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> the planet feeds the inner disc through its lagrangian l1 point like a secondary star in a stellar binary system . </S>",
    "<S> as the planet loses mass it gains specific angular momentum and normally migrates in the outward direction until the gap closes . </S>",
    "<S> numerical experiments show that planet disruption outbursts are preceded by long `` quiescent '' periods during which the disc inward of the planet is empty . </S>",
    "<S> the hole in the disc is created when the planet opens a deep gap , letting the inner disc to drain onto the star while keeping the outer one stalled behind the planet . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mass - losing planet embedded in a realistic protoplanetary disc spawns an extremely rich set of variability patterns . in a subset of parameter space </S>",
    "<S> , there is a limit cycle behaviour caused by non - linear interaction between the planet mass loss and the disc hydrogen ionisation instability . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that tidal disruptions of young massive planets near their stars may be responsible for the observed variability of young accreting protostars such as fu ori , exor and t tauri stars in general .    </S>",
