    "the two giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) found within a few arcminutes of sgr a@xmath1 are known to be physically located at the galactic center and are seen interacting with the nuclear region .",
    "as discussed in coil & ho ( 1999 , paper 1 ) , the 20 cloud ( `` m-0.13 - 0.08 '' ) , lying 10 pc directly south of sgr a * in projection ( using r@xmath2=8.5 pc ) , appears to be feeding the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) via a molecular gas streamer called the `` southern streamer '' in paper 1 .",
    "the velocity gradient seen along the southern streamer places the 20 cloud slightly in front of the cnd along our line of sight .",
    "the 20 cloud is connected to the other nearby gmc , the 50 cloud ( `` m-0.02 - 0.07 '' ) , by a ridge of gas and dust ( ho et al .",
    "1991 ; dent et al . 1993 ) .",
    "this ridge appears to be compressed gas which wraps around sgr a east and continues to the core of the 50 cloud , located @xmath3 2 ( 5 pc ) east of sgr a*. sgr a east is an expanding shell of synchrotron emission which lies _ behind _ sgr a * and the cnd ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is roughly 10 pc across and appears to be the result of an explosion which had an estimated total energy of @xmath35 10@xmath4 ergs ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , over an order of magnitude greater than the energy released by a typical snr .",
    "it is unclear at present whether sgr a east resulted from a highly energetic snr , a typical snr which expanded into a pre - existing bubble , or from a nuclear event peculiar to its location in the galactic center .",
    "it has been suggested that the tidal disruption of a star by the massive black hole sgr a * could account for the energy and morphology of sgr a east ( khokhlov & melia 1996 ) .",
    "sgr a east is expanding into the 50 km sec@xmath5 cloud ( @xcite ; @xcite ; serabyn , lacy & achtermann 1992 ) , sweeping up gas in the western edge of the cloud , pushing it away from the nuclear region and creating a sharp , narrow ridge of dense gas .",
    "kinematics of the ridge indicate that the gas in the 50 cloud is being pushed both to the east and behind sgr a east along the line of sight , which would place the 50 cloud adjacent to and partially behind sgr a east .",
    "the velocity shift resulting from this expansion is reported as 20 by ho et al .",
    "( 1991 ) , as seen in north - south position - velocity diagrams taken along the western edge of the molecular ridge with a spectral resolution of 9.8 .",
    "genzel et al .",
    "( 1990 ) detect a shift of roughly 40 ( resolution @xmath32.5 ) in an east - west position - velocity diagram taken + 40  in declination relative to sgr a * , and serabyn et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ( resolution 0.6 ) also measure a shift of 40 based on spectra located just west of the ridge .",
    "the line width in the core of the 50 cloud is fwhm=40 , which is unusually broad for molecular cloud cores .",
    "the ridge of shocked gas is long and narrow , roughly 3 pc across and extending well over 10 pc north to south . along the length of the entire ridge connecting the 20 cloud with the 50 cloud and along the compression wave front",
    "there is a roughly north - south velocity gradient of 5 - 6 arcmin@xmath5 .",
    "four hii regions are seen along the eastern edge of sgr a east , in the vicinity of the dense ridge of gas at the edge of the 50 cloud .",
    "the hii regions all have velocities of 43 - 51 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and many have shell - like morphologies .",
    "the hii regions seem to be located in the 50 cloud , close to the near edge along the line of sight .",
    "an h@xmath60 maser lies near the hii regions , possibly resulting from the expansion of sgr a east into the surrounding molecular gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "several 1720 mhz oh masers are detected around the sgr a east shell , both along the southern rim and on the northwestern side near the cnd ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the 1720 mhz oh maser line has been found to be a good diagnostic of shock excitation , being found consistently at shock boundaries of supernova remnants ( snrs ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "yusef - zadeh et al . ( 1996 ) propose that the group of masers on the southern rim traced the expansion of sgr a east into the 50 cloud .",
    "figure [ cartoon1 ] schematically outlines the relevant large - scale features in the central 15 pc of the galaxy .",
    "paper 1 discussed the southern streamer and its interactions with the cnd . in this paper",
    "we report on nh@xmath0(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) observations of the 50 cloud and molecular ridge and discuss a snr to the south of sgr a east .",
    "section 2 details the observations and data reduction , while section 3 presents our results , which are discussed in section 4 .",
    "we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "we observed the metastable ( j , k)=(1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) transitions of nh@xmath0 at the frequencies 23.694495 and 23.722633 ghz using the vla , operated by nrao , in dnc configuration .",
    "a total of five overlapping 2 fields were mapped towards sgr a * on the night of 1995 february 10 .",
    "the mosaiced field of view is @xmath3 4 by 5 , covering the inner 10 - 12 pc of the galaxy .",
    "results from the western three fields are presented in an earlier paper ( paper 1 ) , and here we will show velocity - integrated images from all five fields but will focus mainly on the eastern two fields , which cover the western edge of the 50 cloud and the molecular ridge .",
    "our total bandwidth is 12 mhz centered at @xmath7= 31.14 km @xmath8 for the eastern two fields .",
    "the spectral resolution is 4.9 , corresponding to a total velocity coverage of 140 for our final 28 channels .",
    "we tapered our images to a synthesized beam size of @xmath3 @xmath9 with a position angle of 12.6@xmath10 .",
    "details of the flux , phase and bandpass calibrations are described in paper 1 .",
    "data from all five fields were jointly imaged and deconvolved in miriad , effectively mosaicing the data in the u , v plane .",
    "we employed the same cleaning technique as in paper 1 , where we added a flat offset of zero - spacing flux during the clean process which was removed after cleaning .",
    "the images presented in this paper have all been corrected for the primary beam response unlike many of the images shown in paper 1 which were tapered at the edges , resulting in a lower correction ( and lower noise ) at the edges of those images .",
    "all coordinates are b1950 epoch .",
    "figure [ color.mom0 ] is an nh@xmath0 velocity - integrated mosaic map of all five fields seen in contours overlaid on a color 20 cm continuum image of sgr a east and west ( lang , morris , & echevarria 1999 ) .",
    "sgr a west is the over - saturated black region , inside of which the mini - spiral of ionized gas streamers converge near the location of sgr a*. the red emission traces sgr a east , which is offset from sgr a west . the contours display 1 emission on the left and 2 on the right .",
    "there are two prominent north - south streamers in these images .",
    "the `` southern streamer '' ( see paper 1 ) connects the circumnuclear disk ( cnd ) surrounding the ionized gas mini - spiral with the 20 to the south .",
    "the northern half of the 20 cloud is shown in these images , located at r.a.=17@xmath1142@xmath1228@xmath13.5 , dec.=-29@xmath1402@xmath15.0 .",
    "as reported in paper 1 , we find a velocity gradient of @xmath35 - 8 arcmin@xmath5 along the southern streamer with the gas redshifting to the north , which places the 20 cloud in _",
    "front _ of the nuclear region along the line of sight .",
    "details of this streamer are discussed further in paper 1 .",
    "the other long streamer in figure [ color.mom0 ] is the molecular ridge which traces the denser parts of the 50 cloud , including the core of the cloud and gas in the southern part of the gmc where sgr a east is expanding into the cloud .",
    "there is strong emission in the northern half of the streamer where the ridge wraps around the eastern edge of sgr a east .",
    "the 50 cloud continues to the east and north beyond the edge of the figure ( zylka , mezger , & wink 1990 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the narrow , concentrated ridge of molecular gas wraps around sgr a east and continues to the south at a lower flux level , past -29@xmath1403@xmath15 to the edge of our sampled field .",
    "the width of the molecular ridge is roughly constant along its length , though to the south of sgr a east the emission is fluffier and more spread out .",
    "the gas is highly clumped , and the sharp edges where the intensity of the emission increases quickly are not smooth along the length of the ridge .",
    "the emission in the northern part of the ridge falls off more steeply at the edges than in the southern part , which may indicate that the gas to the north is more confined than to the south .",
    "the northern part of the ridge closely follows the arc of sgr a east , appearing to wrap around the expanding shell .",
    "there are many small bumps and protrusions of the gas which are seen in both the 1 and 2 data , including the location of the peak emission in the northern part of the ridge .",
    "the flux in the ridge is higher in the north , and the peak is found lying along the easternmost part of sgr a east .",
    "there is an extension of the gas projected onto sgr a east near dec.=-28@xmath1459@xmath150.5@xmath16 , where there is a large hollow bubble in the continuum emission greater than 1@xmath15 in size , clearing gas into the molecular ridge to the east and sgr a west and the cnd to the west .",
    "this hollow bubble can be seen clearly in figure [ color.mom0 ] where there is a yellow hollow region inside the red emission from sgr a east , near the southeastern edge of sgr a east in between the two streamers .",
    "the molecular emission closely traces the eastern and western edges of the bubble , wrapping just around the outside of the hollow area .",
    "morphologically it appears that the bubble is interacting with both the molecular ridge and the gas in the northern part of the streamer connecting the 20 cloud to the cnd ( the `` southern streamer '' in paper 1 ) . to the south of this bubble , there is another region where the gas from the ridge has a protrusion to the west , near the southern edge of sgr a east . at this location",
    "a connection has been imaged between the molecular ridge and the 20 cloud in nh@xmath0(3,3 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "we do not image a connection here , but connections between these features have also been imaged in @xmath17co(2 - 1 ) ( @xcite ) and submillimeter thermal dust emission ( @xcite and @xcite ) .    along the eastern edge of sgr a east",
    ", the molecular ridge continues without break or bend to the south past where the continuum emission stops .",
    "the separation between the two streamers in the southern half of these images is roughly constant , which may in part be affected by the deep negative sidelobes due to the lack of short spacings and the fact that the mapped region is sampled only at full - beam spacings .",
    "however , the narrowness of the ridge in the southeast is not likely due to the primary beam response as our primary beam includes much of the empty region in the southeast as seen in figure [ beam.mom0 ] .",
    "this image shows our effective mosaiced primary beam pattern on the sky and labels the percentage level of flux sampling over the region .",
    "we have not plotted emission with a gain below 15% as those features are unreliable . while the beam response is not uniform across the field ,",
    "it is at least 50% everywhere , so that at most our flux may be down by a factor of two in the very central region .",
    "the northernmost part of the molecular ridge shows high flux near the edge of the primary beam , indicating that the ridge continues to the north beyond our sampled field .",
    "our limited velocity range may also cause undersampling in this region .",
    "an area which is interesting for its lack of flux is the lower left of the map , to the east of the southern part of the molecular ridge , where with a 100% beam response level we do not detect emission .",
    "many of the most striking features seen in figure [ color.mom0 ] are apparent in both 1 and 2 emission .",
    "similarities between the images include the narrow width of the molecular ridge , the location of the peak emission in the ridge , and the extension of gas into sgr a east at the eastern side of the bubble . the localized emission in between the two streamers at the southern edge of sgr a east ( dec.=-29@xmath1400@xmath1530@xmath16 ) is seen in both maps , and the structure of the 20 cloud is very similar in the 1 and 2 images , where the many peaks and fingers of emission are the same .",
    "the main differences between the 1 and 2 velocity - integrated emission maps are seen concentrated near the nuclear region ( discussed at length in paper 1 ) .",
    "figure [ bw.snr.mom0 ] shows the same continuum image as figure [ color.mom0 ] with our velocity - integrated nh@xmath0 contours , but here the stretch of the grey - scale has been altered to bring out lower level features in the 20 cm continuum image .",
    "four small hii regions are located just off the eastern edge of sgr a east , seen here as small black spots at the top left of the continuum image ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the molecular ridge of gas is narrowly confined to the region in between the eastern edge of sgr a east and the hii regions 0.5@xmath15 away . in the 2 image",
    "the northernmost part of the streamer above dec.=-28@xmath1830@xmath16 is narrower and is seen just at the edge of sgr a east and does not extend eastward to the northern two hii regions .",
    "the southernmost hii region , located at r.a.=17@xmath1142@xmath1241@xmath13 , dec.=-28@xmath1912@xmath16 and labeled d in discussions of this hii region grouping ( @xcite ) , appears to be still embedded in dense molecular gas where the contours peak sharply into a small clump on the eastern edge of the ridge .",
    "this hii region is the only one of the four which does not have a shell - like morphology , which could indicate that it is in an earlier stage of development .",
    "it may either be younger than the other hii regions or its expansion or flow out of the cloud may have been slowed by the dense gas surrounding it .    in figure [ bw.snr.mom0 ]",
    "there is an intriguing association between the continuum and molecular line emission along the 20 cloud in the southwestern part of the image .",
    "the 20 cloud follows the arc of the two dark streaks of continuum emission known as sgr a - f and sgr a - e ( the ` wisp ' ) ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "( 1985 ) suggest that these two non - thermal arcs trace the edge of a snr which may be expanding into the 20 cloud , compressing the gas in the gmc .",
    "figure [ bw.snr.mom0 ] reveals a hollow shell extending across the southern half of the image , including these arcs to the southwest and continuing up around the southern edge of sgr a east and extending out along another curved arc centered at r.a.=17@xmath1142@xmath1240@xmath13 , dec.=-29@xmath1400@xmath1530@xmath16 . the southern edge of sgr a east has a curved shape seen in figures [ color.mom0 ] and [ bw.snr.mom0 ] which follows the arc of the snr , opposing the curvature of the roughly spherical sgr a east shell itself .    in the 3 velocity - integrated map ( @xcite , see figure 1 ) the molecular ridge does not continue as far to the south as it does in the 1 and 2 maps .",
    "the 3 image shows the ridge following the eastern arc of sgr a east down to dec.=-29@xmath1000@xmath1530@xmath16 where the ridge then splits off from sgr a east and continues to the southwest towards the 20 cloud .",
    "the ridge does not continue south of dec.=-29@xmath1002@xmath15 .",
    "in the 1 and 2 images , the ridge has the same behavior as the 3 emission down to dec.=-29@xmath1002@xmath15 , where instead of connecting with the 20 cloud as in the 3 image , it continues further south to dec.=-29@xmath1003@xmath15 . because the length of the southern part of the ridge is different from the 3 image",
    ", we investigate this emission further to look for possible contamination by sidelobes from the 20 cloud .",
    "figure [ sgra12.mom0 ] displays velocity - integrated maps of the southern two fields of the 1 data imaged individually without any mosaicing of other fields .",
    "the image on the left is from the southeastern field only and does not show any emission from the 20 cloud",
    ". the southern part of the ridge can not be due to sidelobe structure from the 20 cloud as the ridge is seen clearly in the primary beam centered on this region .",
    "the southwestern field is shown on the right , where the 20 cloud and part of the southern streamer is seen .",
    "the negative contours are due to sidelobe structure , as are the positive contours in the eastern half of the image .",
    "this figure shows that the southern half of the ridge is not strongly affected by sidelobe structure from the 20 cloud .",
    "we also show position - velocity cuts taken along the southern part of the ridge and the 20 cloud in figure [ sidelobe ] to see if the kinematics of the gas in the ridge and the gmc are identical , as would result from strong sidelobe contamination .",
    "the position - velocity diagrams from cut a do not match those from cut b in either 1 or 2 emission .",
    "the locations of the velocity peaks , as well as the line widths , do not correlate between the two cuts .",
    "we conclude that the structure of the southern part of the ridge is real and that contamination by sidelobes from the 20 cloud is not important .",
    "figure [ dust.mom0 ] overlays contours of 1.3 mm emission ( @xcite ) in the sgr a complex with a grey - scale image of our 1 velocity - integrated emission .",
    "the 1.3 mm map traces both free - free emission from ionized gas in the sgr a west hii region and thermal dust emission from the gmcs which traces the total column of gas .",
    "the 1.3 mm data has an angular resolution of 11@xmath16 and is quite comparable to the resolution of the nh@xmath0 data .",
    "as single dish data however , the 1.3 mm image is more sensitive to emission on larger scales than our interferometric data , which are missing the shortest spacing information , so that the 1.3 mm map better traces the large - scale structure of the material in the region .",
    "the peak of the 1.3 mm emission delineates the ionized gas in the sgr a west hii region where the southern half of the inner edge of the cnd can be seen in grey - scale at the lower edge of the spiral .",
    "the streamer to the south which connects the nuclear region with the 20 cloud is present in both the dust and molecular gas images , where the 1.3 mm contours closely trace the 1 emission .",
    "the core of the 20 cloud is seen at the lower edge of the 1.3 mm image , beyond the spatial coverage of our 1 map .",
    "the dark grey - scale emission traces only the northern part of the 20 cloud , where the gmc is becoming narrower and elongated , connecting with the nuclear region .",
    "there is extremely excellent agreement in detailed spatial structures between the 1 , 2 , and dust maps .",
    "the other dark region of the grey - scale 1 map marks the core of the 50 cloud in the upper left of the image , near ra=17@xmath1142@xmath1240@xmath13 and dec.=-28@xmath1059@xmath15 .",
    "the entire 50 gmc includes fluffier emission not traced by the nh@xmath0 emission in the molecular ridge , and extends to the north beyond the extent of our images .",
    "near the 50 cloud core and towards the south where the 50 cloud bends towards the sgr a west spiral , the 1 emission in the molecular ridge closely corresponds to the areas of highest dust column density as seen in the 1.3 mm image .",
    "however , at the cloud core the 1 emission does not continue to the eastern edge of our field where the dust column density is still high .",
    "it has been suggested that the 50 cloud may also feed the cnd via a streamer of gas and dust in a similar manner as the 20 cloud .",
    "an intriguing gas streamer has been seen in single - dish hcn emission by ho ( 1994 ) , where a distinct narrow streamer appears to connect the western edge of the 50 cloud with the nuclear region .",
    "this streamer is seen well in the individual channel maps , specifically around 60 . a similar streamer connecting",
    "the 50 cloud with the cnd has been imaged in @xmath17co(2 - 1 ) emission by zylka et al .",
    "the streamer can be seen in the channel map showing emission from 50 to 60 ( their figure 5.d ) .",
    "this streamer has not been seen in other millimeter and sub - millimeter observations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) nor in interferometric nh@xmath0(3,3 ) data ( @xcite ) , nor do we detect it here .",
    "it remains unclear whether the 50 cloud directly feeds the nuclear region or whether the streamer is being projected along the line of sight , though it is clear from the dust maps that if an eastern streamer exists it must have a lower column density than the southern streamer .",
    "there is also an intriguing finger of dust emission to the north of the 50 cloud which points in towards the nucleus , at the top of the cnd near ra=17@xmath1142@xmath1233@xmath13 and dec.=-29@xmath1058@xmath15 .",
    "the 1 molecular ridge continues to the south of the 50 cloud core where the dust emission is lower ( dec.=-29@xmath1000@xmath15 to -29@xmath1003@xmath15 ) .",
    "the ratio of flux in the 50 cloud and the 20 cloud to the southern part of the ridge is higher in 1 than in 1.3 mm dust emission .",
    "this implies that the relative prominence of the 1 emission in the southern part of the ridge as compared to the 1.3 mm emission is due in part to the contouring of the 1.3 mm image and is most likely due to the sensitivity of the 1.3 mm map to extended lower density material .",
    "the long molecular ridge as seen in the 1 image has a constant , narrow width which is reflected in the dust emission only along the northern half of the streamer . at the southern tip of the molecular ridge there is a u - shaped feature in the 1.3 mm image connecting the ridge with the eastern side of the 20 cloud .",
    "a connection between the two gmcs has been imaged in nh@xmath0(3,3 ) ( ho et al .",
    "1991 ) , with similar coverage as our 1 and 2 maps , and in submillimeter continuum ( dent et al .",
    "1993 ) , which has similar coverage as the 1.3 mm emission shown here .",
    "it appears from figure [ dust.mom0 ] that the two gmcs are not entirely separate entities connected only by a thin ridge of gas , but the clouds and ridge may be intimately connected and part of a coherent larger structure of gas lying along the galactic plane .",
    "striking features of our velocity - integrated 1 and 2 images include the narrowness of the two streamers seen lying along the galactic plane and the roughly constant separation between them .",
    "our lack of zero - spacing information prevents us from concluding whether the narrowness of the streamers is meaningful .",
    "the roughly constant spacing between the two streamers in our maps is not seen in other images of the region and may be due to the negative trenches resulting from sidelobe structure in between the two streamers ( see figure [ color.mom0 ] ) . comparing our maps to the 3 and 1.3 mm emission",
    "it seems that we are missing structure in between the two streamers at the southern edge of sgr a east .",
    "the total column density as seen by the dust emission shows the molecular ridge curving around sgr a east in the south , pointing towards the southern streamer as it approaches the nuclear region . the 3 map",
    "more closely follows the dust emission in this region than our 1 and 2 images , and in the 3 image there are two connections seen between the streamers : one along the southern edge of sgr a east , which is also seen in the dust emission , and another connection further south at dec.=-29@xmath1002@xmath15 .",
    "our images do not show either of these connections , which may be a result of the negative sidelobe trench or may also be a temperature effect .",
    "the 1.3 mm dust emission does show low - level flux along the southern part of the molecular ridge but it is not confined to a narrow streamer , whereas the northern half of the ridge is narrow in both our maps and the 1.3 mm map .",
    "figure [ 22.11.mom0 ] indicates regions of heating as derived from the 2/1 line ratio where the dark regions trace heated gas .",
    "the rotation temperature of the gas can be derived from the ratio of 2 to 1 observed brightness temperatures if the lines are optically thin . in the optically thin limit a 2/1 ratio of 0.5 implies a rotation temperature of 21 k , a ratio of 1 corresponds to 33 k , a ratio of 1.5 corresponds to 49 k , and a ratio of 2 corresponds to a rotation temperature of 73 k. these values are in actuality a lower limit on the rotation temperature , because if line opacities are substantial a correction must be made based on the optical depth of the 1 line ( see figure 4 of @xcite for details of how the rotation temperature depends on the optical depth ) .",
    "nevertheless , a simple map of the 2/1 line ratio can still provide heating information if the optical depth of the gas does not change significantly over the region .",
    "the contours in figure [ 22.11.mom0 ] are from the 6 cm continuum map of sgr a east as seen in figure [ color.mom0 ] , overlaid on a grey - scale map of the velocity - integrated 2/1 ratio , with the dark regions of high 2/1 ratio showing hotter gas .",
    "heating in the nuclear region , near the cnd , was discussed in paper 1 . here",
    "we focus on the molecular ridge and the 20 cloud , where most of the heating is along the western edges of these features .",
    "there is not much heating seen along the northern part of the inner edge of the molecular ridge where the gas appears to be directly interacting with sgr a east .",
    "we are unable to estimate optical depths at this location from our spectra and can not determine whether this apparent lack of heating is real .",
    "the extension of gas projected onto sgr a east shows signs of heating , as does the small region of emission seen in between the two streamers at the southern edge of sgr a east .",
    "the southern part of the molecular ridge shows heating on both the eastern and western sides , much like the 20 cloud emission .",
    "much of the heating in this map is along the edges of the streamers .",
    "this is not an imaging artifact , where the edges are darker due to cutoffs in the processing of the maps , as 2/1 ratio maps made with many different cutoffs show all of the same regions of heating .",
    "the apparent edge heating may well be affected by optical depth differences along the edges of the streamers .",
    "figures [ mom1 ] and [ mom2 ] display kinematic features of the gas in the molecular ridge as well as the southern streamer .",
    "figure [ mom1 ] maps the mean velocity of the gas at each pixel , where the dark regions correspond to higher velocity gas .",
    "the grey - scale ranges from 15 for the white areas to 60 in the black regions .",
    "there is an overall velocity gradient along the length of the molecular ridge , where the gas in the northern half of the ridge has been redshifted by @xmath320 .",
    "the mean velocity does not appear to increase linearly along the length of the streamer , but instead the northern half of the streamer appears to be at @xmath340 where the ridge wraps around the edge of sgr a east , while the southern part of the streamer also appears to be at @xmath320 .",
    "this change in velocity near the southern edge of sgr a east , where the ridge does not appear to be directly interacting with sgr a east , can be seen in both the 1 and 2 maps .",
    "there are also noticeable smaller dark regions of pronounced redshifting of the gas .",
    "this occurs at the inner edge of the molecular ridge where the gas appears to extend into sgr a east in projection .",
    "this gas is also heated , as seen in figure [ 22.11.mom0 ] , and may be located at the far side of sgr a east , being redshifted along the line of sight by the expansion of sgr a east .",
    "the redshifting of the extension is seen to a lesser degree in the 2 image , where the gas is highly redshifted at the base of the extension but the mean velocity decreases further along the extension .",
    "there is another intriguing localized region of redshifting seen in the 1 image at the outer edge of the molecular cloud , near dec.=-29@xmath1000@xmath1545@xmath16 .",
    "the eastern edge of the 20 cloud is also redshifted relative to the rest of the cloud , and at the lower tip of the cloud there is a small area of redshifted gas where there are a few contours from the 6 cm continuum map .",
    "this non - thermal feature , dubbed the `` wisp '' ( @xcite ) , has been proposed to be the result of a supernova remnant interacting with the ambient molecular gas .",

    "along the western molecular ridge , there is little change in dispersion in the 1 image across the northern half of the ridge from east to west where the ridge wraps around the eastern side of sgr a east , possibly indicating that all of this gas has been processed and is in a post - shock phase , which is consistent with the lack of heating here ( see figure [ 22.11.mom0 ] ) . in the 1 image",
    "there are two small darker spots of higher dispersion along the northeastern edge of the ridge which may be the result of infall or outflows from the hii regions seen in contours .",

    "we are not sensitive to structures greater than 1@xmath15 in extent , nor do we have short spacing information which would increase our total flux .",

    "a mean optical depth was derived for each part of the ridge from spectra with clear hyperfine structure .",
    "a total of 8 and 10 spectra were used to determine the optical depth in the northern and southern parts of the ridge , respectively . to derive the physical parameters we used the equations outlined in paper 1 , section 3.6 .",
    "an estimation of the rotation temperature requires the 1 optical depth and the ratio of 2 to 1 brightness temperatures at that location .",

    "these mass estimates for the dense component of the ridge are reasonable even though we are not imaging all of the flux as the missing flux corresponds to more extended structures and may include some of the 50 cloud .",

    "there is also not a pronounced increase in velocity dispersion along the inner edge of the ridge in the 1 emission , though in the 2 data the velocity dispersion does increase somewhat along the inner edge ( see figure [ mom2 ] ) . if the ridge is processed and the shock wave has reached the far side of the ridge where the string of hii regions is , it is possible that the shock wave itself created the collapse which formed the hii regions .",
    "yusef - zadeh & mehringer ( 1995 ) find an h@xmath6o maser associated with one of the four sources in the hii region which could indicate that the shock from the expansion of sgr a east has reached the hii regions .",
    "there is an increase in the central velocity of the gas along the inner edge in the northern part of the ridge , as seen in the position - velocity diagrams for cuts a and b in figure [ psvl2 ] .",
    "the position - velocity diagram for the 2 emission across the densest part of the ridge , near the southernmost hii region ( cut b ) , shows both red- and blueshifting of the gas .",
    "more gas is redshifted than blueshifted , indicating that as the ridge wraps around the expanding shell , it is more behind sgr a east than in front of it ( evidence that at least part of the gas cloud lies in front of sgr a east is also seen by @xcite ) .",
    "these diagrams include emission from the small gas extension which is projected onto sgr a east . in the 1 diagram ,",
    "this gas is redshifted to 55 and 75 , while in the 2 diagram an `` o '' shape is seen .",
    "this `` o '' shape would most naturally result from an expanding bubble .",
    "the gas around the edge of the bubble has no velocity shift along the line of sight , whereas gas in the middle of the bubble is being pushed both towards and away from the observer , creating red- and blueshifted emission in the position - velocity diagram in the middle of the cut through the bubble .",
    "the spatial extent of the gas extension therefore defines the extent of the bubble . in the continuum image of sgr a east",
    "the molecular gas extension lies just inside a larger bubble in the eastern region of sgr a east .",
    "the bubble seen in the continuum image has a much larger physical extent than the bubble defined by the molecular gas extension .",
    "it is unclear whether these two features are related and interacting with one another .",
    "the morphology and kinematics of the northern and southern parts of the molecular ridge suggest different histories along the length of the streamer .",
    "figure [ color.mom0 ] shows that the morphology of the southern part of the streamer is fluffier and less confined than the northern part .",
    "in the south there are more protrusions and clumps in the gas , and the flux level is lower than in the north .",
    "while figure [ 22.11.mom0 ] indicates no clear temperature differences between the northern and southern parts , the velocity centroid image ( figure [ mom1 ] ) shows that the entire southern half of the ridge is at a lower velocity than the northern half and that the transition between the two regions is not smooth .",
    "the velocity dispersion map ( figure [ mom2 ] ) reveals that the northern half of the ridge has roughly the same dispersion throughout while the southern half has widely varying dispersions as well as regions of very high dispersion indicating perturbed gas .",
    "the position - velocity diagrams taken across the ridge ( figure [ psvl2 ] ) show a different gradient from east to west in the north and south .",
    "the diagrams taken across the northern part of the ridge show an east to west redshifting of the gas , while in the south the gradient blueshifts to the west .",
    "the northern and southern parts of the ridge are spatially and kinematically connected but are clearly being acted upon by different forces .",
    "the entire ridge is one structure , but currently there are two distinct shells expanding into the northern and southern parts separately .",
    "sgr a east is expanding into the 50 cloud , and the northern half of the molecular ridge traces this impact .",
    "there is apparently a snr to the south of sgr a east which is interacting with the southern half of the ridge as well as sgr a east and the southern streamer . in terms of its galactic coordinates",
    "the snr is `` g 359.92 -0.09 '' .",
    "images of this snr can be seen in yusef - zadeh and morris ( 1987 ) , in their figures 2 and 3 of 20 cm continuum emission , which clearly show a circular feature south of sgr a east .",
    "the snr can also be seen in pedlar et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , figure 5b , another 20 cm continuum image of sgr a east .",
    "this snr is interacting with sgr a east , pushing up on it , creating the bend in the southern edge of sgr a east seen in the color and grey - scale emission in figures [ color.mom0 ] and [ bw.snr.mom0 ] .",
    "this region where the snr is apparently confining sgr a east is exactly the location of the 1720 mhz oh maser group seen by yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "their data show a group of 8 masers all positioned just inside the southern edge of sgr a east , along the inward curve caused by the expanding snr to the south of sgr a east .",
    "yusef - zadeh et al . ( 1999 ) propose that these masers are due to the expansion of sgr a east into the 50 cloud , as the line of sight velocities of the masers are in the range 53 to 66 .",
    "our data suggest that the 50 cloud lies mainly to the east of sgr a east and not to the south , as the molecular ridge does not continue along the southern boundary of sgr a east .",
    "however we find plenty of molecular gas in the location of the masers , gas not associated with the 50 cloud but rather with the southern streamer as it transports gas from the 20 cloud to the nuclear region .",
    "the masers appear to lie at the intersection of the snr as it expands into sgr a east and the southern streamer as it moves towards the cnd .",
    "the masers may therefore arise from the expansion of the snr into the molecular gas in the southern streamer .",
    "the snr is also interacting with the 20 cloud , creating the sharp linear eastern edge of the gmc seen in the contours of these same figures .",
    "the 20 cloud does display a backwards `` c '' shape structure in its position - velocity diagrams ( paper 1 , figure 8 cut b ) , indicating that this cloud is more behind the snr than in front of it .",
    "the position - velocity diagrams of a cut taken along the lower edge of the cloud in paper 1 ( figure 8 cut c ) show a forward `` c '' structure , with the gas in the middle of the cut being blueshifted along the line of sight , where presumably the snr is impacting the 20 cloud and disrupting the gas .",
    "this interaction may have created the southern streamer . our velocity dispersion image ( figure [ mom2 ] ) shows a pronounced increase in line width in the 20 gas located near the `` wisp '' in the continuum image .",
    "the region with the increased line width has an arc morphology , continuing along the bend of the `` wisp . ''",
    "this area traces the impact of the expanding snr on the 20 cloud .",
    "this snr appears to also be interacting with the southern half of the molecular ridge , causing the clear demarcation between the northern and southern halves seen in the kinematics of the gas .",
    "the two halves of the ridge have different histories and expanding shells acting on them .",
    "the interaction between the snr and the southern part of the ridge can be seen in the position - velocity diagrams taken along the length of the ridge ( see figure [ psvl1 ] ) .",
    "these diagrams not only show large line widths for the emission in the south , but also display a hole in position - velocity space in the southern half of the diagrams between 35 and 70 .",
    "this may be a shell swept clear by the snr expanding into the southern part of the streamer .",
    "this would place the bulk of the streamer in front of the snr , and the heated high - velocity emission at @xmath2070 would be redshifted emission from the streamer that is being pushed away from the observer along the line of sight , on the far side of the snr .",
    "the u - shaped feature in the 1.3 mm image ( figure [ dust.mom0 ] ) may well be a tilted circular swath of dust from the 20 cloud wrapping around the snr and projected into a u - shape along the line of sight , possibly connecting up with the southern tip of the ridge .",
    "the southern part of the ridge may be material from the 20 cloud that has been impacted by the expanding snr , pushing it away from the core of the gmc .    given the masses of the ridge and the 20 cloud , how feasible is it that a snr could move these features by the 20 shift we observe in the position - velocity diagrams ? assuming equipartition of energy in the snr , roughly half the 10@xmath24 ergs released in the explosion would be converted to kinetic energy .",
    "using the mass derived in table 1 for the southern part of the ridge , 0.5 10@xmath24 ergs would be able to displace gas in the southern ridge by 35 . using the mass derived for the northern part of the 20 cloud",
    "as reported in paper 1 , a snr could shift the gas by 15 .",
    "these numbers are consistent with the observed velocity shifts , so that it is entirely feasible for a typical snr to cause the observed velocity shifts and increased line widths .",
    "the northern part of the ridge shows a 20 velocity shift due to the expansion of sgr a east . using the derived mass of the northern part of the ridge",
    ", we estimate that 4.5 10@xmath25 ergs of kinetic energy would be required to cause this movement of the 50 cloud , well within the kinetic energy limit of a typical snr .",
    "it does not appear that the entire molecular ridge was created by the expansion of sgr a east into the 50 cloud , resulting in a narrow shocked region of gas .",
    "while the gas in the northern part of the ridge traces the denser parts of the 50 cloud , including the western edge of the gmc that sgr a east is expanding into , the ridge continues to the south past sgr a east and is being acted upon by other forces in this region .",
    "the gas in the southern part of the ridge may have originated in the 20 cloud and been pushed to its present position by the expanding snr .",
    "if the narrowness of the ridge in the south is real , in the absence of apparent confinment mechanisms , it could suggest a primordial filamentary structure .      with our new data we are able to put constraints on the line - of - sight locations of several of the features at the galactic center and begin to build a 3-d model of the region .",
    "figure [ cartoon ] is a schematic drawing of the large - scale features in the central 15 pc of the galaxy , with positions shown along the line of sight from the sun where east is up and west is down .",
    "the 20 cloud is in front of the nuclear region as seen from the redshift to the north in the velocity gradient along the southern streamer ( paper 1 ) .",
    "this places the cnd behind the 20 cloud , and the 20 cloud in front of the nuclear region .",
    "sgr a east is behind sgr a west , as sgr a west is seen in absorption against sgr a east at 90 cm ( figures 5 and 7 in pedlar et al .",
    "the 50 cloud is to the east of and slightly behind sgr a east , as indicated in our position - velocity diagrams where there is redshifted emission from the interaction with sgr a east but no corresponding blueshifted emission ( figure [ psvl1 ] ) . along the molecular ridge",
    "there is a velocity gradient that redshifts to the north , placing the northern part of the ridge further away from the sun along the line of sight than the southern part .",
    "the snr to the south of sgr a east is interacting with the southern part of the molecular ridge which connects to the 50 cloud to the north .",
    "the snr is also interacting with the southern edge of sgr a east , as well as the eastern edge of the 20 cloud .",
    "the angular size of the snr is about 3.5@xmath15 , which corresponds to roughly 8.5 pc ( at a distance of 8.5 kpc ) , so that sgr a east and the 20 cloud have to be within 8.5 pc of each other along the line of sight .",
    "the two streamers we image seem to be part of a larger , connected gas cloud complex , as seen from the extended emission in the 1.3 mm map and the connections imaged by other groups between the two gmcs in the region .",
    "we are missing zero - spacing information in our data , which essentially filters out any structures greater than 1@xmath15 in size in our maps as well as causes the negative trenches around the strongest emission .",
    "in addition , nh@xmath0 only traces the densest gas in the system , so we are not sensitive to less dense gas which may be connecting the streamers . in order to understand the nature of the large - scale structure of molecular gas at the galactic center",
    ", we must compare our maps to the single - dish 1.3 mm image ( assuming that the dust and gas are well - mixed ) and examine surveys of molecular clouds in the region .",
    "gsten , walmsley , & pauls ( 1981 ) argue that the 20 cloud and 50 cloud are not only bound to each other but are condensations in a larger complex of 5 gas clouds beginning in the south with the 20 cloud and extending almost 2 degrees north of the nucleus .",
    "the recent nobeyama cs @xmath26=1 - 0 survey ( tsuboi , handa & ukita 1999 ) shows a large - scale ridge of gas extending along the galactic plane for @xmath270.5@xmath10 at negative latitudes from sgr a@xmath1 .",
    "the 20 cloud and 50 cloud appear to be part of this large structure .",
    "one obvious question about this structure is why it is offset to negative latitudes and why there is little corresponding emission at positive latitudes .",
    "it is possible that the two streamers we image together make up a tilted ring with respect to our line of sight .",
    "a ring - like structure if it were in the plane of the galaxy would appear as a linear structure from our point of view in the disk , so that morphology alone would not necessarily indicate the presence of a ring ; kinematic evidence is needed .",
    "our velocity coverage is limited , sensitive to emission with radial velocities of -35 to 100 .",
    "the nobeyama survey paper ( @xcite ) presents a position - velocity diagram ( their figure 2b ) centered on sgr a@xmath1 summed over 16@xmath15 in latitude which shows half of a ring - type structure in the central 0.5@xmath10 with emission at positive velocities ranging from 0 to 90 .",
    "there is a small region of emission at -20 opposing this semi - complete ring which may complete the circle .",
    "a vla 5-field mosaic of the inner 15 pc of the galaxy in 1 and 2 emission reveal two long , narrow streamers running roughly along the galactic plane , each tracing connections between continuum emission in the nucleus and nearby gmcs .",
    "the southern streamer is carrying gas from the 20 cloud to the cnd ( see paper 1 ) .",
    "the other streamer , called the molecular ridge , traces the dense parts of the 50 cloud , including the core and much of the southern part of the gmc , and wraps around the eastern edge of sgr a east .",
    "the expansion of sgr a east into the 50 cloud is seen as a `` c''-shaped structure in position - velocity diagrams of the northern part of the molecular ridge .",
    "there is a velocity gradient along the length of the entire streamer with the gas being redshifted to the north , similar to the gradient seen in the southern streamer connecting the 20 cloud to the cnd .",
    "the molecular ridge closely follows the arc of the sgr a east continuum emission and continues south past sgr a east towards the 20 cloud .",
    "the gas in the southern part of the ridge is perturbed , showing heating and increased line widths , likely the result of an interaction with a snr south of sgr a east .",
    "this snr appears to be impacting the 20 cloud and sgr a east as well , placing these features within 10 pc of each other along the line of sight .",
    "our velocity information allows us to place the 20 cloud in front of the cnd and sgr a west , as well as the 50 cloud behind sgr a east .",

    "<S> we report the results of a 5-field mosaic of the central 15pc of the galaxy in the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines of nh@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> two narrow filaments or streamers are seen running parallel to the galactic plane . </S>",
    "<S> the southern streamer appears to carry gas directly toward the nuclear region from the 20 cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the eastern streamer , which we will denote the molecular ridge , appears to be the denser part of the 50 cloud which lies immediately east of the sgr a east complex and extends in the south towards the 20 cloud . </S>",
    "<S> this ridge of gas carries the kinematical signatures of interactions with sgr a east as well as a snr which lies south of the galactic center . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk motion of the gas , the enhanced line widths , and the heating of the molecular material all suggest an active evolutionary phase for the gas immediately adjacent to the nucleus . </S>"
