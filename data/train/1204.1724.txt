    "recently , the technology for observation and manipulation of quantum systems involving the interaction between light and matter is developed with increasing speed and new experimental tools are becoming available .",
    "remarkable features of such developments include real - time observation @xcite , single - photon generation @xcite and so on .",
    "then , as for the theoretical side , it would be desirable to develop a formalism to simulate dynamical phenomena observed by such experiments treating light and matter and the interaction between them as accurately as possible .",
    "that is , by quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "qed is probably the most successful fundamental physical theory we have .",
    "it is the theory of electrically charged particles and photons and interactions between them , taking the form of quantum theory of fields .",
    "its accurate predictions include the lamb shift of the energy levels of the hydrogen atom and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron .",
    "in addition to such stationary properties , it can also predict dynamical properties like the cross section for the electron - positron scattering ( bhabha scattering ) to a great accuracy .",
    "the successes are due to the development of the method to compute the qed interaction as a perturbation .",
    "the success of the perturbative approach , in turn , owes much to the capability of preparing the asymptotic states as the unperturbed states ( and of course to the renormalizability ) .",
    "it has been long since such formalism was established @xcite",
    ".    however , use of the asymptotic states and subsequently the @xmath0-matrix formulation has shortcomings when we would like to know the step - by - step time evolution of the quantum system employing qed .",
    "this is because it just describes the transition between infinite past (  in - state \" ) and infinite future (  out - state \" ) .",
    "although it works fine for calculations of cross sections of scattering processes or energy shifts of bound states , it can not be used for simulating the time evolution of the quantum system .",
    "hence , so far , simulations of time evolution of the quantum system involving light and matter are performed using the time - dependent schrdinger or dirac equation with classical electromagnetic fields ( _ i.e. _ semi - classical treatment ) @xcite or using a quantized photon field with the very much simplified matter part ( so that the interaction between the photon and matter is introduced somewhat in an _ ad hoc _ manner ) @xcite .",
    "it is true that these approximations are appropriate for a wide range of systems .",
    "for example , the former treatment is reasonable for a photon field produced by laser and the latter treatment for a system in cavity qed .",
    "we consider , however , it is of great importance to develop a simulation method based on qed in the form of quantum field theory , and without recourse to the perturbative approach . besides the non - perturbative time evolution scheme , what we wish to add to the standard qed framework is the atomic nucleus .",
    "this is because , contrary to the high - energy physics application , the existence of the atomic nuclei is essential for atomic and molecular science in which we are interested .",
    "we would like to have a field theoretic qed formalism which is applicable to low energy phenomena such as chemical reactions and photoionization process . in this paper , as has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we include the atomic nucleus degree of freedom in the framework of the rigged qed .",
    "the rigged qed @xcite is a theory which has been proposed to treat dynamics of charged particles and photons in atomic and molecular systems in a quantum field theoretic way .",
    "in addition to the ordinary qed which is lorentz invariant with dirac ( electron ) field and u(1 ) gauge ( photon ) field , schrdinger fields which represent atomic nuclei are added . in this way ,",
    "dynamics of nuclei and their interaction with photons can be treated in a unified manner .",
    "incidentally , we here note on semantics of the word  rigged \" .",
    "it has a nautical connotation as in the phrase  fully rigged ship \" and means  equipped \" .",
    "namely , the rigged qed is  qed equipped with schrdinger fields \" as we just described above .    including the atomic nucleus degrees of freedom as quantum fields is crucial . since we would like to treat the interaction between an electron and an atomic nuclei or between two nuclei as the one which is mediated by the quantized photon field ( not by the classical electromagnetic field ) , we need to express the atomic nuclei as quantum fields",
    "then , it is necessary to compute the interaction non - perturbatively due to the existence of the bound states .",
    "although this is a difficult task to achieve , in this way , we can go beyond the quantum mechanical treatment with perturbative qed corrections .",
    "we believe such a theoretical technique opens up a way to study and predict new phenomena .",
    "to solve the dynamics of the rigged qed in a non - perturbative manner , we need different techniques from those developed for the standard qed . in this paper , as a first step toward this issue , we propose a procedure to expand the dirac field operator by solutions of the dirac equation for electrons in nuclear potential and derive time evolution equations for the electron annihilation and creation operators .",
    "similarly , the schrdinger field operators are expanded by nucleus annihilation and creation operators .",
    "then we derive time evolution equations for these annihilation and creation operators and discuss how time evolution of the operators for physical quantities can be calculated . in the end , we propose a method to approximate the operator equations by @xmath1-number equations and show some numerical results .    before ending this section , we note on our notations and conventions which will be used in this paper . they mostly follow those of refs .",
    "we use the gaussian system of units .",
    "@xmath1 denotes the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath2 the reduced planck constant and @xmath3 the electron charge magnitude ( so that @xmath3 is positive ) .",
    "we put a hat to indicate a quantum operator to distinguish it from a @xmath1-number . a dagger as a superscript is used to express hermite conjugate .",
    "a commutator is denoted by square brackets as @xmath4 \\equiv ab - ba$ ] and an anti - commutator by curly brackets as @xmath5 .",

    "the last section is devoted to our conclusion .",
    "in this section , we briefly review the general setting of rigged qed @xcite by showing its lagrangian and equations of motion for the field operators .",
    "first , we describe rigged qed in terms of the lagrangian .",
    "a part of the rigged qed lagrangian is the ordinary qed lagrangian .",
    "the lagrangian density operator of qed can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the electromagnetic field strength tensor which can be expressed by the photon field @xmath11 as @xmath12 we note here that we adopt the coulomb gauge @xmath13 in this work .",
    "@xmath14 is the lagrangian density operator for the electron @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electron mass and the dirac field operator @xmath17 represents the electron ( and positron ) .",
    "the operator with a bar on top is defined by @xmath18 .",
    "we denote the gauge covariant derivative for the electron as @xmath19    the rigged qed lagrangian is this qed lagrangian  rigged \" with the lagrangian of the atomic nuclei which are represented by schrdinger fields .",
    "we denote the schrdinger field operator for the nucleus @xmath20 by @xmath21 .",
    "this satisfies commutation relations if @xmath20 is boson and anticommutation relations if @xmath20 is fermion ( which in turn is determined by the nuclear spin of @xmath20 ) .",
    "the lagrangian density operator for the atomic nucleus @xmath20 can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the mass of the nucleus @xmath20 and the gauge covariant derivative of @xmath20 is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the @xmath20 s atomic number .",
    "thus , when we have @xmath26 types of atomic nuclei in the system , @xmath27 is the rigged qed lagrangian density operator .",
    "we note that this lagrangian has @xmath28 gauge symmetry but the lorentz symmetry is broken by @xmath29 .",
    "this , however , will not be a problem since we are not going to solve the dynamics in a lorentz covariant way .      here , we show the equations of motion for field operators , @xmath17 , @xmath21 and @xmath11 , in rigged qed .",
    "they are given by the principle of least action from the lagrangian density operators introduced above .",
    "we also define the charge density operator @xmath30 and the charge current density operator @xmath31 .",
    "we begin with the dirac field operator @xmath17 .",
    "since the  rigged \" part of the lagrangian @xmath29 does not explicitly depend on @xmath17 , the equation of motion of @xmath17 is same as one in the ordinary qed .",
    "that is @xmath32 if written covariantly , and it can be also expressed in a form @xmath33 which has the same form as a hamiltonian form of the dirac equation . in our notation of the gamma matrices , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .    as for the schrdinger field operator @xmath21",
    ", we obtain the equation of motion in the same form as the schrdinger equation of the non - relativistic quantum mechanics as @xmath36 this can also be written as @xmath37 where we use the coulomb gauge condition @xmath13 .    finally , the equations of motion for the photon field @xmath11 have the same form as the inhomogeneous maxwell equations of the classical electrodynamics . in the coulomb gauge , we have @xmath38 where @xmath30 is the charge density operator , @xmath31 is the charge current density operator .",
    "note that in the case of rigged qed , @xmath30 and @xmath31 include the contribution from atomic nuclei in addition to that of electrons .",
    "these  rigged \" charge and current are described below .",
    "the charge density operator @xmath30 is the sum of electron charge density operator @xmath39 and atomic nuclear charge density operator @xmath40 : @xmath41 where @xmath42    similarly , the charge current density operator @xmath31 is the sum of electron charge current density operator @xmath43 and atomic nuclear charge current density operator @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46    here , in passing , some notes are in order .",
    "first , the equations of continuity hold for each species , namely , @xmath47 where @xmath48 or @xmath20 .",
    "second , @xmath49 ( @xmath48 or @xmath20 ) is connected to position probability density operator @xmath50 as @xmath51 and @xmath52 is connected to velocity density operator @xmath53 as @xmath54 .",
    "in summary , the rigged charge and the rigged current are @xmath55    now , we have a closed set of time evolution equations for field operators @xmath17 , @xmath21 and @xmath11 : eqs .  , , , , and . to solve them , we rewrite them using annihilation and creation operators as is done in ordinary qed ( or other quantum field theories ) . in the next section ,",
    "we describe how we expand the field operators by the annihilation and creation operators and derive time evolution equations for them .",
    "in this section , we introduce annihilation and creation operators for each field operator and describe our expansion method .",
    "as is explained in the following , definitions for annihilation and creation operators are different from those used in the conventional qed treatment .",
    "this reflects our aim to treat dynamics of electrons , photons and atomic nuclei in atomic and molecular systems , which are bound states , in a non - perturbative manner .      in qed ,",
    "the electron is expressed by the dirac field operator @xmath17 and it is usually expanded by plane waves , which are solutions for the free dirac equation . as is well - established , this works extremely fine for the mostly considered qed processes which are represented by scattering cross sections .",
    "this is because those processes are described by a perturbation series to non - interacting system with the interaction mediated by photons treated as the perturbation .    in our case ,",
    "however , since molecular systems are highly non - perturbative and electrons are bounded , the same method is not likely to work .",
    "in addition , what we want to know is not the cross section , which just describes the transition between infinite past (  in - state \" ) and infinite future (  out - state \" ) , but time step - by - step evolution of the systems . to this end , we propose an alternative way to expand @xmath17 as @xmath56 ,   \\label{eq : psi_expand } \\\\",
    "\\hat{\\psi}^\\dagger(ct , \\vec{r } ) = \\sum_{n=1}^{n_d } \\left [ \\hat{e}_n^\\dagger(t ) \\psi_n^{\\dagger ( + ) } ( \\vec{r } ) + \\hat{f}_n(t ) \\psi_n^{\\dagger ( -)}(\\vec{r } ) \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath57/@xmath58 is the electron annihilation / creation operator , @xmath59/@xmath60 is the positron annihilation / creation operator and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) are the four - component wave functions of the electron ( the positron ) , which are solutions of the time - independent dirac equation for a particle in a nucleus field .",
    "concretely , @xmath63 can be considered as the @xmath64-th molecular orbitals which are obtained by solving the four - component dirac hartree - fock equation for the system and @xmath65 is the number of the basis set .",
    "we note that this expansion of the field operator is similar to the furry representation ( picture ) of ordinary qed @xcite in a sense that it uses the solutions of the dirac equation in an external field . however",
    ", the annihilation / creation operators in the furry representation do not depend on time ( so it can be considered as a variant of the interaction picture ) whereas those in our expansion carry all the time - dependence of the field operator .",
    "in other words , we adopt to work in heisenberg picture .",
    "since we wish to solve the dynamics of the system in a non - perturbative manner , the use of interaction picture does not make our problem easier .    before proceeding further , to make equations below less cluttered",
    ", we introduce our notation for the annihilation / creation operators and the electron / positron wavefunctions .",
    "we define @xmath66 and @xmath67 note that the positron creation operator does not have a dagger as superscript in our notation .",
    "then the field operator expansion eq .   can be written as @xmath68 and orthonormality of the wavefunctions can be expressed as @xmath69 the anti - commutation relation can be written by @xmath70 and anti - commutators of other combinations are zero . also ,",
    "for later use , we define the electron excitation operator @xmath71      we expand the schrdinger field operator @xmath21 for the atomic nucleus @xmath20 by the nucleus annihilation operator @xmath72 and creation operator @xmath73 as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a set of orthonormal functions @xmath76 the commutation relation for @xmath72 and @xmath73 is @xmath77 = \\delta_{ij}$ ] and the anti - commutation relation is @xmath78 . for the other combinations , ( anti-)commutators are zero . which of them is imposed depends on the @xmath20 s nuclear spin .",
    "if @xmath20 has ( half-)integer spin , the ( anti-)commutation relation is imposed .    as is done for the electron case",
    ", we define the nucleus excitation operator @xmath79 for the later convenience .      in qed ,",
    "the photon is expressed by a vector field operator @xmath11 with @xmath28 gauge symmetry . in the standard qed treatment , the quantization",
    "is performed to free electromagnetic field and the interaction with the electron is taken into account as a perturbation .",
    "although this is not the way we try to solve the dynamics of the system as mentioned previously , since we are going to use the expression of the quantized free field as a part of @xmath11 , we begin by showing its expression .",
    "we call this @xmath80 to distinguish from the total @xmath11 . in the coulomb gauge , as is commonly done when quantizing the electromagnetic field ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we have @xmath81 , \\label{eq : aradvec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 is the annihilation operator of the photon with momentum @xmath83 and helicity @xmath84 and @xmath85 is the polarization vector .",
    "the photon annihilation / creation operators satisfy the commutation relation @xmath86 = \\delta(\\vec{p}-\\vec{p}\\ , ' ) \\delta_{\\sigma \\sigma'},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and commutators of the other combinations are zero . as for the polarization vector ,",
    "when we take the photon momentum in the polar coordinate as @xmath87 ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) , we have @xmath91 where the double sign corresponds to @xmath92 .",
    "we note that @xmath93 and @xmath94 by construction satisfy maxwell equations and with the right - hand - sides being zero ( @xmath95 equations for free fields ) .    to solve the dynamics of the system non - perturbatively , we take advantage of the fact that the formal solutions of the inhomogeneous maxwell equations and are known from the classical electrodynamics @xcite",
    ". we shall employ the strategy to express @xmath11 by such solutions @xcite .",
    "as for the first inhomogeneous maxwell equation , since it only contains the scalar potential @xmath96 , its solution is readily written by the sum of the solution of eq .",
    "with the right - hand - side being zero and the particular solution of eq .  .",
    "the former is @xmath93 which is zero ( eq .  ) and the latter is known as the solution of the poisson equation .",
    "thus , @xmath97    as for the second inhomogeneous maxwell equation , we can make it simpler by decomposing the current @xmath31 into the transversal component @xmath98 and the longitudinal component @xmath99 as @xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "this transforms eq .   into two equations each involving only @xmath96 or @xmath103 @xmath104 since we have already found @xmath105 as eq .  , eq .",
    "tells us @xmath99 , which in turn gives the right - hand - side of eq .   by @xmath106 .",
    "then we can obtain the solution of eq .   by the sum of the solution of eq .   with the right - hand - side being zero and the particular solution of eq .  .",
    "the former is @xmath94 ( eq .  )",

    "we express the charge density operator @xmath30 ( eq .  ) and the charge current density operator @xmath31 ( eq .  ) in terms of annihilation and creation operators ( or excitation operators ) which are defined in previous subsections .",
    "the expression for the electronic charge density operator can be derived by substituting eq .   into eq .  , and the atomic nucleus charge density operator by eq .   into eq .  .",
    "they give @xmath111 where @xmath112    the expression for the charge current density operator can be derived in a similar manner . from eq .  , the electronic charge current density operator is @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",

    "finally , we describe how we can calculate physical quantities from these equations taking the electronic charge density for example .",
    "the electronic charge density operator is shown in eq .  .",
    "to make the operator observable , we have to take its expectation value .",
    "since we work in the heisenberg picture as we have mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : expansion ] , the operator is sandwiched by time - independent initial bra and ket .",
    "let @xmath182 be such a ket vector which is constructed by multiplying the vacuum @xmath183 by the creation operators at the initial time in an appropriate manner for a desired initial condition .",

    "the difficulty would increase very rapidly as the time steps grow .",
    "we consider such brute force computation is important to obtain as exact results as possible and it may not be impossible to do so employing recent developments in the field of computer algebra @xcite . at this stage",
    ", however , it is more important to look for a method to truck the time evolution of the physical quantities based on eqs .   and with suitable approximations .",
    "we will discuss such a method in next section .",
    "at the end of the previous section , we have pointed out that the excitation operator equations of the rigged qed , eqs .   and , are practically impossible to solve by the present computational technology .",
    "we therefore propose an approximation method , which is described in this section .",
    "we also show a result of numerical calculation based on that approximation for a hydrogen atom .",
    "we begin by introducing density matrices for electrons and atomic nuclei .",
    "they are defined by the expectation values ( sec .",
    "[ sec : evolution_exphys ] ) of the corresponding excitation operators and we denote them as @xmath189 and @xmath190 respectively .",
    "namely , the electron density matrix @xmath189 is @xmath191 and the atomic nucleus density matrix @xmath190 is @xmath192    the first step of our approximation is to replace @xmath128 and @xmath126 by their expectation values , which are denoted by @xmath193 using the density matrices , they are expressed as @xmath194 where @xmath195 , and @xmath196    the second step is to replace @xmath197 by its expectation value .",

    "we adopt to make the equations simpler by employing further approximations .",

    "another is the born - oppenheimer approximation ( sec .",

    "with @xmath208 and @xmath209 replaced by @xmath210 and @xmath211 respectively .",
    "now , we describe our computational setups for solving time evolution of electron charge density of a hydrogen atom .",
    "the orbital functions which are used to expand the electron field operator ( sec .",
    "[ sec : expansion_e ] ) are obtained by the publicly available dirac 10 code @xcite .",
    "the dirac - coulomb hamiltonian and the sto-3 g basis set are used . note that in this basis set , the electron density matrix is @xmath212 matrix whose components denote electron ( @xmath213 ) , its kramers partner ( @xmath214 ) , positron ( @xmath215 ) and its kramers partner ( @xmath216 ) .",
    "the initial state for the electron is taken to be the ground state . in terms of the electron density matrix , at the initial time , @xmath217 and the other components",
    "are set to be zero . as for the initial state for the photon",

    "we work in the atomic units so that @xmath224 and @xmath225 . the 1a.u",
    ".  of time corresponds to @xmath226s or @xmath227as .    as is described in sec .",

    "the common feature of these results is the oscillatory behavior . from the visual inspection of the figures , there are two types of oscillations .",
    "first , we see very rapid oscillations with the period of about @xmath231a.u . in all of figs .",
    "[ fig : plot_norad]-[fig : plot_p40 ] .",
    "second , as is seen in figs .  [ fig : plot_p20 ] and [ fig : plot_p40 ] , there are oscillations with longer period which modulate the rapid oscillations .",
    "they have the period of roughly @xmath232a.u and @xmath233a.u in figs .",
    "[ fig : plot_p20 ] and [ fig : plot_p40 ] respectively .",
    "these numbers suggest the origins of the oscillations .",
    "the period of rapid ones is very close to the period which is determined from mass scales of electron and positron , that is , @xmath234 .",
    "the longer periods seen in figs .  [ fig : plot_p20 ] and [ fig : plot_p40 ] are very close to the period which is determined from the initial photon momentum , @xmath235 , giving @xmath236 and @xmath237 for @xmath238 and 20 respectively .",
    "the interpretation of the latter oscillations is that they are caused by the initial photon state which operates as the external oscillating electromagnetic field .",
    "technically , they originate from the third term of eq .   and the time scale of the oscillations is easily read off from eq .  .",
    "as for the former rapid oscillations , since it has the period of twice the mass of electron ( or positron ) , it can be interpreted as the fluctuations originated from virtual electron - positron pair creations .",
    "the numerical origin is of course the mass term , eq .",
    ", in the first term of eq .  .",
    "to see this electron - positron oscillations more explicitly , in fig .",
    "[ fig : plotdm13_norad ] , we plot the time evolution of @xmath239-component of the electron density matrix in the case of no photon in the initial state .",
    "( note that @xmath213 denotes electron and @xmath215 positron as explained earlier . )",
    "we see the oscillations with the period same as those in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot_norad ] .",
    "although some of the other components exhibit similar oscillatory behavior , their amplitudes are much smaller and almost all of the contribution to the oscillations come from the @xmath239-component .",
    "in this paper , we have discussed how we formulate time evolution of physical quantities in the framework of the rigged qed treating non - perturbatively the interactions among electrons , atomic nuclei and photons .",
    "we have defined the time - dependent annihilation / creation operators for the electron and the atomic nucleus from corresponding field operators by expanding them by appropriate functions of spatial coordinates .",
    "the photon fields have been shown to expressed by the photon annihilation / creation operators of the free photon field and those of the electron and the atomic nucleus .",
    "this enabled us to include the interactions mediated by the photon field in a non - perturbative manner .",
    "we then have derived the time evolution equations for the excitation operators of the electron and the atomic nucleus and sketched how physical quantities can be computed from them .",
    "we have pointed out that the last parts of the procedure are very computationally demanding . solving the coupled evolution equations for the electron and nucleus excitation operators by a finite difference method in time",
    "requires sophisticated coding technique due to non - commutativity of the operators .",
    "the existence of the retarded potential makes the time evolution method more difficult . also , since the coefficients of the equations involve spatial integration of up to six dimensions , their computation is very time - consuming .",
    "after that , similar difficulty of non - commutative algebra lies in computing expectation values of the time - evolved excitation operators to obtain time - evolved physical quantities .",
    "this is somewhat alleviated by the use of the wick s theorem but it still requires large computational resource even with small number of time steps .",
    "it is true that such brute force evaluation can be carried out for a few time steps for a small system and would be feasible in future for longer time scale and larger systems considering the recent development in computer science and technology .",
    "also , it is certainly meaningful to obtain accurate results in such a way .",
    "however , at this beginning stage , we consider it is more important to look for approximation methods to truck the time evolution of the physical quantities without too much computational time .",
    "therefore , we have proposed a method to approximate the time evolution equations of the operators by replacing some operators with their expectation value in the evolution equations . in other words , in an exact sense , we have to compute expectation value after the operators are evolved , but , in our approximation , some operators are replaced by their expectation values and expectation values are evolved .",
    "although this method has room for improvement , we consider this is a good point to start .",
    "in fact , the numerical result of the time evolution of charge density of a hydrogen atom exhibits the oscillatory feature which is considered to originate from the electron - positron pair creations .",
    "this shows that our simplified way of computation can reproduce one of the most notable features of qed . even within the framework of this approximation",
    ", there are a lot more works to be done . in our near future work ,",
