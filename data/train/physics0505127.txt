    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is a proton - proton collider with 14  tev centre of mass energy and design luminosity of @xmath4 .",
    "atlas is a lhc experiment designed to maximise the discovery potential for new physics phenomena such as higgs bosons and supersymmetric particles , while keeping the capability of high - accuracy measurements of known objects such as heavy quarks and gauge bosons .",
    "a very challenging mass region for higgs discovery at the lhc lies between the limit reached by the lep2 detectors at 114.4  gev  @xcite and @xmath5  gev . in this region ,",
    "the decay @xmath6 is one of the most promising discovery channels .",
    "its observation requires an excellent performance of the electromagnetic calorimeter in terms of energy resolution , precision of angular measurement and particle identification capability .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter in the atlas experiment is a lead - liquid argon sampling calorimeter with accordion shaped absorbers and electrodes .",
    "liquid argon technology has been chosen because of its intrinsic linear behaviour as function of the deposited energy , stability of the response and radiation tolerance .    in the following",
    ", the beam direction defines the @xmath7 axis , and the @xmath8 plane is transverse to the beam direction .",
    "the azimuthal angle @xmath9 is measured around the beam axis , and the polar angle @xmath10 is the angle from the beam axis ; the pseudorapidity is defined as @xmath11 .",
    "the calorimeter has a cylindrical symmetry with a longitudinal segmentation along the radius of the cylinder and transverse segmentation along the pseudorapidity @xmath12 .",
    "the central part covering @xmath13 is housed in a separate barrel cryostat .",
    "the two end - caps cover the region of @xmath14 .",
    "the transverse momentum @xmath15 is measured in the @xmath8 plane .",
    "the optimisation of the longitudinal and transverse segmentation of the calorimeter involves balancing performance issues such as electron and photon identification , position resolution , and pile - up and electronic noise contributions against cost and technical constraints such as routing of the signals from the calorimeter volume .",
    "the dominant backgrounds for the electrons and photons identification arise from the production of hadronic jets .",
    "the segmentations of the calorimeter  @xcite , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : segmentation ] , allow a measurement of the shower shape that are an essential tool in background rejection .",
    "in addition , the rejection of spatially isolated signals from high-@xmath15 @xmath1 s coming from hadronic jet fragmentation is especially important : atlas design goal calls for a factor of three rejection of @xmath1 at a single - photon efficiency of 90% .    at the lhc design luminosity , the beam spread in the @xmath7",
    "coordinate is about a few centimetres .",
    "the beam spread contributes to the angular resolution of the the @xmath16 invariant mass . in order to minimise its effects",
    ", the photon direction has to be measured in @xmath12 , with a resolution of about 50  mrad/@xmath17 . in the @xmath9 direction ,",
    "the interaction point is known with a precision of a few microns in the @xmath8 plane , and the azimuthal angle measurement is well constrained .",
    "all this requires a fine - grained position - sensitive device to perform angular measurements and discriminate against the two merged photons from the @xmath1 decay .",
    "this is done by segmenting the first longitudinal sampling of the barrel ( front compartment ) into narrow cells of size @xmath18 . for the end - cap ,",
    "the segmentation of the first sampling is @xmath19 .",
    "the other two compartments ( middle and back ) are segmented with towers of size @xmath20 in the second ( third ) sampling .        in this paper",
    "the performances of barrel and end - cap modules , with respect to the @xmath12 segmentation of their first compartment , are presented .",
    "the results are based on analyses of test - beam data taken in 2000 with barrel module 0 ( for the @xmath1 rejection calculation , section  [ sec : gammapi0rej ] ) and between 2001 and 2002 with series modules .",
    "a detailed description of barrel and end - cap modules of the atlas electromagnetic calorimeter , and of the signal reconstruction techniques can be found in refs  @xcite .",
    "two production modules , p13 for the barrel calorimeter and ecc1 for the end - cap were tested in the cern h6 and h8 beam lines during several months of tests during 2001 - 2002 .",
    "the test setup is similar to the one described in refs  @xcite .",
    "the calorimeter performance was tested using secondary or tertiary electron and pion beams , with momenta ranging from 20 to 245  gev / c for barrel modules and from 20 to 150  gev / c for end - cap modules .",
    "the beam lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : electron_beam ] ) were equipped with three scintillators ( s1 to s3 ) in front of the calorimeter for triggering purposes .",
    "four multi - wire proportional chambers(bc1 to bc4 ) allowed to determine the beam impact point at the calorimeter with a resolution of about 250  @xmath21 m in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "the size of the last two scintillators , @xmath22 , defined the beam acceptance .",
    "cryostats housing the modules were mounted on remotely controlled rails that allowed movements in @xmath12 and @xmath9 while ensuring incident angles similar to the ones expected in atlas for all positions .",
    "a 3@xmath23 lead absorber , a pion counter , a 5@xmath24 iron absorber and a muon counter were placed downstream of the cryostat .",
    "@xmath12-scans were done at an electron energy of 245  gev for the barrel and 120  gev for the end - cap .",
    "energy scans at fixed positions were also carried out .      the calorimeter response to the incident photons was measured using the prototype module m0 . the beam line arrangement is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : photon_beam ] .",
    "electrons , with a momentum of 50 or 180  gev / c impinged on a @xmath25 lead target and produced bremsstrahlung photons .",
    "a 4  @xmath26 magnet , placed downstream of the target swept away the charged tracks from the photon trajectory .",
    "the unaffected photon beam was incident on the module at an angle and position corresponding to @xmath27 and @xmath28  rad .",
    "a beam chamber , bc1 , was placed before the target and two more , bc2-bc3 , downstream of the magnet , in order to reject out of time counts .",
    "beam trigger was provided by a coincidence of signal from two scintillator counters s1 and s2 .",
    "this second counter could be displaced in the transverse direction with respect to the beam line in order to trigger on deflected electrons of different energy .",
    "a @xmath29 thick converter , followed by scintillator s3 to detect photon conversions into @xmath30 pairs , was placed in the photon beam to enrich the data sample of events in which no more than one photon was present ; its effect is described more in detail in section  [ sec : syst ] .",
    "the calorimeter was positioned 25  m downstream of the target .",
    "it was found that about @xmath31 of material was present along the beamline and acted as additional source of photons  @xcite . in order to estimate the amount of events",
    "for which more than one photon was present , a sample of photons produced with the 180  gev beam was also recorded without the photon converter .",
    "positively charged pion beams of 20 and 40  gev / c momentum , provided by the cern h8 beamline , were used .",
    "the beam impinged on series barrel module p15 of the calorimeter at fixed incident angle and position corresponding to @xmath32 and @xmath33  rad .",
    "in addition to the usual test - beam setup , a erenkov counter was placed in the beam line and filled with he gas at the pressure of @xmath34  bar . the momentum threshold for a pion to generate erenkov",
    "light was 80  gev / c and the counter provided an efficient discrimination of incident pions and electrons at 20 and 40  gev / c beam momenta .",
    "the data were processed using the signal processing and pattern recognition software emtb  @xcite to calculate the position and polar angle resolutions . the event energy and position",
    "were reconstructed using the optimal filtering technique  @xcite , with a cluster size @xmath35 of @xmath36 cells for the front and @xmath37 cells for the middle layer .",
    "random , muon- and pion - like events were discarded using trigger and scintillator information . to correct for the energy loss upstream of the calorimeter ,",
    "the energy deposited in the presampler was weighted by a factor @xmath38 when calculating the total energy deposited ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "longitudinal energy leakage induces a deterioration of the energy resolution , therefore a weight @xmath40 was also applied to the energy deposited in the back sampling :    @xmath41    the parameters @xmath38 and @xmath40 were obtained by minimising the energy resolution for every @xmath12 position  @xcite .",
    "@xmath12-scans with cells at @xmath28  rad for the barrel and @xmath42  rad for the end - cap were taken to study the variation of the position resolution in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "cells for which no optimal filtering coefficients were available were excluded from the analysis ; the scanned region was therefore reduced to @xmath43 ( barrel ) and @xmath44 ( end - cap ) . in addition , cells in the barrel at @xmath33  rad , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where a large number of events was accumulated , were used to evaluate the variation of the position resolution with respect to the impact point in the cell .",
    "pions in the beam are expected to deposit lower energy in the calorimeter than electrons . in order to improve the pion rejection",
    ", it was required that the peak value of the energy distribution fitted ( fig .",
    "[ fig : enerfit ] ) to a gaussian shape with peak value @xmath47 and width @xmath48 is in the range @xmath49 .",
    "additional constraints were imposed on the timing signal coming from the four beam chambers to guarantee a good track reconstruction and rejection of accidental background .",
    "finally , the barycenters of the reconstructed showers in @xmath12 and @xmath9 were required to be within the central cell of a 3@xmath503 cluster in the middle compartment .",
    "about 12% of the events for the barrel module and 9% of the events for the end - cap module remained after all these requirements .",
    "the electron impact position of the beam particle on the calorimeter was calculated performing a linear fit through the points identified by the beam chambers in each event .",
    "the resolution for each chamber , obtained from the distribution of the residuals , was used to estimate the uncertainty in the track extrapolation to the front face of the calorimeter .",
    "fitted tracks were extrapolated to the shower barycenter in both front and middle compartments . except in the case where the electron track originated at the virtual atlas interaction point",
    ", the different depths of the shower barycenters and the electrodes geometry resulted in different extrapolated values of @xmath12 in the front and middle compartments .",
    "the chambers resolution was estimated to be about 250  @xmath21 m ( i.e. @xmath51 in units of pseudorapidity ) for both beamlines .",
    "two methods were used to calculate the cluster @xmath12 position in the calorimeter .    in the first method , the position of an electron cluster in the samplings is the energy - weighted average of the positions of the cells included in the cluster . due to the steeply falling lateral profile of the em shower ,",
    "the finite granularity of the calorimeter induces a systematic shift of the measured shower barycenter towards the centre of the cell .",
    "this effect is stronger in the @xmath12 direction , while the energy sharing is larger in the @xmath9 direction because of the accordion shape . in test - beam data , the shower barycenter position measured by the calorimeter",
    "can be compared to the position measured by the beam chambers .",
    "the resulting distortions of the measured positions were fitted and used to correct the barycenter position .",
    "the corrections depended on the beam energy and the @xmath52 direction .",
    "the second method took into account the exponential transverse profile of the shower . here",
    "the average of the positions of the cells included in the cluster was calculated by weighting the individual contributions with the logarithm of the cell energy , according to  @xcite :    @xmath53    where the index @xmath54 runs over cells belonging to a given cluster in a compartment . in this case ,    @xmath55    @xmath56 is the total energy deposited in a given compartment , and @xmath57 is a parameter that defines a minimum fraction of the shower energy in the cell and sets the relative importance of the tails of the shower in the weighting procedure . with this reconstruction",
    "the position distortion practically disappears and @xmath58 can be directly compared with @xmath59 without further corrections .",
    "a comparison of @xmath58 versus @xmath59 distributions for the cases of standard and logarithmic weighting ( lw ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : sshape ] .     versus @xmath59 distribution for standard and logarithmic weighting in the barrel front compartment at @xmath60  rad , @xmath61  gev .",
    "the bias in @xmath58 disappears when using formula  [ eq : logw ] for the weighting and the points are distributed along a line of unit slope . ]    here , the value of @xmath57 was chosen such that it gives a minimum for the position resolution . for the barrel module ,",
    "the best value was found to be 2.0 for the front and 4.4 for the middle compartment at @xmath28  rad . for the end - cap module , at @xmath42",
    "rad in the front compartment , the value of @xmath57 was 2.2 .",
    "a plot showing the variation of the resolution for the front and middle compartments as a function of @xmath57 at @xmath28  rad is presented in fig .",

    "it was found that the position correction done using lw for the middle compartment gave results worse by 20 to 60%  @xcite at 245  gev .",
    "the case is different for the front compartment ; its finer segmentation with respect to the middle compartment implied a much smaller number of events populating a given strip .",
    "the fits were therefore more difficult to perform and only possible for the two strips nearest to the impact point of the electron .",
    "for these strips it was found that the two weighting methods gave comparable results . in order to analyse the highest possible number of strips , it was decided to use the lw method to correct the reconstruction bias in the front compartment .",
    "geant3 simulation  @xcite , adapted to reproduce atlas test - beam events , was used to generate monte carlo samples for the barrel module .",
    "for each cell @xmath62  rad , about 3000 events were generated .",
    "three samples at @xmath63  rad containing about 10000 events were also used to study cells for which a large number of events was available at @xmath64 and @xmath46 .",
    "the monte carlo samples were analysed with the emtb package in which the clustering routine was modified to take into account electronic noise and cross - talk . the cell noise level for presampler , front ,",
    "middle and back compartments was set to 45 , 15 , 30 and 25  mev respectively .",

    "for the end - cap , the fit was performed directly to the data .",
    "the corrected value for the barycenter was then compared with the one obtained by track extrapolation .",
    "the resulting @xmath68 distribution was fitted with a sum of two gaussians , in order to take into account the non - gaussian tails due to residual accidental hits in the beam chambers , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gg ] .",

    "the finer granularity of the front compartment results in a better position resolution . using the value of the resolution at small @xmath12 for the barrel and the appropriate extrapolation distance for the two compartments , it was possible to estimate the resolution as @xmath70 m for the front and @xmath71 m for the middle compartment . in the end - cap ,",
