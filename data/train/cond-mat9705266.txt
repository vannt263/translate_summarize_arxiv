    "consider a quantum system on an infinite lattice described by the hamiltonian @xmath9 , with @xmath10 a dimensionless coupling constant .",
    "for any reasonable @xmath10 , all observable properties of the ground state of @xmath11 will vary smoothly as @xmath10 is varied",
    ". however , there may be special points , like @xmath12 , where there is a non - analyticity in some property of the ground state : we identify @xmath13 as the position of a quantum phase transition . in finite lattices ,",
    "non - analyticities can only occur at level crossings ; the possibilities in infinite systems are richer as avoided level crossings can become sharp in the thermodynamic limit . in this paper",
    ", i will restrict my discussion to second order quantum transitions , or transitions in which the length and time scales over which the degrees of freedom are correlated diverge as @xmath10 approaches @xmath13 .",
    "as i will discuss below , any such quantum transition can be used to define a continuum quantum field theory ( cqft ) : the cqft has no intrinsic short - distance ( or ultraviolet ) cutoff .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to discuss some properties of @xmath14 at finite temperatures ( @xmath15 ) in the vicinity of @xmath12 , in the context of some simple , but experimentally important , models .",
    "these studies are equivalent to a determination of the finite @xmath15 crossovers of the associated cqfts .",
    "we begin by stating some basic concepts on the relationship between quantum critical points and cqft s  @xcite .",
    "as correlations become long range in time in the vicinity of the critical point , every system must be characterized by an experimentally measurable energy scale , @xmath16 which vanishes at @xmath12 .",
    "convenient choices are an energy gap , if one exists , or a stiffness of an ordered phase to changes in the orientation of an order parameter . in the models we shall consider here , @xmath16 vanishes as a power - law as @xmath10 approaches @xmath13 : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is an ultraviolet cutoff , measured in units of energy , @xmath19 is the dynamic exponent , and @xmath20 is the correlation length exponent  @xcite .",
    "from the perspective of a field theorist , the cqft associated with the quantum critical point is now defined by taking the limit @xmath21 at fixed @xmath16 ; from ( [ gg ] ) we see that , because @xmath22 , it is possible to take this limit by tuning the bare coupling @xmath10 closer and closer to the critical point as @xmath18 increases .",
    "( a condensed matter physicist would take the complementary , but equivalent , perspective of keeping @xmath18 fixed but moving closer to criticality by lowering his probe frequency @xmath23 ) . assuming the @xmath24 limit exits",
    ", the resulting cqft then contains only the energy scale @xmath16 . at non - zero temperatures",
    ", there is a second energy scale @xmath25 ; its thermodynamic properties will then be a _",
    "universal _ function of the only dimensionless ratio available@xmath26 .",
    "our study will find two regimes with very different physical properties , as sketched in fig  [ fig1 ] : there are actually two regimes of this type , one on either side of @xmath13 .",
    "correlations in this region are similar to those of the @xmath27 ground state .",
    "the low temperature creates a small density of excitations which can sometimes have significant effects at very long scales .",
    "as we are discussing universal properties of the cqft , it is implicitly assumed that all energy scales , including @xmath25 , are smaller than the upper cutoff @xmath18 which has been sent to infinity ; so we also require that @xmath28 .",
    "the thermal energy , @xmath25 , sets the scale for all physical phenomena in this region , and the system behaves as if it s couplings are at the @xmath12 critical point .",
    "we shall devote much attention to the unfamiliar and unusual properties of this region .",
    "it is perhaps worth noting explicitly why the high @xmath15 limit of the cqft can be non - trivial . a conventional high @xmath15 expansions of the lattice model @xmath11 proceeds with the series @xmath29 the successive terms in this series are well - defined and finite because of the ultraviolet cutoffs provided by the lattice .",
    "further , the series is well - behaved provided @xmath15 is larger than all other energy scales ; in particular we need @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast , the cqft was defined by the limit @xmath24 at fixed @xmath25 , @xmath16 , and , as already stated , the high @xmath15 limit of the cqft corresponds to the intermediate temperature range @xmath31 of the lattice model .",
    "it is not possible to access this temperature range by an expansion as simple as ( [ hight ] ) , and more sophisticated techniques , to be discussed here , are necessary .",
    "all of our explicit computations will be with models described by the same cqft .",
    "this is the relativistic cqft in @xmath2 spatial dimensions with imaginary time ( @xmath32 ) action @xmath33   + \\frac{u_0}{4 ! } ( \\phi_{\\alpha}^2 ) ^2 \\right\\}. \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath34 is a real scalar field , the index @xmath35 is implicitly summed over , and the action has @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "this cqft has a `` lorentz '' invariance with @xmath36 the velocity of `` light '' , and as a result the dynamic critical exponent @xmath37 .",
    "the bare `` mass '' term has been written as @xmath38 so that the @xmath27 quantum critical point is at @xmath12 , and @xmath39 measures the strength of the quartic non - linearity .",
    "the action @xmath40 can also be interpreted as the gibbs weight of a classical statistical mechanics problem in @xmath41 dimensions ( with the @xmath32 dimension of finite extent @xmath42 ) ; indeed it is nothing but the standard , thoroughly - studied @xmath43 theory which is the corner - stone of the well established theory of classical critical phenomena  @xcite .",
    "it might then appear that we can simply carry over these results to the case of the quantum - critical point , and our job is relatively straightforward .",
    "_ this is far from being the case . _",
    "the fundamental reason is that all dynamic experimental measurements are in real time ( @xmath44 ) , and we are particularly interested in the long time limit @xmath45 .",
    "while , in principle , information on these long - time correlations is related by analytic continuation to imaginary time correlations in the domain @xmath46 , in practice the continuation is an ill - posed problem , and essentially impossible to carry out .",
    "in particular , it has been shown  @xcite that the operations of expansion in @xmath47 or @xmath48 ( which are the only non - numeric tools available for analyzing @xmath40 ) , and of analytic continuation _ do not commute_. it is essential that the theory of the dynamic and transport properties of @xmath40 be formulated directly in real time , and here we shall review recent progress in this direction .",
    "it is sobering to note that there remain open questions on experimentally important observables even for the simple model @xmath40 , and we shall also note them here .",
    "a central concept in our description of the dynamic properties of @xmath40 is that of the phase relaxation time , @xmath49 .",
    "this is defined as the time over which the wave - functional of the cqft retains phase memory .",
    "we shall find that in the regions of fig  [ fig1 ] @xmath50 these relations will be shown to apply to @xmath40 , but are expected to be far more general .",
    "the missing constant in the first of these relations is a universal number which depends upon the precise definition of @xmath49 .",
    "all of the physical properties of @xmath40 will show significant crossovers at times of order @xmath49 which we shall describe .",
    "we will begin by obtaining exact results for the dynamic scaling functions of @xmath40 for the case @xmath4 , @xmath3 .",
    "the quantum physics is more transparent in a lattice hamiltonian formulation , where the properties of @xmath40 are expected to be equivalent to those of the ising chain in a transverse field ( this may be shown in a manner similar to section  [ sec : largen ] which considers @xmath51 ) .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the ising model are spins @xmath52 on the sites , @xmath53 , of a chain .",
    "in addition to their usual exchange interaction @xmath54 , there is a transverse field of strength @xmath55 which is responsible for the quantum dynamics ; thus the hamiltonian is @xmath56 like @xmath40 for @xmath3 , @xmath57 possesses a global @xmath58 symmetry : it is invariant under a unitary transformation performed by the operator @xmath59 under which @xmath60 notice that this global ising @xmath58 symmetry is present in the presence of the transverse field .",
    "a longitudinal field , coupling to @xmath61 would break the @xmath58 symmetry .",
    "the action of this symmetry correctly indicates that the operator correspondence @xmath62 maps the long distance correlators of @xmath40 and @xmath57 .",
    "we begin by examining the spectrum of @xmath57 under strong ( @xmath63 ) and weak ( @xmath64 ) coupling  @xcite .",
    "the analysis is relatively straightforward in these limits , and two very different physical pictures emerge .",
    "the exact solution , to be discussed later , shows that there is a critical point exactly at @xmath65 , but that the qualitative properties of the ground states for @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) are very similar to those for @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "one of the two limiting descriptions is therefore always appropriate , and only the critical point @xmath65 has genuinely different properties .",
    "let @xmath70 and @xmath71 denote the eigenstates of @xmath72",
    ". then @xmath73 .",
    "then at @xmath74 the ground state of @xmath57 is clearly determined by the transverse field term to be @xmath75 the values of @xmath72 on different sites are totally uncorrelated in this state , and so @xmath76 .",
    "perturbative corrections in @xmath77 will build in correlations in @xmath61 which increase in range at each order in @xmath77 ; for @xmath10 large enough these correlations are expected to remain short - ranged , and the @xmath61 correlator to decay exponentially with separation .",
    "there is thus no magnetic long - range order and this state is a `` quantum paramagnet '' .",
    "notice that this state is invariant under the @xmath58 symmetry described above .    what about the excited states ? for @xmath74 these can also be listed exactly .",
    "the lowest excited states are @xmath78 obtained by flipping the state on site @xmath53 to the other eigenstate of @xmath79 .",
    "all such states are degenerate , and we will refer to them as the `` single - particle '' states . similarly , the next degenerate manifold of states are the two - particle states @xmath80 , obtained by flipping the states at sites @xmath53 and @xmath81 , and so on to the general @xmath82-particle states . to leading order in @xmath77 , we can neglect the mixing between states between different particle number , and just study how the degeneracy within each manifold is lifted . for the one - particle states ,",
    "the exchange term in @xmath57 leads only to the off - diagonal matrix element @xmath83 which hops the ` particle ' between nearest neighbor sites . as in the tight - binding models of solid state physics , the hamiltonian is therefore diagonalized by going to the momentum space basis @xmath84 where @xmath1 is the number of sites",
    "this eigenstate has energy ( we have choosen an overall constant in @xmath57 to make the energy of the ground state zero ) @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the lowest energy one - particle state is therefore at @xmath87    now consider the two - particle states .",
    "as long as the two particles are well separated from each other , the eigenstate is formed simply by taking the tensor product of two single particle eigenstates .",
    "however these particles will collide , which will be described by a @xmath88 matrix . if we exclude the possibility of two - particle bound states ( which do not occur here ) , the total energy of the state is determined by the configuration where the particles are well separated , and is simply the sum of the single particle energies .",
    "thus the energy of a two - particle state with total momentum @xmath89 is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "notice that for a fixed @xmath89 , there is still an arbitrariness in the single particle momenta @xmath92 and so the total energy @xmath93 can take a range of values .",
    "there is thus no definite energy momentum relation , and we have instead a ` two - particle continuum ' .",
    "it should be clear , however , that the lowest energy two - particle state in the infinite system ( its `` threshold '' ) is at @xmath94 .",
    "similar considerations apply to the @xmath82-particle continua , which have thresholds at @xmath95 .    at next order in @xmath77",
    "we have to account for the mixing between states with differing numbers of particles .",
    "non - zero matrix elements like @xmath96 lead to a coupling between @xmath82 and @xmath97 particle states .",
    "it is clear that these will renormalize the one - particle energies @xmath98 .",
    "however qualitative features of the spectrum will not change , and we will still have renormalized one - particle states with a definite energy - momentum relationship , and renormalized @xmath99 particle continua with thresholds at @xmath100 .",
    "the same expansion in powers of @xmath77 can also be used to compute the two - particle @xmath88 matrix .",
    "if we consider the collision of two - particles with small momenta @xmath101 and @xmath102 , then by conservation of energy and momentum there can only be two particles in the final state , and the momenta of these particles remains @xmath101 and @xmath102 . an elementary calculation to order @xmath77 shows then",
    "that @xmath103 it can be shown that this result holds in limit of small @xmath101 , @xmath102 to all orders in @xmath77 for a large class of models like @xmath57 with further neighbor exchange .",
    "the particles under consideration , being simple spin flips , are evidently bosons which experience a short - range repulsive potential . in @xmath4",
    "any weak repulsive potential appears arbitrarily strong in the limit of low velocities , and leads to the ` unitarity limit ' phase shift of @xmath104 , which is responsible for ( [ smat ] ) .",
    "for the particular nearest neighbor model @xmath57 , it can be shown that there is no particle production in collisions at any incoming momenta @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and that ( [ smat ] ) holds to all orders in @xmath77 for all @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "this will be shown and exploited in section  [ sec : exact ] .",
    "the spectrum described above has simple , but important , consequences for the dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath105 .",
    "this is defined in imaginary time as the fourier transform into momentum and frequency of the @xmath61 correlator : @xmath106 its spectral density @xmath107 is the imaginary part of the real frequency @xmath108 , and it given by @xmath109 where the sum over @xmath86 extends over all the eigenstates of @xmath57 with energy @xmath110 . the eigenstates and energies described above",
    "allow us to simply deduce the qualitative form of @xmath111 which is sketched in fig  [ fig2 ] .",
    "= 3.0 in    the operator @xmath61 flips the state at a single site , and so the matrix element in ( [ ising2 ] ) is non - zero for the single particle states : only the state with momentum @xmath101 will contribute , and so there is an infinitely sharp delta function contribution to @xmath112 .",
    "this delta function is the `` quasiparticle peak '' and its co - efficient is the quasiparticle amplitude . at @xmath74",
    "this quasiparticle peak is the entire spectral density , but for smaller @xmath10 the quasiparticle amplitude decreases and the multiparticle states also contribute to the spectral density .",
    "the mixing between the one and three particle states discussed above , means that the next contribution to @xmath113 occurs above the 3 particle threshold @xmath114 ; because there are a continuum of such states , their contribution is no longer a delta function , but a smooth function of omega ( apart from a threshold singularity ) , as shown in fig  [ fig2 ] .",
    "similarly there are continua above higher odd number particle thresholds ; only states with odd numbers of particles contribute because the matrix element in ( [ ising2 ] ) vanishes for even numbers of particles .",
    "now the energy is dominated by the exchange term .",
    "there are two degenerate ground states at @xmath115 with the spins either all up or down ( in eigenstates of @xmath61 ) : @xmath116 turning on a small @xmath10 will mix in a small fraction of spins of the opposite orientation , but the degeneracy will survive as the two states are related to each other by the global @xmath58 symmetry noted above ( [ ising1a ] ) .",
    "a thermodynamic system will always choose one or the other of the states as its ground states ( which may be preferred by some infinitesimal external perturbation ) , and hence the @xmath58 symmetry will be spontaneously broken .",
    "the correlations of the magnetization @xmath61 have an infinite range in either state as @xmath117 the quantity @xmath118 is the spontaneous magnetization , and equals @xmath119 in either of the two ground states .",
    "all of the statements made in this paragraph clearly hold for @xmath115 , and will hold for some @xmath120 provided the perturbation theory in @xmath10 has a non - zero radius of convergence .",
    "the exact solution of the model to be discussed later will verify that this is indeed the case .",
    "the excited states can be described in terms of an elementary domain wall ( or kink ) excitation .",
    "for instance the state @xmath121 has domain walls , or nearest neighbor pairs of antiparallel spins , between sites @xmath122 , @xmath123 and sites @xmath124 , @xmath125 . at @xmath115",
    "the energy of such a state is clearly @xmath126number of domain walls .",
    "the consequences of a small non - zero @xmath10 are now very similar to those due to @xmath77 corrections in the complementary large @xmath10 limit : the domain walls become `` particles '' which can hop and form momentum eigenstates with excitation energy @xmath127 the spectrum can be interpreted in terms @xmath82-particle scattering states , although it must be emphasized that the interpretation of the particle is now very different from that in the large @xmath10 limit . again",
    ", the perturbation theory in @xmath10 only mixes states which differ by even numbers of particles , although now the matrix element in ( [ ising2 ] ) is non - zero only for states @xmath86 with an _ even _ number of particles ; these assertions can easily be checked to hold in a perturbation theory in @xmath10 .",
    "so @xmath107 will now have a pole at @xmath128 , @xmath129 , from the term in ( [ ising2 ] ) where @xmath130 one of the ground states , indicating the presence of long - range order .",
    "further , there is now no single particle contribution , and the first finite @xmath131 spectral density is the continuum above the two particle threshold .",
    "the absence of a single particle delta function in this case is a very special feature of the @xmath4 , @xmath3 model , and is not expected to hold in higher @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath88 matrix for the collision of two domain walls can now be computed in a perturbation theory in @xmath10 , and as in the strong - coupling @xmath77 expansion , we find that there is no particle production , and @xmath132 to all orders in @xmath10 .",
    "the qualitative considerations of the previous section are quite useful in developing an intuitive physical picture .",
    "we will now take a different route , and set up a formalism that will eventually lead to an exact determination of many physical correlators ; these results will vindicate the approximate methods for @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and also provide an understanding of the novel physics at @xmath65 .",
    "the central idea is the application of the jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite .",
    "we map the @xmath133 , @xmath134 states on each site to the fock space of spinless fermions which can have occupation numbers @xmath135 on each site .",
    "the operator representation of the mapping is @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the annihilation operator for the fermion at site @xmath53 . inserting ( [ jw1 ] ) into @xmath57",
    "we find that the resulting hamiltonian is quadratic in the fermions @xmath138 this hamiltonian can be diagonalized in momentum space by a bogoliubov transformation .",
    "the fermionic quasiparticle operators are @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) and the diagonal form of @xmath57 is @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the single particle energy .",
    "as @xmath143 , the ground state , @xmath144 , of @xmath57 has has no @xmath145 fermions and therefore satisfies @xmath146 for all @xmath89 .",
    "the excited states are created by occupying the single particle states ; they can clearly be classified by the total number of occupied states , and a @xmath82-particle state has the from @xmath147 , with all the @xmath148 distinct .",
    "the above structure of the spectrum confirms the approximate considerations of section  [ sec : limiting ] .",
    "we have now found that the particles are in fact free fermions , and two fermions will not scatter even when they are close to each other ; alternatively they can be considered as hard - core bosons which have an @xmath88 matrix which does not allow particle production , and which equals @xmath149 at all momenta .",
    "we shall find it much more useful to take the latter point of view , as the bosonic particles have a simple , local , interpretation in terms of the underlying spin excitations : for @xmath63 the bosons are simply spins oriented in the @xmath134 direction , while for @xmath69 they are domain walls between the two ground states .",
    "the fermionic representation is useful for certain technical manipulation , but the bosonic point of view is much more useful for making physical arguments , as we shall see below .",
    "the excitation energy @xmath98 in ( [ ising5 ] ) is non - zero and positive for all @xmath89 provided @xmath150 .",
    "the energy gap , or the minimum excitation energy is always at @xmath151 , and equals @xmath152 .",
    "this gap vanishes at @xmath65 , and it is natural to expect that @xmath153 is the phase boundary between the two qualitatively different phases discussed in section  [ sec : limiting ] . precisely at @xmath65 , fermions with low momenta can carry arbitrarily low energy , and therefore must dominate the low temperature properties .",
    "these properties suggest that the state at @xmath65 is critical , and there is a cqft which describes the critical properties in its vicinity . as the important excitations are near @xmath151 , we define the continuum fermi field @xmath154 we express @xmath57 in terms of @xmath155 , and expand in spatial gradients .",
    "this gives the fermionic lagrangean of the cqft believed to be equivalent to @xmath40 for @xmath4 , @xmath3 : @xmath156 the field @xmath155 is now implicitly assumed to be a function of space and imaginary time ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the coupling constants in ( [ ising6 ] ) are given for @xmath57 by @xmath157 however , the relations ( [ ising6a ] ) are very specific to the solvable model @xmath57 . for more complicated , non - solvable , ising models which have a similar naive continuum limit ( _ e.g. _ models with second neighbor exchange ) , the values of @xmath16 and @xmath36 appearing in the continuum quantum field theory can not be determined exactly .",
    "indeed @xmath16 and @xmath36 are parameters which depend upon details of the microscopic hamiltonian , _",
    "i.e. _ they have a non - universal dependence upon a coupling constant like @xmath10 , as can be checked by a simple estimate of perturbative fluctuation corrections due to irrelevant operators .    comparing the dependence of @xmath16 on @xmath10 in ( [ ising6a ] ) with ( [ gg ] ) we conclude that the exponent @xmath158 .",
    "further at the critical point @xmath159 , the excitation energy @xmath160 , which fixes the dynamic critical exponent @xmath37 .",
    "the continuum theory @xmath161 can be diagonalized much like the lattice model @xmath57 , and the excitation energy now takes a `` relativistic '' form @xmath162 which shows that @xmath163 is the @xmath27 energy gap ( we will choose the sign of @xmath16 to be different on the two sides of the critical value of @xmath10 ) , and @xmath36 is the velocity of the excitations , both measurable quantities .",
    "the form of @xmath98 correctly suggests that @xmath161 is invariant under lorentz transformations .",
    "this can be made explicit by writing the complex grassman field @xmath155 in terms of two real grassman fields , when the action becomes what is known as the field theory of majorana fermions of mass @xmath164  @xcite ; we will not explicitly display this here .    while the continuum field @xmath155 has no direct physical interpretation , its correlators",

    "rather , in the next section , we will quote a recently obtained technical result , and then proceed to obtain dynamic correlators of @xmath61 by simple physical arguments .",
    "the purpose of this section is to describe the dynamics of the order parameter in the different regions of the @xmath171 phase diagram sketched in fig  [ fig3 ] ; this diagram follows from the considerations in section  [ intro ] , the expression for @xmath16 in ( [ ising6a ] ) , and computations to be described below .",

    "it is also interesting to consider the implication of fig  [ fig14 ] for @xmath499 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig  [ fig15 ] which plots the form of @xmath500 in @xmath8 : its value at @xmath501 is given by @xmath478 , while for all @xmath502 it equals @xmath480 .",
    "note the difference from fermi liquid theory , where the drude peak becomes a delta function with non - zero weight as @xmath206 .",
    "in the present case , the weight in the drude - like peak vanishes like @xmath503 as @xmath206 , and reduces to the _ single _ point @xmath316 where the conductivity is given by @xmath504 .",
    "we note that the above discussion implies results that are rather remarkable from a traditional quantum transport point of view .",
    "there have been a number of previous situations in which charge transport properties have been found to be universally related to the quantum unit of conductance , @xmath505 ; these include the quantized landauer conductance of ballistic transport in one - dimensional wires , and the universal conductance fluctuations of mesoscopic metals  @xcite .",
    "however in all previous cases , these universal properties have arisen in a `` phase - coherent '' regime , _",
    "i.e. _ they are associated with physics at scales shorter than the mean distance between inelastic scattering events between the carriers . for the case of a @xmath8 quantum critical point",
    "discussed above , the universal number @xmath480 is associated with quantum coherent transport , and is therefore the analog of these earlier results . in contrast , the value of @xmath478 is controlled by repeated inelastic scattering events , and therefore the d.c .",
    "transport is clearly in what would traditionally be identified as the `` incoherent '' regime .",
    "nevertheless , we have argued above that @xmath506 is a universal number , and the d.c .",
    "conductance remains universally related to @xmath507 .",
    "let us now turn to the computation of @xmath477 for the specific model @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath171 transport properties of @xmath40 in @xmath8 were considered briefly by cha _",
    "et al . _",
    "they concluded that the continuum model @xmath40 had @xmath508 for all @xmath171 , and that additional lattice umklapp scattering effects were needed to degrade the current carried by thermally excited carriers , and to yield a @xmath509 .",
    "however , in section  [ sec : diffusion ] we a found finite diffusivity @xmath427 for @xmath5 , @xmath4 at @xmath171 , and we claim that a similar result holds here for @xmath7 , @xmath8 .",
    "the basic point can be made quite simply by a glance at fig  [ fig11 ] .",
    "note that in this @xmath4 model , the transport of _ momentum _ is indeed ballistic , and is represented by the straight line trajectories which extend for all time .",
    "however , when we consider the transport of _ charge _",
    ", we have to follow the motion of the @xmath1-valued @xmath0 index carried by each trajectory : this motion is seen in fig  [ fig11 ] to be rather complicated , and was shown in section  [ sec : diffusion ] to be diffusive .",
    "there is thus an essential difference between momentum and charge transport when the excitations carry a @xmath0 flavor index , and it appears to have been overlooked in ref  @xcite .",
    "we will outline the recent computation of @xmath477 in an expansion in @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "for small @xmath510 the quartic interaction , @xmath39 , in @xmath40 reaches a universal ( to leading order in @xmath510 ) fixed point value  @xcite @xmath511 in the vicinity of the quantum critical point .",
    "so the scattering of the elementary excitations , and the non - ballistic motion of the charge current , only occurs with an amplitude of order @xmath510 .",
    "such a weak - coupling @xmath88-matrix should be compared with the complementary strong - coupling @xmath88-matrix in ( [ smatrix ] ) for @xmath4 : in the latter case we had a maximal scattering situation as momentum and spin labels interchanged their mutual pairing in every collision .",
    "also in contrast to the real - space formulation of transport taken for @xmath4 in section  [ sec : diffusion ] , the weak - coupling situation here is best analyzed in momentum space .",
    "we wish to work with same charge eigenstates we considered in section  [ sec : diffusion ] , and so we express the field @xmath155 in the associated normal modes @xmath512 where @xmath513 , with @xmath358 a renormalized @xmath15-dependent mass  @xcite .",
    "the operators @xmath514 annihilate particles with @xmath515 charges @xmath516 ( in section  [ sec : diffusion ] , where we considered @xmath327 , there were three such particles ) .",
    "next , transport theory requires the momentum space distribution functions @xmath517 with @xmath518 , in terms of which a quantum boltzmann equation for transport in a weakly - scattering system can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "we will not display the explicit form of this equation , or discuss its solution here : the reader should consult ref  @xcite .",
    "that analysis leads to an explicit solution for @xmath477 which has the qualitative form of fig  [ fig14 ] .",
    "we quote quantitative results for the two limiting values  @xcite : @xmath519 to leading order in @xmath510 .",
    "notice the singular @xmath510 dependence of the first result : this is signal of a `` boundary layer '' in @xmath477 of width @xmath520 which constitutes the `` drude peak '' of fig  [ fig14 ] .",
    "this boundary layer explicitly demonstrates a claim made in section  [ intro ] : the operations of expansion in @xmath510 and of analytic continuation in @xmath131 do not commute .",
    "the structure of the higher - order corrections to the first result in ( [ i1 ] ) is quite complex , and was generally discussed in ref  @xcite . for the superfluid insulator transition in @xmath8 with @xmath521 , ( [ i1 ] ) implies a universal d.c .",
    "conductivity @xmath522 this result is remarkably close to the value , @xmath523 ( argued  @xcite to be related to self - duality ) , and to the results of many experiments  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it was conjectured in ref  @xcite that @xmath524 exactly for @xmath7 in @xmath8 .",
    "definitively establishing this self - duality however requires techniques other than expansion in @xmath47 , or @xmath48 , as it is only possible precisely at @xmath8 , @xmath7 .",
    "finding such techniques is an important challenge for future work .",
    "we have reviewed the universal , non - zero temperature dynamic properties of the cqft @xmath40 for a number of representative cases , and discussed their experimental implications . among the cases omitted ,",
    "there are some that show phenomena qualitatively different from those discussed here : ( _ i _ ) the case @xmath7 , @xmath4 has a line of critical points and a kosterlitz - thouless end point at @xmath27 .",
    "its paramagnetic phase is similar to the @xmath5 , @xmath4 model discussed in section  [ sec : diffusion ] .",
    "( _ ii _ ) for @xmath525 there is violation of hyperscaling , which leads to explicit dependence of finite @xmath15 behavior on the bare value of @xmath39 and qualitatively different crossovers  @xcite .",
