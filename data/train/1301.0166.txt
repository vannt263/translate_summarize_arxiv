    "computer simulations of macromolecular liquids described at the atomistic level are extremely useful because they bridge information between the microscopic molecular structure of the polymeric system , at the given thermodynamic conditions , and its macroscopic properties , such as viscosity , diffusion , and dynamical - mechanical response , which are observed experimentally.@xcite it is unfortunate that , despite the progress already occurred in the computational hardware and software , the study of the dynamics of polymeric liquids by atomistic computer simulations is still limited by the impossibility of simulating polymer dynamics in the wide range of time and length scales relevant for these systems .",
    "it is known that long simulation trajectories deteriorate with time , following a law defined by the lyapunov exponent characteristic of the system , and the resulting long - time dynamics is affected by errors.@xcite    atomistic simulations of polymeric liquids are limited either in the length and number of macromolecules , or in the maximum timescale that can be reached .",
    "the long timescale is a regime of great interest for these systems , because of the relevance of dynamical - mechanical properties of macromolecules in that regime for their industrial applications . because the limitation concerns only the region of long - time , large - scale properties , it is possible to shift the focus of a simulation to this region of interest by the reduction of the simulated degrees of freedom through the averaging of local scale properties , i.e. adopting a so - called  coarse - graining \" procedure .",
    "while simulations of coarse - grained systems afford to represent larger length- and longer time - scales than atomistic simulations , they also are marred by the shortcoming that the measured dynamics is unphysically fast .",
    "this is the advantage that allows one to perform simulations in the long - time regime , but it is also a problem because the dynamics in the simulation becomes too fast and measured diffusion coefficients are too large .",
    "depending on the level of coarse - graining the dynamics can become orders of magnitude faster than the atomistic dynamics.@xcite    being aware that the dynamics has to be rescaled to recover the correct timescale,@xcite one resorts to the most conventional method , which is to build a calibration curve calculated by superimposing the long - time dynamics of the coarse - grained and atomistic simulations.@xcite the hope is for this calibration curve to be transferable to other systems , or to be identical , and so applicable , for thermodynamic conditions close to , but different than the phase point for which the curve was optimized in the first place . otherwise , if an atomistic simulation has to be ran every time we need to rescale a coarse - grained simulation there is no advantage in running simulations of coarse - grained ( cg ) systems .",
    "the rescaling factor of the conventional calibration curve is , however , purely a numerical correction .",
    "there is no physical motivation for one to assume that this correction has to be identical for any system or thermodynamic condition different from the ones in which it was optimized .",
    "given that the effective potentials between coarse - grained units are free energies , and as such they are parameter dependent , it is very unlikely that numerically optimized corrections will be identical for different systems .",
    "however , if the calibration curve is applied for conditions of temperature , density , and degree of polymerization , very close in the phase diagram to the ones in which the calibration curve was originally optimized , there is hope that the error is very contained .",
    "alternatively , in the case that very limited levels of coarse - graining are applied , e.g. combination of a few atoms to obtain a new coarse - grained unit , the error incurred in using the calibration curve in different conditions , can be small enough to be within the numerical error of the calculation .",
    "this is in fact the reason for the observed good agreement in the rescaled dynamics of systems with contained level of coarse - graining.@xcite    the goal of this paper is orthogonal to the more conventional calculation of an optimized calibration curve for systems with limited level of coarse - graining .",
    "in fact our goal is to investigate the physical motivation that leads to the accelerated dynamics in first place and to provide , through our analysis , a theoretical approach to calculate , from first principle equations , the correction factor that needs to be applied to the fast dynamics measured in coarse - grained simulations to recover the slower and more realistic dynamics of the atomistic description .",
    "we study the most extreme level of molecular coarse - graining , where one polymer chain is represented as a soft sphere , because i ) the description is analytical allowing the formal study of the rescaling problem , ii ) it provides a solid test of the reconstruction procedure because possible errors would be maximized , iii ) this level of coarse - graining is associated with the largest computational gain , so it is important .",
    "recently we have proposed an original procedure to rescale the dynamics measured in simulations of coarse - grained polymer melts.@xcite the procedure we proposed does not require to run atomistic simulations to calibrate the dynamics of the coarse - grained simulation . once one parameter , specifically the diameter of the hard - core monomer potential , is fixed , the rescaling factors are fully determined .",
    "the advantage of this method is clear , given that the coarse - grained simulation can reach larger - scale longer - time properties than the atomistic simulation .",
    "because no atomistic simulations are needed , the measured dynamics can be directly rescaled to obtain the dynamics of the real system we wanted to study .",
    "the method has been formally derived , and then applied to systems of polyethylene ( pe ) melts . the choice of pe as a test system was motivated by the wealth of experimental and simulation data available in the literature .",
    "we have shown that the proposed theory is able to predict diffusion coefficients in agreement with both atomistic simulations and experiments for systems in both the unentangled and entangled regimes , for a range of temperatures and densities .",
    "for entangled system the approach of dynamical reconstruction includes an extra loop in the calculation of the friction coefficient , which accounts for the fact that in real systems described at the atomistic level , the dynamics is slowed down by the presence of entanglements .",
    "we hypothesized for the entanglements to relax in time following the same dynamical mechanism of single chain interdiffusion . in this paper entangled chain dynamics is not investigated as most of the samples in the atomistic simulations are either unentangled or in the region of crossover from the unentangled to the entangled regimes .",
    "one of the questions that still needed to be answered was if our method was able to generate high quality predictions also for macromolecular liquids with a more complex monomeric structure than the simple polyethylene .",
    "a first study of this issue is presented in this manuscript which investigates the agreement between theoretically predicted diffusion coefficients for _ cis_-1,4-polybutadiene ( pb ) chains and data from molecular dynamics simulations performed by tsolou , mavrantzas and coworkers.@xcite the approach is completely general and can be applied to polybutadiene chains with different tacticity . for these systems",
    "the difference in local chain semiflexibility , which corresponds to different overall chain dimension , i.e. a different radius - of - gyration ( @xmath0 ) and statistical segment length ( @xmath1 ) , ultimately leads to a different diffusion coefficients for polybutadienes with different tacticity .",
    "in this paper we limit our calculations to _ cis_-1,4-polybutadiene samples because those are the samples investigated by atomistic simulations and provide a effective test of our procedure for dynamical reconstruction .",
    "our rescaling method considers two contributions emerging from the consequence of applying the coarse - graining process and derives the theoretical corrections that need to be applied to the dynamics of the coarse - grained description to recover the modalities of the original atomistic system . to calculate the analytical correction we adopt for the atomistic descriptions a simple bead - and - spring description of the chain where each pb polymer of @xmath2 monomeric units is represented as a collection of @xmath2 beads connected by semi flexible springs of length @xmath3 , and the overall chain dimension is defined by the radius - of - gyration of the molecule , @xmath0 .",
    "this model is a rouse approach modified to include chain semiflexibility and has been shown to represent well the diffusion of polymer melts in the unentangled regime.@xcite from the comparison of this model and the soft sphere representation of the chain , it is possible to evaluate the two contributions that are responsible for the accelerated dynamics , and which have to be included to correct the measured dynamics and bring it to the realistic values of the atomistic ( here bead - and - spring ) description .",
    "the first correction emerges from the consideration that due to the process of averaging the intramolecular degrees of freedom , the coarse - grained system experiences a change in its entropy , because a number of local states are neglected . while the atomistic system devotes time to explore local configurations , the coarse - grained system does nt . to recover the correct dynamics those states need to be included _ a posteriori _ in the form of an entropic contribution to the free energy that rescales the time measured in the cg simulations .",
    "the second correction comes from the change of the  shape \" of the molecule once it is coarse - grained .",
    "macromolecules described at the atomistic level become represented by chains of effective atoms , or as bead - and - springs , chains of soft blobs , or even each molecule as a soft sphere . in all these multiple forms",
    "the surface of each molecule available to the surrounding molecules , i.e. the  solvent \" , is different .",
    "the hydrodynamic radius , @xmath4 , of the coarse - grained unit in each description is different and so is its friction coefficient , @xmath5 , defined by stokes law as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the viscosity of the medium . by solving the memory function for the friction coefficient in each description we are able to calculate the correction factor that has to be applied to each friction coefficient to recover the description at a different level of coarse - graining .    in this paper",
    "our rescaling method is first briefly summarized and then applied to study the dynamics of cis-1,4-pb and compared with simulation data by tsolou et.al.@xcite who also investigated the effect of temperature and pressure on the simulations.@xcite the global dynamics of the polymer is represented by the diffusion coefficient and the decay of the self - correlation for the end - to - end molecular vector .",
    "these dynamical quantities are reconstructed using the method by lyubimov at al.,@xcite from the information contained in the trajectories of the mesocale simulations of the coarse - grained polymer melts and show good agreement with the data from united atom simulations .",
    "for the internal dynamics the theory for cooperative motion@xcite is used to predict monomer dynamics and the dynamical structure factors , which compare well with the simulations . if atomistic simulations are not available , the theory of dynamical reconstruction is able to predict the correct dynamics from the rescaling of the mesoscale simulations having as an input the polymer radius - of - gyration , which can be calculated from simple structural models for polymers .",
    "the accuracy of adopting a freely rotating chain model for the calculation of the polymer radius of gyration is discussed in the last section .",
    "a brief summary concludes the paper .",
    "in this section we briefly present an overview of the main steps in our procedure .",
    "a complete and detailed presentation of the same has been already published@xcite and will not be repeated here .",
    "we start from the consideration that the procedure of coarse - graining corresponds to eliminating some internal degrees of freedom , by combining groups of atoms into one effective cg unit .",
    "specifically , our rescaling theory has been developed for an extended level of coarse - graining where intramolecular coordinates are fully averaged out and the polymer is represented as an isotropic sphere centered on the center - of - mass ( com ) of the macromolecule .",
    "there are some advantages in the choice of this description .",
    "first , the cg representation is fully isotropic , and even if it is known that the shape of a polymer is closer to an ellipsoid than to a sphere,@xcite the total correlation function of the polymeric liquid , i.e. the structure of the polymeric liquid , statistically averaged over all the possible configurations is well reproduced by this model ; second the formalism is analytical , which allows us to derive formally many of the physical quantities of interest for both the static and the dynamic properties of the coarse - grained system as a function of the atomistic description ; third all the consequences of the coarse - graining procedure are enhanced with this extreme level of coarse - graining and are easier to study in such a description . if the procedure adopted were not precise , the error would be maximized because of the high level of coarse - gaining ; the fact that the theory , which is predictive , is found to be in quantitative agreement with both simulated and experimental data is encouraging.@xcite    one disadvantage of having such a coarse - grained representation of the molecule is that no information is collected from the mesoscale simulation on the internal dynamics of the polymer . in this way",
    ", the soft sphere representation only provides information on the diffusion coefficient of the molecule .",
    "however , we show in this paper that from the knowledge of the diffusion coefficient and the related monomer friction coefficient for unentangled chains it is possible to recover correctly the internal dynamics of the chain by applying our theory for the cooperative dynamics of a group of interacting chains , which calculates the single chain dynamics for a macromolecule whose dynamics is coupled by the presence of intermolecular forces with the other interpenetrating macromolecules in the liquid .    in every cg model , the averaging of the intramolecular degrees of freedom leads to a speeding up of the dynamics . when a polymer is represented as a soft sphere the dynamics in the mesoscopic simulation is orders of magnitude faster than in the atomistic description .",
    "one of the reasons for this acceleration is the fact that while a macromolecule needs to explore a large number of internal chain configurations for each position of the center - of - mass , the soft sphere instead is free to move in the three - dimensional space undergoing brownian motion.@xcite to take into account the missing contribution of the time necessary to explore the internal degrees of freedom , the time measured in the mesoscale simulation of the soft sphere is multiplied by a rescaling factor that is calculated as the ratio of the energy due to the internal degrees of freedom in the two representations , i.e an atomistic and a soft sphere representations . for the atomistic representation we adopt an analytical bead - and - spring model , as previously described.@xcite",
    "this model has been shown to provide a quantitative description of the dynamics for polymeric liquids and for proteins in theta solvent.@xcite    the first correction term is calculated from the definition of the internal energy for a simple bead - and - spring model and for the soft sphere cg model .",
    "the mesoscale ( ms ) molecular dynamic ( md ) simulations are performed using a potential expressed in dimensionless units , which is a common procedure .",
    "the time from the simulations has to be properly normalized so that the dimensionless simulation time from ms simulations , @xmath8 , once dimensionalized and rescaled reads as    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the molecular mass of one chain and @xmath0 is the radius - of - gyration of the molecule , which is an input quantity in our approach .",
    "the internal degree - of - freedom averaged out in the coarse - grained description are accounted for by introducing the @xmath11 factor where @xmath2 is the number of beads .",
    "the second rescaling is due to the change in the shape of the molecule represented in the two levels of coarse - graining , and so the effective friction in the two representations . in the long time",
    "the com mean - square displacement is related to the molecular diffusion coefficient as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the diffusion coefficient of the system , which has to be calculated .",
    "if we use as a starting point the diffusion coefficient measured in the mesoscale simulation @xmath14 , the mean square displacement in the rescaled formalism is give by    @xmath15    where the problem reduces to the calculation of the friction coefficient in the monomer and soft - sphere representations .",
    "the friction coefficients are calculated from the solution of the memory function in the two representations ( bead - and - spring and soft - sphere ) .",
    "the formalism presented so far , adopts a rouse - like description of the single chain diffusion for the atomistic level representation of the system . at the coarse - grained level",
    "the chain is represented as a soft - sphere .",
    "eq.[eq : rescaling ] shows how the diffusion coefficient measured in a mesoscale simulation of a liquid of soft - spheres , @xmath16 , needs to be rescaled to give the mean - square displacement of the real chain , @xmath17 , as a function of the rescaled time , @xmath18 .",
    "the contributions that are still unknown are the friction coefficients in the atomistic and coarse - grained descriptions , which can be solved analytically starting from the definition of the memory function.@xcite    for a bead - and - spring model the monomer ( bead ) friction is given by :    @xmath19    where the memory function is defined as@xcite    @xmath20    where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the monomer density and @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the unit vectors characterizing the direction of the forces acting on monomers @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
