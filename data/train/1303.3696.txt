    "if we take a look of an image of a galaxy such as ngc 1300 , a special feature that immediately catches our attention is the prominence of the bar . at the same time",
    ", we can find galaxies of similar mass and overall morphology with no sign of bar presence .",
    "the presence of such prominent non - axisymmetric features must certainly shape the structure and secular evolution of the host galaxies by exerting tidal torques which lead to a redistribution of the galactic constituents ( friedli & benz 1993 ) .    through analytical and numerical calculations previous studies",
    "have shown that bars produce a redistribution of mass and angular momentum in the galactic disk ( hohl 1971 ; weinberg 1985 ; debattista & sellwood 2000 ; athanassoula 2002 ; martinez - valpuesta et al .",
    "2006 ; hwang et al . 2013 ) .",
    "stellar density waves can be driven by galactic bars leading to the formation of spiral arms ( lindblad 1960 ; toomre 1960 ; elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 ) and ring structures ( schwartz 1981 ; buta & combes 1996 ) .",
    "bars can also funnel material toward the galaxy center ; this is specially the case for the collisional gas component that can dissipate energy during shocks and flow inwards ( shlosman , frank & begelman 1989 ; friedli & benz 1993 ) .",
    "this inflow will produce an accumulation of material in the central region that can help in the build - up of disk - like bulges or pseudo - bulges ( sheth et al .",
    "2005 ; laurikainen et al . 2007 ; okamoto 2012 ) , most prominently in the case of early - type galaxies where bars appear larger ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 , 1989 ; erwin 2005 ) . as a result of these gas inflows ,",
    "higher molecular gas concentrations are found in the central regions of barred galaxies ( sakamoto et al .",
    "1999 ; sheth et al .",
    "2005 ) , as well as younger populations in the bulges of barred galaxies when compared with unbarred ones ( coelho & gadotti 2011 ) .",
    "numerical simulations by friedli , benz & kennicutt ( 1994 ) show not only inflow , but also outflow induced by the bar , that can facilitate chemical mixing and trigger star formation as found in observational studies ( hummel et al .",
    "1990 ; huang et al . 1996",
    "; ellison et al . 2011 ) .",
    "if bars funnel gas inwards and most of massive galaxies host super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) , a natural consequence would be an enhanced active galactic nucleus ( agn ) activity .",
    "mechanisms such as `` bars within bars '' ( shlosman et al . 1989 , 2000 ) and nuclear spirals ( martini & pogge 1999 ; mrquez et al .",
    "2000 ) have been suggested to transport gas to the vicinity of the smbh , but in this respect no consensus has been reached , with some authors proposing the presence of bars as a triggering factor for agn activity ( knapen et al .",
    "2000 ; laine et al . 2002 ; laurikainen et al .",
    "2004 ) , while others are more sceptical ( moles et al . 1995 ; mulchaey & regan 1997 ; lee et al .",
    "2012b ; oh et al .",
    "2012 ) .    some numerical simulations ( hasan & norman 1990 ; norman , sellwood & hasan 1996 ; athanassoula et al . 2005 ) show weakening of the bars , and in some cases dissolution , by a central mass concentration ( cmc ) or gravity torques ( bournaud et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in order to explain the large proportion of barred galaxies observed in different observational surveys , mechanisms such as the dissolution and reformation of bars as recurrent transient structures has been proposed ( e.g. combes 2000 ; bournaud & combes 2002 ) , as well as the survival of bars to the presence of a cmc ( shen & sellwood 2004 ; debattista et al .",
    "2006 )    recently , the relevance of bars in galaxy evolution has motivated a large number of studies .",
    "the fraction of barred galaxies found in optical images varies depending on the method used to identify galaxies with bars and on sample selection , with the typical fraction between 30% up to 50% ( barazza et al . 2008 ; aguerri et al .",
    "2009 ; nair & abraham 2010 ; lee et al .",
    "2012a , henceforth lee+12 ) .",
    "the fraction appears even higher when near - infrared images are used , where weak bars are not obscured by dust and hence are more easily identified ( marinova & jogee 2007 ; menndez - delmestre et al .",
    "2007 ) , appearing at nir wavelengths as strong bars ( buta et al . 2010 ) .",
    "analyses of the bar fraction in the hubble deep fields found a dramatic drop of barred systems at @xmath1 ( abraham et al .",
    "1999 ; van den bergh et al .",
    "2002 ) later confirmed by sheth et al .",
    "( 2008 ) studying a sample of luminous face - on spirals from the 2 deg@xmath2 cosmic evolution survey , although results from others studies report the contrary , a constant bar fraction since @xmath3 ( e. g. elmegreen et al . 2004 ; jogee et al .",
    "sheth et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also find that the bar fraction in spiral galaxies is a strong function of stellar mass , color and bulge prominence such as it increases for more massive , luminous redder systems with a slight preference for bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "using a smaller sample of 190 galaxies from the coma cluster , mndez - abreu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that bars are hosted by galaxies in a tight range of luminosities ( -20 @xmath4 -17 ) and masses ( 10@xmath5 10@xmath6 ) .",
    "nair & abraham ( 2010 ) also report this strong dependence on mass , but given that their sample contain low mass galaxies , they are able to assess that the bar fraction is bimodal on mass , with a high fraction at the low mass end , mostly on late - type spirals , a decrease of the fraction at intermediate mass galaxies ( log@xmath7 ) , and increasing again at the high mass end , this time most of the barred galaxies being early - type spirals .",
    "recently lee+12 found that the bar fraction strongly depends on color , with the fraction increasing significantly as the color becomes redder for the case of long bars , while the opposite is found for galaxies hosting short bars ( see also nair & abraham 2010 ; masters et al .",
    "regarding the dimensions of bars , erwin ( 2005 ) found that early - type disk galaxies host bars a factor of @xmath82.5 longer than late - type disks , and gadotti ( 2011 ) shows that longer bars tend to be hosted by galaxies with prominent bulges .",
    "in general , bars are found to be larger and stronger in early - type galaxies ( elmegreen & elmegreen 1985 , 1989 ; aguerri et al .",
    "2009 ; hoyle et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "all these evidence leads to conclude that bars play a major role in the secular evolution of galaxies ( e. g. kormendy & kennicutt 2004 ; laurikainen et al .",
    "2007 ) and can be sensitive to dynamical interactions of the host galaxy with its neighbors ( lee+12 ) . on previous works , some of us have investigated the role of the galactic spin on shaping the structure and morphology of present day galaxies .",
    "features such as galaxy color , the thickness of the disk , bulge prominence , metallicity and agn activity are strongly dependent on the spin of the systems ( e. g. hernandez & cervantes - sodi 2006 ; cervantes - sodi & hernandez 2009 ; cervantes - sodi et al .",
    "numerical studies ( efstathiou , lake & negroponte 1982 , henceforth eln ; mayer & wadsley 2004 ; governato et al .",
    "2009 ; foyle , courteau & thacker 2008 ) have shown that haloes with lower spin parameter , more compact and self - gravitating , are more prone to global instabilities and the formation of bars .",
    "syer , mao & mo ( 1999 ) tried to prove this hypothesis using a sample of @xmath8 2,500 galaxies selected randomly from the the eso - uppsala catalogue ( lauberts 1982 ) , but could not find any trend pointing to barred galaxies having systematically lower spin .",
    "it must be taken into account that some systematics could be affecting the result , such that the majority are relatively late types ( mainly sb - sd types ) .",
    "later on , athanassoula ( 2008 ) pointed out that the enl stability criterion was over - simplistic and could not distinguish bar stable from bar unstable disks , specially because it does not take into account the disk velocity dispersion . on a previous study ,",
    "athanassoula & sellwood ( 1986 ) showed that velocity dispersion has an important influence on bar stability . in their studies they presented a disk with no halo , which was stable because of its high - velocity dispersion .    in the present study",
    "we want to address this topic , we will investigate further if the spin parameter has any direct intervention on the presence of bars in disk galaxies .",
    "the format of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the model to infer the spin parameter for disk galaxies in our sample .",
    "the sample is described in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we present our general results of the dependence of the bar fraction on the galactic spin .",
    "discussion regarding our results is presented in section 5 , followed by our conclusions in section 6 .",
    "to account for the spin of disk galaxies we use the @xmath9 spin parameter as defined by peebles ( 1971 ) ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the total energy , mass and angular momentum of the configuration , respectively . in order to estimate this parameter for the galaxies in our sample ,",
    "we adopt the model by mo , mao & white ( 1998 ) as we did in hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 ) . here",
    "we briefly recall the main ingredients of the model . in the framework of the cdm scenario for galaxy formation ,",
    "primordial density fluctuations give rise to haloes of dark matter of mass @xmath12 , within which gas condenses and forms rotationally supported disks of maximum circular velocity @xmath14 .",
    "the disk is expected to be thin and presenting an exponential surface density profile    @xmath15    with @xmath16 the central surface density , @xmath17 the disk scalelength , and corresponding mass    @xmath18    which is a fraction @xmath19 of the halo mass    @xmath20    if we describe the dark matter halo by a truncated singular isothermal sphere of radius @xmath21 , @xmath22 , with    @xmath23    as defined by bullock et al .",
    "the dark matter halo is responsible for establishing a rigorously flat rotation curve along the disk , from where the angular momentum of the disk is    @xmath24    assuming that the specific angular momentum of the disk is a fraction @xmath25 of that of the halo , we can express equation ( [ bullock ] ) as :    @xmath26    we define @xmath0 as the product @xmath27 . in the case of both components ; baryons and dark matter , having the same specific angular momentum , @xmath0 becomes @xmath9 and we recover the expression we have used to assess the spin of disk galaxies in previous works i.e. hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 ) and cervantes - sodi et al .",
    "the input parameters in equation ( [ generallambda ] ) to estimate the spin of disk galaxies are the disk scalelenght @xmath17 , the disk mass @xmath28 , the circular velocity @xmath14 and the disk mass fraction @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath17 is taken from the sdss @xmath29-band . as an estimation for the disk mass we use the stellar mass obtained from the mpa / jhu dr7 vagc , which are based on fits to the sdss five - band with the model of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ,",
    "see also kauffmann et al .",
    "given that the location of a galaxy in the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation does not depend on barredness ( courteau et al .",
    "2003 ; sheth et al .",
    "2012 ) , we determine confidently @xmath14 by the @xmath30-band tully - fisher relation from pizagno et al .",
    "( 2007 ) for all the late - type galaxies of the sample . finally , following gnedin et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , we derive the disk mass fraction in terms of the stellar surface density using :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is chosen using the milky way as a representative example . in cervantes - sodi",
    "( 2008 ) we proved the accuracy in our estimation of @xmath9 by comparing the estimation using equation [ generallambda ] to values arising from numerical simulations of different authors .",
    "the result was a one - to - one correlation with small dispersion and no bias , leading to typical errors of less than @xmath34 .",
    "it has also been used by other groups finding it appropriate for different kind of studies ( e.g. puech et al .",
    "2007 ; gogarten et al . 2010 ; muoz - mateos et al . 2011 ) .",
    "one would expect that galaxies with low spin parameters , being more compact and self - gravitating , be more prone to global instabilities .",
    "a simple criterion for the instability of a thin exponential stellar disk was proposed by eln using a set of n - body experiments ; namely , bar instability occurs if    @xmath35    which is a measure of the self - gravity of the disk .",
    "this value is to be compared to a self - gravitation exponential disk , with a value @xmath36 . by combining equations ( [ generallambda ] ) and ( [ eln ] )",
    ", we get that    @xmath37    in this context we expect to find an increase of the fraction of barred galaxies as we move from high to low spinning galaxies .",
    "the sample of galaxies analysed in this work comes from a previous study by lee+12 .",
    "it is a volume limited sample of galaxies extracted from the sdss dr7 ( abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) with absolute magnitude in the @xmath30-band brighter than @xmath38 within the redshift range @xmath39 .",
    "a total of 33,391 galaxies are identified from the korea institute for advanced study value - added galaxy catalogue ( choi et al .",
    "given that we will focus our analysis on late - type galaxies , we divide this main sample into early- and late - type galaxies using the prescription by park & choi ( 2005 ) , where galaxies are segregated according to their morphology in the color versus color gradient and concentration index space .",
    "an additional visual inspection was performed to improve the accuracy of the morphology classification .",
    "galaxies are classified by visual inspection of @xmath40 combined color images into long - barred , short - barred and non - barred systems .",
    "a galaxy having a bar that is larger than one quarter of the size of its host galaxy is classified as long - barred , while the opposite case is a short bar .",
    "the visual classification is more robust for face - on galaxies , where we also avoid internal extinction effects that would provide an underestimation of @xmath14 when using our tf relation . to this effect",
    "we limit our sample to galaxies with the minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath41 .",
    "our final sample contains 10,674 late - type galaxies , 3,240 with long bars and 698 with short bars .",
    "as described in lee++12 , the classification shows a good agreement with the classification performed by nair & abraham ( 2010 ) considering the galaxies in common in the two samples , with our sample showing only a relatively small fraction of galaxies with short bars when compared with theirs due to a slightly stricter criterion .",
    "figure 3 of lee++12 also shows some examples of late - type galaxy images with long and short bars .    for a more detailed description of the sample , and comparisons of the classification with previous works ,",
    "we refer the reader to lee+12 .",
    "[ cols=\"^ \" , ]     the corresponding two dimensional maps for the bar fraction in the log(@xmath42 ) vs. log(@xmath0 ) space are shown in figure [ sigmamaps ] . in agreement with what we expected",
    ", we can first notice the anti - correlation between the two physical parameters , and for the case of long bars , a clear decrease of the bar fraction , even for low spinning systems , with @xmath43 160 km s@xmath44 .",
    "although this can not be regarded as a prove for our hypothesis , given that our @xmath0 estimation comes from invoking a tf relation , and not from a pure kinematic study , this result can be explained as a result of two competing factors , the self - gravity of the disk that enhances the formation of bars , and the support by random motions that works in the opposite direction , preventing bar instabilities .",
    "galaxies hosting a short bar have typically higher spin than those hosting long bars or non - barred galaxies , with the bar fraction increasing with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the presence of these short bars on high @xmath0 systems confront the eln stability criterion as shown in figure  [ stabdistribution]b , where the bar fraction increases even for galaxies with @xmath45 . as pointed out by sellwood & moore ( 1999 ) ,",
    "while the normal bar instability gives a natural explanation for the presence of strong bars , there is no alternative mechanism to explain the existence of weak bars .",
    "erwin ( 2005 ) presents a careful and extensive comparison of bar lengths between observational and numerical results and concludes that the simulations compared with his results tend to produce long bars , and except two early simulations ( pfenniger & friedli 1991 ; combes & elmegreen 1993 ) , no n - body bars are as small as typical sc - sd bars , that are expected to be galaxies with a high spin parameter .",
    "an extreme case of high spinning systems is low surface brightness galaxies ( lsbs ) .",
    "simulations with @xmath46 are able to reproduce some of the physical characteristics of these galaxies such as their surface density profiles and colors ( e. g. jimenez et al . 1998 ; kim & lee 2012 ) , and while they are expected to be stable to bar formation due to the low self - gravity of their disks and be dark matter dominated at all radii , some simulations are able to produce bars that display a mild oval distortion ( mihos , mcgaugh & de block 1997 ) , with short - lived episodes that finally evolve to a bulge - like structure ( mayer & wadsley 2004 ) .    the fact that bars appear short on high spinning galaxies could be due to the low efficiency of their disks as angular momentum sinks .",
    "the disperse disks of these systems are unable to carry away the necessary amount of angular momentum from the bar in order to grow to the extent of the typical bars of low spinning galaxies .    recently , scannapieco & athanassoula ( 2012 ) studied the properties of bars formed in fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of milky way - mass galaxies and found that the longest bar is formed in a bulge - disk - halo system with the lowest spin parameter , and the shortest is found in a galaxy with a disk but not significant bulge and the highest spin parameter .",
    "previous studies have shown similar results ( athanassoula & misiriotis 2002 ; ahtanassoula 2003 ) , stronger bars residing in galaxies with prominent bulges .",
    "hernandez & cervantes - sodi ( 2006 ) noticed that galaxies with the largest bulge - to - disk ratio are those with low spin parameter , a result that fits in this picture of galaxies with low values of @xmath0 presenting longer bars that galaxies with high spin .",
    "the competing effects of self - gravity in development and growth of the bar instability and the suppression through random motions in dispersion dominated systems helps to explain the dependence of the bar fraction on the galactic spin .",
    "given the clear trend for mean @xmath0 values increasing in going towards later hubble types ( cervantes - sodi & hernandez 2009 and references therein ) , our results are in good agreement with previous studies regarding the bar fraction as a function of morphological type , in the sense that bars in early - type , low spinning galaxies , are longer than those in late - type , high spinning ones ( e.g. erwin 2005 ) .",
    "an additional factor that might be playing an important role is the content of cold gas .",
    "galaxies with high spin have typically late - type morphology , with blue colors and higher gas mass fractions . in these systems",
    "the eln stability criterion might not apply as pointed out by christodoulou et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , given the big influence the gas has in the formation and development of stellar bars .",
    "the threshold value found in simulations varies depending on the amount of gas and the type of cooling that is implemented ( mayer & wadsley 2004 ) , but in general the gas component severely limits the bar growth and evolution ( villa - vargas et al . 2010 ) , usually producing weak , short - lived bars . previously , shlosman & noguchi ( 1993 ) studied the effect of gas on the global stability of a galactic disk embedded in a live halo , and they found two different regimes ; in a low gas surface density disk , the radial redistribution of the gas depends solely on the stability of the stellar disk , while for high gas surface density , the gas develops inhomogeneities that heat up the stellar component that increases the stability of the system preventing the growth of a bar .",
    "this result fits well with our finding , where long bars are hosted by luminous , massive , red galaxies that typically present low gas content , while short bars are found in low luminosity , low mass , blue galaxies which are usually gas rich .    on a recent study by athanassoula et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , the authors follow the formation and evolution of bars in n - body simulations of disk galaxies with gas , where the gas component is modeled as a multiphase medium , including star formation , feedback and cooling .",
    "the study shows that in gas - rich simulations , the disk stays axisymmetric longer than in gas - poor ones , and once the bar forms , it grows at a much slower rate .",
    "this explains why fully grown bars are in place earlier in massive red disks than in blue spirals .",
    "in a subsequent study , we will investigate the combined effect of gas content and spin on the bar properties of disk galaxies .",
    "in summary , we report a strong dependence of the bar fraction on the galactic spin of disk galaxies .",
    "this dependence on @xmath0 is different for long and short bars .",
    "long bars are preferentially found in galaxies with low to intermediate @xmath0 that are more prone to develop bar instabilities due to their self - gravitation .",
    "these galaxies are typically massive , luminous , red , gas poor systems , when compared with galaxies hosting short bars . instead",
    ", short bars are mostly found in high spinning galaxies , that at the same time are typically low mass , faint galaxies , with blue colors and rich in cold gas .",
    "the rise and fall of the bar fraction for the case of long bars as a function of @xmath0 can be explained as the result of two competing factors , the self - gravity of the systems and the support by random motions . at high @xmath0 values ,",
    "the decline of the bar fraction is due to the lack of self - gravity , being the disk more sparse the global instabilities are suppressed or damped . at low @xmath0 values , the support of the system by random motions instead of ordinate rotation becomes predominant ; that also prevents the formation and growth of bars .",
    "our finding of short bars being hosted by high spinning galaxies is in good agreement with previous observational and theoretical studies , considering that these systems are preponderantly blue , gas rich galaxies ; where the sparsity of the disk material and the large fraction of gas play an important role on restricting the formation / growth of the bar .",
