    "in cold dense regions of the ism , molecules are found in both the gaseous and solid phases .",
    "most species including the most abundant one , h@xmath0 , are found only in the gas phase .",
    "some species are found to have appreciable abundances in the layers of ice mantles , which cover interstellar grains with possibly more than 100 monolayers of ice in cold dense sources .",
    "the most abundant species in the ice mantle is water , the fractional abundance of which with respect to h@xmath0 is about @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the next most abundant species are carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide , with abundances 10 - 50 percent that of water  @xcite .",
    "methane , methanol and ammonia possess smaller abundances in the range 1 - 10 percent of water  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there might also be small amounts of other stable molecules such as h@xmath0o@xmath0 , the upper limit of which has been investigated recently @xcite .",
    "some species in the ice mantle , such as carbon monoxide , are formed initially in the gas phase and then accrete onto dust grains while most species are formed from simpler species on the grain surfaces and possibly inside the grain mantles .",
    "for example , only a small abundance of methanol can be produced in the gas phase ; its dominant mode of production is hydrogenation of co on grain surfaces via reactions with atomic hydrogen , followed by non - thermal desorption @xcite .",
    "more complex organic molecules ( coms ) such as methyl formate are also believed to be formed on dust grain surfaces via radical - radical reactions during the early stages of a later warm - up phase and then released into the gas  @xcite .",
    "such coms have recently been detected in the gas - phase of cold dense clouds  @xcite ; the details of their formation in these regions are currently not fully understood , but involve both non - thermal desorption of simpler precursor species such as methanol from the grain surface and additional gas - phase reactions  @xcite .",
    "the treatment of surface chemical processes on small interstellar grains involves a number of difficulties . @xcite and @xcite modeled the surface chemistry in the same way as the approach for gas phase chemistry , via coupled chemical kinetic differential equations .",
    "the approach is relatively easy to implement and computationally efficient , thus it is still widely used in gas - grain astrochemical modeling , with the additional approximation that all species in all monolayers of the ice are treated in the same manner .",
    "however , this approach has at least three major problems .",
    "the first occurs when the average number of reactive species such as atomic hydrogen on grain surfaces is less than one , and significant errors may occur unless the discrete numbers of species and their fluctuations are treated in some manner  @xcite .",
    "a number of approaches have been suggested to solve this problem . in order of increasing computational complexity ,",
    "these include the modified rate treatment  @xcite , the moment equation approach  @xcite , the chemical master equation approach  @xcite , macroscopic monte carlo simulations  @xcite , and microscopic monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "although all of these approaches have been applied to simulate the grain mantle chemistry with either a full surface reaction network or at least more than 10 reactions on grain surfaces  @xcite , the computational cost becomes more expensive as the approach becomes more rigorous .",
    "the second problem was first considered by @xcite , who argued that only species on the top layer of a grain mantle will react with each other , so that the bulk layers underneath this layer should remain chemically inert as an ice mantle gradually forms .",
    "this approach , now referred to as a three - phase model ( top layer , bulk , gas ) was virtually ignored for some time after its initial suggestion .",
    "separating species in the bulk from those on the top layer allows abundant and somewhat reactive species such co or h@xmath0co or even some very reactive radicals to remain non - reactive in the ice bulk for a long period of time .",
    "despite the fact that the microscopic monte carlo method can account for the non - reactivity of bulk species due to its spatial resolution of species  @xcite , different simulation approaches with less computational cost , but which typically do not have the same degree of spatial resolution capability , have also been applied to the problem recently  @xcite .",
    "the third problem with the conventional rate - equation method is that the same species on the outermost layer may have different binding energies and diffusion barriers on grain surfaces because of surface roughness , chemisorption , or porosity  @xcite . when reactive species are very volatile , modeling binding sites on a surface as uniform indistinguishable sites can result in large errors because stronger binding sites can help some species to be stabilized on grains until higher temperatures are reached , thus significantly changing the chemical kinetics .",
    "the formation of h@xmath0 from two atoms is an example where stronger binding sites help to increase h@xmath0 formation at higher temperatures when all of the atomic hydrogen on grain surfaces would otherwise sublime back to the gas before combining to form h@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this problem has been solved by improvements in the conventional rate equation approach  @xcite or more rigorous microscopic monte carlo simulations  @xcite .",
    "it is clearly true that in order for more accurate astrochemical modeling of ice mantles , any chemical kinetics that occurs in the bulk should be different from that on the top layer , or top several layers of a rough surface .",
    "however , it is not as true to treat the bulk as completely inert for several reasons .",
    "first of all , volatile species may gradually diffuse out of the mantle and then sublime into the gas phase .",
    "this effect has been studied by a rate equation approach with the so - called modified three phase model  @xcite . in this model , species are able to swap positions with other species in the bulk so that they are mobile . secondly , recent calculations show that the probability of uv photons to be absorbed by one monolayer of water ice is about 0.7%  @xcite .",
    "thus , uv photons can easily penetrate through as much as 150 monolayers of species of water ice in grain mantles and photodissociate species within these monolayers .",
    "so species within the bulk are only partially shielded from uv radiation and those more deeply buried within the bulk are less likely to undergo photodissociation .",
    "moreover , the products of photodissociation on the surface and those within the bulk were found to behave very differently  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the photodissociated species within the bulk were found to diffuse and recombine within the bulk while a large fraction of those on the surface were found to directly sublime .",
    "recent photodissociation laboratory experiments also qualitatively verify that species photodissociated from bulk water ice can diffuse and then recombine  @xcite .",
    "motivated by our recent success in unifying a microscopic monte carlo simulation for grain chemistry with a macroscopic monte carlo simulation for the gas phase  @xcite , we modified our microscopic monte carlo method for surface chemical reactions in order to include reactions and diffusion within the bulk .",
    "moreover , for the first time , we included about 300 surface reactions in the surface reaction network , a large number which is feasible because of our improved simulation algorithm .",
    "photodissociation reactions are also included and the products of photodissociation are allowed to diffuse within the bulk ice mantle .",
    "another recent attempt has been made to include bulk diffusion in an interstellar model . in this attempt , a three - phase model of gas - grain chemistry",
    "was utilized with modified rate kinetics to study the formation of glycine and other coms during the formation of a hot core at 200 k  @xcite . here , photodissociation was assumed to occur at equal rates in all layers , while swapping was assumed to be the mechanism for bulk diffusion .",
    "swapping , however , may not be the major mechanism for bulk diffusion at low temperatures because of possibly large barriers against the process .",
    "not surprisingly , @xcite found that bulk diffusion is not important for the formation of the ice mantle in the early , low temperature , phase of the calculation .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "our bulk and surface model , reaction network , microscopic - macroscopic monte carlo approach , and its application to surface and bulk kinetics are described in the next section .",
    "we present our simulation results for cold dense interstellar clouds in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we compare these results with those of other models and observational results .",
    "finally , our conclusions and a discussion appear in section 5 .",
    "there are two mechanisms for bulk diffusion : substitutional diffusion and interstitial diffusion , although motion in internal pores can possibly be considered a third @xcite .",
    "the bulk diffusion mechanism used in previous models can be classified as substitutional diffusion  @xcite , in which pairs of bulk species have to replace each other in order to diffuse .",
    "interstitial diffusion , which refers to diffusion involving sites in between normal sites of the normal lattice structure , can be energetically more favorable because species in interstitial sites are generally less strongly bound to other species and there is no additional barrier due to swapping in order to diffuse . the diffusion of photodissociated species in the molecular dynamics simulation of  @xcite can be classified as interstitial in nature . in this work ,",
    "we focus on interstitial diffusion because our model is for temperatures below 20 k ; thus , substitutional diffusion is not the major mechanism because of its high barrier . on the other hand , because atomic h is found to be able to react with species in the top four monolayers of the ice mantle by substitutional diffusion  @xcite , we include substitutional diffusion in our simulations using a simplified approach as explained later .    to include interstitial diffusion and bulk reactions during the growth of an ice mantle , we modified our procedure for microscopic monte carlo simulation with a model that simulates impurity diffusion in semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "as in our earlier work  @xcite , grains are assumed to be uniform in size with radius @xmath2 m .",
    "we start from a bare flat surface where the desorption energy might be different from that on flat water ice ; however , because the initial desorption energy does not affect our results  @xcite , we still assume that it is the same as that on flat ice . using a density of regular sites obtained from experiments on high - density ice of @xmath3 @xmath4  @xcite",
    ", there are about @xmath5 regular sites on each grain .",
    "based on our microscopic monte carlo simulation of h@xmath0 formation  @xcite , a flat surface with @xmath6 sites is large enough to avoid a finite size effect while an inhomogeneous ( rough ) surface can be much smaller to avoid the effect because diffusing species such as h can be trapped on the sites with stronger binding strength and so lie in smaller clusters .",
    "a qualitative analysis of sites visited by species on grain surfaces shows that increasing the chemical complexity does not increase the minimum surface area needed to avoid a finite size effect .",
    "the more complex species , the greater the chance that traveling h atoms will react within a smaller cluster of sites .",
    "so we are able to use a surface , which is initially flat and then becomes rough as time evolves , with only @xmath6 sites , which constitute1% of the whole surface area in our simulation .",
    "based on our earlier work  @xcite , 1% of gas phase species around one dust particle is also enough to avoid an analogous finite size effect in the gas phase .",
    "we put these @xmath6 sites on a square lattice with dimension 200 @xmath7 200 .",
    "nodes in the lattice that have both even numbered x and y coordinates represent real binding sites on the grain surface , which we term `` normal . ''",
    "each normal site has six nearest neighbor sites , four in the same layer and two in upper and lower layers respectively .",
    "`` normal '' species , which are located on normal sites , can only move horizontally from one normal site to another one by moving two steps , over a potential that includes an intermediate site , which can not be occupied .",
    "nodes that have both odd numbered x and y coordinates represent interstitial sites , which are also surrounded by six nearest neighbor sites , four of which lie in the same layer .",
    "nodes that have an even numbered and an odd numbered coordinate are forbidden to be occupied at any time .    the horizontal structure of a monolayer is shown in panels a and b of figure  [ fig6 ] . in these panels ,",
    "the blue squares represent normal sites , which can only be occupied by normal species , while the yellow squares represent interstitial sites , which can only be occupied by interstitial species .",
    "the white squares can not be occupied . what differentiates panels a and b are the allowed processes on the surface , or topmost , monolayer ( panel a ) and any bulk ice monolayer ( panel b ) .",
    "on the surface , only normal species are allowed .",
    "they hop from one blue square to another , accrete onto blue squares , desorb into the gas from blue squares , and undergo photodissociation from blue squares .",
    "the lighter of the two photodissociation products moves to a nearest neighbor normal site while the heavier of the two remains in the site occupied by the parent .",
    "finally , chemical reactions can occur when two species are in the same normal site .",
    "these processes mimic the surface processes included in earlier treatments .",
    "motion in bulk layers involves the interstitial sites : like normal species on the surface , interstitial species in the bulk can undergo horizontal hopping to nearest neighbor interstitial sites and undergo reaction if two species wind up on the same interstitial site .",
    "interstitial species , however , can also undergo vertical hopping to upper and lower levels , and react if two end up in the same site .",
    "conversion between normal and interstitial species occurs via several processes .",
    "normal species in bulk layers can undergo photodissociation ; the lighter product ends up in an interstitial site .",
    "interstitial species become normal species when they move to the top layer , where there are no interstitial sites .",
    "essentially , instead of remaining in an interstitial site on the topmost layer , the hopping interstitial species is placed in a neighboring normal site .",
    "there is also a reactive process in which a species in an interstitial site reacts with one in a nearest neighbor normal site , with the product to be put in the normal site if there is only one product . if there is more than one product , that with the largest diffusion barrier is put in the normal site and all other products put in neighbor interstitial sites .    in order to simulate the chemical kinetics on and in grain mantles ,",
    "four parameters have to be specified .",
    "the first is the diffusion barrier on the top layer , @xmath8 , which determines how fast normal species hop from one normal site to another .",
    "the hopping rate is calculated as @xmath9 where @xmath10 , the second parameter , is the trial frequency and @xmath11 is the grain temperature .",
    "the trial frequency is set to be @xmath12 s@xmath13 which is lower than the standard value @xmath14 s@xmath13 .",
    "we use the lower value because the temperature dependent reaction barriers of h + co and h + h@xmath0co are fitted with the lower trial frequency  @xcite .",
    "the third is the desorption , or sublimation , energy , @xmath15 , which determines how rapidly normal species are thermally desorbed .",
    "the rate for sublimation is given by @xmath16 .",
    "the last parameter is the diffusion barrier within the bulk , e@xmath17 , which determines how rapidly interstitial species diffuse .",
    "the interstitial diffusion rate is given by @xmath18 .",
    "we choose the relation , @xmath19 for a flat icy surface  @xcite , with desorption energies for assorted species taken from  @xcite .",
    "however , the real surface may be rough , so normal species on the top layers may form lateral bonds with neighboring normal species .",
    "the actual diffusion barrier for normal species on these top layers is given by the expression @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the strength of lateral bonds formed between normal species and water ( the dominant ice ) , @xmath22 refers to a particular species , and @xmath23 is the number of lateral bonds . the strength of lateral bonds is not well known and has been chosen to ensure sufficient mobility for species and yet be strong enough to form h@xmath0 efficiently  @xcite .",
    "we only consider lateral bonds between normal species because the bond formed by normal species and interstitial species is weaker and also interstitial species will become normal species when they diffuse to the top of the grain mantle , so there are very few interstitial species on the top few layers .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath24 , which only refers to the normal species . for a detailed explanation of how we calculate @xmath8 and @xmath15",
    ", we refer to our earlier paper  @xcite .",
    "in fact , if we ignore interstitial sites and interstitial species , the bulk and surface models here are the same as what we used before  @xcite . in the work by  @xcite , which focuses on substitutional bulk diffusion ,",
    "the bulk diffusion barrier is chosen to be @xmath25 . here",
    "we focus on interstitial bulk diffusion , which is a different physical process and highly uncertain .",
    "however , because bulk diffusion is normally slower than diffusion on the surface , we choose the barrier to be @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "the first value will ensure that interstitial species will diffuse more slowly than normal species do on the top layers while small interstitial species such as h can still diffuse rapidly enough to lead to reactions even at 10 k. the second value essentially allows only the weakly bound atomic h to diffuse within the bulk .",
    "even atomic h can not diffuse within the bulk if we assume a higher value of @xmath28 , so it is not interesting to set @xmath28 at still higher levels .",
    "the physical conditions in our simulation pertain to cold dense cores .",
    "the chosen temperature is 10 k or 15 k and the density of h nuclei , @xmath29 , is fixed at @xmath30 @xmath4 .",
    "the cosmic - ray ionization rate is set at @xmath31 s@xmath13 .",
    "reactions , rate coefficients , and species are taken from  @xcite , with some exceptions . as noted previously by other authors",
    "@xcite , the sparse nature of the surface network can lead to catalytic pathways , which can eat up much of the atomic hydrogen , so that h atoms will be converted to h@xmath0 and so hinder the formation of species such as water and methanol .",
    "the two reactions below are excellent examples :    @xmath32    although these reactions have barriers of 1900 k and 500 k respectively , they appear to start catalytic cycles in which the products associate with h atoms to re - form the reactants unless there are competitive pathways , not considered in our network . it should be noted that the second reaction does not appear to be important in laboratory experiments leading to the formation of nh@xmath0oh on ice @xcite , while the first reaction must compete with the more standard products h@xmath33o + oh . in addition , as in  @xcite , we do not allow any h@xmath33 to remain on grains and so include no surface reactions involving h@xmath33 .",
    "we neglect surface h@xmath33 because the high abundance of gaseous h@xmath0 and the low desorption energy of molecular hydrogen on grain surfaces make monte carlo simulations that include rapid molecular hydrogen accretion and desorption not feasible currently  @xcite .",
    "some other granular reactions have reaction barriers and we adopt the values in @xcite except for the barriers pertaining to h + co and h + h@xmath0co , which are temperature dependent based on recent laboratory measurements  @xcite .",
    "the reaction barrier at 10 k is found by assuming that reaction rates for co + h and h@xmath0co + h at 10 k are the same as that at 12 k. in total , we include 4402 gas phase reactions other than accretion and 459 gas phase species .",
    "the number of surface / mantle reactions other than photodissociation and desorption is 238 and there are 193 surface species .",
    "the initial gas - phase abundances are listed in table  [ table1 ] , and are based on a particular assumption of low - metal abundances  @xcite .",
    "we assume an initial value for atomic hydrogen based on gas - phase models .",
    "the dust - to - gas number ratio is fixed at @xmath34 .",
    "photodissociation and photodesorption are included in our simulations .",
    "the far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) flux , @xmath35 , is given by the expression @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the external radiation scaling factor , @xmath38 is the scaling factor for cosmic ray induced photons based on the calculation of @xcite , and @xmath39 is the standard interstellar radiation field with a value of @xmath40 @xmath41 s@xmath13 .",
    "the exponential factor @xmath42 is set at 2 based on the experimental analysis of @xcite . because the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ radiation ] ) is much larger than the first term in dense clouds , the rate coefficient for photodissociation of a species @xmath22 , @xmath43 , is calculated based on the second term only in our simulation .    when photons hit grain surfaces , one important parameter for photodissociation is the probability that species in each monolayer absorb the photons .",
    "however , little is known about the probability of photon absorption per monolayer for different species except water , which was estimated theoretically to be @xmath44  @xcite . to obtain the probability of photon absorption per monolayer for a species @xmath22",
    ", we assume that this probability is proportional to the photodissociation rate on grain surfaces , and that these rates and products are the same as their gas - phase analogs .",
    "the probability of photodissociation for a molecule , @xmath22 , per monolayer is proportional to the overall photodissociation rate . for a molecule , i , it is @xmath45 , which is the sum of all rate of product channels @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we can estimate the probability that a species @xmath22 absorbs fuv photons per monolayer as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the photodissociation rate coefficient for water in the m - th product channel  @xcite .",
    ".initial gas phase abundances [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the results reported in this paper are from the first simulation using a full gas - grain chemical reaction network with a microscopic monte carlo treatment of the grain mantle chemistry .",
    "it is interesting to compare these new results with our mantle results from a previous monte carlo model , in which we used a rather limited set of surface 29 surface reactions , and did not consider photodissociation or bulk diffusion  @xcite . in the earlier paper ,",
    "a comparison with older rate - equation models was also made .",
    "table [ table6 ] shows a comparison between our current results for co , co@xmath33 , ch@xmath49oh , and ch@xmath50 ices and those of a previous monte carlo model ( model 3 ) with the same parameters as our current model 0 at 10 k so that only the number of grain mantle reactions differs .",
    "we also make a thorough comparison with observational results of a compendium of sources in front of background stars , high - mass ysos and low - mass ysos @xcite , adding nh@xmath49 to the list of molecules .",
    "the abundances are listed as percentages of the water ice abundance .",
    "the results from models 0 , 1 , and 2 are very similar , so that bulk diffusion and photodissociation are clearly not critical for the species shown .",

    "the agreement between current model 0 ( 10 k ) and the older model 3 ( 10 k ) is very good for co , co@xmath33 , and ch@xmath49oh , while the older model predicts somewhat more methane .",
    "regarding observations , the results of our model simulations are in reasonable agreement with the summary of observational results of  @xcite , especially at 15 k , although our results for co@xmath33 are a factor of a few too low except for high mass stars , and our results for ammonia are high by a factor 3 - 5 .",

    "the non - polar phase , produced later , is co - dominated with some conversion to formaldehyde and methanol .",
    "our simulations @xmath53 yr do show a slight trend of more abundant co and methanol at outer layers caused by the increased abundance of gas phase co and decreased abundance of atomic o at later times .",
    "however , even at the end of our simulation , h@xmath0o is always the most abundant species in each layer , as can be seen in figure  [ fig3 ] .",
    "this dominance can not be explained by the `` short '' evolution in our simulation because even with a three - phase rate equation model , which can be run to much longer times , h@xmath0o is always the most abundant species at each layer  @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation is that grains can undergo some thermal processing , which induces segregation or distillation of co@xmath0 or co  @xcite . in our simulations ,",
    "co molecules are able to move around within the ice mantle , but they can not evaporate between 15 k and 20 k so they may be able to diffuse gradually to the top layers and form co - rich layers .",
    "thus , the position of each molecule in the ice mantle may not be the actual positions where they were formed .",
    "however , a more complicated model with segregation or distillation coupled with the full gas - grain network simulation is not the purpose of this work .",
    "a major feature in the calculations reported here is the higher abundances of radicals with bulk diffusion and photon penetration included in models 1 and 2 .",
    "moreover , it is photon penetration that generates bulk diffusing species deeply buried within the ice in our simulation.in the work by  @xcite photodissociation reactions are allowed to occur at equal rates within ice mantle , however , the abundance of radicals was not reported in  @xcite .",
    "a high abundance of radicals was obtained by photodissociation of bulk ice in experiments of greenberg and colleagues @xcite and shown to lead to explosions when warmed up .",
    "although the grainoble model  @xcite also produces a significant abundance of radicals , the mechanism to form radicals is very different from that in our approach . in particular , the radicals formed with the grainoble model simulation are actually normal species that react with other species , which is equivalent to that in our earlier work  @xcite , where we also produced many radicals .",
    "however , with the introduction of the swap of h atoms and other species in the top 4 monolayers  @xcite , these radicals are almost completely destroyed , as occurs in model 0 .",
    "the radicals formed in model 1 are , on the other hand , almost all formed by photodissociation of stable species deeply buried in the ice mantle and by reaction with photodissociation products .",
    "we can qualitatively compare our results with those of the molecular dynamics ( md ) calculation by  @xcite . in this calculation",
    ", the products of photodissociated h@xmath0o at the sixth monolayer , covered by 5 monolayers of water ice , can recombine again with a probability of 0.4 so almost 60% of the photodissociated h@xmath0o molecules are frozen in the ice mantle in the form of oh radicals or water , formed from oh + h. this qualitatively agrees with our large abundance of radicals after introducing photon penetration .",
    "the ch@xmath54o radical , which is contained in our models , has been recently detected in the cold core b1-b with a low fractional abundance of @xmath55 in gas phase  @xcite .",
    "although the calculated granular ch@xmath54o fractional abundance in model 1 at 10 k is more than @xmath56 , because we do not include any very efficient non - thermal desorption mechanisms , the gas - phase ch@xmath54o radical abundance remains very low in our simulation .",
    "it is not clear if we can produce the gas phase abundance of ch@xmath54o radical with reactive desorption , which can efficiently desorb surface species .",
    "another new feature of our results is the prediction that complex organic molecules such as ch@xmath54ocho and ch@xmath54och@xmath54 can be formed on ice mantles at temperatures as low as 10 k with fractional abundances of a few @xmath7 10@xmath57 for ch@xmath54och@xmath54 and a few @xmath7 10@xmath58 for ch@xmath54ocho at @xmath53",
    "recent observations  @xcite show that the fractional abundance of these two complex organic molecules in the gas phase in cold cores is about a few 10@xmath59 .",
    "however , all ch@xmath54ocho or cho@xmath54ch@xmath54 molecules in our models only exist on grain surfaces because there is no efficient desoption mechanism included in our models .",
    "if 10% of these two complex organic molecules can be desorbed and not destroyed in the gas phase , their gaseous fractional abundance in our models will agree well with observations .",
    "however , because these two molecules can be destroyed in the gas phase , it is not clear if we can predict the observed abundance of these two complex organic molecules when an efficient desorption mechanism such as reactive desorption  @xcite is included .",
    "despite the fact that the microscopic - macroscopic monte carlo method is exceedingly computationally demanding , we have successfully simulated the gas - grain chemistry of a cold dense core with a gas - grain reaction network containing @xmath60 300 surface reactions . our simulations , which follow the chemical evolution for @xmath61 yr , represent a significant advance compared with our earlier microscopic monte carlo simulations , with fewer than 30 surface reactions  @xcite .",
    "the new simulations have been made possible by the use of an improved and more efficient algorithm , in which the species in the simulations are divided into three groups depending on the strength of their binding energy to the grain . with this algorithm , we are able to follow additional processes involving the chemistry that occur in the bulk of the ice mantle .",
    "these processes include photon penetration and molecular dissociation caused by the penetrating photons .",
    "moreover , we are also able to follow a bulk chemistry occurring on interstitial sites located between sites of normal binding energy and maintained by photo - production of radicals . we have focused the discussion in this paper on grain mantle species because species heavier than hydrogen and helium can not efficiently desorb at temperatures below 15 k. the result is that the abundances of the gas - phase species in our three models are similar to those in two - phase models , where no distinction is made between surface and bulk mantle . in a subsequent paper , we will include non - thermal reactive desorption so that all species on the grain surface can efficiently desorb ; the abundances of gas phase species will then be more tightly coupled with the chemical composition of the ice mantle .",
    "our simulations show that the abundances of major stable ice species are not affected appreciably by photon penetration ; thus , the simulation results concerning stable major species in our previous study of cold cores are still valid",
    ". moreover , the results of both our past and current models agree reasonably well with observations of the abundance of major species for sources toward high mass ysos , low mass ysos , and background stars .",
    "the major difference between the current work and past work has to do with the calculated granular abundances of radicals .",
    "formed mainly by photodissociation , the radicals can be enhanced in abundance by up to two orders of magnitude over models without this process in the bulk .",
    "the high abundance of radicals qualitatively agrees with recent studies using rate equations  @xcite or molecular dynamical simulations  @xcite .",
    "the bulk diffusion of light species formed by photodissociation can also lead to the formation of other radicals by interstitial reactions , a process never before included in previous models , although a similar model with pores has been reported @xcite .",
    "with all the radicals trapped within ice mantles , especially at 10 k , chains of chemical reactions can occur when thermal processing of ice mantles occurs and the radicals are able to move more freely .",
    "in this instance , explosions might even occur  @xcite .",
    "this more complicated scenario will be included in a future study .",
    "our simulations also show that the chemistry occurring on and in grain mantles might be far more complex than it seems to be , especially when we treat ice mantle layers other than the topmost layer as a partially chemically active phase , and bulk diffusion of species within the ice mantle .",
    "indeed , the ice mantle , especially deep inside it , is a particularly ideal location for radical - radical association reactions because radicals will not find many other species with which to react .",
    "other types of reactive species accreting from the gas will not approach deeply buried radicals , and in addition , there are few atoms available deep in the bulk . so the temperature range where radical - radical association reaction dominate should be much broader than when these reactions happen on the topmost layers where radicals can be easily depleted by the large amount of species accreting from the gas phase and , in addition , these radicals can evaporate when the temperature is high enough , as occurs in later stages .",
    "moreover , the fact that complex organic molecules such as ch@xmath54och@xmath54 can be formed on the topmost ice layers when the temperature is as low as 10 k further illustrates the major difference between reactions on the grain surface and those in the gas phase . unlike the gas phase , because species are packed densely in ice mantles , three - body reactions such as the chain reaction mechanism occur frequently within the ice .",
    "it should be emphasized that interstitial bulk diffusion , which describes how molecules diffuse within a crystal lattice , is a realistic physical process , and might be the dominant bulk process at temperatures as low as 10 k. moreover , when a molecule is photodissociated within the bulk , if potential minima around this molecule are normally occupied , some products of the photodissociation reaction have to stay in interstitial sites .",
    "thus , we must take into account interstitial sites in modeling and simulation if we allow species deeply buried within ice mantle to be photodissociated .",
    "however , it remains a large challenge to calculate the location of interstitial sites if we want to adopt a more rigorous off - lattice microscopic monte carlo approach  @xcite .",
    "based on such a simulation , the ice formed on a grain surface is non - porous if the gas density pertains to typical dark clouds ( @xmath62 ) ; however , an ice mantle can be porous with a gas phase density much higher than that of typical dark clouds ( @xmath63 )  @xcite .",
    "if an ice mantle formed on a grain surface is porous , our interstitial bulk diffusion model has to be modified .",
    "the details that can be obtained with a microscopic model of the grain chemistry should allow us to understand much better the different environments , both polar and non - polar , on grain mantles .",
    "but to understand these environments better than we currently do , we may have to add more complex physical processes such as segregation , or distillation dynamics , into the simulation .",
    "these processes may change our results significantly because light species such as co may tend to be more abundant in outer layers with segregation or distillation dynamics included than in our current models . although it would be worthwhile to study the further details of mantle chemistry",
    ", the unified microscopic - macroscopic monte carlo simulation has a serious problem : it takes too much simulation time .",
    "for instance , at 15 k , models 1 and 2 take more than 8 days to simulate the evolution of the system through @xmath64 years with our dell presion t7500n workstation .",
    "because of the high computational cost , we have not yet been able to simulate the chemistry occurring during the warm - up phase of stellar evolution , which should be very interesting . besides this very serious problem",
    ", other issues remain outstanding .",
    "for example , most of the surface reactions in our network with experimentally determined activation energy barriers have not been fitted by the competition mechanism in our simulation  @xcite , with the exception of co + h and h@xmath0co + h , so it is not clear if we can still use these barriers , especially if determined from gas - phase reactions , for simulation by our approach . finally , whether we use a microscopic or even a macroscopic monte carlo simulation for the grain chemistry , reactions involving h@xmath0 on and in the grain mantle",
    "can not be treated correctly because the rapid accretion and desorption of h@xmath0 make monte carlo simulations currently not feasible .",
    "some approximations and/or more powerful computers have to be introduced to solve this problem .",
    "we are thankful to the referee for suggestions for revision that have improved this paper .",
    "eh wishes to acknowledge the support of the national science foundation for his astrochemistry program .",
    "he also acknowledges support from the nasa exobiology and evolutionary biology program through a subcontract from rensselaer polytechnic institute .",
    "we thank anton i. vasyunin for helpful discussions and allowing us to use his rate equation codes and network ."
