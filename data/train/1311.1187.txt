    "various modern wireless systems , such as sensor rfid networks @xcite and body area networks with implantable devices @xcite-@xcite , challenge the conventional assumption that the energy received from an information bearing signal can not be reused .",
    "for instance , implantable devices can be powered by the received radio signal , hence alleviating the need for a battery and reducing significantly the size of the devices .",
    "this realization has motivated a number of research groups to investigate the design of wireless systems under joint information and energy transfer requirements .",
    "the research activity in this area has focused so far on optimal resource allocation in the presence of information and energy transfer for various network topologies .",
    "specifically , reference @xcite studied a single point - to - point channel , while @xcite@xcite investigated power allocation for a set of parallel point - to - point channels under energy transfer and information rate constraints .",
    "the optimization of beamforming strategies under the same criteria was studied in @xcite-@xcite for multiantenna broadcast channels and for two - user multiantenna interference channels in @xcite .",
    "optimal resource allocation assuming wireless energy transfer was also investigated in @xcite for cellular systems , in @xcite-@xcite for relay systems , in @xcite for two - way interactive channels , and in @xcite for graphical multi - hop networks .",
    "considerations on the design of the receiver under the constraint that , when harvesting energy from the antenna , the receiver is not able to use the same signal for information decoding , can be found in @xcite .    unlike all prior work summarized above",
    ", this work focuses on the _ code design _ for systems with joint information and energy transfer .",
    "we focus on a point - to - point link as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , in which the receiver s energy requirements are modeled as a random process .",
    "the statistics of this process generally depend on the specific application to be run at the receiver , e.g. , sensing or radio transmission . the performance in terms of energy transfer",
    "is measured by the probabilities of overflow and underflow of the battery at the receiver .",
    "the probability of overflow measures the efficiency of energy transfer by accounting for the energy wasted at the receiver . instead , the probability of underflow is a measure of the fraction of the time in which the application run at the receiver is in outage due to the lack of energy .",
    "classical codes , which are designed with the only aim of maximizing the information rate , are unstructured ( i.e. , random - like ) , see , e.g. , @xcite . as a result , they do not allow to control the timing of the energy transfer , and hence to optimize the probability of overflow and underflow . with this in mind , here it is proposed to adopt constrained run - length limited ( rll ) codes @xcite in lieu of conventional unconstrained codes .",
    "the constraints defining rll codes ensure that the code does not includes bursts of energy either too frequently , thus limiting battery overflow , or too infrequently , thus controlling battery underflow .",
    "constrained rll codes have been traditionally studied for applications related to magnetic and optical storage @xcite .",
    "the application to the problem at hand of energy transfer has been previously studied in the context of point - to - point rfid systems in @xcite , although no analysis of the information - energy trade - off was provided .",
    "in contrast , in this work , a thorough analysis is provided of the interplay between information rate ad energy transfer in terms of probabilities of battery overflow and underflow .",
    "the analysis reveals that , by properly choosing the parameters that define rll codes depending on the receiver s utilization requirements , constrained codes allow to greatly improve the system performance in terms of simultaneous energy and information transfer .",

    "we do not consider this extension in this work . ] . at the receiver side , upon reception of an energy - carrying signal @xmath3 , the energy contained in the signal is harvested .",
    "the harvested energy is temporarily held in a supercapacitor and , if not used in the current time interval @xmath0 , is stored in a battery , whose capacity limited to @xmath6 energy units ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the receiver s energy utilization is modeled as a stochastic process @xmath7 , so that @xmath8 indicates that the receiver requires one unit of energy at time @xmath0 , while @xmath9 implies that no energy is required by the receiver at time @xmath0 .",
    "this process is not known at the transmitter and evolves according to the markov chain shown in fig .",
