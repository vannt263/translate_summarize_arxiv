    "supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite is a popular extension of the standard model , which renders natural its large mass hierarchy : @xmath1 .",
    "since the number of particles in even the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) is more than doubled , a number of new tree - level interactions are allowed , some of which violate baryon and/or lepton number . a discrete symmetry called @xmath0 parity is often imposed to forbid all such interactions .",
    "alternatively , one may consider a broader class of theories containing such interactions , and constrain their coupling constants to be small enough that they do not conflict with experimental observations @xcite and cosmological bounds @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-non - conserving interactions that violate lepton number have the important feature that they can be moved around the lagrangian by field redefinitions @xcite , introducing a possible ambiguity that should be taken into account when evaluating these constraints .",
    "this is not in general a serious problem with accelerator bounds , because there it is clear that one is working in the mass - eigenstate basis .",
    "however , in cosmology the correct choice of basis is less clear , because the mass - eigenstate basis changes with temperature , and an interaction - eigenstate basis would be more natural .",
    "a desirable resolution of this ambiguity is to define expressions that are independent of the basis chosen for the fields to measure the amount of @xmath0 violation , which is the purpose of this letter .    in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) with @xmath0 conservation",
    ", the superpotential can be written in the form w = _ h |h h + h_u^ij |h q_i u^c_j + h_d^ij h q_i d^c_j + h_e^ij h l_i e^c_j [ s1 ] where @xmath2 are quark and lepton generation indices .",
    "in addition to the supersymmetric interactions parametrized by ( [ s1 ] ) , one must introduce soft susy - breaking terms which include + b_h |h h + a_u^ij |h q_i u^c_j + a_d^ij h q_i d^c_j + a_e^ij h l_i e^c_j [ soft ] as well as gaugino mass terms .",
    "we use capitalized fields to represent both the superfields ( as in eqn ( [ s1 ] ) ) and their scalar components ( as in eqn ( [ soft ] ) ) . equation ( [ soft ] ) and the lagrangian derived from ( [ s1 ] ) are invariant under the multiplicatively - conserved @xmath3 global symmetry @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the baryon number of any field , @xmath6 is its lepton number , and @xmath7 is its spin .",
    "once we allow for interactions that do not conserve @xmath0 , we can add four more @xmath5- or @xmath6-violating terms to the superpotential : w_r / = _ i h l_i + _",
    "1^ijk l_il_j e^c_k + _ 2^ijk l_iq_jd^c_k + _",
    "3^ijk u^c_id^c_jd^c_k [ s2 ] in this letter we do not consider @xmath8 , and concentrate on the @xmath6-violating interactions @xmath9 . to appreciate the meaning of these terms , it is convenient to recall that the higgs field @xmath10 and the lepton doublets @xmath11 have the same gauge quantum numbers . in the standard model",
    ", they are distinguished by the fact that the higgs is a scalar , and the leptons are fermions carrying global quantum number that are automatically conserved if the neutrinos are massless . in the mssm with the minimal superpotential ( [ s1 ] ) ,",
    "lepton number is still conserved .",
    "however , susy removes the distinction between @xmath10 and the @xmath11 based on their spins , and once we allow for @xmath0 violation , there is no unambiguous distinction between the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 , and we can assemble them in a vector _",
    "i = ( h , l_i ) [ phi ] whose index @xmath12 runs from 0 to 3 .",
    "a lagrangian contains @xmath0 violation if different interactions choose conflicting directions in @xmath13 space to be the higgs .    combining ( [ s1 ] ) and ( [ s2 ] ) , writing @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and neglecting @xmath8 as already mentioned , we may write the superpotential as w= ^i |h _ i + _ e^ijk _ i _ j e^c_k + _ d^ijk _ iq_jd^c_k + h_u^ij |h q_i u^c_j[s ] this parametrization could be extended to discuss soft susy - breaking terms , but we shall not do so in this paper .",
    "the appearance of @xmath0 violation can be moved around the lagrangian by unitary transformations on the fields , depending on what interaction one uses to define the higgs .",
    "one must therefore be careful to specify the basis in which one is working , or else discuss @xmath0 violation in a basis - independent formalism .",
    "in this letter , we opt for the latter , and construct combinations of coupling constants which are zero when @xmath0 is conserved , and which are independent of the basis transformations in @xmath17 space .",
    "we normalise these invariants relative to the magnitudes of the superpotential couplings in ( [ s ] ) , so that they provide some measure of the relative magnitude of @xmath0 violation present .",
    "we present geometrical interpretations of these invariants , as well as generic diagrams that give rise to them .",
    "we then discuss briefly cosmological constraints on @xmath0 violation , as an example how the invariants can be used . in this letter ,",
    "we work in the absence of soft supersymmetry breaking and gauge symmetry breaking ; a more complete analysis will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "as warm - up exercises which help provide some intuition , we first discuss two toy examples : first a one - generation model , and then a model with two generations of leptons , but only one generation of quarks .    consider a one - generation version of the superpotential ( [ s ] ) : this means that upper - case indices run from 0 to 1 , and there are no lower - case indices . since @xmath18 is antisymmetric in the indices @xmath19",
    ", there is no @xmath20 interaction in this model , and the yukawa coupling @xmath21 is invariant under rotations in @xmath13 space .",
    "however , by its presence , the @xmath18 interaction forces one direction in @xmath13 space to be a lepton .",
    "the higgs can be defined either from the @xmath22 term , or from the @xmath23 term .",
    "if , for instance , the basis in @xmath13 space is chosen such that @xmath24 , then the superpotential becomes w = _ h |h h + h_u |h q u^c + h_d h q d^c + h_e h l e^c + _ 2 lqd^c where the @xmath0 violation is contained in _ 2 = alternatively , one could choose a ( primed ) basis such that @xmath25 , but @xmath26^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "it is clear that @xmath0 parity is broken in this model if two conditions are satisfied .",
    "firstly , @xmath27 must be present , so that one direction in @xmath13 space is a lepton , and secondly @xmath28 and @xmath29 must choose different directions in @xmath13 space to be the higgs .",
    "a measure of @xmath30 violation is then the length of the component of @xmath29 that is orthogonal to @xmath28 : @xmath31 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f1](a ) .",
    "it is helpful to normalize this measure by dividing it by the lengths of the vectors @xmath28 and @xmath29 : = the basis - dependent @xmath0-violating coupling @xmath32 is then @xmath33 , and similiarly @xmath34 .",
    "another way to express the invariant measure of @xmath0 violation in this model is = where @xmath35 .",
    "this is the same expression as previously discussed , but has the advantage of including also the yukawa coupling , which must be present for the model to violate @xmath0 .",
    "we prefer this formulation , because it can readily be generalized to more generations .",
    "in fact , it is more appropriate to use the square of this expression as a measure of @xmath0 violation , because it corresponds to a closed - loop feynman diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ f1](b ) ) , such as would appear in a zero temperature rate calculation .",
    "we therefore advocate _ 1 = as the invariant measure of @xmath0 violation in this simple one - generation model .",
    "we now discuss the second toy model .",
    "it has two lepton generations , so the matrices @xmath36 enter in a non - trivial way , but the @xmath13 space is three - dimensional , so that it is easy to understand geometrically the invariants found below .",
    "suppose one has a superpotential of the form ( [ s ] ) , with upper case indices that run from 0 to 2 and lower case lepton indices that run from 1 to 2 .",
    "the coupling constants define a number of directions in @xmath13 space : @xmath28 and @xmath29 correspond to directions that one could choose to be the higgs , and each @xmath27 determines a plane spanned by a higgs and a lepton .",
    "the intersection of the two planes chooses a direction for the higgs .",
    "each plane can therefore be written as the cross product of the higgs and an orthogonal vector corresponding to the lepton : ^ijp = l^ip h^j - h^i l^jp as vectors in @xmath13 space , the @xmath37 depend on the choice of basis for the right - handed leptons . to see this ,",
    "imagine choosing the higgs to correspond to the direction @xmath38 ; the index @xmath12 on @xmath37 then runs from 1 to 2 , like @xmath39 , and @xmath37 has the same form as the @xmath40 yukawa matrix .",
    "it can be diagonalised by independent unitary transformations on the left- and right - handed fields ( i.e. , on the @xmath12 and @xmath39 indices ) , which means that the two @xmath37 , regarded as vectors in @xmath41 space , are orthogonal only for a specific choice of basis for the @xmath39 indices .",
    "this model violates @xmath0 parity if the direction chosen by one interaction to be the higgs has a non - zero inner product with the direction chosen by another interaction to be a lepton .",
    "there are therefore three scalars one can construct that measure  .",
    "if one projects @xmath28 onto the plane associated with one of the yukawa couplings , it picks out the direction in the plane to be identified with the higgs .",
    "the orthogonal direction is therefore a lepton , and its inner product with @xmath29 : @xmath42 , is a measure of @xmath0 violation , see fig .",
    "[ f1](c ) .",
    "this expression is not yet completely satisfactory , because it carries a right - handed lepton index @xmath39 , and so is not fully basis - independent .",
    "this defect can be remedied by multiplying it by its complex conjugate , and summing over @xmath39 : _ 1 = this measure of @xmath0 violation is invariant under all basis transformations and corresponds to the closed supergraph shown in fig .",
    "[ f1](b ) .",
    "however , we should emphasize that one disadvantage of summing over right - handed lepton indices is that we now only have a measure of total @xmath6 violation , and are not able to determine whether one of the individual @xmath11 might be conserved .",
    "we see also that @xmath0 is not conserved if the direction chosen to be the higgs by the two yukawa couplings has a component perpendicular to @xmath28 or @xmath29 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) .",
    "let us consider @xmath28 ( the invariant for @xmath29 will be a straightforward modification ) .",
    "we wish to know the length of the component of @xmath28 in the plane spanned by the two leptons @xmath43 .",
    "it is clear that , up to an overall normalization , this is |l^1|^2 |l^2",
    "|^2 + | l^2|^2 |l^1|^2 - 2 ( l^1 ) ( l^1 l^2 ) ( l^2 ) where the @xmath13 indices are suppressed .",
    "note that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are not orthogonal in a generic basis .",
    "writing this expression in terms of the matrices @xmath36 , we get _ 2 = [ compl1 ] which corresponds to the difference between the supergraphs of fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) .",
    "the trace is over the capitalised indices , and the lower case indices are also summed .",
    "a similar expression for @xmath29 , corresponding to the difference between the supergraphs of fig .  [ f3 ] , gives _",
    "3 = [ compl2 ] which completes our enumeration of measures of @xmath0 violation in this second toy model , to this order in the couplings .",
    "we are now in a position to generalize to the physical situation of three lepton generations . in this case , not only are the yukawa coupling matrices @xmath36 non - invariant under @xmath13 basis transformations , but they can also contain @xmath0 violation independently of the other interactions present . in the limit where there is no , they define a plane in @xmath13 space that is spanned by the higgs and a lepton .",
    "the @xmath46 and @xmath47 again define directions in @xmath13 space that one would like to interpret as higgs fields . in the absence of @xmath0 violation , these two directions coincide with the higgs direction chosen by the planes of the three leptonic yukawa matrices @xmath36 .",
    "the simultaneous presence of at least three interactions is required in order to provide @xmath0 violation .",
    "1 ) at least one yukawa coupling must be present , so as to force one plane in @xmath13 space to contain a lepton and a higgs .",
    "2 ) the second interaction can choose which direction in this plane is the higgs .",
    "3 ) the third interaction must then specify a direction that conflicts with this choice .",
    "since one must square the amplitude in order to obtain a rate , our invariants involve at least six coupling constants .    for simplicity , we do not consider expressions involving more than the minimum three coupling constants required to obtain @xmath0 violation .",
    "the list we now present consists of all the invariants that can be constructed out of three coupling constants , assuming that at least one of them is a @xmath27 and summing over all three generations .",
    "this list is complete , in the sense that at least one of the invariants is non - zero if the theory contains @xmath0 violation at this order .    in an exactly supersymmetric theory ,",
    "the following squares of combinations of three coupling - constant matrices are invariant under transformations in @xmath13 space , and zero in an @xmath0-conserving theory : _ 1 = [ sug1 ] _ 2 = [ sug2 ] _ 3= [ sug3 ]    _ 4",
    "= [ sug4 ]    _ 5 = [ sug5 ] the traces are over the capitalized @xmath13 indices .",
    "the lower - case indices correspond to quark and right - handed lepton generations , and are also summed .",
    "the numerators correspond to the closed supergraphs of figures [ f1 ] , [ f2 ] , [ f3 ] , [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] , respectively . the magnitudes of the matrices and vectors in the denominators of the above expressions are defined by ||^2 = _ i _ i _ i^ * [ mag1 ] |_d|^2 = _ ipq _ d^ipq _ d^ipq * [ mag2 ] |_e|^2 = _ ijr _ e^ijr _ e^ijr * [ mag3 ] there are two new invariants in this three - generation model , shown in figures  [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] .",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath27 now contain @xmath0 violation all by themselves , which is measured by @xmath48 .",
    "it is also possible that the various @xmath29 ( there are nine of them in the case of three quark generations ) might choose different directions in @xmath13 space to be the higgs : @xmath49 measures the component of @xmath50 perpendicular to @xmath51 .",
    "one can see by inspection that these combinations are zero in an @xmath0-conserving theory , and contain the minimal ( because the invariants correspond to squares of matrix elements ) two powers of the @xmath0-violating coupling constants from equation ( [ s2 ] ) .",
    "the uses of the invariants we have defined above are limited by the fact that we have neglected soft supersymmetry breaking and have not included the higgs vev .",
    "however , these restrictions do not hinder application in the early universe above the electroweak phase transition ( ept ) .",
    "a limitation that is more serious for this application is that we have also summed over the quark and right - handed lepton indices .",
    "we plan to address this and the previous deficiencies in a subsequent publication @xcite .",
    "however , we can already use the above invariants to discuss cosmological constraints on @xmath0 violation , providing we restrict ourselves to sums over quarks and right - handed leptons .",
    "we will first review these cosmological constraints , then calculate them in a one - generation model , where there are no unwanted sums , and finally discuss the constraints on our invariants in the three - generation case .    in many cosmological scenarios , the survival of the baryon asymmetry can provide strong bounds on @xmath0 violation . if the asymmetry was created before the ept , it would have to contend with the anomalous electroweak @xmath52-violating processes known to be present in the thermal bath before the ept . for a baryon asymmetry to survive , there would have to be a @xmath53 asymmetry .",
    "if @xmath0-violating interactions were also present in the thermal bath , the asymmetry would be washed out if they took @xmath53 to zero . requiring all @xmath0-violating interaction rates to be less than the expansion rate ,",
    "so that they are unable to perpetrate this catastrophe , may yield strong bounds on the coupling constants of ( [ s2 ] ) .",
    "however , there are two loopholes in this argument : the baryon asymmetry may be made at the ept , or the @xmath0-violating interactions that are in thermal equilibrium may only wash out one lepton number , e.g. , @xmath54 , and not wash out @xmath53 . for the purposes of this section , we neglect these loopholes .",
    "we require all @xmath0-violating interactions to be out of thermal equilibrium at @xmath55 gev , which we assume to be of the same order as the supersymmetric particle masses and the ept temperature .",
    "we assume that the supersymmetric particles are present with a density @xmath56 in the thermal bath , and neglect mass effects , whose inclusion would change the bounds only slightly  @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetry - breaking scalar masses are not present in the invariants , so it is consistent to neglect the contribution of these masses to @xmath0-violating rates .    as an example of the estimation of such a rate",
    ", we consider @xmath57 ( [ sug1 ] ) , first in the one - generation model , and then with three generations . in the one - generation case , it is clear that if all of the rates associated with the interactions @xmath28 , @xmath27 and @xmath29 are not in equilibrium , i.e. , greater than the expansion rate @xmath10 , the corresponding coupling constant can be effectively neglected .",
    "in fact , all the interactions of the mssm are in thermal equilibrium before the ept , so this condition is satisfied . in the one - generation toy model , the @xmath0-violating rate is _ r / _ 1 _ min [ del1rate ] where @xmath58 is the smaller of the rates associated with @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , the @xmath0-violating coupling constants in the one - generation model are @xmath61 and/or @xmath62 : @xmath27 enters into @xmath57 only to ensure that some direction in @xmath13 space is a lepton .",
    "we constrain ( [ del1rate ] ) to be out of equilibrium .",
    "the rates associated with @xmath59 and @xmath60 are estimated  @xcite to be : _ 10 ^ -2 ,  _ _ d 10 ^ -2 _",
    "d^2 t taking @xmath63 gev , @xmath64 , the bound @xmath65 yields < 10 ^ -11 [ star ] if we assume self - consistently that @xmath0 violation is small , we can work in the mssm thermal mass eigenstate basis , as is appropriate just before the electroweak phase transition .",
    "in this basis ( [ star ] ) gives the bounds < 3 10 ^ -6 ,  _",
    "d^1 < 10 ^ -7 [ 27 ] note that this bound on @xmath61 is considerably weaker than what one would obtain naively by requiring the rate associated with a mass term @xcite to be out of equilibrium : ~10 ^ -2 ( ) ^2 t h [ old ] which would give @xmath66 gev .    in our invariant approach ,",
    "it is easier to understand when @xmath0 violation is ( or is not ) in equilibrium in the early universe . in the basis - dependent approach",
    ", one can move the @xmath0 violation from the mass terms to the yukawa terms .",
    "interaction rates associated with masses and yukawa couplings scale differently with temperature , so the temperature at which the @xmath0 violation goes in or out of equilibrium appears to depend on the basis one chooses .",
    "this confusion is avoided by noting that all the interactions that enter into the definition of an invariant must be in equilibrium , as well as the invariant times one of the rates , e.g. , ( [ del1rate ] ) .    in the case of three generations",
    ", the invariants we have defined can not be used to estimate rates so easily , because we have summed over the quark and right - handed lepton - generation indices .",
    "these sums made the invariants independent of basis transformations on all the fields .",
    "however , since it is only the rotations in @xmath13 space that move the @xmath0 violation around , for practical purposes we can drop the sums over the quark and right - handed lepton indices .",
    "the `` invariants '' are then basis - dependent , and we compute them in the thermal mass - eigenstate basis for quarks and right - handed leptons , which should be the right basis in which to compute rates in the early universe . in principle , it would be better to quote bounds on the `` invariants '' , as in ( [ star]),rather than on terms from the sum making them up , as in ( [ 27 ] ) because there could be cancellations between the different contributions . however , assuming such cancellations do not take place , the bounds we now present are easier to interpret .",
    "we consider again , as an example , @xmath57 . in the absence of the sums over lower - case indices",
    ", we now have 27 invariants : there are three @xmath27 , and nine @xmath29 , because the leptonic yukawa - coupling matrices are diagonal in the thermal mass - eigenstate basis , but the quark yukawa couplings are not .",
    "the @xmath0-violating entries in @xmath27 do not contribute to @xmath57 at lowest order , so we neglect them . in the mass - eigenstate basis",
    ", @xmath67 will therefore pick out the plane in @xmath13 space spanned by the higgs and the lepton @xmath68 .",
    "this case now resembles the one - generation toy model that we considered previously , except that now there are nine possible vectors @xmath69 in @xmath13 space . for each @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    ", we have 10 ^ -2 | _",
    "d^rs|^2 t < h at @xmath55 gev . if one chooses to work in the mssm thermal mass - eigenstate basis , i.e. , assume that @xmath0 violation is small , one gets the following generic basis - dependent bounds : < 3 10 ^ -6  ,   _",
    "d^prs < 10 ^ -7 [ what ] where @xmath72 run from 1 to 3 , and we have assumed that @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the bottom - quark yukawa coupling .",
    "similarly , we do not sum over the quark and right - handed lepton indices in the invariants @xmath75 and @xmath49 , but instead compute `` invariants '' with the quarks and right - handed leptons in the thermal mass - eigenstate basis . requiring that the rates associated with these `` invariants '' be smaller than the expansion rate of the universe at @xmath76 gev",
    ", we obtain the generic bound 10 ^ -7 where @xmath77 is some @xmath0-violating coupling in the mssm thermal mass - eigenstate basis .",
    "we also get a bound on @xmath78 from @xmath79 , but it is weaker than ( [ what ] ) because the bottom - quark yukawa coupling is larger than that of the @xmath80 .",
    "our generic bounds on the @xmath0-violating dimensionless coupling constants @xmath81 ( see equation ( [ s2 ] ) ) are the same as previously calculated @xcite .",
    "the constraint on @xmath82 is weaker , because the bound had previously been estimated by requiring that @xmath83 .",
    "however , since the gauge interactions are diagonal in @xmath13 space , they do not mix the different @xmath41 , so the bound on @xmath82 comes from the mass corrections to the yukawa interactions , as demonstrated by our analysis of invariants - violating soft supersymmetry - breaking mass . in this case , the mass - eigenstate bases for the fermions and scalars are different , so the d - term interactions violate @xmath0 and the bound on the @xmath0-violating soft supersymmetry - breaking masses would be of order ( [ old ] ) . if @xmath82 is rotated away in a theory with soft supersymmetry - breaking masses , it generates @xmath0-violating scalar masses proportional to soft mass differences , so the bound ( [ old ] ) would still be overly optimistic , assuming that these mass differences are small . ] .",
    "we have presented in this paper an analysis of @xmath0 violation in supersymmetric models that is formulated in terms of basis - independent measures , in analogy with the treatment of cp violation in  @xcite .",
    "the enumeration of these measures is quite complicated in general , and we have presented here a simplified analysis in which soft supersymmetry - breaking masses and higgs v.e.v.s are neglected .",
    "this restriction still permits @xmath0-violating rates in the early universe to be discussed , and we have presented an analysis of the generic bounds obtained in one- and three - generation models , using all the invariant measures of @xmath0-violating rates that appear up to sixth order in the couplings .",
    "our upper limits on generic yukawa couplings are similar to those obtained previously  @xcite , but our bounds on the supersymmetric mass - mixing parameters @xmath82 are less restrictive .    we have not studied in this paper loopholes in these cosmological bounds , which may be exploited if the baryonic asymmetry is generated at the ept , or if there is a conserved quantum number or flavour symmetry that preserves a pre - existing baryon asymmetry , or if there are cancellations among the different contributions to our invariants . these and the inclusion of soft supersymmetry breaking and higgs v.e.v.s remain to be analyzed in future work  @xcite .",
