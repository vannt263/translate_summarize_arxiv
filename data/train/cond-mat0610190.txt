    "developing robust mechanisms for spin generation and detection is a central objective in the rapidly growing field of spintronics.@xcite there are many exciting venues for basic physics and nanotechnology to exploit injected spins in various systems , in both the semiclassical transport regime and the quantum regime where spins can encode entangled quantum bits . since the early days of spintronics,@xcite however , exciting theoretical predictions often seemed to be plagued by experimental ambiguities .",
    "a notable exception is the field of metallic magnetoelectronics,@xcite where many of key experimental findings have been well understood and the theoretical predictions in turn were instrumental in pushing the experimental frontier .",
    "semiconductor spintronics which possesses much richer phenomenology and appears more desirable for technological applications , however , has caused more problems for theorists and experimentalists alike .    in systems with intrinsic spin - orbit ( so )",
    "coupling , the spin degrees of freedom are intricately entangled with the orbital motion , and even the concept of spin current ( defined as a symmetrized product of spin and velocity operators ) has resisted the thorough qualitative understanding.@xcite there is an opinion that for many experimental implications , it is more relevant to calculate spin densities rather than spin currents .",
    "this is a principal motivation of this paper .",
    "the spin - density generation and dynamics in diffuse bulk semiconductors are conveniently described by the semiclassical diffusion equation which is usually derived in the limit of weak so coupling and dilute disorder,@xcite @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the characteristic so splitting , @xmath7 is the impurity scattering rate , and @xmath8 is the fermi energy ( setting @xmath9 here and henceforth ) . in order to calculate the nonequilibrium spin accumulation generated by the spin hall effect at a hall - bar edge or at a boundary between two different conductors , the diffusion equation has to be supplemented by the appropriate boundary conditions ( bc ) for spin and charge densities .",
    "the latter have been the source of a vigorous discussion in recent literature.@xcite in addition , the boundary problem with so interactions was previously discussed in the context of spin - polarized ballistic beam reflection and refraction@xcite and in the regime of friedel - like spin - density oscillations on the scale of the fermi wavelength at sharp boundaries.@xcite    in this paper , we develop a general approach for systematically deriving semiclassical bc for diffuse spin transport with weak intrinsic so interaction .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 , but we work in the  so dirty limit , \" where @xmath11 and the dyakonov - perel spin - diffusion length @xmath1 is much larger than the electron mean free path @xmath2 .",
    "( this limit is , in fact , necessary for the diffusion equation itself to be meaningful near a boundary . )",
    "we use a keldysh kinetic equation approach,@xcite similar in spirit to the one used in ref .   for deriving the spin - diffusion equation .",
    "our method reveals the physical meaning of the bc , which possesses an interesting correspondence with the classical hall physics .",
    "we believe that our findings resolve some discrepancies existing in the literature .",
    "of central importance as a convenient case study as well as an experimentally relevant model is the noninteracting rashba hamiltonian which describes the simplest two - dimensional system with intrinsic so coupling:@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the canonical momentum , @xmath15 the electron charge , @xmath16 a vector potential , @xmath17 the effective electron mass , @xmath18 a vector of pauli matrices , @xmath19 the potential due to disorder and external gates , and @xmath0 is the rashba so interaction parameter , which here depends on the position .",
    "the second coupling constant @xmath20 is equal to @xmath0 for pure rashba coupling , but the situation @xmath21 applies , e.g. , to structures on a [ 001 ] surface of gaas , when linear dresselhaus coupling is present , if the @xmath22 axis is chosen along the ( 110 ) crystal direction .",
    "note that we are disregarding the so coupling due to the lateral potential @xmath19 , and the electrons are moving in the @xmath23 plane .",
    "although our approach is general and can be applied to other so hamiltonians and different heterostructures , we will focus on the bc in the hall configuration of fig .",
    "[ sc ] . specifically , we assume a uniform electric field @xmath24 parallel to the @xmath22 axis , with a reflecting wall at some negative @xmath25 blocking any transverse charge currents .",
    "the two - dimensional electron gas is translationally invariant along the @xmath22 axis , apart from the disorder potential , but the system parameters depend explicitly on @xmath25 .",
    "we assume that the rashba parameter @xmath0 has different constant values @xmath26 and @xmath27 for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , with a `` transition region '' @xmath30 . for reasons that will become clear later",
    ", we choose @xmath31 to be long on the scale of the mean - free path @xmath32 ( @xmath33 is the fermi velocity ) , but short on the scale of the dyakonov - perel spin - diffusion length @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , so that the spins do not relax while traversing the transition region .",
    "note that by definition , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the diffusion constant and @xmath39 a characteristic spin - relaxation time .",
    "a geometry of this type can be produced by a charged gate covering one half of the 2d system , say the region @xmath28 , in which case the transition length @xmath31 will be determined by the setback distance of the gate .",
    "in such a system , not only @xmath0 , but also the potential @xmath19 , the electron density @xmath40 , and the electron mobility @xmath41 will generally depend on @xmath25 .",

    "we point out that if the term proportional to the electric field in eq .",
    "( [ dys ] ) is disregarded@xcite ( which could physically be justified , e.g. , when the nonequilibrium spin density is induced optically at the edge in the absence of electric field ) , then these bc would in general describe interconversion of the @xmath25 and @xmath47 components of the spin density , which decays into the bulk on the scale of @xmath1 according to the diffusion equation ( [ de ] ) .",
    "this , however , gives a wrong result for the spin density generated by an electric field , as was previously noted in the case of a reflecting hall - bar edge by bleibaum,@xcite who obtained the same bc as eq .",
    "( [ dys ] ) , in that case , using a very different method , and also previously postulated by malshukov  _ _ et al.__@xcite finally , we note that from the structure of eq .",
    "( [ dys ] ) , it should be clear why we calculated densities to linear order in @xmath0 while gradients to quadratic order : the latter are governed by the spin precession in the rashba field which is linear in @xmath0 and the spin - generation term due to the electric field which is quadratic in @xmath0 . the second - order in @xmath0 bc for the normal components of the density gradients",
    "thus correspond to the first - order in @xmath0 solution of the spin - diffusion equation .",
    "in this section , we offer a simple physical explanation for the spin - density jump across the interface , which will also allow us to extend our findings to more general boundary configurations . because there is no net drift velocity in the @xmath25 direction , the term proportional to @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ hsoxy ] ) has much less effect than the term proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "the primary role of @xmath20 is to cause relaxation of @xmath112 , which takes place only on the very long time scale @xmath39 or the corresponding length scale @xmath1 . in order to understand variations on the much shorter length scale @xmath31",
    ", we may therefore set @xmath117 in @xmath118 .",
    "then , @xmath112 is conserved and @xmath119 is equivalent to a vector potential in the @xmath22 direction , @xmath120 for electrons with @xmath121 , in addition to a potential independent of @xmath122 , which is @xmath123 .",
    "thus , electrons with @xmath121 feel an effective orbital magnetic field in the @xmath47 direction , given by @xmath124 due to the hall effect in @xmath125 , an electric field in the @xmath22 direction leads to a chemical potential drop in the @xmath25 direction , which has opposite sign for the two spin states , leading to a difference of populations , and hence a jump in @xmath112 , across the interval @xmath30",
    ". the chemical potential jump may be calculated from the standard drude formula for the hall resistance .",
    "multiplying this by the density of states @xmath126 , we find from eq .",
    "( [ bz ] ) , @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the transport scattering time at position @xmath129 . in the case where @xmath130 is independent of @xmath25 , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ syy ] ) for @xmath29 is just @xmath131 , which is precisely the difference in the bulk polarizations in the two media , far from the boundary between them .",
    "the solution of the coupled spin - diffusion equation ( [ de ] ) is then simple : the polarization @xmath112 has one constant value in the region @xmath28 and another in the region @xmath29 , with an effective discontinuity at @xmath132 .",
    "there are no gradients of @xmath112 on the scale of the spin - diffusion length on either side of the boundary , and hence the diffusion equation leads to no polarization out of the plane .",
    "this is true , in principle , even if there is a difference in the electron density on the two sides of the interface , provided that the electron mobility , and hence @xmath130 , is constant throughout .    in general , however , density differences caused by charging a gate over one half of the system will lead to variations in @xmath130 and hence a gradient of @xmath130 in the transition region @xmath30 .",

    "we find that @xmath136 in this case , which is true even when @xmath137 , in agreement with refs .   and .",
    "finally , we note that in the case where the electric field is normal to a transmitting boundary , there should be no discontinuity in the spin polarization across the interface .",
    "if @xmath0 had depended on @xmath22 rather than @xmath25 , in the discussion above , the vector potential @xmath138 would have been purely longitudinal , giving no physical effect .    in summary ,",
    "we have developed a method , starting from the quantum kinetic equation , for studying spin hall effects in a system with a position - dependent rashba coupling constant @xmath0 , in the  dirty limit \" @xmath139 .",
    "we considered systems where @xmath0 depends only on @xmath25 and changes discontinuously on the scale of the spin - diffusion length @xmath1 , from one constant value to another , with a uniform applied electric field @xmath111 in the @xmath22 direction , and we derived boundary conditions for the coupled spin and charge diffusion equations , which apply away from the discontinuity . in general , we find a discontinuity in the @xmath25 component of the spin density @xmath140 at the boundary . in the case where the transport scattering time @xmath130 is independent of position",
    ", this leads to values of @xmath141 away from the boundary that are the same as would occur for a uniform system with the local value of @xmath0 , namely , @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "thus , in contrast to ref .  , we find no lateral spin injection into a normal conductor and no out - of - plane spin density , when the electron mobility is uniform .",
    "the related spin hall current extraction proposal of ref",
    ".   can therefore only work under the assumption of an inhomogeneous mobility close to the interface .",
    "we also find @xmath136 at a _ reflecting _ boundary , in contrast to ref .  , but in agreement with refs .   and .",
