    "for cosmologists , the clustering property of matter is a gold mine .",
    "although we are at the beginning stage of the operation , we have already been rewarded dearly : combined with wmap @xcite , sdss data constrains cosmological parameters to reasonably high precision ( for example , the matter density of the universe @xmath6 and the amplitude of the matter perturbation @xmath7 to @xmath8 @xcite ) . @xcite and @xcite found direct evidence of the mysterious dark energy through isw effect using data from sdss . also using sdss data , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) feature is used to probe the expansion history of the universe and cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "weak lensing surveys @xcite made the first attempt to constrain the time evolution of dark energy ... moreover numerous ambitious future surveys of large scale structure are proposed , such as the dark energy survey ( des ) , panstarrs , supernova / acceleration probe and large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) . from these surveys ,",
    "we want to answer questions like : is our concordance cosmology model correct ? what is the nature of the mysterious dark matter and dark energy ?",
    "do we need to modify gravity theory ? is the universe flat or curved ?    on the other hand , we have tremendous success in theoretical modeling of structure formation in our universe . starting with a handful of cosmological parameters",
    ", we can compute the linear theory matter power spectrum with high accuracy ( e.g. ,   * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we measure the nonlinear matter or galaxy power spectrum from large - scale structure surveys .",
    "our understanding of the connection between linear and nonlinear power spectrum is improving rapidly along with our ability to simulate the complex processes involved .",
    "the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) features in the late time matter clustering , characterized by a single peak in the correlation function and oscillations in the matter power spectrum , are imprints of the acoustic oscillations in the early universe which produces the peaks and troughs in the cmb angular power spectrum @xcite .",
    "although the bao features in the matter power spectrum are much weaker compared to those of the cmb because the dominating dark matter did not participate in the acoustic oscillations , these features can be measured with high accuracy with sufficiently large surveys .",
    "indeed , the first detection was made in the sdss survey in 2005 @xcite .    with the large galaxy surveys proposed , e.g. des , panstarrs , snap , and lsst , bao is emerging as an important method to measure the expansion history of the universe and cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "the main theoretical uncertainties , including galaxy bias , nonlinear evolution and redshift space distortions , are investigated in detail by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nonlinear evolution smears bao peaks due to mode - mode coupling .",
    "this effect makes bao signal weaker and harder to detect .",
    "an even more worrying effect is that nonlinear evolution could potentially shift the peaks which would bias the distance measurement from which the cosmological parameters are inferred .",
    "@xcite made an order of magnitude estimation of the amount of shift of bao peaks due to nonlinear evolution .",
    "they use spherical collapse model to estimate how much the overdensity within @xmath9 has grown if the center were over - dense ; and the change in radius is a third of that in the over density .",
    "their conclusion is that the change in scale is on the order of @xmath10 . in this work ,",
    "we use n - body simulations to test how much the peaks are shifted due to nonlinear evolution .      calibrated by simulations , fitting formulas of the nonlinear power spectrum",
    "have been developed @xcite .",
    "their precisions , on the order of @xmath11 , are sufficient for most of the current applications .",
    "future surveys would have statistical uncertainties so low that fitting formulas with improved accuracy are highly desired @xcite . as a step toward fulfilling this goal , we test the assumptions that go into the afore mentioned fitting formulas and propose the necessary ingredients to build a more accurate one . first ,",
    "let us briefly review the existing fitting formulas .    in a series of papers @xcite , the first fitting formula of the nonlinear power spectrum",
    "is worked out .",
    "the foundation of the fitting formula is the so called hklm relation which has two parts .",
    "the first part is to connect the nonlinear scale , @xmath12 , to the linear scale , @xmath13 , by volume - averaged correlation function @xmath14 , @xmath15^{1/3 } r_{nl } \\,.\\ ] ] the reasoning behind this is pair conservation @xcite . the second part of the hklm procedure is to conjecture that the nonlinear correlation function is a universal function of the linear one , @xmath16 \\,.\\ ] ] if one assumes that @xmath14 is equivalent to matter power spectrum at an effective wavenumber @xmath17 , then we have the power spectrum version of the hklm relation , @xmath18^{1/3 } k_{nl } \\,,\\ ] ] @xmath19 \\,.\\ ] ] it is commonly referred to as peacock & dodds fitting formula and @xmath20 is calibrated using n - body simulation assuming @xmath4cdm cosmology .",
    "another approach of calculating the nonlinear power spectrum is to use the halo model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , which splits up the contribution to the power spectrum into one halo and two halo terms , @xmath21 the one halo term @xmath22 is the contribution from two particles that reside in the same halo , @xmath23 and the two halo term is the contribution from two particles that belong to two different halos , @xmath24 ^ 2 p_{l}(k ) \\ , .",
    "\\label{eqn : p2h}\\ ] ] here @xmath25 is the mass of the halo , @xmath26 is the mean density of the universe , and @xmath27 is the fourier transform of the profile of a halo ( nfw profile * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) with mass @xmath25 , @xmath28 is the halo mass function which has the following form @xcite , @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the rms of the linear density field smoothed by a spherical top - hat filter @xmath32 , @xmath33 note that adding a sharp spike in the matter power spectrum would only modify @xmath34 below a mass threshold which is determined by the location of the spike . the modification to the mass function @xmath28 would also only occur below the same mass threshold",
    ". this could be easily shown by adding a @xmath35-function to @xmath36 in equation[eqn : sigmam ] .",
    "finally , based on a fusion of the halo model and an hklm scaling , @xcite provided an empirical fitting formula with improved performance ( rms error better than @xmath37 is claimed ) . in detail , they replaced the two halo term with a @xcite type fitting form with an exponential cut off at nonlinear @xmath17 to deal with translinear regime better ; and a fitting form to the one halo term .",
    "again , the fitting forms are calibrated using @xmath4cdm simulation .    to summarize , fitting formulas of the nonlinear matter power spectrum",
    "have been developed for @xmath4cdm cosmology with precisions on the order of @xmath11 .",
    "the foundations for these fitting formulas are the hklm scaling relation and halo model .",
    "a less obvious assumption behind all these fitting formulas is that the nonlinear power spectrum is determined by the linear power spectrum at the same epoch , i.e. the history of the linear power spectrum does not affect the nonlinear one .    in order to achieve the @xmath38 accuracy required by future surveys @xcite , and with more general parametrization of dark energy models , what approach shall we take to build new fitting formula of the nonlinear power spectrum ? to address the issue we will test the assumptions that go into the existing fitting formulas using carefully constructed numerical experiments . in the end",
    "we will decide which assumptions should be abandoned , kept , and further included .",
    "although all the existing fitting formulas are calibrated for @xmath4cdm cosmology , it has been a common practice to apply them to dark energy models in general .",
    "we will quantify how well this procedure works .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly introduce the pm simulations .",
    "we demonstrate the behavior of the peak in the initial power spectrum in section 3 , and discuss what we could learn from it .",
    "we test basic building blocks of the fitting formulas in section 4 . in section 5",
    "we evaluate the performance of the fitting formulas when applied to general dark energy models .",

    "there are effects other than nonlinear collapse could shift the bao peaks .",
    "the experiment above is dark matter simulation , but the actual tracer of bao peaks are galaxies which we know is biased tracer of dark matter .",
    "if galaxy bias is scale dependent , it could potentially shift the peaks . as shown in @xcite , and @xcite , this is indeed the case and the scale dependency should be carefully calibrated .",
    "another worry is that bao peaks sit on top of the smooth underline power spectrum whose slope changes due to nonlinear evolution might shift the peaks . as pointed out in @xcite that",
    "this need not be the case .",
    "the argument is that one can easily make a template of the smooth underline power spectrum against which to achieve an unbiased measurement .      to see the effects of the peak on nonlinear power spectrum ,",
    "we compare the nonlinear power spectra evolved from initial power spectra with and without artificial peak .",
    "the smooth part of these initial power spectra are set to have the same amplitude .",
    "note that this is different from requiring the same @xmath7 which would allocate more power to the no peak case on scales outside the peak which would certainly make things more complicated and less clean .",

    "the amount of boost in power shows no scale dependency .",
    "the mapping between linear and nonlinear scale proposed by @xcite and adopted by @xcite would have predicted that the peak being mapped to a nonlinear scale @xmath127 which increases as the nonlinear power grows .",
    "we do not see that kind of mapping here . on the other hand ,",
    "the result is similar to what halo model s approach would predict . in the halo model , the one halo term ( see equation[eqn : p1h ] )",
    "is determined by the halo profile and the halo mass function @xmath28 .",
    "the halo profile has nothing to do with whether there is a peak in the matter power spectrum or not .",
    "an extra peak in the linear power spectrum would increase the halo mass function below certain mass threshold determined by the position of the peak . as a result",
    ", the nonlinear power are boosted on small scales which is close to what we observe in this test . in detail",
    ", it does not agree with halo model s prediction perfectly .",
    "as shown in figure[fig : halopeak ] , halo model predicts that the fractional boost in power due to the existence of a peak has some weak scale dependence which is slightly different from what we see in the simulation . since the addition of a spike in the power spectrum only changes the mass function at the low mass end where @xmath27 is scale independent at @xmath128 a few tenths @xmath129 , the one halo term acts like a shot noise term .",
    "the fractional difference of the power spectra is scale dependent due to the addition of this short noise like term to the power spectrum .",
    "we do not yet understand what accounts for this difference between halo model and the simulation .",
    "existing fitting formulas of matter power spectrum , @xcite , @xcite or a simple halo model , have the following assumption : the nonlinear power spectrum does not depend on the time evolution ( history ) of the linear power spectrum ; it is determined by the linear power spectrum at the same epoch .    there is a weaker version of the assumption , which states that the linear power spectrum plus its time evolution determine the nonlinear power spectrum .",
    "a halo model incorporating merger history is a good example of building fitting formula of nonlinear matter power spectrum under this weaker assumption .    in this section ,",
    "we test both versions of the above assumption using carefully chosen dark energy models .",

    "we apply singular value decomposition ( svd ) to the response matrix @xmath140 and select the eigenvectors that have small eigenvalues .",
    "these eigenvectors correspond to the combinations of @xmath155 to which @xmath156 has the least response . among the selected modes we pick the ones that involve variations of @xmath131 at low redshift where the effect of dark energy dominates .",
    "only one mode passed the selection criteria and is shown in figure[fig : wsamegz0 ] as model - iii .",

    "so the nonlinear power spectrum does care about the time evolution of the linear power spectrum , contrary to what existing fitting formulas assume .",
    "our interpretation is the following .",
    "the difference in the linear power spectrum during the past causes some differences in the nonlinear power spectrum which would stay there unless some rather delicate adjustments of the history of the linear power spectrum is done to offset the effect .",
    "an arbitrary history of the linear power spectrum does not have the ability to undo the difference in the nonlinear power spectrum .",
    "one possibility is that different linear growth histories would produce different halo merger histories on which the halo concentration depends @xcite .",
    "so the nonlinear power spectrum which mainly comes from the one halo term would be different .",
    "it is hard to imagine that simply matching the linear growth at @xmath76 would erase the difference .",
    "so in general the difference would be there as shown in our test case .",
    "the effect of linear growth history on nonlinear power spectrum is by no means limited to the @xmath158 level shown in our test case .",
    "the nonsmooth nature of @xmath40 also would not make our argument any weaker . by a little bit of more work ,",
    "we come up with another example that has much smoother @xmath40 curve ( figure[fig : wsamegz0 ] model - ii ) and matching linear growth at @xmath76 but maximum difference of @xmath159 in the past ( figure[fig : gdiffhistory ] dash line ) . as shown in figure[fig : pkgdiffhistorylbox100 ] ( dash line ) , the resulting nonlinear power spectra have maximum difference at @xmath160 level . from these examples",
    ", we see that the difference of the nonlinear power spectrum due to different linear growth history is at the level of the maximum deviation of the corresponding linear power spectra in the past .",
    "our test of the weaker assumption validates it as shown in figure[fig : pkgsamehistory ] .",
    "the nonlinear power spectra of @xmath149 model and the constructed dark energy model - iii ( figure[fig : wsamegz0 ] ) are consistent with being essentially the same given the small difference of the linear power spectra .",
    "this is not a proof that the history of the linear power spectrum fully determines the nonlinear power spectrum , but it hints that it is possibly the case . note that although there is basically no hope of distinguishing the two apparently very different dark energy models using their growth functions , their expansion histories differ by @xmath157 ( see figure[fig : hz ] ) which is close to the level that bao could potentially have some handle on .",
    "with the ambitious observational efforts focused on measuring the equation of state of dark energy to high precision ( des , snap , lsst , panstarrs ) , theoretical parameter forecasts will need to be done more carefully than before .",
    "in particular , we have to have a better understanding of the nonlinear power spectrum which is very important for cosmic shear and any other probes that utilize the information of growth of density perturbations .",
    "since numerical simulations are too expensive to run for every application , fitting formulas of the matter power spectrum are widely used .",
    "the ones provided by @xcite and @xcite are calibrated using @xmath4cdm models .",
    "@xcite provided a correction factor to the above mentioned fitting formulas for cosmology with constant @xmath141 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "for two parameter dark energy models parameterized by @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xcite gives a simple procedure to calculate the nonlinear matter power spectrum with a few percent accuracy . while the method provided by @xcite has not yet been widely adopted , a common practice is to apply @xcite and @xcite fitting formulas regardless of the dark energy models . in this work",
    "we evaluate how well this common practice works .",
    "two things could go wrong if we used an inaccurate fitting formula .",
    "one is that the fitting formula predicts the wrong amplitude of the matter power spectrum .",
    "this is the part we study in this work .",
    "another effect of incorrect fitting formula is that the predicted model parameter degeneracy directions and/or extent of the directions are off .",
    "although not covered in this study , the latter effect is very important when the parameters are highly degenerate . during our study of the effect of photo - z on weak lensing tomography @xcite",
    ", we noticed that with no tomography binning the extent of the degeneracy among dark energy parameters could differ by a factor of 4 depending on whether the fitting forms of @xcite or halo model is used to calculate the matter power spectrum .",
    "for this study we further restrict ourself to two parameter dark energy models which are parametrized by @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the quantity we use to evaluate the performance of the fitting formulas applied to @xmath161 dark energy models is , @xmath162 which is the fractional difference of the matter power spectrum between @xmath3 model , @xmath163 , and the @xmath4cdm model , @xmath164 .",

    "again , just to remind ourself that we are only considering the effect of the amplitude of the power spectrum but not that of the shape of the power spectrum which is closely tied to the degeneracy direction of the model parameters .",
    "the most surprising result we find is that the fractional differences in @xmath165 from @xcite fitting formula are independent of @xmath3 , as shown in figure[fig : qfactz0 ] . to turn this fact into a fitting formula of the matter power spectrum for @xmath3 models , the time evolution of this potential correction factor to @xcite fitting formula",
    "should also be independent of @xmath3 .",
    "figure[fig : qfactz0.62 ] shows this correction factor at @xmath178 .",
    "we see that the peak of the correction shifts to smaller scale ( higher @xmath17 ) as one goes to higher redshift and , amazingly , it shows no dependency on @xmath3 .",
    "although such regular behavior seems always have a good reason behind it , at the moment , we do not have a physical explanation .",

    "[ fig : qfactz0.62],width=326 ]    it is very tempting to use such a fact to come up with a correction factor to the fitting formula of @xcite .",
    "the hump at the nonlinear scale in figure[fig : qfactz0 ] and the ones at high redshift can be fit very well using a gaussian in @xmath17 space . however , as we have pointed out throughout this work , the physical arguments supporting peacock & dodds fitting formula do not seem to hold : the linear and nonlinear scale mapping does not hold ; the assumption that the history of the linear growth does not affect the nonlinear power spectrum is also being shown to be incorrect . adding more corrections to peacock & dodds fitting formula would only turn it into another `` theory of epicycles '' .",
