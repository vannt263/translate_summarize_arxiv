    "the open archives initiative ( oai ) was born from the 1999 santa fe universal preprint service meeting   and the santa fe convention  , with the intention of improving scholarly communication through improved interoperability between eprint archives . during the first year of discussion and development",
    "the scope of the oai was extended and the associated protocol generalized to be more widely applicable  .",
    "the current , application - neutral , open archives initiative protocol for metadata harvesting ( oai - pmh )   is the result of almost three years of experimentation and development .",
    "while the focus of the oai has broadened to include more than just eprints , the original participants have continued to play active roles in the development of the oai .",
    "one result is that there are a growing number of eprint archives for which metadata is available via the oai - pmh .",
    "a recent study   of the scholarly information environment reported that 87% of respondents ( faculty , graduate and undergraduate students ) use online methods to find print materials for research ( spread between online databases , library finding aids , search engines , subject directories and other forms ) .",
    "this suggests that the inclusion of oai - pmh harvested metadata for eprints in library finding aids , search engines and subject directories would increase the impact of eprints  with the added advantage for users that they can also access the material online .",
    "the same study reported that the 74% of respondents said that online access was their preferred access method for electronic journal articles .",
    "( as opposed to using a library terminal , or personal holdings . )",
    "different writers use the terms _ eprint _ in more or less general senses . some imply a very general meaning , for example : `` an eprint archive is a collection of digital documents ''  @xcite , which would include a private digital library or a proprietary electronic journal with restricted access .",
    "others restrict the term to author - self archived electronic documents , and yet others apply the term only to author - self archived pre - prints .",
    "the term was originally used in the announcement of `` algebraic geometry e - prints '' at duke .",
    "paul ginsparg recounts `` ... originally ` e - print ' was a pun on preprint , originally appeared on a page created by dave morrison at duke in feb 1992 for ` algebraic geometry e - prints ' , the second archive based on my original hep - th csh scripts .",
    "( on that page , dave credited his colleague greg lawler with coining the word . ) the word ` e - print ' then quickly devolved to meaninglessness but more recently has been rehabilitated to mean an article either in draft or final form _ self - archived _ by the author . ''",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this paper i use a definition similar to that given by pinfield _",
    "et al _  .",
    "i use the term _ eprint _ to group together many forms of scholarly literature for which there is open access to the full - content via the internet .",
    "eprints may include : journal articles , pre - prints , technical reports , books , theses and dissertations .",
    "eprints may or may not be refereed .",
    "the importance of eprints varies widely over different subject areas .",
    "eprints have been most successful in high - energy physics where they are used as a dissemination mechanism that shortcuts the delays and access - restrictions associated with conventional journals .",
    "this success is usually attributed to the pre - existing culture of sharing pre - prints  .",
    "kling and mckim   point out that other disciplines use electronic media in different ways and for different parts of the scientific communication process .",
    "they suggest that many of the differences between disciplines will be `` durable features of the scholarly landscape '' .",
    "we should thus avoid the temptation to imagine that simply extending the model of physicists use of eprints to other disciplines will succeed .",
    "however , the oai framework is not dependent on one model of electronic media use and can provide a discipline independent infrastructure for metadata exchange while also supporting the exchange of discipline specific metadata .",
    "publication and review are not the same thing in general , and one does not necessarily imply the other . to publish means simply `` to make generally known '' or `` to disseminate to the public ''  @xcite .",
    "if we consider the four components of scholarly communication described by roosendaal and guerts    registration , certification , awareness and archiving  registration is the component satisfied by publication , and certification may be satisfied by peer - review or some other process ( perhaps more than one ) .",
    "the arxiv eprint archive  @xcite provides almost no certification and yet has transformed scholarly communication in some areas of physics .",
    "arxiv does provide the registration , awareness and , to some extent , the archiving components of scholarly communication .",
    "however , even those physicists that rely on arxiv for dissemination of their research usually also rely on conventional journals to provide the certification ( by peer - review ) necessary to support career advancement and funding applications .",
    "theses and dissertations are different from typical research articles in that they are subject to a certification process that is usually quite separate from publication and any associated revenue stream .",
    "this makes theses and dissertations one form of scholarly communication that already appear as eprints over a much broader range of subjects than are covered by the few successful discipline - based eprint repositories .",
    "the meaning of the certification of a theses or dissertation depends strongly on the reputation of the degree awarding institution so any metadata which will allow a user to assess the certification should include this information .",
    "the draft metadata format proposed by the networked digital library of theses and dissertations ( ndltd )   includes specific fields to describe the name , level , discipline and grantor of the degree .",
    "one hurdle for more widespread acceptance of eprints is users skepticism about the authenticity and credibility of information obtained from the internet .",
    "a recent digital library federation ( dlf ) commissioned study   reported that more than half of respondents say they verify the accuracy of information they obtain from the internet .",
    "the same report shows a wide spectrum of methods used to determine the authoritativeness of information obtained from the internet : 19% only reference known sources , 14% check with alternative sources , 13% trust the author , 9% trust the sponsoring organization or publisher , 9% trust the web site , 7% only reference academic sources provided by an accredited institution .",
    "these figures suggest that the identity of an eprint repository and the authority associated with it will be important in determining acceptance .",
    "there already exists a metadata format specifically for including `` branding '' information with oai - pmh records  .",
    "the branding information includes an icon and a link to be associated with the icon ( typically the home page of the originating repository ) .",
    "the linked icon can be displayed by service providers which use harvested metadata .",
    "greater adoption of this standard may help support the projection of repository identities and associated authority assumptions in oai based services .",
    "this may be particularly effective for institutional repositories where the institution carries significant authority .",
    "the recent sparc white paper on institutional repositories   presents a compelling case for institutional repositories , a type of eprint archive , as part of an evolving scholarly publishing system .",
    "interoperability as provided by the existing oai infrastructure is cited as an essential infrastructure component required for the effective use of such repositories .",
    "perhaps the most prominent system to encourage the creation of eprint repositories is the eprints software  @xcite , the goal of which is to promote author self - archiving and institutional archives .",
    "exchange of metadata via the oai - pmh is a key element of the eprints software and has been built into the system since its first version . at the very least , by sharing metadata , individual repositories will be included in the ` union catalogs ' upon which oai search and alerting services are based . in this way",
    ", institutional repositories keep the publication and preservation functions with the institution , which has motivations to support these activities , while still allowing the eprints to be part of a global collection .",
    "the development of additional oai - based services can add value to the entire collection or to selected segments .",
    "table  [ oaidptable ] shows that over half of the registered oai data providers ( repositories ) contain metadata about eprints .",
    "determination of whether a repository contains metadata about eprints was made based on the repository name , description and response to the oai - pmh identify verb .",
    "only repositories registered with the oai website were included .",
    "some repositories are registered twice because they support both versions 1.1 and  2.0 of the oai - pmh .",
    "these duplicate entries and `` test servers '' were excluded from the percentages calculated .",
    ".[oaidptable ] survey of registered oai data providers to estimate number that contain metadata about eprints ( october 2002 ) [ cols=\"<,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      @xmath0 harvests from sources where full content is available digitally : the resources `` have a corresponding web - based digital representation ( e.g. , this would not include the metadata records for slides when the slides can not be accessed through the web ) . ''",
    "+ @xmath1 limited to the physics section of arxiv ( contains most of the submissions in arxiv ) .",
    "harvests full - content outside of oai - pmh .",
    "+ @xmath2 arxiv , jhep ( not currently a registered oai data provider ) , biomed central , m2db ( a local multi - media database ) .",
    "+ @xmath3 not yet operational , just a few records harvested . + @xmath4 test service , harvests full - content pdf from arxiv , biomed central and cogprints outside of the oai - pmh for reference extraction .",
    "+ @xmath5 harvests from institutional cs technical - report repositories and includes the locally stored , historical ncstrl collection .",
    "at present there are just a few significant eprint archives and they tend to be discipline based .",
    "this means that researchers in a particular field can know about the one or two archives appropriate to their interests , and services using metadata from eprint archives can manually select appropriate archives to harvest from . if eprint archives become more numerous then these conditions will no longer hold .    the oai and , more recently , the budapest open access initiative   has spurred growth in the number of institutional archives .",
    "presumably some institutional archives will combine electronic theses and dissertations with research articles .",
    "there are currently more electronic theses and dissertations archives than general institutional archives registered as oai data providers .",
    "this is perhaps to be expected because efforts to encourage the use of electronic theses and dissertations have been going for longer .",
    "these efforts also have the advantage that universities usually have considerably more control over students than over faculty , some even mandate the electronic submission of theses and dissertations .",
    "it is likely that universities will have to put significant effort into promoting general institutional archives and assisting faculty in using them .",
    "the oai - pmh is designed to support automation and this feature will become more important as the number of oai data providers increases . in the next few sections i highlight a few areas where the oai metadata harvesting infrastructure may improve the utility of eprints and eprint archives .",
    "there are already several search engines based all or in - part on oai harvested metadata .",
    "some of these services also include local or web data and clearly one can see adding appropriate oai metadata to a local search engine as a way of adding value to the local search and helping to make that a good starting point for information discovery .",
    "metadata based search engines are good at answering certain types of question which make use of the structure of the metadata .",
    "trivial examples are `` find documents authored by fred bloggs '' ( notwithstanding problems created by possible lack of name - authority information to associate articles with author listed as `` f bloggs '' and to separate from articles authored by some other fred bloggs ) , or `` find documents that cite a '' ( given appropriate citation metadata ) .",
    "however , questions such as `` find documents similar to document x '' are unlikely to be answered well by query engines which do not have access to the full content or more complete summary information .",
    "the oai has steered away from specifying facilities for the exchange of full content for various reasons , including : appropriate use and rights issues , concerns about resource and bandwidth use , and the desire to create a strong base - line interoperability framework with as many players as possible .",
    "one way to improve discovery tools without going as far as sharing full content is to include summary metadata .",
    "research articles in many fields typically include author - created abstracts , in other cases it may be appropriate to augment metadata with automatically generated summaries as surrogates for the full content .",
    "resources from different sources and in different subject areas are often classified according to different classification schemes . within an interoperable framework",
    "there will be the need to provide classifications across disparate collections and to group or classify documents according to criteria that were not imagined by the creators of the source repositories . in most cases",
    "it will not be feasible to use human catalogers .    in recent years",
    "there have been significant advances in systems automatic classification and clustering of text - documents  .",
    "while these systems can not yet compete with well - trained human catalogers , they do produce useful classifications which can be inexpensively applied to large collections .",
    "a large class of automated classifiers and clustering algorithms are based on analysis of word frequencies in the abstracts or full texts of documents .",
    "an obvious way to permit such analysis is to allow full content to be harvested and indexed but this has at least two potential problems : 1 ) the content may be prohibitively large and harvesting it may place excessive burdens on the resources of data providers , and 2 ) if full content is harvested , the harvester must understand every format available to be able to extract the text .",
    "generation of summaries or text - only versions of the content ( without markup ) may prove an effective alternative which can both reduce bandwidth requirements and use local knowledge of content and formats to do these extraction jobs well .",
    "citebase  @xcite is an impressive demonstration of a reference and citation linking service built with automatically extracted reference data from eprints .",
    "while this data can be obtained only from the full content ( pdf in the case of citebase ) of articles , the reference data may then be shared .",
    "all reference and citation data extracted by citebase is available via the oai - pmh , it may be harvested and used by other services .",
    "citebase also provides a search service which can rank results by an impact measure based on citations and web usage data .",
    "there is the exciting potential to realize a globally connected web of eprints based on link extraction and identifier resolution .",
    "metadata exchanged via oai - pmh will be one component of such a web and may be combined with context - sensitive linking services based on the openurl standard  .",
    "rights management is important both to commercial entities who wish to protect their resources , and also to providers of eprints and other open - access content who may still be wish to describe appropriate uses or restrictions on use .",
    "project romeo  @xcite is specifically investigating the rights issues surrounding open - access scholarly literature in the context of the oai .",
    "current eprint repositories often include free - text rights statements regarding the use of their metadata and content .",
    "the creation of tools which understand rights information requires the development of machine readable rights metadata . creation and inclusion of rights metadata was been suggested several times during the development but rejected as outside the scope of the core protocol and likely to be difficult or impossible given the broad scope of oai .",
    "this task may be tractable within the limited scope of the eprints community .",
    "the preservation of paper copies of journals and other scholarly works has traditionally been a role of university and national libraries .",
    "the situation is much less clear with commercial electronic journals and even worse for eprints .",
    "empirical studies of the persistence of objects in digital libraries   and of web references in the scientific literature   have reported losses of @xmath6% .",
    "such losses would clearly be unacceptable in a traditional library .",
    "these studies remind us that many valuable digital resources , including scholarly works , are not adequately provided with preservation strategies .",
    "the lockss   system illustrates one suggested approach for the preservation of web published material . using lockss",
    ", libraries act to preserve material they subscribe to by running persistent caches . in the event that material is not available from the publisher , multiple copies will remain in these persistent caches . in the subscription world",
    "there is a need for agreements between publishes and libraries to grant the libraries the right to make and use cached copies in this way . with open - access material ,",
    "including eprints , there need not be agreements between individual data providers and agents preserving the content provided there is some machine readable information that says such caching is acceptable . in this way",
    ", a portal could automatically cache all material that its users access and the oai - pmh would be one way to exchange additional metadata to support this .",
    "indeed , such a system must be automatic if it is to work with perhaps thousands of individual repositories .",
    "the open archival information system ( oais )   provides a comprehensive preservation metadata framework that is likely to be too heavyweight to be implemented by eprint repositories in the near future .",
    "however , various elements described in this framework could be used to fulfill specific preservation requirements .",
    "for example , an md5 checksum   might be included in the metadata for a resource to allow the resource s validity to be checked ( part of the fixity requirement in oais ) .",
    "there are an increasing number of eprint repositories , both discipline based and institutional .",
    "the open archives initiative ( oai ) is a key infrastructure component that avoids individual repositories becoming isolated islands of information , by supporting the creation user services as a separate layer .",
    "a number of services already provide cross - repository searching and other facilities based on oai harvested metadata .",
    "there is considerable potential to add value to eprint repositories with new services and facilities .",
    "some of these services will require additional metadata , and this metadata must be machine - readable so that it can used automatically . as the number of oai repositories and services increases , it will become increasingly important that services do not need to create and implement a custom solution for each repository they cover .",
    "there is the realizable potential to create a global network of interoperating eprint archives with a rich set of discovery , classification and linking services based on the oai framework .",
    "this work is supported by the u.s . national science foundation under agreement number 0132355 and grant number iis-9817416 .",
