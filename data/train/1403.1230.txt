    "stellar collapse liberates gravitational energy of order @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "most ( @xmath6 ) of that energy is emitted in neutrinos , and the remainder ( @xmath7 ) powers a core - collapse supernova ( ccsn ) explosion .",
    "however , a small fraction of ccsne are hyper - energetic ( @xmath8 ) and involve relativistic outflows ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these _ hypernovae _ come from stripped - envelope progenitors and are classified as type ic - bl ( h / he deficient , broad spectral lines ) .",

    "@xcite , in which neutrinos emitted from the collapsed core deposit energy behind the stalled shock , eventually driving it outward ( e.g. , @xcite ) . however , the neutrino mechanism appears to lack the efficiency needed to drive hyperenergetic explosions .",
    "one possible alternative is the _ magnetorotational _ mechanism ( e.g. @xcite ) . in its canonical form , rapid rotation of the collapsed core ( period @xmath10 , spin energy @xmath11 ) and magnetar - strength magnetic field with",
    "a dominant toroidal component drive a strong bipolar jet - like explosion that could result in a hypernova ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetorotational mechanism requires rapid precollapse rotation ( @xmath12 ; @xcite ) and an efficient process to rapidly amplify the likely weak seed magnetic field of the progenitor .",
    "the _ magnetorotational instability _",
    "( mri ,  @xcite ) is one possibility .",
    "the mri operates on the free energy of differential rotation and , in combination with dynamo action , has been hypothesized to provide the necessary global field strength on an essentially dynamical timescale @xcite .",
    "the wavelength of the fastest growing mri mode in a postbounce ccsn core is much smaller than what can currently be resolved in global multi - dimensional ccsn simulations . under the assumption that mri and dynamo operate as envisioned ,",
    "a common approach is to start with a likely unphysically strong precollapse field of @xmath13 . during collapse and the early postbounce evolution , this field",
    "is amplified by flux compression and rotational winding to dynamically important field strength of @xmath14 @xcite . in this way ,",
    "a number of recent two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations have found robust and strong jet - driven explosions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "only a handful of 3d studies have been carried out with varying degrees of microphysical realism ( @xcite ) and none have compared 2d and 3d dynamics directly .    in this _ letter _ , we present new full 3d dynamical - spacetime general - relativistic mhd ( grmhd ) simulations of rapidly rotating magnetized ccsne .",
    "these are the first to employ a microphysical finite - temperature equation of state , a realistic progenitor model , and an approximate neutrino treatment for collapse and postbounce evolution .",
    "we carry out simulations in full unconstrained 3d and compare with simulations starting from identical initial conditions , but constrained to 2d .",
    "our results for a model with initial poloidal @xmath15-field of @xmath16 indicate that 2d and 3d magnetorotational ccsne are fundamentally different . in 2d , a strong jet - driven explosion obtains , while in unconstrained 3d , the developing jet is destroyed by nonaxisymmetric dynamics , caused most likely by an @xmath0 mhd kink instability .",
    "the subsequent ccsn evolution leads to two large asymmetric shocked lobes at high latitudes .",
    "highly - magnetized tubes tangle , twist , and drive the global shock front steadily , but not dynamically outward .",
    "a runaway explosion does not occur during the @xmath2@xmath1 of postbounce time covered by our full 3d simulation .",
    "we employ ideal grmhd with adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) and spacetime evolution provided by the open - source ` einsteintoolkit `  @xcite .",
    "grmhd is implemented in a finite - volume fashion with weno5 reconstruction  @xcite and the hlle riemann solver @xcite and constrained transport @xcite for maintaining @xmath17 .",
    "we employ the @xmath18 variant of the equation of state of @xcite and the neutrino leakage / heating approximations described in @xcite and @xcite . at the precollapse stage , we cover the inner @xmath2@xmath19 of the star with four amr levels and add five more during collapse .",
    "after bounce , the protoneutron star is covered with a resolution of @xmath2@xmath20 and amr is set up to always cover the shocked region with at least @xmath21 linear resolution .",
    "we draw the @xmath22-@xmath23 ( at zero - age - main - sequence ) presupernova model e25 from @xcite and set up axisymmetric precollapse rotation using the rotation law of @xcite ( see their eq .",

    "the nearly prompt magnetorotational explosion of the octant - symmetry run _ fails _ in full 3d .",

    "later , highly - magnetized ( @xmath56 ) funnels of high - entropy material protrude from polar regions of the core and secularly push out the shock into two dramatic tilted lobes . at the end of our simulation ( @xmath2@xmath1 after bounce )",
    "the lobes fill polar cones of @xmath2@xmath57 and are only gradually expanding as low-@xmath32 material is pushed out from below . accreting material is deflected by these lobes and pushed towards the equator where it accretes through the remainder of the initial nearly spherical shock .",
    "the results discussed in the above suggest that the full 3d run is subject to a spiral instability that grows from @xmath2@xmath36 @xmath0 seeds in the velocity field to non - linear scale within the first @xmath2@xmath33 after bounce .",
    "this instability quenches the jet .",
    "figure  [ fig : growthrate ] depicts the linear growth and non - linear saturation of the spiral instability at various locations along the spin axis outside the protoneutron star .    in the rotating ccsn context ,",
    "rotational shear instabilities in the protoneutron star ( e.g. , @xcite ) and a spiral standing accretion shock instability ( sasi ; e.g. , @xcite ) have been discussed to potentially arise already at early postbounce times .",
    "it is unlikely that either of these is excited in our simulations , since we choose to perturb a radially and vertically narrow region along the spin axis outside of the protoneutron star and far from the shock , within the region of the highest toroidal magnetic field strength .",
    "a spiral mhd instability may thus be the driving agent behind the strong asymmetry in our simulation .",
    "one possible such instability is the screw - pinch kink instability that has been studied in jets from active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the b - field near the spin axis in our simulation can be roughly approximated by a screw - pinch field configuration .",
    "this consists of a non - rotating plasma cylinder and a magnetic field of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is along the rotation axis , @xmath60 is in the toroidal direction , @xmath61 is a constant vertical component of the b - field , and @xmath62 is the radially - varying toroidal component of the b - field",
    ". we can express perturbations to the jet in the form of fluid displacements as a sum of basis elements of the form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is an integer , @xmath65 is the vertical wave number , and @xmath66 is the oscillation frequency of the mode .",
    "the kruskal - shafranov stability criterion states that a plasma cylinder confined to a finite radius @xmath67 ( as in a tokamak ) is unstable to kink ( @xmath68 ) modes if @xmath69 , where l is the length of the cylinder and the sign of @xmath64 is such that the mode s helicity is opposite to the field helix ( @xcite ) .",
    "unconfined screw - pinch structures with @xmath70 have been shown to be violently unstable to @xmath0 modes at short vertical wavelengths ( @xmath71 ) when @xmath72 and the plasma parameter is sufficiently large ( @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the local adiabatic index ) . under these conditions ( which are only approximately met in our simulation ) , the fastest growing unstable mode ( fgm )",
    "is amplified on a timescale comparable to the alfvn travel time around a toroidal loop @xcite .",
    "the expected @xmath0 growth timescale and vertical wavelength in the most unstable regions of the jet at @xmath2@xmath75 after bounce are @xmath76 where @xmath67 is the radius of the most unstable region .",
    "the growth time is much shorter than the time it would take for the jet to propagate through the shocked region .",
    "the effect of the kink instability can be most clearly seen in a displacement of the jet barycenter away from the rotation axis of the core .",
    "we measure the displacement of the jet in our full 3d run by computing the barycenter displacement ( planar `` center - of - mass '' displacement ; @xcite ) of the co - moving magnetic field strength @xmath40 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) in xy - slices at different heights @xmath41 along the rotation axis ( fig .  [",
    "fig : growthrate ] ) .",
    "@xmath40 probes the mhd effects in our simulations most directly , but other variable choices , e.g.  the specific entropy @xmath77 , exhibit similar behavior as flux freezing couples fluid properties to the magnetic field evolution .",
    "figure  [ fig : growthrate ] demonstrates that the jet experiences significant displacements from the rotation axis of the core in a spiraling motion with helicity opposite to that of the magnetic field ( indicated by the magenta colored arrow in fig .  [ fig : growthrate ] ) , and that the growth rate and dominant instability length scale roughly agree with those predicted by a kink unstable jet in our analysis .",
    "although the initial bipolar jet fails to promptly break out of the stalled shock , mhd becomes dominant tens of milliseconds later .",
    "starting around @xmath2@xmath78 after bounce , outflows of highly - magnetized material are continuously launched from the protoneutron star and propagate along the rotation axis of the core .",

    "[ fig : betavolren ] , we present volume renderings of specific entropy and plasma parameter @xmath32 at @xmath79 after bounce . only these volume renderings speak the full truth about how severely outflows driven by the core are deformed , sheared , and wound up as they propagate in the @xmath80-direction .",
    "the material that is expelled from the vicinity of the protoneutron star forms tube - like structures that are highly magnetized ( @xmath81 ) , underdense ( @xmath2@xmath36 the density of the surrounding fluid ) , and rise buoyantly .",
    "the overall structure of the shocked region evolves toward strongly prolate - shape with two , roughly @xmath57-filling tilted lobes at both poles ( cf",
    ".  figs .",
    "[ fig : octfullcmp ] , [ fig : beta ] , [ fig : betavolren ] ) .",
    "the lobes secularly expand to @xmath2@xmath3 during the simulated time , but their expansion never becomes dynamical .",
    "accreting material is funneled to equatorial regions where it continues to settle onto the protoneutron star .",
    "the @xmath15-field geometry in the later evolution corresponds to that of a tightly wound coil close to the protoneutron star , but the field lines open up in a spiraling fashion further out , yet still behind the shock .",
    "this is consistent with magnetized material moving away from the rotation axis as it propagates in the general @xmath80-direction . in 2d simulations , a confining magnetic - tower structure forms instead @xcite",
    "our results show that 3d magnetorotational core - collapse supernovae are fundamentally different from what has been anticipated on the basis of axisymmetric simulations @xcite . a jet that develops in 2d",
    "is disrupted and fizzles in 3d .",
    "we suggest that the instability driving this is most likely an mhd kink ( @xmath0 ) instability to which the toroidally - dominated postbounce magnetic - field configuration is prone . instead of an axially symmetric jet ,",
    "a completely new , previously unseen , wide double - lobed flow pattern develops , but we obtain no runaway explosion during the simulated time .",
    "the high precollapse field strength of @xmath16 yields @xmath2@xmath50 in toroidal field and @xmath82 within only @xmath2@xmath83 of bounce , creating conditions favorable for jet formation . yet , the growth time of the kink instability is shorter than the time it takes for the jet to develop . in a short test simulation with an even more unrealistic , ten times stronger initial field ,",
    "a successful jet is launched promptly after bounce ( consistent with @xcite ) , but subsequently experiences a spiral instability in its core .",
    "realistic precollapse iron cores are not expected to have magnetic fields in excess of @xmath2@xmath84 , which may be amplified to no more than @xmath2@xmath16 during collapse @xcite .",
    "the @xmath85 of large - scale toroidal field required to drive a magnetorotational jet must be built up after bounce .",
    "this will likely require tens to hundreds of dynamical times , even if the magnetorotational instability operates in conjunction with a dynamo .",
    "the results of the present and previous full 3d rotating ccsn simulations @xcite suggest that mhd and also a variety of nonaxisymmetric hydrodynamic instabilities will grow to non - linear regimes on _ shorter timescales _ , disrupting any possibly developing axial outflow .",
    "_ this is why we believe that the dynamics and flow structures seen in our full 3d simulation may be generic to the postbounce evolution of rapidly rotating magnetized core collapse that starts from realistic initial conditions_.    if the polar lobes eventually accelerate , the resulting explosion will be asymmetric , though probably less so than a jet - driven explosion .",
    "the lobes carry neutron rich ( @xmath86 ) material of moderate entropy ( @xmath87 ) , which could lead to interesting @xmath88-process yields , similar to what @xcite found for their prompt jet - driven explosion .",
    "even if the lobes continue to move outward , accretion in equatorial regions may continue , eventually ( after @xmath89 ) leading to the collapse of the protoneutron star and black hole formation . in this case",
    ", the engine supplying the lobes with low-@xmath32 plasma is shut off .",
    "unless their material has reached positive total energy , the lobes will fall back onto the black hole , which will subsequently hyperaccrete until material becomes centrifugally supported in an accretion disk .",
    "this would set the stage for a subsequent long grb and an associated type ic - bl ccsn that would be driven by a collapsar central engine @xcite rather than by a protomagnetar @xcite .",
    ".2 cm the results of the present study highlight the importance of studying magnetorotational ccsne in 3d .",
