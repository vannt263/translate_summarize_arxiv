    "the main result of these previous studies is that shape alignment is a robust measurement regardless of the methods and simulations . on the other hand ,",
    "the results for the angular momentum differ in the degree of the alignment .    in the same spirit of describing the place of galaxies within the cosmic web ,",
    "there has been a revival of surveys that measure the cosmic flow patterns in the local universe @xcite . assuming the linearity between the divergence of the cosmic flow velocity field and the local matter overdensity ( valid in the linear regime ) one could construct accurate maps of the matter density from peculiar velocities @xcite .",
    "from this perspective it is interesting to look at the expected alignment of the peculiar velocities .    in this paper",
    "we review most of the studies about shape and angular momentum alignment and offer our own study with complementary numerical techniques and simulations .",
    "we also present for the first time in the literature new results for the alignment of peculiar velocities with the large scale structure .",
    "the structure of this paper  is the following . in  [ sec : theory ] we present the theoretical antecedents for the alignment studies we present in this paper . in  [ sec : nbody ] we present the n - body cosmological simulation and halo catalogs .",
    "next , we describe in  [ sec : algorithms ] the two web - finding algorithms we use and in  [ sec : experiments ] the setup for out numerical experiments . in  [ sec : results ] we present our main results about the alignment of shape , angular momentum and peculiar velocities with respect to the cosmic web . in  [ sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "out of the three alignments that we study in this paper -shape , angular momentum and peculiar velocity- only the the first two have received wide attention in the literature , being angular momentum the most popular with twice the number of studies for shape alignment .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on results published during the last decade that have made use of large n - body dark matter only cosmological simulations .",
    "there are many works that have addressed this problem using observational data from large surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , however we choose to narrow our discussion to simulation based studies which are directly comparable to the one we present here .",
    "alignments are often measured from the distribution of the @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the angle between the two axes of interest .",
    "this is often directly measured as the absolute value of the dot product between the two unit vectors along the directions being tested .",
    "for instance , in the case of angular momentum one would compute @xmath9 . in the case of shape alignments",
    "the major axis is the chosen direction to compare against the cosmic web .    for an isotropic distribution of the vector around the direction defined by @xmath10 the @xmath11 distribution , ranging between @xmath12 and @xmath13 , should be flat and its mean",
    "value should be @xmath14 .",
    "if a distribution is biased towards @xmath13 ( @xmath15 ) we call this an statistical alignment along @xmath10 , while in the case of a bias towards @xmath12 ( @xmath16 ) we talk about an anti - alignment , meaning a perpendicular orientation with respect to the @xmath10 direction .",
    "@xcite presented a parametrization for the @xmath11 distribution in the case of angular momentum alignment based on theoretical considerations by @xcite ( equation [ eq : distro ] in appendix a ) . under this parametrization",
    "a unique correspondence was found between the full shape of the @xmath17 distribution and its average . in this paper",
    "we follow the lines of their work but only present the results for the average @xmath18 .",
    "tables 1 and 2 summarize recent results found in the literature for shape and angular momentum alignment .",
    "appendix a includes a detailed description of the definitions , algorithms and simulations used in each one of these studies . in these tables",
    "the first column describes the reference , the second column summarizes the web finding method with a single name , the third associates a spatial scale to the web finding methods , in most cases it corresponds to the grid size or smoothing scale used to interpolate the underlying matter density or velocity field ; the fourth column indicates along which web element ( filament or wall ) the alignment was measured ; the fifth column indicates the strength of the alignment / anti - alignment , @xmath19/@xmath20 indicate a strong alignment / anti - alignment while @xmath21/@xmath22 indicate a weaker signal ; the last column indicates whether the described signal is present within a defined range of halo mass .",
    "these results can be summarized in three important points :    * the halo mass of @xmath23is a threshold mass between behaviours of no - alignment , alignment or anti - alignment .",
    "* halo shape provides a strong alignment signal along filaments and sheets , more so for massive haloes .",
    "* halo angular momentum tends to be oriented perpendicular to filaments and parallel to sheets , but it is weaker than shape alignment .    a novel aspect of our study is the use of a single computational volume of a high resolution simulation to study the alignments . equally important , is our focus to quantify to what extent these results depend on the method used to define the cosmic web and the numerical choices to implement the algorithms .

    "in this paper  we use the bolshoi simulation that follows the non - linear evolution of a dark matter density field on cosmological scales . the volume is a cubic box with 250on a side , the matter density field is sampled with @xmath24 particles .",
    "the cosmological parameters in the simulation correspond to the results inferred from wmap5 data @xcite , which are also consistent with the more recent results of wmap9 @xcite .",
    "these parameters are @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the matter density , cosmological constant , normalization of the power spectrum , the slope in the spectrum of the primordial matter fluctuation and the dimensionless hubble constant . with these conditions the mass of each dark matter particle in the simulation",
    "corresponds to @xmath30 .",
    "a more detailed description of the simulation can be found in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use groups identified with a friends - of - friends ( fof ) halo finder using a linking length of @xmath31 times the mean interparticle separation .",
    "this choice translates into haloes with a density of @xmath32 times the mean density at @xmath33 .",
    "the measurements for the shape , angular momentum and peculiar velocity are done using the set of particles in each dark matter halo .",
    "the definition we use in this paper  for the shape comes from the diagonalization of the reduced inertia tensor .    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the particle index in the halo and @xmath36 run over the three spatial indexes and @xmath37 , where the positions are measured with respect to the centre of mass .",
    "the angular momentum is calculated as @xmath38 where the velocities are also measured with respect to the centre of mass velocity .",
    "finally the peculiar velocity of a halo is computed as the centre of mass velocity .    the halo and environment used in this paper",
    "are publicly available through the multidark data base .",
    "the halo data is thoroughly described in @xcite .",
    "we use two algorithms to define the cosmic web in cosmological n - body simulations .",
    "both are based on the same algorithmic principle , which determines locally a symmetric tensor which can be diagonalized to yield three real eigenvalues @xmath39 and their corresponding eigenvectors @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this allows for a local classification into one of the following four web types : void , sheet , filament and peak depending on whether the number of eigenvalues larger than a given threshold @xmath43 is @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath13 or @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "we use two different symmetric tensors .",
    "the first is the shear tensor , defined as the hessian of the gravitational potential , normalized in such a way as to be dimensionless :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the gravitational potential rescaled by a factor @xmath48 in such a way that the poisson equation can be written as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the matter overdensity , @xmath51 is the average matter density , @xmath52 is the hubble constant at the present time and @xmath53 is the matter density parameter .",
    "a detailed presentation of this algorithm can be found in @xcite .",
    "the second tensor is the velocity shear :    @xmath54    where the @xmath55 correspond to the components of the peculiar comoving velocities . with this definition",
    "the trace of the shear tensor is minus the divergence of the velocity field normalized by the hubble constant @xmath56 .",
    "a detailed description of this algorithm can be found in @xcite .      in this paper",
    "we compute the cosmic web on cubic grids of two different resolutions @xmath57 and @xmath58 that roughly correspond to scales of @xmath13 and @xmath59 , respectively . for the t - web",
    "we interpolate first the matter density field using a cloud - in - cell ( cic ) scheme .",
    "then we smooth using a gaussian kernel with a spatial variance equal to the size of one grid cell .",
    "this smoothed matter density field is transformed into fourier space to solve the poisson equation and find the gravitational potential @xmath47 .",
    "the hessian is computed using a finite differences method .",
    "finally , the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are computed on each grid point .    for the v - web",
    "we interpolate first the momentum density field over a grid using the cic scheme and then apply a gaussian smoothing with a spatial variance of one grid cell .",
    "we use the matter density field , which is also cic interpolated and gaussian smoothed , to normalize the momentum field .",
    "this ratio between the momentum and matter density field is what we consider as the velocity field to compute the shear tensor on each grid point . in this case",
    "we also compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors on each grid point .",
    "we caution the reader that the results reported by @xcite and @xcite use a velocity field that is calculated by a gaussian smoothing of the cic velocity field without taking into account any weight by mass .",
    "in this paper we use the data and the methods described above to perform two kinds of measurements : the preferential alignment ( pa ) and the average value of the angle along the eigenvectors of interest .",
    "we note that we measure alignments along the eigenvectors of the cosmic web without defining first whether each point corresponds to a filament or a wall .",
    "however , for simplicity and readability we describe our results in terms of alignment with respect to filaments and sheets .",
    "given that the direction along a filament should be defined by the eigenvector @xmath42 corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue @xmath60 , a strong alignment along that vector will be reported as an alignment along filaments .",
    "correspondingly , the first eigenvector @xmath40 defines the direction perpendicular to walls , a strong alignment along this vector will be reported as an anti - alignment along walls .",
    "finally , a strong alignment along the second eigenvector @xmath41 in company with an anti - alignment with @xmath61 is reported as an alignment with walls and anti - alignment with respect to filaments .",
    "we avoid the classification into filaments and walls for the following reason . partitioning",
    "the simulation into web elements implies a choice regarding the value for the parameter @xmath62 in two different web finders .",
    "this has been done before for each web finder independently .",
    "however , we consider that deriving results independent of the choice of parameters @xmath63 , @xmath64 provides clear data to understand the connection of dm haloes with the cosmic web .",
    "a possible disadvantage is that we are mixing the alignment signal of different environments .",
    "for instance , if half of the halo population of fixed mass is aligned along filaments ( the vector @xmath42 ) , and the other half along planes ( perpendicular to @xmath61 but without a clear signal along @xmath42 , @xmath41 ) , the total signal of the alignment along @xmath65 might appear diluted in comparison to a signal taken separately for filaments and walls . however , as it has been shown in @xcite the alignment signals are robust across different environments .",
    "the first measurement is a rough approximation to find out along which axes haloes are aligned .",
    "we refer to this as pa .",
    "we use the fact that for a given vector under study @xmath66 and the three eigenvectors the following identity holds    @xmath67    using this we know that all haloes can be split into three groups :    1 .",
    "haloes with @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which can be considered to aligned mostly along @xmath61 .",
    "2 .   haloes with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , which can be considered to aligned mostly along @xmath41 .",
    "haloes with @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which can be considered to aligned mostly along @xmath42 .",
    "if the halo population does not show any pa , then all the haloes must be evenly distributed along these three populations . on the contrary , if there is more than one third of the halo population in one of these sets , then this will indicate a pa along one of the axes .",
    "however , this statistics does not give a precise answer on the degree of the alignment      we emphasize that we focus on the alignments with respect to the eigenvectors regardless of the web type .",
    "we recall that the eigenvector @xmath61 is perpendicular to the plane defining a sheet and the line describing a filament ; and @xmath42 is the vector that marks the direction of a filament and lies on the plane of a sheet .",
    "therefore we focus on quantifying the degree of alignment along these two eigenvectors .",
    "this experiment complements the results obtained by the pa statistic by computing the average and standard deviation of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "we perform these tests in different populations split into different mass bins logarithmically spaced between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    in a separate test",
    "we make the same measurements but this time splitting the halo sample by other properties such as : circularity , concentration , local matter density , spin and triaxiality . in this case",
    "we take the upper and lower @xmath78 of the haloes according to each property and measure the strength of the alignment by the average value of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "[ fig : preferential ] presents all the results for the pa summarizing to a good extent the main results of this paper .",
    "the shape alignment and the v - web ( upper row , left - hand column ) give a different perspective .",
    "first , there seems to be little evidence for an alignment for masses below @xmath79 , depending on the grid resolution .",
    "secondly , the alignment at higher masses goes along the first eigenvector @xmath40 meaning that they mostly lie perpendicular to the filaments and sheets . in the discussion section",
    "we clarify this result that at first sight might seem puzzling .    for shape alignment and the t - web ( upper row , right - hand column ) we find a strong pa along the third eigenvector @xmath80 .",
    "this signal increases steadily with mass and is almost independent of the grid resolution . at high masses between @xmath81 and @xmath82 per cent of the haloes",
    "have their major axis aligned along @xmath80 which means that they mostly lie along filaments and sheets .",
    "the angular momentum in the v - web ( middle row , left - hand column ) presents a signal of alignment along the second eigenvector @xmath83 ; between @xmath84 to @xmath85 percent of the haloes are aligned along that direction , while there is a minority of haloes aligned with @xmath40 .",
    "there is a clear change in trends around @xmath79 depending on the grid resolution ; below that mass range there is no evidence for alignment while at higher masses all the trends we describe are noticeable .",
    "this means that the angular momentum of haloes above @xmath6 tends to lie along walls , parallel to the vector @xmath41 ; without any clear trend for alignment / anti - alignment with respec to filaments .    for the angular momentum alignment and the t - web ( middle row , right - hand column )",
    "we find no evidence for any alignment at low masses @xmath86 . at higher masses @xmath87 there is a weak signal of pa along the first and second eigenvectors ; between @xmath88 to @xmath84 per cent of the haloes are aligned with respect to @xmath61 and @xmath41 .",
    "correspondingly , between @xmath89 to @xmath90 of the haloes are aligned along @xmath80 .",
    "this means that most of the haloes are perpendicular to the filaments and do not have a clear alignment with respect to walls .",
    "the peculiar velocities ( lower panels ) show a weak but consistent alignment along the third eigenvector @xmath80 of the t - web for all masses below @xmath91 depending on the grid resolution .",
    "@xmath92 of the haloes are aligned this way , while only @xmath93 are aligned along the first eigenvector @xmath61 .",
    "this suggests that haloes tend to move along filaments and parallel to the walls , except at higher masses where the alignments get randomized .",
    "in contrast , the peculiar velocities with respect to the v - web show the same , although weaker , trend and only for low mass haloes @xmath94 .    in the next subsections we present a complementary account of these results by showing quantitative results of the average angle between vector pairs describing the alignments discussed so far .",
    "[ fig : shape_alignment ] presents the main results for the angles between the first and third eigenvectors and the major shape axis as a function of halo mass .",
    "notice that the errorbars shown correspond to the @xmath95 and @xmath96 percentiles ; the actual error of the medians are always small , @xmath97 percent , and therefore are not shown .",
    "in the case of the v - web ( left - hand column ) we have a clear alignment with respect to the first eigenvector at high masses @xmath87 , with values @xmath98 well above the expected value of @xmath99 for a random distribution .",
    "with respect to the third eigenvector we measure an anti - alignment with @xmath100 . for low masses @xmath86 we do not detect any alignment signal .",
    "this is consistent with the pa results of massive haloes perpendicular to filaments and parallel to walls .",
    "the t - web ( right - hand column ) shows alignment trends starting at masses of @xmath101 , two orders of magnitude below than the v - web . in this case",
    "we measure an alignment along the third eigenvector and an anti - alignment along the first eigenvector . in the latter case at the highest masses @xmath98 , while in the former at @xmath102 .",
    "this strong alignment / anti - alignment signal mirrors the interpretation from the pa results that describe haloes lying parallel both to filaments and walls .",
    "we now focus our attention on the angular momentum alignment .",
    "[ fig : spin_alignment ] shows the results as a function of halo mass following the same panel layout as in fig .",
    "[ fig : shape_alignment ] . in all cases",
    "we see that these alignment trends are weaker than the shape alignments . for",
    "the v - web low mass haloes @xmath94do not show any pa with the cosmic web .",
    "haloes more massive than this threshold have their angular momentum slightly perpendicular to the direction defined by the first eigenvector and are uncorrelated with the third eigenvector .",
    "this translates into a weak tendency for the angular momentum to lie parallel to walls .    in the case of the t - web , the alignment for low mass haloes @xmath94is also absent .",
    "more massive haloes present a weak alignment along first eigenvector and anti - alignment with the third eigenvector .",
    "this provides a quantitative expression of the results derived from the pa whereby the angular momentum is weakly perpendicular to filaments .          fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity_alignment ] shows the results for peculiar velocities alignments . in the case of the v - web ,",
    "the peculiar velocities show a weak signal of alignment ( @xmath103 ) along the third eigenvector for low masses @xmath94and a weak anti - alignment at higher masses .",
    "the strength of the alignment also shows a clear dependency on the grid size used to compute the web .",
    "the t - web shows a stronger alignment with the third eigenvector at all masses with @xmath104 and an anti - alignment with the first eigenvector with @xmath105 .",
    "in contrast to the v - web results , these trends remain basically unchanged at all masses and grid resolutions , with only minor changes for haloes masses @xmath106 .",
    "we wish to understand what other selection criteria on halo properties can produce a stronger local alignment for the shape , spin and peculiar velocities .",
    "we split the halo population into low and high mass haloes imposing a cut at @xmath107 .",
    "this allows us to have robust statistics on the high mass end .",
    "we have also computed these results for a cut at @xmath108and checked that the results we report below are not affected by this change .    for each mass interval",
    "we perform cuts in the following properties : halo spin , concentration , halo triaxiality defined as @xmath109 with high ( low ) triaxiality corresponding to prolate ( oblate ) shapes , circularity ( @xmath110 ) and halo inner density ( virial mass divided by volume out to the virial radius ) .",
    "we measure the web alignments in two sets , each one including the @xmath78 of haloes in the lower / higher end of the corresponding property .",
    "[ fig : drive ] shows the results for the major axes of the v - web and t - web ( left and right panels ) and the shape major axis , the angular momentum vector , and the halo peculiar velocity ( top , middle and bottom panels , respectively ) .",
    "as here we show the average of the halo population above the lower mass limit imposed , the halo masses that dominate the statistics are close to this lower limit @xmath111 . we show the result for the t - web and v - web calculated using the two available resolutions , but as can be seen in general we find no significant differences in our results .",
    "haloes with higher circularity and inner density show a higher alignment with the v - web major axes .",
    "the opposite is the case of haloes with higher concentration , spin and triaxiality .",
    "this trend is also visible in the angular momentum versus v - web major axis alignment only for the concentration and spin , with little differences evidenced by the other halo properties .",
    "the alignment strengthening is somewhat reversed when comparing the v - web with the halo peculiar velocity , with some evidence for a strengthening with lower circularity and inner density , and a weakening with spin and triaxiality .    on the right - hand panels the trends can also be readily seen . the t - web versus major axis alignments are stronger for higher circularity , concentration and inner density , and weaker for higher spins and triaxialities . with respect to the angular momentum ,",
    "the alignment is weaker for higher circularities , concentrations , inner densities and spins , and is only strengthened when the triaxiality is higher .",
    "not much difference is seen in the t - web versus halo peculiar velocity alignments , being this the only regime where there is a clear difference in influence of halo properties on the alignments with the t - web and v - web ; the latter do show important changes on the lower left - hand panel .",
    "as can be seen , higher concentrations , circularities and densities , as well as lower spins and triaxialities , produce a similar effect on the t - web versus major axis alignments to that of diminishing the mass of the haloes .",
    "this has also been detected in other halo properties such as their clustering amplitude in what has been termed assembly bias ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) where haloes of different ages and equal mass show different clustering amplitudes , which could also be interpreted as a change in the effective halo mass according to halo properties .",
    "an older halo age has been shown to come along with more spherical halo shapes , higher concentrations and halo inner density . however , in the assembly bias scenario of @xcite , these haloes tend to show a clustering amplitude consistent with that of the median halo population of higher masses . in terms of the alignments with the t - web , our results show the opposite trend .",
    "this shows that the physics behind the clustering amplitude and alignments do not necessarily coincide .",
    "the full understanding of the dependence of halo properties and/or on their environment is a complex problem , but these results provide extra information that complements that obtained from clustering measurements .          ,",
    "scaledwidth=40.0% ]    perhaps the most striking result so far is that the two web algorithms give different results for the alignment of massive haloes .",
    "this is not completely unexpected given that the two algorithms are based on different physical premises to obtain the directions defining the eigenvectors .",
    "however , we investigate the origin of the different alignment statistics by studying the inter - web alignment .    for the two algorithms , t - web and v - web , we have the information for their eigenvectors and eigenvalues on exactly the same positions defined by the grids .",
    "this allows us to compute the pair - wise alignment between the eigenvectors in the two web finders .",
    "we restrict our analysis to the grid cells that are occupied by haloes .",
    "otherwise , if we decided to perform this kind of analysis on all the grid cells , the statistics would be more representative of the void regions as they dominate in number the fraction of cells in the simulation .    fig .",
    "[ fig : interweb ] shows the values for @xmath112 between the two @xmath61 eigenvectors in the t - web and the v - web .",
    "the figure shows that there is an alignment , @xmath113 , for low mass haloes and an anti - alignment , @xmath114 for massive ones .",
    "the transitional scale is located around @xmath115depending on the grid resolution .",
    "the coarse grid @xmath116 shows the transition at higher masses than the fine grid @xmath117 .",
    "we also note that the alignment is weaker in the finer grid , ( @xmath118 ) than in the coarser grid ( @xmath119 ) .    these two facts ( alignment at low masses and low grid resolution ) points towards an explanation in terms of the linear / non - linear growth of structure .",
    "when the alignment is present on linear scales the divergence of the velocity field is proportional to the overdensity , i.e. the trace of the shear field is proportional to the trace of the tidal field .    on the scale where",
    "the haloes more massive than @xmath120are located , the relationship between the velocity shear and the tidal field changes .",
    "there , the fastest momentum - weighted collapse direction ( defined by the v - web ) is perpendicular to the direction where the tidal compression is the highest .",
    "it is possible to consider that numerical effects can also affect the estimation of the eigenvectors .",
    "for instance , different levels of shot noise in the interpolation scheme to construct the density and momentum grids could contribute to the anti - alignment of the two algorithms .",
    "however , a detailed study of the inter - web alignments is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have examined the alignment of shape , angular momentum and peculiar velocity of dm haloes with respect to the cosmic web .",
    "we use publicly available data from two algorithms implemented on a large cosmological n - body simulation to study halo populations spanning five orders of magnitude in mass .",
    "the first algorithm uses the tidal field ( t - web ) and the second the velocity shear ( v - web ) ; both include results on spatial scales of @xmath99 and @xmath121 .",
    "we quantify the alignments in two complementary ways .",
    "the first one measures the fraction of haloes in a population that is preferentially aligned with either one of the eigenvectors @xmath61 , @xmath41 or @xmath42 in the local definition of the cosmic web .",
    "the second method measures the average value of the angle between an eigenvector and the vector of interest .",
    "these two measurements give us a complete picture for the different degrees of alignment in the web .",
    "we find that the strongest alignment occurs for the halo shape with respect to the t - web . in this case",
    "the haloes tend to align with the third eigenvector , @xmath42 , meaning that they lie along filaments and walls .",
    "this trend gets stronger as the halo mass increases and agrees with all the results published so far . instead , for the momentum based v - web",
    ", there is only an anti - alignment for haloes more massive than @xmath6 , a result that is presented here for the first time .",
    "a much weaker alignment signal is present for the angular momentum . in the t - web",
    "only the most massive haloes @xmath4are perpendicular with respect to @xmath42 ( anti - aligned to filaments ) , while for the v - web the massive haloes are aligned with @xmath41 , lying along sheets .",
    "these results broadly agree with the published literature .",
    "nevertheless , in some publications @xcite there is an alignment signal reported at lower halo masses @xmath94that we do not detect in our measurements .",
    "actually @xcite , using a multiscale web - finding method , confirmed the mass @xmath5as a transitional scale between alignment /anti - alignment in filaments , showing that it reflects the degree of evolution of the host filament .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the discrepancy .",
    "the first is that in this low mass range the signal for the different environments ( mostly filaments and sheets ) is mixed , diluting the strength of the alignment .",
    "another possible explanation can be appreciated by carefully looking at the results for different resolutions .",
    "the @xmath58 grid does show a small anti - alignment for low mass haloes indicating that this signal could be related to scales smaller than @xmath122 .",
    "this would be consistent with @xcite where , using a different technique , they find an alignment for low mass haloes with the structure on small scales , and an anti - alignment at large scales ( the two - halo term ) .",
    "the diversity of results could be then interpreted as a high sensitivity of the alignment signal to the small scale cosmic web description , including numerical choices as to how the relevant fields are interpolated .",
    "a new result from our study is the alignment for the peculiar velocities . here",
    "we find a relatively strong signal of alignment along the direction defined by the third eigenvector , @xmath42 , and perpendicular to the first , @xmath61 .",
    "this signal is clear in the t - web for all masses below @xmath123 .",
    "this can be interpreted as a flow parallel to walls and filaments . in the case of the v - web similar signal ,",
    "albeit weaker , is present only for the low mass haloes @xmath86 .",
    "a similar result was obtained by @xcite who found that peculiar velocities are larger in the direction parallel to void walls .",
    "the different behaviour for the alignments of massive haloes in the t - web and the v - web is explained by an anti - alignment between the eigenvectors in the two web grids for massive haloes @xmath87 . for low mass",
    "haloes the directions defined by the two webs point in the same direction .",
    "this trends can be interpreted as non - linear effects that appear in the two different physical descriptions for the cosmic web , but the impact of the numerical choices to build the interpolation must be studied as well .",
    "we also performed a simple study to find evidence of halo properties , other than mass , in driving the alignments .",
    "we find that in the case of shape , high concentration haloes or haloes with a low value of the reduced spin parameter tend to show a stronger signal .",
    "this trend is more pronounced in the t - web than in the v - web .",
    "concerning angular momentum we find that the anti - alignment signal is stronger for haloes with high spin values . in the peculiar velocities",
    "we do not find any effect in the t - web alignments , and the results for the v - web show wide variations with grid resolution that impedes driving any strong conclusion .",
    "our study has shown that the alignment properties of dm haloes depend on the physical definition of the cosmic web .",
    "this shows that the main aspect of non - linear gravitational collapse might be revealed easily depending on the choice of the physical context ( e.g. tidal field versus velocity shear ) .",
    "there is not a better method , but different perspectives . in future work",
    "we will explore the potential of these two complementary techniques in understanding the environmental dependence of galaxy evolution .",
