    "during the last decades , physicists have developed several tools to study the statistical properties of physical systems violating the requirements of standard statistical mechanics of thermal equilibrium .",
    "such systems are ubiquitous in nature . for instance",
    ", the dynamics of the system can be so slow that the thermodynamic equilibrium is , in practice , never reached as is the case for materials below the glass transition @xcite .",
    "conversely , some systems may require a continuous injection of energy to be maintained in a steady - state .",
    "this energy injection may occur in the bulk , like in active systems , or from the boundary as is typical in shaken or sheared materials .",
    "bulk driven systems can be found for instance in biology where , due to improvements of observation techniques , the fluctuations of tiny active units like molecular motors can now be studied @xcite . on the other side ,",
    "granular media are a typical example of an externally driven system that , due to the dissipative nature of the contact between the grains , can not sustain a fluctuating state in the absence of driving .",
    "such granular systems can not be described by the classical tools of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "model granular media experiments have become a convenient means of investigating the physics of non - equilibrium steady state ( ness ) systems @xcite .",
    "specially , the interest in the effects of the dissipative nature of the collision between the particles led to the experimental realization of granular gases obtained , in three - dimensions ( 3d ) , by vibrating the container @xcite and , in two - dimensions ( 2d ) , by considering beads covering partially a horizontal surface animated by a vertical motion @xcite .",
    "all these experiments , together with their theoretical counterpart , revealed deviations from the equilibrium statistics , especially in the velocity distributions @xcite .    at this point , it is particularly interesting to raise the question of the thermalization of the system . indeed , especially in the case of 2d experiments",
    ", one can wonder if the deviation of the velocity statistics from the equilibrium ones comes from the dissipative nature of the collisions between the particles or from the peculiar nature of the thermostat the beads are in contact with .",
    "let us for instance remark that , for a dissipative gas in contact with a thermostat , a decrease of the kinetic temperature is expected from an increase of the density ( because of the increase of the collision rate ) @xcite . in the experiments ,",
    "one rather observes an increase of the temperature with the density @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to question the quality of the thermostat constituted by the vibrating plate in the 2d experiments .",
    "thinking of the most simple realization of a system in contact with the vibrated plate , one naturally comes to the problem of the bouncing bead which has been widely studied during the late 1980 s to investigate the route to chaos by period doubling @xcite . in the chaotic regime",
    ", the system can however be regarded as a single particle in contact with an energy reservoir and one can instead focus on the statistical properties of the energy of the bead , like its average value and its fluctuations . in their experimental realization of the problem , using a sinusoidal motion of the plate , warr _ et al _ observed that the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the particle velocity is well - approximated by a gaussian distribution , and the pdf of the particle energy by a boltzmann - type distribution @xcite .",
    "however , a detailed study of the correlation of the energy states through the collisions reveals partial synchronization of the bead motion with that of the vibrating surface , even if the bead experiences a chaotic trajectory @xcite .",
    "in addition , in another study , it has been shown that the removal of part of the synchronization with the plate motion , can lead to an increase of the average energy of the particle for the same characteristics of the plate vibration @xcite , questionning again the notion of thermostat .    here",
    ", we study from a statistical physics perspective the dynamics of a bouncing particle maintained in a chaotic regime thanks to collisions with a plate experiencing an aperiodic vibration .",
    "indeed , we proposed lately a manner to produce an aperiodic vibration of the plate while keeping the vibration characteristics , especially its maximum velocity , well - defined .",
    "we thus propose an alternative way to produce a random vibration of the plate which differs significantly from the random vibration used in some recent experiments @xcite .",
    "we first show that the height , velocity and energy distributions resemble the equilibrium distributions @xcite , leading to a measure of the particle temperature .",
    "then , we analyze in details the energy exchanges between the bead and the vibrating plate , and show that these energy exchanges can be modeled in terms of both a dissipative process and an injection mechanism by an energy reservoir .",
    "the latter partition of the energy exchanges makes possible to recover the minimum reversibility ( any transition from one value of the energy to another is possible in reverse direction ) that makes possible the use of several tools of non - equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "we thus subsequently estimate the rate of entropy production , test the detailed balance and evaluate the validity of fluctuation relations , each of these tools leading to the introduction of its own temperature scale , that can be compared one to the other .",
    "the system under study consists of a bead bouncing freely upon a horizontal plate which oscillates along the vertical direction ( fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the height of the plate and by @xmath1 its velocity . in the same way , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the height and the velocity of the bead .",
    "we choose a common height reference , in such a way that @xmath4 when the bead and the plate are in contact .",
    "sketch of the system . ]",
    "the overall trajectory of the bead consists of a series of collisions with the plate , at time @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the index of the collision ) , separated by a time @xmath7 of free fall .",
    "the dissipative nature of the collisions is accounted for by introducing a single parameter , the _ restitution coefficient _",
    "@xmath8 , such that the rebound velocity of the bead ( its velocity relative to the velocity of the plate after the collision ) is proportional to the impact velocity ( the bead velocity relative to the velocity of the plate before the collision ) , i.e. @xmath9 in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : collision ] ) , @xmath10 stands for the velocity of the plate at the collision @xmath6 , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 for the velocity of the bead before and after the collision , respectively .",
    "note that we thus assume that the collisions are intantaneous and that @xmath8 is independent from the impact velocity @xmath13 , which is a good approximation for most of the practical cases @xcite .",
    "between two subsequent collisions , during the free fall from time @xmath5 to time @xmath14 , the bead is only subject to the acceleration due to gravity @xmath15 and its height given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the height at @xmath18 .",
    "provided the height of the plate @xmath0 is known at all times , one can determine the entire trajectory of the bead by using the equations accounting for the collisions [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : collision ] ) ] and for the free fall [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : free fall ] ) ] . indeed , from the knowledge of the takeoff velocity of the bead , @xmath12 right after the collision @xmath6 at time @xmath19 , one can determine the next collision time @xmath14 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : free fall ] ) and the condition @xmath20 .",
    "the velocity of the bead before the collision at @xmath14 is then given by @xmath21 .",
    "then , one can use the collision rule eq .",
    "( [ eq : collision ] ) to calculate the takeoff velocity of the bead , @xmath22 right after the collision @xmath23 .",
    "the procedure can be iterated to determine the entire trajectory @xcite .",
    "the aim of our study is to report on statistical properties of the ball trajectory in a chaotic regime . a common way to achieve a chaotic regime",
    "consists in imposing a sinusoidal plate - motion , @xmath24 , with a large dimensionless acceleration @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "however , even if a large @xmath26 insures that the bead experiences a chaotic motion , unwanted synchronization effects still remain @xcite .",
    "techniques to avoid these effects could consist in using quasi - periodic @xcite or random motion of the plate @xcite .",
    "quasi - periodic motion of the plate does not make the underlying frequency disappear and there is still a risk of partial synchronization .",
    "the random motion of plate is achieved , in practice , by feeding an electromagnetic , mechanical , system with a random driving signal ( a colored gaussian noise in @xcite ) which is then filtered by the mechanical system . even if the motion of the plate is characterized subsequently , it is difficult to impose all the characteristics of the plate motion .",
    "we proposed lately an alternative protocol @xcite that gets rid of some of the ball - plate synchronization effects , while keeping constant the maximum velocity @xmath27 reached by the plate during each of the cycles .",
    "the motion of the plate consists of a series of sinusoidal cycles , @xmath28 such that @xmath29 .",
    "the cycle @xmath30 begins at time @xmath31 such that @xmath32 and lasts for a duration @xmath33 .",
    "this choice insures that the vertical position of the plate @xmath34 , its velocity , @xmath35 , and its acceleration are continuous at all time , whatever the choice of the set of @xmath36 .",
    "the plate motion is thus well - characterized not only in the model , but also in its experimental counterpart .    from now on , in order to avoid temporal synchronization of the bead motion with the motion of the plate , the @xmath36 are chosen randomly , with uniform probability , in an interval of width 25% around the central value @xmath37 , namely @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "we remind that the series of amplitude @xmath39 is accordingly chosen so as to insure @xmath29 . in addition , even if the maximum acceleration @xmath40 is not constant from one cycle to another , we use , for convenience , the dimensionless acceleration @xmath41 as the control parameter specifying the working conditions .",
    "we first determine the probability distribution function of the velocity @xmath42 and of the height @xmath43 of the bead through time .",
    "we thus consider the probabilities @xmath44 and @xmath45 that , all along the trajectory , the bead moves with the velocity @xmath42 or be at the height @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_h_u ] . note that we use dimensionless quantities , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "introducing further the mass of the bead , @xmath48 ( even if it does not play any role in the dynamics ) , to make the next expressions look more familiar , we observe that @xmath44 and @xmath45 are well - described by effective equilibrium distributions @xcite @xmath49 with the same temperature @xmath50 for both height , @xmath43 , and velocity , @xmath42 .",
    "the result holds true as long as the restitution coefficient @xmath8 remains close to unity .",

    "in particular , we report in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_ec ] the probability distribution of the total energy at the collisions , @xmath64 , which will prove useful in the next section .",
    "we observe a clear exponential behavior well accounted for by @xmath65 with the same temperature @xmath50 .",
    "the difference between eq .",
    "( [ eq : pte ] ) and eq .  ( [ eq : pce ] ) comes from the reweighting , in the temporal average , of energy value @xmath59 by the duration of the free fall between two successive collisions .",
    "indeed , the duration of flight associated with larger energy is larger .",
    "more precisely , in our working conditions , the maximum height reached by the bead is large compared to the typical amplitude @xmath66 of the plate motion . in this limit ,",
    "the duration of the flight is proportional to the takeoff velocity , @xmath67 . in the same limit ,",
    "the potential energy is negligible as compared to the kinetic energy and @xmath68 .",
    "taking thus into account that the free - fall duration between two successive collisions is proportional to @xmath69 , one easily deduces eq .",

    "( [ eq : pce ] ) ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) . ]    in summary , at first sight , the system exhibits probability distributions that greatly resemble equilibrium distributions in spite of the peculiar , and dissipative , nature of the `` thermostat '' . from the probability distributions ,",
    "one obtains a single temperature @xmath50 .",
    "however , the latter must be taken with care .",
    "indeed , for instance , the temperature that we define here is not a property of the thermostat alone as it depends on the mass , @xmath48 , of the bead see eq .",
    "( [ eq : kt ] ) .",
    "in addition , we have shown that an equilibrium distribution for the energy is also obtained when considering the state of the system at the collisions only , as reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdf_ec ] . doing so , we disregard the fact that the duration of the states depends on the associated energy , which removes the factor @xmath69 in front of the exponential in the energy distribution .",
    "however , from a formal point of view , we can regard the statistics of energy states separated by contacts of the system ( the bead ) with the thermostat . in the following",
    ", we shall consider statistical properties of quantities at the collisions , in particular the energy increments , to discuss the quality of the `` thermostat '' and the potential definitions of the temperature .",
    "we have shown , by studying the distributions of the velocity @xmath42 , height @xmath43 and total energy @xmath59 , that the bouncing bead could be described , to a good approximation , as an equibrium system at an effective temperature @xmath50 ( sec .",
    "[ sec : statchar ] ) .",
    "a natural question is thus to know whether the vibrating plate , which both injects and dissipates energy , indeed plays the role of a thermostat at temperature @xmath50 . in this section ,",
    "we first characterize the statistics of energy increments , and then proceed to a more detailed analysis in terms of probability fluxes , with the aim to test the hypothesis of detailed balance that , in principle , underlies the notion of energy reservoir .      at each collision",
    ", the total energy of the bead evolves from a value @xmath59 , before the collision , to @xmath71 , after the collision .",

    "[ fig : pdet ] .",
    "we first notice that the distribution is asymmetric , which is already a clue that the system is not in contact with a classical thermostat .",
    "the most probable value is positive but , we remind , the mean value is zero since , on average , the bead neither loses nor gains energy .",
    "the left tail of the distribution is essentially exponential , while its right tail decays faster than exponentially .",
    "such a distribution of energy increments is reminiscent of the bhp distribution reported , among others , in closed turbulent flows @xcite .",
    "probability distribution @xmath75 of the increments of energy @xmath74 , obtained by averaging over collisions ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) . ]      to analyze more precisely the dynamics of energy exchanges , we turn to a detailed characterization of the transition probabilities between different energies .",
    "our goal is to test whether the energy - exchange dynamics obeys microreversibility ( or detailed balance in the language of stochastic processes ) , a standard requirement for a microscopic heat reservoir @xcite .",
    "there is _ a priori _ no reason that such a macroscopic and dissipative system like a bead on a vibrating plate satisfies this property .",
    "however , we wish to assess how far a simple macroscopic system can be analyzed and modeled in terms of concepts coming from statistical physics of microscopic systems and thermodynamics .",
    "we first define @xmath76 , the probability for the system to evolve from energy @xmath59 to @xmath71 during a collision with the plate .",
    "this quantity can be directly measured in the numerical simulations , and will play a key role in the following analysis . to be more specific ,",
    "@xmath76 is a probability density , in the sense that @xmath77 is the probability to observe a transition from the energy interval @xmath78 $ ] to the energy interval @xmath79 $ ] .",
    "detailed balance ( or microreversibility ) corresponds to the fact that the probability to observe a given trajectory is equal to the probability to observe the time - reversed trajectory . in other words , @xmath80 .",

    "in this work , we aimed at analyzing a very simple driven mechanical - system , a bead bouncing on a vibrated plate , using concepts from equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical physics .",

    "note that this temperature additionally depends on the mass of the particle , unlike the temperature of standard thermostats .",
    "however , a more careful and detailed analysis reveals that this , apparently , simple effective - equilibrium picture actually hides a complex nonequilibrium dynamics at the level of the energy exchanges between the bead and the plate .",
    "a simple analysis in terms of a single reservoir at temperature @xmath50 fails : indeed , the reservoir does not follow standard requirements of reversibility of the transition , in the sense that some transitions between two energy values that are possible in one direction are not possible in the reverse direction .",

    "we show that reversibility can be partly recovered by separating a dissipative contribution from the energy exchanges between the bead and the plate .",

    "such procedure makes possible to perform tests on the statistical properties of the energy increments .",
    "first , one can assess the rate of entropy production ( sec .",
    "[ sec : rate of entropy creation ] ) and , then , using the relation with the heat flux across the system , define a first temperature characterizing the system @xmath190 , which is thus found to be of the order of @xmath50 .",

    "we propose a tentative way out of this conundrum by showing in appendix [ appendix ] that the breaking of detailed balance also induces a bias in the temperature measurement that could account for the paradoxical result obtained .",
    "further research in this direction would actually be needed to confirm this potential explanation .",
    "finally , we complement the analysis of the data by considering briefly another now standard way of characterizing an energy injection source , namely the fluctuation relations .",
    "even if the fluctuation relation in its standard form is not satisfied , it is still possible to extract a temperature scale from the data , leading to a temperature value @xmath198 .",
    "we see that even one of the simplest driven macroscopic system one can think of can hardly be described in details by equilibrium statistical physics concepts , despite the equilibrium form of the distribution of velocity and height of the bead .",
    "note that , in spite of the proliferation of their values , we find that all temperatures scale in the same way , meaning that the ratios @xmath199 , @xmath200 and @xmath201 are all independent of the acceleration @xmath26 and of the restitution coefficient @xmath8 . however , we observe that the precise value of the temperature depends on the tool we use , which is not a surprize as they do not characterize exactly the same physical processes .    to conclude ,",
    "let us emphasize that the fact standard equilibrium concepts do not apply in this strongly driven system was expected and does not come as a surprise .",
    "what is actually more surprising is that these concepts at least partially apply , and still provide reasonable guidelines to study the system .",
    "indeed , the probability distributions of velocity , height and energy take an equilibrium form with an effective temperature , and a `` noisy '' version of detailed balance holds once a suitable splitting between dissipated and injected energy is made .",
    "the fact that not all temperatures measured coincide is certainly the price to pay in order to describe such a nonequilibrium systems with close - to - equilibrium concepts .",
    "future work should probably try to identify a theoretical framework which possibly unifies the description using genuine nonequilibrium concepts .",
    "in this appendix , we discuss how the lack of detailed balance may lead to an effective temperature , measured from a blurred detailed balance relation as shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : kt_inj ] , that is different from the nominal temperature at which degrees of freedom are seen to equilibrate .",
    "let us consider a nonequilibrium reservoir such that a system put in contact with it equilibrates at a temperature @xmath202 . in the absence of detailed balance , a nonzero probability flux , @xmath203 is present between energies @xmath59 and @xmath71 .",
