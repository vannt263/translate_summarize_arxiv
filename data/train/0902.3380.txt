    "in the _ tropical semiring _ @xmath12 one defines `` multiplication '' and `` addition '' by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "real @xmath15-space @xmath16 has the natural structure of a semimodule over the tropical semiring so that one obtains a theory of `` tropical geometry . ''",
    "given any classical geometric notion , one may try to construct reasonable analogues in tropical geometry and study their properties .",
    "this has been a very lively direction of research over recent years .",
    "a brief introduction is @xcite . for more background",
    "the reader may e.g.  consult the extensive list of references appearing in @xcite .    consider the classical concept of @xmath15 points on a line in @xmath17 .",
    "such point sets are characterized by the property that their convex hull is at most one - dimensional .",
    "an equivalent characterization is that all points lie in the convex hull of at most two of the points . in tropical geometry",
    ", there is a natural notion of _ tropical convex hull _ which leads to obvious analogues of the above characterizations .",
    "however , the two analogues differ ; the latter is more restrictive .",
    "considering the points as columns of matrices , the former situation deals with matrices of _ tropical rank _ at most @xmath18 , whereas the latter leads one to consider matrices of _ barvinok rank _ at most @xmath18 .",
    "various tropically motivated definitions of rank are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the concept of barvinok rank has found applications in optimization theory . motivating the nomenclature , barvinok et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the maximum version of the travelling salesman problem can be solved in polynomial time if the barvinok rank of the distance matrix is fixed ( with @xmath19 denoting @xmath20 rather than @xmath21 ) .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the set of @xmath23 matrices with real entries . in this paper , we are interested in the space of matrices @xmath24 with barvinok rank @xmath18 , corresponding to sets of @xmath15 marked points in @xmath17 whose tropical convex hull is generated by two of the points .",
    "the space contains some topologically less interesting features in that it is invariant under rescaling and translation . taking the quotient by the equivalence relation generated by these operations , one obtains a space @xmath2 which is our object of study .",
    "develin @xcite conjectured that @xmath2 is a manifold and that its homology `` does not increase in complexity as @xmath15 gets large '' .",
    "he confirmed the conjecture for @xmath25 and computed the integral homology in a few more accessible cases .",
    "our main results are summarized in the following two theorems :    [ th : manifold ] the space @xmath2 is homeomorphic to @xmath26 , the quotient of the product of two spheres under the involution which sends each point to its antipode simultaneously in both components .",
    "[ th : homology ] the reduced integral homology groups of @xmath2 are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29    when a finite group acts freely on a manifold , the quotient is again a manifold .",
    "in particular , therefore , the manifold part of develin s conjecture follows from theorem [ th : manifold ] , whereas the `` complexity of homology '' part is implied by theorem [ th : homology ] .",
    "for @xmath4 , note that the homology of @xmath2 coincides with that of @xmath30 for odd @xmath5 . for even @xmath5 ,",
    "the homology groups of the two manifolds differ in higher degrees for reasons to be explained in section  [ se : homology ] .    for the computations that lead to theorem [ th : homology ]",
    ", we have opted to work with slightly more general chain complexes , since this requires no additional effort .",
    "an advantage of this approach is that it highlights the connection between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "specifically , for any finite cell complex @xmath10 with a free @xmath11-action , we show that @xmath33 and @xmath34 have the same homology whenever @xmath35 and @xmath5 is odd . for even @xmath5 ,",
    "there is still a connection , but the situation is slightly more complicated ; see theorem  [ th : vhemi ] for details .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we review some concepts from tropical geometry in the next section . in section [ se : bdn ] , @xmath2 is defined and given an explicit simplicial decomposition in terms of trees . from it , theorem [ th : manifold ] is deduced .",
    "the last section is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ th : homology ] .",
    "our approach is based on forman s discrete morse theory @xcite .",
    "recall that in the tropical semiring we define @xmath13 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 .",
    "for example , @xmath38    a natural semimodule structure on @xmath16 is provided by the `` addition '' @xmath39 and the `` multiplication by scalar '' @xmath40    following @xcite we say that @xmath41 is _ tropically convex _ if @xmath42 for all @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "note that if @xmath45 is tropically convex , then @xmath46 for all @xmath47 , @xmath48 . defining _ tropical projective space _ @xmath49 any tropically convex set in @xmath16 is therefore uniquely determined by its image in @xmath50 .",
    "we obtain a convenient set of representatives for the elements of tropical projective space by requiring the first coordinate to be zero .    the _ tropical convex hull _",
    "@xmath51 is the smallest tropically convex set which contains @xmath41 .",
    "it coincides with the set of finite tropical linear combinations : @xmath52 see @xcite .",
    "an important observation is that the tropical convex hull of two points in @xmath16 forms a piecewise linear curve in @xmath50 .",
    "this curve is the _ tropical line segment _ between the two points .    in figure [ fi : hulls ] , the tropical convex hulls of two three - point sets in @xmath53 are shown .",
    "according to the next definition , the @xmath54 matrix with the three left - hand points as columns has tropical rank @xmath55 , whereas the points to the right form a matrix of tropical rank @xmath18 .",
    "the _ tropical rank _ of @xmath24 equals one plus the dimension in @xmath56 of the tropical convex hull of the columns of @xmath57 .",
    "in particular , a matrix has tropical rank at most @xmath18 if and only if the tropical convex hull of its columns is the union of the tropical line segments between all pairs of columns .",
    "the _ barvinok rank _ of @xmath24 equals the smallest number of points in @xmath17 whose tropical convex hull contains all columns of @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to see that the barvinok rank can not be smaller than the tropical rank . in general , the two notions are different .",
    "for example , the two matrices whose columns are the point sets in figure [ fi : hulls ] both have barvinok rank @xmath55 .    observe that a matrix has barvinok rank at most @xmath18 if and only if the tropical convex hull of its columns is a tropical line segment .",
    "in this section , we shall deduce theorem [ th : manifold ] . to begin with ,",
    "we define the space @xmath2 which encodes the topologically interesting part of the space of matrices of barvinok rank @xmath18 .",
    "we think of @xmath2 as sitting inside @xmath58 with the subspace topology .",
    "fix positive integers @xmath5 and @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath59 . as usual , we consider the columns of @xmath57 as a collection of @xmath15 marked points in @xmath17 . adding any real number to any row or any column of @xmath57 preserves the barvinok rank ; adding to a row merely translates the point set , whereas adding to a column yields another representative for the same point in @xmath56 .",
    "similarly , multiplying @xmath57 by any @xmath60 does not increase the barvinok rank ( which is preserved if @xmath61 ) .    in order to get unique representatives for matrices under the operations just described , the following definition is convenient .",
    "[ de : representatives ] let @xmath2 be the set of matrices @xmath59 satisfying    * the first row of @xmath57 is zero . *",

    "let @xmath62 and @xmath63 be disjoint sets of cardinality @xmath5 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we now describe an abstract simplicial complex with @xmath2 as geometric realization .",
    "the simplices are encoded by combinatorial trees whose leaves are marked using @xmath64 and @xmath65 as label sets .",
    "this model is equivalent to that given by develin in ( * ? ? ?",
    "*    3 ) . and",
    "its incident edge by a leaf `` heading off to infinity in the @xmath66-th coordinate direction '' , and replace the leaf labelled @xmath67 and its incident edge by the @xmath66-th marked point . ] a completely analogous description in the context of matrices of tropical rank @xmath18 was given by markwig and yu @xcite ; their complex is denoted @xmath68 below .",
    "consider the set of trees @xmath69 with leaf set @xmath70 such that every internal vertex ( i.e.  non - leaf ) has degree at least three .",
    "we may think of @xmath69 as a simplicial complex in the following way .",
    "the vertex set of the complex consists of all bipartitions of @xmath70 , and we identify a tree @xmath71 with the simplex comprised of the bipartitions induced by the connected components that arise when an internal edge ( one not incident to a leaf ) of @xmath72 is removed .",
    "( it is well - known , and easy to see , that there is at most one tree giving rise to any given set of bipartitions . ) clearly , the simplices in the boundary of @xmath72 are those obtained by contracting internal edges .",

    "then , @xmath76 is a tropical line segment in @xmath56 .",
    "now construct a tree @xmath77 whose internal vertex set is the union of @xmath78 and the set of points where the curve @xmath79 is not smooth .",
    "two internal vertices @xmath80 are adjacent if and only if @xmath81 ( which is a subset of @xmath79 ) contains no other internal vertex .",
    "the leaf set of @xmath72 is @xmath70 .",
    "the leaf @xmath82 is adjacent to the internal vertex which is closest to the origin ( which , by condition ( ii ) of definition [ de : representatives ] , is necessarily an internal vertex ) among those where the @xmath66-th coordinate is maximized .",
    "finally , the leaf @xmath67 is adjacent to the vertex @xmath83 .",
    "the resulting tree ( seen as an abstract , leaf - labelled tree ) is @xmath72 .",
    "[ ex : example ] consider the @xmath84 matrix @xmath85 we shall see shortly that @xmath57 has barvinok rank @xmath18 . however , @xmath57 does not satisfy the conditions of definition [ de : representatives ] , hence does not belong to @xmath86 .",
    "subtracting the first row of @xmath57 from each row , adding an appropriate amount to each row and rescaling , we obtain the following matrix which represents the equivalence class of @xmath57 in @xmath86 : @xmath87 the tropical convex hull of the columns of @xmath88 is shown in figure [ fi : example ] .",
