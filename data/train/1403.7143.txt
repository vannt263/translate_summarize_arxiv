    "analysing the deuterium fractionation in different galactic objects which will eventually form new suns , and in comets , meteorites and small bodies of the solar system is like having in our hands a box of old photos with the imprint of memories , from the very first steps of the solar system formation .",
    "the goal of this chapter is trying to understand the message that these photos bring , using our knowledge of the different objects and , in particular , the ariadne s thread of the deuterium fractionation to link them together in a sequence that is the one that followed the solar system formation .",

    "[ tab : definitions ] ) and destroyed in the interiors of the stars .",
    "therefore , its abundance may vary from place to place : for example , it is lower in regions close to the galactic center , where the star formation is high , than in the solar system neighborhood @xcite .",
    "if there were no deuterium fractionation , a species with one h - atom , like for example hcn , would have a relative abundance of d - atom over h - atom bearing molecules equal to @xmath6 , namely dcn / hcn@xmath7 . as another important example",
    ", water would have hdo / h@xmath2o=@xmath8 .",
    "similarly , a species with two hydrogens will have a relative abundance of molecules with two d - atoms proportional to @xmath9 ( e.g. , d@xmath2o / h@xmath2o@xmath10 ) and so on . in practice ,",
    "if there were no deuterium fractionation , the abundance of d - bearing molecules would be ridiculously low .",
    "but in space things are special enough to make the conditions propitious for deuterium fractionation ( or molecular deuteration or deuterium enrichment ) to occur .",

    "the inverse reaction h@xmath2 + h@xmath2d@xmath3 which would form hd has a ( small ) activation barrier so that at low temperatures h@xmath2d@xmath3/h@xmath1 becomes larger than @xmath6 .",
    "similarly , d@xmath2h@xmath3 and d@xmath1 are formed by reactions with hd .",
    "+ _ 3 ) formation of other d - bearing molecules : _",
    "h@xmath2d@xmath3 , d@xmath2h@xmath3 and d@xmath1 react with other molecules and atoms transferring the d - atoms to all the other species .",
    "this can happen directly in the gas phase ( _ step 3a _ in fig .",
    "[ fig : d - chemistry - scheme ] ) or on the grain mantles ( _ step 3b _ ) via the d atoms created by the h@xmath2d@xmath3 , d@xmath2h@xmath3 and d@xmath1 dissociative recombination with electrons . in both cases ,",
    "the deuterium fractionation depends on the h@xmath2d@xmath3/h@xmath1 , d@xmath2h@xmath3/h@xmath1 and d@xmath1/h@xmath1 abundance ratios .        therefore , generally speaking , the basic molecule for the deuterium fractionation is h@xmath2d@xmath3 ( and d@xmath2h@xmath3 and d@xmath1 in extreme conditions ) . the cause for the enhancement of h@xmath2d@xmath3 with respect to h@xmath1 and ,",
    "consequently , deuterium fractionation is the larger mass ( equivalent to a higher zero energy ) of h@xmath2d@xmath3 with respect to h@xmath1 , which causes the activation barrier in step 2 .",
    "the quantity which governs whether the barrier can be overcome and , consequently , the deuterium fractionation is the temperature : the lower the temperature the larger the deuterium fractionation .    besides , if abundant neutrals and important destruction partners of h@xmath1 isotopologues , such as o and co , deplete from the gas - phase ( for example because of the freeze - out onto dust grains in cold and dense regions ;  [ sec : the - pre - stell ] and  [ sec : the - prot - disk ] ) , the deuterium fraction further increases @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the destruction rates of all the h@xmath1 isotopologues drop , while the formation rate of the deuterated species increases because of the enhanced h@xmath1 abundance .",
    "there is another factor that strongly affects the deuterium fractionation : the ortho - to - para abundance ratio of h@xmath2 molecules .",
    "in fact , if this ratio is larger than @xmath12 , the internal energy of the ortho h@xmath2 molecules ( whose lowest energy level is @xmath13 k ) can be enough to overcome the h@xmath2d@xmath3 + h@xmath2 @xmath14 hd + h@xmath1 barrier and limit the h@xmath2d@xmath3/h@xmath1 ratio . in general",
    ", it is believed that ortho and para h@xmath2 are formed on the surface of dust grains with a statistical ratio of 3:1 .",
    "proton - exchange reactions then convert ortho- into para- h@xmath2 , especially at the low temperatures of dense cloud cores , where the ortho - to - para h@xmath2 ratio is predicted to drop below 10@xmath15 .",

    "ch@xmath2d@xmath3 and od play the role of h@xmath2d@xmath3 at lower temperatures . at @xmath20",
    "k water can directly exchange d and h atoms with h@xmath2 .",
    "finally , some molecules , notably water , are synthesised on the surfaces of interstellar and interplanetary grains by addition and/or substitution of h and d atoms (  [ sec : fract - water ] ) . in this case , the deuterium fractionation depends on the d / h ratio of the atomic gas .",
    "as discussed previously in this section , the enhanced abundance of h@xmath2d@xmath3 ( d@xmath2h@xmath3 and d@xmath1 ) also implies an increased atomic d / h ratio in the gas ( _ step 3b _ in fig .",

    "pre - stellar cores are `` deuterium fractionation factories '' .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : firstly , they are very cold ( with typical gas and dust temperatures between 7 and 13k ) .",

    "secondly , a large fraction of neutral heavy species such as co and o freeze - out onto dust grains . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : the - chem - proc ] , the disappearance of neutrals from the gas phase implies less destruction events for h@xmath1 and its deuterated forms , with consequent increase of not just h@xmath2d@xmath3 but also d@xmath2h@xmath3 and d@xmath1 .",
    "this simple combination of low temperatures and the tendency for molecules to stick on icy mantles on top of dust grains , can easily explain the observed deuterium fraction measured in pre - stellar cores .",
    "the case of formaldehyde ( h@xmath2co ) deuteration requires an extra note , as not all the data can be explained by gas - phase models including freeze - out . as discussed in @xcite , another source of deuteration",
    "is needed .",
    "a promising mechanism is the chemical processing of icy mantles ( surface chemistry ) , coupled with partial desorption of surface molecules upon formation @xcite . in particular , once co freezes out onto the surface of dust grains , it can either be stored in the ice mantles , or be `` attacked '' by reactive elements , in particular atomic hydrogen . in the latter case ,",
    "co is first transformed into hco , then formaldehyde and eventually into methanol ( ch@xmath23oh ) . in pre - stellar cores ,",
    "deuterium atoms are also abundant because of the dissociative recombination of the abundant h@xmath2d@xmath3 , d@xmath2h@xmath3 and possibly d@xmath1 ( see fig.[fig : d - chemistry - scheme ] , step 3b ) .",
    "chemical models predict d / h between 0.3 and 0.9 in the inner zones of pre - stellar cores with large co freeze - out @xcite , implying a large deuteration of formaldehyde and methanol on the surface of dust grains ( see dust grain cartoons overlaid on the bottom panel of fig.[fig : psc - fig1 ] ) .",
    "thus , the measured large deuteration of gas - phase formaldehyde in pre - stellar cores ( and possibly methanol , although this still awaits for observational evidence ) can be better understood with the contribution of surface chemistry , as a fraction of surface molecules can desorb upon formation ( thanks to their formation energy ) .",
    "class 0 sources are the youngest protostars . their luminosity is powered by the gravitational energy , namely the material falling towards the central object , accreting it at a rate of @xmath41 m@xmath42/yr .",

    "the envelope is approximatively divided in two regions , delimitated by the ice sublimation temperature ( 100120 k ) : a cold outer envelope , where molecules are more or less frozen onto the grain mantles , and an inner envelope , called hot corino , where the mantles , built up during the pre - stellar core phase (  [ sec : the - pre - stell ] ) , sublimate .",
    "this transitions occurs at distances from the center between 10 and 100 au , depending on the source luminosity .",
    "relevant to this chapter , in the hot corinos , the species formed at the pre - stellar core epoch are injected into the gas phase , bringing memory of their origin . for different reasons ,",

    "why is the d / h ratio systematically lower in solar system bodies than in pre- and proto- stellar objects ? when and how did this change occur ?",
    "_ + may be here the answer is , after all , simple .",
    "all the solar system bodies examined in this chapter ( meteorites and comets ) were originally at distances less than 20 au from the sun .",
    "the d / h measurements of all pre- and protostellar objects examined in this chapter ( pre - stellar cores , protostars and protoplanetary disks ) refer to distances larger than that , where the temperatures are lower and , consequently , the deuteration is expected to be much larger (  [ sec : the - chem - proc ] ) . therefore , this systematic difference may tell us that the psn did not undergo a global scale re - mixing of the material from the outer ( @xmath48 au ) to the inner regions .",
    "there are exceptions , though , represented by the `` hot spots '' in meteorites , which , on the contrary , may be the only representatives of this large scale re - mixing of the material in the psn .",
    "+ _ 2 . why does organic material have a systematically higher d / h value than water , regardless the object and evolutionary phase ? _ + the study of the deuterium fractionation in the pre - stellar cores (  [ sec : the - pre - stell ] ) and protostars (  [ sec : prot - phase ] ) has taught us that the formation of water and organics in different epochs is likely the reason why they have a different d / h ratio ( fig .",
    "[ fig : protostar-1 ] ) .",
    "water ices form first , when the density is relatively low ( @xmath44 cm@xmath15 ) and co not depleted yet , so that the h@xmath2d@xmath3/h@xmath1 ratio is moderate (  [ sec : the - chem - proc ] ) .",
    "organics form at a later stage , when the cloud is denser ( @xmath49 cm@xmath15 ) and co ( and other neutrals ) condenses on the grain surfaces , making possible a large enhancement of the h@xmath2d@xmath3/h@xmath1 .",
    "can this also explain , _ mutatis mutandis _",
    ", the different deuterium fractionation of water and organics measured in ccs and comets ? after all ,",
    "if the psn cooled down from a hot phase , the condensation of volatiles would follow a similar sequence : oxygen / water first , when the temperature is higher , and carbon / organics later , when the temperature is lower .",
    "this would lead to deuterium fractions lower in water than in organics , regardless whether the synthesis of water and organic was on the gas phase or on the grain surfaces . obviously , this is at the moment speculative but a road to explore , in our opinion .",
    "we emphasise that this `` different epochs formation '' hypothesis is fully compatible with the theory described in  [ sec : fract - organ ] of the origin of the organics deuteration from h@xmath2d@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "why do most comets exhibit higher d / h water values , about a factor 2 , than ccs and idps ? _ + a possible answer is that comets are formed at distances , @xmath50 au , larger than those where the ccs originate , @xmath51 au ( tab .",
    "[ tab : definitions ] ; see also  9 ) .",
    "a little more puzzling , though , is why the large majority of idps have d / h values lower than the cometary water , although at least 50% idps are predicted to be cometary fragments ( nesvorny et al .",
    "the new herschel observations of jfc indicate indeed lower d / h values than those found in occ ( tab . [",
    "tab : dcomets ] ;  [ sec : the - comets ] ) , so that the observed idps d / h values may be consistent with the cometary fragments theory . in conclusion ,",
    "the d / h distribution of ccs and idps is a powerful diagnostic to probe the distribution of their origin in the psn .",
    "+ _ 4 . why does the d / h distribution of the idps , which are thought to be fragments of comets ,",
    "mimic the ccs bulk d / h distribution ? and why is it asymmetric , namely with a shoulder towards the large d / h values ? _ + as written above , the d / h ratio distribution depends on the distribution of the original distance from where ccs and idps come from or , in other words , their parental bodies .",
    "ccs are likely fragments of asteroids from the main belt and a good fraction is of cometary origin .",
    "idps are fragments from jfc and main belt asteroids .",
    "their similar d / h distribution strongly suggests that the mixture of the two classes of objects is roughly similar , which argue for a difference between the two , more in terms of sizes than in origin .",
    "besides , the asymmetric distribution testifies that a majority of ccs and idps originate from closer to the sun parent bodies ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "why is the d / h ratio distribution of cc organics and water so different ? _ + there are in principle two possibilities : water and organics formed in different locations at the same time and then were mixed together or , on the contrary , they were formed at the same heliocentric distance but at ( slightly ) different epochs .",
    "the discussion in point 2 would favor the latter hypothesis , although this is speculative at the moment .",
    "if this is true , the d / h distribution potentially provides us with their history , namely when each of the two components formed . again , being cc organics more d - enriched than water , they were formed at later stages .",
    "there are several differences between the proto planetary disks ( ppds ) and proto solar nebula ( psn ) models .",
    "a first and major one is that psn models assume a dense and hot phase for the solar ppd .",
    "for example , temperatures higher than 1000 k persist for @xmath43 yr at 3 au and @xmath52 yr at 1 au in the yang et al .",
    "( 2013 ) model .",
    "generally , models of ppds around solar - type stars , on the contrary , never predict such high temperatures at those distances .",
    "second , ppd models consider complex chemical networks with some horizontal and vertical turbulence which modifies , though not substantially , the chemical composition across the disk . on the contrary , in psn models , chemistry networks are generally very simplified , whereas the turbulence plays a major role in the final d - enrichment across the disk . however , since the density adopted in the psn models is very high , more complex chemical networks have a limited impact @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned psn models do not explicitly compute the dust particle coagulation and migration ( if not as diffusion ) , and gas - grains decoupling whereas ( some ) disk models do ( see turner et al . and",
    "testi et al .",
    ", this volume ) .    in our opinion ,",
    "the most significant difference is the first one and the urgent question to answer is : what is the good description of the psn ? a highly turbulent , hot and diffusive disk or a cooler and likely calmer disk , as the ones we see around t tauri stars ? or something else ?",
    "the community of psn models have reasons to think that the psn disk was once hot .",
    "a major one is the measurement of depletion of moderately volatile elements ( more volatile than silicon ) in chondritic meteorites ( palme et al .",
    "1988 ) , which can be explained by dust coagulation during the cooling of an initially hot ( @xmath53 k , the sublimation temperature of silicates ) disk in the terrestrial planet formation region ( @xmath54 au ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the explanation , though , assumes that the heating of the dust at @xmath55 k was global in extent , ordered and systematic .",
    "alternatively , it is also possible that it was highly localised and , in this case , the hot initial nebula would be not necessary .",
    "for example , the so - called x - wind models assume that the hot processing occurs much closer to the star and then the matter is deposited outwards by the early solar wind @xcite . in addition , the detection of crystalline silicates in comets @xcite has been also taken as a prove that the solar system passed through a hot phase .",
    "for sure , t tau disks do not show the high temperatures ( @xmath53 k at @xmath56 au ) assumed by the psn model .",
    "these temperatures are predicted in the midplane very close ( @xmath57 au ) to the central star or in the high atmosphere of the disk , but always at distances lower than fractions of au @xcite .",
    "even the most recent models of very young and embedded ppds , with or without gravitational instabilities , predict temperatures much lower than @xmath58 k. one can ask whether the hot phase of the psn could in fact be the hot corino phase observed in class 0 sources (  [ sec : prot - phase ] ) . although the presently available facilities do not allow to probe regions of a few aus , the very rough extrapolation of the temperature profile predicted for the envelope of iras16293 - 2422 ( the prototype of class 0 sources ) by gives @xmath341000 k at a few aus .",
    "the question is , therefore : should we not compare the psn with the hot corino models rather than the protoplanetary disks models ? at present , the hot corino models are very much focused only on the @xmath59 au regions , which can be observationally probed , and only consider the gas composition .",
    "should we not start , then , considering what happens in the very innermost regions of the class 0 sources and study the dust fate too ?",
    "if so , the link with the deuterium fractionation that we observe in the hot corino phase may become much more relevant in the construction of realistic psn models .",
    "last but not least , the present psn models are based on the transport and mixing of material with different initial d / h water because of the diffusion , responsible for the angular momentum dispersion . in class 0",
    "sources , though , the dispersion of the angular momentum is thought to be mainly due to the powerful jets and outflows and not by the diffusion of inward / outward matter . moreover , during the class 0 phase , material from the cold protostellar envelope continues to rain down onto the central region and the accreting disk ( z .- y .",
    "li et al . , this volume ) , replenishing them by highly deuterated material.the resulting d / h gradient across the psn may , therefore , be different than that predicted by current theories .      several reviews discussing the origin of the terrestrial water are present in the literature , so that we will here just summarise the points emphasising the open issues .    let first remind that the water budget on earth is itself subject of debate .",
    "in fact , while the lithosphere budget is relatively easy to measure ( @xmath60 m@xmath61 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the water contained in the mantle , which contains by far the largest mass of our planet , is extremely difficult to measure and indirect probes , usually noble gases , are used for that ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with associated larger error bars .",
    "it is even more difficult to evaluate the water content of the early earth , which was likely more volatile - rich than at present .",
    "the most recent estimates give @xmath62 m@xmath61 , namely 20 times larger than the value of the lithosphere water .",
    "if the water mantle is the dominant water reservoir , as it seems to be , then the d / h value of the terrestrial oceans may be misleading if geochemical processes can alter it .",
    "evidently , measurements of the mantle water d / h is even more difficult .",
    "the last estimates suggest a value slightly lower than the terrestrial oceans water . in this chapter ,",
    "given this uncertainty on the earth bulk water content and d / h , we adopted as reference the evaporated ocean water d / h , the vswom ( tab .",
    "[ tab : definitions ] ) .",
    "the `` problem '' of the origin of the terrestrial oceans rises because , if earth was formed by planetesimals at @xmath341 au heliocentric distance , they would have been `` dry '' and no water should exist on earth .",
    "one theory , called `` late veneer '' , assumes that water was brought after earth formed by , for example , comets @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on the assumptions that the d / h cometary water is the same than the earth water d / h , but , based on observations towards comets (  [ sec : the - comets ] ) , this assumption is probably wrong .",
    "the second theory , based on the work by , assumes that a fraction of the planetesimals that built the earth came from more distant ( 24 au ) regions and were , therefore , `` wet '' .",
    "dynamical simulations of the early solar system evolution have add support to this theory , challenging at the same time the idea that the flux of late veneer comets and asteroides could have been large enough to make up the amount of water on earth .",
    "moreover , the d / h value measured in ccs (  [ sec : meteorites ] ) adds support to this theory .",
    "the recent findings by @xcite would argue for a large contribution of a group of ccs , the ci type .    in summary ,",
    "the origin of terrestrial water is still a source of intense debate .",
    "in this chapter we have established a link between the various phases in the process of solar - type star and planet formation and our solar system .",
    "this link has been metaphorically called the ariadne s thread and it is represented by the deuterium fractionation process .",
    "deuterium fractionation is active everywhere in time and space , from pre - stellar cores , to protostellar envelopes and hot corinos , to protoplanetary disks .",
    "its past activity can be witnessed by us today in comets , carbonaceous chondrites and interplanetary dust particles . trying to understand and connect this process in the various phases of star and planet formation ,",
    "while stretching the thread to our solar system , has opened new horizons in the quest of our origins .",
    "the ultimate goal is to chemically and physically connect the various phases and identify the particular route taken by our solar system .",
    "the steps toward this goal are of course many , but much will be learned just starting with the following important points :    1 .",
    "bridge the gap between pre - stellar cores and protoplanetary disks and understand how different initial conditions affect the physical and chemical structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks .",
    "2 .   study the reprocessing of material during the early stages of protoplanetary disks ; in particular , can self - gravitating accretion disks , thought to be in present in the hot corino / protostellar phase , help in understanding some of the observed chemical and physical features of more evolved protoplanetary disks and our solar system ? 3 .",
    "study the reprocessing of material ( including dust coagulation and chemical evolution of trapped ices ) throughout the protoplanetary disk evolution ; in particular , which conditions do favour the production of the organic material observed in pristine bodies of our solar - system ?",
    "4 .   compare psn models with protoplanetary disk models and include the main physical and chemical processes , in particular dust coagulation and ice mantle evolution .",
    "the future is bright thanks to the great instruments available now and in the near future ( e.g. , alma and noema , the esa rosetta mission ) and the advances in techniques used for the analysis of meteoritic material . trying to fill the d / h plot shown in fig.[fig : dh - summary ] with new observations is of course one priority , but this needs to proceed hand in hand with developments in theoretical chemistry and more laboratory work . for sure ,",
    "one lesson has been learned from this interdisciplinary work : our studies of the solar system and our studies of star / planet forming regions represent two treasures which can not be kept in two different coffers .",
    "it is now time to work together for a full exploitation of such treasures and eventually understand our astrochemical heritage . +",
