    "the cosmological constant problem is one of the most outstanding challenges in theoretical physics .",
    "the observed value of the vacuum energy density from the redshifts of distant galaxies and supernovae is bounded from above by @xmath0 ( by setting @xmath1 ) @xcite , while the change in the vacuum energy density , which is expected to occur during electroweak symmetry breaking , is @xmath2 ; raising the scale via renormalization group flow worsens the discrepancy such that the predicted change in the vacuum energy density becomes @xmath3 at the planck scale @xcite .",
    "a striking amount of fine - tuning is required in order for these scales to be matched with observations .",
    "thus , this challenge calls for any kind of a self - consistent uv completion of quantum gravity or some modifications to either gravity or quantum field theory . in this paper",
    ", we take modification of gravity ( einstein s general relavity ) at linear level ( namely the _ fierz - pauli theory _ ) , which attempts to resolve this issue . a deformation parameter ( i.e. , mass term ) to general",
    "relativity changes the gravitational potential to the yukawa - type , such that its strength decreases exponentially at large distances @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the deformation parameter , and thereby suggests a possible explanation to the tiny observed value of the cosmological constant in the universe @xcite .",
    "+ since we are interested in phyiscs in the _ far _ infrared regime and vertices in general relativity ( and modifications thereof ) , scale as @xmath6 @xcite , it is sufficient at first to consider the linearized theory and absorb the effects of the interaction in a renormalization of the parameters .",
    "this approximation is implicitly encoded from the long - ranged estimate from the previous paragraph , which can be translated into @xmath7 , where the deformation parameter @xmath5 ( the graviton mass ) is a tiny value from the observational constraint comparing to the planck scale @xcite .",
    "a problem arises when one takes the massless limit of the linearized theory , called van dam - veltman - zakarov ( vdvz ) discontinuity @xcite , which causes the discrepancy in certain experimental constraints ( deflection angle of a light beginning from stars , for expample ) . since general relativity is a non - linear theory , including the higher order terms can smoothly recover the massless limit of the spin-2 theory by the vainshtein mechanism @xcite ; the massive spin-2 theory is only applicable outside the _ vainshtein radius _ , which is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass of static source and @xmath10 is the newton s contant .",
    "that is , the vainshtein radius sets up a cutoff of the theory , and when the massless limit of the graviton is taken , the vainshtein radius becomes infinite , thereby the regime of massless spin-2 theory is recovered .",
    "furthermore , there are some cases in which the massive spin-2 theory does not suffer from the vdvz discontinuity , such as on the negatively curved maximally symmetric spacetime @xcite .",
    "+ when the degravitation effect on a generic curved background is considered , such as the theory of massive gravity on a curved background at the far infrared regime , one has to pay enough attention to its construction , especially the  covariantization \" procedure for the pauli - fierz theory @xcite . the only safe way of covariantizing the fierz - pauli theory is to include all possible terms that are not prohibited by symmetries and keep couplings to terms vanishing in a flat ( minkowski ) background as free parameters .",
    "this can only be avoided if the full model including its interactions with background geometry is known , which is not the case here .",
    "thus , one should consider not only the fierz - pauli mass term @xcite , but also terms coupling the field to the background curvature .",
    "these terms modify theoretical bounds on the allowed values of the mass .",
    "a possible way of taking this into account is to compute the vacuum persistence amplitude ( vpa ) , which is a diagnostic tool for testing unitarity of the theory .",
    "if the quantum theory at the leading order violates the unitarity condition , it is unlikely that the full theory would be able to cure the violation as far as a legitimate perturbation scheme is concerned .",
    "we pay attention to de sitter and friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) spacetimes as the given classical backgrounds in this discussion , for those are good zeroth order approximations to the universe we observe today .",
    "+ the program of testing unitarity proceeds as follows .",
    "we construct the lagrangian of the linearized massive spin-2 field on a classical background in section ii .",
    "riemann normal coordinates are used to obtain a consistent approximation scheme .",
    "results are , within this scheme , computed up to second adiabatic order .",
    "the general expression of the vpa is given in section iii , and by using the green s function derived in the previous section along with inserting a localized static external source , we evaluate the unitarity of the model .",
    "imposing unitarity gives rise to a new feature in the lower bound of the deformation parameter , and its implications are discussed in section iv .",
    "further analyses and implications to another maximally symmetric spacetime with negative curvature ( anti - de sitter ) and maximally symmetric space ( frw universe ) are discussed in the same section .",
    "lastly , more detailed calculations of the green s function are presented in the appendix section .",
    "the dynamics of the massive spin-2 theory on a curved background is obtained from the fierz - pauli action @xcite when we denote the metric of the background by @xmath11 and fluctuation around it with @xmath12 .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath13 is included as an explicit source field , and the full action is schematically given , after canonically normalizing the fluctuation field @xcite , by @xmath14\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath15 contains all quadratic terms of the massless spin-2 field @xmath16 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\equiv & \\int d^{4}x\\sqrt{-\\bar{g}}\\mathcal{l}_{0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 .",

    "we expect it to be of order one .",
    "there are several additional ways to couple the ricci ( or riemann ) tensor to the fluctuation field , but all of them are reduced down to this expression for a maximally symmetric background .",

    "inclusion of the deformation term , along with the non - minimal coupling term , seemingly breaks the gauge symmetry of the theory ( general covarince ) , but this seemingly broken symmetry can be restored by the stckelberg formalism just as shown in the massive spin-1 case of the electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "that is , there exists a new set of symmetries in the linearized massive spin-2 theory by introducing ",
    "stckelberg vector and scalar fields \" .",
    "the rest of the terms in @xmath24 with cubic orders or higher are included in @xmath25 $ ] , and our interest is only on the first two terms on the right hand side of the eq .",
    "( [ full action ] ) .",
    "+ historically , the action of a massive spin-2 field was obtained from einstein s general relativity .",
    "the idea was to simply take the einstein - hilbert action and expand it to leading order in small fluctuations around a given background ( which in turn solves the full non - linear problem ) .",
    "more explicity , the action of the massless spin-2 theory on a classical background is derived by the perturbative expansion of general relativity , @xmath26 along with taking canonical normalization of the field . including the terms up to second order in the metric fluctuation @xmath27 yields the minimally - coupled ( @xmath28 )",
    "linearized massless spin-2 theory @xcite .",
    "then , the fierz - pauli mass term was added by hand to the leading order in fluctuations . from the context of effective field theories ,",
    "this procedure leaves a lot to be desired , as this approach does not generate the term proportional to @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ linear action ] ) .",
    "while the result is a consistent theory ( at least to leading order ) in its own , it is not the most general action compatible with all symmetries given . instead , if einstein s general relativity is to be modified , all allowed terms should be taken into account .",
    "+ hence , the full expression of the linearized action for the massive spin-2 theory at the weak - field limit , with an external source added , is summarized as @xmath29 = \\int d^{4}x\\sqrt{-\\bar{g}}[\\mathcal{l}_{0 } + \\mathcal{l}_{m } + h_{\\mu\\nu}t^{\\mu\\nu}],\\ ] ] and the equations of motion are derived by taking a variation of the action with respect to the fluctuation field @xmath30 in which @xmath31 is a sum of the kinetic operator and curvature contribution to the massless part . since the massless spin-2 theoy has two transversal modes , @xmath31 is a transverse projection operator , and the bianchi identiy ( by taking a convariant derivative on the equations of motion ) imposes four constraints @xmath32 with @xmath33 being a covariant derivative in the curved background .",
    "a commutation relation in the covariant derivatives has to be found in order to use these constraints , which is @xmath34h^{\\sigma}_{\\rho } & = & \\bar{\\mathcal{r}}_{\\lambda\\alpha}h^{\\lambda}_{\\rho } - \\bar{\\mathcal{r}}_{\\lambda\\rho\\sigma\\alpha}h^{\\lambda\\sigma } \\\\",

    "the equations of motion with five independent components are derived by using this commutation relation and the constraints given above , and taking the trace out ( for @xmath24 is a non - dynamical degree of freedom ) @xmath35\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "let us denote this relation by @xmath38 .",
    "it is schematically solved by @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the convolution ) where @xmath41 is the green s function .",
    "since it is difficult to construct a green s function globally , we compute it only in its adiabatic expansion . to do so , first the correct vacuum ( another difficult issue on general backgrounds ) has to be identified .",
    "this can be done consistently in an adiabatic expansion .",
    "the concept of a `` unique '' vacuum state on a generic classical background is ambiguous due to general covariance @xcite .",
    "quantum field theory in flat spacetime is constructed upon the `` unanimous '' notion of vacuum : a physically unambiguous vacuum state with respect to one inertial reference frame is also a vacuum in the other inertial reference frames because there exists a preferred global timelike killing vector field @xmath42 in the poincre group , which is orthogonal to the spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "that is , when the mode expansion is taken on the solution to the equations of motion for a quantum field in flat spacetime , a basis is chosen such that the solution is unique up to a phase because of the timelike killing vector field .",
    "as the symmetry of the background is changed from poincar invariance to general covariance , however , we do not have such a preferred killing vector , for the manifold is coordinate independent ; there exists several different killing equations @xcite so that the notion of `` preferred '' basis is no longer available on a curved background .",
    "for instance , when asymptotic  in \" ( for @xmath43 ) and  out \" ( for @xmath44 ) states are defined in the expanding universe , the basis of mode expansions for the asymptotic states are non - trivially related by the bogoliubov transformation @xcite .",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the particle number operator is not necessarily equal to zero if the  in \" state number operator is evaluated with respect to the  out \" vacuum and vice versa , thereby a unique particle interpretation is lacking @xcite .",
    "+ however , an approximate vacuum state can still be defined by imposing certain constraints on the background .",
    "it is well - known for a slowly varying ( or expanding ) frw universe that one can solve the equations motion by wkb approximation @xcite . in the case of a massive scalar field theory in the frw universe",
    ", the slowly varying background implies that the period of the harmonic oscillator is much smaller than an adiabatic parameter , which we call @xmath45 , and this parameter can be chosen as the hubble time @xmath46 . in other words ,",
    "we take the wkb approximation to the solution based on an assumption that the wavelength of the scalar particle is much smaller than the curvature scale of the universe , @xmath47 , and thereby the asymptotic  in \" and  out \" states are defined just as in the flat spacetime .",
    "the approximation scheme in this paper is up to second adiabatic order , and its corresponding vacuum state is the second adiabatic one @xmath48 @xcite . +",
    "this approximation scheme becomes more explicit by a particular choice of the coordinate system of the background .",
    "we employ riemann normal coordinate ( or a local inertial frame ) , centered at @xmath49 .",
    "the metric is then given by @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 and the spacetime indices are raised and lowered by the flat metric @xmath52 .",
    "we can rewrite the expansion scheme shown above as @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) if the background is chosen to be the maximally symmetric spacetime .",
    "in other words , we consider a small region around an arbitrary origin @xmath49 .",
    "this region is much smaller than the surface of hubble sphere with radius @xmath55 , and thus is well approximated by small corrections to minkowski . the vacuum structure , in particular , is very similar to that of fluctuations around minkowski spacetime . since the curvature scale @xmath13 is a fixed value in the maximally symmetric spacetime , the approximation up to second adiabatic order means that only the terms up to the quadratic order in @xmath56 are to be included in the action .",
    "the de sitter metric and its inverse metric in the normal neighberhood are given below @xmath57 from which the christoffel symbol and riemann tensor are computed accordingly .",
    "+ with this power counting scheme , we can expand the left hand side of the equation of motion up to the second adiabatic order as follows @xmath58 in which the convention for symmetrization is without factor of 1/2 .",

    "however , the feynman parameter does not suffer from hitting poles due to the domain of the integrand , @xmath124 , so that we can perform the same unitarity analysis on this amplitude as in the previous section .",
    "the mass bound of the spin-2 field comes from the positivity of the coefficient of the leading order term @xmath125 and the lower bound to the mass is ruled out by the similar reasoning given the previous section . this mass bound looks again non - trivially related to the background curvature when the coupling strength is set to equal to one .",
    "we can constrain this value within a range @xmath126 , and the mass squared is again bounded from below by a negative quantity .",
    "notice that the massive spin-2 field at the linear level is weakly coupled to the background geometry and that , if the coupling strength is adjusted in the de sitter spacetime , the same theory is to be held in the anti - de sitter spacetime with the similar coupling constant , given that both are proper solutions to the massive gravity .",
    "this compatibility between the two maximally symmetric spacetimes suggests the restriction on the value of the coupling between 1/6 and 1/7 in such a way that the constant becomes slightly greater than ( or equal to ) 1/6 when the background has a positive curvature and it is slightly smaller than 1/7 if the background has a negative curvature .",
    "imagine a free massive graviton is propagating in the de sitter background , and all of a sudden , the background is locally changed into the anti - de sitter spacetime due to the presence of a source , such as a black hole @xcite .",
    "the same graviton is also to be freely propagating in this background regardless of its curvature , and these two bounds of the coupling constant ensure the safety of the graviton in the maximally symmetric spacetimes .",
    "had the mass had a certain forbidden region , as is claimed in @xcite , the quantum description of the graviton with a fixed value of the mass is to be broken down by the unitarity violation , when it enters another region of the constant curvature whose magnitude is greater than the graviton mass .",
    "this violation implies that either the background is unstable , the degrees of freedom are altered by the change of the background , inclusion of the higher order terms might restore the unitarity , or the unitarity can be restored in some other ways . in any case , the effective description is to be modified in some way or the other when the unitarity violation occurs .      the unitarity analysis given above",
    "is slightly modified when the background is generalized from maximal symmetry in spacetime merely to space , such as a homogeneous and isotropic universe ( friedmann - robertson - walker or frw universe in short ) .",
    "recall the relation between the normal coordinates ( or the wavelength of graviton ) @xmath56 and the hubble time @xmath127 , for a time parameter in frw universe is @xmath128 .",
    "the hubble parameter is a constant value in de sitter and anti - de sitter spacetimes , but it becomes a time - dependent parameter in the comoving frame once the spacetime symmetry is abandoned ; i.e. , @xmath129 is the adiabatic parameter .",
    "when the universe is assumed to be spatially flat , which is what we are observing today @xcite , and its expansion rate is slow ( @xmath130 ) , the adiabatic parameter can also be written in terms of the curvature scalar @xmath131 which clearly differs from de sitter ( or anti - de sitter ) case such that the ricci scalar is now time dependent .",
    "slow expansion ( @xmath130 ) of the universe implies that the significant expansion takes place in the time span much larger than the hubble time ) , so that we can mimic the similar analysis in the maximally symmetric spacetimes , for the curvature scalar is almost a constant in the normal neighborhood region .",
    "therefore , the mass bound in frw universe naturally arises when unitarity is imposed @xmath132 and this agrees with the literature @xcite , when the coupling strength is minimal .",
    "this bound seemingly runs due to the time dependence of the hubble parameter . we can treat the hubble parameter as a constant in this context if the local region of the spacetime is restricted enough , and conclude that the mass bound is again absent in the slowly expanding and spatially flat frw universe .",
