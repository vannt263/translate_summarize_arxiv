    "in relativistic heavy ion collisions at rhic , heavy quarks ( charm , @xmath2 , or bottom , @xmath1 ) are expected to be primarily created from initial hard parton scatterings  @xcite and carry information from the system at an early stage .",
    "the interaction between heavy quarks and the medium is sensitive to the medium dynamics , therefore heavy quarks are suggested as an ideal probe to quantify the properties of the strongly interacting qcd matter .",
    "heavy quark production has been studied by the phenix experiment via the measurement of electrons from semi - leptonic decays of hadrons carrying charm ( noted @xmath2 ) or bottom ( noted @xmath1 ) quarks . a large suppression and",
    "strong elliptic flow of single electron heavy flavor has been observed in au+au collisions at  200gev  @xcite .",
    "this suppression is found to be similar to that of light mesons which implies a substantial energy loss of fast heavy quarks while traversing the medium .",
    "the strong flow implies that the same heavy quarks are in fact sensitive to the pressure gradients driving hydrodynamic flow  giving new insight into the strongly coupled nature of the qgp fluid at these temperatures . for these earlier results ,",
    "phenix was not able to distinguish electrons from @xmath2 and @xmath1 quarks . in order to understand medium effects in more detail , it became imperative to directly measure the nuclear modification , and the flow , of @xmath2 and @xmath1 separately .",
    "based on this motivation , in december 2010 , the phenix collaboration opened a new era for measuring heavy flavor at rhic by installing a new detector called the silicon vertex tracker ( vtx ) .",
    "the new vtx detector benefits three areas for phenix heavy flavor measurements .",
    "first , by selecting electrons with a distance of closest approach ( dca ) to the primary vertex larger than @xmath12100@xmath13 m , the photonic electron background is suppressed by orders of magnitude .",
    "this suppression results in a clean and robust measurement of heavy flavor production in the single electron channel .",
    "secondly , as the lifetime of mesons containing bottom is significantly longer than those containing charm , the detailed dca distribution from the vtx allows to disentangle charm from bottom production over a broad  range .",
    "thirdly , a dca cut to remove hadrons reduces the combinatorial background of @xmath14 such that a direct measurement of @xmath15 mesons through this decay channel will be possible . in this paper , we present the first phenix measurements using the vtx to measure the dca of electrons at midrapidity . from this",
    ", the yield ratio of single electrons from bottom to those from all heavy flavor , as well as the nuclear modification factor of charm and bottom separately , are presented using minimum - bias ( mb )  and  collisions at  200gev obtained in the 2011 and 2012 rhic runs .",

    "the central detector was upgraded to include the vtx ready for run 2011 .",
    "starting from the beam line , the complete detector now comprises the new vtx , which is followed by another tracker system made of two sets of drift chambers and a pad chamber ( pc1 ) .",
    "outside of the pc1 detector is a ring image cherenkov detector ( rich ) , which provides electron / hadron separation from  of a few hundred  mev/@xmath2 to about 5gev/@xmath2 .",

    "the vtx was commissioned in run 2011 using  collision data at @xmath18=500gev .",
    "commissioning was followed by a period of data collection , which forms the basis of the physics measurements presented here , in 2011 ( for ) and 2012 ( for ) rhic runs .",

    "the amount of hadron contamination was determined using the rich swap method  a standard procedure of phenix electron analyses  @xcite .",
    "the dca distributions of the photonic components ( dalitz , photon conversion ) are gaussian distributions , which was confirmed with a full geant simulation of the phenix detector .",
    "we additionally studied the effect of high multiplicities ( expected in  collisions ) on the dca distribution by embedding simulated electrons and pions in real  data .",
    "this study indicated that the effect on the dca due to the high occupancy is small and justifies the use of a pure gaussian distribution as the shape of the photonic component .",
    "the dca distribution shape of the @xmath2 , @xmath1 , and  decay components were determined by simulation .",

    "the  background normalization is determined from the number of charged hadrons in the same  bin , the measured on @xmath28 ratio , the branching ratios of , and a simulation of  decays .",
    "there are additional backgrounds at large dca in the data that are caused by conversion electrons in the outer vtx layers . in low multiplicity events ,",
    "these outer layer conversions are removed by the requirement of hits in the first two barrels b0 and b1 of the vtx . however , in  collisions , some of these conversions are confirmed by random hits in the vtx . since they are caused by random matching with unrelated hits in the vtx , their dca distribution is broad , almost flat .",
