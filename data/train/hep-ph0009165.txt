    "the crucial problem of practical importance is the _ existence _ or _ nonexistence _ of the feynman scalling , which says that @xmath1-spectra of secondaries are energy independent . because in cosmic ray applications one is sensitive essentially to large @xmath1 region ( of , say , @xmath2 )",
    ", the commonly used formula @xcite @xmath3 stresses this fact by power - like form with exponent obtained from the @xmath4 limit of fragmentation data @xcite . here",
    "@xmath5 is parameter responsible for the feynman scaling violation whereas @xmath6 and @xmath7 are additional parameters obtained from the fit to data - all are energy dependent ( cf .",

    "we shall demonstrate that ( [ eq : ao ] ) emerges in natural way from the information theory approach to hadronization processes presented in @xcite and extended to allow for the possible nonextensivity of the hadronization process by applying tsallis entropy @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for details of notion of nonextensivity and @xcite for its application to high energy reactions . ) .",
    "in order to describe the hadronization process in information theory one uses @xcite the _ least biased and most plausible _ single particle distribution @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is rapidity ) resulting from hadronization process in which a mass @xmath10 hadronizes into @xmath11 secondaries of mean transverse mass @xmath12 each ( for simplicity we consider only one - dimensional hadronization with limited transverse momenta which can , however , depend on @xmath10 and @xmath11 )",
    ". this is done maximalizing the shannon ( or boltzmann - gibbs ) information entropy , @xmath13 , under constraints of normalization ( @xmath14 ) and energy conservation ( @xmath15 ) , which leads to the following ( extensive ) distribution function cf .",

    "( [ eq : maxent ] ) as a `` thermodynamical parametrizations '' with inverse `` temperature '' @xmath20 beeing a free , positively defined parameter . in @xcite it was shown that , in a wide range of energies and multiplicities , @xmath21 .",
    "however , the comparison with data can not be done in such model independent way because of the fluctuations of inelasticity @xmath22 ( given by inelasticity distribution @xmath23 @xcite ) causing fluctuations of @xmath10 and because of fluctuations of number of particles @xmath24 produced from a mass @xmath10 given by multiparticle distribution @xmath25 @xcite ( its actual shape accounts here for the possible multisource structure of the production process ) .",

    "the experimentally observed variation of @xmath54 with energy has also been accounted for by using the following simple interpolation formula : @xmath55 gev .",
    "the results are reasonable , especially for @xmath56 and @xmath57 gev . for higher energies",
    "our distributions start to be broader than data and this can not be improved by changing @xmath35 as diminishing its value in order to make distributions narrower will spoil the agreement with data for small rapidities .",

    "notice that for @xmath66 one obtains an increase of particle densities in the central region connected with its decrease at the edges of rapidity range - clearly resembling the characteristic pattern of feynman scaling violation .",
    "we have replaced therefore the `` exact '' formula , ( [ eq : full ] ) by a one parameter fit represented by ( [ eq : form ] ) where @xmath35 summarizes the action of the averaging over the fluctuations caused by the initial conditions of reaction represented by the inelasticity and multiplicity distributions .",
    "we find it very amazing that such simple approach coincides practically with empirical formula ( [ eq : ao ] ) and with only one parameter @xmath35 describes fairly well all data .",
    "notice that @xmath53 is not very far from @xmath67 , which gives power @xmath68 in ( [ eq : ao ] ) .",
    "notice also that our general formula allows for description of small @xmath1 region as well",
    ". it would certainly be interesting to connect @xmath35 directly to the parameters describing inelasticity and multiplicity distributions or to descriptions of leading particles , for example of the type of that presented in @xcite .",
    "our results seem to indicate that most probably parameter @xmath35 should be @xmath1-dependent reflecting different character of fluctuations of the quantity @xmath69 @xcite in the central ( mostly pionization ) and fragmentation regions .",
