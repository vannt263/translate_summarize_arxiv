    "since 1989 , the bosonic hubbard model ( see refs . and references therein ) has attracted continued interest due to its very rich ground state phase diagram and large opportunities of a direct experimental realization in systems of ultracold bosonic atoms loaded in optical lattices .",
    "such systems offer unique opportunities for studying strongly correlated quantum matter in a highly controllable environment .",
    "the hamiltonian of the extended bosonic hubbard model ( ebhm ) is usually defined as follows @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 are , respectively , the boson creation , annihilation , and number operators at the lattice site @xmath5 .",
    "the boson transfer amplitudes are given by @xmath6 ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 parametrize the coulomb repulsions between bosons resting at the same and different sites . while @xmath6 causes the bosons to delocalize , promoting a superfluid ( sf ) phase at weak interactions ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath8 tend to stabilize the conventional mott insulator ( mi ) and the density wave ( dw ) phases when the interaction dominates over the hopping energy scale set by @xmath10 .",
    "attractive on - site boson - boson interactions allow for the formation of dimers , or bound states of two bosons .",
    "the phase diagram then contains the conventional one - boson superfluid ( 1-bs ) with nonvanishing order parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 and dimer superfluid ( 2-bs ) phase .",
    "the 2-bs phase is characterized by the vanishing of the one - boson order parameter ( @xmath13 ) but nonzero pairing correlation ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "apart from the above local order parameters , one can use superfluid stiffness to identify the superfluid states .",
    "it is worth noting , the thermal transitions between the 2-bs dimer superfluid and the 1-bs normal fluid are considered in ref",
    "..    when the inter - site boson - boson repulsion is turned on , in addition to the uniform mott insulating state and two superfluid phases , a dimer checkerboard solid state appears at unit filling , where boson pairs form a solid with checkerboard structure .",
    "our starting point for theoretical analysis of the 2d extended bose hubbard model will assume truncation of the on - site hilbert space to the three lowest occupation states n = 0 , 1 , 2 with further mapping of the ebhm hamiltonian to an anisotropic spin-1 model ( see , e.g. , refs . ) .",
    "the simplest effective spin-1 model hamiltonian is @xmath14 @xmath15    in this space the dw phase corresponds to an antiferromagnetic ordering of the pseudospins in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "the mi ground state , on the other hand , includes a large amplitude of the state with @xmath17 on every site with small admixture of states containing tightly bound particle - hole fluctuations ( @xmath18 on nearby sites ) .",
    "the phase can be termed as a quantum paramagnet .",
    "the 1-bs and 2-bs superfluid phases correspond to dipole and quadrupole ( nematic ) pseudospin xy - order , respectively .",
    "generally speaking , one may anticipate the emergence of so - called supersolid phases , or mixed 1-bs+dw ( 2-bs+dw ) phases .    in this paper , we do consider the most general form of the effective s=1 pseudospin hamiltonian related with the extended bose - hubbard model and present a short overview of different phase states .",
    "we focus on several types of unconventional skyrmion - like topological structures in 2d boson systems , which have not been analysed till now .",
    "the structures are characterized by a complicated interplay of insulating and two superfluid phases .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "sec.ii is devoted to introduction into the pseudospin formalism , in sec.iii we introduce and analyse the effective pseudospin hamiltonian . in sec.iv",
    "we turn to a short overview of a typical simplified s=1 spin model .",
    "unconventional pseudospin topological structures are considered in sec.v with a short conclusion in sec.vi .",
    "one strategy to handle with the physics of the extended bose - hubbard model with the truncated on - site hilbert space @xmath19 is to make use of a s=1 pseudospin formalism@xcite and to create model pseudospin hamiltonian that can reasonably well reproduce both the ground state and important low - energy excitations of the full problem .",
    "standard pseudospin formalism represents a variant of the equivalent operators technique widely known in different physical problems from classical and quantum lattice gases , binary alloys , ( anti)ferroelectrics , .. to neural networks . the formalism starts with a finite basis set for a lattice site ( triplet in our model ) .",
    "such an approach differs from well - known pseudospin - particle transformations akin jordan - wigner@xcite or holstein - primakoff@xcite transformation which establish a strict linkage between pseudospin operators and the creation / annihilation operators of the fermi or bose type .",
    "the pseudospin formalism generally proceeds with a truncated basis and does not imply a strict relation to boson operators that obey the bosonic commutation rules .",
    "the three on - site fock states @xmath20 can be addressed to form a local hilbert space of the semi - hard core bosons which can be mapped onto a system of s = 1 centers via a generalization of the matsubara - matsuda transformation@xcite that also maps the boson density into the local magnetization : @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast to the hard - core bosons associated with s = 1/2 magnets , it is possible to study `` hubbard - like '' bosonic gases with on - site density - density ( contact ) interactions because @xmath22 .",
    "hereafter , we associate the three on - site fock states with the occupation numbers @xmath19 with the three components of the @xmath23 pseudo - spin ( isospin ) triplet with @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "it is worth noting that very similar s=1 pseudospin formalism was suggested recently@xcite to describe the triplet of cu@xmath25 , cu@xmath26 , cu@xmath27 valence states in copper high - temperature superconductors .",
    "the @xmath23 spin algebra includes the three independent irreducible tensors @xmath28 of rank @xmath29 with one , three , and five components , respectively , obeying the wigner - eckart theorem @xcite @xmath30 here we make use of standard symbols for the wigner coefficients and reduced matrix elements . in a more conventional cartesian scheme a complete set of",
    "the non - trivial pseudo - spin operators would include both @xmath31 and a number of symmetrized bilinear forms @xmath32 , or spin - quadrupole operators , which are linearly coupled to @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively @xmath35 @xmath36    instead of the three @xmath37 states one may use the cartesian basis set @xmath38 , or @xmath39 : @xmath40 so that an on - site wave function can be written in the matrix form as follows@xcite : @xmath41 with @xmath42 . obviously , the minimal number of dynamic variables describing an isolated on - site @xmath23 ( pseudo)spin center equals to four , however , for a more general situation , when the ( pseudo)spin system represents only the part of the bigger system , and we are forced to consider the coupling with the additional degrees of freedom , one should consider all the five non - trivial parameters .",
    "the pseudospin matrix has a very simple form within the @xmath39 basis set : @xmath43    we start by introducing the following set of s=1 coherent states characterized by vectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 satisfying the normalization constraint@xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are real vectors that are arbitrarily oriented with respect to some fixed coordinate system in the pseudospin space with orthonormal basis @xmath49 .    the two vectors are coupled , so that the minimal number of dynamic variables describing the @xmath23 ( pseudo)spin system appears to be equal to four .",
    "hereafter we would like to emphasize the @xmath50 nature of the @xmath51 vector field : @xmath52 and @xmath53 describe the physically identical states .",
    "it should be noted that in real space the @xmath52 state corresponds to a quantum on - site superposition @xmath54 existence of such unconventional on - site superpositions is a principal point of the model .",
    "below instead of @xmath44 and @xmath45 we will make use of a pair of unit vectors @xmath55 and @xmath56 , defined as follows@xcite : @xmath57    for the averages of the principal pseudospin operators we obtain @xmath58\\,;\\ ] ] @xmath59 or @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62        one should note a principal difference between the @xmath63 and @xmath23 quantum systems .",
    "the only on - site order parameter in the former case is an average spin moment @xmath64 , whereas in the latter one has five additional `` spin - quadrupole '' , or spin - nematic order parameters described by traceless symmetric tensors @xmath65 interestingly , that in a sense , the @xmath63 quantum spin system is closer to a classic one ( @xmath66 ) with all the order parameters defined by a simple on - site vectorial order parameter @xmath67 than the @xmath23 quantum spin system with its eight independent on - site order parameters .",
    "the operators @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) change the @xmath16-projection of the pseudospin and transform the @xmath70 state into the @xmath71 one .",
    "in other words , these can change the occupation number .",
    "it should be emphasized that for the @xmath23 pseudospin algebra there are two operators : @xmath72 and @xmath73 , or @xmath74 and @xmath75 that change the pseudo - spin projection ( and occupation number ) by @xmath76 , with slightly different properties @xmath77 but @xmath78 it is worth noting the similar behavior of the both operators under the hermitian conjugation : @xmath79 ; @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath81 , or @xmath82 operator changes the pseudo - spin projection by @xmath83 with the local order parameter @xmath84 @xmath85 obviously , this on - site off - diagonal order parameter is nonzero only when both @xmath86 and @xmath87 are nonzero , or for the on - site @xmath88 superpositions .",
    "it is worth noting that the @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) operator creates an on - site boson pair , or dimer , with a kinematic constraint @xmath91=0 , that underlines its `` hard - core '' nature .",

    "<S> we have focused in the paper on the most prominent and intensively studied s=1 pseudospin formalism for extended bosonic hubbard model ( ehbm ) with truncation of the on - site hilbert space to the three lowest occupation states n = 0 , 1 , 2 . the ehbm hamiltonian is a paradigmatic model for the highly topical field of ultracold gases in optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> generalized non - heisenberg effective pseudospin hamiltonian does provide a deep link with boson system and physically clear description of `` the myriad of phases '' from uniform mott insulating phases and density waves to two types of superfluids and supersolids . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the 2d pseudospin system is prone to a topological phase separation and focus on several types of unconventional skyrmion - like topological structures in 2d boson systems , which have not been analysed till now . </S>",
    "<S> the structures are characterized by a complicated interplay of insulating and the two superfluid phases with a single boson and two - boson condensation , respectively . </S>"
