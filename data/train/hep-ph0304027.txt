    "<S> decays of the kind @xmath0  and @xmath1  allow us to probe @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , involving the angle @xmath4 of the unitarity triangle and the @xmath5@xmath6 mixing phases @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) . analysing these modes in a phase - convention - independent way , we find that their mixing - induced observables are affected by a subtle @xmath9 factor , where @xmath10 denotes the angular momentum of the @xmath11 decay products , and derive bounds on @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we emphasize that `` untagged '' rates are an important ingredient for efficient determinations of weak phases , not only in the presence of a sizeable width difference @xmath13 ; should @xmath14 be sizeable , the combination of `` untagged '' with `` tagged '' @xmath0  observables provides an elegant and _ unambiguous _ extraction of @xmath15 , whereas the `` conventional '' determination of @xmath16 is affected by an eightfold discrete ambiguity . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we propose a _ combined _ analysis of @xmath0  and @xmath17  modes , which has important advantages , offering various interesting new strategies to extract @xmath4 in an essentially unambiguous manner .    </S>",
