    "we present results of the coupled - channel analysis of data on processes @xmath1 in the @xmath2 sector and on the @xmath3 scattering in the @xmath4 sector .",
    "our knowledge about the existence and parameters of resonances in the @xmath7 sector is not clear yet .",
    "nine from the thirteen resonances , discussed in the pdg issue @xcite and in the literature @xcite , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , must be still confirmed in various experiments and analyses . in the analysis of processes @xmath17 @xcite five resonances ",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath19 and @xmath20  have been obtained , where the @xmath13 is a candidate for the glueball . in our analysis of @xmath1",
    "@xcite we supported this conclusion on the @xmath13 .",
    "the tensor sector is also interesting because here multi - quark states might be observed apparently as separate states , which are difficult to observe in the scalar sector where owing to their large widths these states can manifest themselves only in a distortion of the @xmath21 picture .",
    "investigation in the @xmath22 sector is motivated by those results @xcite in the @xmath7 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 sectors , which ( if they are confirmed ) will require revisions of the mainstream quark models , e.g. @xcite , and by a possibility to support ( or not ) these results when studying of other mesonic sectors .",
    "these are the earlier obtained disagreements with predictions of the indicated model , e.g. , with respect to the @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the scalar sector and to the second @xmath21 nonet in the tensor sector @xcite .",
    "especially it is worth to remind that result in the vector sector : in our multi - channel analysis @xcite of the @xmath27-wave @xmath3 scattering data @xcite and in the re - analysis of the process @xmath28 @xcite , the old conclusion @xcite was confirmed ( which , to the point , is consistent with results of some quark models @xcite ) that the first @xmath29-like meson is @xmath30 unlike @xmath31 cited in the pdg tables @xcite .",
    "however , existence of both states does not contradict to the @xmath3 scattering data @xcite .",
    "it is important that for both states there are apparently possible su(3 ) partners . for the @xmath30",
    "these partners are : the isodoublet @xmath32 and the isoscalar @xmath33 , for which the obtained mass is in range 1350 - 1460  mev @xcite , whereas the gell - mann  okubo ( gm - o ) formula @xmath34 gives for the mass of the eighth component of corresponding octet the value about 1460  mev .",
    "the @xmath31 , which might be the isovector @xmath35 state in the @xmath21 picture , could be put into the octet together with the isodoublet @xmath36 .",
    "then from the gm - o formula , the value 1750  mev is obtained for the mass of the eighth component of this octet .",
    "this corresponds to one of the observations of the second @xmath37-like meson which is cited in the pdg tables under the @xmath38 and has the mass , obtained in various works , from 1606 to 1840  mev .    in the mainstream quark model @xcite , the first @xmath29-like meson",
    "is usually predicted by about 200  mev higher than the @xmath30 , and also the first @xmath39-like meson is obtained at 1580  mev , whereas the corresponding well established resonance has the mass of about 1410  mev .",
    "therefore , it is important to check if the conclusion on the @xmath30 is supported by investigation in other mesonic sectors . considering the @xmath40-plot for the daughter @xmath29-trajectory , related to the suggested @xmath30 ,",
    "one concludes that there should exist the @xmath4-state at about 1950  mev ``@xmath41 '' .",
    "it is worth to check this state analyzing accessible data on the @xmath42-wave @xmath3 scattering @xcite .    in the present investigation",
    ", we applied the multi - channel @xmath0-matrix approach @xcite . to generate resonance poles and zeros on the riemann surface",

    "the n - channel @xmath0-matrix is determined on the @xmath43-sheeted riemann surface .",
    "the matrix elements @xmath44   ( @xmath45 denote channels ) have the right - hand cuts along the real axis of the complex-@xmath46 plane ( @xmath46 is the invariant total energy squared ) , related to the considered channels and starting in the channel thresholds @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , and the left - hand cuts related to the crossed channels .",
    "the main model - independent part of resonance contributions is given by poles and zeros on the riemann surface .",
    "generally , this representation of resonances can be obtained utilizing formulas for the analytic continuations of the matrix elements for the coupled processes to the unphysical sheets of the riemann surface , as it was performed for the n - channel case in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work ,",
    "the le couteur  newton relations @xcite are used to generate the resonance poles and zeros on the riemann surface .",
    "these relations express the @xmath0-matrix elements of all coupled processes in terms of the jost matrix determinant @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) that is a real analytic function with the only branch - points at @xmath51 : @xmath52 the real analyticity implies   @xmath53 .",

    "this means that only on these sheets the pole positions of resonances are at the same points of the @xmath46-plane , as the resonance zeros on the physical sheet , i.e. , they are not shifted due to the coupling of channels .",

    "* as to the @xmath13 , the presence of the @xmath14 in the analysis with eleven resonances helps to interpret @xmath13 as the glueball . in the case of ten resonances ,",

    "finally we have @xmath8 and @xmath116 which are neither @xmath21 states nor glueballs .",
    "since one predicts that masses of the lightest @xmath133 hybrids are bigger than those of lightest glueballs , these states might be the 4-quark ones .",
    "then for the isodoublet mass of the corresponding nonet , we would expect the value 1570 - 1600 mev .",
    "for now we do not know any experimental indications for the tensor isodoublet of that mass .",
    "however , in the known experimental spectrum of the @xmath134 family , there is a 500-mev unoccupied gap from 1470 to 1970  mev @xcite , except for the above work @xcite .",
    "moreover , as one can see in the pdg tables on the @xmath135 listing , widths of the observed isovector tensor states in the 1660 - 1775-mev interval differ by the factor 2 - 3 , i.e. , the states possess various properties .",
    "for example , the broad state with mass @xmath136  mev and width @xmath137   mev , observed in @xmath138 @xcite , might be the isovector member of the corresponding four - quark nonet .",
    "+ of course , an assumption of this possibility presupposes an existence of the scalar tetraquarks at lower energies @xcite which are not seen in our analysis @xcite .",
    "one can argue that these states are a part of the background due to their very large widths . *",
    "the analysis of the @xmath42-wave @xmath3 scattering data by b.  hyams et al .",
    "@xcite indicates that , except for the known @xmath102 ( in our analysis @xmath139  mev , @xmath140  mev ) , there might be one more state lying above 1830  mev .",
    "since the @xmath3 scattering data above 1890  mev are absent , it is impossible to say something conclusive on parameters of this state .",
    "however , the @xmath41 does not contradict to the data but instead improves a little bit the obtained parameters of the @xmath102 and its branching ratios when comparing them with the pdg tables @xcite .",
