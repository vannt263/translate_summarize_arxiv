    "an observation that hall effect in the mixed state can have a sign opposite to that in the normal state has been reported for some conventional superconductor since 1960th .",
    "the discovery of a hall effect sign change in the most of high - t@xmath11 cuprate superconductors @xcite stimulated a new interest to this anomalous behavior .",
    "the high - t@xmath11 superconductors are strongly type ii and thus , in accordance with the theory of abrikosov , in the mixed state their physical properties are determined by the presence of quantized flux lines or vortices .",
    "when an external current @xmath12 is applied to the vortex system , the flux lines start to move under the action of the lorentz force @xmath13 = @xmath12 @xmath14 @xmath15 with a velocity @xmath16 . as a consequence an electric field @xmath17",
    "= -@xmath16 @xmath14 @xmath15 is induced which has resistivity component @xmath18 and hall component @xmath19 , the longitudinal resistivity , @xmath20 = @xmath18/@xmath21 and hall resistivity @xmath22 = @xmath19/@xmath21 , thus appear .",
    "classical models which considered the hydrodynamical motion of vortices in response to a transport current in homogeneous structures ( flux - flow models ) were created at 1960th @xcite . in particular , bardeen and stephen",
    "( bs)@xcite have found that in the mixed state a part of the current flows through the vortex core that results in both dissipation and hall effect .",
    "the core is treated as a normal conductor and thus in this model the hall effect should have the same sign as in the normal state .",
    "various theoretical models have been proposed to explain the sign change of the hall resistivity in the mixed state ( for an extensive review see @xcite ) but the origin of this phenomenon remains controversial .    if the proper pinning forces are included in the equation of vortex motion @xcite it leads to a back - flow current and to a possibility of hall effect sign reversal . however ,",
    "pinning forces are highly sample dependent and thus difficult to analyze .    among the other models for the explanation of the hall effect sign change in the mixed state",
    "a two - band model was created by hirsh and marsiglio ( hm ) @xcite with electrons and holes supposed to have rather different superconducting gaps .",
    "such a model will suggest a simple and natural explanation of the phenomenon but only if there are grounds to consider that two types of carriers , namely , electrons and holes , really coexist in the systems studied .",
    "there are much recent activities in investigation of possible electrons and holes coexistence in the normal state of cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "in particular , in electron - doped superconducting cuprates , angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite@xmath23@xcite and transport studies @xcite@xmath23@xcite have shown that both electrons and holes play a role in the normal state properties .",
    "two kinds of carriers in electron - doped cuprates with different lanthanide cations seem to arise from the electronic structure near the fermi surface ( fs ) of the cuo@xmath24 planes .",
    "arpes studies in ndcecuo @xcite have revealed a small electron - like fs pocket in the underdoped region , and a simultaneous presence of both electron- and hole - like pockets near optimal doping .",
    "the conclusions of the arpes measurements and first - principle calculations of the electronic structure on the electron - doped high - t@xmath11 superconductors ln@xmath25ce@xmath26cuo@xmath27 ( ln = nd , sm and eu ) , performed by ikeda et al .",
    "@xcite are in accordance with the results of papers @xcite .    a spin density wave ( sdw ) model@xcite was proposed which gives qualitative explanation to arpes observations . in this model , sdw ordering would induce fs reconstruction that results in an evolution from an electron pocket to the coexistence of electron - like and hole - like pockets and then into a single hole - like fs with increasing of doping . at present the development of this theoretical model",
    "is continued @xcite .",
    "a model of fs reconstruction , induced by sdw , was equally well used for interpretation both of high - field hall effect and magnetoresistance in electron - doped pr@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath28 films @xcite and of doping dependence of shubnikov - de - haas ( sdh ) oscillations in nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath28 single crystals @xcite .",
    "a two - carrier model with coexisting of electrons and holes turns out to be suitable also for describing of temperature and doping dependencies of normal state hall effect and thermopower in nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath28 @xcite ,",
    "pr@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath28 @xcite and la@xmath25ce@xmath26cuo@xmath27 thin films @xcite .    thus , it seems to us that it is just the time to make a new attempt of describing the behavior of the mixed state hall effect in electron - doped superconductors on the ground of a two - carrier model . in this paper",
    "we study magnetic field dependencies of longitudinal and hall resistivities of electron - doped superconductor nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 with various ce content both in the normal and the mixed states .",

    "three types of samples with @xmath29=0.15 were obtained : as - grown samples , optimally reduced samples ( optimally annealed in a vacuum at t = 780@xmath30c for t = 60 min ; p = 10@xmath31mmhg ) and non optimally reduced samples ( annealed in a vacuum t = 780@xmath30c for t = 40 min ; p = 10@xmath31mmhg ) , five types of samples with @xmath29=0.14 : optimally annealed in a vacuum at t = 780@xmath30c for t = 25 min ; p = 10@xmath31mmhg and four non optimally reduced samples ( annealed in a vacuum t = 780@xmath30c for t = 5 , 20 , 30 , 64 min ; p = 10@xmath31mmhg ) , ten types of samples with @xmath29 = 0.17 : optimally annealed in a vacuum at t = 780@xmath30c for t = 50 min ; p = 10@xmath31mmhg ) and non optimally reduced samples ( annealed in a vacuum t = 780@xmath30c for different times ; p = 10@xmath31mmhg ) and five types of samples with @xmath29=0.18 : optimally annealed in a vacuum at t = 600@xmath30c for t = 35 min ; p = 10@xmath32mmhg and four non optimally reduced samples ( annealed in a vacuum t = 600@xmath30c for t = 10 , 15 , 25,60 min ; p = 10@xmath32mmhg ) the film thickness was 1200 - 3800  .    a part of experimental results on the galvanomagnetic properties of these films are presented earlier @xcite .",

    "magnetic field dependencies of resistivity @xmath35 and hall coefficient @xmath52 , usually observed in semiconductors with two ( or several ) types of carriers @xcite , are associated both with strong - field condition @xmath53 1 ( @xmath54 being a cyclotron frequency and @xmath55 being an momentum relaxation time ) at least for one of the types and with widely different carrier mobilities .",

    "thus , an anomalous sign reversal of hall effect in the mixed state of investigated systems may be described rather well by a flux - flow model for two types of carriers with opposite charges .",
    "we have analysed the ce doping dependence of the normal state hall coefficient in optimally reduced nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 single crystal films and , on the grounds of this analysis , have recruited a two - carrier model for describing of the mixed state hall coefficient .",
    "our scheme is based on a simple drude model for normal state and on a semiphenomenological bardeen - stephen model for the mixed one modified by coexistence of electrons and holes .",
    "this description may be considered as an illustration of a possibility for the natural explanation of hall effect sign reversal systematically observed in a mixed state of cuprate superconductors .",
    "such an approach may occur actual in the light of much recent efforts on experimental ( arpes ) and theoretical ( sdw - model ) investigations of the electronic structure near fermi surface in the cuo@xmath24 plane of high - t@xmath11 superconducting systems .",
