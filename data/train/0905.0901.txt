    "<S> we then adiabatically drag the system to a new hamiltonian whose ground state has a bell pair on the first and second qubit ( again @xmath1 . ) throughout the evolution the lowest energy level , which is two - fold degnerate , remains degenerate . </S>",
    "<S> if we encode a single qubit of information into this degeneracy , then after this adiabatic evolution the information in this first qubit will now reside in the third qubit .    </S>",

    "<S> thus we see that actually the information from the first qubit has been dragged to the information on the last qubit .    </S>",
    "<S> because the gap of the above adiabatic quantum evolution is constant , if we evolve the system sufficiently slowly and in a smooth enough manner , then the adiabatic theorem guarantees that we can achieve the above process with a high fidelity . </S>",
    "<S> there are numerous adiabatic theorems that can be proven  ( see for example @xcite ) which provide guarantees that by making @xmath20 sufficiently large we can increase the probability that the adiabatic evolution will act successfully ( meaning the probability that the system is excited out of the desired subspace is smaller than some constant ) . </S>",

    "<S> is it possible to achieve a similar result without the ancilla qubit ? if we wish to simply interpolate between two two - qubit hamiltonians , then no . </S>",
    "<S> this does not imply that it is impossible to adiabatically swap two qubits , only that a construction which behaves like the adiabatic quantum algorithm is not possible . </S>",

    "<S> first we will show how in the process of swapping we can also apply a single qubit gate by a simple modification of our initial hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we label this protocol adiabatic gate teleportation ( agt ) in analogy with how gates can be teleported in the quantum circuit model  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> suppose , in analogy with the teleportation of quantum gates , that we apply a unitary rotation on the third qubit on the initial hamiltonian @xmath10 : i.e. consider the initial hamiltonian @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> such an operation does not change the final hamiltonian , but does change the initial hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we can then carry the above analysis forward as before , but now in this changed basis . at the end of the evolution we end up with </S>",
    "<S> the logical qubit dragged to the third physical qubit in a rotated basis . </S>",
    "<S> the gap remains @xmath47 since the spectrum is unchanged by a unitary conjugation . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is possible , using this construction , to perform any single - qubit unitary during the adiabatic teleportation . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the rotated @xmath10 will still consist of two - qubit interactions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if we wish to perform a hadmard gate , we can use the same final hamiltonian , @xmath48 , but chang the initial hamiltonian to @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to make different assumptions about how the new , rotated @xmath50 hamiltonian arises physically . </S>",
    "<S> we can just assume , for example , that a set of @xmath10 are available in order to perform the desired quantum gates . </S>",
    "<S> a different assumption is that we start with only hamiltonians of the form @xmath51 between qubits @xmath52 and @xmath53 , but allows for one to adiabatically drag this hamiltonian to other `` gate teleporting '' hamiltonians . in this model </S>",
    "<S> we must ensure that the total system remains in the ground space for the entire evolution , so we must also adiabatically transition from our canonical initial hamiltonian @xmath54 to a new hamiltonian @xmath55 which leaves the @xmath52 qubit untouched but prepares @xmath56 on the @xmath53 qubit for agt . </S>",
    "<S> we call this adiabatic gate preparation ( agp ) . in general , </S>",
    "<S> such an evolution is nt directly possible for an arbitrary choice of @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for example , consider @xmath58 . ) </S>",
    "<S> we can circumvent this by using a universal gate set for a single qubit where every member of the gate set yields an @xmath59 with a gap . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , we can choose the unitaries @xmath60 which have the requisite properties . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath61 matrix is , up to a phase , a square root of the hadamard matrix , i.e. @xmath62 , while @xmath63 satisfies @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum agp gaps are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , at @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> together , @xmath61 and @xmath63 generate @xmath67 and hence are universal for single - qubit operations ( see pg . </S>",
    "<S> 196 of @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next consider how to achieve two - qubit gates during the swapping of two qubits . to do this </S>",
    "<S> we follow as above , but instead of applying a single - qubit gate , we apply a two - qubit gate on the final two output qubits . for example , suppose that we wish to apply a controlled - phase between two logical qubits </S>",
    "<S> . then we start with @xmath68 and end with the hamiltonian @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the controlled - phase between the the third and sixth physical qubit . </S>",
    "<S> notice that the gap in this system is again the same constant @xmath65 , but now we require three - qubit interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> we can bypass the inconvenient three - qubit interactions by using perturbation theory gadgets @xcite , i.e. two - body hamiltonians whose low energy dynamics mimic three - qubit interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the price is a reduction in the energy gap by a constant . in the appendix at the end of this paper we provide a detailed analysis of one such construction . </S>",
    "<S> the crux of this analysis shows that we can use two ancilla qubits and interactions of strength @xmath9 and @xmath71 to produce an adiabatic evolution with energy gap @xmath72 with a gate fidelity of @xmath73 .    , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 we can perform universal quantum computation . </S>",
    "<S> here we diagram how this works for a single - qubit computation ( circuit below , the hamiltonians at different times diagramed from top to bottom . ) </S>",
    "<S> each circle represents a qubit , and a bar represents a two - qubit hamiltonian in our scheme , rotated by a labeled unitary @xmath76 . notice how in each step to the next hamiltonian , the qubit is swapped over two qubits ( the arrows ) and a gate is applied to this qubit . </S>",
    "<S> thus the gates to be applied are encoded spatially across the the three hamiltonians . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath77th gate thus depends on the the hamiltonian @xmath78 with the gate being applied changing the interaction between qubits @xmath79 and @xmath80 in this hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> generalizing to more than one qubit this proves that universal holonomic quantum computation can be done by interpolation between only three hamiltonians . ]    </S>",
    "<S> putting this all together we have shown how to use agt to perform one- and two - qubit gates by teleporting quantum information adiabatically between qubits . </S>",
    "<S> given the ability to prepare fiducial initial single - qubit states and the ability to measure the qubits which contain the state of the final system , we then obtain a model equivalent in power to the standard circuit model of qc .    _ relationship to holonomic qc _  in holonomic quantum computing ( hqc ) one uses a cyclic adiabatic evolution of a hamiltonian around a loop in parameter space to produce a quantum gate . </S>",
    "<S> almost all hqc is cast within the context of cyclic evolutions , with the exception of kult _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite who pointed out that noncyclic geometric gates are also possible . </S>",
    "<S> agt is a example of a noncyclic geometric gate : so long as the evolution is adiabatic and we remain within the control manifold defined by the two interactions we are turning on and off , the desired gate is enacted independent of the actual time dependence of the path taken . </S>",
    "<S> our construction is distinguished in two ways . </S>",
    "<S> first , we achieve robustness by turning on and off interactions between two different subsystems ( as opposed to controlling interactions within the same system ) , and we expect that the separation of control needed to make geometric evolution robust will be much easier to achieve in this setting . </S>",
    "<S> second , our explicit connection to gate teleportation leads directly to universal qc and enables methods from fault - tolerance theory .    </S>",
    "<S> _ possible architectures _ </S>",
    "<S>  there are many different schemes for using the above agt primitives to build a universal quantum computer . using minimal resources , </S>",
    "<S> we can build a circuit on @xmath81 qubits using only @xmath82 qubits ( @xmath83 qubits for the two extra gates and @xmath84 for the ancillas in the perturbation gadgets ) assuming that we can move the qubits involved in the hamiltonians around at will . </S>",
    "<S> more realistic and interesting architectures disallow such movement , but allow the parallel circuit elements required for fault - tolerant qc .    </S>",
    "<S> one very compelling architecture builds a circuit on @xmath81 qubits using @xmath85 qubits ( plus @xmath81 ancilla gadget qubits ) in a quasi - one - dimensional architecture . </S>",
    "<S> the idea here is simply that one can perform alternating steps in a quantum circuit by gate teleportation from the first @xmath81 qubits to the third @xmath81 qubits and then back to the first @xmath81 qubits . </S>",
    "<S> another possible architecture builds a quantum circuit of length @xmath86 on @xmath81 qubits onto teleportation across @xmath87 qubits by simply imprinting the quantum circuit being implemented spatially ( in a manner similar to what occurs in one - way quantum computing  @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> thus we can perform universal qc by interpolating between just three different fixed hamiltonians ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig ] . )    _ fault tolerance _  a full analysis of fault - tolerance in the piecewise adiabatic scheme is beyond the scope of this letter , but here we argue that our system should show similar behavior to fault - tolerance in the standard quantum circuit model . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is simply that agt , while using adiabatic evolution , essentially has the behavior of producing a gate on some ( teleported ) quantum information . </S>",
    "<S> thus we could use the standard techniques for proving a threshold on this model . </S>",
    "<S> that said , however , in practice this model may perform significantly better than the standard circuit model . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the system is always performing adiabatic evolution with a constant energy gap ( unlike many other models which yield energy gaps which scale inversely as a polynomial in the number of qubits . ) </S>",
    "<S> thus we obtain two of the benefits of adibatic qc , ( 1 ) the system is separated by a constant energy barrier from , and thus at low temperature is robust to , excitation out of the ground state ( a form of leakage error ) and ( 2 ) considerable robustness exists with respect to varying the tunings which change the hamiltonian adiabatically .    </S>",
    "<S> _ comparison to other schemes _  using piecewise adiabatic quantum gate teleportations to build a quantum computer shares similarities with many other schemes , but differs in many respects as well . </S>",
    "<S> like universal adiabatic qc , the scheme uses a smooth one way interpolation between an initial and final hamiltonian , but we use multiple such interpolations . </S>",
    "<S> like holonomic qc , we rely on degenerate levels of a hamiltonian , but here our adiabatic evolution is not cyclic . along these lines , </S>",
    "<S> our scheme is related to a recent method to make holonomic qc fault - tolerant @xcite by using interpolations between encoded pauli operators . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to our proposal , these are done in a cyclic fashion and with three - qubit interactions . </S>",
    "<S> further we achieve a gate by controlling interactions between separate subsystems , thus insuring that the geometric robustness depends only on the degree to which these independent controls can be manipulated .    </S>",
    "<S> finally the scheme is similar in spirit to recent proposals to use spin chains with adiabatic time - dependent interactions to transmit quantum information  @xcite , where interpolation between two spin-@xmath88 hamiltonians was used to transmit quantum information down the chain with an energy gap that scaled ( at least numerically ) as @xmath89 where @xmath86 is the length of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , our scheme maintains a constant energy gap for the entire computation . </S>",
    "<S> while both schemes require similar transmission times , the former  @xcite has a small energy gap , which will be a problem when using this scheme at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by explicitly connecting our scheme to gate teleportation , we achieved a universal qc .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion _  we have shown how to build a universal quantum computer using a series of piecewise adiabatic quantum evolutions related to teleportation . </S>",
    "<S> this opens up a novel architecture for building a quantum computer based entirely on adiabatic quantum evolutions between two - qubit interactions and it considerably simplifies the control requirements for building a quantum computer .    after completing this paper </S>",
    "<S> we became aware of concurrent work done independently by oreshkov  @xcite showing a similar result using cyclic two - qubit interpolations .    </S>",
    "<S> we thank d.  gottesman for discussions . </S>",
