    "in fact , ir measurements displayed an splitting of the vibron mode in the interval @xmath54  k  [ ] . this sppliting can be induced by the degenerancy removal of the infrarred @xmath55 mode due to the decrease of the crystal quality caused by precursor effects of the mgzn@xmath0  @xmath1  mgcu@xmath0 transition .    )",

    "in fact , accurate electronic density of states ( dos ) analysis performed on the perfect mgzn@xmath0 , mgcu@xmath0 and alb@xmath0 crystal structures show no closure of the electronic band gap up to compressions of at least @xmath57  gpa .",

    "an intriguing physical phenomenon has been recently predicted and subsequently observed in h@xmath0 under pressure .",
    "it consists in the appearance of a maximum peak on its melting line followed by a negative @xmath16 slope  [ ] .",
    "this phenomenon have been explained in terms of subtle changes on the intermolecular forces due to compression instead of more familiar arguments like promotion of valence electrons to higher energy orbitals or occurrence of molecular dissociation processes .",
    "motivated by these interesting findings on hydrogen , we investigated the dynamical properties of ar(h@xmath0)@xmath0 at high-@xmath12 and high-@xmath35 in the search of similar physical manifestations and to provide further understanding of vdw compounds in general . there",
    "exist several well - established techniques by which one can determine the melting line of a material ; these essentially base on solid - liquid phase coexistence simulations and/or gibbs free - energy calculations  [ ] .",
    "application of these methods at quantum first - principles level of description , however , turns out to be computationally very intensive and laborious .",

    "results  ( i ) and  ( ii ) can be interpreted in terms of similar arguments than recently disclosed in solid mixtures of ne - he and ar - he , namely : lattices composed of same - species particles effectively behave like not interacting one with another but following alike physical trends ( bond distance , compressibility , etc . ) than found in their respective pure system  [ ] . in fact , we recently conjectured the superior energy stability of the mgcu@xmath0 structure over mgzn@xmath0 in ar(h@xmath0)@xmath0 , as rigorously demonstrated here , using this type of reasoning and crystal symmetry arguments  [ ] .",
    "regarding result  ( iii ) , this is in itself a manifestation of a very peculiar and intriguing physical phenomenon . in general , systems presenting negative melting slope are characterized by open crystalline structure ( water and graphite ) , surpassing promotion of valence electrons in the fluid phase ( alkali metals ) or continuous changing interparticle interactions ( molecular hydrogen ) . in the present case either open crystalline structure or electronic band promotion effects ( energetically prohibitive ) can be ruled out , so changes in the interparticle interactions holds as the likely cause .",
    "the question to be answered next then is : what is the exact nature of these changing interactions ? , or more precisely , do they relate to dramatic changes in electronic structure ?",
    "are the ionic degrees of freedom and effective decoupling of the ar and h@xmath0 lattices crucial to them ? in order to detect possible electronic phase transitions and/or molecular dissociation processes , we performed meticulous averaged dos and h - h radial correlation function ( @xmath63 ) analysis over the atomic configurations generated in the aimd runs . within the thermodynamic range @xmath2  gpa and @xmath64  k ( where @xmath65 ) , we found that ar(h@xmath0)@xmath0 is always an insulator material , either solid or liquid , where h@xmath0 molecules remain stable",
    "therefore , dramatic changes in electronic structure can be discarded as the originating mechanism behind the alternating sign of @xmath16 . actually , on the contrary case , one would have expected the value of @xmath16 to be negative also beyond @xmath66  gpa since in principle there is not reason to think that the originating electronic effects go missing at higher-@xmath12 .",
    "interestingly , at compressions above @xmath67  gpa and temperatures high enough for the system to melt we did observe closure of the electronic energy band gap ; according to @xmath63 analysis and visual recreation of the aimd configurations , this electronic phase transition is a consequence of emergent h@xmath0 dissociation processes . in figure",
    "[ fig : dos - hh ] , we enclose dos and @xmath63 results that illustrate this insulator - to - metal phase transition .",
    "it is worth noticing that this result is consistent with shock - wave compression experiments  [ ] and _ ab initio",
    "_ investigations  [ ] performed on pure hydrogen . with regard to the predicted negative melting slope ,",
    "ionic effects are the likely subjacent cause .",
    "considering results  ( i ) and  ( ii ) above , one can envisage a plausible explanation of this phenomenon : since the lattice of h@xmath0 molecules melts at temperatures much lower than the lattice of ar atoms does , collisions between diffusive h@xmath0 molecules and localized ar atoms act like effective thermal - like excitations on the last that ultimately provoke the global melting of the system at temperatures below those of pure ar .",
    "h@xmath0 itself presents negative melting slope beyond @xmath62  gpa so this effect is echoed , and enhanced significantly , in the melting line of ar(h@xmath0)@xmath0 ( see figure  [ fig : ub - melting ] ) . beyond @xmath66  gpa ,",
    "the stability of the ar lattice becomes further reinforced so the effect of h@xmath0 collisions there is just to deplete the slope of the global melting curve in comparison to that of pure ar . in order to test the validity of such hypothesis , we performed a series of aimd simulations at @xmath68  gpa ( @xmath69  @xmath34/particle ) in which we kept the lattice of h@xmath0 molecules _",
    "frozen _ and left the lattice of ar atoms to evolve . under these conditions we found that fusion of the ar structure occurs at temperatures @xmath70  k above that of pure ar , hence the original melting mechanism proposed seems to be corroborated .",
    "analogous melting behavior than described here can be expected in other rare gas - h@xmath0 compounds , like xe(h@xmath0)@xmath71 , and maybe also in sih@xmath72(h@xmath0)@xmath0 and ch@xmath72(h@xmath0 ) .",
    "to summarize , we have studied the behavior of ar(h@xmath0)@xmath0 under pressure at low and high temperatures using computational first - principles techniques . as results ,",
    "we have unravelled ( i )  temperature(pressure)-induced solid - solid phase transitions that may resolve the existing discrepancies between the sets of r and ir experimental data , and ( ii )  an anomalous melting phenomenon consisting of negative melting slope .",
    "the atypical melting line of ar(h@xmath0)@xmath0 can be understood in terms of the decoupling of h@xmath0 and ar ionic degrees of freedom and of coexistence of same - species liquid and solid phases .",
