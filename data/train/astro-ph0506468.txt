    "a wonderful surprise of the last decade was the discovery of `` hot jupiters '' : giant planets that orbit their parent stars at a distance smaller than 10 stellar radii ( mayor & queloz 1995 , butler et al.1997 ) .",
    "the proximity of the star and planet raises the possibility of tidal interactions between them . of these interactions ,",
    "the most frequently discussed are the synchronization of the planetary rotation period and orbital period , which happens over @xmath0@xmath1  yr , and orbital circularization , over @xmath2  yr ( see , e.g. , rasio et al.1996 , lin & gu 2004 ) . less frequently discussed , but often implicit , is tidal evolution of the obliquity ( the angle between the planetary spin axis and the orbit normal ) , which occurs on the same time scale as synchronization ( peale 1999 ) .",
    "we wish to point out that in some circumstances a close - in planet can maintain a nonzero obliquity , and that the consequent heat from obliquity tides can be large enough to affect the internal structure of the planet .",
    "we present the heating calculation first , in   1 , since it does not depend upon our particular scheme for maintaining the obliquity .",
    "our proposal , given in   2 , is that hot jupiters occupy cassini states , in which spin precession resonates with orbital precession . in ",
    "3 we ask whether obliquity tides can explain the famously small density of the extrasolar planet hd  209458b . in   4 , we discuss the implications , strengths , weaknesses , and possible tests of this theory .",
    "tidal torques synchronize the planetary spin frequency ( @xmath3 ) and orbital mean motion ( @xmath4 ) , and often reduce the obliquity ( @xmath5 ) to zero ( goldreich & peale 1970 ) . henceforth , if the orbit is circular , the tidal bulge is motionless in the reference frame of the planet and energy dissipation ceases",
    ". however , dissipation continues if the planet somehow maintains a nonzero eccentricity or obliquity . for a star of mass @xmath6 and a planet of mass  and radius  in an orbit with semimajor axis @xmath7 ,",
    "the rate of energy loss through tidal friction is @xmath8   \\left ( 7 e^2 + \\sin^2 \\theta \\right ) .",
    "\\label{eq : heat}\\ ] ] this formula , derived in a different context by wisdom ( 2004 ) , employs the customary model of friction within astronomical bodies : @xmath9 is the `` quality factor '' of tidal oscillations ( the inverse of the fractional energy dissipated per cycle ) .",
    "the factor @xmath10 is the displacement love number , parameterizing our ignorance of the planet s deformability .",
    "the factor in square brackets may be written @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the orbital period .    for this heat source to play a significant role in determining the structure of the planet",
    ", it must be comparable to the intrinsic luminosity @xmath13 of other processes ( e.g.  gravitational contraction , stellar irradiation , radioactivity , and nuclear reactions ) .",
    "for jupiter , @xmath14  erg  s@xmath15 .",
    "for hot jupiters , theoretical estimates of @xmath13 are difficult to summarize ( depending as they do upon the planet s age , temperature , composition , atmosphere , and interior structure ) but for billion - year - old planets of jupiter s radius and mass , one expects @xmath16  erg  s@xmath15 ( see , e.g. , guillot & showman 2002 , baraffe et al .  2003 ) .",
    "tidal heating is dominant when @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "the importance of eccentricity tides is well known ( bodenheimer , lin , & mardling 2001 ) , but the equivalent importance of obliquity tides does not seem to have been appreciated .",
    "the reason is probably a mistaken intuition that @xmath19 is the only possible endpoint of tidal evolution . in general , the planet s spin axis and its orbit both precess , in response to additional planets , satellites , the stellar quadrupole , or other torquing agents . with spin and orbital precession ,",
    "the outcomes of tidal evolution are cassini states ( colombo 1966 , peale 1969 , ward 1975 ) , in which the orbit normal  and spin axis  precess at the same rate about the same axis  ( see fig .  1 ) . for a given body , there are at most two stable cassini states , differing in whether  and  are on the same side of  ( state 1 ) or opposite sides ( state 2 ) .",
    "the obliquity @xmath20 of a cassini state is not generally zero , nor is it necessarily close to zero .",
    "although many satellites in the solar system are in state 1 with vanishingly small obliquity , the moon is in state 2 with @xmath21 .",
    "idealizing the planet as an oblate rigid body on a circular and uniformly precessing orbit of inclination @xmath22 , the cassini obliquities @xmath23 obey @xmath24 here we have defined @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the nodal precession frequency and @xmath27 is the spin precessional constant for a fixed orbit .",
    "the latter can be written @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the planet s principal moments of inertia , and @xmath3 is its spin frequency . during synchronization , @xmath30 . when @xmath31 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : cassini - obliquity ] ) has 4 roots , corresponding to the two stable states , 1 and 2 , and two unstable states , 3 and 4 .",
    "for @xmath32 , there are only 2 roots , corresponding to states 2 and  3 .",
    "( [ eq : cassini - obliquity ] ) can be derived from the governing hamiltonian under the assumption of principal - axis rotation ( see , e.g. , ward 1975 ) , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the -independent portion .",
    "2 shows contours of @xmath35 ( ) for an illustrative case .    a hot jupiter settles into a cassini state on the same @xmath0@xmath1  yr time scale as spin - orbit synchronization . whether it ends up in state 1 or 2 depends upon its initial obliquity and orbital inclination , and upon @xmath36 , which may be a function of time .",
    "reasons for variations in @xmath36 include the disappearance of the protoplanetary disk , migration of the planet or its fellow planets or satellites , contraction of the planet , and spin alteration of the planet or star .",
    "if @xmath36 varies slowly compared to @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( `` adiabatically '' ) , and slowly compared to the cassini state settling time , then the obliquity tracks the evolving cassini obliquity .",
    "abrupt changes in @xmath36 or @xmath5 may cause the planet to leave a cassini state , and ultimately to switch states if it lands in the basin of attraction of the other stable state .",
    "2 suggests three ways in which a hot jupiter can maintain a significant obliquity .",
    "first , if @xmath32 , the only stable state is 2 , for which the obliquity is nonzero ( @xmath39 as @xmath40 ) .",
    "this is the case for the moon .",
    "second , it could be in state 1 or 2 with @xmath41 , but this requires a special coincidence , since @xmath36 involves both planet - specific properties ( namely , its moments of inertia ) and seemingly unrelated quantities specific to other bodies ( which determine the precessional torques ) .",
    "third , the planet could be in state 2 with @xmath42 . when @xmath36 is small , the basin of attraction of state 2 is also small , but it is possible to be captured into state 2 when @xmath36 is large and then tipped over to large obliquity as @xmath36 is gradually reduced .",
    "ward & hamilton ( 2004 ) proposed this scenario to explain why saturn has a much larger obliquity than jupiter . in the next section ,",
    "we propose a similar scenario for a particular extrasolar planet .",
    "the planet hd  209458b transits its parent star ( charbonneau et al.2000 , henry et al .",
    "2000 ) , a fortuitous circumstance that enables many interesting measurements , including that of the planet s mean density , which is 0.33  g  @xmath43 .",
    "this is 27% of the jovian value and is the smallest mean density of all 7 known transiting extrasolar planets ( see , e.g. , alonso et al .",
    "2004 , konacki et al .",
    "2005 , pont et al.2005 ) .",
    "theorists have struggled to explain this anomaly , usually by attempting to identify an overlooked internal heat source , although burrows , sudarsky , & hubbard ( 2003 ) argued that the density is not so terribly anomalous .",
    "we present a new hypothesis : hd  209458b resides in cassini state 2 with a large obliquity , whereas most hot jupiters reside in state 1 with small obliquities .",
    "we are led to imagine the following sequence of events : ( 1 ) the planet forms at a large orbital distance , with a nonzero ( but not necessarily large ) obliquity .",
    "( 2 ) the planet migrates inward to its current position .",
    "( 3 ) as the spin and orbit are synchronized over @xmath0@xmath1  yr , the planet falls into cassini state 2 , whether by chance or because state 2 is the only possibility .",
    "( 4 ) as the disk disappears over @xmath0@xmath44  yr , the orbital precession rate ( and @xmath36 ) decreases , forcing the obliquity to grow .",
    "( 5 ) the planet remains in state 2 for billions of years .",
    "is this scenario compatible with order - of - magnitude estimates of the relevant quantities ?",
    "we assume @xmath45 , because winn et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found an angle of @xmath464  between the sky projections of the stellar spin axis and orbit normal , and it seems reasonable that @xmath47 is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we estimate @xmath48 by scaling jupiter s observed value ( de pater & lissauer 2001 ) by @xmath49 .",
    "application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpha ] ) gives @xmath50 after synchronization .",
    "we assume that @xmath26 was initially determined by the torque of the protoplanetary disk , which we idealize as a minimum - mass solar nebula .",
    "the precession rate is sensitive to the ( unknown ) inner radius of the disk : for @xmath51 , @xmath52 , rising to @xmath53 for @xmath54 .",
    "these estimates ignore resonance effects , which we find through trial numerical integrations to be capable of enhancing @xmath26 by an order of magnitude . as the disk disappears",
    ", @xmath26 falls until other torques dominate , such as those from the stellar quadrupole or additional orbiting bodies . in the former case , assuming @xmath55 , the precession slows to @xmath56 .",
    "there is no evidence for additional bodies in current radial velocity data ( laughlin et al .",
    "2005 ) , but even a body too small or too distant to have been detected could nevertheless cause faster precession than the stellar quadrupole alone .",
    "for example , a 1@xmath57 planet in a 1.2  day orbit would cause @xmath58 , while producing undetectable radial velocity variations of @xmath00.5  m  s@xmath15 .",
    "we note that @xmath26 is measurable , in principle , through time variations of the transit duration ( miralda - escud 2002 ) .    with these considerations",
    ", it seems plausible that @xmath36 had an initial value ranging from 0.02 to near unity , and a final value between @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the initial value of @xmath36 could have been large enough that capture into cassini state 2 occurred with reasonable probability , or even 100% probability if @xmath61 . the final value of @xmath36 is small enough to force @xmath62 .",
    "thus , the current obliquity must be quite large .",
    "the energy dissipated through obliquity tides comes at the expense of the orbital energy",
    ". we must examine whether it is possible for the dissipation rate to be large enough to inflate the planet , yet slow enough to allow the orbit to survive for @xmath63  yr , the approximate main - sequence age of the star ( cody & sasselov 2002 ) . to inflate the planet , bodenheimer , laughlin ,",
    "& lin ( 2003 ) found the required power to be @xmath64  erg  s@xmath15 if the planet has a dense core , and an order of magnitude smaller if the planet is coreless . with reference to eq .",
    "( [ eq : heat ] ) , this corresponds to an upper limit on @xmath65 of @xmath1 for a cored planet and @xmath44 for a coreless planet .",
    "the condition @xmath66 yields a lower limit on @xmath65 of @xmath67 . in reality , eq .",
    "( [ eq : timescale ] ) is probably too restrictive by a factor of a few ; the dissipation rate was smaller in the past , when the planet had a smaller radius , a larger orbital distance , and possibly a larger mass ( vidal - madjar et al .",
    "thus , @xmath65 should be @xmath010@xmath68 if the planet has a core and @xmath1@xmath44 if it does not . in comparison , for jupiter",
    "it is thought that @xmath9 is between @xmath69 and @xmath1 ( goldreich & soter 1966 ) and @xmath70 ( gavrilov & zharkov 1977 ) .",
    "the required @xmath65 for hd  209458b is comparable to , or somewhat larger than , the nominal jovian value .",
    "the last chapter of the story is that the planet remains in cassini state 2 for billions of years . here",
    "the difficulty is that as @xmath36 decreases , the width of the resonance also decreases , reducing the robustness of state 2 to perturbations . for @xmath71 , the angle between the separatrix angles ( see fig .",
    "2 ) is only @xmath72 . for @xmath73 ,",
    "it is increased to @xmath74 .",
    "the impact of a body of mass @xmath75 at escape velocity would produce a maximum obliquity shift of @xmath76 where the maximum is achieved for grazing incidence at the pole .",
    "hence we must also suppose hd  209458b suffered no major collisions after the disappearance of the protoplanetary disk .",
    "hot jupiters should be in cassini states . since the obliquity of a cassini state is not necessarily small",
    ", obliquity tides are a potentially important internal heat source . whether a given planet can maintain a significant obliquity depends upon its initial obliquity as well as its precessional and collisional histories .",
    "obliquity tides could be the `` missing '' heat source that bloats the transiting planet hd  209458b .",
    "the implications of this hypothesis are that the planet s obliquity is nearly 90 , its tidal dissipation factor @xmath9 and displacement love number @xmath10 obey @xmath77 , and it had a quiescent history of no major collisions after its orbital precession rate declined from an initially large value .",
    "this hypothesis has certain strengths and weaknesses relative to the two leading prior hypotheses .",
    "guillot & showman ( 2002 ) proposed that atmospheric circulation patterns convert a small fraction of the stellar radiation into heat deep within the planet .",
    "an advantage of this hypothesis over ours is that no fine tuning of @xmath65 or the collision history is required .",
    "a disadvantage is that it is not obvious why the other hot jupiters should not experience the same phenomenon .",
    "in contrast , cassini state 2 is naturally a minority state for hot jupiters . after landing in state 2 ( possibly by chance )",
    ", a planet must avoid being jostled into state 1 by collisions or the synchronization process .    in the scenario of bodenheimer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , tidal heating from orbital circularization is extended indefinitely because of a periodic eccentricity exchange with another planet .",
    "the extra heat is the fault of a well - placed third body , which is naturally expected to be a rare occurrence .",
    "unfortunately , no such body has yet been detected , and the current eccentricity is small ( laughlin et al .",
    "2005 , winn et al.2005 ) .",
    "these problems have made the hypothesis less appealing than it once was , though they might be overcome through tuning of @xmath65 or other embellishments .",
    "a relative strength of our hypothesis that no third body is required , although a third body could increase the robustness of the high - obliquity state .",
    "further work is needed to improve upon our order - of - magnitude calculations .",
    "the synchronization process must be followed in detail because @xmath27 changes on the same time scale as obliquity evolution , and is therefore non - adiabatic ( peale 1974 ) .",
    "we treated the planet as an oblate spheroid , but in reality it is triaxial due to tidal distortion , a complexity that alters the cassini obliquities and dynamics ( peale 1969 ) .",
    "we ignored any evolution of @xmath78 or @xmath47 , and any non - uniform precession .",
    "finally , a realistic description of perturbations is needed to estimate the capture probability and lifetime of cassini state 2 .",
    "we can think of two possible tests of the theory that hd  209458b has a large obliquity , neither of which is easy .",
    "first , the obliquity can be measured or bounded through high - precision photometry of the transit ( seager & hui 2002 , barnes & fortney 2003 ) , but the expected signal is smaller than @xmath60 in relative flux .",
    "second , a hot jupiter with @xmath79 has no permanent dayside or nightside , and should have a smaller day  night temperature difference than a planet with @xmath80 . to quantify the expected temperature difference , atmospheric models of hot jupiters ( showman & guillot 2002 , cho et al .",
    "2003 , menou et al .  2003 , burkert et al .  2005 ) should be generalized to cases of large obliquity .",
    "we are indebted to j.  wisdom for his suggestion to investigate cassini states .",
    "we thank r.  crocker , s.  gaudi , g.laughlin , d.  lin , s.  peale , k.  penev , d.  sasselov , k.  stanek , and w.  ward for helpful discussions .",
