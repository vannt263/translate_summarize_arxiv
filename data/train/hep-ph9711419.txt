    "at future hadron colliders such as the upgraded fermilab tevatron with @xmath2 tev and the cern lhc ( 14 tev ) annual top yields of roughly @xmath3 ( with @xmath4 ) and @xmath5 top quark pairs , respectively , are expected @xcite .",
    "this translates into a measurement of the top quark mass and of the total @xmath1 production rate with a precision of at least @xmath6 gev and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "this envisaged high precision opens a new rich field of top quark related phenomenology .",
    "it suggests to explore the potential of performing electroweak precision studies with top quark observables even in an hadronic environment in the spirit of the successful lepi precision physics program .",
    "complementary to direct searches for signals of physics beyond the minimal standard model ( msm ) , observables being sensitive to the virtual presence of non - standard particles in strong top pair production processes might reveal information on the parameter space of the model under consideration .",
    "especially the strong top - yukawa coupling can serve as a probe of the msm higgs - sector .",
    "since the latter is the least experimentally explored sector of the msm , possible extensions are of particular interest .",
    "the consideration of a second higgs - doublet plays a special role since it is the minimally required scenario for mass generation in a supersymmetric extension of the msm .",
    "supersymmetry represents an additional symmetry between fermions and bosons which implemented in the msm solves such msm deficiencies like the necessity of fine tuning and the non - occurrence of gauge coupling unification at high energies .    in this contribution",
    "we study electroweak - like quantum effects of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in the main top quark production mechanisms at the upgraded tevatron and at the lhc , @xmath8 annihilation and gluon fusion , respectively .",
    "we give numerical results for the impact of the @xmath0 contribution on the total cross section @xmath9 and on the invariant mass distribution @xmath10 .",
    "we also present first results for a parity violating asymmetry @xmath11 observed in the strong production of left and right handed top(antitop ) quarks .",
    "for a more detailed discussion we refer to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "at @xmath0 within the mssm the @xmath12-vertex is modified through the virtual presence of a heavy and a light neutral scalar , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , a pseudo scalar @xmath15 and a charged higgs boson @xmath16 as well as charginos @xmath17 and sbottoms @xmath18 and neutralinos @xmath19 and stops @xmath20 . for the sake of completeness we also take into account the contributions of the electroweak gauge bosons ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 bosons ) .",
    "the @xmath0 contribution can be parametrized in terms of form factors revealing the lorentz - structure of the matrix elements to top pair production processes as follows :    @xmath23   v_{\\bar t}^l(p_1,s_1 )   \\ , \\bar{v}_{\\bar q}^k(p_3,s_3)\\gamma^{\\mu } \\ , u_{q}^i(p_4,s_4)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + the @xmath0 contribution to the gluon fusion subprocess comprises the vertex corrections in the @xmath24-and @xmath25-production channel @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , the off - shell top self energy insertion @xmath28 , the box diagrams @xmath29 and the @xmath24-channel higgs - exchange diagrams @xmath30 @xmath31 \\right .",

    "the observable hadronic cross section is obtained by convoluting the partonic cross sections with parton distribution functions ( after performing the @xmath41 integration ) @xmath42 with @xmath43 and the parton luminosities denoted by @xmath44 . in the numerical evaluation we use the mrsa set of parton distribution functions @xcite with the factorization ( @xmath45 ) and renormalization scale ( @xmath46 ) chosen to be @xmath47 with @xmath48 gev .",

    "can be observed originating from a resonance in the gluon fusion subprocess .",
    "first results for a differential left - right asymmetry loop - induced by parity violating electroweak - like interactions within the mssm are promising enough to motivate a more detailed study of the potential to use the top spin information for the detection / exclusion of specific non - standard physics scenarios .",
