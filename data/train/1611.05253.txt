    "in the design of engineering structures , the finite element method ( fem ) has been widely used to make critical decisions . in order to control the quality of numerical simulation and to develop confidence in decisions , a research topic , referred to as _ model verification _ , has been intensively studied for more than three decades . among different sources of computational errors , the discretization error is predominant and controllable . for the purpose of evaluating discretization error in finite element analysis ( fea ) ,",
    "several families of _ a posteriori _ error estimators @xcite have been presented , such as explicit error estimators @xcite , implicit error estimators @xcite , recovery - based error estimators @xcite , hierarchical estimators @xcite , _ constitutive relation error _ ( cre ) estimators @xcite , etc .",
    "the goal of many finite element computations is the determination of some specific quantities of interest in structural response , such as local stress values , displacements etc .",
    ", which is necessary for a particular design decision .",
    "thus , it is frequently the case that _ a posteriori _ finite element error analysis is focused on goal - oriented error estimation . towards this end , adjoint /",
    "dual - based techniques are used to estimate the errors in solution outputs , which have been systematically reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the research of goal - oriented error estimation was initiated in the mid-1990s @xcite . since then , several methods have been developed and applied in solutions of various problems , such as poisson s equation , linear and non - linear static problems in solid mechanics , eigenvalue problems , time - dependent problems , non - trivial problems of cfd , etc ( see @xcite for example ) . a variety of specific error estimation techniques have been proposed to evaluate the discretization error in quantities of interest , for instance , the adjoint - weighted residual method @xcite , the energy norm based estimates @xcite , the green s function decomposition method @xcite , the strict - bounding approach based on lagrangian formulation @xcite , the cre - based error estimation @xcite . among the available techniques ,",
    "the cre - based error estimation provides guaranteed strict bounds of quantities .",
    "the strict bounding property , together with its advantage of wide applicability @xcite , makes the cre stand out for goal - oriented error estimation .",
    "sensitivity analysis plays an important role in uncertain analysis , structural optimization and many other areas of structural analysis . when the fem is used in the first - order perturbed formulation to compute the static response sensitivity of a structural system , discretization error exists in the analysis .",
    "thus , _ a posteriori _ error estimator is required to evaluate the discretization error in the solution for sensitivity derivatives of the structural response , especially in computed values of some specific quantities about the response sensitivity . as far as the authors know ,",
    "the relevant error estimation techniques have not been adequately studied , and only limited information has been available . for example , the explicit ( residual - based ) error estimator has been used in _ a posteriori _",
    "error estimation in sensitivity analysis @xcite , and a neumann - subproblem _ a posteriori _ finite element procedure has been proposed to provide upper and lower bounds for functionals of the response sensitivity derivative fields @xcite .    on the basis of complementary energy principle",
    ", the cre - based goal - oriented error estimation will be extended to the cases of non - symmetrical bilinear forms , especially to the static response sensitivity analysis of linear structural systems in this paper .",
    "consequently , strict upper and lower bounds can be obtained for quantities of interest , which are linear functionals associated with the sensitivity derivative fields of displacements , including the sensitivity derivatives of some scalar - values static response quantities .    following the introduction ,",
    "the basics of the cre estimation and the cre - based goal - oriented error estimation are reviewed in section 2 . in section 3 , the cre - based error estimator is extended to the cases with non - symmetrical bilinear forms , and in section 4 , the estimator is used for goal - oriented error estimation of static response sensitivity .",
    "numerical results for a beam model problem are presented to validate bounding property of the proposed estimation technique in section 5 . in section 6 ,",
    "conclusions are drawn .",
    "at the beginning , a typical problem in structural analysis is introduced @xcite . a banach space @xmath0 , referred to as the configuration space , consists of all the possible displacements that satisfy the dirichlet boundary conditions . as its dual space , the loading space @xmath1 is given with the duality pair @xmath2 .",
    "usually , a load @xmath3 includes a body force in the domain that the structure occupies and a traction on its neumamm boundary .",
    "a banach space of strains , @xmath4 , and its dual space    the space of stresses , @xmath5 , are introduced , and their duality pair is written as @xmath6 .    the relation between a displacement element @xmath7 and its corresponding strain @xmath8 is represented by a linear differential operator @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 . the adjoint of operator @xmath11 , denoted by @xmath12 , is then defined as @xmath13 in structural analysis , the operator @xmath11 is usually gradient - like and @xmath14 is divergence - like , which is a natural derivation from green s formula . besides",
    ", the relation between stresses and strains , or termed the constitutive relation , is represented by a material operator @xmath15 .",
    "then the governing equations for the primal structural problem are given as follows : @xmath16 or written with a single unknown @xmath17 as @xmath18 with the aid of eq .",
    ", the weak form of eq .   is obtained as : find @xmath19 such that @xmath20 which is also referred to as the virtual work principle .",
    "the relations among the spaces and operators are outlined in figure [ spaces ] .        in this paper ,",
    "linear elastic problems are taken into consideration .",
    "then @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath21 are ascribed to hilbert spaces , @xmath22 is symmetrical and positive definite , and the operator @xmath23 is linear , reversible , symmetrical and positive definite . in this case ,",
    "@xmath24 , the differential operator in eq .   is of elliptic type .",
    "for example , @xmath25 and @xmath26 for a beam problem , where @xmath27 is the flexible stiffness ; @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath23 is the hooke s stiffness tensor for a membrane problem .    for notation , a symmetrical semi - positive definite bilinear form @xmath30 and the corresponding semi - norm , a symmetrical positive definite bilinear form @xmath31 and the corresponding norm",
    "are introduced as @xmath32 the duality pair @xmath2 is then written as @xmath33 for simplification .",
    "it can be proven that @xmath34 is a continuous and coercive bilinear form for linear elastic problems .",
    "this ensures the existence and uniqueness of the solution to eq .  , which is restated as : find @xmath35 such that @xmath36    the primal problem can be formulated as follows : find a displacement field @xmath17 and a stress field @xmath37 satisfying    * the compatibility condition : @xmath38 * the equilibrium condition : @xmath39 * the constitutive relation : ( hooke s law ) @xmath40    when eqs . , and hold true , the pair @xmath41 is the exact solution to the primal problem .",
    "to seek numerical solutions , the problem can be discretized using the displacement - based galerkin finite element method , i.e. find @xmath42 such that @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 denotes the finite element space under the mesh characterized by size @xmath46 . together with the solution of stress field @xmath47 the pair @xmath48 forms the finite element solution of the primal problem , resulting in a discretization error .",
    "the concept of constitutive relation error ( cre ) relies on the partitioning of the equations for the linear static structure , and into two groups :    * the compatibility condition and equilibrium condition , which are the admissibility conditions ; * the constitutive relation .",
    "it is natural to consider the admissible solution pair @xmath49 , i.e. the combination of    * the kinematically admissible field @xmath50 verifying and * the statically admissible field @xmath51 verifying .    the solution quality is quantified by the error of constitutive relations .    hence an error measured in terms of the constitutive relation",
    "is defined as @xmath52 which is the _ constitutive relation error _ ( cre )",
    ".    some important properties of the constitutive relation error are listed as follows : @xmath53 and @xmath54      the finite element solution for displacements satisfies @xmath55 , meaning that @xmath56 can be taken as the kinematically admissible field , i.e. @xmath57 .",
    "however , the finite element solution for stresses @xmath58 does not satisfy the equilibrium equations , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "one can construct @xmath60 additionally from the finite element stress solution @xmath61 by an energy relation called _ prolongation condition _ @xcite .",
    "the global energy norm error of the finite element solution , denoted by @xmath62 , is defined as @xmath63 according to eq .",
    ", the constitutive relation error @xmath64 , which can be considered as a global discretization error estimator , provides an upper bound of the global energy norm error , i.e. @xmath65      as a matter of fact , this bounding property is guaranteed by the well - known complementary energy principle . noticing that @xmath66 is the solution of such a problem :",
    "find @xmath67 such that @xmath68 where @xmath69 is defined as @xmath70 , @xmath71 .",
    "if the set of statically admissible fields of the original problem is represented as @xmath72 , the corresponding statically admissible set of residual problem is @xmath73 .",
    "then the complementary energy principle for residual problem gives @xmath74 considering @xmath75 and @xmath76 , one gets the bounding property immediately from eq . .",
    "assume that the quantity of interest , @xmath77 , is a linear bounded functional with respect to the displacement field @xmath78 defined in the following global form : @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",
    "then , an adjoint problem associated with the output @xmath77 can be defined as : find @xmath81 such that @xmath82 or formulated as : find a displacement field @xmath83 and a stress field @xmath84 that satisfy    * the compatibility condition : @xmath85 * the equilibrium condition : @xmath86 * the constitutive relation : @xmath87    similar to the primal problem , the displacement field for the adjoint problem can be approximately obtained using the galerkin finite element method : find @xmath88 such that @xmath89 and the stress field solution is given as @xmath90 accordingly .",
    "furthermore , an admissible pair @xmath91 for the adjoint problem can be derived using the same technique as that for the primal problem .    in a similar form to eq . , the computed value of the quantity of interest is denoted by @xmath92 from this expression together with the fact that @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the error of quantity @xmath77 is given as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is an arbitrary non - dimensional parameter .",
    "thus strict upper and lower bounds of @xmath97 can be represented in a computable form by introducing the admissible fields : @xmath98 taking @xmath99 , a pair of computable strict error bounds with the sharpest gap is given as follows : @xmath100 then the corresponding strict upper and lower bounds for quantity @xmath77 are @xmath101    * remark 1 : * as is well - known , @xmath102 is a bounded bilinear form on @xmath103 , i.e. there exists a constant @xmath104 such that @xmath105 , @xmath106 . in this remark ,",
    "a @xmath107-type problem is taken as example , and @xmath108 .",
    "when the interpolation functions are of order @xmath109 , the errors of @xmath56 and @xmath110 measured in the @xmath111-norm can be represented as : @xmath112 , @xmath113 , where @xmath114 and @xmath115 are positive constants , see @xcite .",
    "therefore , one has @xmath116 which acts as _ a priori _ error estimation for quantity @xmath77 .",
    "the variational problem is usually stated as : find @xmath117 such that @xmath118 where @xmath119 is a hilbert space , @xmath34 is continuous and coercive ( not necessarily symmetrical ) bilinear form defined on @xmath120 , and @xmath121 a linear bounded functional on @xmath119 i.e. @xmath122 . in a finite element space @xmath123 , an approximate solution @xmath124 can be found as @xmath125    for a quantity of interest @xmath126 with @xmath127 , the corresponding adjoint problem is defined as : find @xmath128 such that @xmath129 and the corresponding finite element solution is denoted as @xmath130 .",
    "let us denote the symmetrical part of @xmath131 as @xmath132 , i.e. @xmath133 , @xmath134 , define @xmath135 as @xmath136 and @xmath137 as @xmath138 , @xmath139 . since @xmath140 and @xmath141 , the error of quantity @xmath77 , i.e. @xmath142 can be represented as @xmath143 where @xmath96 , and the quadratic functional @xmath144 on @xmath119 is defined as @xmath145    consider the following minimizing problem : @xmath146 and it can be recognized that @xmath147 where @xmath148 are the solutions of the following residual problems : @xmath149 then it follows that @xmath150 which is in a similar form with the upper part of eq . .    if the equilibrium fields for the primal and adjoint residual problems in eq .",
    "are @xmath151 and @xmath152 that can be induced by a lower - order stress bilinear form @xmath153 , the bounding property of cre gives @xmath154 which is a natural result of the complementary energy principle ( or called dual variational principle ) .",
    "then similar bounds with those in eq . can be derived as @xmath155 with @xmath156 being taken as @xmath157{b_{\\sigma}^s(\\hat{\\sigma}^{res}_d,\\hat{\\sigma}^{res}_d)/b_{\\sigma}^s(\\hat{\\sigma}^{res}_p,\\hat{\\sigma}^{res}_p)}$ ] .",
    "note that in the symmetrical case in section 2 , one has @xmath158 in the discussion in subsection 2.4 , the bounding property of cre was also identified as a consequence of minimizing complementary energy for the residual problem .",
    "therefore , in the sense of complementary energy principle , the present bounding technique of goal - oriented error estimation for cases of non - symmetrical bilinear forms can be considered as an extension of the cre defined in symmetrical cases .",
    "for the static response sensitivity analysis of linear structural systems , the first - order perturbation method is usually used to evaluate variations of response variables around their central values resulting from the varying inputs . in the perturbed formulation of various variables , derivatives with respect to the input parameters",
    "are required , and those for the static responses are derived on the basis of the fe analysis at the central values through the perturbation method .",
    "thus , the finite element descritization error propagates through the numerical results of the sensitivity derivatives of response variables with respect to the inputs , which can be evaluated by the constitutive relation error in this section .",
    "suppose the description of the structural system is governed by several basic input parameters , one of which is denoted by @xmath159 with central value @xmath160 .",
    "in this paper , only the input parameters describing the material properties and load variables are under consideration , i.e. @xmath161 and the corresponding sensitivity to these input parameters are analyzed .",
    "the cases with basic geometrical parameters can be transformed into a similar form to those with material parameters , as stated in * remark 2*.    throughout this paper , the following symbols are employed to represent the quantities for the first - order perturbation : @xmath162|_{\\beta=\\bar{\\beta}}.\\ ] ] moreover , the bilinear forms @xmath163 , @xmath164 , the ( semi- ) norms @xmath165 , @xmath166 and the expression of @xmath167 represent the corresponding functionals when @xmath168 .",
    "besides , a bilinear form @xmath169 associated with the derivatives respect to the basic parameter @xmath159 is defined by @xmath170    for notation , more spaces @xmath171 are introduced",
    ". then , two bilinear forms @xmath172 and @xmath173 are given as @xmath174 where @xmath175 is a parameter to ensure that @xmath176 is coercive and the quadratic functional @xmath177 is positive definite ( see * remark 3 * ) .",

    "it can be seen that the geometrical parameters for the structural system are all included in the equivalent stiffness tensor @xmath207 , so the cases with geometrical parameters can be treated as ones with material parameters .",
