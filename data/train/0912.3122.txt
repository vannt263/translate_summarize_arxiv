    "the realistic electronic model for 2d ips includes several ( e.g. , five ) bands , emerging from @xmath30 orbitals of fe .",

    "the effective interaction , eq.([int ] ) , could be rewritten as the coupling to a fluctuating sdw field @xmath35 the sdw fluctuation @xmath36 should have in general , e.g. , for the relevant @xmath37 a finite projection on the usual spin operator @xmath38 ( emerging from local moments ) , but this remains to be shown by an explicit consideration within the full multi - orbital model for ips .",

    "the spin fluctuations @xmath46 in the normal phase are assumed to be centered at @xmath47 and broad enough in the @xmath48 space relative to h / e pockets .",
    "this is indeed well visible in recent ins results for the bafecoas system.@xcite hence we replace @xmath49 .",

    "@xcite we assume that the origin is in the non - fl character of @xmath64 and a strong coupling of carriers to the latter .",
    "indeed , recent ins results in electron - doped bafecoas indicate a behavior very close to the one for marginal fl.@xcite for generality we therefore assume further - on the form @xmath65 where @xmath66 is ( for @xmath67 ) the ( symmetrized ) dynamical spin correlation function . while @xmath67 yields the marginal fl ( ref .",

    "hence , we assume in the following calculations the simplified form for the unperturbed e / h bands , i.e. with 2d parabolic dispersions , @xmath94 with ( unrenormalized ) effective masses @xmath95 ( with lattice constant @xmath96 ) and the unperturbed dos @xmath97 .",

    "obviously , here the transport properties are dominated by the transport within the e - type band , although at high @xmath19 also hole pockets contribute partially . on the other hand",
    ", we realize that in such a case the treatment of minority ( h ) carriers is oversimplified , since even at modest @xmath115 the hole qps become heavily renormalized @xmath116 influencing also @xmath117 .",

    ", we introduce for the latter a simplification @xmath118 .",
    "note that @xmath119 influences results only indirectly , i.e. entering the dominant e - band damping @xmath21 via @xmath117 . at the same time ,",
    "the hole contribution to d.c .",
    "transport quantities remains subleading provided that @xmath120 , in particular at low @xmath19 .",

    "all varying between materials and different doping levels , we here mainly consider various possibilities and regimes which emerge from our analysis .    while displaying different regimes we fix some parameters .",

    "we assume as the parent system the semimetal with finite @xmath163 . the effect of doping leads then to an increase in @xmath135 where we take for simplicity @xmath164 and accordingly @xmath165 . since our treatment with a constant @xmath133 and without the possibility of an afm ordering",

    "4a is quite dramatic at @xmath167 .",

    "due to the phenomenological character of our theory as well as different ip material classes with quite different properties only a semi - quantitative comparison makes sense .",
    "our central goal is to reproduce quite systematic variation of transport properties with doping , from low electron doping over the intermediate regime ( optimal doping with highest @xmath3 ) to the overdoped one where sc disappears and ips become rather normal fl - type metals . in our approach",
    "the doping dependence enters primarily through the electron / hole concentration difference @xmath171 .",
    "but as well , it is plausible that also the spin - fluctuation spectra @xmath172 change , being strong and anomalous at low doping , and on the other hand at intermediate doping weaker and more fl - type in the low-@xmath50 regime . within our analysis",
    "we can partly simulate the latter development with increasing @xmath22 .    in the most challenging intermediate - doping regime",
    "our transport results match reasonably recent experiments on single - crystals of the co - doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 compound .",
    "note that bafecoas with @xmath173 at @xmath174  k typically reveal @xmath175  m@xmath147 cm with a rather @xmath19-linear variation and corresponding slope @xmath176",
    "@xmath177cm / k .",
    "@xcite as shown in fig .  2a the value ( note that @xmath178  m@xmath147 cm ) and the slope are reproduced within a factor of @xmath179 .",
    "while the magnitude of @xmath180 is mostly governed by the spin - fermion coupling @xmath128 and can be fitted to experiments accordingly , it is essential that our analysis also reproduces the anomalous variation of @xmath15 .",
    "recent data on bafecoas at @xmath181 reveal an abrupt increase in electron - like thermopower with a maximum value @xmath182 at @xmath183  k.@xcite for @xmath184 @xmath153 is decreasing in value .",
    "both these features as well as values are well reproduced in fig .",
    "2b .    with increasing co - doping in bafecoas , @xmath185 ,",
    "the resistivity behavior becomes closer to @xmath186 not so much reduced in value at @xmath187  k.@xcite in our analysis this corresponds to a change obtained by increasing the fl temperature @xmath68 with a simultaneous increase in @xmath171 as presented in figs .",
    "3a and 4a .",
    "even more pronounced change in character is in @xmath15 ( ref .",
    "18 ) since it reduces in value , loses the minimum and becomes fl - like , i.e. , @xmath188 .",

    "3c and 4c show that both @xmath68 as well as @xmath191 lead to a constant fl - like @xmath192 .",
    "the particular value at @xmath193 from our analysis is less reliable .",
    "while at weak coupling we recover the expected @xmath190 ( for @xmath194 ) the value can deviate for larger coupling since the approximations do not satisfy the luttinger - volume sum rule .",
    "note , however , that also the basic approximation eq.([sxy ] ) is not well understood yet .",
    "@xcite    qualitatively similar results for transport quantities have been previously obtained for polycrystalline samples of the electron - doped lfao family @xcite , discussed previously within the same phenomenological framework.@xcite while our present data with assumed parameters would quite well match the measured @xmath15,@xcite reported @xmath4 as well as the slope @xmath195 ( ref .",
    "12 ) are higher than in bafecoas by a factor @xmath196 .",
    "it seems indicative that also recent single - crystal data @xcite do not reduce these values . from our present analysis",
    "this would require larger @xmath132 which could open the question of entering the ( too ) strong coupling regime .",
    "in conclusion , let us first put the present theoretical approach and its possible extensions in the perspective of related theoretical approaches , in particular those treating the qp , magnetic , and transport quantities in ips .",
    "in contrast to many attempts to start with a more complete microscopic model,@xcite our approach is restricted to the simplest prototype two - band model coupled via spin fluctuations .",
    "these are taken as a phenomenological input of the marginal fl type whose deviation from the normal fl behavior is controlled by the crossover temperature @xmath22 .",
    "our analysis clearly indicates that the coupling appears not to be weak @xmath197at least as deduced from observed @xmath4@xmath198 $ ] and that spin fluctuations are quite strong in the low-@xmath50 regime as evidenced by ins experiments.@xcite it is therefore expected that our analysis can go beyond the weak - coupling approximation , being the basis , e.g. , for a random - phase - approximation - type treatment of many - orbital models .",
    "the latter has been tested so far mostly on reproducing the proper band structure and on a qualitative description of relevant normal - state instabilities , in particular the most challenging sc onset .",
    "evidently , our approach goes beyond the simple nesting scenario of the qp damping as well as of the sc pairing since in the latter wave vector ( @xmath199 ) dependences would play an essential role .    interpreting our results for anomalous transport properties of ips",
    ", we argue that they emerge as the interplay of several ingredients .",
    "first of all , observed @xmath4 requires large interband coupling since the transport becomes quite normal and modest when the electron doping depletes the hole band , i.e. on approaching @xmath168 .",
    "the magnetic origin of the coupling is quite natural since it is intimately connected to the afm ( sdw ) instability in the parent material and leads to an analogy with the physics of sc cuprates .",
    "highly nontrivial @xmath15 in our analysis can be mostly related to two effects : a ) asymmetric variation of the qp damping @xmath21 being the consequence of asymmetric dos @xmath117 due to the closeness of the top of the hole band , and b ) small @xmath200 which plays a role of the electron fermi energy entering directly the expected fl behavior @xmath201 .",
    "there are still several open questions even within the presented framework .",
    "generally , stronger interband coupling leads to strong damping of minority qp which requires the treatment beyond the weak coupling .",
    "the same obstacle arises in the treatment of the parent and a weakly doped semimetal , where also experiments indicate very incoherent transport above @xmath202 . also , a comparison with experimental results for particular compounds could lead to refined models to reach a closer quantitative agreement",
