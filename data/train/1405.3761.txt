    "quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite can provide unconditionally secure communication with ideal devices @xcite . in reality , due to the technical difficulty of building up ideal single photon sources , most of current qkd experiments use weak coherent - state pulses from attenuated lasers .",
    "such replacement opens up security loopholes that lead qkd systems to be vulnerable to quantum hacking , such as photon - number - splitting attacks @xcite .",
    "the decoy - state method @xcite has been proposed to close these photon source loopholes .",
    "it has been implemented in both optical fiber @xcite and free space channels @xcite .",
    "the security of decoy - state qkd relies on the assumption of the photon - number channel model @xcite , where the photon source can be regarded as a mixture of fock ( number ) states . in practice",
    ", this assumption can be guaranteed when the signal and decoy states are indistinguishable to the adversary party , eve , other than the photon - number information .",
    "otherwise , if eve is able to distinguish between signal and decoy states via other degrees of freedom , such as frequency and timing of the pulses , the security of the decoy - state protocol would fail @xcite . in the original proposals , on the transmitter s side , alice actively modulates the intensities of pulses to prepare decoy states through an optical intensity modulator , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modle ] ( a ) .",
    "this active decoy - state method , however , might leak the signal / decoy information to eve due to intensity modulation and increase the complexity of the system .",
    "( non - triggered ) and @xmath0 ( triggered ) , respectively .",
    "the inset shows the photon number distributions conditioned on the detection results of the idler mode.,width=264 ]    another type of protocols , passive decoy - state method , has been proposed , where the decoy states are prepared through measurements @xcite .",
    "the passive method can rely on the usage of a parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) source where the photon numbers of two output modes are strongly correlated . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : modle ] ( b ) , alice first generates photon pairs through a pdc process and then detects the idler photons as triggers . conditioned on alice s detection outcome of the idler mode , trigger ( @xmath0 ) or non - trigger ( @xmath1 ) , alice can infer the corresponding photon number statistics of the signal mode , and hence obtains two conditional states for the decoy - state method .",
    "the photon numbers of these two states follow different distributions as shown in appendix . from this point of view",
    ", the pdc source can be treated as a built - in decoy state source .",
    "note that passive decoy - state sources with non - poissonian light other than pdc sources are studied in @xcite . also , the pdc source can be used as a heralded single photon source in the active decoy - state method @xcite .",
    "the key advantage of the passive decoy - state method is that it can substantially reduce the possibility of signal / decoy information leakage @xcite .",
    "in addition , the phases of signal photons are totally random due to the spontaneous feature of the pdc process .",
    "this intrinsic phase randomization improves the security of the qkd system @xcite , by making it immune to source attacks @xcite .",
    "the critical experimental challenge to implement passive decoy - state qkd is that the error rate for the non - trigger case is very high due to high vacuum ration and background counts .",
    "besides , as a local detection , the idler photons do not suffer from the modulation loss and channel loss , so the counting rate of alice s detector is very high .",
    "due to the high dark count rate and low maximum counting rate , commercial ingaas / inp avalanche photodiodes ( apd ) are not suitable for these passive decoy - state qkd experiments . by developing up - conversion single photon detectors with high efficiency and low noise ,",
    "we are able to suppress the error rate in the non - trigger events .",
    "meanwhile , the up - conversion single photon detectors can reach a maximum counting rate of about 20 mhz .",
    "with such detectors , we demonstrates the passive decoy - state method over a 50-km - long optical fiber .",
    "for the decoy - state method , the photon number distribution of the source is crucial for data postprocessing @xcite .",
    "thus , we first investigate the photon number distribution of the pdc source used in the experiment , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] ( a ) .",
    "an electronically driven distributed feedback laser triggered by an arbitrary function generator is used to provide a 100 mhz pump pulse train . after being amplified by an erbium - doped fiber amplifier ( edfa ) , the laser pulses with a 1.4 ns fwhm duration and 1556.16 nm central wavelength pass through a 3 nm tunable bandpass filter to suppress the amplified spontaneous emission noise from the edfa .",
    "the light is then frequency doubled in a periodically poled lithium niobate ( ppln ) waveguide .",
    "since our waveguide only accepts tm - polarized light , an in - line fiber polarization controller is used to adjust the polarization of the input light .",
    "the generated second harmonic pulses are separated from the pump light by a short - pass filter with an extinction ratio of about 180 db , and then used to pump the second ppln waveguide to generate correlated photon pairs .",
    "both ppln waveguides are fiber pigtailed reverse - proton - exchange devices and each has a total loss of 5 db .",
    "the generated photon pairs are separated from the pump light of the second ppln waveguide by a long - pass filter with an extinction ratio of about 180 db . the down converted signal and idler photons are separated by a 100 ghz dense wavelength - division multiplexing ( dwdm ) fiber filter .",
    "the central wavelengths of the two output channels of the dwdm filter are 1553.36 nm and 1558.96 nm",
    ".     represents the time delay between the photons of the two bs output arms .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is @xmath3.,width=264 ]    for a spontaneous pdc process , the number of emitted photon pairs within a wave package follows a thermal distribution @xcite . in the case",
    "when the system pulse length is longer than the wave package length , the distribution can be calculated by taking the integral of thermal distributions . in the limit",
    "when the pulse length is much longer than the wave package length , the integrated distribution can be well estimated by a poisson distribution @xcite . in our experiment ,",
    "the pump pulse length is 1.4 ns , while the length of the down - conversion photon pair wave package is around 4 ps .",
    "therefore , the photon pair number statistics can be approximated by a poisson distribution . to verify this",
    ", we build a hanbury brown - twiss ( hbt ) setup @xcite by inserting a 50:50 beam splitter ( bs ) in the signal mode followed by two single photon detectors , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] ( a ) .",
    "both detection signals are feeded to a time correlated single photon counting ( tcspc ) module for time correlation measurement .",
    "a time window of 2 ns is used to select the counts within the pulse duration .",
    "the interval between the peaks of counts is 10 ns , which is consistent with the 100 mhz repetition rate of our source . after accumulating about 5000 counts per time bin",
    ", we calculate the value of the normalized second - order correlation function @xmath4 of the signal photons , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] ( b ) .",
    "the value of @xmath2 is @xmath3 , which confirms the poisson distribution of the photon pair number .",
    "our passive decoy - state qkd experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . the pdc source is placed on alice s side .",
    "the idler photons are detected by an up - conversion single photon detector whose outcomes are recorded by a field programable gate array ( fpga ) based data acquisition card and then transmitted to a computer .",
    "the up - conversion single photon detector used in our experiment consists of a frequency up - conversion stage in a nonlinear crystal followed by detection using a silicon apd ( sapd ) . as described in @xcite , a 1950 nm thulium doped fiber laser",
    "is employed as a pump light for a ppln waveguide , which is used to up - convert the wavelength of the idler photons to 866 nm .",
    "after filtering the pump and other noise in the up - conversion process , we detect the output photons with a sapd . by using the long - wavelength pump technology",
    ", we can suppress the noise to a very low level and achieve a detection efficiency of 15% and a dark count rate of 800 hz .        for signal photons ,",
    "we employ the phase - encoding scheme by using an unbalanced faraday - michelson interferometer and two phase modulators ( pm ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the time difference between two bins is about 3.7 ns .",
    "the two pms are driven by a 3.3 ghz pulse pattern generator ( ppg ) .",
    "the first pm is utilized to choose the @xmath5 or @xmath6 basis by modulating the relative phase of the two time bins into @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the second pm is utilized to choose the bit value by modulating the relative phase into @xmath8 .",
    "the encoded photons are transmitted to the receiver ( bob ) through optical fiber .",
    "bob chooses basis with a pm driven by another ppg and measures the relative phase of two time bins via an unbalanced interferometer with the same time difference of 3.7 ns .",
    "the random numbers used in the experiment are generated by a quantum random number generator ( idq quantis - oem ) beforehand and stored on the memory of the ppgs .",
    "the detection efficiency and dark count rate of the up - conversion detectors on bob s side are 14% and 800 hz , respectively .",
    "note that although the pm for encoding may also induces side channel leakage @xcite , the intent of this letter is to close the loophole due to the decoy state preparation , not to close all the loopholes in one experiment . and furthermore , we remark that bb84 qubit encoding can also be done via passive means @xcite .",
    "such step can be taken in future works .",
    "one challenge in the experimental setup is to stabilize the relative phase of two unbalanced arms in two separated unbalanced interferometers , which is very sensitive to temperature or mechanical vibration .",
    "we place a piezo - electric phase shifter in one arm of the interferometer on bob s side for active phase feedback . after every second of qkd",

    "details of decoy state estimation as well as the method of postprocessing and simulation used later can be found in appendix .",
    "we perform the passive decoy - state qkd over optical fibers of 0 km , 25 km and 50 km . for each distance",
    ", we run the system for 20 minutes , half of which is used for phase feedback control .",
    "thus the effective qkd time is 10 minutes and the system repetition rate is 100 mhz .",

    "the transmission loss of the pdc source is about 7 db , the total modulation loss caused by the two ufmis and the three pms is about 21 db .",
    "these losses result in a significantly reduced key rate .",
