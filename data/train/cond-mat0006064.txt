    "the average energy per site is @xmath49 since along horizontal lines , there is an alternating sequence of vertices of energies @xmath158 and @xmath17 . the total entropy of the @xmath157 lattice is of order @xmath159 since the vertical arrows are frozen and the horizontal ones along a row are identical . therefore the free energy _ per site _ becomes : @xmath160 and in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath161 , the entropic term can be neglected .",
    "this limiting value of the free energy is reproduced correctly by our mean - field calculations at all temperatures .",
    "the free energy for vicinal orientations very close to the @xmath30 type facets can also be calculated exactly .",
    "it just involves calculating the free energy of isolated steps on these facets .",
    "this calculation is worked out in the appendix .",
    "it turns out that our mean field approximation also describes the free energy of these vicinal orientations correctly .",
    "this is no surprise , since for these orientations crossings are very rare and unimportant , so that our method for estimating the entropy and the numbers of turns becomes exact .",
    "the other limiting case to be considered is the orientation with @xmath163 . in this case for @xmath154 ( [ mfree ] ) yields two minima with @xmath164 , which correspond to the two _ reconstructed _ manhattan states with @xmath165 .",
    "since the ground state energy of the system equals zero we expect that in reality @xmath166 at finite temperatures .",
    "the reason we do not find this in our mean field approximation is due to the fact that we have neglected correlations between directed walks .",
    "e.g.  at very low temperatures the most important excitations of the ground state are closed loops around an elementary square on the manhattan lattice .",
    "these obviously exhibit strong correlations ; four turns are located on the corners of the same elementary square .",
    "however , their contribution to @xmath167 is of the order @xmath168 and therefore ignoring these terms is consistent within our approximation scheme .",
    "above the temperature @xmath169 satisfying @xmath170 the minimum of ( [ fretomin ] ) corresponds to @xmath111 and the orientation @xmath162 is unreconstructed , with free energy given by ( [ freeunr ] ) , which is negative as expected .",
    "so for this orientation our mean field theory predicts a phase transition where the reconstruction order parameters ( @xmath108 and @xmath109 ) jump from @xmath6 to zero and the step free energy vanishes with a mean - field exponent @xmath134 as can be seen from the free energies ( [ recq = p ] ) and ( [ recp=0 ] ) .    transfer matrix calculations @xcite strongly suggest that in reality the reconstruction transition and the roughening transition occur at separate temperatures and that both are continuous .",
    "however , the temperature difference between the two transitions decreases very rapidly with increasing @xmath171 ( our estimates @xcite yield an approach as @xmath172 ) and , as @xmath171 gets larger the increase of @xmath173 from practically zero to appreciable values occurs within an increasingly narrow range of @xmath174 . since we expect our mean field approximation to become exact in the limit @xmath175 , the predicted coincidence of roughening and deconstruction as well as the first order character of this phase transition are in fact to be expected .      at the points @xmath176 and @xmath84 ,",
    "@xmath177 the reconstruction parameter @xmath108 becomes zero , as follows from eqs .",
    "( [ alq = p ] ) and ( [ alp=0 ] ) .",
    "one can find the locus @xmath178 for general @xmath24 and @xmath23 by setting @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 , @xmath182 and requiring that the matrix of the second derivatives of the free energy with respect to the parameters @xmath108 and @xmath109 has zero determinant for @xmath111 .",
    "this requirement yields the following condition : @xmath183 this line may be interpreted as a spinodal line for the reconstruction transition .",
    "its stable part describes a smooth boundary between reconstructed and unreconstructed regions . as we will see",
    "later part of this line is actually thermodynamically unstable .    at this point",
    "we should also discuss the symmetry properties of the surface and its free energy .",
    "obviously the latter should be invariant under the transformations @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "our expression for the unreconstructed free energy satisfies all these requirements .",
    "the one for the reconstructed free energy is invariant under the last transformation and under @xmath187 , but it is not invariant under reflection of @xmath24 or @xmath23 alone .",
    "a little thinking reveals that we have broken this symmetry by our identification of positive @xmath24 and @xmath23 with given arrow directions ; if one identifies the opposite horizontal arrow direction with positive @xmath24 _ and _ changes the sign of the actual horizontal polarization obviously our expression for the free energy does not change .",
    "so to restore the required symmetry one has to adopt the convention that positive @xmath24 and @xmath23 should correspond to the direction of the majority of the horizontal respectively vertical arrows .",
    "this does not look unreasonable : our mean field mean assumptions obviously work better the smaller the number of overturned arrows with respect to the fully polarized state . on the other hand , in stable reconstructed states",
    "the fraction of overturned arrows often is close to one half , so the mean field description used here may be less accurate than one might like .",
    "unstable or metastable regions on a free energy surface can be stabilized by applying a _",
    "maxwell construction_. this amounts to connecting all pairs of points on the free energy surface by tie lines , constructing the lower envelope of the free energy surface combined with the set of all the tie lines and putting this in place of the original free energy surface , and repeating this procedure until it converges .",
    "the new points that are generated this way represent  coexisting states \" of two or three stable orientations .",
    "in other words , the most favorable way for the crystal to realize surfaces of the corresponding orientations is by _ faceting _ , that is replacing these surfaces by a combination of two or three different surface elements with the same average orientation . surface orientations that give rise to faceting do not appear in the equilibrium shape of the crystal ; they are not thermodynamically stable .      the dashed lines in fig .",

    "i.e. of @xmath167 as a function of @xmath24 and @xmath23 , this is reflected in the form of a flat area for a certain range of orientations , namely those physically realizable orientations that are tangent at the conical point and all their convex combinations .",
    "the existence of such a flat area is a direct consequence of eq.([shape ] ) ; for different points on the @xmath275 surface to give rise to the same @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath190 they have to lie in a common plane . from a physical point of view",
    "the existence of such a flat area in the @xmath275 surface looks extremely surprising .",
    "it looks like having the possibility for a finite range of step densities for which the step dependent part of the free energy is strictly proportional to the step density , but gets no contributions whatever from interactions between the steps .",
    "it should be stressed however that so far almost all our evidence for the conical character of p is numerical .",
    "although the accuracy of our calculations is very high and all our results indicate conic behavior , we can not exclude the possibility that on an even finer scale the lines of various @xmath273 will not intersect exactly and in fact the single conical point p will extend into some folds and creases , the extension of which certainly has to be very small .",

    "[ fig07 ] merge into a single point . according to eq .",
    "( [ recq = p ] ) all orientations @xmath138 with @xmath276 indeed join in the point p. this is a limiting case of a conical point , where the opening angle of the cone becomes zero .",
    "there seems as little physical reason for the coincidence of all these orientations in p as in the general case , but of course this does not provide a proof for conical behavior in general .",
    "notice that in a previous mean - field calculation @xcite the two facets @xmath80 and @xmath30 where found connected under a sharp edge at large @xmath24 and @xmath23 values .",
    "this is an artefact of that approach , which has the following drawbacks : in that description the starting point of the mean - field calculation was the manhattan lattice .",
    "therefore the description of the orientations near the @xmath30 type facets is less accurate than in the present method .",
    "but it now turns out that , besides the facet orientations , these are the only ones that are actually found in the equilibrium shapes at low temperatures .",
    "in addition both mean field approximations give the same result for the free energy of the ( 001)-facet , so no accuracy is lost there .",
    "finally the present mean field approximation is much more amenable to analytic treatment and for instance symmetries under sublattice exchange and/or arrow reversal remain much more transparent .",
    "the model studied in this paper is expected to give a fairly good description of surfaces of ionic crystals of bcc type , such as cscl .",
    "we find an equilibrium shape with extended facets and mostly sharp edges for the ( 001 ) facet at low temperatures .",
    "the shape is very rich and exhibits critical points of various nature , such as triple , tricritical and conical points .",
    "this richness stems from the fact that , besides the facet edges of the ( 001 ) and ( 011 ) facets the model also has boundaries between reconstructed and unreconstructed regions .",
    "the interplay between the former and the latter produces such a rich phase diagram .",
    "there exists a fair number of other models for equilibrium shapes which have been solved either in mean - field approximation or by transfer matrix methods , but we are not aware of cases where the shape is as complex as in the case presented here . particularly striking is the likely appearance of conical points , which , as pointed out above , have a special degeneracy , i.e. a continuous set of different slopes @xmath24 and @xmath23 coexist in such points . indicating the coordinates of the conical point with ( @xmath277 , @xmath278 , @xmath279 ) we have from eq .",
    "( [ shape ] ) : @xmath280 , i.e. the coexisting set of orientations @xmath24 and @xmath23 is such that their surface free energy has the form of a planar facet in the @xmath281 surface .",
    "notice that the opposite situation is much more common and easier to understan d physically , i.e. a singular point of conical type in @xmath275 produces a facet in @xmath266 .    finally , it is interesting to point out that shapes of @xmath282 crystals in thermal equilibrium were investigated by heyraud and mtois @xcite .",
    "they found that the shape of the crystal is a perfect cube up to a temperature @xmath283 and that the roughening of the crystal starts from the corners of the cube and extends towards the edges .",
    "hence , it seems that the presence of sharp facet boundaries , persisting at high temperature , is a common feature of crystals of ionic type @xcite .",
