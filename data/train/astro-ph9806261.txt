    "ngc  1705 , at a distance @xmath3 mpc ( for @xmath4 ; meurer et al .  1995 ; hereafter m95 ) , is a relatively nearby blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy , which in an earlier paper ( meurer et al .",
    "1992 ; hereafter paper i ) , we showed had several remarkable features . these include : ( 1 ) a prominent @xmath5 `` super star cluster '' , previously noted by melnick , moles , terlevich , which we refer to as ngc1705 - 1 following m95 ; ( 2 ) less luminous star clusters ,  regions and a diffuse distribution of massive stars which along with ngc1705 - 1 comprise an intense ongoing starburst ( see also m95 ) ; and ( 3 ) a spectacular galactic wind ( see also marlowe et al .",
    "1995 ) , which is powered by this starburst .",
    "ngc  1705 s explosive  morphology of multiple loops and arcs extends out to the holmberg radius @xmath6 kpc and is accompanied by split emission lines .",
    "the expulsive nature of the flow is confirmed by uv absorption line kinematics ( heckman & leitherer , 1997 ; sahu &  blades , 1997 ) .",
    "table  [ t : prop ] lists some useful properties of ngc  1705 derived from paper i , m95 , or this work .    .derived and adopted parameters for ngc  1705[t : prop ] [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mass model fits employed the @xmath7 minimization code employed by m96 .",
    "all models shown have fixed . in most cases they are maximum disk solutions where the maximum  value is determined that will allow the innermost @xmath8 measurement to be be modelled entirely by the stellar and ism contributions .",
    "the adopted  is then set at 90%  of this value , reduced so that the dm core is not hollow ( cf .",
    "van albada et al .  1985 ) .",
    "we prefer maximum disk models because there are not enough data to meaningfully fit  ( see below ) ; the photometric profile only covers the innermost two points of the rotation curve .",
    "furthermore , these models minimize the contribution of the halo .",
    "the fact that the halo dominates in all fits shows that it is a necessary component of the mass distribution .    in all models shown , the geometries of the stellar and neutral gas distributions are assumed to be circularly symmetric razor thin disks , while the dm halo is assumed to be spherically symmetric .",
    "these standard assumptions for modelling rotation curves , are of course highly idealised . considering that the disks in ngc  1705 may be rather thick , and/or warped , we also constructed models with spherically symmetric distributions ( having the same enclosed @xmath9 relationship ) for the gas and stars .",
    "this decreases both the maximum amplitude of the rotation curve of the two disk components , and the radius at this maximum . for maximum stellar disk models , this results in a somewhat lower , since the peak then occurs somewhat closer to the innermost @xmath8 measurement , and consequently a lower  is required to reach the same amplitude .",
    "however the assumptions about the geometry of the luminous components has only a minor affect on the dm halo properties ( @xmath10%  for @xmath11 and @xmath12 ; @xmath13  for @xmath14 ) , since the halo is so dominant in all cases .",
    "model aa shows the maximum disk model for the observed rotation curve .",
    "the derived @xmath15 is close to the @xmath16 level estimated in paper i from the hsb and lsb stellar populations colours .",
    "model bb is a fit to the same data assuming a minimum stellar disk , i.e.  @xmath17 , resulting in dm halo with a core @xmath18%  smaller and denser by @xmath19% . when  is a free parameter our minimization code also yields @xmath17 , that is , no stellar component is required to fit these data .",
    "this is a common result when mass modelling rotation curves @xcite , and indicates that the rotation curves do not often well constrain the relative contribution of the stellar component even in the core of galaxies - there is a degeneracy between  and @xmath12 .",
    "the minimum disk model yields the maximum dm @xmath12 allowed by these data , or equivalently the total spherically averaged dm plus stellar density within the constant density core of the galaxy . a comparison of @xmath12 in models aa and bb indicate that dm dominates even in the core of ngc  1705 .",
    "models aa and bb were fitted to the raw rotation curve derived in section [ ss : rc ] .",
    "however , as noted in section [ ss : ps ] , in the inner most portion of the rotation curve may be underestimated due to beam smearing and or pressure support .",
    "model cc is a maximum disk fit to the rotation curve corrected for maximum pressure support shown in fig .",
    "[ f : rc ] .",
    "a significantly higher  than in model aa is needed to meet the maximum disk constraint .",
    "even so , @xmath12 is almost twice that in model aa , and @xmath11 is smaller by 35% .",
    "note that there is little effect on @xmath14 ( it actually goes down slightly ) .",
    "this is because it is essentially set by the flat part of the rotation curve",
    ".    the maximum pressure support corrections may be insufficient to recover the true  profile .",
    "beam smearing and warping of the  disk may further lower  over its initial rise .",
    "it is impossible to sort out all these effects with the data in hand .",
    "instead , we construct an idealized rotation curve based on the shape of normal galaxy rotation curves , and scaled to the properties of ngc  1705 .",
    "it features a linearly rising inner portion and a flat rotation curve thereafter .",
    "the turnover is set to occur where the stellar disk rotation curve should peak , while the flat part at @xmath20 is set as the mean of the last five points in table  [ t : rc ] .",
    "model dd is the maximum disk fit to this hypothetical rotation curve .",
    "this results in the highest  of our models . compared to model aa , @xmath11 is smaller by 30%  and @xmath12 is larger by over 40% , while @xmath14 is lower by 14% .",
    "the main conclusion from our mass models is that in all cases a dominant dm halo is required .",
    "moreover , the central density @xmath21 is rather large compared to other disk galaxies .",
    "this result is discussed in detail in section [ ss : ev ] .",
    "our study shows that ngc  1705 has a lopsided and disturbed appearance suggesting that an interaction or merger has triggered the starburst in this system .",
    "although this is a very appealing scenario , it is not clear what it is interacting with .",
    "ngc  1705 inhabits a low density environment .",
    "there are no galaxies of comparable brightness or size in the 15@xmath22 ( 27 kpc ) field centred on ngc  1705 visible on the uk schmidt telescope survey .",
    "we used ned to search for possible companions within 5@xmath23 ( 0.54 mpc in projection ) and found no likely companions . over this area",
    "there are only two galaxies as bright or brighter than ngc  1705 : ngc  1596 and ngc  1617 .",
    "these have significantly higher @xmath24 ( 1510 and 1063  respectively ) indicating that they are background galaxies .",
    "the nearest catalogued group of galaxies is the ngc  1672 group , with eight known member @xcite , at @xmath25  and a projected separation of @xmath26 mpc .",
    "we searched our data for possible companions . to do this",
    "we made a special purpose na data cube with a pixel size @xmath27 in the spatial direction ( yielding a synthesized beam width of 44@xmath22 ) and 13.2  in velocity , and large enough to easily encompass the atca primary beam fwhm @xmath28 ( @xmath29 kpc ) .",
    "the useful velocity range of this cube is @xmath30 ( i.e.  @xmath31 ) .",
    "we examined the data cube in a variety of ways , but found no obvious companions .",
    "the estimated @xmath32 detection limit corresponds to @xmath33 for a point source of narrow velocity width ( @xmath34 ) located at the field centre .",
    "however , the area we surveyed is small compared to that used by taylor et al .   study . of the  galaxy companions ,",
    "@xmath19%  have projected separations @xmath35 kpc .",
    "hence there may be a companion beyond the area we surveyed .",
    "perhaps the  spur is actually a companion galaxy . if so it must have a low stellar content since the image of ngc  1705 in the eso - lv catalogue @xcite shows no optical counterpart to the spur , down to its detection limit of @xmath36 .",
    "an examination of the na data cube reveals that the spur is attached to the main body of the system both spatially , and in @xmath24 , suggesting that if it is a companion , it is strongly interacting or merging with ngc  1705 .",
    "however , ngc  1705 s outer optical isophotes are round and regular , suggesting a relatively peaceful environment .",
    "this is in contrast to the best studied merger - bcd : iizw40 ( brinks &  klein , 1988 ; van zee , skillman , &  salzer 1998 ) which has a highly disturbed `` @xmath37 '' structure even at low surface brightness levels ( marlowe et al .",
    "1997 ; telles , melnick , &  terlevich 1997 ) .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence that the spur is a companion galaxy and hence we have not found any convincing external trigger to ngc  1705 s starburst .      in the standard theory of galactic winds @xcite the wind expansion is powered by a very hot , @xmath38 k , over - pressurized bubble of thermalized supernovae remnants and stellar winds , which are abundantly produced in a starburst . as it expands the bubble sweeps up the ambient ism into a shell like structure .",
    "once it expands to one or two disk scale heights it will accelerate out along the minor axis , resulting in shell fragmentation . the enclosed hot gas will then `` blow out '' , escaping into the halo .",
    "we propose that the  spur results from such a galactic wind blow out .",
    "the evidence is as follows .",
    "firstly , the orientation of the spur is consistent with the optical outflow .",
    "the position angle of the spur @xmath39 relative to the optical centre , while the  outflow axis @xmath40 ( paper i ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath24 increases gradually with distance from the optical centre , the same sense as the optical velocity gradient on the nnw side of the outflow .",
    "secondly , the one - sided nature of the spur is predicted by models of galactic winds . if the energy source is displaced off of the disk plane , the blow out will occur only on the side to which the source is displaced ( mac low , mccray , norman 1989 ) .",
    "indeed , the spur is displaced on the same side of the  disk plane as the optical centroid .",
    "thirdly , the ism is very porous towards the optical centre of ngc  1705 .",
    "heckman &  leitherer estimate @xmath41 towards ngc1705 - 1 from the absorption profile obtained with the hubble space telescope , over ten times lower than what we find @xmath42 averaged over the un beam .",
    "the observed weakness , and porosity in the ism suggests that the hot bubble has already punched through the ambient ism .",
    "finally , the scale size of the spur , 4.5 kpc , agrees with expectations .",
    "once the blow out occurs , the hot gas will expand at thermal velocities and adiabatically cool .",
    "the thermal velocity for @xmath43 k is 280  for an h atom .",
    "thus over a 10 myr time - scale ( the optical expansion time - scale ) , gas from the blow - out can travel nearly 3 kpc , 3/4 the length of the spur .",
    "one problem with this scenario is that it implies that the outflow vector must be inclined within only a few degrees of the plane of the sky , otherwise the spur would have a much larger @xmath24 difference with respect to @xmath44 , ( i.e.  even larger than @xmath45 derived in paper i for the  outflow ) .",
    "however , ngc1705 - 1 is but the brightest cluster formed within the young central stellar population population .",
    "so perhaps earlier star formation events expelled the spur at lower velocities .",
    "at a minimum , the velocity of the spur is @xmath46 , the @xmath24 difference with respect to @xmath44 , yielding a maximum expansion time - scale of about 100 myr .    what will become of the galactic wind ?",
    "already some of it has travelled @xmath47 kpc - well into the halo .",
    "the escape speed @xmath48 at radius @xmath49 within an isothermal sphere truncated at @xmath50 is given by @xmath51^{1/2}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the circular velocity .",
    "thus if the spur is travelling at 280  at @xmath53 kpc , the dm halo would have to extend out to @xmath46 mpc to contain the outflow .",
    "this is implausibly large , hence the spur will escape .",
    "if @xmath50 is as low as 7 kpc ( the limits of the  data ) the spur need only be travelling at 120  for it to escape .",
    "the neutral gas ( h + he ) mass of the spur is @xmath54 , about 8%  of the total gas mass . if it results from an outflow , then the range of plausible time scales ( @xmath55 myr ) imply mass loss rates of @xmath56 , into the dm dominated halo if not out of the system entirely .",
    "this is roughly equal to or up to an order of magnitude larger than the _ current _ total star formation rate of @xmath57 as derived from the  flux ( paper i ) and the conversion factor of kennicutt .",
    "the link between star formation and the gravitational stability of the ism in a disk has been noted by several authors over the past few decades .",
    "( e.g.  quirk , 1972 ; kennicutt 1989 ) .",
    "if the disk is sufficiently cool and dense its thermal pressure and centripetal acceleration can not support itself against self gravity and the disk will fragment , presumably leading to efficient star formation .",
    "the gravitational stability of a gaseous disk is given by the toomre @xmath58 parameter : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the gas velocity dispersion , @xmath61 is the gas disk surface density and @xmath62 is the epicyclic frequency for angular frequency @xmath63 .",
    "high values of @xmath58 mean the disk is more stable while if @xmath64 then the disk should fragment .",
    "kennicutt empirically found that in normal disk galaxies , high mass star formation occurs in regions having @xmath65 .",
    "the same threshold also is able to predict the location of star formation in low surface brightness galaxies @xcite and bcd/  galaxies @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f : qprof ] shows ngc  1705 s azimuthally averaged @xmath58 profile for the minimum and maximum @xmath66 curves of fig .",
    "[ f : rc ] . here",
    "@xmath8 is interpolated smoothly ( spline fit ) through the points given in table  [ t : rc ] .",
    "the @xmath61 profile is taken as the neutral gas surface density profile fits given in eq .",
    "[ e : fcprof ] .",
    "two fiducial radii are indicated in this plot : @xmath67 which encompasses most of the stellar light , and the  effective radius @xcite which encompasses most or all of the high mass star formation .",
    "we see that the @xmath58 profiles has a sharp down - turn corresponding to the optical extent of the galaxy and that high mass star formation is limited to the region where the @xmath58 profile bottoms out .",
    "conversely , the outer  disk ( beyond @xmath68 ) is relatively stable with @xmath58 a factor of 5 - 10 higher than in the centre of the galaxy .",
    "when the minimum @xmath66 profile is adopted the central values of @xmath58 in ngc  1705 are close to kennicutt s threshold value . considering the limited resolution of the data and the neglect of molecular gas and elements heavier than helium",
    ", we may expect that the disk is even less stable in the centre .",
    "the maximum @xmath66 version of the @xmath58 profile is significantly above kennicutt s threshold at all radii .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that kennicutt as well as van der hulst et al .   and taylor et al .",
    "@xmath69 at all radii .",
    "thus the threshold @xmath58 has yet to be calibrated with true measured @xmath60 profiles .",
    "we conclude that ngc  1705 is like most other galaxies in that star formation occurs where the disk is least stable .",
    "one important difference between bcds and di galaxies is in the central densities @xmath12 of their dm halos , as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : halocor ] .",
    "the majority of the data comes from the uniform mass model fitting of de blok &  mcgaugh .",
    "since we are concerned with dwarf galaxy properties we limit their sample to systems with @xmath70 .",
    "these galaxies mostly have sm or later morphological types ( i.e.  di galaxies ) , although there are a few sd galaxies particularly at @xmath71 .",
    "the two bcds are ngc  1705 , from this study , and ngc  2915 from m96 .",
    "both panels plot @xmath12 of the dm halo against the optical @xmath72 band central surface brightness @xmath73 .",
    "for ngc  1705 we adopt @xmath12 from model aa , since this gives the most conservative results .",
    "the top panel shows the results of maximum disk models . since maximum disk models correspond to minimum halo models , the @xmath12 plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : halocor]a should be considered lower limits .",
    "in order to break the degeneracy between  and @xmath12 de blok &  mcgaugh employ `` bottema disk '' model fits ; their results are plotted in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ f : halocor ] . for these",
    "is set by the @xmath74 colour of the galaxy , rather than the rotation curve .",
    "following their prescription and the photometry in paper i we obtain @xmath75  for ngc  1705 .",
    "this value is higher than the maximum disk , and following de blok &  mcgaugh we adopt the maximum disk  results ( model aa ) for the bottema disk solution .",
    "since ngc  2915 was not modelled with a bottema disk by m96 , we estimate the bottema disk results here . from the prescription of de blok &  mcgaugh and the the photometry of longo &  de vaucouleurs we obtain a bottema disk @xmath76  for ngc  2915 .",
    "this is slightly less than the maximum disk  in m96 s model d. by interpolation between their models a and d and correcting to @xmath77 we estimate @xmath78 for the bottema disk solution .",
    "figure  [ f : halocor ] shows that the two bcds have some of the highest @xmath12 of any of the dwarf galaxies in the sample .",
    "furthermore there is a weak but noticeable correlation between @xmath79 and @xmath73 , with higher surface brightness disks corresponding to higher @xmath12 halos .",
    "these results hold for both maximum disk and bottema disk solutions .",
    "this result ( for bottema disks ) was noted first by de blok &  mcgaugh , and extends to high luminosity disks .",
    "here we show that the correlation also includes blue compact dwarf galaxies .",
    "the rms scatter in @xmath79 about simple linear fits to the data is @xmath80 dex ( see fig  [ f : halocor ] caption ) .",
    "a large part of this may be due to measurement uncertainties ; as noted the pressure support or beam smearing corrections can change @xmath79 by 0.3 dex , while distance errors can easily translate into a 0.2 dex uncertainty in @xmath79 for galaxies with @xmath81 mpc .",
    "the fact that the two bcds are on the right side of the diagram while most of the dis are on the left side is not a coincidence .",
    "it has been noted by several authors ( papaderos et al .",
    "1996 ; telles &  terlevich , 1997 ; marlowe , meurer , &  heckman 1998 ) that the enveloping exponential profile of bcds have brighter @xmath73 than dis by typically @xmath822.5 mag arcsec@xmath83 @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath73 plotted here excludes any central excess of light above the usual exponential profile seen at large radii .",
    "such an excess of light is commonly found in bcd galaxies and usually is identified as the starburst @xcite .",
    "they are also common in di galaxies , but at a lower intensity @xcite , and hence are not classified as starbursts .    what is the explanation of the differences between bcds and dis apparent in fig .",
    "[ f : halocor ] ?",
    "we suggest that dm halos regulate the morphology of dwarf galaxies via the stability of their inner disks .",
    "both types of dwarfs are usually dm dominated at nearly all radii , and typically have solid body rotation curves over their optical extents .",
    "let us assume that star formation occurs at the same @xmath58 value in all types of dwarf galaxies , and moreover that @xmath58 is regulated to maintain this level , at least over the optical extent of the galaxy ( cf.ferguson , 1997 ; kennicutt , 1989 ) .",
    "for a given @xmath58 , in the solid body portion of the rotation curve @xmath84 ( from eq .",
    "[ e : q ] and [ e : k ] ) .",
    "kennicutt finds that the the global star formation rate per unit area in disk galaxies @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the dynamical time scale .",
    "combining this with our constant @xmath58 assumption leads to @xmath87 the optical luminosity of both dis and bcds are usually dominated by young blue stars , so the star formation rate per area is proportional to surface brightness . hence the @xmath88 dex difference in @xmath12 between dis and bcds should correspond to a factor of ten difference in linear surface brightness , or 2.5 mag arcsec@xmath83 .",
    "the best fit line with this slope is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : halocor ] .",
    "we see that this scenario can explain the basic trend seen in the data .",
    "we emphasize that this model explains the differences in the exponential envelopes @xmath73 of gas rich dwarfs and does not address the starburst nature of bcds . as shown by marlowe et al .",
    "the starburst typically is at best a modest enhancement to the luminosity of a bcd and contributes only a few percent to the stellar mass of the host .    while the scatter in fig .",
    "[ f : halocor ] allows for some evolution in surface brightness , our scenario implies that an extreme di galaxy can not evolve into an extreme bcd , or visa - versa .",
    "this would involve a factor of 10 change in @xmath12 , or expansion / contraction of the halo by a factor of @xmath89 .",
    "this is very difficult to do if dm is non - dissipitive , and since even the cores are dm dominated , a baryonic ( luminous matter ) collapse or blowout would be insufficient to drag the dm with it .",
    "we have examined the  distribution and dynamics of the windy blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxy ngc  1705 .",
    "while a rotating disk dominates the  distribution , the  distribution appears somewhat disturbed .",
    "the optical centre and  peak are both offset from the  dynamical centre radially and off of the  plane .",
    "the total projected offset amounts to about 1.1 kpc .",
    "in addition there is an extraplanar  spur extending at least 4.5 kpc into the halo which accounts for @xmath0%of the total  mass .",
    "we argue that it is likely to have a galactic wind origin , perhaps being the adiabatically cooled hot bubble that formerly powered ngc  1705 s spectacular  outflow .",
    "higher resolution observations could shed more light on this issue .",
    "ngc  1705 s rotation curve is similar in form to those of other gas rich dwarf galaxies , having a linearly rising ( solid body ) inner portion and then turning over to become approximately flat ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "mass model fitting shows that the dark matter ( dm ) halo is dominant at nearly all radii - even into the solid body core of the galaxy .",
    "the models yield a dm halo central density @xmath91 , which is about a factor of ten times higher than typically found in dwarf irregular ( di ) galaxies , but similar to that found in ngc  2915 the only other mass - modelled bcd .",
    "firstly , if ngc  1705 s  spur is wind ejecta , then @xmath92 of neutral ism is being expelled at least into the halo if not out of the system entirely .",
    "this is occurring over a time - scale between roughly 10 myr and 100 myr ; yielding mass loss rates between 0.2 and 2  @xmath93 .",
    "this is a significant mass loss event , up to an order of magnitude larger than the current star formation rate .",
    "however , we emphasize that the vast majority of the neutral ism remains in a disk structure .    secondly , it is not clear from this study what triggered the starburst in ngc  1705 .",
    "no clear external trigger was identified in our data , nor in catalogue searches . a secular origin for the starburst may also be tenable :",
    "star formation in this galaxy occurs where the disk is least stable to self gravitation - just as is seen in normal disk galaxies .",
    "thirdly , the large difference in dm halo central densities between bcds and dis strongly indicates that there is little evolution between the two types .",
    "this is consistent with the differences found between the optical structure of dis and the host galaxies of bcds ( i.e.  excluding the starburst ; marlowe et al .",
    "1998 ) .    finally , we argue that dominant dm halos can regulate star formation in dwarf galaxies .",
    "this is done by setting the critical surface density for self gravitation ( and hence star formation ) of the embedded baryonic disk . in this scenario surface brightness",
    "is correlated with @xmath12 so that bcds should have stellar disk surface brightnesses @xmath82 2.5 mag arcsec@xmath83 brighter than dis , as is typically observed .",

    "<S> an extraplanar  spur accounts for @xmath0%  of the total  mass , and is possibly associated with the  outflow . the inferred mass loss rate out of the galaxy s core is significant @xmath1 , but does not dominate the  dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> mass model fits to the rotation curve show that the dark matter ( dm ) halo is dominant at nearly all radii and has a central density @xmath2 : ten times higher than typically found in dwarf irregular galaxies , but similar to the only other mass - modelled blue compact dwarf , ngc  2915 . </S>",
    "<S> this large difference strongly indicates that there is little evolution between dwarf irregular and blue compact dwarf types . instead , dominant dm halos may regulate the morphology of dwarf galaxies by setting the critical surface density for disk star formation . </S>",
