    "according to the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) data  @xcite and other observations , it seems incontestable that the large scale structure of the universe stems from quantum fluctuations during the slow - roll inflation .",
    "considering the accuracy of future observations , we expect higher order corrections to the simplest inflation model become important .",
    "hence , it would be worth to study the corrections due to higher curvature terms to the slow - roll inflation . to the leading order ,",
    "the corrections come from the gauss - bonnet and the axion - like parity violating coupling terms  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the same type of corrections can be derived from a particular superstring theory  @xcite . at present , however , we have not fully understood such corrections based on superstring theory .",
    "hence , we have to resort to the phenomenological approach .",
    "we hope the understanding of higher curvature corrections to the inflationary scenario provides a clue to the study of superstring theory .",
    "there have been many works concerning the gauss - bonnet and the parity violating corrections to the einstein gravity .",
    "it is known that gauss - bonnet term can provide non - singular cosmological solutions  @xcite and also provide alternative explanation for dark - energy  @xcite .",
    "there are many works on scalar and tensor perturbations in gauss - bonnet cosmology  .",
    "the parity violating term has been considered in conjunction with the circular polarization of gravitational waves  @xcite . however , since no one has systematically investigated both terms simultaneously in the context of the slow - roll inflation , the combined effect on the slow - roll inflation is not so clear . moreover ,",
    "observational implications have not been discussed so far .",
    "hence , a systematic study of higher curvature corrections to slow - roll inflationary scenario is desired .    in this paper",
    ", we study the slow - roll inflation with higher curvature corrections and derive the formula for the observables in terms of slow - roll parameters .",
    "it is stressed that the corrections could be relevant to observables in spite of the fact that its energetic contribution can be negligible .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the gauss - bonnet term behaves as an effective potential term in the scalar field equation , though it does not contribute to the friedmann equation in the slow - roll approximation .",
    "it reminds us of a hybrid model .",
    "that is why the effect could alter the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "there is also an effect of the parity violating term on the gravitational waves as the leading effect .",
    "in fact , the circular polarization will be produced during the slow - roll inflation , which never occurs in the conventional inflationary scenario .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we define slow - roll parameters in the inflationary scenario with higher curvature corrections . in section iii , we calculate the scalar spectral index . in section iv , we obtain the tensor spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio . here",
    ", we show the possibility of the enhancement of the tensor - to - scalar ratio due to the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "we also estimate the degree of the circular polarization of the primordial gravitational waves . in section",
    "v , the concrete examples are presented as an illustration .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we will identify the slow - roll parameters .",
    "since the parity violating term is not relevant to the background evolution , we have the corrections solely from the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "what we shall do is to characterize the correction in terms of the newly defined slow - roll parameters .",
    "we consider the gravitational action with the gauss - bonnet and the parity violating terms @xmath0 \\nonumber\\\\   & \\qquad \\qquad    -\\frac{1}{16}\\int{\\rm d}^4x\\sqrt{-g } \\xi ( \\phi)r^2_{\\rm gb }   + \\frac{1}{16 }   \\int{\\rm d}^4x\\sqrt{-g } \\omega ( \\phi)r\\tilde{r } \\ ,",
    "\\label{act}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 denotes the reduced planck mass and @xmath2 is the metric tensor .",
    "the gauss - bonnet term @xmath3 and the parity violating term @xmath4 are defined by @xmath5 the inflaton field @xmath6 has the potential @xmath7 .",
    "we have introduced coupling functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 . in principle , these functions should be calculated from the fundamental theory , such as superstring theory .",
    "hence , it might be important to put constraints on these functions through observations .",
    "let us take the flat friedmann - robertson - walker(frw ) metric @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the scale factor . from the action ( [ act ] ) ,",
    "we obtain following background equations @xmath12 where a dot denotes the derivative with respect to the cosmic time , and @xmath13 is the hubble parameter defined by @xmath14 .",
    "note that coupling function @xmath15 works as the effective potential for the inflaton @xmath6 , and only the gauss - bonnet coupling @xmath15 appears in background equations because of parity symmetry of frw metric .",
    "we will see the effect of the parity violating term appears only in tensor perturbations .",
    "we consider the friction - dominated slow - roll inflation phase where the following inequalities hold : @xmath16 under these circumstances , eq.([eq1 ] ) reads @xmath17 this is nothing but the conventional slow - roll friedman equation .",
    "while , the scalar field equation ( [ eq2 ] ) becomes @xmath18 here , the higher curvature correction plays a roll .",
    "if the last term can be neglected , we have the conventional slow - roll inflationary scenario . on the other hand ,",
    "if the last term becomes important , the situation is different .",
    "namely , the inflation is driven by the potential @xmath19 , whereas the dynamics of the scalar field is determined by the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "now , we need to check the consistency conditions .",
    "the consistency condition for ( [ eq11 ] ) reads @xmath20 and @xmath21 third consistency condition for eq.([eq11 ] ) leads to @xmath22 taking time derivative of eq.([eq22 ] ) , we get another consistency condition @xmath23 for the slow - roll assumption to be valid , these terms must be sufficiently small .",
    "hence , we define _ five _ slow - roll parameters , @xmath24 and impose the conditions @xmath25 . if these five conditions are satisfied , the inflaton field @xmath6 rolls down the potential slowly .",
    "note that , due to the gauss - bonnet term , the number of parameters and accompanying conditions increased from two for the conventional slow - roll inflation to five for this case .",
    "what we want to know is the effect of new parameters @xmath26 on the cosmological fluctuations .    for later convenience",
    ", we define @xmath27 and @xmath28 as @xmath29 it is also useful to notice the following relation @xmath30 from the next section , we study corrections to cosmological perturbations due to higher curvature terms .",
    "in this section , we study the higher curvature corrections to the scalar perturbations .",
    "it is convenient to use conformal time @xmath31 , defined as @xmath32 , rather than the cosmic time @xmath33 .",
    "we consider the scalar perturbations @xmath34 , and @xmath35 defined by the perturbed metric @xmath36   \\ ,   \\label{frw_s}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the bar denotes the spatial derivative and the prime represents the derivative with respect to the conformal time . here",

    "it is also straightforward to obtain the action for @xmath43 from the result .    using fourier expansion of @xmath43 @xmath44",
    "we can write down the action for @xmath45 @xmath46 where we have defined @xmath47 \\ ,    \\\\",
    "c_\\psi^2&\\equiv   \\frac{2}{a_\\psi^2}\\left\\ {   \\left[\\frac{a(1-\\sigma/2)^2}{h(1 - 3\\sigma/4)}\\right ] '   -a^2\\left(1-\\frac{\\ddot{\\xi}}{2m_{\\rm pl}^2}\\right )   \\right\\ } \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that , due to the parity symmetry in scalar modes , there never appears the effect of the coupling function @xmath9 in the action .",
    "defining a new variable @xmath48 , we obtain the canonical action @xmath49 this gives the schrodinger type equation @xmath50 notice that the term @xmath51 behaves as an effective potential , and @xmath52 behaves as an effective sound speed .",
    "we shall quantize the field @xmath53 by promoting it to the operator .",
    "we can use the mode expansion @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are annihilation and creation operators .",
    "the mode function @xmath57 satisfies the same equation as @xmath53 @xmath58 under the slow - roll conditions , @xmath59 can be approximated as @xmath60   = a^2\\rho^2   = a^2(2\\epsilon+4\\alpha/3+\\gamma/2 )   \\ ,   \\label{a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have kept terms to the leading order in slow - roll parameters .",
    "similarly , @xmath52 can be calculated as @xmath61   =   \\frac{2}{\\rho^2}\\left [   \\left(1-\\frac{\\dot{h}}{h^2}\\right)(1-\\sigma/4 )   -1+\\frac{\\ddot{\\xi}}{2m_{\\rm pl}^2 }   \\right ] \\",
    ".\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term can be negligible as is seen from the following calculation @xmath62 thus , we have @xmath63 where @xmath64 represents the first order corrections in slow - roll parameters .",
    "now , let us calculate the effective potential . using the relation @xmath65 we obtain @xmath66 from eq.([hdot2 ] ) , we deduce @xmath67 we integrate this equation to get @xmath39 as @xmath68 where we assumed @xmath69 . hence , we reached the following result @xmath70 thus , we can get the effective potential @xmath71 where we have defined @xmath72 now , eq.([eom_psi ] ) reduces to @xmath73 in the asymptotic past @xmath74 , the effective potential vanishes .",
    "hence , we can specify the bunch - davies vacuum by choosing the positive frequency mode function there as @xmath75 it is easy to find the corresponding mode function @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the first kind of hunkel function .",
    "asymptotic form of @xmath57 outside the horizon @xmath78 reads @xmath79 the power spectrum of scalar perturbation @xmath80 can be defined as @xmath81 thus , we obtain @xmath82 from eqs.([a ] ) and ( [ conhub ] ) , we have @xmath83 using the above relation , we can simplify the power spectrum as @xmath84 then , the scalar spectral index @xmath85 is given by @xmath86 of course , in the absence of the gauss - bonnet term , @xmath87 , we recover the conventional formula .",
    "in this section , we compute the power spectrum for tensor perturbations . in addition to the spectral index and the amplitude",
    ", we also calculate the circular polarization of gravitational waves .",
    "the metric we consider is @xmath88   \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is a transverse and traceless tensor .",
    "let us expand @xmath89 in plain waves and circular polarization tensor as @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes polarization tensor for circular polarization , and @xmath92 denotes helicity of each mode .",
    "the action for @xmath93 becomes , @xmath94 where @xmath95 note that there exists helicity dependence both in @xmath96 and @xmath97 , although we use notation @xmath96 and @xmath97 rather than @xmath98 and @xmath99 , for simplicity . apparently , the parity violating term gives rise to the left - right asymmetry , and hence the circular polarization of primordial gravitational waves .",
    "the observability of the circular polarization depends on the amplitude of the gravitational waves and the degree of the polarization .",
    "since the parity violating term does not affect the background evolution and scalar perturbations , the coupling function @xmath100 can not be constrained strongly . here",
    ", we only require the absence of the ghost gravitons . from eq.([ah ] ) , we see a serious problem would appear if the parity violating term become dominant . in that case , @xmath92 sign appears as the overall factor of the action , and that means the appearance of ghost in the gravitational waves .",
    "in other words , we can not trust our treatment of the gravitational waves in this regime .",
    "hence , we impose that the term @xmath101 must be lesser than @xmath102 at @xmath103 , @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the physical wave - number corresponding to the cut - off scale , _",
    "e.g. _ string scale , and we have defined @xmath106 here , since we are considering slow - roll inflation , we assumed @xmath107 in the period of interest .",
    "the amplitude of gravitational waves is determined at the horizon - crossing , @xmath108 .",
    "thus , the effect of the parity violating term can be estimated as @xmath109 where we have used the constraint ( [ const1 ] ) in the last inequality .",
    "in other words , we can treat the parity violating effect as small correction always , since the hubble parameter is smaller than the cut - off scale .    defining new variables @xmath110",
    ", we obtain the canonical action @xmath111 taking the variation of the action with respect to @xmath112 , we obtain the equation for the gravitational waves @xmath113 now , we quantize gravitational waves @xmath114 by using the mode expansion @xmath115 let us represent @xmath96 and @xmath97 in terms of slow - roll parameters as @xmath116 and @xmath117 remember that @xmath118 from the constraint ( [ const1 ] ) . now , using the following relation @xmath119 we obtain the effective potential @xmath120 where we have defined @xmath121 thus , the mode function @xmath122 obeys @xmath123 the bunch - davis vacuum is defined by the asymptotic form of the mode function at @xmath124 @xmath125 using the confluent hypergeometric function @xmath126 , the corresponding positive frequency mode function @xmath127 is analytically given by @xmath128 the asymptotic form of @xmath127 outside the horizon @xmath129 becomes @xmath130 now , let us define the power spectrum @xmath131 as @xmath132",
    "thus , we have the formula @xmath133 for each polarization @xmath134 the total power spectrum @xmath135 becomes @xmath136 it is easy to read off the tensor spectral index @xmath137 as @xmath138 again , this result reduces to the conventional slow - roll formula when @xmath139 .",
    "the most impressive feature of the gauss - bonnet effects in the slow - roll inflation is shown in eq.([nt ] ) . in the usual case , because @xmath140 , @xmath137 takes a negative value , namely , the tensor spectrum is red . however , if we incorporate the effect of the gauss - bonnet term , tensor spectrum could be blue , because @xmath141 takes either positive or negative value .",
    "hence , detection of the blue spectrum in the gravitational waves through the observation of b - mode polarization might indicate the existence of the gauss - bonnet term . in the case of the blue spectrum , @xmath142 , from eq.([hdot ] )",
    ", we see that the background evolution corresponds to superinflation @xmath143 . in this case",
    ", inflaton field could climb up the potential slope , rather than roll down .",
    "this interesting possibility occurs due to the gauss - bonnet induced effective potential .",
    "since we have obtained both the scalar and tensor spectrum , we can deduce the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath144 : @xmath145 since we have the approximate relation @xmath146 , the last factor must be 1 .",
    "hence , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath144 is given by @xmath147 for a negative @xmath141 , we have the minimum , that is , @xmath148 . in the case",
    "@xmath149 , the last term dominates and give rise to the sizable tensor - to - scalar ratio even if @xmath150 is extremely small .",
    "another interesting observable is the circular polarization @xmath151 , which is defined as difference between left and right helicity modes @xmath152 one can see that the circular polarization is small under the constraint ( [ const1 ] ) .",
    "however , it is important to quantify how small it is .",
    "let us consider some extreme case , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , then , the ratio becomes @xmath156 .",
    "this means we have a hope to measure the sub - percent order of polarization due to the parity violating term  @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the effect of the gauss - bonnet term could enhance the amplitude of the primordial gravitational waves .",
    "that also enhances the detectability .",
    "in the previous sections , we have derived general formula for observables in slow - roll inflation with higher curvature corrections . here , we will discuss several models as an illustration .",
    "now , let us consider chaotic inflation models with higher curvature corrections . we take the functions as @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the mass of the inflaton and @xmath159 are parameters of the coupling function @xmath15",
    "then , the slow - roll parameters can be calculated as @xmath160     and tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath144 of the model ( [ example ] ) are shown .",
    "we have also plotted constraints from wmap 5-year result , combined with bao and type i sn .",
    "the contours denote 68% and 95% confidence level .",
    "we used the out - put from cosmological parameters plotter at lambda  @xcite .",

    "blue - colored lines denote the region that generate blue spectrum in tensor modes , and we plot some values of @xmath137 . ]",
    "we can evaluate the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "the results are shown in fig.[ns_r ] . there , we have plotted the scalar spectral index @xmath85 and tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath144 of the model ( [ example ] ) .",
    "we have also plotted constraints from wmap 5-year result , combined with baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) and type i supernova ( sn ) .",
    "it turns out that our simple example explains wmap results better than the conventional slow - roll inflation scenario .",
    "we see these observables are sensitive to higher curvature corrections .",
    "hence , it implies that the higher curvature corrections are relevant to precision cosmology . here",
    ", we notice that there exist parameter regions represented by blue lines which leads to the blue spectrum in tensor modes .",
    "we plotted some typical values of @xmath137 in fig.[ns_r ] .",
    "the e - folding numbers for the blue region can not be estimated , because they correspond to superinflation . in that case , the model ( [ example ] ) must be modified so that the inflation ends .    ,",
    "@xmath164 and @xmath165 . ]    with the higher curvature corrections , there is no consistency relation as in the conventional inflation models .",
    "therefore , in fig.[nt_r ] , we have plotted the @xmath168 diagram .",
    "since we have considered the negative @xmath141 , the minimum of the tensor - to - scalar ratio is zero .",
    "taking look at values for slow - roll parameters , we see the gauss - bonnet term dominates in the region @xmath169 .",
    "we consider @xmath170 model as another example .",
    "we parameterize the potential and the coupling functions as @xmath171 where @xmath172 is a coupling constant .",
    "then , the slow - roll parameters read @xmath173 the scalar spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio for some parameters are shown in fig.[ns_r_phi4 ] .",
    "we see that the @xmath170 model with no higher curvature corrections can not explain observations at all .",
    "however , if we take into account the higher curvature effects , the result changes and the @xmath170 model seems to survive .     and tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath144 of the model ( [ example_2 ] ) are plotted .",
    "the constraints from wmap 5-year data are also shown .",
    "each line corresponds to the parameter ( i ) @xmath174 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 ( ordinary slow - roll ) , ( ii ) @xmath174 , @xmath175 , @xmath176 and ( iii ) @xmath174 , @xmath177 , @xmath176 , from upper to lower . ]",
    "let us give the last example where the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath144 is enhanced due to the gauss - bonnet term . to highlight the feature ,",
    "let us consider the flat potential model @xmath178 where @xmath179 is a constant . for this model ,",
    "the slow - roll parameters are given by @xmath180 it is clear that @xmath144 becomes zero and scalar spectrum becomes completely flat , if the higher curvature corrections are absent .",
    "apparently , the spectral index @xmath181 is not the favored value . moreover",
    ", the detection of the primordial gravitational waves would observationally falsify this model .",
    "however , the higher curvature terms change the situation , since @xmath182 and @xmath183 are not zero !",
    "we show @xmath184 diagram , with correction terms , in fig.[enhance ] . due to the higher curvature terms ,",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath144 becomes detectable and the scalar spectral index @xmath85 is now a preferable value .",
    "this result clearly indicates the importance of higher curvature effects .     and",
    "slow - roll parameters of the model ( [ v_flat ] ) corresponding to scalar spectral index @xmath85 are plotted .",
    "we set parameters as @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath176 . ]",
    "we have studied the slow - roll inflationary scenario with the leading corrections , namely , the gauss - bonnet and the parity violating terms .",
    "we have obtained the higher curvature corrections to the scalar spectral index , the tensor spectral index , and the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "we found that the higher curvature corrections can not be negligible in the dynamics of the scalar field , although they are negligible in the friedmann equation .",
    "it turned out that the tensor - to - scalar ratio could be enhanced because of the modified dynamics of the scalar field .",
    "we have found the tensor spectral index could be blue due to the gauss - bonnet term .",
    "we have also calculated the degree of circular polarization of gravitational waves generated during the slow - roll inflation .",
    "we discussed that the circular polarization can be observable due to the gauss - bonnet and parity violating terms .",
    "we also presented several examples to show observational implications of higher curvature corrections for chaotic inflationary models .",
    "we revealed that the observables are sensitive to the higher curvature corrections .",
    "interestingly , there are some models which shows the slowly climbing up of the potential .",
    "although it is an exotic possibility , the phenomena arises within the slow - roll approximation .",
    "the climbing up inflationary model deserves further investigation .",
    "we can extend the present analysis in various ways .",
    "although we have considered only the scalar field , we could have incorporated the vector field into the system  @xcite , which leads to more general higher derivative corrections .",
    "however , the most important issue is to determine the coupling functions based on the fundamental physics such as the superstring theory .",
    "we leave these issues for future work .",

    "<S> , it turns out that the tensor - to - scalar ratio could be enhanced and the tensor spectral index could be blue due to the gauss - bonnet term . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the degree of circular polarization of gravitational waves generated during the slow - roll inflation . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the circular polarization can be observable with the help both of the gauss - bonnet and parity violating terms . </S>",
    "<S> we also present several examples to reveal observational implications of higher curvature corrections for chaotic inflationary models . </S>"
