    "radio surveys probe active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and star - forming ( sf ) galaxies . sf galaxies produce non - thermal radio continuum through synchrotron emission from supernova remnants . for these sources ,",
    "the 1.4 ghz luminosity is found to be an accurate indicator of the star formation rate @xcite .",
    "agns also emit synchrotron radiation , which is ultimately powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) . observed tight correlations between smbh mass and bulge properties @xcite plus various theoretical considerations",
    "@xcite have led to the hypothesis that agns regulate star formation .",
    "thus , radio surveys are an important tool to constrain how stars and smbhs evolve and interact as a function of cosmic time .",
    "there is still debate over the faint radio population , especially regarding the differential source counts .",
    "agns are found to dominate the counts at high flux densities , while sf galaxies are thought to emerge at lower flux densities @xcite .",
    "however , the exact composition  and the counts themselves  are debated below s@xmath7 @xmath8 100 @xmath4jy .",
    "the disagreement in faint radio counts from one survey to the next has been attributed mostly to instrumental and analysis effects , not to cosmic variance @xcite .",
    "for example , for the heavily studied hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) , three different groups have derived faint - end number counts , with each subsequent study finding them to be incrementally higher @xcite .",
    "however , studies such as @xcite , which present catalogs for three deep radio fields , have shown that similar instrument configurations and analysis methods still result in faint counts that are inconsistent with merely poisson variation .",
    "it is important to obtain as many deep radio images as possible to help resolve this issue , especially since cosmic variance could be an important factor .    in this paper , we present deep radio observations of two heavily - studied cluster fields . radio surveys of cluster fields have been vital to many areas of study . for example , they have improved our understanding of cluster members by finding evidence for a population of dust - obscured sf cluster galaxies that were previously classified as post - starburst galaxies based on optical spectra . with the help of high - resolution near - infrared ( nir ) and optical imaging , @xcite interpreted radio emission from these objects as an indication of ongoing star formation .",
    "radio surveys of cluster fields have also been useful in the study of cluster evolution .",
    "for example , @xcite found that the population of low - luminosity radio sources in clusters rapidly increases with redshift ( 0.02 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath9 0.41 ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as an extension of the butcher - oemler effect @xcite , since the majority of low - luminosity radio sources are found to be blue sf galaxies @xcite .",
    "radio data are key to multiwavelength studies .",
    "radio emission is unobstructed by dust , which avoids a major source of bias found in uv and optical studies . with the addition of far - infrared ( fir )",
    "data , radio data can be used to indicate the dominant emission mechanism .",
    "the radio luminosity is observationally found to be tightly correlated with the fir power for sf galaxies locally @xcite and at high redshift @xcite .",
    "any significant departure from the fir - radio correlation is an indication of agn activity .",
    "in addition , the positional accuracy of radio surveys can be used to pinpoint counterparts at other wavebands . in the submillimeter ,",
    "single dish telescopes have very poor resolution , and the unambiguous identification of counterparts is not possible without additional information . from the fir - radio correlation",
    ", we know that fir luminous sf galaxies , such as submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) , are correspondingly luminous in radio emission . thus , radio data can be used to identify smg counterparts .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite found that @xmath260% of bright ( @xmath112 mjy ) smgs had radio counterparts .",
    "this feature allowed @xcite to use radio positions to target spectroscopically a large sample of bright smgs , establishing the redshift distribution for this population .",
    "bright smgs are predominantly massive , dust - obscured , sf galaxies at a median redshift of @xmath22.2 @xcite .",
    "submillimeter observations are a redshift independent probe ( due to a negative @xmath12-correction : 1 @xmath5 @xmath10 @xmath5 8) of dust - reprocessed uv light .",
    "however , the positive @xmath12-correction of the radio synchrotron emission results in faint observed 1.4 ghz fluxes for high - redshift objects .",
    "thus , a high submillimeter - to - radio flux measurement is an indication of a high - redshift source ( wang et al .  2007 , 2009 ; @xcite ;",

    "this extreme population of very massive sources at very high redshifts has been the topic of intense study and has led many authors to suggest the need for significant modifications to models of galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in the following , we investigate disentangling the cluster galaxy population from the field galaxy population using two techniques .",

    "we lack sufficient spectroscopic data to perform a similar analysis on a2390 .",

    "in other words , we re - derive the number counts within a range of annuli to eliminate the majority of cluster objects . as we reduce the influence of the cluster , we note the effect that has on the number counts .",
    "our large sample of a370 redshifts allows us to re - derive the number counts after excluding known cluster members . to construct the a370 number counts , we used the 529 sources with 37 @xmath5 s@xmath30 @xmath5 3000 @xmath4jy that lie within 16@xmath0 of the field center .",
    "of these , 167 ( 32% ) have known redshifts . in figure 12 , we show the distribution of these redshifts . we define cluster members as any object with @xmath10@xmath310.025 . rather than a physical cluster scale ,",
    "we base the redshift range on a conservative estimate of the redshift error . using this criteria ,",
    "we identify 35 objects as cluster members , and we exclude them from the re - derived counts . in figure 12 , we use positive - slope diagonal lines to denote the cluster members .",
    "we note that our spectroscopic completeness declines as the 1.4 ghz flux decreases and as the projected distance from the cluster center increases . given these biases and the proximity of the cluster members compared to the average field galaxy at @xmath32 @xmath2 1",
    ", we expect to have succeeded in excluding more than 32% of the cluster members .",
    "we show the re - derived number counts in figure 13 as a red dotted line .",
    "we find that the a370 counts are lowered by a weighted average of 5.7%@xmath236.5% .",
    "the estimated error in our weighted average calculation ( 6.5% ) results from propagating the poisson error of our measured counts .",
    "although not corrected for , excluding spectroscopic cluster members will also remove the cluster s effective volume .",
    "this will reduce the survey s effective area and therefore increase the re - derived counts .",
    "this effect is small ( estimated to be on the order of a few percent ) , since the effective volume of our radio field is large when compared to the effective volume of the cluster . given our spectroscopic completeness of 32% , we expect the systematic uncertainty in our estimate of cluster influence to be dominated by any unidentified cluster members . thus , we regard the reported 5.7%@xmath236.5% reduction in our re - derived counts as a lower limit",
    ".      we also re - derive the number counts with cluster center radial masks .",
    "we apply masks to eliminate all galaxies within 2@xmath0 , 4@xmath0 , 6@xmath0 , 8@xmath0 , 10@xmath0 , and 12@xmath0 from the cluster center .",
    "we obtain an estimate of the effectiveness of removing cluster members from both fields using radial masks by considering the cluster evolution study of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m99 ) .",
    "m99 investigated the radial distribution of low - luminosity ( 10@xmath33@xmath5 l@xmath7 @xmath5 10@xmath34 w hz@xmath16 ) radio galaxies ( llrgs ) for a @xmath10 @xmath5 0.25 and a @xmath10 @xmath2 0.4 cluster sample .",
    "the low - redshift sample was composed of 76 cluster llrgs , while the z@xmath20.4 sample was composed of 43 cluster llrgs .    from m99",
    "s derived cumulative radial density profile ( his figure 6.18 ) , we see that a 1.9 mpc ( 6@xmath0 radius ) a370 mask should exclude @xmath282% of the cluster s llrg population , while a 3.7 mpc ( 12@xmath0 radius ) mask should exclude @xmath1197% . the 1.3 mpc ( 6@xmath0 ) and 2.6 mpc ( 12@xmath0 ) a2390 masks should exclude @xmath282% and @xmath297% of the cluster s llrgs , respectively .",
    "llrgs correspond to galaxies with flux densities between 41 - 206 @xmath4jy for the a370 cluster and 129 - 648 @xmath4jy for the a2390 cluster .",
    "the radial distributions of higher luminosity radio sources are found to be more centrally compact .",
    "thus , we expect our masks to reduce significantly the population of all s@xmath35129 @xmath4jy ( @xmath1141 @xmath4jy for a370 ) cluster sources .",
    "there are uncertainties in this estimate , since individual clusters will have deviations from this averaged radial profile .",
    "additionally , the m99 study notes a lack of confirmed outer cluster members in the @xmath29@xmath10 @xmath2 0.4 sample , which may bias this radial profile . as a check on these percentages ,",
    "we note how many spectroscopically confirmed cluster members remain after applying the a370 radial masks .",
    "figure 12 shows the redshift histogram before and after the application of the 6@xmath0 ( histogram filled with negative - slope diagonal lines ) and the 12@xmath0 ( filled histogram ) masks .",
    "our 6@xmath0 and 12@xmath0 cluster masks remove 74% and 97% of the spectroscopically identified cluster members , respectively .",
    "this estimate , while roughly consistent with the m99 result , suffers from our spectroscopic incompleteness , which gets worse with increasing radius and decreasing flux .",
    "we conclude that our 6@xmath0 radial masks should significantly reduce cluster influence on the derived number counts .",
    "we adopt the 12@xmath0 mask result as our best estimate of the total cluster influence .    in figure 13",
    ", we show the number counts after excluding radial areas of 6@xmath0 ( _ dashed _ ) and 12@xmath0 ( _ solid _ ) from the cluster centers .",
    "these angular radii , respectively , correspond to 1.9 and 3.7 mpc at @xmath10@xmath36 = 0.375 and 1.3 and 2.6 mpc at @xmath10@xmath37 = 0.228 .",
    "the a370 field has a 5.0 mpc ( 16@xmath0 ) radial extent , while the a2390 field has a 3.5 mpc ( 16@xmath0 ) radial extent .",

    "if we also exclude any additional spectroscopically identified cluster members not in the masked regions , then these percentages increase by 1% .",
    "excluding radial areas of 6@xmath0 and 12@xmath0 from the a2390 cluster center reduces the number counts by an average of 0.7%@xmath238.8% and 1.1%@xmath2315.1% . in figure 13 , we can see that the re - derived number counts in a2390 are consistently low in the 110 to 350 @xmath4jy range , even when compared to the lowest blank field results .",
    "our best estimate indicates that the a370 cluster influences the derived number counts on the 10@xmath38 level .",
    "the a2390 cluster does not appear to alter significantly the derived number counts .",
    "however , the large poisson error of our measurements weakens this conclusion .",
    "coma is a local ( @xmath10=0.0231 ) cluster of galaxies , while our clusters are at redshifts of @xmath10=0.228 and @xmath10=0.375 . in cluster environments ,",
    "the fraction of llrgs decreases with decreasing redshift ( m99 ) .",
    "thus , evolution effects may be significant and no direct comparison is possible .",
    "however , we may compare our results with the coma cluster counts merely to check for consistency given this known evolution with redshift . specifically , our finding that @xmath10@xmath20.3 cluster llrgs are not a major component in the derived number counts would be at odds with a local measurement showing a significant llrg contribution .    @xcite surveyed two @xmath20.5 deg@xmath39 1.4 ghz vla observations covering the core and southwest region of the coma cluster .",
    "they presented number counts from 0.110 mjy ( their 5@xmath40 limit ) to 100 @xmath29mjy .",
    "their counts have only been corrected for areal coverage .",
    "thus , their faint counts ( @xmath41 0.230 mjy ) should be regarded as lower limits . at the coma cluster",
    "s redshift llrgs would correspond to the flux density range 16 - 82 mjy .",
    "no overdensity is noted in this range .",
    "moreover , they find that their cluster counts are consistent with blank field counts ( we also show this in figure 11 ) .",
    "the only excess of sources is in the @xmath21 - 5 mjy range , and this is not attributed to a cluster effect .",
    "we conclude that our result , indicating that field galaxies make up the vast majority of sources in our cluster fields , is consistent with the local counts found in the coma cluster field .",
    "gravitational lensing affects number counts by boosting observed source flux and by magnifying the source plane .",
    "this lensing bias occurs over a relatively small area compared to our r @xmath8 16@xmath0 fields .",
    "given reasonable estimates for the cluster masses and background source redshifts , we estimate that beyond 2 mpc there is no significant lensing bias .",
    "we believe our estimate of cluster influence does not require any modifications due to lensing considerations .",
    "our results are consistent with the faint number counts being primarily determined by field radio galaxies .",
    "we performed similar reduction and extraction procedures on both cluster fields .",
    "further , the lack of a2390 sources is already seen in the bright radio flux bins , and these should not suffer significantly from incompleteness .",
    "for these reasons , we investigate the significance of cosmic variance .",
    "we estimate the effect of cosmic variance with the method of @xcite . assuming a correlation length of 5 mpc ( consistent with the values given by @xcite for nvss mjy sources ) and a redshift interval of @xmath10 = 1 @xmath23 0.5",
    ", we estimate @xmath212% rms variance due to large - scale structure ( see @xcite for a similar calculation ) .",
    "since there is no clear consensus on the ` true ' faint number counts , we choose to determine if our derived cluster number counts for the two fields can be brought into agreement given reasonable assumptions .",
    "this avoids having to develop some ad hoc method of averaging together faint number counts from radio surveys that have different analysis methods .",
    "an accurate comparison of our derived number counts depends on the accuracy of our derived error bars .",
    "while the estimated error does take into account poisson error and the variance of our monte carlo simulations , it does not account for uncertainties inherent to the completeness simulations .",
    "for example , we determined a simulated object s major axis by randomly sampling from om08 s size distribution .",
    "any inaccuracy in this distribution could alter our derived completeness corrections and thus , our derived number counts .",
    "we adopt 1.5@xmath40 error bars to account for these additional concerns . assuming a 10% reduction in the a370 number counts to account for the cluster s influence , we find that our counts can be brought to within 1 - 2 sigma of each other .",
    "this suggests that cosmic variance can explain the disagreement seen in our derived number counts .",
    "we presented 1.4 ghz catalogs for the cluster fields a370 and a2390 observed with the very large array .",
    "these are two of the deepest radio images of cluster fields ever taken and will be useful for both cluster and field studies .",
    "the a370 image covers an area of 40@xmath0 @xmath1 40@xmath0 with a synthesized beam of @xmath21.7@xmath3 and a noise level of @xmath25.7 @xmath4jy near field center .",
    "the a2390 image covers an area of @xmath234@xmath0 @xmath1 34@xmath0 with a synthesized beam of @xmath21.4@xmath3 and a noise level of @xmath25.6 @xmath4jy near field center .",
    "we cataloged 200 redshifts for the a370 field .",
    "for the region within 16@xmath0 of field center , we derived differential number counts for both fields .",
    "we found that the faint ( 37 @xmath5 s@xmath7 @xmath5 3000 @xmath4jy ) number counts of a370 are roughly consistent with the highest blank field counts , while the faint number counts of a2390 are roughly consistent with the lowest blank field counts .",
    "for the a370 field , we found that cluster members increase our derived number counts by @xmath210% , while the a2390 cluster does not appear to contribute significantly to the presented faint number counts .",
    "we suggest that the disagreement between our faint number counts can be primarily attributed to cosmic variance .",
    "we note that our observed fields , consisting of single pointings with nonuniform sensitivity and contaminated by foreground clusters , are not ideal to resolve definitively the debate over the importance of cosmic variance on faint radio sources .",

    "<S> we catalog 200 redshifts for the abell 370 field . </S>",

    "<S> we find that the faint ( s@xmath6 3 mjy ) counts of abell 370 are roughly consistent with the highest blank field number counts , while the faint number counts of abell 2390 are roughly consistent with the lowest blank field number counts . </S>",
    "<S> our analyses indicate that the number counts are primarily from field radio galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the disagreement of our number counts can be largely attributed to cosmic variance . </S>"
