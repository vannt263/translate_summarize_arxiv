    "tremendous progress has been made over the last decade in extending our knowledge into hitherto unknown regions of the nuclear chart .",
    "the experimental achievements @xcite were accompanied by complementary developments in nuclear theory .",
    "nuclear structure physics has now access to nuclei with a large variety of proton - to - neutron rations , hence allowing to study nuclear forces at extreme isospin .",
    "an equally important new aspect is the strong reduction in separation energies close to the driplines . under such conditions the conventional binding mechanisms known from @xmath3 stable nuclei are likely to cease to be valid .",
    "there are experimental indications - which are strongly supported by theory - that single particle shell structures become dissolved in the vicinity of proton and neutron driplines .",
    "if confirmed this observation will have important consequences because it means that the seemingly well - established prevalence of static mean - field dynamics is being replaced by dynamical processes from nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions . in a very clean way this type of dynamics is observed in halo nuclei while in medium and heavy nuclei",
    "the dominance of the nuclear mean - field seems to survive . but with increasing neutron excess the character of the mean - field is dramatically changed by the strong enhancement of isovector interactions . for very neutron - rich nuclei theory predicts the formation of rather thick layers of almost pure neutron matter representing a genuine state of de - mixed proton and neutron fluids .",
    "descriptions of nuclear interactions and nuclei far off stability necessarily afford strong extrapolations . since data are still scarce the theoretical calculations rely on nuclear models , to be justified ( or falsified ) by experiment .",
    "an approach attempting a self - contained description of stable and unstable nuclei by nuclear many - body theory is presented in the following sections .",
    "an appropriate approach to in - medium nuclear interactions is brueckner theory .",
    "especially the relativistic effects accounted for with dirac - brueckner ( db ) calculations have proven to describe nuclear matter properties rather satisfactorily . in ref.@xcite db hartree - fock ( dbhf ) theory was used to investigate interactions in infinite matter over a large range of asymmetries .",
    "the groningen free - space nn - potential was applied .",
    "effective in - medium meson - nucleon coupling constants were extracted for the isoscalar @xmath4 and @xmath5 and the isovector @xmath6 and @xmath7 mesons , respectively @xcite . in all",
    "meson channels a pronounced dependence on the isoscalar bulk density is found while the dependence on the asymmetry is close to negligible .",
    "hence , to a very good approximation in - medium strong interactions remain intrinsically independent of isospin thus conserving a fundamental symmetry . using the density dependent relativistic hadron ( ddrh ) field theory @xcite the db coupling constants",
    "have been applied to finite nuclei @xcite , hypernuclei @xcite and neutron stars @xcite .",
    "ddrh theory is a microscopic formulation of relativistic mean - field theory @xcite but describing in - medium effects by density dependent coupling constants rather than by non - linear meson self - interactions .",
    "the ddrh calculations describe binding energies , separation energies and other ground state properties of stable and unstable nuclei rather accurately on a level of a few percent @xcite showing that the gross properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei are described very satisfactorily with microscopic interactions .    a clear indication for the incompleteness of a ladder - type interaction model is found in a re - analysis of the ddrh results with a mass - formula showing that especially surface energy contributions are underestimated @xcite .",
    "an important class of interactions not accounted for by db theory are contributions from ring - diagrams which will become important at low densities . also missing are three - body interactions @xcite . in order to account for",
    "the missing contributions we follow the approach of @xcite and introduce a semi - microscopic effective interaction by multiplying the brueckner results by an additional density dependent vertex functional where parameters are fixed in symmetric matter .",
    "results for the equation of state of symmetric and pure neutron matter obtained with ddrh theory are displayed in fig.[fig1 ] and compared to the non - relativistic density dependent d3y parameterization @xcite .",
    "an interesting effect , predicted by many mean - field models , is the appearance of neutron- and proton- skins when the driplines are approached . in fig.[fig1a ] ddrh proton and neutron density distributions for the isotopic chains of @xmath8ni and @xmath9sn nuclides are displayed @xcite . at the proton dripline ( @xmath10ni , @xmath11sn ) proton skins",
    "are found being mainly caused by the coulomb repulsion . with increasing neutron excess neutron skins starts to develop which , for example in the ni - case , reach a thickness of about @xmath12  fm at the neutron dripline , obtained here for @xmath13ni . in skin nuclei",
    "a core of normal composition is coated by a layer of almost pure neutron matter .",
    "investigation of this very particular state of nuclear matter by transfer reactions at rex - isolde energies is discussed in @xcite .    in most of the following calculations for dripline nuclei",
    "non - relativistic hfb and rpa ( or qrpa ) theory will be used .",
    "the main reason for doing so is that at present the extension of ddrh theory ( as is also true for phenomenological rmf models ) to a full dynamical description is still in progress .",
    "relativistic interactions are well tested at the level of hf and hfb theory , i.e. in the limit of a static ground state calculations in the _ no - sea _ approximation .",
    "but only few is known about extensions to dynamical processes , which in a relativistic approach should take into account also the coupling to vacuum modes .",
    "the non - relativistic d3y interaction is based on a parameterization of the g - matrix in terms of boson exchange interactions , including @xmath14 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 exchange .",
    "because of the known inability of non - relativistic brueckner theory to reproduce adequately the empirical nuclear matter eos an additional density dependent re - scaling was introduced in the _ particle - hole ( ph ) _ channel , enforcing agreement with the variational eos of ref.@xcite of for symmetric nuclear matter . using landau - migdal theory @xcite the appropriate ( density dependent ) @xmath15 interactions in the various spin and isospin channels",
    "are derived self - consistently .",
    "the existence of @xmath1li as a particle - stable system relies almost completely on the mutual interactions among the last two valence neutrons . their low separation energy , s@xmath16=320  kev , points to the importance of the mixing with unbound states . for a detailed description of the valence wave function the conventional bcs and hfb methods using representations in terms of mean - field wave functions are not suitable .",
    "theoretically , continuum effects are properly described by solving the gorkov - equations @xcite @xmath17 as coupled equations for the hole and particle components @xcite which are denoted by @xmath18 and are coupled by the pairing field @xmath19 .",
    "the single particle energies are @xmath20 where @xmath21 and e ( @xmath22 ) are the chemical potential and the quasiparticle energy , respectively .",
    "note , that @xmath23 will in general _ not _ coincide with the eigenvalues of the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath24 . in this sense , the states @xmath18 are off the ( mean - field ) energy shell and deviate from usual quasiparticle picture .",
    "a necessary condition for particle - stability is @xmath25 .",
    "then , irrespective of the value of @xmath26 , the hole - type solutions @xmath27 are exponentially decaying for @xmath28 . for e@xmath29 , an exponential asymptotic behaviour",
    "is also found for the particle - type components @xmath30 and a discrete subset of eigenvalues @xmath26 is obtained . for e@xmath31 , eq.([gorkov ] ) has to be solved with continuum wave boundary conditions for @xmath32 leading to single particle spectral functions being distributed continuously in energy .",
    "hence the quasi - particle picture , underlying bcs theory and , to some degree , also discretized hfb theory , is extended to a fully dynamical continuum description .    here",
    ", we consider only like - particle @xmath33 pairing . writing for protons ( @xmath34 ) and neutrons ( @xmath35 ) @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , where the reduced wave functions @xmath38 and @xmath39 are normalized to unity and @xmath40 correspond to bcs amplitudes , the pairing fields",
    "are then defined in terms of the anomal or pairing density matrices for protons and neutrons , respectively , @xmath41 and the proton and neutron pairing fields are @xmath42 if @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are guaranteed to decay exponentially for @xmath28 . the pairing interaction in the @xmath46 channel",
    "is described by @xmath47 .",
    "it is still an open question whether the free space or an in - medium singlet - even interaction should be used ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    here , for the numerical calculations a local momentum approximation",
    "is introduced by averaging in momentum space over the non - locality and replacing @xmath48 .",
    "this corresponds to including the off - shell correlations into the strength factor @xmath49 which , as a consequence , acquires an intrinsic density dependence .",
    "it is given by the in - medium on - shell @xmath50 scattering amplitude at the local on - shell momentum @xmath51 , i.e. the ( two - body ) s - wave component of the @xmath50 brueckner g - matrix in the @xmath46 channel . the density dependence is re - adjusted such that for @xmath52 the free space @xmath50 s - wave phase shifts are reproduced .",
    "a comparison to the bonn - b phase shifts @xcite is shown in fig.[fig2 ] .    in order to understand pairing in weakly bound nuclei in more detail",
    "it is instructive to extract from eq.([gorkov ] ) ( non - local and energy - dependent ) dynamical pairing self - energies in the particle and hole channel , respectively , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mean - field single particle propagator in the complementary ( hole or particle ) channel .",
    "this leads to the equivalent set of ( formally ) decoupled integro - differential equations @xmath55 showing that the generalized pairing approach may depart strongly from a conventional bcs description , especially when @xmath56 becomes comparable in magnitude to the effective single particle energies @xmath23 . in the constant - gap bcs approximation @xmath57",
    "the self - energies become @xmath58 and eq.([decouple ] ) reduces to the conventional bcs eigenvalue problem .    returning to the full problem",
    ", strength functions for @xmath1li are displayed in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the strong deviation from a pure mean - field or bcs description is apparent by observing that besides the expected s- and p - wave components also @xmath59 strength is lowered into the bound state region .",
    "remarkably , the mean - field does not support neither bound @xmath60 nor @xmath61 single particle levels and their appearance is solely due to pairing .",
    "the states acquire a finite width because of the coupling to the particle continuum .",
    "theoretically , the proton ( @xmath34 ) and neutron ( @xmath35 ) densities in a systems like @xmath1li are defined by @xmath62 from which the particle numbers @xmath63 are found .",
    "the neutron partial wave occupation numbers @xmath64 are included in fig.[fig3 ] . in stable nuclei discrete levels at @xmath65 will contribute to eq.([density ] ) . in extreme dripline nuclei",
    "they are missing because of the smallness of @xmath66 . in fig.[fig4 ] the proton and neutron ground state densities are shown , multiplied by @xmath67 in order to emphasize the differences in shape and the neutron halo component .",
    "applications of the densities in high - energy elastic scattering of @xmath1li on a proton target are discussed in @xcite .",
    "measured @xmath1li response functions were analyzed by qrpa calculations in @xcite .    rather than solving the full continuum pairing problem as discussed here",
    "a widely used approach is to represent the gorkov spectrum by a set of discretized energy levels by imposing a box boundary condition on the solutions of eq.([gorkov ] ) @xcite .",
    "a comparison shows a good agreement between the full and the discretized calculations for binding energies , chemical potentials and ground state densities provided the box radius is chosen large enough ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "dynamical core polarization is seen most clearly in nuclei with a single nucleon outside a core . approaching the driplines the core nucleus by itself is already far off stability containing weakly bound single particle orbits . under these circumstances the surface tension and therefore the restoring forces against external perturbations",
    "are reduced .",
    "such `` soft core '' systems are , for example , found in the neutron - rich even - mass carbon isotopes .",
    "a good indicator is the existence of low - energy 2@xmath69 states , decreasing in energy with increasing mass .",
    "continuum qrpa calculations with a residual interaction derived in landau - fermi liquid theory from the d3y in - medium interaction reproduce the systematics of 2@xmath69 states rather well .",
    "this leads to the conclusion that they are mainly of vibrational nature rather than due to static deformation as assumed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "the calculations predict a strong increase of the quadrupole polarizibilities in the carbon isotopes for increasing neutron excess with a maximum around @xmath70c .",
    "this behaviour is due to the lowering of the first 2@xmath69 state which in @xmath71c is located at @xmath72  mev and moves down to @xmath73  mev in @xmath74c .",
    "the dipole ( or eletric ) polarizibility , however , changes only within 10% over the @xmath75c isotopic chain .    in a system with core polarization the valence particle ( or hole ) obeys a non - static wave equation @xmath76 including the static ( hfb ) mean - field hamiltonian @xmath77 and the non - local and energy - dependent polarization self - energy @xmath78 describing the rescattering of the nucleon off the core thereby exciting it into states of various multipolarities and excitation energies followed by subsequent de - excitations back to the ground state ( see fig.[fig5 ] ) .    during these processes",
    "the particle can be scattered virtually into high lying orbitals .",
    "the quantum numbers of the intermediate @xmath79 ( or @xmath80 ) configurations are only constraint by the requirement that spin and parity much match those of the leading particle configuration , given by the state moving with respect to the inert core in its ground state . in nuclear matter and finite nuclei",
    "these processes are known to give rise to a depletion of momentum space ground state occupation probabilities @xcite from the step function momentum distribution of a fermi gas of quasiparticles interacting only by a static mean - field . in practice ,",
    "the core excitations are calculated in qrpa theory thus extending the static hfb picture in a consistent way to a dynamical theory .    in a finite nucleus",
    "the dynamical single particle self - energies @xmath78 affect separation energies and wave functions . in dripline",
    "nuclei the polarization self - energies are found to have a pronounced state - dependence . in fig.[fig6 ] dcp self - energies for the lowest @xmath81 and @xmath82 in @xmath2c are shown . in the @xmath82 channel the overall strength is small and a fluctuating shape is obtained .",
    "the @xmath81 states , however , experience an additional attraction from an attractive surface - type self - energy which , in fact , provides the main source of binding for @xmath2c@xmath83 .",
    "theoretically , this amounts to use a multi - configuration ground state containing a single particle component - reminiscent of the static mean - field configuration - and a multitude of configurations where the valence particle is rescattered into other orbits by interactions with the core @xcite .",
    "coupling to the lowest 2@xmath69 and 3@xmath84 states only as advocated e.g. in @xcite can not account for the complexity of the process .",
