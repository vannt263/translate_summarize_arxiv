    "atomistic computer simulations have become an important complement to experimental measurements in studies of a wide variety of physical , chemical and biological systems .",
    "however , in order to reduce computational effort that is required for larger systems , a number of approximations are typically made in these simulations .",
    "one that is commonly employed is to assume that the atomic nuclei behave as classical particles , even when the interactions between them are obtained from an _ ab initio _ calculation .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption for heavy atoms at high temperatures .",
    "but for lighter atoms  and hydrogen in particular  significant deviations are to be expected from classical behavior even at room temperature .    when empirical interaction potentials are used to compute the forces acting on the nuclei , nuclear quantum effects are often implicitly accounted for , because force fields are typically parameterised so as to agree with experimental data when used in classical molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "ab initio _ methods are used to describe the interactions between the nuclei , there is no such parameterisation for nuclear quantum effects , and the error that results from assuming purely classical behavior of the nuclear motion is often comparable to that stemming from an approximate treatment of electron correlation.@xcite    the conventional approach to including nuclear quantum effects exploits the isomorphism between the quantum mechanical partition function of the physical system and the classical partition function of an extended problem consisting of a necklace ( or ring polymer ) of replicas of the system in which corresponding atoms are connected by harmonic springs.@xcite as the number of replicas ( or beads of the necklace ) is increased , this imaginary time path integral@xcite ( pi ) method samples an ensemble that converges systematically to that of the quantum problem with distinguishable particles , at the expense of a computational effort that increases in proportion to the number of beads .",
    "methods have been devised to reduce this effort by splitting the calculation of forces into an inexpensive , short - ranged contribution that is computed on every bead , and a long - range contribution that is evaluated on a contracted ring polymer with fewer beads.@xcite these methods are straightforward to implement in simulations with empirical force fields .",
    "however they can not presently be used in _ ab initio _",
    "simulations , where the splitting of the forces into an inexpensive short - range contribution plus a more expensive long - range contribution is significantly more difficult to arrange .",
    "approximate quantum methods such as the feynman - hibbs@xcite approach are also difficult to use in _ ab initio _ simulations , because they require the computation of the hessian .    a more general approach to reducing the effort of path integral simulations",
    "is therefore called for , and there are certain indications in the literature that this might now be possible . in particular , it has recently been shown that colored noise , generalized langevin equation ( gle ) thermostats can be used not only to enhance the sampling of classical and path integral molecular dynamics,@xcite but also to modify conventional molecular dynamics so as to include nuclear quantum effects in mildly anharmonic systems in which zero - point energy plays a significant role.@xcite this approach involves negligible overhead with respect to purely classical dynamics , provides very naturally the proton momentum distribution ( which is relevant for comparison with inelastic neutron scattering experiments ) , and can be applied with the same ease to empirical and _ ab initio _ force fields . however , it does not provide a satisfactory description of more subtle quantum effects such as tunnelling , and its accuracy can not be systematically improved .    in this paper , we will show that it is possible to combine a gle thermostat with path integral molecular dynamics ( pimd ) in such a way as to exploit the best features of both techniques .",
    "in particular , by tuning the properties of the correlated noise in an appropriate gle , we will show that the systematic convergence of pimd to the exact quantum mechanical result can be greatly accelerated , leading to significant computational savings for a given level of accuracy .",
    "the resulting pi+gle scheme provides an equally reliable description of zero point energy and tunnelling effects , it is equally applicable to simulations with empirical and _ ab initio _ force fields , and unlike the original single - bead `` quantum thermostat '' discussed above it can be systematically improved simply by increasing the number of path integral beads .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly recall a few concepts from path integral and generalized langevin equation methods , and describe our strategy to have them work in synergy . in section  iii we present a systematic study of a one - dimensional quartic double well potential , discussing the effect of zero point energy and tunnelling on the convergence of our method .",
    "in section  iv we examine how the method performs for liquid water , and in section  v we draw our conclusions .",
    "let us first recall the basic principles of imaginary time path integral methods , so as to introduce our notation . we will only discuss the one - dimensional case and refer the reader to the literature@xcite for a more detailed discussion .",

    "the error in this approximation is @xmath11 and so vanishes to leave the exact quantum mechanical result in the limit as @xmath12.@xcite    the momenta are often integrated out of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi - z ] ) to leave a purely configurational integral which forms the basis of the path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) technique.@xcite one can however retain the momenta , and describe the dynamical evolution of the ring polymer by means of hamilton s equations .",
    "this is the pimd approach,@xcite which provides a particularly efficient way to sample the configuration space in situations such as molecular liquid simulations in which an effective pimc calculation would require complicated collective moves .",
    "a fully converged pimd calculation produces the exact thermodynamic and structural properties of the quantum mechanical system .",
    "although it is something of an aside to the present work , in which we shall be concerned exclusively with static equilibrium properties , it is also now well established that the centroid molecular dynamics@xcite and ring polymer molecular dynamics@xcite generalizations of pimd can be used to provide quite reasonable estimates of dynamical properties such as diffusion coefficients and chemical reaction rates .",
    "the extension to three dimensions and to an arbitrary number of interacting distinguishable particles is straightforward . but rather than describe this extension here ,",
    "let us consider instead the simple case of a one - dimensional harmonic potential , @xmath13 .",
    "the result will be used in what follows . for this simple model , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi - z ] ) can be evaluated by transforming to the @xmath7 normal modes @xmath14 of the ring polymer with frequencies @xmath15 it is then easy to show that the equilibrium position distribution of each bead of the ring polymer will be a gaussian centred on @xmath16 , with a variance @xmath17 which converges to the correct quantum mechanical thermal expectation value @xmath18 in the limit as @xmath12 .",
    "it has recently been shown that an appropriate generalized langevin equation ( gle ) thermostat can be used to sample configurations for a harmonic oscillator that are consistent with the quantum mechanical variance in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi - q2 ] ) using just a single replica of the system , thereby avoiding the overhead of a @xmath7-bead pi simulation.@xcite    the basic idea behind gle thermostats is to construct a linear , markovian stochastic differential equation ( sde ) in an extended _ momentum _ space which is coupled to the hamiltonian dynamics in such a way that the equations of motion read @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a vector of @xmath21 uncorrelated gaussian random numbers with @xmath22 .",
    "it can be shown that the resulting trajectories are statistically equivalent to those obtained from a non - markovian langevin equation involving only @xmath23 and @xmath24,@xcite @xmath25 where the friction kernel @xmath26 and the noise correlation function @xmath27 are related by analytical expressions to the matrices that appear in eq .",

    "( [ eq : mark - sde ] ) is the force @xmath28 .",
    "if the potential is harmonic , the force depends linearly on @xmath24 , and the whole set of equations describe an ornstein - uhlenbeck process,@xcite which can be solved analytically to yield closed - form expressions for static and dynamic properties of the trajectory . based on these expressions",
    ", one can iteratively refine the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mark - sde ] ) subject to certain positivity constraints until the desired response of the thermostat is obtained.@xcite    when considering the generalisation of this strategy to a multi - dimensional harmonic problem , one realises that , because of the linear nature of the sde and of the consequent rotational invariance , the dynamics will conform to the analytical predictions obtained from the ornstein - uhlenbeck process even if the thermostats are applied to cartesian coordinates , without the need to diagonalise the hessian and transform to normal modes .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated in previous work that the analytical properties of the thermostat obtained in the harmonic limit provide a meaningful prediction of its behavior for anharmonic problems with a similar range of frequencies.@xcite    by employing this strategy it is possible to obtain a number of useful effects , such as efficient sampling of the canonical distribution in constant - temperature md . in this application ,",
    "a fluctuation - dissipation theorem must hold , which relates the friction kernel and the memory of the noise in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonmark - sde ] ) through @xmath37 . more generally , when this condition is not imposed , one obtains a non - equilibrium dynamics in which a frequency - dependent effective temperature is enforced .",
    "either way , one can calculate the stationary covariance of the harmonic dynamics in the @xmath38 extended phase space , and the mean squared fluctuations of the positions and momenta , which we will label @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "it is then possible to design a gle dynamics which behaves as a `` quantum thermostat'';@xcite i.e. , which enforces probability distributions of positions and momenta that are consistent with those expected for a quantum harmonic oscillator , @xmath41 and does so over a wide range of frequencies .",
    "when applying this idea to a multi - dimensional system one faces the problem of zero - point energy leakage.@xcite anharmonic coupling causes a flow of heat from high - frequency to low - frequency vibrations , and a departure from the desired behavior in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cppcqq ] ) .",
    "this problem can be mitigated to some extent by exploiting the flexibility of the gle in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mark - sde ] ) to enhance the coupling strength of the thermostat and ensure that all vibrations are maintained at the correct effective temperature .",
    "this approach has been shown to give satisfactory results in a number of realistic , condensed - matter applications , ranging from the calculation of diamond - graphite coexistence curves@xcite to the proton momentum distribution in hydrogen - storage materials.@xcite    being simple to implement and computationally inexpensive , this  quantum thermostat \" is an important step towards a routine treatment of nuclear quantum effects in molecular dynamics .",
    "it lacks however two desirable features ; namely , the possibility of treating more subtle quantum effects such as tunnelling , and the possibility of increasing the accuracy in a systematic way . since both these requirements",
    "are met by pi methods , one suspects that it might be possible to develop a synergistic approach which combines path integrals with the gle thermostat so as to obtain accurate results without the effort of a fully - converged pi simulation . the implementation of such a pi+gle approach is the subject of the next section .      when a gle thermostat is applied to a path integral molecular dynamics simulation , the internal frequencies of the ring polymer necklace will be present along with the physical vibrations of the system .",
    "it is therefore once again instructive to consider a harmonic model with frequency @xmath42 , for which both the ring polymer frequencies and the stochastic dynamics can be treated analytically .    in order to construct a non - equilibrium langevin dynamics that enforces the quantum mechanical equilibrium distribution corresponding to the frequency - dependent fluctuations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cppcqq ] ) , one must allow in the path integral context for the fact that the average of @xmath43 is obtained from a sum over the ring polymer normal modes , @xmath44 where the normal mode frequencies @xmath45 are given in eq .",

    "the last equality holds if a gle which results in the frequency - dependent position fluctuation @xmath39 has been applied separately to each bead of the ring polymer .",
    "it follows from this that one can not simply tune the parameters in the gle acting on each bead of the necklace so that @xmath39 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cppcqq ] ) .",
    "instead , the appropriate frequency - dependent distribution to be enforced depends on the number of beads in the necklace , and can be obtained by solving @xmath46 the first task is therefore to solve this functional equation for @xmath39 , recalling again that the frequencies @xmath45 are related to the frequency @xmath42 of the harmonic oscillator by eq .",

    "it is less essential to enforce strong coupling to avoid zero point energy leakage , and it is therefore possible to avoid the overdamping which hinders the sampling in the case of the original quantum thermostat .",

    "the design of a gle consistent with @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cqq - pigle ] ) consists of optimising the matrices in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mark - sde ] ) until the desired response of the thermostat is obtained .",
    "as has been found for a variety of other applications of the gle,@xcite the efficacy of the resulting pi+gle scheme will depend on the strategy by which the optimisation is performed , and on the additional criteria besides fitting @xmath39 that are used to define the merit function for the optimisation . for applications of the quantum thermostat to anharmonic problems",
    "the strength of the coupling between the thermostat and the hamiltonian dynamics and the efficiency of the sampling can be just as important as the agreement between @xmath39 and the target function in eq .  (",
    "the possibility of improving the accuracy systematically by increasing the number of beads makes zero - point energy leakage and other anharmonic effects a lesser concern in the present context .",
    "however , if systematic convergence is to be achieved , it is advisable that the sampling efficiency does not differ dramatically between the fits for different numbers of beads .    in the case of the original quantum thermostat described in ref .",
    "@xcite , we chose to constrain @xmath71 as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cppcqq ] ) .",
    "this had the advantage of providing ready access to the quantum mechanical momentum distribution , which is a quantity of direct relevance to recent deep inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "however , by constraining @xmath40 in this way , we found that we had to enforce a strongly overdamped regime at low frequencies in order to avoid zero point energy leakage in applications to multi - dimensional systems.@xcite in the present pi+gle scheme , as in pimd itself , the ring polymer momenta lose all physical significance as soon as there is more than one bead , and extracting the quantum mechanical momentum distribution requires a considerably more intricate calculation.@xcite when it comes to fitting the gle , it is therefore more natural to regard the momenta simply as a sampling device , and to focus exclusively on the fluctuations of configurations @xmath39 , as we have already done in our description of pi+gle in sec .  iii.c .",
    "as shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "this leaves significantly more freedom in the fit , even in the case of just one bead .",
    "the extra freedom allows us to reproduce the desired @xmath39 with a maximum discrepancy smaller than @xmath72% and to achieve high sampling efficiency over a broad range of frequencies , yielding a sampling performance comparable to that of an `` optimal sampling '' gle.@xcite to give another example involving more beads , the self - diffusion coefficient for a model of liquid water ( see sec .",
    "iv ) - which in this context can only be regarded as a measure of the sampling efficiency for slow , collective motion - is reduced by less than 50% in a well - converged ( 8 bead ) pi+gle simulation compared to nve dynamics , whereas the original ( one bead ) quantum thermostat decreases the diffusion coefficient of the same model by a factor of 10 .",
    "having obtained a nearly - constant sampling efficiency is also beneficial to the transferability of the fitted parameters , as discussed in refs.@xcite . as a matter of fact , the very same parameterization has been adopted for both of the examples given below , which are as different as a one - dimensional quartic double well and liquid water . with an appropriate scaling,@xcite",
    "these gle parameters can be safely adopted in all circumstances where the maximum physical frequency present in the system is smaller than @xmath73 .",
    "the gle parameters we have used in the present study are available up to @xmath74 and may be downloaded from an online repository@xcite .",
    "the details of how we actually optimised the gle matrices for the present pi+gle application are rather technical , and less important than the criteria employed for the optimisation that we have just described .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of the optimisation of gle matrices has recently been given elsewhere,@xcite and we used exactly the same techniques in the present study .",
    "the implementation of a gle thermostat into a pimd code has also been discussed in detail in a recent paper,@xcite where it was shown to be essentially no more complicated than adding a thermostat to a classical molecular dynamics simulation . however , in the case of pi+gle there are a few additional points that we do need to make .",
    "first of all , the dynamics in pi+gle _ must _ be performed using physical bead masses , as opposed to the alternative masses that are sometimes used in path integral schemes .",
    "unless physical bead masses are used the frequencies of the necklace will be different from those in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omegak ] ) , and eq .  ( [ eq : xk ] ) will have to be modified accordingly ; this will change the functional equation for @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h - equation ] ) and the new equation will have to be solved from scratch .",
    "the equations of motion can be integrated efficiently with physical bead masses by performing a normal mode transformation for the free ring polymer evolution@xcite and/or employing a multiple time step scheme.@xcite    another important observation is that , at variance with canonical sampling gle schemes in which the free particle propagation of the gle preserves the equilibrium distribution , the stationary probability distribution of the pi+gle scheme requires an accurate integration of the stochastic differential equations of motion on the timescale of the fastest modes .",
    "for this reason , whenever a multiple time step integrator is used , the thermostat should be applied in the inner loop . as a consequence ,",
    "the integration of the gle introduces a sizeable computational overhead , which can be significant in cases when the calculation of physical forces is inexpensive . in the case of _",
    "ab initio _ molecular dynamics , which is the primary target for the present method , the overhead will be completely negligible .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , one of the fundamental shortcomings of the original quantum thermostat@xcite is its inability to provide a realistic description of tunnelling effects .",

    "a very small time step was needed because we integrated the pi equations of motion directly using the velocity verlet method , without exploiting the exact free ring polymer evolution that becomes possible in the normal mode representation.@xcite for each set of parameters we ran pimd and pi - gle trajectories for @xmath90  ns .",
    "it is clear from fig .  4 that the pi - gle simulations yield a significantly better estimate of the finite - temperature density of the quartic double well than the pimd simulations , even in the regime of small @xmath77 and large @xmath76 where tunnelling plays an important role .",

    "comprehensive results for the convergence of structural properties of water are reported in fig .  7 , in which we systematically examine the radial distribution functions that are obtained with different bead numbers .",
    "here again the gle helps tremendously in accelerating the convergence of the pi calculation , in particular in the region of the intramolecular peaks , which are strongly affected by nuclear quantum effects . the only case in which the pi+gle simulation is in worse agreement agreement with the exact result than the pimd simulation is when the oxygen - oxygen @xmath103 is computed with too few beads ( @xmath84 and @xmath104 ) .",

    ", one sees that pi+gle provides the same accuracy in the thermodynamic and structural properties of liquid water with 8 beads as pimd provides with 32 beads .",
    "this is the level of accuracy that is commonly accepted for room - temperature water simulations , and adding an appropriate gle to the pi simulation allows it to be achieved with a four - fold reduction in the number of beads .",
    "the comparison becomes even more favourable if higher accuracy is required , with a 16-bead pi+gle simulation being as accurate as a 128-bead pimd simulation for all of the observables we have considered .",
    "in the present paper we have discussed and thoroughly demonstrated how a properly - designed generalized langevin equation can be used to accelerate the convergence of path integral molecular dynamics to the exact quantum mechanical thermal expectation values .",
    "this leads to substantial savings in computational effort , the number of beads required to obtain a given level of accuracy being reduced by a factor of 4 or more .",
    "the original ( one - bead ) quantum thermostat@xcite provides an even cheaper way to include nuclear quantum effects in mildly anharmonic systems , but it is an inherently approximate technique .",
    "the present pi+gle combination captures tunnelling effects as well as zero point energy effects , and it can be systematically improved to give the exact quantum mechanical result simply by increasing the number of path integral beads .",
    "we expect that this combination will be particularly valuable when used in conjunction with _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics , in which the forces acting on the nuclei are so expensive to evaluate that nuclear quantum effects have only seldom been considered in the past .",
    "one final observation is that we have concentrated exclusively in this paper on the standard second order trotter product path integral in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pi - z ] ) and ( [ eq : ham - p ] ) .",
    "another way to reduce the number of path integral beads is to use a higher - order imaginary time propagator , and some interesting progress has been made in this direction over the years.@xcite this approach is fundamentally different from the approach we have investigated here , and potentially complementary to it .",
    "one could in principle develop a gle scheme to accelerate the convergence of any imaginary time propagator , including the more promising of the higher - order propagators that have been suggested in the literature . in this way",
    ", one might hope to be able to reduce the number of beads even further , and make the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects in _ ab initio _",
    "simulations almost routine . in any event",
    ", the results we have presented in this paper clearly demonstrate the potential of the generalized langevin equation as a computational tool for accelerating the convergence of pimd .",
