    "a detailed picture of the present day galaxy populations , their evolution and emission properties across different wavelengths is still far from complete . surveys like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) have collected large amounts of information in the optical regime , while 2mass ( @xcite ) and the iras mission ( @xcite ) have provided valuable , albeit relatively shallow , data sets from @xmath10 band up to 100  @xmath0 m .",
    "more recently , the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ; @xcite ) has completed mapping the whole sky in the mid and far infrared , at sensitivities much deeper than any other large - scale infrared survey . for example , wise is about 100 times more sensitive at 12@xmath0 m than iras .",
    "while our understanding of the optical and far - ir properties of galaxies ( long - ward of 24@xmath0 m ) has grown steadily , thanks mainly to spitzer and herschel , the spectral region between 10 - 15  @xmath0 m remains comparatively unexplored . in normal galaxies , the light at the redder optical bands and in the @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 near - ir bands is closely tied to the total mass of the galaxy , as it is dominated by the red population of older stars . at wavelengths",
    "longer than @xmath48  @xmath0 m , emission from dust heated by younger stars becomes increasingly relevant and begins to trace the star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "the rate at which galaxies transform gas into stars is one of the most fundamental diagnostics that describes the evolution of galaxies . of major importance",
    "is to find what physical parameter(s ) drive changes in the sfr . as dust - reprocessed light from young stars",
    "is re - emitted mainly in the far - infrared ( fir ) regime , the fir luminosity is one of the best tracers of star formation activity ( @xcite ) . it is well known that commonly used sfr indicators , such as the uv continuum and nebular emission line fluxes , require sometimes substantial corrections for dust extinction . furthermore ,",
    "these corrections are highly uncertain and difficult to derive . for this reason , integrated estimators based on the total infrared ( ir ) luminosity , either alone or in combination with the ultraviolet luminosity ( e.g. @xcite ) , and monochromatic estimators based mainly on 24  @xmath0 m fluxes , alone or in combination with h@xmath13 luminosity ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , are increasingly being considered as reliable star formation indicators for normal and dusty star - forming galaxies .",
    "the use of any ir flux as a sfr indicator relies on the assumption that the ir continuum emission is due to warm dust grains heated by young stars .",
    "however there is also a contribution to dust reprocessed emission by old stellar populations , associated more with the interstellar medium around evolved stars than to recently born stars .",
    "in addition , some fraction of the ir luminosity may be attributed to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , if present ( in section  [ sec : agn_effect ] we find agn emission is of minor importance in most of our sample ) .",
    "the exact contribution of each component is difficult to estimate without detailed spectral analysis .",
    "@xcite and @xcite found correlations between the 12@xmath0 m luminosity and the total ir luminosity for small samples of nearby galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that sources in abell 1689 with high iso mid - ir color index [ 15  @xmath0m]/[6.75  @xmath0 m ] are mostly blue , actively star forming galaxies , while low mid - ir flux ratios correspond to passive early - type systems .",
    "they suggest that 15  @xmath0 m emission is a reliable indicator of obscured star formation .",
    "similarly , shorter wavelength mid - ir emission such as wise 12@xmath0 m is expected to be a practical tracer of star formation activity .",
    "an important caveat is that far - infrared and/or radio measurements are only available for a small fraction of known galaxies .",
    "early work by @xcite using iras all - sky data used 12@xmath0 m to select unbiased samples of active galaxies with fluxes above 220  mjy and to study their luminosity function .",
    "deep pencil - beam surveys have complemented these samples with high redshift data .",
    "@xcite conducted a 12@xmath0 m survey of the eso - sculptor field ( 700  arcmin@xmath14 ) with the iso satellite down to 0.24 mjy .",
    "@xcite used it to model mid - ir galaxy counts , revealing a population of dusty , massive ellipticals in ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) .",
    "@xcite performed imaging of the goods fields ( 150  arcmin@xmath14 ) at 16  @xmath0 m with the spitzer spectrometer , finding that @xmath415% of objects are potentially agn at their depth of 40 - 65  @xmath0jy .",
    "these surveys illustrate the necessary tradeoff between depth and area covered , potentially limiting the statistical significance of results due to cosmic variance .",
    "wise provides the data to significantly improve the situation .",
    "our sample of @xmath410@xmath15 galaxies ( see below ) is over 200 times more sensitive than iras - based surveys and covers an area @xmath4370 times larger than the goods samples .    in this work",
    "we explore the physical properties of 12@xmath0m - selected galaxies in the local universe , using a large sample of star forming galaxies and agn with available redshifts and emission line measurements from the sdss .",
    "this is by far the largest 12@xmath0 m sample to date , and we use it to trace the origin of ir emission across different galaxy populations and to investigate how ir emission relates to stellar mass . we also explore using 12@xmath0 m luminosity as a proxy for sfr to distinguish intense starburst activity from quiescent star formation .",
    "since we employ the sdss spectroscopic catalog , our results apply to relatively bright galaxies at low redshift .",
    "wise certainly recovers other populations of galaxies , ranging from low metallicity blue compact dwarf galaxies at very low redshift ( @xcite ) to highly obscured sources at high redshift ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite shows that wise detects @xmath16 galaxies out to @xmath17 in the 3.4@xmath0 m band , while @xcite shows that wise is a very capable agn finder , sensitive to both obscured and unobscured qsos .",
    "a companion paper by @xcite analyzes more diverse galaxy populations observed by wise and sdss ( including deeper photometric sdss objects ) , while here we focus on 12@xmath0m - selected sources with available spectra .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe the surveys used in this work as well as explain the construction of our joint wise - sdss sample . in section 3",
    "we characterize the galaxy populations and present the results on the analysis of the mid - ir emission and sfr .",
    "finally , section 4 summarizes our results and discusses the implications of this work .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume a flat @xmath18cdm cosmology , with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we adopt @xmath21=70  km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 .",
    "wise has mapped the full sky in four bands centered at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 and 22  @xmath0 m , achieving 5@xmath22 point source sensitivities better than 0.08 , 0.11 , 1 and 6  mjy , respectively .",
    "every part of the sky has been observed typically around 10 times , except near the ecliptic poles where the coverage is much higher .",
    "astrometric precision is better than 0.15@xmath23 for high s / n sources ( @xcite ) and the angular resolution is 6.1 , 6.4 , 6.5 and 12@xmath23 for bands ranging from 3  @xmath0 m to 22  @xmath0 m .",
    "this paper is based on data from the wise preliminary release 1 ( april 2011 ) , which comprises an image atlas and a catalog of over 257 million sources from 57% of the sky .",
    "an object is included in this catalog if it : ( 1 ) is detected with snr@xmath247 in at least one of the four bands , ( 2 ) is detected on at least five independent single - exposure images in at least one band , ( 3 ) has snr@xmath243 in at least 40% of its single - exposure images in one or more bands , ( 4 ) is not flagged as a spurious artifact in at least one band .",
    "we refer the reader to the wise preliminary release explanatory supplement for further details ( @xcite ) .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) is a five - band photometric ( @xmath25 bands ) and spectroscopic survey that has mapped a quarter of the sky , providing photometry , spectra and redshifts for about a million galaxies and quasars .",
    "the mpa - jhu catalog ( @xcite , hereafter b04 ) is a value - added catalog based on data from the seventh data release ( dr7 , @xcite ) of the sdss .",
    "it consists of almost @xmath26 galaxies with spectra reprocessed by the mpa - jhu team , for which physical properties based on detailed emission line analysis are readily available . here",
    "we give a brief description of the catalog and the methodology employed to estimate sfrs .",
    "we refer the reader to the original papers for an in - depth discussion .",
    "the mpa - jhu catalog classifies galaxies according to their emission lines , given the position they occupy in the bpt ( @xcite ) diagram that plots the [ oiii ]  @xmath275007 / h@xmath28 versus [ nii ]  @xmath276584 / h@xmath13 flux ratios .",
    "this separates galaxies with different ionizing sources as they populate separate sequences on the bpt diagram . in most galaxies ,",
    "normal star formation can account for the flux ratios .",
    "however , in some cases an extra source such as an agn is required . in this paper",
    "we follow this bpt classification to distinguish between : * ( i ) star - forming galaxies * ( class sf and low s / n sf from b04 ) , * ( ii ) active galactic nuclei * ( class agn and low s / n liner from b04 ) , and * ( iii ) composite systems * that present signatures of the two previous types ( class c from b04 ) .",
    "note that broad - lined agn like quasars and seyfert 1 galaxies are are not included in the sample , as they were targeted by different criteria by the sdss .",
    "star formation rates are derived by different prescriptions depending on the galaxy type . the methodology adopted by b04",
    "is based on modeling emission lines using @xcite models along with the cloudy photoionization model ( @xcite ) and spectral evolution models from @xcite to subtract the stellar continuum . to correct lines for dust attenuation",
    ", mpa - jhu adopts the multicomponent dust model of @xcite , where discrete dust clouds are assumed to have finite lifetime and a realistic spatial distribution .",
    "this approach produces sfrs that take full advantage of all modeled emission lines . for agn and composite galaxies in the sample",
    ", sfrs were estimated by the relationship between the d@xmath29 spectral index and the specific sfr ( sfr / m@xmath30 or ssfr ) , as calibrated for star forming galaxies ( see fig . 11 in b04 ) .",
    "these estimates have been corrected in the latest mpa - jhu dr7 release by using improved dust attenuations and improved aperture corrections for non - sf galaxies following the work by @xcite .",
    "gas - phase oxygen abundances , 12+log(o / h ) , are available for star forming galaxies as calculated by @xcite . thoughout this paper",
    "we adopt the spectral line measurements as well as estimates of sfr , metallicity and dust extinction given by the mpa - jhu catalog .",
    "the sdss pipeline calculates several kinds of magnitudes . in this work",
    "we have adopted modified petrosian magnitudes for flux measurements , which capture a constant fraction of the total light independent of position and distance .",
    "when appropriate , we have also used model magnitudes ( _ modelmag _ ) as they provide the most reliable estimates of galaxy colors .",
    "magnitudes are corrected for galactic reddening using the dust maps of @xcite .",
    "we have crossmatched data from wise and the mpa - jhu catalog to construct a galaxy sample covering an effective area of 2344 deg@xmath14 , or 29% of the dr7 ( legacy ) spectroscopic footprint .",
    "wise sources were selected to have 12@xmath0 m fluxes above 1  mjy , also requiring objects to have clean photometry at 3.4 , 4.6 and 12@xmath0 m .",
    "for mpa - jhu sources , we selected objects with de - reddened petrosian magnitude @xmath31 and @xmath32-band surface brightness @xmath33  mag  arcsec@xmath34 .",
    "this selects a conservative version of the sdss main galaxy sample ( see @xcite ) . using a matching radius of 3@xmath23 we find 96,217 wise objects with single optical matches ( 40% of the sdss sample in the intersection area ) , and 73 sources with two or more counterparts .",
    "the latter are mostly large extended sources or close interacting systems of two members . for the rest of this paper we will focus on the single ir - optical matches that constitute the vast majority ( @xmath3599.9% ) of the galaxy population . by using random catalogs generated over the effective area ,",
    "the expected false detection fraction at 3@xmath23 is 0.05% .",
    "each region of the sky has been observed at least 10 times by wise , with the number of observations increasing substantially toward the ecliptic poles . within our effective area ,",
    "the median coverage depth at 12@xmath0 m is about 13 , varying tipically between 10 and 20 . at these levels ,",
    "the average completeness of the sample is expected to be over 90% , as shown in the wise preliminary release explanatory supplement ( sec .",
    "we derived stellar masses for all galaxies using the _ kcorrect _ algorithm ( @xcite ) , which fits a linear combination of spectral templates to the flux measurements for each galaxy .",
    "these templates are based on a set of @xcite models that span a wide range of star formation histories , metallicities and dust extinction .",
    "this algorithm yields stellar masses that differ by less than 0.1 dex on average from estimates using other methods ( for example , the method based on fitting the 4000 break strength and @xmath36 absorption index proposed by @xcite ) .    to derive restframe colors and monochromatic luminosities in the infrared we used the fitting code and templatesrjassef / lrt/ ] of @xcite , applied to our combined _ ugriz _ photometry plus wise 3.4  @xmath0 m , 4.6  @xmath0 m and 12@xmath0 m fluxes .",
    "@xcite present a set of low - resolution empirical spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates for galaxies and agn spanning the wavelength range from 0.03  @xmath0 m to 30  @xmath0 m , constructed with data from the noao deep wide - field survey botes field ( ndfws , @xcite ) and the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages , @xcite ) .",
    "the code fits three galaxy sed templates that represent an old stellar population ( elliptical ) , a continuously star - forming population ( spiral ) and a starburst component ( irregular ) , plus an agn sed template with variable reddening and igm absorption .",
    "these templates have been successfully used to test the reliability of irac agn selection , and to predict the color - color distribution of wise sources ( @xcite ) .",
    "we also use these templates to assess the relative contribution of agn to the energy budget .    instead of trying to derive a new calibration of the sfr in the ir , we take the approach of comparing ir luminosities directly to optical dust - corrected sfrs .",
    "this makes our results largely independent of any particular sfr calibration .",
    "note all optical sfrs used in this paper have been corrected for dust extinction .",
    "we begin our analysis by exploring the general properties of the wise 12@xmath0m - selected galaxy sample .",
    "the sample is composed of a mixture of 70% sf galaxies , 15% agn , 12% composite galaxies and 3% galaxies lacking bpt classification due to the absence of detectable lines in the spectra ( most lack h@xmath13 emission ) .",
    "the composition of the mpa - jhu optical sample is 44%  sf , 12% agn , 6% composite , 37% unclassifiable , which means that the 12@xmath0 m selection is highly efficient in recovering sf systems and avoids objects with weak or no emission lines . in terms of the total optical galaxy populations , 61% ( sf ) , 53% ( agn ) and",
    "76% ( composite ) of the sdss galaxies have 12@xmath0 m flux densities above 1  mjy . in figure",
    "[ fig : dist_lumw3 ] ( top row ) we plot the distribution of redshift , stellar mass , d@xmath29 index and restframe @xmath37 color for sf galaxies , agn and composite systems , as well as for the three classes all together .",
    "the majority of wise - sdss 12@xmath0 m sources are sf galaxies at @xmath38 with stellar masses of @xmath39m@xmath30 ; these are typical values for the sf class .",
    "they clearly populate the blue peak of the galaxy bimodal distribution around @xmath40 and have inherently young stellar populations ( d@xmath411.3 , or ages of @xmath40.5  gyr ) .",
    "agn are , as expected , comparatively more massive ( m@xmath42m@xmath30 ) , redder ( @xmath43 ) and older ( @xmath41 - 6  gyr ) , dominating the massive end of the 12@xmath0 m galaxy distribution . as a population , agn",
    "do not differ significantly ( in terms of these properties ) in comparison to the corresponding purely optical sample .",
    "composite galaxies present intermediate properties between the sf and agn samples .",
    "note that the bulk of galaxies lacking bpt classification ( due to weak or absent emission lines ) is missed in our ir - optical sample .",
    "these objects primarily populate the red sequence of the galaxy distribution ( e.g. @xcite ) and hence are not expected to be prominent at 12@xmath0 m .",
    "we then divide the sample into three subsamples of monochromatic infrared luminosity : faint ( @xmath44 ) , intermediate ( @xmath45 ) , and bright ( @xmath46 ) sources .",
    "there are no large biases with redshift , i.e. the different classes are sampled roughly without preference at all luminosities .",
    "both sf galaxies and agn become more massive for higher ir luminosities and we have checked that this also holds in narrow redshift slices . as we will show below , this is due to the coupling between the ir and the optical emission .",
    "interestingly , the 12@xmath0 m sf galaxies change by a factor of 0.8  dex in mass toward high 12@xmath0 m luminosities while keeping the same color and stellar content .",
    "the agn population , while getting slightly more massive , becomes bluer and dominated by younger stars as ir luminosity increases .",
    "figure  [ fig : zlumw3 ] shows the redshift distribution of the restframe 12@xmath0 m luminosity for our sample .",
    "it can be seen that while high luminosity sources naturally lie at higher redshifts , the redshift distribution of the different classes is very similar , except at the lowest redshifts ( @xmath47 ) where very few agn / composite galaxies are observed .",
    "the absence of red sequence galaxies in our sample is not surprising , but there is also a number of sf galaxies without ir emission due to our flux limit .",
    "figure  [ fig : dist_sf ] shows the mass , redshift and colors of sf galaxies with and without 12@xmath0 m emission , as well as for the entire sf optical sample . on average , sf galaxies not present in our sample have bluer colors , lie at lower redshifts , and have stellar masses around @xmath48m@xmath30 , roughly an order of magnitude below the 12@xmath0 m sf galaxy sample . at this level",
    ", galaxies have very little dust mass , and hence can not re - radiate much in the ir .",
    "the main result here is that wise 12@xmath0m - selected galaxies are primarly typical blue sequence ( sf ) galaxies .",
    "it is safe to assume that the majority of blue sequence galaxies correspond to late morphological types ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "agn and composite objects are also represented , belonging either to the red sequence or to a transitional regime among the two former classes .",
    "it is interesting that the detection efficiency is largest for composite systems , which was also found by @xcite for 24  @xmath0 m sources that lie in the so called _ green valley _ ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this is a region located between the red and blue cloud sequences , best identified in the nuv - r color - magnitude diagram , where sf activity is being actively quenched and galaxies are thought to be in transitional stage in their migration from the blue to the red sequence .",
    "most galaxies in our sample are either normal luminosity ir galaxies ( @xmath49l@xmath30 ; 60% ) , low luminosity ir galaxies ( @xmath50l@xmath30 ; 31% ) or luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs ; @xmath51l@xmath30 ; 9% ) .",
    "however , ulirgs are also present .",
    "there are 114 objects with @xmath52l@xmath30 ( roughly equivalent to @xmath53l@xmath30 using the conversion of @xcite ) , corresponding to a surface density of 0.049  deg@xmath34 .",
    "this is comparable to the 0.041  deg@xmath34 surface density found by @xcite .",
    "these ulirgs naturally lie at higher redshift ( @xmath54 ) and populate the massive end of the sf sequence above @xmath55m@xmath30 .",
    "we reiterate that these results come from matching wise to the relatively bright sdss spectroscopic sample .",
    "wise galaxy populations down to @xmath5622.6 are analyzed in @xcite .",
    "we now have a large sample of 12@xmath0m - selected galaxies that range from low - ir to ulirg luminosities , for which high quality optical spectra and dust - corrected optical sfrs are available .",
    "first we examine the relation between @xmath7 and stellar mass . b04",
    "have shown that , at least for star forming systems , sfr and stellar mass are strongly correlated in the local universe .",
    "there is also evidence that this relationship evolves with redshift ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although it is expected that more massive galaxies are naturally more luminous , it is unclear whether more massive systems would have more dust emission in the mid - ir .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass_lumw3_sptype ] shows the correlation between monochromatic 12@xmath0 m luminosity and stellar mass for our sample .",
    "the correlation is tight for sf systems over nearly three orders of magnitude in stellar mass ( gray points , top panels ) .",
    "several studies have found that the distributions of [ oiii ] emission line flux to the agn continuum flux at x - ray , mid / far - ir and radio wavelengths ( i.e. where stellar emission and absorption by the torus are least significant ) are very similar for both type i and type ii agn ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . based on this , @xcite and @xcite have shown that [ oiii ] flux is a reliable estimator of agn activity . following these works",
    ", we split the agn sample by [ oiii ] luminosity .",
    "we see that strong agn ( @xmath57}>10^{7}$]l@xmath30 ) have ir luminosities considerably larger than weak agn ( @xmath57}<10^{7}$]l@xmath30 ) , following approximately the same relationship with mass as sf systems .",
    "weak agn , instead , lie well below that correlation and show a larger scatter . we note that the contribution by star forming regions to the [ oiii ] flux is @xmath587% ( @xcite ) .    in the right bottom panel of figure",
    "[ fig : mass_lumw3_sptype ] we compare the ages of stars in all subsamples as derived from the d@xmath29 spectral index .",
    "sf galaxies have the youngest stellar populations , peaking at @xmath40.5  gyr , followed by considerably older composite galaxies ( @xmath41.5 - 2  gyr ) .",
    "strong agn , which dominate the massive end , have intermediate stellar populations ( @xmath41.5  gyr ) that are closer to sf / composite systems than to weak agn ( see fig . [",
    "fig : dist_lumw3 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , weak agn tend to be hosted by early - type galaxies with significantly older stars ( @xmath43  gyr ) as found also by @xcite after comparing agn host sizes , surface densities and concentration ratios with those of normal early - type galaxies .",
    "this highlights the importance that young / old stars have in powering the 12@xmath0 m emission .",
    "for agn of roughly similar stellar mass , only when younger stars begin to dominate ( and the active nuclei becomes more powerful ) is the ir emission comparable to actively star - forming systems .",
    "qualitatively , the same result holds if we use the dust - corrected @xmath32-band absolute magnitude instead of stellar mass .",
    "since galaxies of different ages have very different ir output , an interesting question to address is how the 12@xmath0 m luminosity budget depends upon the age of the stellar populations .",
    "figure  [ fig : lumage ] shows the cumulative fraction of the _ integrated _ 12@xmath0 m luminosity produced in galaxies of a given age . in sf galaxies , @xmath480% of the total ir luminosity is produced by galaxies younger than 0.6  gyr .",
    "composite galaxies and strong agn reach the same fraction at ages of 1.5  gyr and 2  gyr , respectively . in weak agn , instead , most of the mid - ir emission is produced within a range of @xmath41 - 3  gyr .",
    "this inventory of 12@xmath0 m luminosity in the local universe shows where the bulk of the ir emission resides , shifting from stellar populations of a few hundred myr in actively sf galaxies to a few gyr in galaxies hosting weak agn .",
    "thus , it underlines again the important role that young / old stars have in powering 12@xmath0 m emission . as we will see later in section",
    "[ sec : ssfr ] , this also supports the idea that transition galaxies ( i.e. composite / strong agn ) form a smooth sequence that joins highly active galaxies with quiescent galaxies .",
    "we now explore the relationship between infrared luminosity and optical , dust - corrected sfr .",
    "figure  [ fig : ltir_sfr_d4000 ] shows @xmath7 versus @xmath59 , color - coded by the d@xmath29 spectral index . as discussed by @xcite , the d@xmath29 index is a good indicator of the mean age of the stellar population in a galaxy .",
    "the dashed line indicates the reference relation of @xcite , as given by @xcite in terms of 12@xmath0 m luminosity , to convert ir luminosity into `` instantaneous '' sfr .",
    "it was derived from simple theoretical models of stellar populations with ages 10 - 100  myr without considering factors like metallicity or more complex star formation histories . while this makes it strictly valid only for young starbursts ,",
    "the kennicutt relation is quite often applied to the more general population of star forming galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : ltir_sfr_d4000 ] shows that the ir emission from sf galaxies ( left panel ) correlates fairly well with @xmath59 .",
    "the correlation is tighter for high sfrs becoming broader and slightly asymmetric for low sfrs .",
    "a least - squares fit to the sf sample is given by @xmath60 this expression is close to the @xcite relation at high sfrs , which is not surprising given that relation was calibrated using the iras bright galaxy sample ( @xcite ) , i.e. luminous galaxies with @xmath61l@xmath30 .",
    "the small differences are likely attributable to luminosity / redshift selection effects and the slight differences between iso and wise @xmath62 m filters .",
    "more importantly , the agreement is quite good considering the different origin ( fir vs optical emission lines ) of the sfrs .",
    "relative to the @xcite conversion , @xmath7 is comparatively suppressed by a factor @xmath63 for @xmath59 below @xmath40.1m@xmath30yr@xmath9 .",
    "this is likely because low sfr systems have very low stellar masses ( @xmath64m@xmath30 ) , and therefore become more transparent due to the increasing fraction of stellar light that escapes unabsorbed by dust .",
    "we note , however , that the spatial distrbution of dust in hii regions and/or molecular clouds could also have influence ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , we have repeated the test for the bluest galaxies in the sf galaxy class , obtaining no significant differences .",
    "this suggests that other effects like metallicity could also be relevant .    for agn",
    ", the coupling between optical sfr and ir luminosity follows a different relationship ( right panel of figure  [ fig : ltir_sfr_d4000 ] ) .",
    "most agn lie in a broader distribution _ above _ the instantaneous conversion of kennicutt , particularly those with @xmath59 below @xmath41m@xmath30yr@xmath9 . for a fixed sfr ,",
    "the ir emission is higher by a factor of several relative to sf galaxies , suggesting that @xmath7 is not driven by the current sf for most agn .",
    "weak agn are predominantely associated with massive , early - type galaxies increasingly dominated by old stars at low sfrs ( @xmath40.1m@xmath30yr@xmath9 ) .",
    "given their red optical colors , it is unlikely that recent sf could be responsible for their ir emission .",
    "more likely , dust grains heated due to older stars or an agn are driving this emission . note , however , that in section  [ sec : agn_effect ] we will show that the contribution of agn at 12@xmath0 m is of minor importance for most agn , except perhaps for most powerful ones",
    ". only strong agn , which are dominated by intermediate - to - young stellar populations , tend to occupy a region similar to sf galaxies in figure  [ fig : ltir_sfr_d4000 ] .",
    "they show a clear `` excess '' in @xmath7 at @xmath650.5m@xmath30yr@xmath9 that gradually decreases when stars get younger toward higher sfrs .",
    "this shows that the age of stars in an agn is an important factor in determining the origin of the 12@xmath0 m emission .",
    "an expression fitting agn ( weak and strong ) is given by @xmath66 recent work by @xcite compared nuv / optical sfrs with @xmath67 calibrated from 24  @xmath0 m fluxes for red and green sequence objects at @xmath68 ( corresponding to restframe 14@xmath0 m , close to the wise 12@xmath0 m band ) .",
    "they find large excess ir emission for a given sfr , attributed mainly to older stellar populations , and to a lesser extent to an agn .",
    "we find broadly consistent results , but for 12@xmath0m - selected agn sources with optical sfrs .",
    "@xcite have suggested that thermally pulsating agb carbon stars ( tp - agb ) with ages of 0.2 - 1.5  gyr ( corresponding to d@xmath411.2 - 1.5 ) can also contribute significantly to the mid - ir flux . as seen in section [ sec : lumass ] , this does not seem to be important for our much older , weak agn , and perhaps marginally relevant in strong agn that have typical stellar ages slightly above the upper 1.5  gyr limit .",
    "the case of sf galaxies is interesting because most of the 12  @xmath0 m luminosity seems to originate from galaxies in the @xmath40.3 - 0.6  gyr age range and this luminosity correlates relatively well with the optical sfr . while the age ranges seems to overlap , it is difficult to prove whether tp - agb dominate the emission or not . further sed decomposition and modeling of stellar populations is required to find the fraction of mid - ir luminosity powered by tp - agb stars , a task that is potentially complicated by metallicity effects and uncertainties in the ensemble colors of such stars .",
    "however , the general picture is consistent with previous results ( @xcite ; @xcite ) that find evidence for the mid - ir being sensitive to star formation over relatively long ( @xmath351.5  gyr ) timescales .    finally , we consider composite systems , which present considerable sf activity along with spectral signatures of an agn ( middle panel of figure  [ fig : ltir_sfr_d4000 ] ) . by definition ,",
    "these objects have up to 40% ( see b04 ) of their h@xmath13 emission coming from a non - stellar origin , though the fraction is @xmath5815% for most galaxies . with masses , ages and optical colors",
    "intermediate between the sf and agn sequences , composite galaxies closely follow the kennicutt relation , except at the low sfr end where older stars once again begin to dominate .",
    "a least - squares fit for composite galaxies has a slope intermediate between agn and sf galaxies , and is given by @xmath69 we note that the optical sfrs utilized here , while not ideal , are probably the best estimates publicly available for such a large and diverse population of galaxies in the local universe",
    ". other methodologies that use more sophisticated dust corrections and employ h@xmath70 , fir or radio data could provide more accurrate values , but are difficult to apply across the entire sample and data are not always available ( see @xcite for a calibration of sfr based on h@xmath70 masses ) .",
    "this is particularly relevant for sfrs in agn , which can present large @xmath350.5 dex formal errors ( see figure 14 of @xcite ) .",
    "we have verified that the sdss sfrs in our sample are in broad agreement with uv - based sfrs derived by @xcite ( s. salim , private communication ) , with an average offset / scatter of 0.055/0.387 for the total sample ( 0.013/0.334 for strong agn , 0.242/0.567 for weak agn ) .",
    "wise is less sensitive at 22  @xmath0 m than at 12@xmath0 m , but a significant fraction of our sample ( @xmath430% ) has measured 22  @xmath0 m fluxes above 5  mjy ( note we find no 22  @xmath0 m galaxies without 12@xmath0 m detection ) .",
    "similar to the 12@xmath0 m sample , this 22  @xmath0 m subsample is a mixture comprised of 65%  sf galaxies , 14%  agn and 19%  composite systems .",
    "however , the fraction of strong agn is 38% , compared to 16% for 12@xmath0 m sources . as 22",
    "@xmath0 m is closer to the dust emission peak and is not affected by pah emission features , it is interesting to compare with the 12@xmath0 m galaxies of our previous analysis . figure  [ fig : ltir_sfr_d4000 ] shows the linear fits for the 22  @xmath0 m subsample ( triangle markers ) .",
    "these relations are very similar to the 12@xmath0 m fits ( solid line for sf galaxies , square markers for agn and composite galaxies ) , supporting the independence of our results on the particularities of a single mid - ir band .      given the strong correlations between optical or ir light and stellar mass , a more interesting metric for comparison is the specific star formation rate , ssfr or sfr / m@xmath30 , that measures the current relative to past sfr needed to build up the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "the ssfr traces the star formation efficiency and its inverse defines the timescale for galaxy formation or the time the galaxy required to build up its current mass .",
    "higher values of ssfr are indicative of a larger fraction of stars being formed recently . while ideally we would use gas mass or total mass instead of stellar mass for the normalization , such masses are not easily measured .",
    "figure  [ fig : ltir_ssfr_sptype_metal ] shows the ssfr as a function of 12@xmath0 m luminosity for the different galaxy classes .",
    "the nearly flat correlation for sf galaxies means that no matter the ir output , the amount of star formation per unit mass remains relatively constant .",
    "sf galaxies display a weak dependence with @xmath7 that gets narrower towards higher luminosities .",
    "as noted before , a possible origin for such residual ssfr could be due to a metallicity gradient .",
    "@xcite studied individual star forming regions of fixed aperture in nearby galaxies with known pa@xmath13 surface density , and found that low metallicity galaxies have a small deficit in 24  @xmath0 m emission compared to high metallicity galaxies .",
    "@xcite confirmed that while 24  @xmath0 m luminosity is a good metallicity - independent tracer for the sfr of individual hii regions , the metallicity effect should be taken into account when analyzing sfrs integrated over the whole galaxy .",
    "we test qualitatively for a metallicity effect by calculating the sfr per unit mass per unit metallicity , where the metallicity is given by the 12+log(o / h ) gas - phase oxygen abundance derived from optical nebular emission lines .",
    "the sf population displays an almost perfectly flat relationship over almost 4 orders of magnitude in @xmath7 such that independent of ir output , a galaxy of given mass and metal content converts gas into stars at a nearly constant rate . we note that these metallicities represent the current metal abundance rather than the luminosity - weighted average of past stellar populations .",
    "they also do not suffer from complications due to @xmath13-element enhancement or age uncertainties , characteristic of methods relying on absorption - line indices .",
    "@xcite arrive at a similar conclusion regarding a constant ssfr in nearby galaxies using herschel 250@xmath0 m and wise 3.4@xmath0 m data .",
    "compared to sf galaxies , agn have ssfrs lower by a factor of @xmath410 , mainly because of their higher stellar masses .",
    "however , strong agn lie much closer to the sf sequence than weak agn .",
    "the former are hosted by high stellar mass galaxies , but also have young stellar populations that drive up the sfr at high @xmath7 .",
    "weak agn do not have this boost in sfr and hence have lower ssfrs . once again , composite systems populate a region intermediate between sf galaxies and strong agn .",
    "previous studies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) have shown the relationship between the sfr and @xmath71 , identifying two different sequences : galaxies on a star - forming sequence and galaxies with little or no detectable sf .",
    "while the general result is that the ssfr of massive , red galaxies is lower at @xmath72 , the exact dependence of ssfr on mass is still a matter of debate , particularly in view of recent results that trace the evolution at higher redshift ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; but see the discussion by @xcite ) . in our sample of sf galaxies",
    "we find that the dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath71 is such that the efficiency by which gas is transformed into stars is nearly independent of the ir emission reprocessed by the dust . in strong agn",
    "the star formation activity is `` suppressed '' moderately , but considerably more in the case of weak agn .",
    "this suggests a sequence where a strong - agn phase is a continuation of the sf sequence at high stellar mass , that gradually turns agn into a population with weakened sf activity and lower @xmath7 , dominated by older and redder stars .",
    "based on optical data , @xcite found that strong agn hosts are indeed populated by relatively young stars , suggesting many of them could be post - starburst systems with extended star formation . with uv data , @xcite showed there is a close connection between massive sf galaxies and strong agn . using ir data , we find that the smooth sequence of galaxies from figures [ fig : ltir_sfr_d4000 ] and [ fig : ltir_ssfr_sptype_metal ] supports the hypothesis of strong agn being the continuation at the massive - end of the normal sf sequence .",
    "an interesting question is whether the mid - ir luminosity in powerful agn is driven by `` normal '' ongoing sf , or by hot dust left over _",
    "after _ the last episode of sf .",
    "further investigation is required to fully understand this matter .",
    "recent work on resolved nearby galaxies has shown a definite correlation between ir color and luminosity .",
    "@xcite found that for a variety of sources ranging from ulirgs to blue compact dwarf galaxies , the flux ratio @xmath73 traces the ssfr and also correlates with the compactness of star forming regions .",
    "while ideally we would like to know the sfr surface density , we first explore the relation between ssfr and 4.612@xmath0 m galaxy color , as shown in figure [ fig : ssfr_w2w3_sptype ] .",
    "galaxies from the main sf sequence ( blue contours ) correlate strongly with ir color , with strong agn ( black contours ) continuing the trend at bluer colors .",
    "weak agn extend ( red contours ) that relationship remarkably well toward the low star formation end , albeit with higher dispersion and a slightly steeper slope .",
    "hence , for the same increase in ssfr , agn experience a smaller variation in ir color than typical sf objects .",
    "this is probably due to the combination of a metallicity effect and the different stellar populations that regulate the ir emission budget . in any case",
    ", this suggests that the higher the ssfr , the more prominent the 12@xmath0 m ir emission becomes relative to 4.6  @xmath0 m , where the latter is expected to strongly correlate with stellar mass .",
    "this shows that the 4.612@xmath0 m color serves well as a rough first - order indicator of star formation activity over three orders of magnitude in sfr .",
    "a simple expression fitting all galaxies is given by @xmath74 if the galaxy is known to host an agn , the more accurate expression is @xmath75 these results show that there is a tight link between stellar mass , current star formation rate and ir color in sf galaxies , which emphasizes the role of the dominant stellar population in regulating star formation .      in the previous sections we noted that the emission from the agn could have a significant effect on the ir emission , and potentially bias the luminosities of the agn galaxy class",
    ". this could be particularly important for low sfr galaxies .",
    "we test for this effect by estimating the contribution of the agn to the total energy budget for sources classified from the bpt diagram as either an agn or as an sf galaxy .",
    "to do so , we analyze the fraction of the 12@xmath0 m luminosity contributed by each of the four templates used in the sed fitting process to our optical+ir photometry , paying particular attention to the agn component .",
    "figure  [ fig : atype_sf ] shows the median fraction of 12@xmath0 m luminosity contributed by each template , for objects classified as sf galaxies .",
    "the majority of the power is split among the irregular ( i m ) , spiral ( sbc ) and elliptical ( e ) templates , though the agn contribution becomes significant for the most luminous sources , above @xmath76 .",
    "this implies that the agn has a negligible influence in sf galaxies .",
    "figure  [ fig : atype_agn ] shows these fractions for weak and strong agn galaxy classes .",
    "the elliptical component is now more prominent in weak agn of low luminosity , which is not unexpected . in general , the agn component is now more important but is still far from contributing significantly below @xmath76 . in most weak agn ( @xmath480% )",
    "the agn contribution to the 12@xmath0 m luminosity is below 40% .",
    "about @xmath470% of strong agn show similar low agn contributions at 12@xmath0 m .",
    "we note that in figure  [ fig : atype_agn ] we used wise aperture photometry for extended , nearby sources and profile - fitting magnitudes for unresolved galaxies with @xmath77 ( see section 4.5 of wise preliminary release explanatory supplement for further details ) . although the differences are small , aperture photometry improves the quality of the sed fit of low luminosity galaxies , as it captures the more extended flux of objects at low redshifts .",
    "note that in both cases , sf galaxies and agn , the emission is dominated by the spiral ( sbc ) component , which has a relatively high mid - ir sed .",
    "this is because the template , originally constructed from @xcite and extended into the uv and ir with @xcite synthesis models , also considers emission in the mid - ir from dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "these are added by ad hoc linear combinations of appropriate parts of ngc 4429 and m82 seds obtained by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : seds_agn ] shows the sed fit for agn with luminosities of @xmath5}\\sim10 ^ 6\\ , l_\\odot$ ] and @xmath5}\\sim10 ^ 7\\ , l_\\odot$ ] . in each case",
    "we plot the object with the median @xmath78 , i.e. the typical fit for sources of those luminosities .",
    "the 9 photometric bands are well fitted by the model in most cases .",
    "for agn with @xmath5}>10^{7.5}\\ , l_\\odot$ ] we find the sed fit is reasonably good ( although in general with higher @xmath78 ) except at the 22@xmath0 m band .",
    "we believe this is caused by the limitation of the algorithm ( not the templates themselves ) to properly fit highly reddened agn fainter than their hosts , as it is designed to punish the excessive use of reddening on the agn when few relevant data points are used . modifying the algorithm slightly to remove this behavior ,",
    "we are able to obtain fits with better @xmath78 values for these objects assigning much higher agn fractions and reddening values , yet the lack of farther ir data to determine the origin of the 22@xmath0 m excess makes these numbers also uncertain . therefore , while these results do not definitely rule out that the central agn could have a considerable effect in some extreme sources ( e.g. the very strong agn ) , it certainly shows that they are not relevant for most of the galaxy populations analyzed in this paper .",
    "in this work we have taken advantage of recently released data from wise and sdss to construct the largest ir - optical sample of galaxies with 12@xmath0 m fluxes and optical spectra available at @xmath79 .",
    "this sample allowed us to investigate with high statistical significance how physical parameters such as color , stellar mass , metallicity , redshift , and sfr of 12@xmath0m - selected galaxies compare with purely optically selected samples .",
    "we have quantified how the sfr estimates compare for the different spectral types as a function of stellar mass , galaxy age and ir color in order to pinpoint the underlying source of 12@xmath0 m emission and therefore up to what extent it could be interpreted as a useful sfr indicator .      * in general , the wise - sdss 12@xmath0m - selected galaxy population traces the blue , late - type , low mass sequence of the bimodal galaxy distribution in the local universe .",
    "it also traces intermediate - type objects with active nuclei , avoiding the bulk of the red and `` dead '' galaxies without emission lines .",
    "most sources have normal to lirg luminosities , but ( few ) ulirgs are also present .",
    "* the ir emission of sf galaxies and strong agn , dominated by the blue , young stellar population component , is well correlated with the optical sfr .",
    "there is a small tendency of low sfr systems to have slighly lower ir luminosity when compared to the canonical relation of @xcite .",
    "these are low sfr , low mass systems that likely become more transparent due to the increasing fraction of light that escapes unabsorbed and hence suppresses @xmath80 .",
    "however other effects like the dust distribution or metallicity could be relevant as well .",
    "the latter is shown by the ( weak ) ssfr dependence on @xmath81 .",
    "in general , the mid - ir emission at 22@xmath0 m follows similar correlations seen for the 12@xmath0m - selected sample , suggesting that these results do not critically depend on a single ir band .",
    "* sf galaxies are forming stars at an approximately constant rate per unit mass for an ir output ranging over five orders of magnitude .",
    "there is small tendency for more luminous objects to have enhanced ssfr , which could be interpreted as a sign of sf histories peaking toward later times .",
    "however , this residual dependence seems to be caused by a metallicity gradient .",
    "once factored out , the relationship becomes nearly flat .",
    "strong agn behave as a continuation at the massive - end of the normal sf sequence , where the agn ( possibly after a starburst episode ) gradually quenches sf and weakens as it consumes the gas available , with the mid - ir emission fading in consequence .",
    "* the mid - ir 4.612@xmath0 m restframe color can be used as a first - order indicator of the overall sf activity in a galaxy , as it correlates well with the specific sfr . for increasing sfr / m@xmath82 ,",
    "the ir emission becomes more prominent at 12@xmath0 m ( associated with dust emission ) relative to 4.6  @xmath0 m ( associated with stellar mass ) .",
    "* for the case of sf galaxies , most of the mid - ir luminosity distribution is concentrated in systems younger than @xmath40.5  gyr .",
    "redder galaxies are dominated by older stellar populations , which contribute increasingly to the 12@xmath0 m emission . while many of these galaxies host an agn ( usually weak ) the 12@xmath0 m energy budget is generally not dominated by the central active nuclei .",
    "this might well not be the case of bright galaxies with very strong active nuclei ( @xmath5}>10 ^ 7.5\\ , l_\\odot$ ] ) where a considerably larger fraction of mid - ir emission could be due to the agn .",
    "spatially resolved , longer wavelength ir data and further modeling is necessary to fully understand these sources .",

    "<S> this suggests a picture where galaxies form stars normally until an agn ( possibly after a starburst episode ) starts to gradually quench the sf activity . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that 4.612@xmath0 m color is a useful first - order indicator of sf activity in a galaxy when no other data are available . </S>"
