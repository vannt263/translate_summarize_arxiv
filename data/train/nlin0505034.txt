    "laboratory studies of two - dimensional turbulence are affected by the interaction with the three - dimensional environment in which they are embedded .",
    "this interaction is often frictional and generates an additional linear damping term to the equation of motion . a well known example , which is the object of the present letter , is the flow in a shallow layer of fluid , which is subject to the friction with the bottom of the tank where it is contained @xcite .",
    "another example is the motion of a soap film dumped from the interaction with the surrounding air @xcite .",
    "linear friction dumping is not restricted to laboratory experiments : an important example is the ekman friction in geophysical fluid dynamics @xcite .    as predicted in a remarkable paper by kraichnan in 1967 @xcite , when a two - dimensional layer of fluids is forced at intermediate scales , smaller than the domain - size and larger than the viscous dissipative length - scales ,",
    "two different inertial ranges are observed .",
    "this is a consequence of the coupled conservation of energy ( mean square velocity ) and enstrophy ( mean square vorticity ) in the inviscid limit , a basic difference with respect to three - dimensional turbulence phenomenology .",
    "the energy flows toward the large scales giving rise to an inverse energy cascade characterized by the @xmath1 kolmogorov spectrum .",
    "small scale statistics is governed by a direct enstrophy cascade which is expected to develop a smooth flow with @xmath0 energy spectrum , with a possible logarithmic correction @xcite .",
    "the presence of a linear friction term affects the direct cascade in a dramatic way : the enstrophy flux across scales is no longer constant and the scaling exponent of the spectrum differs from the kraichnan prediction @xmath0 by a correction proportional to the friction intensity @xcite .",
    "the origin of this correction can be understood exploiting the analogy between two - dimensional vorticity field and a scalar field passively advected by a smooth velocity field @xcite . for the case of a passive scalar with a finite lifetime it is possible to obtain explicit expressions for the scaling exponents of the power spectrum and structure functions which depend on the intensity of the linear dumping and on the statistics of finite - time lyapunov exponents @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we experimentally study the statistic of the direct enstrophy cascade in a two - dimensional flow generated in an electromagnetically driven thin layer of fluid .",
    "this experimental setup has been successfully used for studying several problems connected to two - dimensional turbulence @xcite . here",
    "we show that the friction with the bottom of the tank induces a correction on the spectral slope at large wave - numbers , in good agreement with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "the experimental apparatus consists of a squared plexiglas tank whose dimensions are @xmath2 cm .    the tank is filled with two layers of fluid , subsequentially injected from the bottom . the upper layer of fresh water is placed over a bottom layer of an electrolyte solution of water and nacl ( density @xmath3 ) . at the end of the filling procedure",
    "we obtain a stable stratification with controlled fluids thickness . in all the experiments",
    "the fluid thickness @xmath4 for the lower fluid has been maintained equal to @xmath5 while the thickness of the upper fluid @xmath6 varies between @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the total thickness of the two layers will be denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "grid for the run @xmath10 ( see table  [ table1 ] ) . ]",
    "neodymium permanent magnets are placed below the bottom of the tank and disposed in four triangles with magnetic field in the vertical direction and alternating sign ( see fig.[fig:1 ] ) .",
    "an electric current , horizontally driven through the cell , interacts with the magnetic field and moves the nacl solution via the lorenz force .",
    "the forcing current is generated by a computer controlled power supply which provides voltage signal of fixed amplitude and randomly alternating direction .",
    "the correlation time for voltage sign reversal is tipically @xmath11 .",
    "the combined action of electric and magnetic forcing on the nacl solution induces the continuous formation of opposite signed vortical structures whose characteristic length - scale @xmath12 is related to the distance between opposite - signed magnets and whose characteristic time - scale is of the order of voltage sign reversal .",
    "the free fluid surface is seeded using tiny buoyant styrene particles ( with typical size @xmath13 ) , and the test section is illuminated using an array of lamps placed orthogonally to one side of the tank .",
    "the fluid flow is recorded using a standard speed video camera .",
    "a maximum duration of 6 minutes is chosen for each experiment , to ensure that both density stratification and two - dimensionality are maintained @xcite .",
    "the velocity field has been reconstructed by image analysis based on a feature tracking ( ft ) approach@xcite .",
    "this tracking procedure allows for higher seeding densities than classical particle tracking velocimetry , and provides an accurate reconstruction of a large number ( almost 20000 ) of lagrangian trajectories .",

    "further this is a confirmation _ a posteriori _ of the irrelevance of the viscous term .",
    "the remarkable prediction made in @xcite is that for any @xmath34 the kraichnan scaling exponent in the direct cascade has a correction proportional to @xmath19 .",
    "the argument is based on an analogy with the dynamics of a scalar with finite lifetime @xmath37 passively transported by a smooth flow , which is governed by an equation formally identically to ( [ eq:1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "we remark that the extension of the passive scalar argument @xcite to the _ active _ vorticity field is not trivial , as @xmath38 determines the velocity field . for completenes , in the following we report the `` mean field '' derivation of the exponent correction , a complete derivation for the active case",

    "because of the incompressibility of the velocity field , after a time @xmath44 the blob is contracted in the transverse dimension to a scale @xmath45 .",
    "this is the mechanism for the _ direct cascade _ phenomenon , _",

    "taking into account the decay induced by the friction we can write @xmath47 in the statistically steady regime sustained by the forcing , this argument provides the scaling exponent for the second - order vorticity structure function : @xmath48 and thus the scaling exponent of the enstrophy spectrum @xmath49 .",
    "finally one obtain the mean field prediction for the energy spectrum @xcite @xmath50 with correction exponent @xmath51 .",
    "we remark that for @xmath34 the correction gives an energy spectrum steeper that @xmath0 which is a posteriori consistent with the assumption of smooth velocity field .",
    "a more refined version of this `` mean - field '' argument , which takes into account the fluctuations of the lyapunov exponents @xcite , can be made @xcite .",
    "the result is again a correction which makes the spectrum steeper than the kraichnan prediction .",
    "an extensive numerical study of two - dimensional navier - stokes equations with friction has confirmed the above theoretical picture @xcite .",
    "figures [ fig:5 ] , [ fig:6 ] and [ fig:7 ] shows the energy spectra obtained from fourier transform of the ft velocity data for three experiments with different total thickness in stationary conditions . the spectra are obtained by averaging over about @xmath52 realizations of the velocity field .",
