    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we report results on the study of charmless @xmath0 meson decays to three - kaon final states .",
    "the analysis is based on a 78.7fb@xmath1 data sample , which contains 85.0 million @xmath10 pairs , collected with the belle detector operating at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath3 ( 3.5 on 8  gev ) collider  @xcite with a center - of - mass energy at the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "all results reported here are preliminary .",
    "the belle detector  @xcite is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a three - layer silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) for charged particle tracking and specific ionization measurement ( @xmath11 ) , an array of aerogel threshold erenkov counters ( acc ) , time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an array of 8736 csi(tl ) crystals for electromagnetic calorimetry ( ecl ) located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath12 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) .",
    "electron identification is based on a combination of cdc @xmath11 measurements , the response of the acc , and the position , shape and energy deposition of the associated ecl shower .",
    "charged hadron identification is accomplished by combining the responses of the acc and the tof with @xmath11 measurements in the cdc into a single value using the likelihood method : @xmath13 where @xmath14 stands for the hadron type ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) .",
    "charged tracks are identified as protons , pions or kaons by imposing requirements on the likelihood ratios ( pid ) : @xmath18 at large momenta ( @xmath192.5 gev/@xmath20 ) only the acc and @xmath11 are used since the tof provides no significant separation of kaons and pions .",
    "we use a geant based monte carlo ( mc ) simulation to model the response of the detector and determine acceptance  @xcite .",
    "the selection criteria are similar to those used in the analysis of @xmath0 decays to the @xmath8 and @xmath9 final states  @xcite .",
    "charged tracks are selected with a set of track quality requirements based on the average hit residual and on the distances of closest approach to the interaction point in the plane perpendicular to the beam and the plane containing the beam and the track .",
    "we also require that the transverse track momenta be greater than 0.1  gev/@xmath20 to reduce the low momentum combinatorial background . for charged kaon identification",
    "we impose a requirement on pid(@xmath16 ) , which has 86% efficiency and a 7% fake rate from misidentified pions . charged tracks that are positively identified as electrons or protons",
    "are excluded .",
    "since the muon identification efficiency and fake rate vary significantly with the track momentum , we do not veto muons to avoid additional systematic errors .",
    "neutral kaons are reconstructed via the decay chain @xmath21 .",
    "the invariant mass of the two pions is required to be in the range @xmath22  mev/@xmath23 .",
    "the displacement of the @xmath24 vertex from the interaction point ( ip ) in the transverse ( @xmath25-@xmath26 ) plane is required to be greater than 0.1  cm and less than 20  cm .",
    "the direction of the combined pion pair momentum in the @xmath25-@xmath26 plane is required to be within 0.2 rad of the direction from the ip to the displaced vertex .",
    "we reconstruct @xmath0 mesons in the @xmath4 , @xmath27 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 three - body final states .",
    "the inclusion of the charge conjugate mode is implied throughout this report .",
    "the candidate events are identified by their center - of - mass ( c.m . )",

    "this allows for more detailed studies of the background . for subsequent analysis",
    ", we also define a _ signal _ region of @xmath35  mev/@xmath23 and @xmath36  gev and a @xmath37 _ sideband _ region defined as @xmath38  gev @xmath39  gev .    to determine the signal yield",
    ", we use events with @xmath40 in the signal region and fit the @xmath37 distribution to the sum of a signal distribution and an empirical background .",
    "the @xmath37 signal shape is parameterized by the sum of two gaussian functions with the same mean .",
    "the widths and the relative fractions of the two gaussians are determined from a mc simulation .",
    "we find that the signal mc simulation gives , in general , a narrower @xmath37 width than data .",
    "to correct for this , we introduce a scale factor that is determined from the comparison of the @xmath37 widths for @xmath41 events in mc and experimental data ; this correction is about 10% .",
    "the background from @xmath42 continuum events is represented by a linear function .",
    "the @xmath37 shape of the @xmath10 background is determined from mc simulation , as described below .",
    "to suppress the combinatorial background from @xmath43 continuum events , we use a set of variables that characterize the event topology .",
    "we require @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the angle between the thrust axis of the @xmath0 candidate and that of the rest of the event ; the distribution of @xmath46 is peaked near 1.0 for @xmath42 and is nearly flat for @xmath10 events .",
    "we also use a fisher discriminant  @xcite , @xmath47 , formed from nine variables of a `` virtual calorimeter ''  @xcite , the angle between the candidate thrust axis and beam axis , and the angle between the @xmath0 candidate direction and beam axis .",
    "we make a requirement on @xmath47 that rejects 53% of the remaining @xmath42 background while retaining 89% of the signal .",
    "we also consider backgrounds that come from other @xmath0 decays .",
    "we conventionally subdivide this background into two types .",
    "one type is the so called `` generic '' @xmath10 background that originates from the dominant @xmath48 tree transition .",
    "the description of these decays is taken from an updated version of the cleo group event generator  @xcite .",
    "we find that the dominant background from this source is due to @xmath49 decays , where @xmath14 stands for a charged pion or kaon . to suppress this background , we reject events where any two - particle invariant mass is consistent within 15  mev ( 2.5@xmath50 ) with @xmath51 , @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "we also reject events with a @xmath54 invariant mass that is consistent with @xmath55 ( @xmath56  mev ) .",
    "the other potential source of background is rare charmless @xmath0 decays that proceed via @xmath57 penguins or @xmath58 tree transitions .",

    "we studied a large set of potentially dangerous two- , three- , and four - body final states .",

    "charmless @xmath0 meson decays have attracted a considerable amount of attention in recent years , primarily because they provide a possible way to extract weak phases .",
    "an important check of the standard model would be provided by measurements of the same cp - violating parameter in different weak interaction processes .",
    "a good example is the comparison of the measurement of the coefficient of the cp violating @xmath82 term in the time dependent analysis of neutral @xmath0 meson decays . in @xmath83",
    "decays ( where @xmath84 denotes a charmonium state ) this coefficient is @xmath85 .",
    "precise measurements of @xmath85 ( also known as @xmath86 ) have recently been reported by the belle and babar experiments  @xcite .",
    "the best known candidates for @xmath87 penguin dominated processes where this quantity can be measured independently are @xmath88 and @xmath89 decays . however , these modes have small branching fractions of order @xmath90 ( including secondary branching fractions ) .",
    "thus , very large numbers of @xmath0 mesons are required to perform these measurements .",
    "this is especially true for the @xmath91 final state .",
    "the large signal observed in the three - body @xmath75 decay mode , where the @xmath92 two - body intermediate state gives a relatively small contribution , would significantly increase statistics if these events could be used .",
    "there are two possible complications : ( 1 ) whilst the @xmath92 state has fixed cp , the cp - parity of the three - body @xmath27 final state is not fixed .",
    "if the fractions of cp - even and cp - odd components are comparable , the @xmath27 state will not be useful for a cp violation measurement ; ( 2 ) possible @xmath58 tree contributions may introduce an additional weak phase in the @xmath75 amplitude and cloud the interpretation of any observed cp violation . the @xmath58 contribution in @xmath93",
    "is expected to be negligible ( since @xmath26 is a pure @xmath94 state ) , but this is not necessarily the case for the three - body @xmath27 final state . here",
    "we discuss the possibility of the use of the three - body @xmath75 decay mode for cp measurements .",
    "the decays of @xmath0 mesons to three - body @xmath95 final states can be described by @xmath58 tree - level spectator and @xmath96 one - loop penguin diagrams .",
    "although @xmath58 @xmath97-exchange and annihilation diagrams can also contribute to these final states , they are expected to be much smaller and we neglect them in the following discussion .",
    "@xmath0 meson decays to final states with odd numbers of kaons ( @xmath98-quarks ) are expected to proceed dominantly via the @xmath99 penguin transition since , for these cases , the @xmath58 tree contribution has an additional ckm suppression .",
    "in contrast , decays with two final state kaons proceed via the @xmath58 tree transition with no @xmath99 penguin contribution .",
    "this allows us to estimate the @xmath58 tree contribution to final states with three kaons via the analysis of @xmath9 final states .",
    "it is also important to note that the @xmath99 penguin transition is an isospin conserving process , while the @xmath58 tree and @xmath100 penguin transitions are isospin violating .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath63 decay in fig .",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams](d ) and expected to be the dominant contributor to the @xmath103 final state .",
    "a quantitative estimate of the size of the @xmath58 tree amplitude is provided by the ratio    @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the total amplitude for the @xmath63 decay and @xmath106 is its @xmath58 tree contribution .",
    "the @xmath107 factor , where @xmath108  mev and @xmath109  mev are pion and kaon decay constants , respectively , takes into account the corrections for su(3 ) breaking effects in the factorization approximation , and @xmath110 is the cabibbo angle ( @xmath111 )  @xcite . using the results for @xmath112 and @xmath63 branching fractions from table  [ tab : defitall ] ,",
