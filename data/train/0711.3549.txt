    "different carbon - based structures are considered as promising electrode material for field emission ( fe ) cathodes . in particular ,",
    "the field emission properties of single - walled ( swnt ) and multi - walled ( mwnt ) carbon nanotubes @xcite as well as graphite films @xcite are presently under intensive experimental and theoretical investigations . in experiment , many factors such as inhomogeneities at the cathode surface , surface contamination ( surface adsorbates and oxides ) , local electric fields and barriers , electronic structure of cathode , etc . can drastically change fe results  @xcite .",
    "in addition , these factors vary from one experiment to another thus markedly complicating the theoretical description .",
    "nevertheless , the electronic characteristics of cathodes should be equally manifested in different experiments .",
    "for this reason , the effect of electronic structure on the emission features of cathodes is of definite interest . for swnts",
    "this problem was studied numerically in @xcite by using an approach which can be called as a method of _ independent channels_.    in this paper , we present a rather simple modification of this method to study analytically the influence of the 3d band structure on the field emission current ( fec ) of crystalline graphite . as an illustration",
    ", we consider the case of swnt where our approach allows us to reproduce the fe results obtained in  @xcite .",
    "as is well - known , the electronic structure near the fermi energy of the crystalline graphite markedly depends on the weak interlayer interaction ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "accordingly , the fec in this case should be sensitive to the specific electronic structure . in order to show this",
    ", we consider the simplest possible modification of graphite ( hypothetical @xmath0 stacking ) where the three - dimensional energy spectrum was calculated analytically in  @xcite .",
    "two possible orientations of the applied electric field ( along and normal to the graphite layers ) are of our interest .",
    "the emitted current density can be written as  @xcite @xmath1 here the field emission is directed along the @xmath2-axis , @xmath3 is the electric charge , @xmath4 the planck constant , @xmath5 the energy , @xmath6 momentum , @xmath7^{-1}$ ] the fermi - dirac distribution function , @xmath8 the transmission probability of an electron through a potential barrier , and @xmath9 the group velocity .",
    "the integrals are over the first brillouin zone with account of the positivity of @xmath10 .",
    "notice that in most cases the using of infinite limits in integrals is a good approximation . for parabolic bands",
    "@xmath11 , and this relation is widely used in deriving the well - known fowler - nordheim equation . in the case of carbon nanotubes ,",
    "two important differences from the generally accepted consideration should be taken into account .",
    "first , an open swnt has a finite small radius which results in quantization of momentum . in this case",
    ", the corresponding integrals in ( [ main ] ) transform into sums .",
    "for example , choosing the axes like shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ]     is the circumference of the nanotube , @xmath12 is a thickness of the graphite layer.,width=151 ]    one has @xmath13 where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the circumference of the nanotube , @xmath12 the thickness of the graphite layer . for a swnt there exists only a single layer in the @xmath16-direction and , accordingly , there is exactly one term in the sum for @xmath17 .",
    "the number of terms for @xmath18 depends on the tube circumference @xmath15 .",
    "second , the energy near the fermi level for a single graphite layer ( graphene ) is approximated by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fermi velocity  @xcite .",
    "the electrons move in the @xmath21 plane , so that the energy does not depend on @xmath22 . since @xmath23 is quantized the energy @xmath24 turns out to be divided into a set of channels with @xmath25 where @xmath26 takes integer values .",
    "therefore , the current density ( [ main ] ) takes the form @xmath27 as is known , the dispersion relation for carbon nanotubes depends on their chirality ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . for a chiral vector @xmath28",
    "it can be written as @xmath29^{1/2}. \\label{eheh}\\ ] ] generally , there are two symmetric curves with a gap @xmath30 . however , at certain values of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath26 the gap turns out to be zero and one gets the linear dispersion relation . therefore , at fixed @xmath26 there exist one metallic branch and a set of semiconducting branches for a swnt with a given chirality .    as stated above , the condition @xmath33 imposes restrictions on the limits of integral in ( [ off ] ) .",
    "in addition , two approximations will be used .",
    "first , we consider the zero - temperature limit when the fermi - dirac distribution becomes the step function .",
    "second , we suggest that the transmission probability is given by the wkb approximation ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) in the form @xmath34\\right\\ } = b\\exp(d\\varepsilon)\\ ] ] where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the electric field , @xmath38 the work function , @xmath39 the dielectric constant , and we denoted @xmath40 and @xmath41 for convenience .",
    "the functions @xmath42 and @xmath43 describe a deviation of the barrier from the triangle form due to image effects and can be approximated by @xcite @xmath44 now we are able to calculate the @xmath26th term in the sum ( [ off ] ) . for the metallic branch the integration in ( [ off ] ) spreads from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "one obtains @xmath47 for semiconducting branches the range of integration in ( [ off ] ) is ( @xmath45 , @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 notice that the dispersion relation enters ( [ eee ] ) only through the gap .",
    "this agrees with the well - known fact that the group velocity and the density of states are canceled in the one - dimensional case @xcite .",
    "the sum over all branches in ( [ off ] ) gives the total fec .",
    "[ fig : tube ] shows the calculated emission current density , which is a current divided by the circumference of a nanotube .",
    "the parameter set is @xmath50 ev , @xmath51  m / s , @xmath52   , @xmath53 ev@xmath54 m@xmath55.,width=226 ]    for @xmath56 swnt the circumference is defined as @xmath57 with @xmath58 being the lattice constant .",
    "in fact , the main contribution to the sum in ( [ off ] ) comes from the first few terms corresponding to branches close to the fermi level .",
    "this is due to the exponential dependence of the fec on the gap . for metallic nanotubes ,",
    "the leading term is @xmath59 , so that @xmath60 . in the case of semiconducting nanotubes",
    ", the leading contribution comes from the @xmath26th term with the smaller gap in ( [ eee ] ) and , therefore , @xmath61 $ ] .",
    "a similar behavior was found numerically in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , comparing our results in fig .  [",
    "fig : tube ] with the exact numerical calculations in  @xcite one can find out a good qualitative agreement .",
    "notice that the quantitative difference is also not great and varies from a few to ten percent depending on the diameter of the nanotube .",
    "in comparison with  @xcite our points in fig .",
    "[ fig : tube ] are situated slightly lower for metallic nanotubes and slightly higher for semiconducting nanotubes .",
    "this difference can be explained by at least two reasons .",
    "first , we have used the simplified expression for the tunneling probability in ( [ dd ] ) where the image effects were approximated in a standard way ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "second , as distinct from  @xcite we consider the zero - temperature limit .",
    "in this section , we study a case of noninteracting graphite layers .",
    "the layers are oriented as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orient ] .        to calculate the fec",
    "we will use the method of independent channels described in the previous section .",
    "namely , let us consider the 2d graphite lattice with the born - von karman boundary conditions applied in the @xmath62 direction .",
    "this gives the natural quantization conditions . for layers of a large ( infinite )",
    "size the sum in ( [ off ] ) can be replaced by the integral @xmath63 , so that finally one obtains @xmath64 where the relation @xmath65 is taken into account .",
    "it is interesting to mention that this result is very similar to the fowler - nordheim formula @xmath66 indeed , the exponents are exactly the same and the preexponential factors differ only slightly .",
    "what is important , the @xmath67-dependence is equal in both cases . for the interlayer distance @xmath68  ",
    "one can estimate @xmath69 .",
    "generally , there are known three possible configurations of crystalline graphite : @xmath70 stacking sequence of hexagonal layers ( bernal structure ) , rhombohedral @xmath71 stacking , and @xmath72 stacking when layers of carbon atoms are located directly on top of each other  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 stacking is called hypothetical because it has not been observed yet in crystalline graphite . however , this configuration is expected in disordered or pregraphitic carbon  @xcite . in this paper , we consider the model of @xmath0 stacking which is the simplest one and allows us to study the effect of interlayer interaction on the emission properties analytically .",
    "let us consider the interacting graphite layers oriented parallelly to the electric field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : orient ] ) . in the framework of the @xmath0 model",
    "the interaction modifies the 3d band structure near the fermi level which can be written in a simple analytical form @xcite @xmath73 here the @xmath74 parameter represents the interaction between first - neighboring atoms in a layer , @xmath75 is related to the interaction between two atoms of the same projection on the @xmath21 plane , from two neighboring layers , and @xmath76 is the interlayer spacing . the influence of other parameters @xmath77 and @xmath78 introduced in @xcite is suggested to be negligible and only linear terms in @xmath79 perturbation expansion are taken into account .",
    "actually , the analysis in  @xcite shows that the maximum effect of the next - to - leading term ( breaking the cylindrical symmetry ) is of the order of five percent .",
    "the upper sign in ( [ 3ds ] ) corresponds to the conduction band , and the lower sign corresponds to the valence band , @xmath80 .    in compliance with ( [ 3ds ] )",
    "[ fig : fermi1 ] represents the fermi surface of the @xmath0 graphite .",
    "the fermi surface is composed of a hole pocket ( the valence band , sigh `` minus '' in ( [ 3ds ] ) ) and two half pockets of electrons ( sign `` plus '' in ( [ 3ds ] ) ) . in our case , the emission occurs along the z - axis .",
    "generally , the possible values of the momentum of emitting electrons with respect to the fermi surface can be collected into five different groups .",
    "we call them _ independent channels_.        solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi1 ] indicate five possible types of independent channels : ( 1 ) for an intermediate electron - hole region , ( 2,3 ) for holes , and ( 4,5 ) for electrons . for finite - size layers ,",
    "quantization of momentum in the @xmath81 plane occurs . in this case",
    ", the spectrum is written as @xmath82 where @xmath83 are integer , and @xmath84 lies in the region @xmath85 .",
    "the total fec is a sum of all channels .",
    "let us consider these contributions separately .",
    "the hole region is defined as @xmath86 . as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi1 ] there are two types of channels for the hole region and the channel 1 can be considered as an intermediate case .",
    "[ holechannel ] shows all possible one - dimensional dispersion relations for this case .",
    "the channel 3 crosses the fermi surface at two points while the channel 2 does not cross the fermi surface . for each channel @xmath87 .",

    "[ interl ] , there is a strong dependence of the fec from the interlayer distance .",
    "the less is this distance the more is the emission current .",
    "this is valid for both orientations",
    ". it would be interesting to check this finding in experiments with graphite crystals under pressure .",
    "notice that this result follows from the fact that the dos at the fermi level ( which is of the most importance in the emission process ) is determined by @xmath75 ( see @xcite ) . as is seen from fig . , [ interl ] , @xmath125 is more sensitive to @xmath16 than @xmath144 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath145 one has @xmath146 , which follows from the fact that the movement of electrons between layers is suppressed in the absence of the interlayer interaction .",
    "in conclusion , we have found that the band structure of the 3d graphite has a marked impact on the field emission current .",
    "experimentally , the field emission from carbon materials was studied in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the polycrystalline carbon films used in experiment can not be properly described in the framework of our approach because for this purpose we have to consider a mixture between different crystalline structures .",
    "in fact , the fermi surface of the @xmath147 structure of graphite is found to be much more complex and , in particular , it does not possess the cylindrical symmetry ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in this case , our approach should be markedly modified .",
    "besides , many additional factors like the presence of a diamond - like phase on the surface of samples and the absence of any information about the local electric fields do not allow us to clarify the role of the band structure in this case .",
    "therefore , specific emission experiments with graphite single crystals at different orientations of the electric field would be of evident interest .    this work has been supported by the russian foundation for basic research under grant no .",
