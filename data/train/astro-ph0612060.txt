    "cosmological observations , including type ia supernovae ( sne ia)@xcite , cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb)@xcite , large - scale structures ( lss)@xcite and so on , have provided strong evidence for a spatially flat universe being in a stage of accelerating expansion . in the context of friedmann - robertson - walker cosmology , this acceleration is attributed to a new form of energy with negative pressure , dubbed dark energy ( de ) , whose nature remains a big puzzle . the simplest candidate for de",
    "is the cosmological constant .",
    "however , it suffers from the notorious fine tuning and coincidence problems @xcite .",
    "many dynamical models on de , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , k - essence @xcite and quintom , have been proposed to avoid above difficulties . among them ,",
    "the quintom model allows the equation of state ( eos ) crossing -1 during evolution @xcite .",
    "extensive studies on this model has been carried on both theoretically and phenomenologically @xcite .",
    "different de models predict different global evolutions as well as different structure formations of the universe .",
    "therefore cosmological observations can provide important constraints on the nature of de .",
    "however , degeneracies of cosmological parameters exist in almost all cosmological observations , i.e. , they are sensitive not to single parameters but to some specific combinations of them .",
    "it is therefore highly necessary to combine different probes to break parameter degeneracies so as to achieve tight cosmological constraints .",
    "furthermore , different observations are affected by different systematic errors , and it is thus helpful to reduce potential biases by combining different probes . to perform joint analyzes , global fitting is the most secure study , because it avoids using strong , and sometimes even inappropriate priors obtained from other observations .",
    "observations on sne ia have played important roles in de studies@xcite .",
    "however , due to the difficulties of detecting high - redshift sne ia , such a geometrical measurement is limited .",
    "the future snap / jdem is planed to probe up to redshift around @xmath3 . on the other hand , the 3-year wmap data ( wmap3 ) , which is so far the most precise measurement of the cmb , reveals the information obout our universe at redshift around @xmath4 . in between ,",
    "there have not been many probes accessible to us . in this",
    "regard , grbs are the most promising tracers of the evolution of the universe at redshift around a few to even a few tens because they are the most powerful events in the universe .",
    "the currently operating swift satellite is able to detect about @xmath5 long duration grb events within one year , and we expect that it will open up a potentially new window for grb cosmographic studies . at present , the measured redshifts of grbs have extended to @xmath6@xcite .",
    "even though the physical origin of the long grb is not very clear , many extensive discussions about the relations between the spectral and temporal parameters show the potential for using long grbs as cosmic candles for cosmography .",
    "recently , headway has been made in considering how to make grbs standard candles . in the literature",
    "there are many studies about the intrinsic correlations between temporal or spectral properties of grbs and their isotropic energies and luminositiy , for example , the spectral lag @xmath7 the luminosity correlation ( @xmath8)@xcite , the luminosity @xmath7 variablity correlation ( v-@xmath9)@xcite , the spectral peak energy @xmath7 isotropic energy correlation ( @xmath10-@xmath11)@xcite , the peak spectral energy@xmath7isotropic luminosity correlation ( @xmath10-@xmath9)@xcite and the isotropic luminosity @xmath7 peak energy @xmath7 high signal time scale correlation ( @xmath9-@xmath10-@xmath12)@xcite and so on .",
    "these correlations help grbs nearly to be `` known candles '' @xcite .",
    "shaefer obtained the first grb hubble diagram of 9 grbs with known redshift by using the spectral lag and the variability indicators , and from the grb hubble diagram he constrained @xmath13 within @xmath14 confidence level@xcite .",
    "after that , many investigations have been triggered on using grbs as cosmological probes @xcite .",
    "very recently , shaefer@xcite has constructed a grb hubble diagram with 69 grbs over a redshift range of @xmath15 to @xmath16 , with 39 grbs having redshifts @xmath17 .",
    "it is the largest grb sample so far .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present a more general analysis on the eos of de by including grb data in addition to cmb , lss and sne ia in global fitting .",
    "we mainly consider the dynamical dark energy parameterization for there is no compelling reason to neglect the evolution of dark energy factitiously .",
    "we employ mcmc techniques for the analysis .",
    "the mcmc method is the global fitting on the cosmological parameters and we use the original cmb and lss data rather than use the cmb shift parameter , the linear growth factor or the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measured from the large scale structure survey .",
    "the global fitting is the most secure way for processing data because it is a joint analysis and it can avoid using some strong or even inappropriate priors from others . the effects of dark energy perturbations are carefully taken into account with great attention paid to the perturbations when the equation of state gets across -1 .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in section ii we describe the method and the data ; in section iii we present our results on the determination of cosmological parameters from global fitting ; finally we present our conclusions in section v.",
    "in this section we describe the method used in the fitting process . for the de parametrization , we adopt @xmath18 model , constant @xmath19 and pay particular attention to the commonly used eos of the form@xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scale factor and @xmath22 characterizes the  running \" of the eos .",
    "the evolution of de density is then @xmath23}~.\\ ] ]    for de models whose eos is not equal to @xmath24 , the perturbation inevitably exists .",
    "the perturbation of de has no effect on the geometric constraints of sn ia , however , for the cmb and lss data , the perturbation of de should be considered , because the late time isw effects differ significantly when de perturbation are considered , and the isw effects take an important part on large angular scales of cmb and the matter power spectrum of lss@xcite . for quintessence - like or phantom - like models where @xmath19 does not cross @xmath24 , there are not fundamental difficulties in dealing with perturbations . in parameter",
    "fitting , however , biases may be introduced if we limit our considerations only to quintessence or only to phantom models .",
    "thus it is more natural and consistent to allow @xmath19 crossing @xmath24 in the fitting analysis .",
    "furthermore , there are observational indications that @xmath19 might evolve from @xmath25 in the past to @xmath26 at present , which have stimulated many theoretical studies . for @xmath19 crossing @xmath24 ,",
    "one is encountered with the divergence problem for perturbations at @xmath27 . for handling the parametrization of the eos getting across -1 ,",
    "firstly we introduce a small positive constant @xmath28 to divide the full range of the allowed value of the eos @xmath19 into three parts : 1 ) @xmath29 ; 2 ) @xmath30 ; and 3 ) @xmath31 . working in the conformal newtonian gauge , the perturbations of de can be described by & = & -(1+w)(-3 ) -3(c_s^2-w )  , [ dotdelta ] + & = & -(1 - 3w)- + k^2(+ )   .",
    "[ dottheta ]    neglecting the entropy perturbation , for the regions 1 ) and 3 ) , the eos does not across @xmath24 and the perturbation is well defined by solving eqs.([dotdelta],[dottheta ] ) . for the case 2 ) , the perturbation of energy density @xmath32 and divergence of velocity , @xmath33 , and the derivatives of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are finite and continuous for the realistic quintom de models .",
    "however for the perturbations of the parameterizations , there is clearly a divergence . in our study for such a regime , we match the perturbations in region 2 ) to the regions 1 ) and 3 ) at the boundary and set @xmath34 in our numerical calculations we limit the range to be @xmath35 and find our method to be a very good approximation to the multi - field quintom .",
    "more detailed treatments can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "the publicly available markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) package cosmomc@xcite is employed in our global fitting , and modifications have been made to include de perturbations , and to suit the de models which we study .",
    "we assume purely adiabatic initial conditions and work in the flat universe with @xmath36 .",
    "our most general parameter space is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the baryon and cold dark matter densities relative to the critical density , @xmath40 is the ratio ( multiplied by 100 ) of the sound horizon at decoupling to the angular diameter distance to the last scattering surface , @xmath41 is the optical depth due to re - ionization , @xmath42 and @xmath2 is the parameters of the eos of de , @xmath43 and @xmath44 characterize the power spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations . for the @xmath45 , @xmath46",
    ",    we vary the above parameters and fit to the observational data with the mcmc method . for the pivot of the primordial spectrum we set @xmath47mpc@xmath48 .",
    "the following weak priors are taken : @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "we impose a tophat prior on the cosmic age as 10 gyr @xmath53 20 gyr .",
    "furthermore , we make use of the hst measurement of the hubble parameter @xmath54 by multiplying the likelihood by a gaussian likelihood function centered around @xmath55 with a standard deviation @xmath56@xcite . we also adopt a gaussian prior on the baryonic density @xmath57 ( 1 @xmath58 ) from big bang nucleosynthesis@xcite .    in our calculations , we take the total likelihood to be the products of the separate likelihoods ( @xmath59 ) of cmb , lss , snia and grb . defining @xmath60 , we then have [ chi2 ] ^2_l , total = ^2_l , cmb + ^2_l , lss + ^2_l , snia + ^2_l , grbs   .",
    "if the likelihood function is gaussian , @xmath61 coincides with the usual definition of @xmath62 up to an additive constant corresponding to the logarithm of the normalization factor of @xmath63 . for cmb",
    ", we include the three - year wmap ( wmap3 ) data and compute the likelihood with the routine supplied by the wmap team @xcite . for lss , we use the 3d power spectrum of galaxies from sdss @xcite and from 2dfgrs@xcite . to minimize the nonlinear effects",
    ", we restrict ourselves only to the first 14 bins when using the sdss results@xcite , the range of k is @xmath64 . for sne ia",
    ", we mainly present the results with the recently released `` gold '' set of 182 supernovae published by riess @xmath65 @xmath66 in ref.@xcite .",
    "for the grb data , we have considered the published sample by schaefer@xcite , which includes 69 grb events . upon using these distance modulus , we notice the circulation problem associated with grbs for cosmological probing . due to the lack of the local calibration ,",
    "usually the correlations depend on the cosmological parameters that we attempt to constrain . however , there are results that show the relation does not change dramatically in a wide range of cosmological parameters@xcite . in this paper",
    "we do not adopt the correction for the circulation problem , and we take the distance modulus published by schaefer . in the calculation of the likelihood from sne ia and grbs data , we marginalize over the nuisance parameter@xcite .",
    "for each regular calculation , we run 8 independent chains comprising of @xmath67 chain elements , and spend thousands of cpu hours on a supercomputer .",
    "the average acceptance rate is about @xmath68 .",
    "we test the convergence of the chains by gelman and rubin criteria@xcite and find that @xmath69 is on the order of @xmath70 , which is much more conservative than the recommended value @xmath71 .",

    ", we compare the results between the two cases with or without grbs . from the table",
    ", we can see that the best fit values and the errors change when the grbs data are included , especially on the parameters of the eos of de . for @xmath18 or constant @xmath19 de models ,",
    "the best fit values and the errors change little when considering the grbs data , however , for the dynamical de models , the effects from grbs can be obviously seen .",
    "the best fit value of @xmath75 is @xmath76 for the combined sn ia @xmath77 wmap3 @xmath77 sdss @xmath77 2dfgrs .",
    "when we adopt the grbs data , the best fit value of @xmath75 changed to @xmath78 , and the error bars shrink considerably , especially on @xmath2 which delineate the evolution of de .",
    "one can find that the @xmath79 error bar of @xmath2 changed from @xmath80 to @xmath81 , which is tightened about @xmath82 .",
    "this can be seen in fig 1 graphically .    in figure [ w0-w1 ] ,",
    "we delineate the two dimensional posterior constraint on @xmath83 .",
    "the solid lines and the dashed lines stand for @xmath72 and @xmath79 constraints respectively .",
    "we divide the parameter space into four regions representing different dark energy models by two lines : @xmath84 and @xmath85 . for models located in the upper left region labeled as quintom a , the equation of state of dark energy crosses @xmath24 from upside down , i.e. , @xmath19 is greater than @xmath24 in the past and becomes less than @xmath24 at present .",
    "the evolution of @xmath19 for models of quintom b has an opposite direction . from the plot ,",
    "it is noted that quintom a models are mildly favored by current observational data .",
    "the @xmath18 model continues to be a consistent one at @xmath79 level with and without grbs included .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 represents the evolution of de .",
    "it is known that the cmb data alone can not constrain well the dynamics of de .",
    "lss data are valuable in de studies mostly because they provide a tight limit on @xmath73 , which in turn helps to constrain the properties of de due to the degeneracy between @xmath73 and the eos of de in cosmological observables .",
    "currently the measurements of the luminosity - distance from sne ia at various redshifts give rise to the most direct constraints on the dynamics of de . in a flat universe with the eos of de given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) , the luminosity distance can be written as d_l = c(1+z)^z_0.from this equation , one can see that there are degeneracies between the background parameters @xmath42 , @xmath2 , @xmath73 and @xmath86 . in figure [ degeneracy ] we present the degeneracy by exploring the information of luminorsity distance at different redshifts in the @xmath87 parameter plane .",
    "different colored bands describe the parameter space of @xmath88 where the variation of @xmath89 is in between @xmath90 for @xmath91 ( black ) , @xmath92(red),@xmath93(green ) , @xmath94(blue),@xmath95(cyan),@xmath96(magenta ) and @xmath97(yellow ) .",
    "one can find that the degeneracy between @xmath42 and @xmath2 varies with the redshift , which in turn implicit that combining the information of @xmath89 at different redshifts can help break such a degeneracy .",
    "therefore , in order to constrain the cosmological parameters well , one needs distance determinations for a wide range of redshifts . for current sne ia data ,",
    "the redshift range is limited with the highest observed redshift @xmath98 . on the other hand , for the grb sample used in our analysis",
    ", the redshift extends to as high as @xmath99 with @xmath100 data points having @xmath17 , thus , the complementarity of grbs to sne ia is highly expected .",
    "this plot is the ideal case for showing the degeneracy between the parameters @xmath42 and @xmath2 for different redshift , because we fix the other parameters except @xmath42 and @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , if we vary the other parameters like @xmath73 or @xmath86 , the changing of the degeneracy with redshift will also exist but will not be so obvious as figure [ degeneracy ] , the different colored bands will be much broader than the ones in figure [ degeneracy ] respectively .",
    "figure [ w0-w1 ] is more general results which is obtained from the global fitting where we have all the parameters in equation ( [ parameter ] ) varying .    to demonstrate the degeneracies between different parameters , we show in figure [ triplot ] the two - dimensional correlation contours of @xmath42 , @xmath2 and @xmath73 from our global fitting .",
    "it is seen that , with the grbs data , the constraints on the parameters are tightened to a certain degree , especially for @xmath42 and @xmath2 .",
    "our results show that high - redshift cosmological probes can play roles in the study of the dynamics of dark energy , and thus it is of importance to explore high - redshift cosmological probes .",
    "grbs can bridge up the gap between the relatively nearby sn ia and the much earlier cmb . comparing with sn ia ,",
    "grbs have their own advantages .",
    "they are very powerful and thus can be detected out to very high redshifts .",
    "furthermore , the gamma - ray photons suffer from no dust extinction when they propagate to us .",
    "therefore they deserve detailed studies . although the cosmological applications of grbs are currently limited by the relatively small number of available data and the quality of the data , it is considerably important to investigate their potentials and related problems . with the accumulation of observational data and the advances of theoretical understandings of grb physics , the goal of using grbs as",
    "cosmological candles could be better achieved .",

    ", we find that high - redshift grbs may have effects in constraining the eos of de , especially for the dynamical de models .",

    "the @xmath102cdm model is consistent with the current data within @xmath79 confidence level , with quintom a - like models mildly favored .",
    "grbs are the most powerful astrophysical events in the universe , which hold great potential to reveal the high redshift universe .",
    "even though , the grb data are not as good as sn ia currently , our results indicate the possible potentials of grbs in dark energy studies .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our global fitting method is different from using the cmb shift parameter , the linear growth factor or the bao parameter measured from the lss .",
    "although these parameters carry important information of dark energy , their specific values are usually extracted from observational data under certain conditions . overlooking these conditions",
    "leads to inappropriate use of the values of these parameters , which in turn could result biased constraints on cosmological parameters .",
