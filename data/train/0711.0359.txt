    "indicate that current universe is experiencing an accelerated expansion .",
    "there are different cosmological models which explain this phenomenon by postulating the hypothesis that the universe is filled by fluid which violates the strong energy condition ( so called dark energy ) or by postulating that the friedmann equations do not describe well the evolution of the universe . due to the lack of a satisfactory cosmological model ( while the simplest @xmath0cdm model seems to be the best one we have still some problems with it ) the model - independent reconstruction of the expansion history of the universe and the nature of dark energy seems to be important .",
    "these reconstruction method can be divided into parametric and non - parametric approach @xcite .",
    "here we consider the reconstruction of dynamics in terms of single potential function using the relation between the luminosity distance and the hubble function .",
    "this reconstruction allow us to find the moment of transition from decelerating to accelerating phase of expansion as well as to probe the evolution of the dark energy .",
    "our universe in large scale structure is homogeneous and isotropic , therefore its geometry in a good approximation can be described by the robertson - walker metric . assuming general relativity we can characterize evolution of the universe in terms of only single function - scale factor @xmath1 as a function of cosmic time @xmath2 .",
    "the scale factor obeys the raychaudhuri equation ( also called acceleration equation ) @xmath3 where dot denotes differentiation with respect the cosmological time @xmath2 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 are energy density and pressure of the perfect fluid - source of gravity .",
    "we assume that both @xmath6 and @xmath7 depends on @xmath2 through the scale factor , i.e. @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "then we can simply find first integral of raychaudhuri equation , called as friedmann equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is hubble function , energy density @xmath6 satisfies conservation condition @xmath12 , @xmath13 is curvature constant",
    ".    equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) can be rewritten to the form of a newtonian dynamical system @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the potential function which characterizes a model and dot means here differentiation with respect rescalled time variable @xmath16 : @xmath17 : @xmath18 .    in this interpretation",
    "the friedmann first integral plays the role of energy integral .",
    "for example for the concordance @xmath0cdm model potential function assumes the following form @xmath19 where @xmath20 are density parameters for each fluid @xmath21 defined at the present epoch labelled by @xmath22 index ; @xmath23 for dust matter , @xmath24 for curvature fluid and @xmath25 for the cosmological constant ; @xmath26 in general and @xmath27 is chosen for the value of the scale factor at present .",
    "let us note that in a general case if equation of state is parameterized by the scale factor @xmath28 then all dynamics is characterized in terms of a single potential function of @xmath28 ( or redshift @xmath29 : @xmath30 ) .",
    "of course this function has the general form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is effective energy density parameter for total fluids .",
    "+ since @xmath33 the potential function @xmath34 can be immediately reconstructed from snia data .",
    "such a reconstruction is possible due to a simple relation between @xmath35 and luminosity distance for the flat universe @xmath36 = h(z).\\ ] ] due to the fact that we know @xmath37 for the discrete values of @xmath29 a kind of smoothing procedure is needed to obtain function @xmath34 .",
    "this can be done by approximating the luminosity distance function by some fitting formula .",
    "here we consider different ansatz for @xmath38 function    1 .",

    "+ finally we have chosen this model which is the best one in the light of snia data @xcite in the bayesian framework meaning , i.e. with the greatest value of the posterior probability @xcite . here",
    "we used the bic quantity @xcite as an approximation to the evidence and assumed equal values of prior probabilities for all models .",
    "after such an analysis we conclude that the best parametrization ( model ) is @xmath50 and we have used this one in the later analysis .",
    "result of reconstruction the potential function is presented in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "+    the moment of transition ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 ) is related with the maximum of the potential function so it can be easily found .",
    "results for the reconstructed potential are as follows @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "these outcomes can be compared with the values obtained for the potential of the best fit @xmath0cdm model @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath55 and @xmath59 .",
