    "the roos bound @xcite generalizes this idea by exploiting _",
    "several _ sets of _ nonconsecutive _ elements in the defining set .",
    "the contributions of van lint and wilson  @xcite , duursma and ktter  @xcite and duursma and pellikann  @xcite are further generalizations .",
    "other approaches include the boston bounds  @xcite and the bound by betti and sala  @xcite .    although these improved bounds show that for many codes the actual distance is higher than the bch bound , there is no general decoding algorithm up to any of these bounds .",
    "hartmann and tzeng  @xcite proposed two variants of an iterative decoding algorithm up to the ht bound .",
    "however , these algorithms require the calculation of missing syndromes and the solution of non - linear equations .",
    "an approach for decoding all binary cyclic codes up to their _ actual _ minimum distance of length less than 63 was given by feng and tzeng @xcite .",
    "they use a generalized syndrome matrix and fit the known syndrome coefficients manually for each code into the structure of the matrix .",

    "this allows to formulate a new lower bound on the minimum distance of cyclic codes .",
    "we identify some classes of cyclic codes and refine the bound on their distance .",
    "a wide class of codes , which is covered by our approach , is the class of reversible codes @xcite .",
    "our new lower bound is better than the bch bound and for most codes also better than the ht bound .",
    "moreover , it can be seen as a generalization of some boston  @xcite bounds .",
    "we give tables for binary and ternary cyclic codes , where we count the number of cyclic codes for which our bound is better than the bch bound .    as a second part",
    ", we give an efficient decoding algorithm up to our new bound .",
    "this decoding algorithm is based on a generalized key equation , a modified chien search and a generalized forney s formula  @xcite for the error evaluation .",
    "the time complexity of the whole decoding procedure is quadratic with the length of the cyclic code .",
    "this contribution is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec_preliminaries ] gives some basic definitions and recapitulates known bounds on the minimum distance of cyclic codes .",
    "we show how the bch bound can be represented by a simple rational function . in section  [ sec_principle ] , we explain how we associate a rational function to a cyclic code and we prove our new lower bound on the minimum distance .",
    "section  [ sec_classes ] provides several identified classes and we refine the lower bound of these codes .",
    "we compare our new lower bound on the minimum distance with the bch and the ht bound . in section  [ sec_boston ] , we show how several boston bounds are generalized by our principle .",
