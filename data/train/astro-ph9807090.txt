    "for most purposes , the sun can be assumed in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium , neglecting the effects of rotation and magnetic field .",
    "however models built with these simplifying assumptions do not agree with the helioseismic data , in particular with those obtained by the satellite soho , and it appears that macroscopic mixing processes must be taken into account not only in the convection zone , but also in the radiative interior .",
    "turbulent mixing may be introduced in the models by adding a turbulent term @xmath2 in the diffusive part of the equation for the time evolution of the chemical abundance @xmath3 .",
    "the equation becomes : @xmath4 where the velocity v@xmath5 of species i with respect to the center of mass is : @xmath6 the velocity @xmath7 is the sum of one term which depends on the concentration gradient @xmath8 , and one which does not , @xmath9 ( proffit and michaud 1991 ) . in this section",
    ", we address the mixing which may occur in the shear layer connecting the differential rotation in the convection zone with the solid rotation of the radiative interior .",
    "spiegel and zahn ( 1992 ) have given a physical interpretation of this tachocline by invoking anisotropic turbulence , with much stronger viscous transport in the horizontal than in the vertical direction .",
    "such turbulence reduces the differential rotation and therefore inhibits the spread of the layer deep inside the radiative zone .",
    "the conservation of mass , momentum and entropy is given by : @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the density , @xmath14 the pressure , @xmath15 the temperature , @xmath16 is the local velocity in the rotating frame , @xmath17 the differential rotation , @xmath18 the specific entropy , @xmath19 the viscous stress tensor , @xmath20 gravitational potential . + in order to solve the system of equations , some simplifying assumptions are made :    * the flow field is axisymmetric @xmath21 * anelastic approximation : @xmath22 is negligible * advection is small compared to coriolis acceleration * the tachocline is thin compared to the pressure scale height * viscous forces are small compared to coriolis force .    after separating each variable into its mean value on the sphere plus a perturbation , as @xmath23 ,",
    "the linearized form of the set of equations , in the stationnary state ( @xmath24 ) is ( spiegel and zahn 1992 ) : @xmath25   \\nonumber \\\\ \\mbox {   diffusion and advection of angular momentum } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the final step is to connect the meridional velocity to the differential rotation . approximating the stream function by @xmath34 and using the conservation of angular momentum ,",
    "we get : @xmath35 with @xmath36 . by introducing the variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 the tachocline thickness , where @xmath39 is the radius , n the brunt - visl frequency and @xmath40 the radiative diffusivity at the base of the convective zone , we thus obtain this radial dependancy for @xmath41 : @xmath42 the anisotropic diffusion invoked to stop the spread of the tachocline will also interfer with the advective transport of chemicals .",
    "chaboyer and zahn ( 1992 ) have shown that the result is a diffusive transport in the vertical direction , with an effective diffusivity given by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the coefficients of the expansion of the vertical component of the velocity @xmath45 in legendre polynomials .",

    "when allowing for turbulent diffusion in the tachocline , the settling of helium is reduced by 16% for @xmath57 up to 25% with @xmath60 , leading to surface abundances @xmath76 or @xmath77 which are in better agreement with the helioseismic value .",

( 8,5 )    ( 8,5 )    we remark that the present z / x value for a mixed model plays an important role in this study . if we do not calibrate the z / x value of the mixed model , starting with the heavy element composition @xmath78 of the reference model , we obtain different surface abundances ( see for example column 2 and 3 of table 1 for the coeficient @xmath57 ) . also , when comparing the two sound speed profiles ( figs . 4 and 5 ) , we see that in both cases the bump around 0.7 @xmath50 is pratically erased by the introduction of the tachocline mixing , but the calibrated model is modified along the whole structure and not only close to the bump .",
    "this could be understood by the fact that the tachocline mixing inhibits the elements settling and then less helium reaches the center , modifying the central conditions .",
    "the remaining part of the discrepancy between the nuclear core and the convection zone may come from uncertainties on opacities coefficients or knwoledge of the element abundances ( see brun , turck - chize and morel 1998 ) or from some other mixing .",
    "the low value of the tachocline thickness ( @xmath79 ) inferred by elliot et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) could be due to the turbulent coefficient used and also to the fact that they did not calibrate their model in z / x .",
    "( 8,4.8 )    ( 8,4.8 )",
    "we also introduce a turbulent pressure in the total pressure ( i.e. @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the sum of the gas+radiation+coulombian pressure ) .",
    "the turbulent pressure is neglected in most solar models , in spite of the fact that it represents a substantial fraction of the total pressure in the uppermost part of the convection zone , which has an important weight in the determination of the frequency of the acoustic modes . by definition , the turbulent pressure is given by the horizontal average @xmath82 , @xmath83 being the vertical turbulent velocity , but here we link it to the convective velocity @xmath84 drawn from the mixing lenth treatment ( mlt ) : @xmath85 , where @xmath86 takes into account the geometry of the turbulent motions .",
    "we follow cox and giuli ( 1968 ) who introduce a modified adiabatic gradient .",
    "@xmath87 where @xmath88 is the adiabatic temperature gradient .",
    "doing so we obtain for the convective efficiency @xmath89 and for the velocity @xmath90 a corrected expression : @xmath91 where , @xmath92 is the temperature gradient of the medium , @xmath93 is the temperature gradient of the moving element , @xmath94 is the mixing length , @xmath95 the pressure scale height , g the gravitational acceleration and @xmath96 . after some algebraic manipulations ,",

    "the real gradient @xmath92 is thus obtained by : @xmath103    we test different values for @xmath86 from 0.5 to 1.5 ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , and find that the best agreement with direct numerical simulations ( see rosenthal et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) ) are obtained for @xmath104 ( see fig .",
    "6 ) . for the other values ,",
    "the turbulent contribution to the total pressure is either too low ( @xmath105 ) or too high ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "this study confirms the important role played by the turbulent pressure in the upper layers of the solar convection zone ( see baturin and mironova and bhmer and rdiger these proceedings ) .",
    "its introduction in the model removes a large part of the discrepancy between observed and predicted acoustic frequencies , as shown in fig .",
    "again the best fit is obtained with @xmath104 . but this improvement can not hide the fundamental shortcomings of the mixing length treatment , in particular that of being a local theory which does not allow for convective penetration .",
