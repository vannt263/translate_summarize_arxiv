    "diversity techniques have been developed in order to combat fading on wireless channels .",
    "recently , a new diversity technique has been proposed with cooperative systems  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "different nodes in the network cooperate in order to form a mimo system array and exploit space - time diversity .",
    "cooperation protocols have been classified in three main families : amplify - and - forward  ( af ) , decode - and - forward  ( df ) , and compress - and - forward  ( cf ) .",
    "df protocols require more processing than af ones , as the signals have to be decoded at relay before being forwarded . however , if signals are correctly decoded at relays , performance are better than those of af protocols , as noise is deleted",
    ".    moreover , in this paper , our work is motivated by the potential advantages of df protocols over af protocols in some scenarios .",
    "for example , it has been proven in  @xcite that in a multihop context it is necessary to use a df protocol at some relays to regenerate the signals .",
    "indeed a full af strategy would add more noise at each hop , which makes signals no longer decodable .",
    "there are few proposed df protocols in literature .",
    "they usually do not succeed to bring both full diversity and full symbol rate .",
    "the ltw df ( named by its authors laneman , tse and wornell @xcite ) has a full diversity order but a rate of @xmath0 symbol per channel use ( symb .",
    "the nbk df ( named by its authors nabar , bolcskei and kneubuhler @xcite ) has a rate of 1 symb .",
    "pcu but no diversity .",
    "indeed , as signals have to be fully decoded at relays , the first phase of the transmission needs 1 channel use for each information symbol .",
    "two different cases can be implemented in the second phase : either the source sends new symbols to have a rate of 1 symb .",
    "pcu , but diversity is lost ( these new symbols not being relayed ) ; or the source sends the same symbols or a combination of them to have diversity , but the rate drops . the only proposed solution to this problem is the dynamic df ( ddf ) protocol @xcite which succeeds to bring both full diversity and a rate of 1 symb .",
    "however its implementation is quite complex and an usable ddf was not proposed .    to define a df protocol with both full rate and full diversity",
    ", we suggest to introduce distributed space - time block codes ( stbc ) in the same way they have been successfully used in af strategies , and in particular with the non - orthogonal af ( naf ) @xcite , as well as in the alamouti df protocol @xcite .",
    "we first present a df protocol with asymmetric sending and relaying phases .",
    "it brings full diversity , but the rate is only @xmath1 symb .",
    "pcu . to solve this problem of low symbol rate",
    ", we define an incomplete df based on an incomplete decoding at the relays .",
    "this protocol brings both full rate and full diversity .",
    "outage probabilities calculations and simulation results have been conducted to validate these approaches and to prove that incomplete df has better performance than any existing df protocol and than the naf using the same stbc .",
    "moreover a theoretical study shows that the incomplete df has the same diversity - multiplexing gain tradeoff ( dmt ) than the naf .",
    "we consider a wireless network with @xmath2 sources and one destination . as the channel",
    "is shared in a tdma manner , each user is allocated a different time slot , and the system can be reduced to a relay channel with one source , @xmath3 relays and one destination .",
    "the @xmath2 sources will play the role of the source in succession , while the others will be used as relays .",
    "the channel links are assumed to be rayleigh distributed and slow fading , so their coefficients can be considered as constant during the transmission of at least one frame .",
    "besides , we suppose a symmetric scenario , i.e. all the channel links are subject to the same average signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .    as this",
    "work focuses on the protocol , for simplicity , a uniform energy distribution is assumed .",
    "considered terminals are half - duplex ; they can not receive and transmit at the same time .",

    "a selection based on the source - relay links quality was made @xcite .",

    "as @xmath170 is a rotation matrix , a simple multiplication by @xmath11 allows to obtain @xmath171 and @xmath172 from @xmath101 and @xmath164 .    in order to take advantage of this property",
    ", the idea is that the source sends the first and third lines of the codeword matrix during the first phase of the transmission and the second and fourth lines during the second phase of the transmission .    the partial decoding at relays",
    "is then done in two steps .",
    "first we compute the matrix product @xmath173 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\mathbf{m}^\\dagger \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } \\frac{y^{r_k}_1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}h_1 } \\\\ \\frac{y^{r_k}_6}{\\sqrt{\\rho}h_1 } \\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] then we decode elements @xmath171 and @xmath172 of the ring of integers of @xmath169 in an exhaustive way as in the example of the subsection [ sect_ex_golden ] .",
    "finally @xmath101 and its conjugate @xmath164 can be easily deduced from equation ( [ eq : method2 ] ) .",
    "this second method allows to decrease considerably the complexity .",
    "indeed , the exhaustive search is now performed in a constellation of @xmath114 elements instead of @xmath163 , which is quite reasonable .",
    "this second decoding method can not be applied to @xmath139 perfect codes whose structure do not have the same property .",
    "that is why we have chosen to use tast code .",
    "the advantages of the diophantine approximation and this two - step decoding method could be combined .",
    "ideally the incomplete df would be the least complex if used with a distributed stbc offering both a structure allowing the two - step decoding and @xmath174 for a simple diophantine approximation .",
    "simulations have also been run for the two - relay cooperative scheme with a @xmath139 tast code and the two - step decoding at the relays .",
    "one can see on figure [ wer_2relais ] that tast codes provide slightly worse performance than perfect codes .",
    "this is explained by the fact that perfect codes are nvd ( non - vanishing - determinant ) , on the contrary of tast codes .",
    "however , when we use two or more relays , the partial decoding of the information at relays induces more complexity , as the two - step decoding method described in subsection [ sect_ex_tast44 ] can not be used .",
    "that is why the use of two - step decodable stbc such as the tast codes is necessary .",
    "in this paper , we define a new df protocol using distributed space - time codes that provides both full diversity and full rate , as the best known af protocols , and unlike the existing ltw and nbk df protocols .",
    "this new protocol is based on an incomplete decoding of the signal at the relays .",
    "the received signals at relays are decoded as elements of the ring of integers of the considered number field without decoding the information symbols .",
    "several decoding methods are proposed at relays : exhaustive search , diophantine approximation or a method based on the decoding decomposition in two steps according to the code structure .",
    "the two last methods allow a considerable decrease of complexity .",
    "the diversity - multiplexing gain tradeoff is proved to be the same as the one of the naf protocol which is the best known af protocol . besides outage probability and simulation results prove that the incomplete df gives slightly better performance than the naf protocol in the high snr regime , and selection provides an improvement for low snr .    in this study , we have only considered cooperative schemes with line - of - sight , but the use of df protocols can be very important in a non - line - of - sight or multihop cooperative scheme . to highlight the advantages of this new df protocol over an af strategy , applications of the incomplete df to a multihop system will be investigated in future works .",
    "two cases have to be distinguished : with or without cooperation .",
    "when @xmath175 source - relay links are not in outage ( @xmath84 relays are in outage ) , the incomplete df cooperation scheme with @xmath50 relays is used .      as the outage events of the source - relay links are independent , the probability of having only the last @xmath84 relays in outage , is the product of the probabilities of each @xmath50 first source - relay links not being in outage , and each of the last @xmath84 source - relay links being in outage .",
    "these probabilities are given by expression ( [ outage_event ] ) .",
    "so the outage probability of the last @xmath84 relays only can be written @xmath178                          the outage probability of the incomplete df is given in equation  ( [ eq : pout ] ) . in order to compute the dmt of this cooperative strategy",
    ", we have to study the asymptotic behavior of this expression when @xmath44 grows to infinity .",
