    "the metallicities were estimated by fitting all observable strong emission lines and deriving a metallicity likelihood distribution for each galaxy based on theoretical model fits calculated using a combination of stellar population synthesis and photoionization models .",
    "these models were then used with z - band luminosities to form mass estimates .    the physical driver for the m - z relationship is still debated .",
    "many studies favor supernova driven winds for the inability of a low - mass galaxy to retain its newly synthesized heavy elements , resulting in a lower effective yield with decreasing mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "other observational and theoretical studies are critical of this theory . for example",

    "thus , a better understanding of the mass - metallicity relationship remains important .",

    "p08 favored isolated or undisturbed systems with relatively low gas mass fractions nearing the end of their star formation activity as an explanation for the unexpectedly high oxygen abundances .",
    "other possible causes for the high abundance outliers were considered and ruled out , such as discrepantly low luminosities for their masses or inaccurate metallicity calculations .",
    "nebular oxygen abundances derived from the observations of strong emission lines and in the absence of direct measurements of the electron temperature are always subject to systematic effects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "emission line strengths were measured for both the mmt and sdss spectra using standard methods available within iraf . in particular , the splot routine was used to analyze the extracted one - dimensional spectra and fit gaussian profiles to emission lines to determine their integrated fluxes .",
    "the h@xmath27 and the adjacent [ ] lines were fitted simultaneously for an accurate deblending .",
    "special attention was paid to the balmer lines , which are located in troughs of significant underlying stellar absorption .",
    "although the equivalent widths of the h@xmath27 emission lines were large enough that the underlying absorption was not a concern , this was not the case for h@xmath26 and the bluer balmer lines .",
    "we experimented with several different methods to correct the measurement of the h@xmath26 emission flux for the effects of underlying absorption . at one extreme , maximizing the h@xmath26 line intensity ( by overestimating the underlying absorption ) leads to a minimum h@xmath27/h@xmath26 value and a minimum estimate of the reddening .",
    "because the underlying absorption is much broader than the emission and these features are both well resolved and relatively high signal - to - noise , the subtraction of the underlying absorption represents only a small contribution to the uncertainty in the reddening corrections ( see table  [ tbl:2 ] ) .    for our final analysis of the balmer emission lines",

    "the emission line fluxes are reported relative to h@xmath26 in table  [ tbl:2 ] , and represent the multiple component fits for the h@xmath26 and h@xmath39 emission lines and the single or deblended gaussian profile fits from splot for the rest of the emission lines .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the errors of the flux measurements were approximated using @xmath40 where n is the number of pixels spanning the gaussian profile fit to the narrow emission lines ( typically 11 ) .",
    "the rms noise in the continuum was taken to be the average of the rms on each side of an emission line .",
    "this error approximation is valid for weak lines whose uncertainty is dominated by error from the continuum subtraction . for cases where the flux measurements were much stronger than the rms noise of the continuum , the error is dominated by flux calibration and de - reddening uncertainty .",
    "this is true for several lines in both the sdss and mmt spectra of sdss-022628 , and for all the h@xmath27 lines ( where a minimum uncertainty of 2% was assumed ) .",
    "flux line strengths relative to h@xmath26 and corresponding errors are listed in table [ tbl:2 ] . as we were not able to detect [ ] @xmath174363 and @xmath174686 at the level of more than 3 @xmath28 in any of the spectra",
    ", a flux upper limit was estimated using equation  [ eq : uncertainty ] .",
    "we calculated upper limits on the electron temperatures based on these @xmath174363 fluxes , but none provided significant constraints for abundance calculations . in some cases , the h@xmath27/h@xmath26 ratios for the sdss and mmt spectra are significantly different .",
    "using the mmt data for our reference ratio , the average percentage difference between the sdss and mmt h@xmath27/h@xmath26 ratio is 15% , whereas the average [ ] @xmath175007/h@xmath26 percentage difference is 16% . since the [ ] /h@xmath26 ratio is less sensitive to flux calibrations , these differences between the two data sets are likely due to using long - slit ( mmt spectra ) versus circular fiber apertures ( sdss spectra ) .",
    "the wide range of observed wavelengths require fluxes to be corrected for extinction and reddening .",
    "since the relative intensities of the balmer lines are nearly independent of both density and temperature , they can be used to solve for the reddening . assuming standard region characteristics ( t@xmath41 k and n@xmath42 @xmath43 ) , both the mmt and sdss spectra were de - reddened using a balmer decrement of 2.82 @xcite and the @xcite reddening law ( with a@xmath44 ) .",
    "the extinction , @xmath45 , from the @xcite law was calculated using the york extinction solver @xcite . with these values",
    "we then derived the reddening value , @xmath46 , using @xmath47 ,      \\label{eq : dered}\\ ] ] where f(h@xmath27)/f(h@xmath26 ) is the observed flux ratio and i(h@xmath27)/i(h@xmath26 ) is the de - reddened line intensity ratio using case b from @xcite .",
    "following @xcite the reddening value can be converted to the logarithmic extinction at @xmath48 as @xmath49 original and de - reddened flux values for both the mmt and sdss data are given in table  [ tbl:2 ] , where errors were propagated from those associated with the individual line measurements .",
    "all of the h@xmath27/h@xmath26 ratios are larger than 2.82 , indicative of significant extinction and reddening due to dust",
    ". since the galactic latitudes for the four galaxies are all large ( ranging from @xmath50 to @xmath51 ) , little foreground extinction from galactic dust is expected , and , indeed , the calculated values of @xmath46 ( see table  [ tbl:2 ] ) are substantially greater than the foreground extinction determined by @xcite .",

    "[ sec : r23 ] , three of our four objects lie well below the mean excitation for a given r@xmath18 value .",
    "figure  [ fig:9 ] also shows an upper limit of log(r@xmath18 ) naturally falls near 1.0 , where the present sample lies within the turn - around region defined by @xmath95 log(r@xmath96 , corresponding to 7.9 @xmath6 12 + log(o / h ) @xmath6 8.3 .",

    "even after recalibration , there is still a significant amount of scatter in these relationships .",
    "we speculate that taking into consideration the additional concern of low excitation would move these points further in the direction of concordance with expectations .",
    "although it appears that the  very low mass \" , high oxygen abundance galaxies from p08 may not be true outliers from the m - z relation , understanding how these galaxies produced spectra that lie far from the median relationships defined by the sdss galaxies in various diagnostic diagrams remains an interesting question .",

    "all three characteristics can be explained by a previous , but recent burst of star formation .",
    "essentially , these properties are all expected @xmath5 5 myr or longer after a starburst characterized as a `` wolf - rayet galaxy . ''",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the presence of strong w - r features in the spectrum of a star forming region are indicative of an intense episode of star formation lasting a relatively short ( on the order of 10@xmath98 years ) duration .",
    "for an instantaneous starburst , these w - r stars appear and disappear during the interval of 3 to 6 myr @xcite .",

    "the mpa - jhu estimates of the balmer absorption are consistent with region ages greater than 4 myr ( 3.4  ) , while our estimates ( larger due to aperture differences ) , suggest a lower limit of 7 myr ( 5.8  ) . finally , during the w - r stage",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , producing inflated n / o ratios such as is seen in the four mmt spectra .      since all four of our objects , which were picked at random ,",
    "have roughly identical spectral characteristics , we assume that the majority of the  very low mass \" sample of p08 are probably similar .",

    "similar to the four galaxies in our sample , the p08  main \" sample data suggest that they have also experienced recent n enrichment . since high",
    "n / o values tend to bias strong line methods towards high abundances , and the metallicity offsets for the  main \" sample are smaller than for the  very low mass \" sample , this bias could easily account for most of this deviation .",
    "all objects of the p08 parent sample display the characteristic nitrogen enhancement expected for a galaxy after passing through the  wolf - rayet galaxy \" phase .",
    "p08 suggest that these objects are  transitional objects running out of fuel \" : i.e. , the high metallicity results because there is only a small amount of ism to enrich .",
    "our overall conclusion is that the high - metallicity outliers are special , not due to unusually high oxygen abundances for their mass or rate of star formation , but , rather , due to an enrichment of nitrogen relative to oxygen .",
    "this nitrogen enrichment may be due to being observed during a rare and short lived evolutionary phase .",
    "we have investigated four of the 41 luminosity - metallicity outliers from the low - mass , high oxygen galaxy sample reported by @xcite . from new spectral observations taken at the mmt that include the [ ] @xmath173727 line , three of four galaxies were found to have relatively low excitation ( low @xmath175007/@xmath173727 ratios ; log(o@xmath72 ) and , more importantly , all four exhibited high n / o values .",
    "each of these characteristics can lead to overestimates of the oxygen abundance if standard strong line calibrations are used ; furthermore , these two characteristics combined can produce the significant metallicity deviations seen for the p08 sample . by comparing our four spectra to the photoionization models of @xcite ( which include the effects of aging of the exciting stars ) , and the empirical calibrations of pmc09 ( which correct for variations in the n / o ratio ) , we found that significantly lower oxygen abundances are favored .",
    "the @xcite oxygen abundances are in line with those expected from the luminosities and stellar masses of the galaxies , while the pmc09 estimates shift oxygen abundances in the right direction . while the  very low mass \" sample displays low star formation rates , the normal star formation within the  main \" sample rules out exhaustive star formation as the variable responsible for the unusual sample spectra . with these conclusions",

    "<S> we present new mmt spectroscopic observations of four dwarf galaxies representative of a larger sample observed by the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and identified by @xcite as low - mass , high oxygen abundance outliers from the mass - metallicity relation . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite showed that these four objects ( with metallicity estimates of @xmath0 ) have oxygen abundance offsets of 0.4 - 0.6 dex from the m@xmath1 luminosity - metallicity relation . </S>",
    "<S> our new observations extend the wavelength coverage to include the [ ] @xmath23726,3729 doublet , which adds leverage in oxygen abundance estimates and allows measurements of n / o ratios . </S>",
    "<S> all four spectra are low excitation , with relatively high n / o ratios ( @xmath3 ) , each of which tend to bias estimates based on strong emission lines toward high oxygen abundances . </S>",
    "<S> these spectra all fall in a regime where the `` standard '' strong line methods for metallicity determinations are not well calibrated either empirically or by photoionization modeling . by comparing our spectra directly to photoionization models , we estimate oxygen abundances in the range of @xmath4 , consistent with the scatter of the mass - metallicity relation . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the physical nature of these galaxies that leads to their unusual spectra ( and previous classification as outliers ) , finding their low excitation , elevated n / o , and strong balmer absorption are consistent with the properties expected from galaxies evolving past the `` wolf - rayet galaxy '' phase . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results to the  main \" sample of @xcite and conclude that they are outliers primarily due to enrichment of nitrogen relative to oxygen , and not due to unusually high oxygen abundances for their masses or luminosities . </S>"
