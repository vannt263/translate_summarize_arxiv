    "effective degrees of freedom to describe a strongly interacting system of hadrons have been one of the key issues in understanding the non - perturbative nature of qcd in the low energy regime . within an impressive array of effective theories available nowadays ,",
    "the constituent quark model has been quite useful in providing a good physical picture of hadrons just like the atomic model for the system of atoms .",
    "absorbing the complicated sea quark pairs and gluonic interactions into the masses of constituent quarks and effective interactions in the hamiltonian , one can make the problem much simpler yet still keep some key features of the underlying qcd to provide useful predictions @xcite .",
    "the commonly used valence constituent quark models truncate the fock space to the lowest sector and simplify the whole system to a bound state of dressed valence quark / antiquark constituents with qcd inspired effective potentials .",
    "although a clear link between the qcd and this type of constituent quark models is still pending , the justification of effective potentials are usually provided by the flux tube configurations generated by the gluon fields as well as the one - gluon - exchange calculation in qcd @xcite .",
    "in addition , relativistic effects play an important role in describing the low - lying hadrons made of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 quarks and antiquarks .",
    "thus , a proper way of dealing with the relativistic aspect of the hadron system is also quite essential .",
    "the formulation of light - front dynamics(lfd )  @xcite , or the front form dynamics introduced by dirac  @xcite , provides a natural framework to include the relativistic effects which are crucial in describing the low - lying mesons .",
    "the simple vacuum except the zero - mode in lfd is a remarkable feature and facilitates an effective description of hadrons in a fock space . in this formalism , each hadron is characterized by a set of fock state wave functions , i.e. the probability amplitudes for finding different combinations of bare quarks and gluons in the hadron at a given lf time @xmath5 .",
    "moreover , the lf wave function is independent of all reference frames related by the front - form boosts because the longitudinal boost operator as well as the lf transverse boost operators are all kinematical .",
    "this is clearly an advantageous feature unique to lfd , which makes the calculation of observables such as form factors much more effective than any other forms of relativistic dynamics .",
    "taking advantage of the lfd , we have developed  @xcite a light - front quark model ( lfqm ) based on a simple qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian for a description of mesons . the key idea of our lfqm was to treat the radial wave function as a trial function for the variational principle to the qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian with the well - known linear plus coulomb interaction .",
    "both the masses and the hadronic properties of ground state pseudoscalar and vector mesons in our lfqm were fairly well reproduced by taking just a 1@xmath6-state harmonic oscillator ( ho ) wave function as a trial function .",
    "computing the meson mass spectra  @xcite , however , we have treated the hyperfine interaction as a perturbation rather than including it in the variation procedure to avoid the negative infinity from the dirac delta function contained in the hyperfine interaction .",
    "this treatment , however , left a room for any further development in handling the hyperfine interaction in our lfqm since the justification of using the perturbation was too technical to be backed up by the first principle , although our numerical results were quite comparable with the available experimental data not only for the meson mass spectra but also for the meson wave function related observables such as the decay constants , form factors , etc .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to update our previous model  @xcite by including the hyperfine interaction also in our variational method to get the optimal model parameters , and examine if it improves our numerical results compared to the ones obtained by the perturbative treatment of the hyperfine interaction .",
    "to achieve this goal , we smeared out the dirac delta function by a gaussian distribution in order to resolve the infinity problem when variational principle is applied .",
    "moreover , we improved our trial wave function by taking a larger ho basis to analyze this effect of improving trial wave functions on our numerical results . to examine our updated model prediction",
    ", we calculate both the meson mass spectra and the meson decay constants .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : modeldescription ] , we describe our qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian with the smeared - out hyperfine interaction . using two different radial wave functions , i.e. the ground state ho wave function and the mixture of the two lowest order ho states , as trial wave functions of the variational principle , we find the analytic formulae of the mass eigenvalues for the ground state pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "the optimum values of model parameters are also presented in this section . in sec .",
    "[ sec : resultsanddiscussion ] , we present our numerical results of the mass spectra obtained from both trial wave functions and compare them with the experimental data as well as our previous calculations  @xcite . to test our trial wave functions with the parameters obtained from the variational principle , we also calculate the meson decay constants and compare them with the experimental data as well as other available theoretical predictions .",
    "we show an improvement of our numerical results by taking a larger ho basis in the trial wave function over the case of taking just the ground state ho wave function as the trial wave function .",
    "summary and conclusion follow in sec .",
    "[ sec : summaryandconclusion ] .",
    "the detailed procedure of fixing our parameters through variational principle is presented in the appendix  [ sec : appendixfixingparameters ] .",
    "in our lfqm for mesons , we approximate the system as effectively dressed valence quarks governed by the following qcd - motivated effective hamiltonian in which motion of the quarks inside a meson is relativistic  @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the relativistic three - momentum of the constituent quarks in the rest frame of the meson . to describe the interaction between quark and antiquark , we use the linear confining potential @xmath9 plus the one - gluon exchange potential @xmath10 . for @xmath6-wave",
    "pseudoscalar and vector mesons , the one - gluon exchange potential reduces to the coulomb potential @xmath11 plus the hyperfine interaction @xmath12 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath13 where @xmath14 for the vector ( pseudoscalar ) meson and @xmath15 .",
    "the lf wave function of the ground state mesons is given by @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the radial wave function and @xmath18 is the interaction - independent spin - orbit wave function .",
    "the wave function is represented by the lorentz invariant internal variables @xmath19 and helicity @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the momentum of the meson with mass @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the momenta of constituent quarks .",
    "the spin - orbit wave functions for pseudoscalar and vector mesons are given by  @xcite @xmath24        \\nu_{\\lambda_{\\bar{q}}}(p_{\\bar{q}})}{\\sqrt{2 } \\tilde{m}_{0 } } ,    \\end{split}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the polarization vector of the vector meson and @xmath26 .",
    "the boost invariant meson mass squared @xmath27 obtained from the free energies of the constituents is given by @xmath28 the spin - orbit wave functions satisfy the relation @xmath29 for both pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "so the computation on this part of the wavefunction is rather trivial in our approach .",
    "we will thus mainly focus on the radial wave functions in the following .    to use a variational principle , we take our trial wave function as an expansion of the true wave function in the ho basis .",
    "we use the same trial wave function @xmath30 for both pseudoscalar and vector mesons , but we try two different forms : one simply takes the form of the @xmath31-state ho wave function given by    [ eqn : wavefunction ] @xmath32    where @xmath33 gives the fraction of @xmath31 wave function and @xmath34    for convenience , we will call eq .

    "once the model parameters are fixed by minimizing the expectation value @xmath48 , then the mass eigenvalue of each meson is obtained as @xmath49 .",
    "the hyperfine interaction @xmath50 in cj model , which contains a dirac delta function , was treated as perturbation to the hamiltonian and was left out in the variational process that optimizes the model parameters .",
    "the main reason for doing this was to avoid the negative infinity generated by the delta function as was pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "specifically , @xmath51 for pseudoscalar mesons decreases faster than other terms that increase as @xmath37 increases .",

    "in this work , we updated our lfqm by smearing out the dirac delta function in the hyperfine interaction and including the smeared hyperfine interaction in our calculation based on the variational principle rather than using the perturbation method to handle the delta function in the contact hyperfine interaction . using the two trial wave functions , i.e. the @xmath31 state ho wave function @xmath35 and the mixed wave function @xmath36 of @xmath31 and @xmath59 ho states , we calculated both the mass spectra of the ground state pseudoscalar and vector mesons and the decay constants of the corresponding mesons .",
    "we found that our predictions of the meson mass spectra are in good agreement with the data both for @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which seems to suggest that for the energy eigenvalues , a simple trial wave function like @xmath35 may suffice .",
    "however , the mixed wave function @xmath36 of @xmath31 and @xmath59 states turns out to be much better in the calculation of decay constants as the wave function @xmath35 generates results that are noticeably higher . according to the variational principle , the results from @xmath36 are obviously closer to the true results compare to the results from @xmath35 .",
    "this improvement is especially evident for the light mesons ( @xmath60 ) where the decay constants are very well known .",
    "the fact that by including one more higher order ho basis in the wave function can improve the results for the decay constants significantly is quite encouraging . since the more realistic wave function for our modified hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : h ] ) can in principle be written in a complete ho basis , i.e. @xmath61 , the improvement obtained by @xmath62 is consistant with our expectation .",
    "nonetheless , we should point out that , strictly speaking , we are not comparing trial wave functions for exactly the same hamiltonian here , since we not only varied the parameters in our wave functions , but also adjusted the parameters in the hamiltonian , such as the masses of quarks and the smearing parameter for best fitting of the mass spectra , as can be seen in table  [ tab : quarkmass ] .",
    "this makes the hamiltonian we used for @xmath35 and @xmath36 slightly different .",
    "however , the parameters in the hamiltonian are kept within a limited range and thus one can still anticipate that a more sophisticated trial wave function should produce better predictions from the same form of hamiltonian .",
    "our calculation seems to suggest that our modification of the hamiltonian by smearing out the hyperfine interaction contributes to an improvement in the right direction .",
    "since our modified hamiltonian together with the improved trial wave function provides very good results as discussed in this work , it may be also desirable to investigate further and see if we can improve our previous calculations of other wave function related observables such as form factors .",

    "notice that the @xmath37 values here are not only different for different quark combinations , but also different for pseudoscalar and vector mesons of the same quark combination .",
    "the reason for this is that the hyperfine interaction we included in our parameterization process gives different contributions to the masses of pseudoscalar and vector mesons and thus induces different parameterizations under variational principle .",
    "we now illustrate our procedure for fixing these parameters .",
