    "in 1985 , kahane laid the foundations of gaussian multiplicative chaos theory ( gmc , hereafter ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "gmc is a theory which defines rigorously random measures with the following formal definition @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a radon measure on some metric space @xmath2 ( equipped with a metric @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 is a parameter and @xmath5 is a centered gaussian field .",
    "the definition should be seen as formal since in the interesting cases the variable @xmath6 does not live in the space of functions on @xmath2 but rather in a space of distributions in the sense of schwartz . in that case , @xmath7 does not make sense pointwise .",
    "of course , we could make the change of variables @xmath8 and absorb the dependence in @xmath9 in the field @xmath6 but we will not do so for reasons which will become clear in the sequel .",
    "in fact , kahane s gmc theory is quite general and the metric space @xmath2 need not be some subspace of @xmath10 ; however , motivated by the study of 2d liouville quantum gravity ( lqg , hereafter ) , we will consider in the sequel the very important subcase where @xmath2 is some subdomain of @xmath10 , @xmath1 is a radon measure on @xmath2 and @xmath6 has a covariance kernel of log - type , namely @xmath11=\\ln_+\\frac{1}{|x - y|}+g(x , y)\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 is a bounded function over @xmath14 . in that case",
    ", one can show that @xmath6 lives in the space of distributions : this just means that for all smooth function @xmath15 with compact support the integral @xmath16 makes sense .",
    "in fact , even if we will not discuss this here , gmc measures associated to log - correlated @xmath6 , namely with covariance , appear in many other fields among which : mathematical finance ( see @xcite for a review ) , 3d turbulence @xcite , decaying burgers turbulence @xcite , the extremes of log - correlated gaussian fields @xcite , the glassy phase of disordered systems @xcite or the eigenvalues of haar distributed random matrices @xcite .",
    "however , we will focus in these notes on applications to lqg .",
    "the purpose of these les houches lecture notes is twofold : first , give a rigorous definition of measures of the type and review some of their main properties .",
    "emphasis will be put on explaining the main ideas and not on giving rigorous proofs .",
    "second , we will show how to use these measures to define polyakov s 1981 theory of lqg @xcite on the riemann sphere ; in this specific case , one can identify lqg with liouville quantum field theory ( lqft , hereafter ) . here , emphasis will be put on explaining the construction of the so - called liouville measures and explaining their ( conjectured ) relation with random planar maps : the construction will rely on the previous section on gmc .",
    "we will denote by @xmath17 the standard euclidean metric , i.e. @xmath18 will denote the distance between two points @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",

    "the eucliden ball of center @xmath19 and radius @xmath23 will be denoted @xmath24 .",
    "the standard lebesgue measure will be @xmath25 in section 2 ; however , in section 3 on lqg , we will work exclusively in @xmath26 so the lebesgue measure will be denoted @xmath27 .    in these lecture notes",
    ", we will only study the theory of gmc in the case where @xmath2 is some subdomain of @xmath10 , @xmath1 is a radon measure of the form @xmath28 with @xmath25 the lebesgue measure , @xmath29 a nonnegative @xmath30 function and @xmath6 has a covariance kernel of log - type .",
    "the underlying probability space will be @xmath31 and we will denote @xmath32 $ ] the associated expectation .",
    "the vector space of @xmath33 integrable random variables with @xmath34 will be denoted @xmath35 .",
    "we will call a function @xmath36 a smooth mollifier if @xmath37 is @xmath38 with compact support and such that @xmath39 .",
    "we will use @xmath37 to regularize the field @xmath6 by convolution ; we will denote by @xmath40 the convolution between two distributions @xmath29 and @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath37 is smooth , the convolution @xmath41 is in fact @xmath38 and in particular the exponential of @xmath41 is well defined .    in section 2 , we will also consider centered gaussian fields @xmath42 with continuous covariances kernels and which are almost surely continuous .      we would like to thank d. chelkak for useful discussions on the ising model and c. hongler , f. david for the images .",
    "we also thank y. huang for reading carefully a prior draft of these lecture notes .",
    "before explaining the construction of the gmc measures , we first give a few reminders on gaussian vectors and processes .      here , we recall basic properties of gaussian vectors and processes that we will need in these lecture notes . the first one is the girsanov transform :    * girsanov theorem * [ th : girsanov ]    let @xmath43 be a smooth centered gaussian field with covariance kernel @xmath44 and @xmath45 some gaussian variable which belongs to the @xmath46 closure of the subspace spanned by @xmath43 .",

    "the idea to construct a gmc measure is rather simple and standard : one defines the measure as the limit as @xmath56 goes to @xmath57 of @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a sequence which converges to @xmath6 as @xmath56 goes to @xmath57 and @xmath60 is some normalization sequence which ensures that the limit is non trivial .",

    "around 20 years later , robert - vargas @xcite proved a weak form of theorem [ th : existencechaos ] by showing convergence in law of @xmath99 .",
    "duplantier - sheffield @xcite proved theorem [ th : existencechaos ] in the special case where @xmath6 is the gff and @xmath59 is a circle average ( this work was followed by the work of chen - jakobson @xcite where the authors adapted arguments fom @xcite to the @xmath100 case ) .",
    "recently , the convergence in law proved in @xcite was reinforced to a convergence in probability by shamov @xcite ; the work of shamov @xcite , which relies on abstract gaussian space theory , is in fact quite general and does not concern just log - correlated @xmath6 . finally , let us mention that other works have now also established theorem [ th : existencechaos ] by rather elementary methods : see berestycki @xcite and junnila - saksman @xcite ( this work is also interesting because it extends the theory to the critical case @xmath101 where one can define a modified gmc theory ; however , we will not consider the critical case @xmath101 in these notes ) .",

    "the above proposition implies that the gmc measure associated to a log - correlated field @xmath6 exhibits multifractal behaviour , i.e. the measure is not scale invariant but rather is locally hlder around each point .",
    "the hlder exponent depends on the point ( for more on the so - called multifractal formalism , see the next subsection ) .",
    "more generally , one can take as a definition that a random measure satisfying where @xmath110 is a strictly concave function is a multifractal measure .",
    "now , we turn to the multifractal formalism of the measures @xmath64 .",
    "the measures @xmath64 are multifractal in the sense that the regularity of the measure around a point @xmath111 depends on the point @xmath19 : this can easily be seen on figure [ figchaos ] .",
    "multifractal formalism is a general theory to study the regularity of measures like @xmath64 around each point : for more background on this see section 4 in @xcite .    for @xmath112 and @xmath1050 , \\frac{\\sqrt{2d}}{\\gamma}[$ ] , we consider the following set : @xmath113 in words , the set @xmath114 is made of the points @xmath19 such that @xmath115 .",

    "the main difficulty in our context is that the random constant @xmath128 for the ratio of both sides in really also depends on @xmath19 so the above approximation can not be used directly but is rather a guideline to get intuition on the behaviour of @xmath64 . in our case , if we assume @xmath129 , then the sets @xmath130 are the same ( however we stress that rigorously these two sets are not the same ) .",
    "finally , following the terminology of hu - miller - peres @xcite , a point @xmath19 which belongs to @xmath131 is nowadays called a @xmath9-thick point .",
    "now , among the sets @xmath114 ( and @xmath117 ) , the set @xmath132 ( resp .",
    "@xmath131 ) is of particular importance for @xmath64 since it is the set on which the measure @xmath64 `` lives '' .",
    "more specifically , we have @xmath133 in the modern terminology of @xcite , one says that @xmath64 lives on the @xmath9-thick points of @xmath6 .",

    "setting , the goal of lqft is to make sense of and compute as much as possible the following correlation functions which arise in theoretical physics under the following heuristic form : @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the `` lebesgue '' measure on functions @xmath202 and @xmath203 is the liouville action : @xmath204 where recall that @xmath13 is the round metric , the constant @xmath205 is defined by @xmath206 and @xmath199 .",
    "lqft is therefore an * interacting * quantum field theory where the interaction term is @xmath207 the positive parameter @xmath208 , called the cosmological constant , is necessary for the existence of lqft .",
    "however , a remarkable feature of lqft is that the parameter @xmath9 is the essential parameter of the theory as it completely determines the conformal properties of the theory ( in cft language , the parameter @xmath9 determines the central charge : we will come back to this point later in more detail ) . following the standard terminology of cft",
    "( see previous chapter ) , the @xmath209 are local primary fields ( the conformal covariance property will be proved in the next chapter ) ; in fact , in the context of lqft , the @xmath209 are also called vertex operators .    it is a well known fact that the `` lebesgue measure '' @xmath201 does not exist since the space of functions @xmath202 is infinite dimensional ; however , it is a standard procedure in the probabilistic approach to quantum field theory ( see simon s reference book @xcite on the topic ) to interpret the term @xmath210 as the gaussian free field ( gff ) , i.e. the gaussian field whose covariance is given by the green function on @xmath211 .",
    "one way to see that this is the proper definition is to perform the following integration by parts @xmath212 formally , this corresponds to a gaussian with covariance @xmath213 .",
    "in fact , thanks to the theory of probability , one can define the gff rigorously with the following definition :    the gff with vanishing mean on the sphere @xmath214 is the gaussian field living in the space of distributions such that for all smooth functions @xmath215 on @xmath211 @xmath216    =    \\int_{\\s } \\int_{\\s } g_g(z , z ' ) f(z ) h(z ' )   g(z ) g(z ' ) dz dz'\\ ] ] where @xmath217 is the green function for the laplacian on the sphere defined for all @xmath218 by @xmath219    the random variable @xmath214 lives in the space of random distributions but in fact it exists in a sobolev space and @xmath220 makes sense for many functions @xmath29 ( with less regularity than @xmath38 ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath221 makes sense and is equal to @xmath57 actually : this is why we call @xmath214 the gff with vanishing mean on the sphere .",
    "it turns out that the green function has the following explicit form on @xmath211 @xmath222 where recall that @xmath17 is the standard euclidean distance .",
    "now , in the spirit of probabilistic quantum field theory , since formally we have @xmath223 and since we interpret @xmath224 as the gff measure , it is natural to interpret the formal measure @xmath225 as follows , for all functions @xmath47 ( up to a global constant ) @xmath226\\ ] ] where @xmath227 is the average of @xmath214 in a ball of radius @xmath56 with respect to the metric @xmath13 . however , there is something wrong with definition ; though it can be used to define a standard quantum field theory in the spirit of @xcite , it will lack symmetry to define a cft .",
    "the reason is that we have not taken into account the contribution of constant functions in the gaussian measure .",
    "this omission reflects in the fact that there is something arbitrary in the choice of @xmath214 : indeed , @xmath214 has vanishing mean on the sphere but we could have chosen an other gff on the sphere .",
    "in particular , @xmath214 is not conformally invariant since for all mbius transform @xmath185 the following equality holds in distribution : @xmath228 now , the average @xmath229 is a gaussian random variable which is non zero ( unless @xmath185 is an isometry of @xmath153 ) and hence @xmath230 does not have the same distribution as @xmath214 .",
    "one very natural way to get rid of this average dependence is to replace @xmath214 by @xmath231 where @xmath232 is distributed according to the lebesgue measure ( and stands for the mean value of the field ) .",

    "in fact , it is standard in the physics literature to express the correlations of lqft in the complex plane and therefore to shift the metric dependence of the theory in the field @xmath231 : this simplifies many computations",
    ". let us describe how to do so .",
    "if @xmath56 is small then a ball @xmath240 of centre @xmath241 and radius @xmath56 in the round metric @xmath13 is to first order in @xmath56 the same as an euclidean ball @xmath242 of centre @xmath241 and radius @xmath243 .",
    "hence , the average @xmath244 ( with respect to balls in the round metric ) is roughly the same as @xmath245 where @xmath246 is the average of @xmath214 on an euclidean ball of radius @xmath56 .",

    "therefore , instead of working with @xmath231 , we will work with the shifted field @xmath253 and the approximations @xmath254 .",

    "one can show that the measure @xmath384 converges as @xmath339 goes to infinity towards a measure @xmath385 defined in the full plane , i.e. with state space @xmath386 ( one can notice that we have removed the superscript @xmath374 in the full plane measure ; indeed one can show that this limit does not depend on the boundary conditions used to define the approximation measures on @xmath376 ) .",
    "the model was conjectured by physicists to be described by a specific cft with central charge @xmath387 with two primary fields ( to be precise there are three primary fields in the theory but the third one is just the constant @xmath124 ) .",
    "we will denote the two primary fields @xmath388 ( the spin field ) and @xmath389 ( the energy density field ) .",
    "we consider the spin field first and set the following definition for non coincident points @xmath390 and @xmath264 even @xmath391    if @xmath185 is a mobius transform on the sphere then @xmath392 and therefore @xmath393 hence in cft langage @xmath1 has conformal weight @xmath394 .",
    "let @xmath395 denote the integer part . for @xmath396 , we are now interested in the scaling limit as @xmath56 goes to @xmath57 of the discrete spin field @xmath397 defined on the rescaled lattice @xmath398 under the measure @xmath385 ( see figure [ fighongler ] for a simulation of the spin field ) .",
    "in view of , it is natural to rescale the field by the factor @xmath399 .",
    "now the following convergence holds for the rescaled correlations @xmath400",
    "\\underset{\\epsilon \\to 0}{\\rightarrow } c^n <",

    "this important theorem was proved by chelkak - hongler - izyuorv @xcite building on the fermionic observable first studied by smirnov @xcite and chelkak - smirnov @xcite ; in fact the main theorem in @xcite shows the convergence of the rescaled correlations to an explicit expression in any domain ( not just the full plane ) .",
    "the convergence result was also proved independently by dubdat @xcite by an exact bosonization procedure ( roughly , bosonization means in this context that there exists an exact relation between the squared correlation functions of the ising model on a lattice and the correlations of the exponential of the discrete gff on a lattice ) . as is standard in rigorous cft",
    ", one can define the limit @xmath1 as a random distribution .",
    "more precisely , camia - garban - newman @xcite proved that there exists a random distribution @xmath1 defined on some probability space such that @xmath401 converges in law in the space of distributions towards @xmath1 .",
    "finally , let us mention that similar results can be proved for the energy density field @xmath56 .",
    "in this case , the properly rescaled ( and recentered ) energy @xmath402 of a bond between two adjacent vertices @xmath403 converges towards the field @xmath56 ( in the sense of the correlation functions ) : this is proved in hongler @xcite and hongler - smirnov @xcite ( in any domain and not just the full plane ) .",
    "it was also proved independently in the full plane by boutillier and de tilire on general periodic isoradial graphs @xcite .",
    "there also exist explicit formulas for the correlations @xmath404 of the field @xmath56 ( but we will not write them here : see @xcite ) and the field @xmath56 has conformal weight @xmath405 , i.e. @xmath406 let us further mention that the energy density field can not be understood as a random distribution hence @xmath184 is not a real measure in .      in these lecture notes",
    ", we introduced the theory of lqft based on kahane s gmc theory .",
    "more precisely , we introduced the correlation functions and the random measures of the theory .",
    "we stated that they satisfy the main assumptions of a cft on the riemann sphere . as a comparison and to illustrate the full power of cft , we also presented in cft language the recent developments around the ising model in 2d at the critical point .",
    "we would like to stress as a final remark the conceptual difference in the mathematical treatment of the two cfts .",
    "the methods of probabilistic quantum field theory developed in the 1970 - 1980 around path integral formulations have been up to now unsuccessful to construct the cft which describes the scaling limit of the ising model at critical temperature ; it is conjectured that such a construction should exist .",
    "nonetheless , this cft has been rigorously constructed mathematically by taking the scaling limit of the discrete ising model hence leaving open the other approach . on the lqft side ,",
    "recall that random planar maps ( which correspond to discrete gravity ) were introduced because defining lqft by path integral formulations seemed troublesome .",
    "the idea was to construct lqft by taking the scaling limit of large planar maps .",
    "however , as we have seen in these lecture notes , a direct construction of lqft by path integral formulation is feasible whereas proving the convergence of large planar maps is a very difficult topic .",
    "indeed , the convergence has only been established up to now for very specific topologies ( of convergence ) .",
    "in this subsection , we recall basic definitions and facts on triangulations equipped with a conformal structure . this part is mostly based on rhode s paper @xcite .",
    "a finite triangulation @xmath407 is a graph you can embed in the sphere such that each inner face has three adjacent edges ( the edges do not cross and intersect only at vertices ) .",
    "the triangulation @xmath407 has size @xmath339 if it has @xmath339 faces .",
    "we see each triangle @xmath408 as an equilateral triangle of fixed volume @xmath409 say that we glue topologically according to the edges and the vertices .",
    "this defines a topological structure ( and even a metric structure ) .",
    "now , we put a conformal structure on @xmath407 .",
    "we need an atlas , i.e. a family of compatible charts .",
    "we map the inside of each triangle @xmath348 to the same triangle in the complex plane . if two triangles are adjacent in the triangulation , we map them to two adjacent equilateral triangles in the complex plane",
    "now , we need to define an atlas in the neighborhood of a vertex @xmath410 . the vertex @xmath410 is surrounded by @xmath264 triangles .",
    "we first map these triangles in the complex plane in counterclockwise order and such that each is equilateral .",
    "then we use the map @xmath411 to `` unwind '' the triangles ( in fact , this unwinds the triangles only if @xmath412 ) to define a homeomorphism around the vertex @xmath410 . by the uniformization theorem",
    ", we can find a conformal map @xmath413 where we send @xmath265 points in @xmath407 called roots to fixed points @xmath414 .",
    "for each triangle @xmath348 , we can consider @xmath353 , the restriction of @xmath185 to @xmath348 , as a standard conformal map from @xmath348 to a distorted triangle @xmath415 .",
    "it is then natural to equip @xmath416 with the standard pullback metric .",
    "more precisely , in each triangle @xmath352 the metric is given by @xmath417 and then one can define the metric in @xmath416 by gluing the metric of each distorted triangle @xmath352 .",
    "this metric has conical singularities at the points @xmath418 of the form @xmath419 where @xmath410 is a vertex of @xmath407 .",
    "since @xmath420 is analytic , we have @xmath421 around @xmath418 ( to see this compose @xmath420 with the chart @xmath411 ) . recall that the metric on @xmath211 around @xmath418 is of the form @xmath422 .",
    "we have @xmath423 .",
    "therefore , there is little mass around points @xmath412 and big mass around points @xmath424 .",
    "this metric has a cone interpretation .",
    "if @xmath425 is some angle and @xmath426 is the corresponding cone , one can put a conformal structure on the cone by the function @xmath427 in which case the metric is @xmath428 where @xmath429 is in @xmath306 - 1 , \\infty[$ ] . therefore , around @xmath57 , the average ricci curvature is then given by @xmath430 in the case of triangulations , the angle @xmath37 is related to @xmath264 by the formula @xmath431 : this means that there is negative curvature ( and little mass ) around @xmath418 if @xmath412 and the opposite if @xmath424 .",
