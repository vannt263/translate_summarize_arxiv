    "density functional theory ( dft ) has become the most successful method for condensed matter calculations .",
    "this success is largely rooted in the simplicity of the exchange and correlation ( xc ) energy in the local density ( lda ) or generalized gradient ( gga ) approximation",
    ". however , the underlying kohn - sham ( ks ) formalism fails in the prediction of electronic excitation energies of semiconductors and insulators.@xcite a significant step forward to correct excitation energies was achieved when the first _ ab initio _ calculations of quasiparticle ( qp ) states were performed.@xcite their description is based on the quasiparticle equation with the xc self - energy @xmath3 for one excited electron or hole.@xcite in general , its solution is based on hedin s @xmath1 approximation ( gwa ) for the self - energy @xcite and a perturbative treatment of the difference to the xc potential used in the ks equation .",
    "the central quantity is the dynamically screened coulomb potential @xmath4 , which characterizes the reaction of the electronic system after excitation . for many non - metals , such as the semiconductor silicon ( si ) ,",
    "the method works well with an accuracy of 0.10.3  ev for their qp gaps,@xcite if the green s function @xmath5 is described by one pole at the ks ( i.e. , @xmath6 ) , or better , at the qp ( i.e. , @xmath5 ) energy .",
    "however , for systems with a wrong energetic ordering of the ks bands first - order perturbation theory is not applicable.@xcite examples are semiconductors with a negative fundamental gap in dft - lda or -gga , e.g. inn @xcite ( and references therein ) , or with shallow @xmath2 bands , e.g. zno.@xcite    besides the ks approach itself , the origin of the band gap problem is related to the semi - local approximation ( lda / gga ) for xc , which introduces an unphysical self - interaction and lacks a derivative discontinuity.@xcite these deficiencies can be partially overcome using self - interaction - free exact exchange ( exx ) potentials,@xcite which are special realizations of an optimized effective potential ( oep ) method.@xcite a , by conception , different way to address the band gap problem is the use of a generalized kohn - sham ( gks ) scheme , which means starting from a scheme with a spatially non - local xc potential.@xcite in this framework , the screened - exchange ( sx ) approximation uses a statically screened coulomb kernel instead of the bare kernel in the hartree - fock ( hf ) exchange @xcite and , with it , resembles the screened - exchange ( sex ) contribution to the xc self - energy in the gwa.@xcite other hybrid functionals such as those following the suggestions of adamo and barone ( pbe0)@xcite or heyd , scuseria , and ernzerhof ( hse03 ) @xcite combine parts of bare or screened exchange with an explicit density functional",
    ". the gks eigenvalues are usually in much better agreement with the experiment than the lda / gga ones .",
    "therefore , the gks solutions are supposed to be superior starting points for a qp correction , since first - order perturbation theory should be justified .",
    "hence the replacement of @xmath5 by @xmath6 calculated from solutions of a gks scheme may be interpreted as a first step towards a self - consistent determination of the self - energy operator.@xcite    here we report a systematic study of qp energies calculated from @xmath1 corrections to the results of gks schemes .",
    "first , in section [ ssec : fnc ] we evaluate the performance of @xmath0 corrections to different gks starting points for si , inn , and zno using the functionals sx , hse03 , pbe0 , and hf .",
    "the results are compared to those of the standard ks approach based on an lda functional . in section [ ssec : selfconsistent ]",
    "qp gaps are calculated for a benchmark set of fifteen non - metalls utilizing the hse03 starting point .",
    "the effects of selfconsistency in @xmath5 and @xmath4 are discussed in comparison to the results based on a gga starting point used in ref . .",
    "all calculations are performed at the experimental lattice constants .",
    "we use the projector augmented - wave ( paw ) method as implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _",
    "simulation package.@xcite for the details of the @xmath1 implementation we refer to refs .   and .",
    "the @xmath1 calculations are carried out using a total number of 150 bands for all materials .",
    "for the brillouin - zone integrations , @xmath7 @xmath8-point meshes including the @xmath9 point were used , except in the case of zno ( lda ) and inn ( sx , hse03 ) where the @xmath8-point convergence of @xmath4 was found to be critical for meshes containing @xmath9 . in these cases ,",
    "@xmath7 monkhorst - pack @xmath8-point grids avoiding @xmath9 were used for the evaluation of @xmath4 .",
    "one problem of the presence of shallow @xmath2 levels is the strong core - valence xc interaction.@xcite it can be estimated within the lda or hf approximation , where the latter one is expected to be more reliable since the @xmath1 self - energy approaches the bare fock exchange operator in the short wave - length regime ( i.e. , at large electron binding energies ) . therefore , we apply the hf approximation to the core - valence xc self - energy for all @xmath1 calculations reported here ( see ref . for a validation of this approach ) .",
    "here we do not update the qp wave functions corresponding to the neglect of non - diagonal matrix elements of the self - energy represented in terms of the gks wave functions @xmath10 .",
    "the qp excitation energy @xmath11 of a state @xmath12 in the ( n+1)-th iteration is related the n - th iteration through the linearized equation : @xmath13 , \\end{split }   \\label{equ_qpshift2}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the kinetic energy operator , @xmath15 the nuclei - potential , @xmath16 the hartree potential , and @xmath17 the renormalization factor given by @xmath18 the first iteration , usually denoted by @xmath0,@xcite is based on the gks eigenvalues @xmath19 as initial input to the @xmath1 calculation . within this approximation",
    "the perturbation operator in becomes @xmath20 corresponding to the difference between the @xmath1 self - energy and the non - local xc potential used in the gks equation , and the @xmath0-qp shift for a certain gks state is given by : @xmath21    .parameters of the gks exchange functionals used.[tab_par ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we address the @xmath2-band binding energies calculated upon the hse03 and pbe starting point for different levels of quasiparticle selfconsistency , as shown in table [ tab_dbands ] .",
    "we have to note that the present calculations do not include the @xmath22 and @xmath23 orbitals with the same main quantum number as the semi - core @xmath2 shell .",
    "however , since here the core - valence interaction is approximated by hf exchange rather than by lda , as inherent to conventional pseudopotential calculations , the values given in table [ tab_dbands ] already provide a reasonable estimate for the @xmath2-band binding energies ( cf .",
    "ref .   and ) .",
    "updated values for the pbe case are also supplied ; the present values supercede those in ref . and are more accurate , since the all - electron charge density is now accurately restored on the plane wave grid.@xcite in general , the qp binding energies increase over the hse03 one - electron values due to the quasiparticle corrections , which can be understood mainly from the effects of the enhanced core - valence interaction in the @xmath1 calculations . only in the case of zns",
    "this trend does not hold for yet unknown reasons .",
    "however , compared to the experimental values all three quasiparticle schemes studied here underestimate the @xmath2-band binding energies .",
    "with increasing selfconsistency along the row ( @xmath0 , @xmath24 , and @xmath1 ) the @xmath2 bands shift to larger binding energies .",
    "thereby , for the ga  @xmath25 levels , the calculated values approach the experimental ones . in the case of the zn  @xmath25 levels , which are just below the @xmath23-like upper valence band complex , the situation is different with a more pronounced underestimation of the binding energies .",
    "analogue observations have been made for a gga starting point,@xcite which gives a smaller @xmath2-band binding energy than the hse03 starting point for each level of selfconsistency .",
    "we note that fleszar and hanke observed that the inclusion of vertex corrections in the self - energy shifts the @xmath2 states to stronger binding energies,@xcite suggesting that the neglect of such corrections is responsible for the erroneous behavior of the @xmath1 approximation for @xmath2 states .",
    "we have presented @xmath0 qp calculations starting from a variety of xc functionals : lda , sx , hse03 , pbe0 , and hf for si , inn and zno .",
    "we have shown that the gks schemes , which take into account a screened exchange potential or part of it ( sx , hse03 ) , give rise to eigenvalues close to the qp excitation energies .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 corrections were found to yield qp energies in good agreement with the experimental data , and the qp shifts are less dispersive than those calculated upon lda .",
    "overall the hse03 and pbe0 functionals gave one - electron energies very close to the successive @xmath1 calculations , resulting in small qp gap corrections across the considered energy range .",
    "for the hse03+@xmath0 case , the final qp energies were in very good agreement with experiment , whereas the pbe0 functional was found to yield too large qp gaps .",
    "we traced this back to a significant underestimation of the screening for the pbe0 functional , when the random phase approximation is used ( also applied to determine @xmath4 ) .",
    "furthermore , the qp gaps for 15 materials comprising small and large gap systems were calculated , in order to provide a benchmark of the hse03 starting point against the gga one .",
    "it was shown that the hse03+@xmath0 approach yields an almost halved overall error for the fundamental gaps compared to the gga starting point .",
    "the largest improvement over the lda / gga starting points were found for materials with shallow @xmath2 states such as zno , zns , inn , gaas , and gan , where the lda / gga starting point suffers from a significant underestimation of the @xmath2-band binding energies and a consequently overestimated repulsion between @xmath23- and @xmath2-like states . since the @xmath2-band binding energies calculated using one of the gks schemes ( e.g. hse03 ) are closer to the experiment , the influence of the @xmath26 repulsion on the gap is described more accurately .",
    "furthermore , the effects of different degrees of selfconsistency were investigated .",
    "it was found that both , selfconsistency in @xmath5 ( @xmath24 ) and selfconsistency in @xmath5 and @xmath4 ( @xmath1 ) , impair the agreement with experimental data . for @xmath24 ,",
    "this is in contrast to the findings for a gga starting point.@xcite this could be traced back to the poorer description of the dielectric screening for the hse03 starting point .",
    "selfconsistency according to the @xmath1 scheme with an update of eigenvalues in both @xmath5 and @xmath4 further diminishes the agreement with measurements , due to a further reduction of the already underestimated screening .",
    "this is analoge to the findings for gga based @xmath1 calculations . in general , concerning selconsistent qp schemes , the present work confirms the observation already made in previous work : to obtain accurate qp gaps it is essential to use an electronic response function and a screened interaction @xmath4 that agree closely with experiment,@xcite and to combine this screened interaction with an accurate green s function @xmath5 . for the @xmath24 case based upon hse03 wave functions",
    ", the overestimation of the gaps clearly relates to an underestimation of the static electronic screening employing hse03 and the random phase approximation . in this light ,",
    "the success of the perturbative single - shot hse03+@xmath0 approach is a little bit fortuitous , since the overestimation of the screening is partially canceled by too small gap corrections obtained using the single - shot perturbative @xmath0 approach .",
    "probably the same is true for some other single shot approaches , such as exx - oep+@xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , if computational efficiency is an important issue and it more often is than not then the hse03+@xmath0 approach is indeed an excellent balance between accuracy and speed .",
    "the calculations are as efficient as for the commonly used lda+@xmath0 method , and , with very few exceptions , the errors are smaller than 10  % . if better accuracy is required , it can be achieved , but only by updating the wave functions and including excitonic effects in the calculation of the screening properties , i.e. , vertex corrections in @xmath4.@xcite for most mater , such calculations are currently not feasible due to the large computational requirements",
    ".    a similar accuracy as for the hse+@xmath0 approach can be achieved by starting from gga wave functions and eigenvalues , and updating the eigenvalues in @xmath5 until convergence is reached ( see ref . ) .",
    "this approach yields comparable errors as hse03+@xmath0 , but it is computationally more demanding , since several iterations are required to converge @xmath5 .",
    "the latter method is also problematic for materials with an inverted band order in lda / gga .",
    "which approach to choose ( hse03+@xmath0 or gga+@xmath24 ) is to some extend a matter of taste , and the final results are usually very close and often bracket the experiment . if efficiency and robustness ( band order ) are issues , the hse03+@xmath0 approach seems to be preferable , and it is certainly much more accurate than the traditional lda+@xmath0 method .    concerning the position of the @xmath2 levels , the hse03+@xmath0 method shows an underestimation of the @xmath2-band binding energies by about 1  ev for almost all materials .",
    "similar observations were made for the lda / gga case,@xcite and lda+u based @xmath1 calculations,@xcite and self - consistent quasiparticle @xmath1 ( scqpgw ) calculations.@xcite the underestimation of the @xmath2-band binding energy is thus universal to the @xmath1 approximation and not related to the starting wavefunctions .",
    "the origin for this underestimation is yet unknown , but it is most likely related to the fact that the @xmath1 approximation is not entirely free of self - interaction errors , and only inclusion of vertex corrections in the self - energy might remedy this deficiency.@xcite",
