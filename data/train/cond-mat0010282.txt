    "since the appearance of the scaling theory of disordered metals @xcite , the theory of localization in @xmath2 systems has become well established .",
    "of course , this phenomenon depends on symmetries .",
    "the addition of spin - orbital impurities leads to the violation of central symmetry and hence a situation when the resistivity vanishes at small frequencies . at the same time ,",
    "the delocalizing effect of a magnetic field is apparent in a number of well - known phenomena , a natural example being the integer quantum hall effect in @xmath2 @xcite ( for a review see e.g. ref.@xcite ) .",
    "another example is provided by the random flux model which describes , for example , electron hopping on a bipartite lattice structure with link disorder @xcite . in this model a tendency towards delocalization is displayed as the band center is approached due to the existence of a chiral symmetry at the band center @xcite .",
    "a question of long - standing interest in this context has been the influence of a random , static magnetic field on a two - dimensional electron gas .",
    "this is an example of a disordered system with a broken time reversal invariance , where the effects of the magnetic field can become very complicated .",
    "interest in this problem has been stimulated by its relevance to a variety of experimental situations .",
    "the solution of the problem might help to clarify the behavior of composite fermions for the fractional quantum hall effect near half - filling @xcite . in this model , the interacting electron liquid",
    "is replaced by a fermi gas of quasiparticles , each carrying two flux quanta of a fictitious magnetic field .",
    "while the chern - simons field exactly cancels the external field at half - filling , variations in the electron density due to screening of the impurity potential leads to fluctuations in the effective magnetic field around the zero value .",
    "a similar model applies also in the gauge - field description @xcite of doped mott insulators , where slow fluctuations in the gauge field may be approximated by a static random field .",
    "further experimental realizations have involved the introduction of a random magnet field ( with non - zero mean ) onto a high - mobility 2d semiconductor through an overlayer containing randomly pinned flux vortices @xcite or type - i superconducting grains @xcite or through a nearby permanent magnet @xcite .    a theoretical analysis of the random magnetic field ( rmf ) problem is made technically difficult due to the spatially long - ranged nature of the vector potential correlations , which result even for short - ranged magnetic field correlations . for example , a straightforward application of perturbation theory @xcite readily demonstrates the appearance of infrared divergencies in the born approximation for the single - particle green function .",
    "consequently a wide variety of alternative techniques have been applied to this problem .",
    "a real - space path integral representation has been introduced by altshuler and ioffe @xcite and altshuler _ et al_. @xcite , while the eikonal @xcite and related paraxial @xcite approximations have also been employed .",
    "if the correlation length , @xmath3 , of the random magnetic field is sufficiently large that @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the single - particle mean free path and @xmath6 is the fermi momentum , then a `` classical '' regime is reached in which the contribution of classical memory effects has been shown to be significant @xcite . if in addition the rmf is sufficiently strong that @xmath3 is greater than the average cyclotron radius , then a description of electron transport in terms of percolation between a network of ` snake'-states at zero b - field contours becomes appropriate @xcite",
    ".    numerical investigation of the rmf model ( equivalent to the random flux model away from the band center ) has continued without apparent consensus , mainly due to the great difficulty of distinguishing between delocalization and localization of states with the very large localization length that is typical for two dimensions at large conductances .",
    "conclusions for this model are divided between localization of all states @xcite , the existence of a critical region @xcite , and the localization of all states except at precisely zero energy @xcite .",
    "it is also of interest that , even for the case of one dimension , recent analytical @xcite and numerical @xcite work supports the existence of a metal - insulator transition in the presence of sufficiently long - ranged disorder correlations .    in this paper , we study the @xmath2 electron gas with long range disorder .",
    "we assume that the time reversal symmetry is broken .",
    "our approach applies both to the rmf model and also to a model with a long range , potential disorder and a constant magnetic field .",
    "the latter model is very close to models with short - range disorder with broken time - reversal invariance ( unitary ensemble ) for which the localization of all states is well established .",
    "the leading order weak localization correction to the conductivity appears , for short range disorder , at two - loop order and is negative@xcite .",
    "while this result has been also derived from conventional diagrammatics  @xcite , an equivalent and more convenient procedure is provided by field theoretical methods based on a nonlinear @xmath7-model . in addition , the use of the @xmath7-models allows one to prove the existence of the renormalization group ( rg ) and go beyond perturbation theory .",
    "aronov _ et al_.@xcite have already provided a generalization of the standard field - theoretical approach@xcite to the model of a delta - correlated rmf , in deriving an appropriate form of a supersymmetric @xmath7-model .",
    "they found that the @xmath0-model was identical to the one derived previously for short - range disordered systems with broken time - reversal invariance ( the unitary ensemble)@xcite , and therefore concluded that all states are localized as for the unitary ensemble . in an earlier paper , zhang and",
    "arovas @xcite had proposed the existence of an additional term in the @xmath0-model originating from logarithmic interaction of topological density or , equivalently , current - carrying edge states around magnetic domains ; this term was argued to lead to a kosterlitz - thouless transition from the localized to extended states with power - law correlations .",
    "unfortunately the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite relies on an incorrect relation between a correlator of hall conductivities and the average longitudinal conductivity , and the additional term was not found in the analysis of aronov _",
    "et al_. @xcite . as concerns the models in a constant magnetic field with an arbitrary range of disorder correlations , a conventional @xmath7-model , with a classical diffusion coefficient appropriate to the correlations , has been derived@xcite using similar methods to the work of aronov _",
    "et al_.    even so , the question has so far remained open of whether the new term written by zhang and arovas@xcite can exist in principle and , if so , what would be the possible consequences .",
    "we examine this possibility more carefully in this paper .",
    "first we focus on the case of a delta - correlated rmf model . for this model",
    ", we provide a derivation of the appropriate @xmath7-model , that is somewhat more complete than the original work of aronov _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "our derivation demonstrates the appearance of certain technical subtleties that were not realised in the original work of ref .",
    "this work is an extension of calculations presented previously in a short letter@xcite . as a first step we derive a form of the free energy that has appeared previously under the name of the ballistic @xmath1-model@xcite .",
    "in fact our derivation ( also presented in the letter@xcite ) represents the first formally justified derivation of the ballistic @xmath1-model , since the long - ranged nature of the disorder provides a small parameter ( the small ratio of the single - particle and transport lifetimes ) to allow a controlled separation of modes and expansion of the free energy , in contrast to previous derivations @xcite .",
    "indeed this approach allows us to go further and derive further terms to the usual ballistic @xmath1-model that become important for shorter - range disorder .",
    "we remark that our derivation of the ballistic @xmath1-model is valid for long - range potential disorder as well as for vector potential disorder , with minor modifications .",
    "integration over the degrees of freedom in this model that correspond to length - scales shorter than the transport mean free path allows us to derive the final form of the free energy that is applicable for the description of low - energy transport .",
    "along with the usual terms of the unitary @xmath1-model , we find an extra term which couples to the current - current correlator .",
    "this term appears also for models of long - range potential disorder , as well as vector potential disorder , as long as time - reversal symmetry is completely broken .",
    "the new term is similar to that written by zhang and arovas , except for the appearance of an additional factor @xmath8 that represents the current - current correlator .    for evaluation of the quantity @xmath8 ,",
    "it is necessary to employ an ultraviolet regularization procedure which should , as shown recently by gornyi _",
    "et al_.@xcite , be formulated carefully in order to preserve gauge invariance .",
    "the use of this procedure then indicates that the factor @xmath9 should vanish as @xmath10 , as confirmed by diagrammatic arguments .",
    "this implies that , within the scope of our analysis , the new term remains irrelevant for the delta - correlated rmf model in the calculation of corrections to the conductivity that are logarithmic in frequency , although it may still lead to higher order corrections known as memory effects ( we remark that our earlier letter@xcite employed a more naive regularisation procedure which led to incorrect conclusions ) .    as a result",
    "we do not find evidence for deviation of the scaling behaviour of the delta - correlated random magnetic field model from that of the conventional unitary ensemble .",
    "as such our conclusions coincide with those of the original work of aronov _",
    "et al_. , although for considerably more subtle reasons than were originally realised in that work ( which remains a partial analysis since they neglect higher harmonics of the @xmath11-matrix ) .",
    "even so , certain questions remain , concerning the role of the massive modes of the field theory , which deserve further study before a definitive conclusion can be drawn for this problem .",
    "we then generalize the argument to consider the possibility of longer - ranged disorder .",
    "we derive the free energy for a model of short - range disorder plus longer - ranged disorder , and showed how the long - range disorder couples to the free energy via a wess - zumino term .",
    "if the long - range disorder is sufficiently long - ranged that correlator of local currents remains finite in the limit of @xmath10 , then a new term appears in the free energy which is responsible for new corrections to the conductivity that are logarithmic in frequency .",
    "for this model , the new term does takes the same form as the one originally written by zhang and arovas@xcite ( although the latter work does not contain a correct microscopic justification ) . as follows from the preceding discussion , for this term to exist the magnetic field correlations must be longer - ranged than delta - correlated : instead , the fourier transform of the correlator @xmath12 must diverge as @xmath13 as @xmath10 , where @xmath14 is the magnetic field .    at the classical level",
    ", this free energy represents particle motion in a field of random velocities : similar classical models have already been considered@xcite , assuming the velocities to be delta - correlated . indeed ,",
    "et al_.@xcite and fisher _ et al_.@xcite have demonstrated , via a renormalization group analysis , that particle propagation in this purely classical problem ( the `` diffusion - advection model '' ) obeys a `` superdiffusion '' .",
    "the electron gas with the long - range disorder represents a quantum generalisation of this model , in which quantum coherence phenomena are also present and interplay with the above classical effects .    by performing a rg analysis of the free energy",
    ", we find that two competing contributions to the scaling form for the diffusion coefficient appear .",
    "the positive contribution corresponds to classical superdiffusion in the presence of long - ranged currents , while the negative contribution is the quantum mechanical , weak localization correction for the unitary ensemble .",
    "since the classical and quantum contributions to the conductivity are of opposite sign and potentially of the same order , we have the interesting possibility of a quantum phase transition in two dimensions at weak disorder , tuned by the relative disorder strengths .",
    "the plan for this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    ", we introduce the model for the delta - correlated rmf . in section",
    "[ sec : functional ] , we derive the free - energy functional for this model in terms of a supermatrix @xmath7-model .",
    "this involves deriving the ballistic @xmath1-model miscroscopically for this problem .",
    "we then simplify the free energy by integrating out degrees of freedom associated with length - scales shorter than the transport mean free path .",
    "the derivation is applicable with minor changes to a model with a potential long range disorder and a constant magnetic field . in section [ sec : pert ] , we present direct perturbation theory calculations of the conductivity and the current - current correlator . in section [ sec : superdiff ]",
    ", we review classical models of diffusion in a field of random velocities , and consider an electron gas in the presence of both short - range and longer - ranged disorder .",
    "we show how the local current couples to the free energy through a wess - zumino term , and how averaging over this term leads to a term similar to that written by zhang and arovas@xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : rg ] we subject the free energy to a renormalisation group analysis and derive the scaling form for the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this demonstrates the appearance of a positive contribution to the scaling form for the conductivity in competition with the usual negative , weak localization contribution .",
    "section [ sec : discuss ] concludes with a summary and discussion .",
    "some technical details are presented in the appendix .",
    "as we have mentioned in the introduction , the considerations below are applicable both to a rmf model , and to a model with long range potential impurities and a constant magnetic field ( to break time - reversal symmetry ) .",
    "while the derivation of the @xmath7-model is similar for the two types of model , to be specific we carry out calculations for the rmf model .",
    "we write the hamiltonian as follows , @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the electron charge and mass , @xmath18 is the velocity of light , @xmath19 is the fermi energy and @xmath20 is the vector potential .",
    "we focus below on the case where the magnetic field , @xmath21 , is delta - correlated , @xmath22 with a strength characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath23 ( and with @xmath24 ) , although one may as easily consider a more general case with a finite range of the correlations .",
    "we choose the london gauge for the vector potential @xmath20 @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the component taken at , and perpendicular to , the surface of the sample . the sample may be either truly two - dimensional , with the thickness of a single atomic layer , or simply have a two - dimensional geometry . while we write explicit formulae for the former case , extension to thicker samples",
    "is trivial .",
    "the correlations of the vector potential @xmath20 corresponding eqs .",
    "( [ a1b ] ) and ( [ a1a ] ) are long - ranged and we choose them in the form @xmath27 the correlator @xmath28 shown here is transversal , that is , @xmath29 which corresponds to the transversality of the vector potential @xmath20 , eq .",
    "( [ a1a ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 is a cutoff that renders finite the otherwise - infinite range of the disorder correlations .",
    "the @xmath31-correlated fluctuations of the magnetic field correspond to the limit @xmath32 .",
    "the cutoff @xmath33 appears @xcite in perturbation theory for the infrared - divergent single - particle lifetime .",
    "for example , the simple born approximation yields for the mean free time @xmath34 the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) displays a weaker divergency ,    @xmath35    due to off - shell contributions in the collision integral , eq .",
    "( [ tauscbaa ] ) .",
    "the inverse transport time @xmath36 remains convergent however in the limit of @xmath32 ,    @xmath37    although we focus on the above choice of correlator @xmath38 in this paper , we emphasize again that our method remains valid for an arbitrary form of disorder correlations , with minor modifications for scalar rather than vector potential disorder .",
    "in this section we derive the free energy functional for the 2d electron gas in the rmf .",
    "we employ the supersymmetry method which by now has been extensively developed @xcite as a method for the exact evaluation of spectral and wave function properties of metals with delta - correlated disorder . in the conventional case",
    "the free energy functional takes the form of a nonlinear @xmath7-model containing an @xmath39 , position - dependent @xmath11-matrix . in order to generalize the method to allow for long - ranged disorder correlations ,",
    "it becomes necessary to employ a @xmath11-matrix that depends on two position variables , rather than one .",
    "following a fourier transformation and a harmonic expansion around the fermi surface , the @xmath11-matrix may be represented as depending on a position variable and an angular harmonic index .",
    "the degrees of freedom contained in the non - zero harmonics of the @xmath11-matrix are weakly massive for a long range disorder and we integrate them out rather than neglect them . although the coupling of the non - zero harmonics to the zeroth harmonic is weak , integration over the nonzero harmonics requires some care to determine the possible renormalization of the effective functional for the zeroth harmonic .",
    "one consequence of this renormalization , due to the first harmonics only , amounts to the inclusion of two - particle vertex corrections to the single - particle lifetime , @xmath40 , leading to its replacement in the free energy by the transport relaxation time , @xmath41 .",
    "this was the main conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite , where arbitrary range potential impurities were considered , and of ref .",
    "@xcite , devoted to study of the rmf problem .",
    "we find however a further difficulty associated with the integration over non - zero harmonics that was not examined in the previous works@xcite .",
    "namely , additional terms arise in the free energy whose evaluation requires a careful integration over _ higher _ non - zero harmonics , rather than only the first harmonic as considered in the approach of refs .",
    "while the contribution of these terms seem finally to be irrelevant to computation of logarithmic corrections to the conductivity , as we discuss below , the proper demonstration of this fact is far from trivial and beyond the original analysis of ref.@xcite .    in order to properly include the potential contribution of the higher harmonics , we derive as an intermediate step a free energy that is similar to the `` ballistic @xmath7-model '' of muzykantskii and khmelnitskii @xcite .",
    "the latter model itself represents a generalization of the diffusive @xmath7-model to the case of ballistic disorder , where the typical energy scale of @xmath11-fluctuations may be as large as the inverse scattering time .",
    "in fact we also derive certain additional terms to their form of the free energy that become relevant for shorter - range disorder .    employing standard methods@xcite",
    ", we introduce a supersymmetric @xmath42-field that contains eight components , corresponding to fermion / boson , advanced / retarded and time - reversed sectors .",
    "an averaged product of green s functions may then be expressed in terms of a functional integral weighted by a lagrangian that is quadratic in the @xmath43-field : @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 is the pauli matrix in time - reversal space .",
    "we now average over the vector potential , @xmath20 . in doing",
    "so we neglect the term in @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ lag0 ] ) .",
    "this approximation is standard and has been used in previous analytic works on the rmf model@xcite .",
    "furthermore , for the case of long range potential disorder , for which our general method is valid , @xmath48-like terms are absent anyway .",
    "as for the question of gauge invariance , note that our derivation has assumed already a choice of gauge through the form of the vector potential correlations ( see section [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "nevertheless appendix [ app : asquare ] contains a discussion of how the @xmath48 term may be handled more carefully and found to be negligible .",
    "the term linear in @xmath20 induces after the averaging a term that is quartic in the @xmath43-fields and , in contrast to the case of short - range impurities , non - local in position : @xmath49 following an integration by parts , @xmath50 may be rewritten @xmath51 where @xmath52 in boson - fermion space .",
    "we now decouple @xmath53 via an @xmath54 matrix @xmath55 . while in the calculation for time",
    "reversal invariant systems@xcite , this step requires a careful identification of the slowly varying modes , in the case of the system with the broken time reversal invariance , all slow modes are easily identified as corresponding to  pairs @xmath56 .",

    "the free energy , eq . ( [ lag1 ] ) , in principle provides an exact description of the system but it is not useful in this form as it allows for all possible energy scales for @xmath11-fluctuations . as a first step in its simplification we search as usual for the saddle - point value of @xmath11 and perform a gradient expansion around this value to identify the free energy for low energy fluctuations .      to search for the saddle - point to eq .",
    "( [ lag1 ] ) , we take @xmath66 and @xmath11 to depend on @xmath67 only .",
    "this means that the cooperon `` degrees of freedom '' are suppressed and that the supermatrix @xmath11 at the saddle point is homogeneous in space .",

    "the matrices @xmath108 and @xmath109 obey the symmetries @xmath110    in what follows we will make expansions in deviations of the supermatrix @xmath111 from @xmath72 . for this purpose",
    "the supermatrix @xmath112 can be conveniently parametrized , for example , as @xmath113 with @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 .",
    "both @xmath108 and @xmath109 vary slowly with @xmath117 , that is , on length scales longer than @xmath118 . while @xmath119 represents the massless ( c ) modes , the weakly massive modes ( b )",
    "are contained in @xmath109 .",
    "it is the dependence of the supermatrix @xmath109 on the vector @xmath106 that leads to the gap in the spectrum of excitations of the ( b ) modes .    an important feature of our parametrization for @xmath120 in the form @xmath121 is the separation of the rotation matrix @xmath122 into the @xmath108 and @xmath109 factors .",
    "this step is not only convenient for computation but , more importantly , ensures the preservation of an original symmetry of the initial lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ lag0 ] ) .",
    "specifically , it ensures that the final free energy functional is invariant under global rotations @xmath123 with @xmath124 independent of coordinates .",
    "this invariance follows from the original invariance of the lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ lag0 ] ) , under global rotations @xmath125 .",
    "substitution of the parametrization ( [ param ] ) into expression ( [ lag1 ] ) yields a free energy in terms of only the weakly massive ( b ) modes and the massless ( c ) modes . accordingly",
    "this free energy will describe fluctuations over energy scales only much less than @xmath88 . in order to investigate the truly low - frequency behavior of transport coefficients ,",
    "however , we need to reduce this free energy even further by integrating over the weakly massive ( b ) modes . this procedure will reduce the free energy to a form in terms of only @xmath119 , representing the massless ( c ) modes . in this way we obtain the final form of the free energy that is applicable on energy scales much less than @xmath36 and so appropriate for the description of low - energy transport .",
    "it is necessary to integrate carefully over the ( b ) modes , rather than simply neglecting them , because , even though their coupling to the ( c ) modes is weak , it is sufficiently complicated to lead on integration to a potentially non - trivial renormalization of the bare free energy for the ( c ) modes . due to the soft mass of the ( b ) modes",
    "it is sufficient to apply a gaussian approximation in @xmath126 ; higher order terms give a small contribution provided the inequality @xmath127 ( equivalently , @xmath85 ) is fulfilled .    in principle , if the correlations of the disorder decay sufficiently slowly ( for the form of the correlations given by eq .  ( [ a2 ] ) , this applies in the limit of @xmath128 ) , one needs to employ a cutoff at large momentum @xmath129 ( short distance ) .",
    "the need for an ultra - violet regularization is well - known @xcite in the context of the ballistic @xmath7-model and originates from the fact that the gradient ( liouvillean ) operator in the logarithm of the initial lagrangian , eq .",

    "it turns out that in this model one needs to be careful about the precise form of the short - distance cutoff , a point which we discuss further below .",

    "to do so we simply set @xmath130 in eq .",

    "a straightforward gradient expansion of the lagrangian ( [ lag1 ] ) to second - order in the gradients then recovers the conventional @xmath7-model .",

    "this invariance remains conserved also for the case of long range disorder and is related to conservation of local currents .",

    "there does not seem to be a connection between the mobility studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and the conductivity of the electron gas with long - range disorder , and its dependence on the frequency differs from that for the diffusion coefficient .",
    "in summary , in this section we have subjected the free energy ( [ supfr2 ] ) to a rg procedure to derive to scaling equation for the diffusion coefficient . as showed in section [ sec : superdiff ] , the free energy ( [ supfr2 ] ) represents a quantum generalisation of the diffusion - advection problem and applies when the current - current correlator due to long - range disorder remains finite in the limit of @xmath10 .",
    "the scaling form for the diffusion coefficient contains a positive contribution , which corresponds to classical superdiffusion , and a negative contribution , which is the usual weak localization correction for the unitary ensemble .",
    "since they are of opposite sign , the two contributions may compete and this leads to the possibility of a quantum phase transition in two dimensions at weak disorder , tuned by the relative disorder strengths .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the 2d electron gas with long range disorder and broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "we have provided a careful derivation of the free energy for this system .",
    "we have shown how the the ballistic @xmath1-model may be derived in a controlled manner for this problem , due to the presence of the small parameter @xmath155 , thus providing the first formal derivation of this model .",
    "we also derived certain additional terms which are beyond the usual form of the ballistic @xmath1-model but become important for shorter - range disorder .",
    "integration over nonzero harmonics of the @xmath11-matrix leads to a free energy with with an extra term beyond those of the conventional unitary @xmath1-model .",
    "the evaluation of the extra term requires the use of a proper regularisation procedure of the ballistic @xmath1-model that ensures the preservation of gauge invariance and that has been verified by diagrammatic means .",
    "this demonstrates that , within the scope of our analysis of the delta - correlated rmf model , the extra term in the free energy seems to remain irrelevant in the calculation of corrections to the conductivity that are logarithmic in frequency . as a result",
    "we do not find evidence for deviation of the localization behaviour of the delta - correlated random magnetic field model from that of the conventional unitary ensemble .",
    "as such our conclusions coincide with those of the original work of aronov _",
    "et al_. , although for considerably more subtle reasons than were originally realised in that work ( which remains a partial analysis due to their neglect of the higher harmonics of the @xmath11-matrix ) .",
    "certain questions for this model remain regarding the role of the massive ( a ) modes , which describe fluctuations of the eigenvalues of @xmath11 and the cooperons , and which have been neglected in our analysis .",
    "for example , the precise value of the single - particle lifetime that couples to the massive modes ( a ) remains to be determined , and is likely to remain finite as the infrared cutoff @xmath156 is taken to zero .",
    "this suggests that an improved saddle - point may be found which does not contain any divergencies in the limit of @xmath157 . a proper treatment of the massive ( a ) modes would allow the application of the ballistic @xmath1-model down to distances of the order of the single - particle mean free path , which is desirable since the evaluation of the new term in the free energy depends crucially on the the regularization procedure at such short length - scales .    the derivation of the free energy was supplemented by direct perturbative calculations within the field theory formalism .",
    "we calculated the conductivity directly and showed the appearance of an additional correction , that is analogous to the new term in the free energy and is higher order than logarithmic .",
    "we also calculated the current - current correlation function , thus providing a physical interpretation for the coefficient of the new term in the free energy .",
    "we then generalised the discussion to include the possibility of longer ranged disorder .",
    "we derived the free energy for a model containing both short - range disorder and longer - ranged disorder , and showed how the long - range disorder couples to the free energy via a wess - zumino term .",
    "if the long - range disorder is sufficiently long - ranged that the correlator of local currents remains finite in the limit of @xmath10 , then a new term appears in the free energy which is responsible for new corrections to the conductivity that are logarithmic in frequency .",
    "we have demonstrated how this free energy may be described as a quantum generalisation of the diffusion - advection model . by performing a rg analysis of the free energy ,",
    "we have shown how two competing contributions to the scaling form for the diffusion coefficient appear .",
    "the positive contribution corresponds to classical superdiffusion in the presence of long - ranged currents , while the negative contribution is the conventional , weak localization correction for the unitary ensemble .",
    "the competition between the classical and quantum contributions to the conductivity leads to the interesting possibility of a quantum phase transition in two dimensions at weak disorder , tuned by the relative disorder strengths .",
    "we remark that a direct diagrammatic calculation of the leading logarithmic correction to the conductivity would be a useful check of the predictions of the field theory for the delta - correlated rmf model .",
    "the diagrammatic arguments of gornyi _",
    "et al_.@xcite do not fulfill the purpose of such a check : although their calculation of the current - current correlation function seems valid , their calculation of the conductivity relies on a relation between the conductivity and the current - current correlation function that seems questionable for the delta - correlated rmf model , since it depends on the quantity @xmath152 that formally vanishes within the scba .",
    "instead their arguments would seem to be applicable when the rmf is a weak perturbation to sufficiently strong , short - range disorder , in which case a well - defined @xmath152 does exist . a direct diagrammatic calculation of the first logarithmic correction to the conductivity , which is not simple even for short - range disorder , therefore remains to be attempted for the delta - correlated rmf model .",
    "we remark also that further analysis of the free energy , ( [ supfr2 ] ) , with its new term , is deserved .",
    "for example , the influence of the new term on the scaling of the conductivity at small conductance , and its interplay with the usual topological term , remains an interesting open question .",
    "the general expression ( [ phifr2 ] ) for the free energy of a disordered conductor in the presence of equilibrium currents also presents new possibilities for further investigation , possibly in different dimensionalities .",
    "the method of derivation of the ballistic @xmath1-model in this paper , by which a controlled expansion of the free energy becomes possible through the smallness of the parameter @xmath155 , opens a promising avenue for further development of ballistic field - theories .",
    "it is possible that progress in this direction may help to resolve the problem of `` repetitions''@xcite in the ballistic @xmath1-model for chaotic systems .",

    "an alternative argument for the neglect of the @xmath48 term may be formulated as follows : we may treat the @xmath48 term in the lagrangian ( [ lag0 ] ) perturbatively and check that it gives only a parametrically small correction to the previously - derived terms in the free energy .    a leading - order contribution of the @xmath47 term , that is fourth - order in @xmath485 , may be estimated via a third - order cumulant expansion : this gives rise to the contribution to the lagrangian of @xmath486 choosing a typical pairing of the @xmath485 and @xmath43 fields gives an estimate of a typical resulting contribution to the free energy : @xmath487 in fact due to the combination of three @xmath11 s in the structure of @xmath488 , this terms does not contribute at all to the free energy of the form of eq .",

    "the other leading - order contribution , that is fourth - order in @xmath485 , appears from the second - order cumulant : @xmath490 choosing a typical pairing as before gives an estimate of a typical resulting contribution to the free energy as @xmath491 we notice that the term @xmath492 is again second - order in the scattering amplitude @xmath28 , as compared to the usual collision term in the ballistic @xmath7-model ( eq .",
    "( [ m+k ] ) ) which is only first - order in @xmath28 . as a result",
    "it is straightforward to check that the term @xmath493 produces a renormalization of the collision term by a parametrically small factor @xmath494 .",
    "higher - order cumulants of the @xmath47 term in the original lagrangian will clearly produce only smaller renormalizations of the collision term corresponding to higher powers of this small parameter . in this way",
