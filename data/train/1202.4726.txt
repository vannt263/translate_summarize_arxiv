    "the body - centered cubic ( bcc ) @xmath0-phase is stable from pure iron to @xmath8 10 % ni and increasing the ni concentration in @xmath0-fe reduces its stability with respect to @xmath9-fe which is why nickel is designated a @xmath9-stabilizer.@xcite fe - ni alloys are also of interest in connection with invar effect and martensitic transformation at low temperatures.@xcite fe - ni alloys are amongst the most studied magnetic materials and are important in understanding the mechanical and magnetic properties of steels .",
    "considerable efforts have been made to understand the stability of magnetic materials in terms of magnetism and bain transformation,@xcite but with the focus on bain path of either pure bcc fe , or fcc fe , or hcp fe , rather than on the consequences of the presence of nickel as a solute .",
    "much attention has also been given in the past to fe - ni alloys near invar compositions or ordered compounds ( fe@xmath10ni , feni , or feni@xmath10 ) , but not dilute alloys with less than 10% nickel.@xcite recently ,  @xcite we studied the electronic and magnetic structures of transition metal impurities in bcc fe where we also found that ni impurity enhances the magnetism of bcc fe . to further elucidate the effect of ni on iron ,",
    "we examine here the elastic properties , thermodynamics , and the effects of magnetism on the bain path using first - principles calculations .",
    "we considered a @xmath11 supercell of the primitive cell of bcc fe , which contains 27 atomic sites .",
    "the centered fe atom is replaced by the ni atom ; we denote the model as ni@xmath12fe@xmath13 .",
    "if we replace the central fe atom by ni , then the space group is @xmath14 ( space group @xmath15 ) , and the ni atom is at the ( @xmath16 ) wyckoff position , its 8 nearest neighbor fe atoms ( denoted as fe1 ) are on the ( @xmath17 ) wyckoff sites , the 6 second nearest neighbors ( denoted as fe2 ) are on the ( @xmath18 ) wyckoff sites , and the 12 third nearest neighbors ( denoted as fe3 ) are on the ( @xmath19 ) wyckoff sites .",
    "a @xmath20 supercell of a conventional cubic cell of bcc fe , which contains 16 atoms , was also considered and this system is denoted as ni@xmath12fe@xmath21 . the supercell is a simple cubic unit cell , with lattice constant twice that of the bcc structure .",

    "the linearized augmented plane - wave ( lapw ) basis set was expanded using a plane wave with an energy cutoff at 4 ( @xmath32 ) , where @xmath33 is the lattice parameter .",
    "lattice harmonics with @xmath34 were employed to expand the charge density , potential , and wave functions inside each muffin - tin ( mt ) sphere with the radius of 2.20 a.u . for both fe and ni atoms .",
    "the star - function cutoff of @xmath35 ( @xmath32 ) was employed for depicting the charge density and potential in the interstitial region .",
    "the core electrons were treated fully relativistically , and the valence electrons were treated scalar relativistically . to ensure the orthogonality between core and valence states , we employed the explicit orthogonalization ( xo ) method.@xcite self - consistency was assumed when the difference between input and output charge ( spin ) density is less than @xmath36electrons / a.u.@xmath37 the convergence of these computational parameters was carefully checked.@xcite      calculations were carried out on nonmagnetic ( nm ) and ferromagnetic ( fm ) states , to find the optimized lattice constant by fitting the total energy data at various lattice constants to the birch - murnaghan equation of state ( eos),@xcite which also provides the bulk modulus @xmath38 .",

    "it is seen that in the nm states the total energy has a negative curvature around @xmath94 , which is a signature of mechanical instability.@xcite it is further expected that the structure instability will be accompanied by a softening of phonons.@xcite these figures clearly show that when the cubic symmetry of the bcc phase is broken by the tetragonal distortion in the nm state , the total energy is decreasing and indicating a phase transition to the other phase ; fcc in this case .",
    "the total energy is minimized around @xmath95 ( fcc phase ) and become mechanically stable .",
    "this trend can be seen in all these bcc feni systems .",
    "however , the situation was drastically changed when we repeated the same calculations in the fm states . in the fm states , these systems are mechanically stable in the bcc phases and unstable in the fcc phases .",
    "it is possible on the basis of these observations to conclude that the bcc phases are stable in the fm states , and fcc phases in the nm states .",
    "the bcc - fcc phase transition is prohibited by the magnetic contribution to the total energy . if these systems were not magnetic , then one could expect bcc - fcc phase transitions in these bcc feni systems",
    ". this further points out the role of magnetism in the phase stabilities of feni systems , _",
    "i.e. _ , the bcc phases are stabilized by ferromagnetism .",
    "these findings show that magnetism contributes to both structural and elastic stabilities of materials .",
    "nevertheless , magnetism can either stabilize an elastically unstable material , as discussed above , or cause a stable structure to become elastically unstable , _",
    "e.g. _ , hcp fe .",
    "a similar bain transformation path was also observed for bcc - fcc fe where it has been shown that the local minima on the bain path was changed by changing the lattice volume.@xcite therefore , the bain path can be altered slightly by changing the lattice volume .",
    "it is worth to mention how our magnetic model describes the reality of alloy system .",
    "our comparison of the ferromagnetic and nonmagnetic solutions is simply to emphasise the stability of the former state .",
    "the comparison should ideally be between the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic states which we can not easily access .",
    "alloys differ from the corresponding chemical compounds by introducing the concept of atomic thermal aggitation,@xcite which can be interpreted as an ising ferromagnet.@xcite of a given atomic configuration at a finite temperature , the ni impurity modifies the the magnetic moments of neighboring fe atoms . in addition",

    "however , the thermal aggitation will change the atomic configurations dynamically and it will diminish the effects of the rkky and friedel oscillations , by superposition of the random phases of those oscillations . hence , we can expect that the averaged magnetic moments of atoms will not much differ from those of a representative atomic configuration .",
    "although there are good methods for simulating the magnetic moments of disordered states,@xcite the problem of alloy magnetism is still open .",
    "in addition , bcc iron matrix screens well such oscillations of the magnetic moments within the nearest neighbor distance.@xcite therefore , our model should not change the essence of the conclusions , since the ferromagnetic state of iron and its dilute alloys is well - established to be so much more stable than the paramagnetic state .      the observed stability / instability in fcc / bcc phase ultimately have an underlying electronic origin . the electronic structures of these bcc systems and the calculated total electronic density of states ( dos ) per atom at the fermi level ( @xmath96 ) , denoted as @xmath97 , in the nm state",

    "<S> the effects of magnetism on the bain transformation of @xmath0-phase feni systems are investigated by using the full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method based on the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) . </S>",
    "<S> we found that ni impurity in bcc fe increases the lattice constant in ferromagnetic ( fm ) states , but not in the nonmagnetic ( nm ) states . </S>",
    "<S> the shear modulus @xmath1 and young s modulus @xmath2 of bcc fe are also increased by raising the concentration of nickel . </S>",
    "<S> all the compositions considered show high shear anisotropy and the ratio of the bulk to shear modulus is greater than @xmath3 implying ductility . </S>",
    "<S> the mean sound velocities in the @xmath4 $ ] directions are greater than in the @xmath5 $ ] directions . </S>",
    "<S> the bain transformation , which is a component of martensitic transformation , has also been studied to reveal that ni@xmath6fe@xmath7 alloys are elastically unstable in the nm states , but not so in the fm states . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structures explain these results in terms of the density of states at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> it is evident that magnetism can not be neglected when dealing with the bain transformation in iron and its alloys .    * </S>",
