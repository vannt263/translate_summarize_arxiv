    "second , there may be narrow nebular o  vi absorption features superposed on the stellar p  cygni profile , and if the cspn is cooler than 140,000 k , the nebular absorption must originate from an interface layer , requiring the existence of hot interior gas . _",

    "it is possible that some _ fuse _ observations of cspne had one or two off - source apertures falling within the nebula , allowing us to search for o  vi emission from the interface layer .",
    "we have used _ fuse _ observations of the nebular shells of a dozen pne to search for nebular o  vi emission , and analyzed _ fuse _ observations of @xmath1360 cspne to search for narrow nebular o  vi absorption lines in their spectra . each observation is typically composed of multiple spectra .",
    "the individual exposures were processed using the calfuse v3.2.3 @xcite to obtain an extracted spectrum . prior to combining the individual spectra , the relative alignment of each was checked by performing a cross correlation .",

    "we will discuss later in section 4.2 the x - ray peculiarities of ngc2392 .",
    "it has been suggested that the time - scales for the effects of stellar wind shock - heated plasma in pne is short , @xmath575,000 yr @xcite . to investigate the time evolution of the hot bubbles of pne , we have plot in figure  [ hot_bubble ] the x - ray temperature of the pne in our sample with h - rich stellar winds against the radius of their hot bubbles ( top panel ) and the effective temperature of their cspne ( middle panel ) .",
    "the top panel of this figure shows an apparent anti - correlation between the x - ray temperature and hot bubble radius , i.e. , as the hot bubble expands , the x - ray temperature of the plasma seems to decrease .",
    "the comparison of the data points with the theoretical tracks on this plot reveals that we may be comparing pne descending from progenitors of different initial masses .",
    "this is more clearly illustrated in the middle panel plotting @xmath55 against @xmath53 ; pne with more massive central stars produce hotter x - ray - emitting plasma because they reach a high wind power in a short time - scale , when the hot bubble is still small in size .",
    "the plot of x - ray surface brightness ( @xmath44 ) against the star effective temperature , in the bottom panel of figure  [ hot_bubble ] , further supports this conclusion .",
    "the value of @xmath44 does not vary much as the star moves along the horizontal track of the post - agb evolution , but it depends strongly on the mass of the central star .",
    "pne with massive central stars rapidly inject larger amounts of wind mechanical energy into small - sized bubbles , resulting not only in higher plasma temperatures , but also in higher x - ray surface brightnesses .",
    "finally , it is interesting to note the persistent absence of limb - brightening in the spatial distribution of diffuse x - ray emission from hot bubbles of pne ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , the diffuse x - ray emission from ic418 , ngc2392 , and ngc6826 does not show clear evidence for limb - brightening ( fig .",
    "[ img ] ) , suggesting that the x - ray - emitting plasma may fill a significant fraction of the nebular shell .",
    "whereas models of hot bubbles with heat conduction predict a limb - brightened morphology for this diffuse emission , it has been noted that even a small amount of interstellar extinction may reduce significantly the center - to - limb emission contrast because the soft emission from the cooler plasma close to the nebular rim is more easily absorbed than the harder emission from the hotter plasma inwards @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "the spatial distribution of diffuse x - ray emission from pne differs notably from that observed in wind - blown bubbles around wolf - rayet stars , which show distinct limb - brightened morphologies ( e.g. , s308 , * ? ? ?",
    "an inspection of the location of the pne whose _ chandra _ observations are presented in this paper on the different plots shown in fig .",
    "[ comp ] suggests that ic418 and ngc6826 are generally a bit under - luminous , whereas ngc2392 follows the theoretical tracks with the notable exception of its high @xmath8/@xmath52 in fig .",
    "[ comp]-_c_. such peculiar behavior of ngc2392 is confirmed by comparing its values of @xmath8/@xmath52 and @xmath55/@xmath47 to those of the other pne in table  [ fuse_tab ] .",
    "the diffuse x - ray luminosities of these pne comprise just minute fractions of their stellar wind mechanical luminosities ; however , the diffuse x - ray luminosity of ngc2392 constitutes a significant fraction , @xmath410% , of its wind mechanical luminosity . in absolute terms , the x - ray luminosity of ngc2392 exceeds that of many pne in table  [ xpn ] , which is puzzling as the stellar wind of the cspn of ngc2392 has a relatively low mass - loss rate and a meager terminal velocity of 300 km  s@xmath5 .    the plasma temperature of ngc2392 is also puzzling . while the plasma temperatures implied by x - ray spectra of all pne in table  [ xpn ] are lower than the post - shock temperatures of their stellar winds , the observed plasma temperature of ngc2392 is _ higher _ than the post - shock temperature expected from its 300 km  s@xmath5 wind terminal velocity .",
    "the influence of heat conduction is expected to lower significantly the plasma temperature from the post - shock temperature ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ comp]-f ) , which rises with increasing wind velocity , as it is certainly the case for ngc6826 .",
    "however , at low wind speeds , early in the evolution of the hot bubble , the influence of heat conduction on plasma temperature is still small , and therefore the plasma temperature is not expected to differ substantially from the post - shock temperature of an adiabatic shock . yet",
    ", the plasma temperature should not exceed the post - shock temperature .",
    "we conclude that the stellar winds of the pne in our sample are able to power their x - ray - emitting hot gas except for ngc2392 .",
    "a wind terminal velocity higher than 300 km  s@xmath5 is needed for ngc2392 to raise its expected for @xmath8 and @xmath55 .",
    "we note that larger values of the terminal velocity of this wind have been reported by @xcite and @xcite , but @xcite have examined these values and found them not compatible with the p - cygni profiles seen in _ fuse _ observations . considering that an unusual 200 km  s@xmath5 bipolar outflow has been reported in ngc2392 @xcite and that the nebular ionization and expansion velocity are anomalously high",
    ", it is possible that the cspn has a hidden companion and their binary interactions contribute to the energetics of the nebular interior ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mndez et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that a fraction of the diffuse x - rays from ngc2392 was associated with this bipolar outflow , an idea later pursued theoretically by @xcite , but the spatial distribution of the diffuse x - ray emission revealed by _",
    "chandra _ does not support this hypothesis .",
    "future investigations of the cspn of ngc2392 are needed to solve the puzzle of the high x - ray luminosity of its hot interior .",
    "we have obtained _ chandra _ x - ray observations of three pne , ic418 , ngc2392 , and ngc6826 , that display narrow nebular o  vi absorption lines superposed on the _ fuse _ spectra of their cspne .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is detected in each of these three pne within the sharp innermost optical shell .",
    "these detections , together with those in ngc40 , ngc2371 - 2 , ngc6543 , ngc7009 , and ngc7662 , amount to eight known pne with hot ( @xmath58  k ) interior gas in contact with the cool ( @xmath59  k ) nebular shell whose conduction layers have been confirmed by the presence of collisionally produced o  vi .",
    "the physical structure of these pne is thus consistent with that expected from bubble models for h - rich stellar winds including heat conduction @xcite which predict a conduction layer with a steep temperature gradient between the hot interior and the cool nebular shell .",
    "these models also have specific predictions as for the evolution in time of the global x - ray properties of bubble models . to test these predictions ,",
    "we have compiled relevant information on the x - ray , stellar , and nebular properties of pne with a bubble morphology .",
    "the expectations of bubble models including heat conduction compare positively with the present x - ray observations of pne with h - rich stellar winds , but those with h - poor [ wr ] stars present notable discrepancies .",
    "there is an apparent anti - correlation between x - ray temperature and hot bubble radius , but we note that this anti - correlation is cause by differences in stellar masses rather than evolutionary stages : pne with massive central stars are expected to produce hotter x - ray - emitting plasma inside small - sized hot bubbles of higher x - ray surface brightness .",
    "on the other hand , pne with less massive central stars have a slower evolution during the post - agb phase and inject less amounts of mechanical wind luminosities into larger hot bubbles , resulting in cooler x - ray - emitting plasma .",
    "finally , we note that the stellar wind of pne with bubble morphology and hot gas confined in their interiors seems capable of powering their x - ray emission , except for the notable case of ngc2392 . the low speed and small mass - loss rate of its stellar wind result in a low wind mechanical luminosity both in absolute and relative terms compared to other pne .",
    "we suggest that a binary companion may exist and contribute to high energy processes that have provided the additional power to its hot gas .",
