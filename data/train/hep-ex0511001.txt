    "<S> this detection capability at low energy can also be adapted for searches of cold dark matter in the low - mass region as well as to enhance the sensitivities in the study of neutrino magnetic moments .    as - texono/06 - 06 +    </S>",
    "<S> neutrino coherent scattering with the nucleus@xcite @xmath0 is a fundamental neutrino interaction which has never been experimentally observed . </S>",

    "<S> this formula is applicable for @xmath6 where the momentum transfer ( @xmath7 ) is small such that @xmath8 , where r is the nuclear size . </S>",
    "<S> although the cross - section is relatively large due to the @xmath9n@xmath10 enhancement by coherence , the small kinetic energy from nuclear recoils poses severe experimental challenges both to the detector sensitivity and to background control . </S>",
    "<S> various detector techniques have been considered@xcite to meet these challenges .    </S>",
    "<S> measurement of the coherent scattering cross - section would provide a sensitive test to the standard model@xcite , probing the weak nuclear charge and radiative corrections due to possible new physics above the weak scale . </S>",
    "<S> the coherent interaction plays important role in astrophysical processes where the neutrino - electron scatterings are suppressed due to fermi gas degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> it is significant to the neutrino dynamics and energy transport in supernovae and neutron stars@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> being a new detection channel for neutrinos , it may provide new approaches to study other aspects of neutrino physics , such as that for supernova neutrinos@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> coherent scattering with the nuclei is also the detection mechanism adopted in the direct dark matter searches@xcite , such that its observations and measurements with the known particle neutrino is an important milestone . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , neutrino coherent scattering may be a promising avenue towards a compact and relatively transportable neutrino detector , an application of which can be for the real - time monitoring on the operation of nuclear reactors@xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the qf for ge is typically 0.25 in the several kev region , such that the maximum measure - able energy for nuclear recoil events is only about 500  ev .    </S>",
    "<S> `` ultra - low - energy '' germanium ( ulege ) detectors , developed originally for soft x - rays detection , are candidate technologies to meet these challenges of probing into a previously unexplored energy domain@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these detectors typically have modular mass of 5 - 10  grams while detector array of up to n=30 elements have been successfully built . </S>",
