    "subtracting off the fibration of proposition  [ p : sdehn^2 ] from @xmath332 gives the claim .",
    "as the expression of a given element in @xmath4 as a product of commutators is not unique , it is conceivable that the signature of the corresponding lefschetz fibrations might be different for different choices of commutators .",
