    "the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0 ) allows as only known experiment to distinguish between dirac ( neutrinos different from the antiparticles ) and majorana neutrinos ( neutrinos identical with its antiparticles apart of a possible phase ) .",

    "neutrino oscillations give only the differences of the masses squared .",
    "the determination of the masses is possible , if one assumes , that the light left handed majorana neutrino exchange is the leading mechanism for the neutrinoless double beta decay and one is also able to calculate reliably the transition matrix element .",
    "the experimental amplitude called normally @xmath1 is the product of the effective majorana neutrino mass and a transition matrix element @xmath2 . to determine the absolute masses",
    "the matrix element @xmath3 is as important as the data for the @xmath0 transition .",
    "the different methods used to calculate these matrix elements are presented and compared with their advantages and their drawbacks @xcite .",
    "the methods are the quasi - particle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) for spherical ( chapter 2 ) and deformed ( chapter 3 ) nuclei @xcite , the shell model ( sm ) @xcite , the projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( phfb ) approach @xcite and the interacting boson model ( ibm2 )  @xcite .",

    "there the relative phase can test the cp ( combined charge conjugation and parity ) conservation or violation due to relative majorana phases . for cp conservation the strength coefficients",

    "this is only possible for a massive majorana neutrino , which violates helicity conservation and is a @xmath9 mixture of neutrino and antineutrino .",
    "the two emitted electrons violate lepton number conservation .",
    "this is possible due to the lepton and antilepton mixture of the majorana neutrino . ]",
    "in addition to the light left handed majorana neutrino exchange , one has other possible mechanisms as cause for the neutrinoless double beta decay : grand unification ( gut ) , supersymmerty ( susy ) and extensions to extra dimensions .",

    "this allows at each vertex in figure [ neutrinoless1 ] left and right handed interactions and one handedness at the leptonic , electron - neutrino side and an other handedness at the hadronic , neutron - proton side inside each four - vertex . in addition one has susy contributions , where mainly the threelinear terms are responsible for the lepton number violation @xcite .",

    "if one wants to determine the effective light left handed majorana neutrino mass from the neutrinoless double beta decay , one assumes that this is the leading term and one can neglect the rest .",
    "but one needs apart of the data a reliable value for the matrix element . in the second chapter",
    "we will compare the different methods to calculate these matrix elements .",
    "the groups in tbingen , bratislava and jyvskyl  @xcite are using mainly the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) , while the strasbourg - madrid group  @xcite uses the shell model ( sm ) , tomoda , faessler , schmid and gruemmer  @xcite and rath and coworkers  @xcite use the angular momentum projected hartree - fock - bogoliubov method ( hfb ) ( see the correction for the missing factor 2 in the work of pradfulla rath et al . in @xcite . ) , and barea and iachello  @xcite use the interacting boson model ( ibm2 , which distinguishes between protons and neutrons ) .",
    "the qrpa  @xcite has the advantage to allow to use a large single - particle basis .",
    "thus , one is able to include to each single nucleon state in the qrpa model space also the spin - orbit partner , which guarantees that the ikeda sum rule  @xcite is fulfilled .",
    "this is essential to describe correctly the gamow - teller strength .",
    "the sm  @xcite is presently still restricted to a nuclear basis of four to five single - particle levels for the description of the neutrinoless double beta decay . therefore , not all spin - orbit partners can be included and , as a result , the ikeda sum rule is violated by 34 to 50% depending on the single particle basis used . on the other side ,",
    "the shell model can in principle take into account all many - body configurations in a given single - particle basis .",
    "the excited states in the qrpa for spherical even - mass nuclei include ` seniority ' ( the number of broken quasiparticles ) states two , six , ten ,  and for the ground state correlations ` seniority ' zero , four , eight ,  configurations .",
    "the sm takes for the ground state seniority zero , four , six , eight ,  , and for the excited states seniority two , four , six ,  into account .",
    "but the numerical results of the shell model show @xcite , that in agreement with the philosophy of rpa the contributions of seniority 6 configurations are small and can be neglected @xcite . in qrpa one",
    "starts from the transformation to bogoliubov quasiparticles :    @xmath17    the creation @xmath18 and annihilation operators of time reversed single - particle states @xmath19 are usually defined with respect to oscillator wave functions  @xcite .",
    "the single - particle energies are calculated with a woods saxon potential  @xcite .",
    "the single - particle basis can include up to 23 nucleon levels ( all single - particle states without a core up to the @xmath20 level and even much larger , if deformation is allowed @xcite ) for the protons and also for the neutrons .",
    "but the qrpa results for the @xmath0 matrix elements turn out to be stable as a function of the basis size already for smaller basis sets ( from 6 or 7 levels and larger , respectively ) in lighter systems .",
    "the excited states @xmath21 with angular momentum @xmath22 in the intermediate odd - odd mass nucleus are created from the correlated initial and final @xmath23 ground states by a proton - neutron phonon creation operator : @xmath24 @xmath25 , \\label{q}\\ ] ] which is defined as a linear superposition of creation operators of proton - neutron quasiparticle pairs : @xmath26_{j m } , \\label{bcs0}\\ ] ]    for the present presentation the complication of angular momentum coupling , which must and is included in the quantitative calculations , is not shown .",
    "the inverse @xmath0 lifetime for the light majorana neutrino exchange mechanism is given as the product of three factors , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a calculable phase space factor , @xmath2 is the @xmath0 nuclear matrix element , and @xmath29 is the ( nucleus - independent ) `` effective majorana neutrino mass '' ( [ majorana ] ) .",
    "the expressions for the matrix elements @xmath14 and the corresponding @xmath0 transition operators are given , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath30       the sm approach has been applied by the strasbourg - madrid group  @xcite to neutrinoless double beta decay  @xcite using the closure relation with an averaged energy denominator . in this way",
    "one does not need to calculate the states in the odd - odd intermediate nuclei .",
    "the quality of the results depends then on the description of the @xmath23 ground states in the initial and final nuclei of the double beta decay system , e.g. @xmath31ge @xmath32se , on the nucleon - nucleon interaction matrix elements fitted by the oslo group in neighbouring muclei and on the average energy denominator chosen ( fitted ) for closure .",
    "the @xmath0 transition matrix element ( [ mnu ] ) simplifies as shown in equations ( 5 ) to ( 11 ) of ref .  @xcite .",
    "since the number of many body configurations is increasing drastically with the single - particle basis , one is forced to restrict for mass numbers @xmath33 and @xmath34 in the sm the single - particle basis to @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the @xmath37se nucleus is calculated in the sm for five basis single - particle levels including also @xmath38 . for the mass region around @xmath39 the sm basis is restricted to @xmath40 and @xmath41 levels .",
    "the problem with these small basis sets is that the spin - orbit partners @xmath38 and @xmath42 have to be omitted  @xcite .",
    "the sm results then automatically violate the ikeda sum rule ( isr )  @xcite , while the qrpa satisfies it exactly .",
    "the ikeda sum rule is : @xmath43 @xmath44 [ \\sum_{l}^{a } \\sigma_{\\mu}(l ) t_{-}(l ) ] |0^{+}_i \\rangle , \\label{s}\\ ] ] for @xmath45 the subscripts at the isospin rising and lowering operators are exchanged .",

    "@xcite ) on @xmath48 decay and , since 2008 , also on @xmath0 decay , in which they used a simple pairing plus quadrupole many body hamiltonian of the kumar and baranger type  @xcite to calculate the neutrinoless double beta decay transition matrix elements with angular momentum projection from a hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) wave function after variation .",
    "schmid  @xcite did show , that with the assumption of a real bogoliubov transformation ( real coefficient a and b ) , axial symmetry    @xmath49    and no parity mixing , only @xmath50 nucleon pairs and excited states are allowed ( see eqn .",

    "figure [ hfb - fig ] shows on the other side , that the projected hfb approach is restricted to contributions of neutron pairs with angular momenta @xmath51 .",
    "in addition , one sees that the contributions of transition of higher angular momentum neutron to proton pairs @xmath52 are drastically reduced compared to the qrpa and the sm see fig .",
    "[ hfb - fig ] .",
    "the reason for this is obvious : in a spherical nucleus the hfb solution contains only seniority zero and no stronger higher angular momentum pairs .",
    "the double beta decay system @xmath53 has only small deformations and thus a projected hfb state is not able to describe an appreciable admixture of higher angular momentum pairs for @xmath54 transitions as can be seen in ref .",
    "the higher angular momentum contributions increase drastically with increasing intrinsic quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations of the hfb solution .",
    "+ the results in figure  [ hfb - fig ] are calculated in.tuebingen by k.w .",
    "schmid  @xcite within the hfb with angular momentum and particle number projection before variation with an improved gogny force  @xcite adjusted in a global fit to properties of many nuclei .    to have also @xmath55 neutron pairs contributing one has to use a bogoliubov transformation with complex coefficients a and b ( [ bogo ] ) .",
    "to have also @xmath56 one has to allow parity mixing in the bogoliubov transformation ( [ bogo ] ) .",
    "but even allowing all different types of angular momentum and parity pairs one would still have an unnatural suppression of the higher angular momenta especially for smaller deformations .",
    "this handicap could probably be overcome by a multi - configuration hfb wave function @xcite with complex coefficients and parity mixing in the bogoliubov ( [ bogo ] ) transformation .",
    "the ibm ( interacting boson model )  @xcite can only change @xmath57 ( s ) and @xmath58 ( d ) fermionic pairs from two neutrons into two protons . in the bosonization to higher orders",
    "this leads to the creation and annihilation of up to three `` s '' and `` d '' boson annihilation and creation operators in ref .",
