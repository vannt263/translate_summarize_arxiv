    "the quasi - one - dimensional spin chain and ladder ( la , y , sr , ca)@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 compounds have attracted considerable interest since the discovery of a quantum critical phase transition in their phase diagram.@xcite these compounds are the first superconducting copper oxide materials with a non - square lattice .",

    "this finding is in agreement with the insulating behavior of the ladders @xcite and points out the need of including the full af crystal structure in the simulation .",
    "the occurrence of a 0.25  ev hubbard gap in ladder states results in a strong hole depletion of this sub - system .",
    "indeed , we find that only about 0.4 holes reside in ladders , while the chains accommodate about 5.3 holes per @xmath6 . a more detailed analysis of hole distribution is presented in table  [ proba ] .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,>,^,^,^ \" , ]     the role of correlations is even more evident when analyzing hole and spin order along the chains in the paramagnetic dft calculations and in the dft including u and af ordering .",
    "when correlation effects are switched - on the number of holes in the ladder is decreased by a factor of five .",
    "_ hole - depletion of ladders is thus a pure correlation effect_.    the distribution of more than 5 holes in chains and less than 1 in ladders is compatible not only with the af unit cell with 5-fold chain periodicity , but also with the af model with 4-fold chain periodicity.@xcite but the latter model turns out to be irrelevant since in this case the nexafs calculations could not reproduce the experimental data ( see sect.[sec : nexcalc ] ) . moreover , the 4-fold chain - spin periodicity destroys the natural 5-fold hole ordering , while the 5-fold spin periodicity preserves it , as shown in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "we would like to stress once more that taking into account the proper long - range af order is crucial to achieve a correct description of o k - edge nexafs spectra .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that our dos is in good agreement with experiments as we find the occurrence of a strong -2  ev band with mixed chain / ladder contributions and large cu - ladder weight , in accordance with angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements.@xcite furthermore the two ladder - dos structures at -0.25  ev and -0.1  ev have also been observed in a recent arpes @xcite experiment and were identified as the quasi-1d underlying fermi surface .",
    "finally , the tendency of hole - depleting ladder - rungs found in our work , provides a satisfactory explation for the 2d to 1d cross - over when the number of holes in the system is reduced , like in under - doped compounds@xcite or at low temperature where the less localized ladder sub - system suffers from the migration of holes to chains ( back - transfer ) as reported in the nmr.@xcite on the fully doped side we suggest that the ca doping has a twofold effect : it destroys long - range af order in chains @xcite and reduces hole - depletion in ladders .",
    "increased population of the rung sites reinforces the 2d character of the ladders . for sufficient ca - induced ladder - doping the cdw ground state",
    "is then suppressed in favor of the 2d superconductivity under pressure.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , our experimental nexafs spectra and first - principles theoretical modeling including the complete 316 atom af unit cell , core - hole and correlation effects demonstrate that holes mainly reside on chains and thus ladders are hole - depleted .",
    "this finding resolves long standing controversial interpetations by several authors based on semi - empirical models .",
    "the analysis by ncker et al.@xcite is in agreement with our findings based on an @xmath30-@xmath31 approach .",
    "it is clear , however , that their arguments were based on a too limited description since correlations and long range af behavior consisting of a 5-fold chain periodicity must be included to obtain the corrrect interpretation of the experimental spectra .    in ladders ,",
    "majority of holes reside in leg sites , while only a tiny minority populates rung sites .",
    "further experiments and calculations are under consideration to verify our suggestion that the small affinity of rung sites in the parent compound explains the 1d - 2d cross - over going from the under - doped to the fully doped side in the phase diagram of ( la , y , sr , ca)@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
