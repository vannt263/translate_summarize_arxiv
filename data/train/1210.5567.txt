    "quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in high - energy heavy - ion collisions behaves like a perfect fluid .",
    "energetic partons created through initial hard scatterings are subject to lose their energy during traversing the qgp medium , which is called jet quenching @xcite .",
    "thus the jet quenching phenomenon is a promising tool to extract information about stopping power of the qgp .",
    "these partons could induce collective flow in the qgp by depositing energy and momentum .",
    "in fact , the cms collaboration observed a large number of low momentum hadrons at large angles from a quenched jet @xcite .",
    "the sum of these low momentum hadrons together with a quenched jet balances that of the momentum of a jet created at the same position and propagating in the opposite direction .",
    "therefore the result can be interpreted as manifestation of a wake of the qgp fluid by the jet quenching .    in this paper",
    ", we construct a relativistic hydrodynamic model to demonstrate a response of the qgp fluid to jet propagation through it .",
    "we model a source term in relativistic hydrodynamic equations which exhibits deposit of the energy and momentum from traversing jets . without linearisation",
    "we solve these non - linear hydrodynamic equations numerically in full ( 3 + 1)-dimensional space and describe responses of expanding qgp medium to propagation of energetic jets .",
    "to study the dynamics of the qgp fluid induced by jets , we use relativistic hydrodynamic equations with source terms @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the energy - momentum tensor of the qgp perfect fluid and @xmath2 is the density of the four momentum deposited from the traversing jets .",
    "we employ massless ideal gas equation of state , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are energy density and pressure , respectively .",
    "we assume that the deposited energy and momentum are instantaneously thermalised inside a fluid cell . for simplicity , we consider collisional energy loss only .",
    "when a massless jet partcle travels through the qgp fluid , the source term is given by @xmath6 we solve eq .",
    "@xmath7[eqn : hydro_source]@xmath8 numerically without linearisation for a given initial condition . in this way",
    ", we describe collective flow induced by jets on top of an expanding background qgp fluid in high - energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "particle distributions can be calculated using cooper - frye formula @xcite in an isochronous hypersurface in the calculation frame .",
    "we consider two different situations . as a test case , we consider one jet particle traveling through a uniform fluid . as a more realistic case , we consider a pair of jets traveling in opposite directions through an _ expanding _ fluid .",
    "we assume that jet particles are massless and travel in a straight line .",
    "figure [ fig : mach ] shows the energy density distribution and the flow velocity field of the qgp fluid in a plane including a jet axis at a fixed time @xmath9 fm/@xmath10 .",
    "initial energy density of the fluid is @xmath11 .",
    "fm/@xmath10.,width=377 ]    the jet particle starts its propagation in the @xmath12-direction at the speed of light from the origin at @xmath13 fm/@xmath10 .",
    "one sees the so - called mach cone , namely a ",
    "v - shaped \" cone - like structure of higher energy density region in three dimensional space .",
    "the jet particle is followed by a strong collective flow in the positive @xmath12 direction , which leads to lower energy density behind the cone than that of the backgrounds .",
    "notice here that the background energy density is @xmath14 . on the surface of the cone , flow velocity is nearly perpendicular to the surface . behind the cone",
    ", one sees vortices around @xmath15 fm , @xmath16 fm ) which form a vortex ring around the path of the jet in three dimensional space .",
    "next , we consider a pair of jets traveling through a qgp fluid which expands radially .",
    "initial energy density distribution is @xmath17 here , we choose @xmath18 gev , @xmath19 fm and @xmath20 fm . without jets ,",
    "this fluid expands isotropically .",
    "a pair of jets is supposed to be created at @xmath21 with the common initial energy @xmath22 , both of which are traveling in the opposite direction .",
    "one jet goes in the positive @xmath12 direction and is observed as a leading jet .",
    "the other goes in the negative @xmath12 direction , loses more energy and is observed as a sub - leading jet .    to see the momentum acquired by the qgp fluid from the jets , we calculate total momentum distribution as a function of polar angle measured from the leading jet axis subtracted by the distribution in the case without jet propagation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the polar angle , @xmath25 the momentum of the particle from the fluid and @xmath26 the index of the momentum regions .",
    "summation of the particles is taken over in the three different momentum regions such as  @xmath27 \" ( @xmath28 ) ,  @xmath29 \" ( @xmath30 ) and  @xmath31 \" ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "we calculate eq .  ( [ eq : mom - dist ] ) through the cooper - frye formula and do not add final jets momentum : @xmath33    \" ( @xmath28 ) ,",
    " @xmath29 \" ( @xmath30 ) and  @xmath31 \" ( @xmath32 ) , respectively . ,",
    "width=302 ]    figure [ fig : momentum ] shows @xmath34 as a function of @xmath35 for three different momentum regions .",
    "note that @xmath36 corresponds to the direction of the sub - leading jet .",
    "a single prominent peak appears in this direction for each momentum region and no additional peak away from the direction of the sub - leading jet , which is expected from the mach - cone structure , is seen . at large angles from the sub - leading jet @xmath37 , low momentum particles are dominant",
    "this result is qualitatively consistent with the cms data @xcite and indicates importance of medium responses to jet propagation to understand the modification of jet structure .",
    "in this paper , we studied the dynamics of the qgp fluid induced by jet propagation .",
    "we constructed a qgp - fluid+jet model and performed two simulations . in the case of one jet traveling through a uniform fluid , a mach cone appears in the energy density distribution and a vortex ring is formed around the path of the jet behind the cone . in the case of a pair of jets traveling through an expanding fluid , we showed that low momentum particles are dominant at large angles from the subleading jet .",
    "these results indicate that the qgp - fluid+jet model describes the cms data @xcite qualitatively and importance of the qgp medium responses to the jet propagation .",
