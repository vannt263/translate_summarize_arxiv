    "in an optical medium , the envelope of a light pulse travels at a group velocity @xmath0 , which is defined as the reciprocal slope of the dispersion relation for the medium .",
    "recent advances in controlling the dispersive properties have enabled superluminal or negative group velocities @xcite , extremely slow group velocities @xcite , and even stopping light pulses @xcite .    in a classical textbook @xcite ,",
    "brillouin pointed out that the group velocity can exceed the light speed @xmath1 in a vacuum and such a superluminal phenomenon does not conflict with causality .",
    "however , even after several experimental demonstrations @xcite , the superluminal light propagation has still invited some misunderstandings , because it is very counterintuitive that a light pulse runs faster than @xmath1 .",
    "recently we have proposed an electronic circuit which exhibits negative group delays .",
    "it produces an output pulse ahead of the input pulse @xcite .",
    "this circuit shares the same principle as light propagation at superluminal or negative group velocities .",
    "the circuit is so simple that one can easily build it and examine how this puzzling phenomenon takes place .",
    "extremely slow light has been realized by utilizing electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite . in the eit experiments ,",
    "probe light and control light are tuned to a common excited level of @xmath2-type three - level atoms .",
    "the two light beams destructively interfere with each other through the common upper level and the light absorption disappears .",
    "the refractive index for the probe light , as well as the absorption coefficient , varies largely within very narrow bandwidth , called a `` transparency window , '' where the absorption is vanished .",
    "hence in the presence of the control light , the group velocity of the probe light becomes extremely small , compared with @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite succeeded in reducing the group velocity down to @xmath3 in laser - cooled atomic gas .",
    "they prepared a single - shot pulse with the duration of @xmath4 and the pulse length of @xmath5 in a vacuum , and fed it into the eit medium .",
    "owing to the slow down , the pulse length was compressed into @xmath6 in the medium .",
    "the group velocity is proportional to the width of the transparency window , which is determined by the intensity of the control light ; the weaker the control light , the smaller the group velocity .",
    "however , we can not slow down the probe pulse unconditionally",
    ". the lower limit of the group velocity is given by the condition that the transparency window should be wider than the bandwidth of the probe pulse .",
    "otherwise the pulse shape would be deformed by the absorption .",
    "this condition is often called the eit condition",
    ".    this limitation can be overcome by changing the intensity of the control light when the probe pulse is traveling in the eit medium @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the control light is kept constant until the entire probe pulse fits into the eit medium .",
    "subsequently the control light is turned down smoothly , and the probe pulse is slowed down with its spatial profile unchanged . the pulse is stopped in the medium when the control light is eventually turned off . during the stopping process , the spectral width of the probe pulse is compressed and can be fitted in the transparency window , which narrows down according to the dimming of control light .",
    "the stopped pulse can be restarted by restoring the control light .",
    "the released pulse is identical with the original one , because all the processes , freezing and releasing , are carried out coherently . the characteristics of light pulses , such as the amplitude , phase , and beam profile , can be stored .",
    "even the quantum state of light could be stored in the medium , and this method is promising as a quantum memory .",
    "this paper deals with the physics of the slow and stopped light , and introduces a circuit which simulates the light propagation with velocity control .",
    "this circuit model is very clear and instructive as that for the superluminal propagation .",
    "moreover it is easy to construct the circuits and change the circuit parameters freely .",
    "we can set the time constant slow enough that the propagation can be seen as blinks of a series of light emitting diodes ( leds ) , which monitor the output of each stage .",
    "the circuit behaves like a running message display of single row but the operation principle is quite different .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] we give a theoretical framework of pulse propagation in dispersive media and introduce the circuit for the simulation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] we show several experimental results , which correspond to slow light or stopped light experiments , and summary is given in sec .",

    "in a medium , the wave equation in one dimension with respect to the electric field , @xmath7 , is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the polarization of the medium induced by the electric field .",

    ", @xmath34 is equal to the rabi frequency of the control light @xmath40 , which is proportional to the amplitude of the control light @xcite .",
    "the width @xmath34 can be effectively reduced down to the atomic decoherence rate , which can be @xmath41 or even smaller .",
    "therefore the extremely slow velocity , @xmath42 , or virtual stopping can be possible .",
    "the spectrum of the pulse must be contained within the eit window .",
    "namely , the spectral width @xmath19 of the envelope must satisfy the condition : @xmath43 this linkage between the group velocity and the bandwidth condition is a very important issue in slow light experiments .",
    "a similar restriction comes into play in cases of superluminal or negative group velocities @xcite .      if @xmath0 is constant in time and space , it is easy to show that the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : envelope ] ) is @xmath44 .",
    "this means that the envelope propagates in the medium at the group velocity @xmath0 , keeping its shape .",

    "( [ eq : envelope ] ) can be written as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the boundary condition at @xmath48 .",

    "this is the reason why the pulse length is compressed when the light pulse is fed from the vacuum into the eit medium .",
