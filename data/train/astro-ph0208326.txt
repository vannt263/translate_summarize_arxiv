    "direct detection of supersymmetric wimp dark matter in the coming decade appears possible . as shown in fig .",
    "[ limitplot ] , experiments under construction should probe a large fraction of parameter space allowed by minimal supersymmetric theory and experimental constraints  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , if the sign of @xmath2 , the higgs mixing parameter in the superpotential , is positive , the wimp mass must be @xmath3  , and the wimp - nucleon cross section must be @xmath4  pb  @xcite , possibly making the entire parameter space accessible to a ton - scale wimp - detection experiment .",
    "cryoarray would be a 1-ton deployment of semiconductor cryogenic detectors , of a type similar to that in use in cdms ii  @xcite .",
    "this experiment would be sensitive to a wimp - nucleon cross section @xmath5  pb , corresponding to a signal of a few wimp interactions per 100  kg years .",
    "the detectors of cdms or cryoarray measure phonons and charge carriers separately for each interaction in order to allow rejection of the otherwise dominant electron - recoil background events . the background discrimination of these detectors has already been demonstrated to be so good  @xcite that instrumenting a one - ton detector is fully justified .",
    "below , we review in detail the expected performance of cryoarray , and conclude with a short discussion of the challenge to build such an experiment at a reasonable cost .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , > , > , < , > , > , > , > , < \" , ]     [ backgrounds ]",
    "table  [ backgrounds ] lists photon , electron , and neutron background event rates in the energy range 1545  kev for actual exposures of cdms  i  @xcite and cdms  ii at stanford  @xcite , and for projections for cdms  ii at soudan and for cryoarray .",
    "the goals of cryoarray reflect a factor 20 improvement in backgrounds , and a factor 10 improvement in electron discrimination , over the goals for cdms  ii .",
    "the low - energy threshold is at 15  kev ( rather than 5 or 10  kev ) to avoid the contributions of the cosmogenic activation peaks and tritium beta spectrum in ge near 10  kev .",
    "the first columns of the table show the radioactivity event rates and the total numbers of events expected during the tabulated exposures .",
    "the other columns show how event - by - event discrimination can be used not only to reject most of the background , but also to subtract part of the residual background if the detector response is well enough understood  @xcite .",
    "the results of this background subtraction include the effects of a 5% systematic uncertainty in the detector discrimination .",
    "a muon veto provides the neutron rejection ( see section  [ neutrons ] ) .",
    "however , the neutron subtraction is performed based on the observed population of multiple - detector neutron events .      as shown in fig .",
    "[ discrimination ] , the original cdms  ii and cryoarray goals  @xcite for rejection of photons have already been exceeded . based on the demonstrated rejection",
    ", the original photon - background goal for cdms  ii ( 15 events after subtraction ) has already been met , even without the expected 3@xmath6 reduction in rate from increasing the experiment s depth .",
    "furthermore , the rejection efficiencies in table  [ backgrounds ] are statistically limited lower limits . and are probably overly conservative .    based on the demonstrated rejection , cryoarray s post - subtraction background goal for photons is achievable merely by reducing the raw photon rate to 13  mdru , only @xmath7 lower than that currently achieved by igex  @xcite in hpge detectors in the same energy range .",
    "this modest improvement is expected due to the increased detector self - shielding and multiple - scatter rejection from increased mass and many detectors .",
    "the beta electron background represents a greater challenge .",
    "the current observed background rate for cdms  ii at suf is 80  mdru , @xmath8 above the cdms  ii soudan goal of 20  mdru .",
    "some of the current beta contamination may be due to exposure of the detectors to a leaking calibration source during testing .",
    "use of such sources has been restricted . moving to the deeper site at soudan",
    "will remove essentially all cosmogenically produced betas , potentially the dominant beta background .",
    "furthermore , the discrimination performance of the new detectors ( see fig .  [ discrimination]b ) may well be sufficient even if cdms  ii does not reach the absolute beta background goal .    for cryoarray ,",
    "self - shielding will eliminate the beta backgrounds from materials surrounding the detector stacks .",
    "nevertheless , improving the beta background by a further factor of 20 will require sensitive screening of the detectors and nearby materials .",
    "while screening to the required level of @xmath9  counts  kev@xmath10  m@xmath11  day@xmath10 for betas with @xmath12  kev appears achievable  @xcite , cleaning the materials may require new techniques .",
    "improving the electron discrimination to 99.5% appears achievable through improvements of the signal - to - noise of the detectors .",
    "% efficient , limited by statistics .",
    "( b ) applying a cut based on phonon risetimes can remove @xmath13% of the low - ionization - yield events ( mostly electrons ) while keeping @xmath14% of the neutron events . ]",
    "the low - energy ( @xmath1510  mev ) neutrons from @xmath16,n ) and fission processes in the rock are trivially stopped by hydrogenous shielding .",
    "such shielding reduces the low - energy neutron flux by @xmath1710@xmath6 per 10  cm of material , so 70  cm of such shielding should make this neutron flux negligible .",
    "other neutrons arise from muons interacting inside the experiment s shielding or in the cavern rock .",
    "the former can be tagged using a local active muon veto directly around the passive shielding .",
    "a muon veto efficiency of 80% is adequate at soudan ( 2080 mwe ) to ensure that these `` shield '' neutrons contribute negligibly to the cdms  ii background .",
    "the demonstrated cdms  ii muon veto efficiency of 99.95% would even be sufficient to limit this neutron background to a small enough rate at soudan for cryoarray .",
    "a deeper site such as gran sasso ( at @xmath174  kmwe ) would reduce the neutron flux by @xmath1725@xmath6 , making the muon - veto requirement very modest .",
    "the high - energy neutrons generated in the cavern rock by spallation processes of high - energy muons are difficult both to veto and to stop . with the cdms ii polyethylene shielding sandwiching pb shielding , @xmath178 secondary neutrons from these `` punch - through '' neutrons should scatter in single detectors during the 2500 kg - day exposure , based on extensive monte carlo studies  @xcite .    because this neutron flux for deep sites is approximately proportional to the muon flux  @xcite , increased depth is the easiest way to reduce this neutron background .",
    "siting cryoarray at a depth of 4  kmwe would likely reduce this background sufficiently , while siting it at 7  kmwe should essentially remove this background .",
    "if the experiment were sited at @xmath18  mwe ( e.g. wipp or soudan ) , either a much thicker liquid - scintillator buffer would be required around the detector in order to tag high - energy neutrons , or the cavern rock itself ( or an outer heavy shield ) would need to be instrumented with additional veto detectors in order to catch some part of the shower associated with the muon that generated the neutron .",
    "cryoarray should work well enough to probe wimp - nucleon cross sections @xmath0  pb once it is built . the most significant challenge at this point is determining how to build it at a reasonable cost .",
    "for cdms  ii , the 42 detectors are being built using university facilities and technicians under the close supervision of cdms physicists .",
    "detectors are tested at least twice in batches of @xmath19 in university dilution refrigerators .",
    "this time - consuming and physicist - intensive procedure is not practical for cryoarray s @xmath17 5002000 detectors .",
    "an industrial approach is needed .    in",
    "order to `` out - source '' this effort , we will need to engineer and specify a stable and reliable high - yield process .",
    "since it is not feasible to test each individual module prior to deployment in the array , the yield must be 90% .",
    "this goal is ambitious ; current detector yields are @xmath1750% .",
    "we expect to continue to make gains in understanding pathologies in the processing steps during the remaining cdms  ii construction period , which is scheduled for completion at the end of 2003 . in 12 years",
    "we will have substantially more experience in fabricating and operating cdms detectors .",
    "the knowledge gained will be essential for establishing a realistic plan for building cryoarray and assessing its likely performance",
    ". this knowledge will likely point the way to additional laboratory work to be carried out before a full - scale proposal is considered .",
