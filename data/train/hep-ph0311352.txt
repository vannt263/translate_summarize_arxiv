    ".    the notations in the figure are standard . however , the overall mass scale is not known .",
    "we only have upper bounds of @xmath1ev from wmap @xcite and @xmath2ev from tritium end point experiments @xcite .",
    "if neutrinos have majorana masses then a better limit of @xmath3 ev comes from neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath4 experiments @xcite .",
    "this latter result is model dependent and is subject to uncertainties in nuclear matrix element calculations as well as the implicit assumption that neutrino mass is the dominant effect leading to the decay .",
    "there are many excellent reviews on these are other questions we list the most recent ones in @xcite .    as with other fermions when neutrinos are massive their mass eigenstates and weak eigenstates do not coincide . in general",
    "they are related via a mixing matrix @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "analysis of the data yield u_pmns&= & (    ccc u_e1&u_e2&u_e3 + u_1&u_2&u_3 + u_1&u_2&u_3    ) + & = & (    ccc0.79 - 0.86&0.50 - 0.61&.0 - 0.16 + 0.24 - 0.52&0.44 - 0.69&0.63 - 0.79 + 0.26 - 0.52&0.47 - 0.71&0.60 - 0.77    ) .",
    "[ eq : mns ] in a gauge theory @xmath5 is a product of two mixing matrices : u_pmns = u_l u _ where @xmath6 diagonalizes the charged lepton mass matrix and @xmath7 does the same for neutrinos .",
    "often one chooses the mass eigenbasis for the charged leptons and @xmath5 is just the neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "furthermore , eq.([eq : mns ] ) is a low energy solution .",
    "it is typical that gauge models are formulated at some high energy scale and reach the above via renormalization group running . whether this has a large effect is highly model dependent . in most of our discussions",
    "we assume that this is not large .",
    "now we return to the mixing matrix .",
    "it is clear that , unlike the down quark mixing , neutrino mixing are bilarge and the recent sno data also rule out bi - maximal .",
    "one can reconstruct the neutrino mass matrix in the weak basis @xmath8 via @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the diagonal mass matrix with eigenvalues @xmath11 .",
    "it is @xmath12 that is of the greatest interest to theorists . in general @xmath13",
    "are complex numbers for majorana neutrinos . customarily one phase is put into @xmath5 and two are left in @xmath10 . with the values of mass differences depicted in fig . 1 and eq . ( [ eq : mns ] ) the leading mass patterns are given by    imh    _ ~m_0 ( 1 & & + & 1/2&1/2 + & 1/2&1/2 )    _ ~m_0 ( & 1&1 + 1 & & + 1 & & )    nmh _",
    "~m_0 ( & & + & 1/2&-1/2 + & -1/2&1/2 ) where @xmath14 is the unknown overall mass scale and @xmath15 denotes some small number .",
    "the challenge to theorists is to construct viable models that give rise to one of the above structures . at the same time one",
    "gets a more or less natural understanding of why the overall neutrino mass scale is so much smaller than the charged fermions ; i.e. what physics sets the scale of neutrino masses .",
    "the strong evidence of neutrino oscillations and mixing has certainly shattered the concept of separately conserved electron , muon or tau lepton number ; however , the question of whether total lepton number is conserved is still open . the usual way of stating this is in terms of whether neutrinos are dirac or majorana particle . if neutrinos were majorana then they are own anti - particle and lepton number violating reactions can be expected to proceed .",
    "otherwise they are dirac particles .",
    "experimentally this is a very difficult question to answer .",
    "the favorite process is @xmath4 decays .",
    "if one such decay were observed then it will be clear evidence that lepton number is not conserved and it will natural to conclude that neutrinos are majorana or at least a majorana mass term is not forbidden",
    ". on the other hand to prove that neutrinos are dirac particles will be very difficult .",
    "the nature of neutrinos has deep theoretical significance is modern particle physics .",
    "the active neutrino in the sm is a left - handed weyl particle ; i.e. is a helicity eigenstate . due to gauge invariance",
    "it has no bare mass term . to give it a mass one",
    "usually introduces a right - handed fermion @xmath16 which is a sm singlet .",
    "whether the @xmath16 exists and what is its nature are two of the most fundamental question in neutrino physics . certainly if @xmath16 exists how many are there ?",
    "what is its mass ? is it dirac or majorana particle ? in the sm this is put in by hand and so the same is true @xmath17 gut models .",
    "it is customary to use at least one to generate masses for some of the active neutrinos and three if we believe in some family symmetry . in @xmath18 gut models",
    "@xmath16 naturally exists since the fundamental representation has 16 fermions which is just the right number to accommodate each sm family plus a @xmath16 .",
    "here it is natural to have three of them .",
    "there are many theoretical reasons to pursue gut models and understand neutrino masses in this context ( see @xcite for an up to date review ) ; moreover , we wish to study this in a wider setting .",
    "as is well known @xmath16 being a singlet can have a majorana mass term , @xmath19 as well as a dirac mass term coupling given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the sm higgs boson and @xmath22 is the yukawa coupling .",
    "after symmetry breaking the neutrino masses for one family is given by ( |_l^c & |n_r^c ) ( m_&m_d + m_d^t & m_r ) ( _",
    "l + n_r ) [ eq : nummatrix ] for three families each entry in the above is a @xmath23 matrix .    in the sm @xmath24 and @xmath25 gev . if @xmath16 is a dirac fermion then @xmath26 and we have dirac masses for the active neutrinos .",
    "this is the simplest extension of the sm . in this case",
    "it is very difficult to understand the smallness of the neutrino masses and extreme fine tuning of the yukawa coupling @xmath27 to get it below the experimental bound . in gut models",
    "it is natural to take @xmath28 gev and we have the seesaw mechanism for generating neutrino masses .",
    "recently new perspectives in neutrino physics arise from the so call brane world scenario . in the simplest form",
    "this makes use of the possibility that there are more then 4 dimensions . the number of extra dimensions @xmath29 is between 1 and 7 as hinted by string theory .",
    "they are taken to be spatial and can be relatively large @xcite which enables one to solve the hierarchy problem .",
    "fields with sm quantum numbers are confined on a @xmath30 hyper surface whereas sm singlets such as the graviton can propagate in the full @xmath31 dimensional bulk .",
    "the extra dimensions are compactified in tori of radii @xmath32 where @xmath33 . introducing @xmath16 as a bulk field",
    "was done in @xcite .",
    "as is well known compactification leads to 4d kaluza - klein(kk ) excitations of @xmath16 with masses @xmath34 where we have taken all radii to be equal .",
    "the zero mode can now couple to the active neutrino on the brane and the sm higgs in the usual way .",
    "if @xmath16 is taken to be dirac then a small dirac neutrino mass can be generated given by m_d= v=245 without excessive fine tuning of @xmath22 .",
    "this is due to the volume dilution factor of @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fundamental scale for the theory we can obtain @xmath37ev .",
    "even with this simple model and only one family there is an important consequence for neutrino oscillation .",
    "the kk excitations form an infinite tower of sterile neutrinos .",
    "one would expect an effective active - sterile oscillation @xcitein the superk data .",
    "however , there is no evidence in the data .",
    "this may indicate that the mixing between the active neutrinos and the kk modes are small and/or @xmath38 can not be taken too large .",
    "other effects in nuclear and astrophysics of this simple model are discussed in @xcite .",
    "we have seen that small dirac neutrino masses are quite natural in extra dimensional model ; however , to obtain the hierarchy indicated by the data is more difficult .",
    "one way is to make use of family symmetry as in 4d models . another solution is purely extra dimensional which can also incorporate the masses of quarks and charged leptons .",
    "this is the split fermion scenario @xcite where the left - handed and right - handed fields are localized at different positions in the extra dimensional space .",
    "for example , the @xmath39 doublet is at @xmath40 and @xmath41 is at @xmath42 where @xmath43 denotes the extra dimension .",
    "this is repeated for other fermions .",
    "the gauge and higgs fields propagate in the bulk .",
    "the chiral fermions are also bulk fields and their zero modes , denoted by @xmath44 , are given gaussian profiles in @xmath43 .",
    "for a fermion located at @xmath45 its wave function is given by _",
    "i(x , z)~1 ^14 ^ 12 _ i(x ) e^- . where @xmath46 is a free parameter that is taken to be universal for all fermions for simplicity .",
    "the product of two fermion fields can be approximately replaced by _",
    "i(x , z)_j(x , z ) ~(- ) ( z-|z_ij)|_i(x)_j(x ) where @xmath47 is their average positions and @xmath48 . after integrating out @xmath43",
    "it is the overlap of the two different chiralities of a fermion that determines its mass .",
    "explicitly it is given by @xmath49 .",
    "the origin of the large mass for fermion is due to the proximity of its left and right - handed components in the extra dimension .",
    "similarly , if the chiral components of a fermion is far apart in @xmath43 it will be light .",
    "hence , one does not need to fine tune yukawa couplings but instead the positions @xmath45 are used to fit the data .",
    "it is found that realistic quark and lepton mass matrices and an acceptable ckm matrix can be be found @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the fermion masses becomes a geographical problem in the extra dimension .",
    "stating it differently we need a mechanism that puts the fermions in their correct positions instead of putting it in by hand . as a result , although it is non - trivial to be able to reproduce the observed masses and mixing , these models suffer from a lack of predictive power .",
    "as can be seen from esq.([eq : nummatrix ] ) that neutrinos will be massless in the sm and can have only a majoring mass via radiative effects .",
    "this is first done in @xcite within the sm gauger group by adding a @xmath50 singlet but @xmath51 charged scalar field .",
    "the model also requires an additional doublet hogs field @xmath52 . due to fermi statistics",
    "@xmath53 can only couple to leptons of two different families .",
    "the feynman diagram generating neutrino mass is given below    the resulting mass matrix is symmetric and takes the form _ = m_o ( 0&a&b + a&0&c + b&c&0 ) [ eq : zeemass ] where @xmath14 is an overall mass scale set by the mass of @xmath53 .",
    "in eq.([eq : zeemass ] ) @xmath54 are functions of lepton masses and higgs masses .",
    "the characteristics of the zee mass matrix are the vanishing diagonal elements .",
    "this structure leads to bi - maximal mixing @xcite and does not agree with the latest sno data @xcite . furthermore the model suffers from being arbitrary .",
    "however , the mass matrix is intriguing and can serve as the leading order to the correct mass matrix .",
    "to do so one has to find a natural way of filling in some of the zero s in the zee mass matrix .",
    "this can be achieved in 5d unification models which possess gauge symmetries in the bulk .",
    "the components of the the 5d fields that form representations of the symmetry can have different boundary values on the 4d brane .",
    "this reduces the symmetry that particles resides on the brane sees .",
    "this is known as orbifold symmetry breaking ( osb)mechanism .    to appreciate this a little more we consider a 5d theory with the extra dimension compactified in a circle ; i.e @xmath55 $ ] . if we impose a parity of @xmath56 such that a field @xmath57 transform as p : z - z pa(z)=a(z ) . clearly @xmath40 and @xmath58 are fixed points and the background geometry is @xmath59 .",
    "now we impose a second parity by defining @xmath60 such that p^ : z^-z^ the fixed points are at @xmath40 and @xmath61 and the geometry is @xmath62 .",
    "the fields can have different parities under @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "in particular the fourier decomposition of a bulk field into their kk modes that conform to the parities assignments are listed in table i.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table i. kk decomposition of a bulk field @xmath57 with parities @xmath65    the zero modes have @xmath66 parity and are identified as sm fields . as an example consider @xmath17 with the higgs field in the @xmath67 representation .",
    "we can assign @xmath68 parities to the @xmath69 components and different parities to the @xmath70 color higgs components .",
    "the former is just the sm higgs field and couples to sm matter fields which are placed on the @xmath40 brane whereas the colored higgs are kk excitations and will have masses @xmath71 .",
    "they latter will be heavy if the compactification radius @xmath38 is small and of the order of the unification scale .",
    "this provide a new natural solution to the doublet - triplet splitting problem in @xmath17 gut @xcite . for a review of orbifold gut models",
    "see @xcite . with this technique we can now shape new tools for investigating the fermion mass problem .    in ref.(@xcite",
    ") and ( @xcite ) this has been applied to study neutrino mass generation without the benefit of @xmath16 fields for @xmath70 and @xmath17 unification models .",
    "the first model is particularly simple and illustrates the clearly physics involved and extends previous work on this model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath72 symmetry is in the bulk and acts on a background geometry of @xmath73 .",
    "it only unifies the @xmath74 symmetry to @xmath75 and has obvious built in lepton number number violation when the leptons are placed in the fundamental @xmath76 i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "the unified value of the weak mixing angle is well known to be given by @xmath78 @xcite and one can expect unification to occur around @xmath79 after renormalization group considerations .",
    "the lepton triplet is placed on the @xmath40 brane and @xmath70 is broken by orbifolding the gauge fields and not by the higgs mechanism which is reserved for sm symmetry breaking .",
    "we require a bulk higgs field in the @xmath80 denoted by @xmath81 and a symmetric antisextet to give realistic charged lepton masses .",
    "we denote fields in by @xmath82 . due to the requirement of @xmath83 invariance",
    "we also introduce a second higgs triplet @xmath84 for the construction of the necessary coupling .    in this model the parities @xmath63 and @xmath64 are represented by @xmath85 matrices : p= (    ccc 1&0 & 0 + 0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & 1    ) , p^= (    ccc 1&0 & 0 + 0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & -1    ) .",
    "the parities of the components of higgs fields are engineered according to phenomenological needs and are _",

    "1 loop neutrino masses can be generated via    the dominant contribution comes from [ fig : loopsu3]a and leads to a zee - like neutrino mass matrix .",
    "the next two diagrams give the necessary correction to this .",
    "in contrast to 4d models these terms exist as part of the 5d model .",
    "we do not have to put them in by hand .",
    "two parameters central to all extra dimension models are the compactification radius @xmath38 and the cutoff scale @xmath86 at which the field theory becomes strong",
    ". a lower limit on @xmath87tev can be obtained from the non observation of kk modes and @xmath88 . without fine tuning of yukawas other than that required to get the charged lepton masses and using @xmath89 2 tev one can obtain @xmath90 which gives a good fit to the superk and sno data .",
    "this solution is of the imh type and interestingly predicts a detectable neutrinoless double beta decay rate in the next round of experiments .",
    "furthermore , the model has very rich phenomenology at the tev scale which is the compactification scale here .",
    "in particular double charged gauge boson are predicted for this model . which can be searched for in linear colliders .",
    "rare decays such as @xmath91 and similar @xmath92 decays are also sensitive probes of the model @xcite .    in the @xmath70 model it is known that quarks can not be accommodated and has to be placed at the other fixed point .",
    "it may be more natural to place quarks and leptons on the same footing as in the @xmath17 model .",
    "to generate neutrino masses with only the fifteen sm fermions per family requires the use of either @xmath93 or @xmath94 bulk higgs field .",
    "the procedure is similar to the case of @xmath70 exploiting osb .",
    "the addition of exotic higgs exacerbates the gauge unification problem in @xmath17 .",
    "this can be solved by additional fermions ( see @xcite ) . after the dust settles unification",
    "is found to take place at @xmath95 gev .",
    "an interesting result emerges for this model .",
    "it is more natural to get the nmh with the @xmath96 higgs and imh solutions can only be found with @xmath97 higgs fields .",
    "we have reviewed the construction of neutrino mass models in extra dimensions .",
    "the possibility of large extra dimension ; i.e @xmath98 has resulted in gaining very different perspectives in model building compared similar exercises in 4d .",
    "these models also have different low energy phenomenology than their 4d counterparts . in the dirac neutrino case one",
    "expects a sterile component in neutrino oscillation pattern . in the radiative mass mechanism",
    "we expect kk modes of gauge bosons that couples to bileptons .",
    "the 4d models on the other hand have only exotic scalar particles .",
    "these models has a serious down side .",
    "thus far all of them has many free parameters and is no better or worse than the 4d models .",
    "we also encounter very deep theoretical questions .",
    "what physics determines the compactification scale remains unanswered . for the orbifold models the origin of parities of the various fields is a mystery .    due to the lack of space we have not discuss neutrino mass in models that implement the seesaw mechanism in extra dimensions .",
    "this is studied for the @xmath18 case in @xcite . omitted",
    "are also discussions of neutrino masses in models with warp extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "we will only mention that this has been explored in the case of dirac neutrinos @xcite and @xcite . within the context of unification models",
    "the @xmath17 case was studied in @xcite .",
    "the many beautiful neutrino experiments have given us the first hint of physics beyond the sm .",
    "the bilarge neutrino mixing came as real surprise to theorists .",
    "they have stimulated us to explore scenarios which we have not ventured before .",
    "we can look forward for more data from the ongoing neutrino experiments and perhaps even more unexpected results .",
    "happily there will be more data to come both from high energy experiments with the anticipated turning on of lhc as well as many precision measurements at lower energies . before the new phyiscs becomes clear it behooves us to keep an open mind and be alert of new signatures .",
