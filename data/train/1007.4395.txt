    "the standard results of high - energy scattering processes based on the operator product expansion are consistent and work very well , but they are expected to be modified near the endpoint where the bjorken variable @xmath0 approaches 1 . since the available phase space is restricted near the endpoint region , peculiar physical results arise and there has been a lot of theoretical interest in the endpoint behavior of high - energy scattering processes .",
    "the kinematic peculiarity near the endpoint @xmath1 manifests two features which do not show up away from the endpoint region , where @xmath2 is a large scale and @xmath3 is the typical qcd scale for hadron masses .",
    "firstly , the soft wilson lines accompanied by collinear particles do not cancel completely , and the remnant is combined to produce soft functions . extracting",
    "the soft part is crucial in factorization proof . in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) near the endpoint , since the invariant mass of the final - state particles is @xmath4 , spectator particles after hard scattering can be either soft or collinear to the final - state jets leaving no particles in the beam direction . in drell - yan ( dy ) process near the endpoint @xmath5 , there can be only soft final - state particles except a lepton pair due to the kinematic constraint .",
    "comparing these two processes near the endpoint , the configurations of soft particles in the final states are different , causing different types of soft interactions , and the factorization proof near the endpoint is affected significantly by the soft parts .    secondly , the contribution of spectator partons to the scattering cross section , which is subleading away from the endpoint region , is not negligible near the endpoint and it should be included in the scattering cross section .",
    "it is not because the spectator contributions are enhanced , but because the leading contribution is suppressed near the endpoint to become of the same order as the spectator contribution .",
    "the proof that the spectator interaction becomes also important and the factorization property including the spectator interactions are the main theme of this paper .",
    "the momentum of an energetic hadron in the lightlike @xmath6-direction can be decomposed into @xmath7 where the lightcone vectors @xmath8 and @xmath9 satisfy @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the hadron is constrained to be on the mass shell @xmath12 , so are the partons constituting the hadron , such that a scattering process can be described in terms of the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) as the probability distribution . however , these constraints give rise to special kinematic situation near the endpoint .",
    "since the active parton undergoing hard scattering carries most of the energy inside the hadron , the @xmath6-component of the momentum for the spectator partons is of order @xmath3 .",
    "these spectator partons can have momenta satisfying the relative scaling to be @xmath6-collinear , but they can not be on the mass shell . if the spectator partons become soft with all the momentum components of order @xmath3 , they can be on the mass shell .",
    "but the total momentum of the hadron , being the sum of a collinear and a soft momenta , becomes of order @xmath13 , which is far off mass shell .",
    "therefore in order to be consistent with the constraints of the on - shellness at the partonic and at the hadronic levels , and the kinematic constraint in the endpoint region , the initial spectator quarks are energetic , @xmath6-collinear , and undergo a large momentum transfer inside the hadron of order @xmath14 or @xmath15 .    as a result , near the endpoint region",
    ", the spectator particles which are initially @xmath6-collinear become either @xmath16-collinear or soft after the large momentum transfer of order @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "this momentum transfer is related not to the hard scattering , but to the spectator interaction in the initial hadron .",
    "this necessitates the spectator interaction with a large momentum transfer in the scattering process near the endpoint in order to reflect the kinematic restrictions consistently .    as we will see later , it is the main reason for the suppression of the conventional scattering cross section near the endpoint , which becomes comparable to the contribution of the spectator interactions . in the standard region @xmath17 , the spectator contribution with a large momentum transfer",
    "is suppressed by @xmath18 compared to the leading conventional contribution , thus can be safely neglected .",
    "all - order factorization analyses ( in @xmath19 ) were presented in refs .",
    "@xcite near the endpoint region for drell - yan processes , and the subleading contributions suppressed by powers of @xmath20 from the final - state interactions via the subleading final - state jet functions were analyzed in refs .",
    "however , the issue of the spectator contribution has not been addressed in the limit @xmath21 in previous literature .",
    "careful power counting indicates that the leading contribution obtained away from the endpoint region experiences severe suppression such that it is comparable to the spectator contributions as @xmath0 goes to 1 .",
    "dis in the endpoint region has been so far conventionally described by the following schematic factorization formula  @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the conventional structure function in the endpoint , @xmath24 is a hard function , and @xmath25 is a pdf .",
    "@xmath26 represents the final - state jet function integrating out the degrees of freedom of order @xmath27 . and",
    "` @xmath28 ' denotes the convolution of the jet function with the pdf . in the framework of soft - collinear effective theory ( scet )  @xcite , this factorization formula has been revisited and confirmed without considering the spectator interactions  @xcite . if the spectator contribution should be included near the endpoint as discussed above , the conventional leading contribution of eq .",
    "( [ f1end ] ) is to be modified including this contribution , too .",
    "the pdf includes both the collinear part in the beam and the soft part .",
    "the collinear part can be described by the lightcone distribution amplitudes ( lcda ) for the initial hadron , and the soft part includes the final - state soft spectator quarks , which modifies the structure of the pdf .",
    "this mechanism also affects the longitudinal structure function @xmath29 .",
    "the dominant spectator contribution to @xmath29 comes from the subleading corrections to the current operator responsible for spectator interactions , and remarkably it becomes comparable to @xmath23 , since @xmath23 is suppressed near the endpoint .",
    "the callan - gross relation states that @xmath30 vanishes at leading order in @xmath31 , but it does not have to hold at subleading order we consider here . if we consider the subleading jet function related to the final - state particles alone without the spectator contribution , it is shown that the contribution to @xmath29 is suppressed by @xmath20  @xcite compared to @xmath23 .",
    "this arises from the subleading jet function by integrating out the degrees of freedom of order @xmath32 in the final state .",
    "however the new contributions which will be considered here turn out to be dominant , compared to the contribution to @xmath29 from subleading jet functions without the spectator interaction .    in drell - yan processes",
    ", the spectator particles can be in the original direction of the initial hadron as in dis away from the endpoint region .",
    "near the endpoint , since the invariant mass of the final - state hadrons is of order @xmath33 , there can be only soft particles .",
    "this is in contrast to dis , since the spectator particles are either @xmath34-collinear ( collinear to the final - state energetic collinear particle ) or soft in dis near the endpoint . in dis",
    ", the case with final @xmath34-collinear particles corresponds to the endpoint limit of the conventional approach , and can be compared to the new contribution with the spectator interaction .",
    "but there is no such analog of the case with @xmath34-collinear particles in dy processes .",
    "however , the situation gets more drastic since we should also consider the double parton annihilation in dy process , for it is less suppressed than the spectator interaction as far as the power counting is concerned .",
    "there is one hadronic scalar function to describe dy processes .",
    "the soft part differs from that in dis , hence needs some modification or a different definition in the pdf .",
    "away from the endpoint region , the soft part cancels , and the pdf consists of the matrix elements of collinear operators .",
    "it enables us to use universal pdfs independent of the scattering processes .",
    "that is , if we obtain or define the pdf in dis , it can be used in dy processes .",
    "near the endpoint , the soft part does not cancel , and it should be included in the definition of the pdf . if the pdf defined in dis is to be employed in dy processes , there should be some modification which incorporates the difference of the soft parts in the two processes .    in this paper , we consider the new contributions arising from spectator interactions in dis and dy processes .",
    "the power counting is performed systematically and it is shown that the size of the new contributions is comparable to the standard contribution near the endpoint and the factorization property is considered . in section  [ power ]",
    "we perform the power counting analysis in dis in the large @xmath0 limit and show how the spectators engage in the scattering process . in sec .",
    "[ facdis ] , we show the factorization property for the new contributions in dis .",

    "[ conc ] , we give a conclusion .",
    "a systematic power counting can be applied to study the suppression of the scattering cross section near the endpoint .",
    "let us illustrate how the power counting is performed in dis first .",
    "the momentum of the final states is given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the momentum transfer from the leptonic system and @xmath38 is the momentum of the initial hadron .",
    "the invariant mass of the final states is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the initial hadron mass .",
    "we now choose the breit frame in which @xmath42 and the initial hadron is described as an @xmath6-collinear particle .",
    "the invariant mass of the final state varies as @xmath0 changes .",
    "away from the endpoint , @xmath43 , and this represents general hard scattering processes . as @xmath21 , the invariant mass gets smaller , and",
    "the limit is classified into two regions .",
    "the first is the resonance region where @xmath44 with @xmath45 , in which only @xmath16-collinear hadrons are allowed kinematically in the final state .",
    "and the second is the endpoint region @xmath46 with @xmath47 , in which there can be @xmath16-collinear jets and soft hadrons .    in both regions",
    "there are no @xmath6-collinear final - state particles , while the initial - state partons are @xmath6-collinear particles .",
    "therefore the spectator particles have to interact with large momentum transfer to become either soft or @xmath34-collinear , and we have to include all the interactions of the initial partons . in the resonance region",
    "all the spectators undergo hard interactions with the momentum transfer of order @xmath14 , and then the spectator particles , which are initially @xmath6-collinear , are converted into @xmath16-collinear particles to make @xmath45 . in the endpoint region",
    "we have two possibilities : first , an @xmath6-collinear spectator inside the initial hadron can be @xmath16-collinear undergoing hard interactions as in the resonance region . but",
    "here the offshellness of the final state is allowed to be of order @xmath15 , much larger than the resonant case .",
    "secondly , a spectator loses most of its energy to the active parton and becomes a soft particle .",
    "this energy transfer between the active parton and the spectator is hard - collinear in the @xmath6 direction .",
    "its offshellness is of order @xmath15 , which is the typical offshellness of the final - state jet in the endpoint region .",
    "now we can perform the power counting of the hadronic tensor for inclusive dis , which is defined as @xmath48 where @xmath24 is the initial hadron , @xmath49 is an electromagnetic current , and the summation includes the phase space of the final - state particles .",
    "the power counting on the volume @xmath50 depends on how much phase space is available . for power",
    "counting on the remaining part @xmath51 , we divide it into three parts ; the initial state , the amplitude squared , and the final state contributions . here",
    "we focus on the amplitudes at tree level , but the result on the power counting by @xmath52 can be easily extended to loop corrections because no loop contribution can enhance the amplitude by inverse powers of @xmath53 .    in the standard region",
    "where @xmath54 , @xmath50 covers the full phase space , hence power - counted as @xmath55 .",
    "the initial - state part is schematically written as @xmath56 . here @xmath57 is an @xmath6-collinear quark and scales as @xmath58 with @xmath52 , and the collinear state @xmath59 scales as @xmath60 .",
    "therefore the initial - state part yields the factor @xmath2 .",
    "the final state contains @xmath61 , where @xmath62 comes from the spinor sum of the final state . because the final state carries the hard momentum in the standard region , the power counting states that @xmath63 .",
    "also the amplitude squared is simply @xmath64 . in the standard region ,",
    "spectator contributions do no change the power counting since they are of order 1 or give higher powers of @xmath53 .",
    "therefore the overall power counting for the structure function yields @xmath64 .",
    "as explained above , the spectator contribution should be included near the endpoint region .",
    "it is also important how many particles there are in the leading fock space of the initial hadron @xmath24 . in the case of a pion , there are @xmath65 in the leading fock space and @xmath66 for a proton . and",
    "the power counting on the structure functions for a pion and a proton is different .",
    "because all the partons are involved in the scattering process , the time - ordered products of the electromagnetic current and the interaction lagrangians including all the spectators should be taken into account in the hadronic tensor @xmath67 .",
    "for the power counting of the initial - state contributions , we consider @xmath68 for an initial - state pion and @xmath69 for a proton neglecting irrelevant lorentz structure and color factors . from our power counting rule , these yield the factors @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively , and the structure function for the proton is more suppressed than the structure function for the pion near the endpoint .",

    "[ dyhard ] can be dressed with soft gluons for final - state soft particles , but careful analysis of power counting shows that emission of soft gluons does not alter the result of the power counting without soft gluons .",
    "one thing to note in fig .",
    "[ dyhard ] ( a ) is that the feynman diagram , when rotated , is exactly the same as the one for the pion form factor .",
    "it is interesting that the pion form factor and the double parton annihilation in dy processes are related .",
    "the complication in dy processes near the endpoint lies in the fact that there exists no limiting process from the conventional approach , and the double parton annihilation is less suppressed both in powers of @xmath19 and @xmath304 . among the contributions from hard - collinear gluon exchange , there can be nonfactorizable contributions when we take the lcda for the initial state .",
    "if these nonfactorizable contributions are dominant , we can arguably regard @xmath305 or @xmath306 from hard - collinear exchange without additional suppression by multiple powers of @xmath307 , as we considered on the estimate of the sizes of @xmath23 and @xmath29 in dis . in that case , these contributions from hard - collinear gluon exchange can be numerically comparable to the hard gluon contributions resulting in double parton annihilation , treating @xmath308 .",
    "on the other hand , if the double parton annihilation is the major contribution near the endpoint region , its effect may be noticeable as we get away from the endpoint region .",
    "but note that the conventional leading contribution of order 1 becomes dominant away from the endpoint region , and all the contributions considered above become subleading and are negligible . in some region between the standard region and the endpoint region , the effect of the double parton annihilation may be noticeable .",
    "however , for precise estimate and comparison , a more detailed analysis is necessary .",
    "the conventional approaches neglecting the spectator contribution have proposed the following factorization formula  @xcite @xmath309 where @xmath310 is the hard function of order 1 , @xmath311 is the soft function consisting of the products of the soft wilson lines , and @xmath312 is the convolution of the parton distributions , which is given by @xmath313 since @xmath314 in eq .",
    "( [ cfdy ] ) is of order 1 .",

    "therefore the estimate of the size in the conventional approach seems to favor the power counting of the hard - collinear contribution in eq .",
    "( [ hcgdy ] ) .",
    "however it is not clear whether we can justify the parameterization of the contributions from hard or hard - collinear gluon exchanges as the convolution of the pdfs .",
    "high - energy scattering processes near the endpoint region are hard to analyze in experiment , but they offer an intriguing opportunity to disentangle the structure of factorization properties in qcd . in this paper , a power counting analysis is performed for the structure functions in dis and in dy processes near the endpoint region to claim that there are new contributions from hard - collinear gluon exchanges to be included since they are comparable to the currently available leading contributions .",
    "an important feature in this analysis is to apply kinematic constraints of the endpoint region to classify the possible types of final - state particles , while the initial partons and hadrons are required to be on the mass shell @xmath12 .",
    "the resonance region is defined as the final states with @xmath12 , and the endpoint region is defined as those with @xmath32 . according to this classification , dis can have both the resonance region and the endpoint region , but dy processes have actually only the resonance region .",
    "the explicit factorization proof for hard - collinear gluon exchanges in dis is interesting in itself , but it is also illuminating to compare this process with nonleptonic @xmath180 decays into two light mesons . in the factorization proof for nonleptonic",
    "@xmath180 decays @xcite , we have considered the contribution of the four - quark operators along with the spectator interactions since they are of the same order . in the spectator interaction , a hard - collinear gluon is exchanged between the four - quark operator and a spectator quark in a @xmath180 meson , and the final - state particles become collinear to form mesons .",
    "the hard - collinear gluon exchange considered here in dis is exactly the reverse process of this spectator interaction , in which the final - state collinear particles are the incoming partons , and the initial soft quark is the final soft particle , and the heavy @xmath317 quark is replaced by the @xmath34-collinear final - state jet .",
    "the factorization property of various spectator interactions is similar in both cases , noting the difference between a heavy quark and an @xmath34-collinear particle .",
    "this , along with the comparison between the double parton annihilation in dy processes and the pion form factor , shows an interesting relationship among different processes .    in dis , the spectator interaction has the same power counting as the process with final @xmath34-collinear particles , hence it",
    "should be included to be consistent .",
    "however , in dy processes , the spectator interaction exists , but it is suppressed compared to the double parton annihilation .",
    "this result is surprising , but here we have considered only the power counting of various contributions , and we have not tried to give numerical analysis of those since it belongs to a future work . the power counting analysis indicates the degree of suppression in powers of @xmath318 or @xmath304 , but the actual contributions also involve other parameters such as some powers of @xmath19 at different scales @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
