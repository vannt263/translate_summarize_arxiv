    "over the last few decades , general relativity in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions has fascinated both field theorists and relativists because of its fertility as a test - bed for ideas about quantum gravity .",
    "one particular feature of interest is manifest when a negative cosmological constant is present .",
    "despite the fact that the spacetime geometry of this solution is an anti - de sitter ( ads ) spacetime , possessing negative constant curvature , a black hole can be present under a suitable choice of topological identifications @xcite .",
    "this solution has drawn much attention since its inception from a wide variety of perspectives @xcite .",
    "shortly after the black hole solution was obtained , it was shown that it can be formed from a disk of pressureless dust undergoing gravitational collapse @xcite ( the three - dimensional analogue of oppenheimer - snyder type collapse ) , generalizing earlier results that suggested matter could collapse to form conical singularities @xcite .",
    "further study on this subject has been carried out from several viewpoints , including the formation of a black hole from colliding point particles @xcite and the more recent demonstration of critical phenomena in the context of collapse @xcite .",
    "these results are consistent with other results in four dimensions as well as results in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "recently , a cosmological model of a ( generalized ) chaplygin gas ( gcg ) was introduced as a possibile explanation of the present acceleration of the universe , the existence of dark energy , and the unification of dark energy and dark matter @xcite .",
    "historically its original motivation was to account for the lifting force on a plane wing in aerodynamics @xcite .",
    "afterwards , the same equation of state was rediscovered in the context of aerodynamics @xcite .",
    "a more interesting feature of this gas was recently renewed in an intriguing connection with string theory , insofar as its equation of state can be obtained from the nambu - goto action for @xmath0-branes moving in a @xmath1-dimensional spacetime in the light - cone frame @xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been shown that the chaplygin gas is , to date , the only fluid that admits a supersymmetric generalization @xcite ; the relevant symmetry group was described in ref .",
    "moreover , further theoretical developments of the gcg were given in terms of cosmology and astrophysics @xcite .",
    "inspired by the fact that the chaplygin gas has a negative pressure , violating the energy conditions ( in particular the null energy condition ( nec ) ) , traversable wormhole solutions were found in four dimensions lobo .",
    "it is natural to ask whether or not a black hole can be formed from gravitational collapse of this gas in a finite collapse time .",
    "much of the work on black hole formation deals with pressureless dust collapse ; collapse of this kind of exotic fluid to black holes so far has not received much treatment .",
    "recent work @xcite involved investigation of spherically symmetric clouds of a collapsing modified chaplygin gas in four dimensions , where it was shown that it always leads to the formation of a black hole .    in this paper , we investigate some gravitational collapse scenarios of shells with a variety of equations of state , including the gcg shell . to set the stage",
    "we first consider the collapse of a shell of pressureless dust . in dust collapse",
    "scenarios the evolution of the system is obtained by matching the inside and outside geometries using the junction conditions @xcite , @xmath2=0,~~[k_{ij}]=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath3 \\equiv h_{+ } - h_{-}$ ] and ( @xmath4 ) and ( @xmath5 ) represent exterior and interior spacetimes , respectively .",
    "however for shells with pressure the junction condition for the extrinsic curvature in eq .",
    "( [ eq : junctions ] ) is no longer valid , since there is a nonvanishing surface stress - energy on the boundary of the shell to take into account .",
    "the main result of our investigation is that gravitational collapse in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions does not necessarily lead to black hole formation for any of the fluid sources we study .",
    "the end points of collapse depend on the initial conditions , and can lead to either a black hole or the formation of a singularity and a cauchy horizon .",
    "this singularity is characterized by the onset of a divergent stress energy in the shell , whose intrinsic ricci scalar also diverges in finite proper time for observers comoving with the shell . for pressureless dust",
    "the singularity develops when the shell collapses to zero size .",
    "however for shells with pressure the singularity develops at some nonzero size characterized by the equation of state .",
    "a similar scenario holds for the gcg shell .",
    "we also find that collapse is not the only possibility , but that shells can also expand out to infinity , possibly with a bounce depending on the initial conditions .",
    "our results are consistent with earlier work on shell collapse in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions @xcite , generalizing them to include a more detailed analysis of collapse to naked singularities , and to situations in which a more general relationship between density and pressure is assumed .",
    "the outline of our paper is as follows . in section [ sec : shell ] ,",
    "we briefly present a formulation of the shell collapse and obtain the evolution equation for the dust shell radius . in section [ sec :",
    "dustshell ] , the gravitational collapses of pressureless dust shell are studied and compared to the result of dust cloud collapse in @xcite . in section [ sec :",

    "for example if @xmath69 then @xmath70 in order to preserve the metric signature .",
    "there are additional restrictions that arise from the reality of the collapse trajectory , which imply that the quantities @xmath71 must either be pure real or pure imaginary .",
    "this yields @xmath72 , or @xmath73    much of the general behaviour of the solution can be understood by noting that eq .",
    "( [ eq : eqdusteffp ] ) describes the one - dimensional motion of a point particle of zero energy in the effective potential @xmath74 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : effp ] ) , which is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : effectptdust ] .",
    "note that only the @xmath75 part of the potential is relevant ; the behaviour of the shell will depend on the number of roots of the effective potential in this region .",

    "if there is one degenerate root , then the shell can either ( a ) sit in an unstable equilibrium at some fixed value @xmath76 ( provided @xmath77 ) , ( b ) collapse to either a black hole or a naked singularity provided its initial size is such that @xmath78 , or ( c ) exhibit the behaviour of the non - degenerate single root case , provided @xmath79 . if there are two roots , then there will either be collapse to a black hole or naked singularity , or else the behaviour will be qualitatively similar to that of the non - degenerate single root case .",
    "these various cases are illustrated in figure [ fig : effectptdust ] by the arrows that indicate possible trajectories of the shell and resemble in part the higher - dimensional situation @xcite.the key distinction here is the possible of collapse of the shell either to zero size or to a black hole , depending on the choice of parameters and the initial conditions .",

    "one gets a hint of the underlying problem upon realizing that @xmath85 will not be zero at the end point of collapse .",
    "this suggests a bounce , but since the interior spacetime has shrunk to zero size , the future evolution of the spacetime after such a putative bounce is not uniquely determined .",
    "instead , as the shell collapses its induced curvature becomes singular as @xmath86 , as is clear from the expansion of the ricci scalar associated with the induced metric ( [ eq:2 ] ) @xmath87 = \\frac{1}{x^2(t)}\\left(x(t ) \\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2 } -   \\left(\\frac{dx}{dt}\\right)^2\\right)= -\\frac{1}{2(t - t_0)^2 } + \\cdots\\ ] ] which diverges quadratically regardless of the values of the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    if @xmath88 this singularity will be cloaked by an event horizon .",
    "however if @xmath89 the ostensible point mass end state suggested by the form of the exterior metric will actually be an incomplete spacetime , with a cauchy horizon emerging from the singularity .",
    "there is nothing _ a - priori _ to prevent this choice for @xmath90 , and so there will be a range of initial conditions ( even for asymptotically flat space ) in which the end state of collapse yields a naked singularity , in violation of cosmic censorship .",

    "the role of pressure is that of shifting the singular point at @xmath124 to some finite radial position , sustaining the shell with a finite size .    despite the qualitatively different physics of the gcg shell , we find that it can exhibit similar behaviour to the other two cases",

    "<S> we study gravitationally collapsing models of pressureless dust , fluids with pressure , and the generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) shell in ( 2 + 1)-dimensional spacetimes . </S>",
    "<S> various collapse scenarios are investigated under a variety of the background configurations such as anti - de sitter(ads ) black hole , de sitter ( ds ) space , flat and ads space with a conical deficit . as with the case of a disk of dust , we find that the collapse of a dust shell coincides with the oppenheimer - snyder type collapse to a black hole provided the initial density is sufficiently large </S>",
    "<S> . we also find  for all types of shell  that collapse to a naked singularity is possible under a broad variety of initial conditions . for shells with pressure </S>",
    "<S> this singularity can occur for a finite radius of the shell . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that gcg shells exhibit diverse collapse scenarios , which can be easily demonstrated by an effective potential analysis .    gr - qc/0609094    </S>",
