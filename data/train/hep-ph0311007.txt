    "neutrinos are the only particles in nature , which are characterized by weak interactions only .",
    "they are thus expected to provide the laboratory for understanding the fundamental laws of nature .",
    "furthermore they are electrically neutral particles characterized by a very small mass .",
    "thus it is an open question whether they are truly neutral , in which case the particle coincides with its own antiparticle , i.e. they are majorana particles , or they are characterized by some charge , in which case they are of the dirac type , i.e the particle is different from its antiparticle @xcite . it is also expected that the neutrinos produced in weak interactions are not eigenstates of the world hamiltonian , they are not stationary states , in which case one expects them to exhibit oscillations @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    "such neutrino oscillations seem to have observed in atmospheric neutrino @xcite , interpreted as @xmath7 oscillations , as well as @xmath3 disappearance in solar neutrinos @xcite .",
    "these results have been recently confirmed by the kamland experiment @xcite , which exhibits evidence for reactor antineutrino disappearance .",
    "this has been followed by an avalanche of interesting analyses @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to discuss a new experiment to study the above neutrino properties as they may appear in the low energy neutrinos emitted in triton decay : @xmath0 with maximum neutrino energy of @xmath1 .",
    "this process has previously been suggested @xcite as a means of studying heavy neutrinos like the now extinct @xmath8 neutrino .",
    "the detection will be accomplished employing gaseous micromegas , large tpc ( time projection counters ) detectors with good energy resolution and low background @xcite .",
    "in addition in this new experiment we hope to observe or set much more stringent constraints on the neutrino magnetic moments .",
    "this very interesting question has been around for a number of years and it has been revived recently @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the existence of the neutrino magnetic moment can be demonstrated either in neutrino oscillations in the presence of strong magnetic fields or in electron neutrino scattering .",
    "the latter is expected to dominate over the weak interaction in the triton experiment since the energy of the outgoing electron is very small .",
    "furthermore the possibility of directional experiments will provide additional interesting signatures .",
    "even experiments involving polarized electron targets are beginning to be contemplated @xcite .",
    "there are a number of exciting studies , of fundamental physics issues , that could be made using a large volume tpc and low energy antineutrinos :    * the oscillation length is comparable to the length of the detector .",
    "measuring the counting rate of neutrino elastic scattering as function of the distance of the source will give a precise and unambiguous measurement of the oscillation parameters free of systematic errors .",
    "first estimations show that a sensitivity of a few percent for the measurement of @xmath9 . *",
    "the low energy detection threshold offers a unique sensitivity for the neutrino magnetic moment , which is about two orders of magnitude beyond the current experimental limit of @xmath4 . in our estimates below",
    "we will use the optimistic value of @xmath10 . *",
    "scattering at such low neutrino energies has never been studied before .",
    "in addition one may exploit the extra signature provided by the photon in radiative electron neutrino scattering . as a result any departure from the expected behavior may be an indication of physics beyond the standard model .    in the following we will present a summary of various theoretical studies and possible novel measurements",
    "at this point it instructive to elaborate a little bit on the neutrino mass combinations entering various experiments .    * * cosmological constraints*. we get @xcite : @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 ( majorana neutrinos ) . + the limit becomes @xmath14 without the ly-@xmath15 forest data for dirac neutrinos the value of the upper limit is half the above .",

    "this can only be done via lepton violating processes , like : * @xmath20 decay . +",
    "this provides an additional independent linear combinations of the masses and the majorana phases .",
    "@xmath21    thus the two independent relative cp phases can in principle be measurable . * so these three types of experiments together can specify all parameters not settled by the neutrino oscillation experiments*.    anyway from the neutrino oscillation data alone we can not infer the mass scale . thus the following scenarios emerge    1 .",
    "the lightest neutrino is @xmath17 and its mass is very small .",
    "this is the normal hierarchy scenario .",
    "then : @xmath22 2 .   the inverted hierarchy scenario . in this case",
    "the mass @xmath23 is very small .",
    "then : @xmath24 3 .   the degenerate scenario . in such a situation",
    "all masses are about equal and much larger than the differences appearing in neutrino oscillations . in this case",
    "we can obtain limits on the mass scale as follows : * from triton decay .",
    "then @xcite @xmath25 this limit is expected to substantially improve in the future @xcite . * from @xmath26 decay .",
    "the analysis now depends on the mixing matrix and the cp phases of the majorana neutrino eigenstates @xcite ( see discussion below ) .",
    "the best limit coming from @xmath26 decay is : @xmath27 for relative cp phase of the two strongly admixed states is @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "+ these limits are going to greatly improve in the next generation of experiments , see e.g. the review by vergados @xcite and the experimental references therein .",
    "the elastic neutrino electron scattering , which has played an important role in physics @xcite , is very crucial in our investigation , since it will be employed for the detection of neutrinos .",
    "so we will briefly discuss it before we embark on the discussion of the apparatus .",
    "following the pioneering work of t hooft @xcite as well as the subsequent work of vogel and engel @xcite one can write the relevant differential cross section as follows : @xmath30 we ignored the contribution due to the neutrino charged radius .",
    "we will not consider separately the scattering of electrons bound in the atoms , since such effects have recently been found to be small @xcite .",
    "the cross section due to weak interaction alone takes the form @xcite : @xmath31   \\label{elasw }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 @xmath33 for antineutrinos @xmath34 . to set the scale we see that = 0.44510 ^ -48   [ weekval ] in the above expressions for the @xmath35 only the neutral current has been included , while for @xmath3 both the neutral and the charged current contribute .",
    "the second piece of the cross - section becomes : @xmath36 where in the mass basis @xmath37 takes the form @xmath38 @xmath39 for dirac and majorana neutrinos respectively .",
    "for the definition of @xmath40 and @xmath41 see sec .",
    "[ secno ] below . in the case of dirac",
    "neutrinos the off diagonal elements of the magnetic moment were meglected .",
    "the angle @xmath42 is the relative cp phase of of the dominant neutrino majorana mass eigenstates present in the electronic neutrino .",
    "the contribution of the magnetic moment can also be written as : @xmath43 the quantity @xmath44 sets the scale for the cross section and is quite small , @xmath45 .",
    "the electron energy depends on the neutrino energy and the scattering angle and is given by : @xmath46 for @xmath47 one finds that the maximum electron kinetic energy approximately is @xcite : @xmath48 integrating the differential cross section between @xmath49 and @xmath50 we find that the total cross section is : @xmath51 it is tempting for comparison to express the above em differential cross section in terms of the weak interaction , near the threshold of @xmath52 , as follows : @xmath53 the parameter @xmath54 essentially gives the ratio of the interaction due to the magnetic moment divided by that of the weak interaction .",
    "evaluated at the energy of @xmath55 it becomes : @xmath56 its value , of course , will be larger if the magnetic moment is larger than @xmath57 .",
    "anyway the magnetic moment at these low energies can make a detectable contribution provided that it is not much smaller than @xmath57 . in many cases one would like to know the difference between the cross section of the electronic neutrino and that of one of the other flavors , i.e. ( e_,t)= [ elas4 ] with @xmath58 is either @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) . then from the above expression for the differential cross - section one finds : = 2 [ [ elas5 ] with @xmath61 for antineutrinos the above equation is slightly modified to yield = 2 [ [ elas6 ] specializing eq .",
    "[ elasw ] in the case of the antineutrino - electron scattering we get : @xmath62   \\label{elaswb }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this last equation can be used to measure @xmath63 at very low momentum transfers , almost 30 years after the first historic measurement by reiness , gur and sobel @xcite . in the present experiment",
    "we will measure the differential cross section as a function of @xmath64 , which is a essentially a straight line . with sufficient statistics we expect to construct the straight line sufficiently accurately , so that we can extract @xmath63 both from the slope and the intercept achieving high precision .",
    "we should mention that the present method does not suffer from the well known supression of the weak charge associated with other low energy processes @xcite including the atomic physics experiments @xcite .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dependence on the weinberg angle in these experiments comes from the neutral current vector coupling of the electron and/or the proton , involving the combination @xmath65 .",
    "thus in our approach it may not be necessary to go through an elaborate scheme of radiative corrections ( see the recent work by erler _",
    "et al _ @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "in this section we will focus on the experimental considerations    one of the attractive features of the gaseous tpc is its ability to precisely reconstruct particle trajectories without precedent in the redundancy of experimental points , i.e. a bubble chamber quality with higher accuracy and real time recording of the events .",
    "many proposals are actually under investigation to exploit the tpc advantages for various astroparticle projects and especially solar or reactor neutrino detection and dark matter search @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a common goal is to fully reconstruct the direction of the recoil particle trajectory , which together with energy determination provide a valuable piece of information .",
    "the virtue of using the tpc concept in such investigations has been now widely recognized and a special international workshop has been recently organized in paris @xcite .",
    "the study of low energy elastic neutrino - electron scattering using a strong tritium source was envisaged in by bouchez and giomataris @xcite employing a large volume gaseous cylindrical tpc .",
    "we will present here an alternate detector concept with different experimental strategy based on a spherical tpc design .",
    "a sketch of the principal features of the proposed tpc is shown in fig .",

    "our approach is radically different from all other neutrino oscillation experiments in that it measures the neutrino interactions , as a function of the distance source - interaction point , with an oscillation length that is fully contained in the detector ; it is equivalent to many experiments made in the conventional way where the neutrino flux is measured in a single space point .",
    "furthermore , since the oscillation length is comparable to the detector depth , we expect an exceptional signature : a counting rate oscillating from the triton source location to the depth of the gas volume , i.e. at first a decrease , then a minimum and finally an increase .",
    "in other words we will have a full observation of the oscillation process as it has already been done in accelerator experiments with neutral strange particles ( @xmath66 ) .    to summarize :",
    "* the aim of the proposed detector will be the detection of very low energy neutrinos emitted by a strong tritium source through their elastic scattering on electrons of the target . *",
    "the @xmath67 elastic differential cross section is the sum of the charged and neutral current contributions ( see sec .",
    "[ secens ] ) and is a function of the energy .",
    "it is , however , it is quite small , see eq .",
    "( [ weekval ] ) . *",
    "integrating this cross section up to energies of @xmath68 we get a very small value , @xmath69 .",
    "this means that , to get a significant signal in the detector , for 200 mcurie tritium source ( see next section ) we will need about 20 kilotons of gaseous material .",
    "* the elastic @xmath67 cross section , being dominated by the charged current , especially for low energy electrons ( see fig . [ chi ] below ) , will be different from that of the other flavors , which is due to the neutral current alone .",
    "this will allow us to observe neutrino oscillation enabling a modulation on the counting rate along the oscillation length .",
    "the effect depends on the electron energy t as is shown in sec .",
    "[ secno ]    we assume a spherical type detector , described in the previous section , filed with xenon gas at ntp and a tritium source of 20 kg , providing a very - high intensity neutrino emission of @xmath70 .",
    "the monte carlo program is simulating all the relevant processes :    * beta decay and neutrino energy random generation * oscillation process of @xmath3 due to the small mixing @xmath71 ( see eq .",
    "[ osceq ] below ) . * neutrino elastic scattering with electrons of the gas target * energy deposition , ionization processes and transport of charges to the micromegas detector .",

    "[ ioa3 ] the energy distribution of the detected neutrinos , assuming a detection threshold of 200 ev , is exhibited .",
    "the energy is concentrated around 13 kev with a small tail to lower values .    .",

    "we observe a decreasing of the signal up to about 6.5 m and then a rise .",
    "backgrounds are not yet included in this simulation but the result looks quite promising ; even in the case of the lowest mixing angle the oscillation is seen , despite statistical fluctuations .",
    "we should point out that in the context of this experiment complete elimination of the backgrounds is not necessary .",
    "it is worth noting that :    * a source - off measurement at the beginning of the experiment will yield the background level to be subtracted from the signal . * fitting the observed oscillation pattern will provide , for the first time , a stand alone measurement of the oscillation parameters , the mixing angle and the square mass square difference .",
    "* systematic effects due to backgrounds or to bad estimates of the neutrino flux , which is the main worry in most of the neutrino experiments , are highly reduced in this experiment .",
    "the available neutrino oscillation data ( solar @xcite and atmospheric @xcite)as well as the kamland @xcite results can adequately be described by the following matrix :    @xmath74 + up to order @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "sometimes we will use @xmath71 instead of @xmath77 .",
    "knowledge of this angle is very crucial for cp violation in the leptonic sector , since it may complex even if the neutrinos are dirac particles . in the above expressions we have not absorbed the phases arising , if the neutrinos happen to be majorana particles,@xmath78 where c denotes the charge conjugation , @xmath79 , which guarantee that the eigenmasses are positive .",

    "<S> the purpose of the present paper is to study the neutrino properties as they may appear in the low energy neutrinos emitted in triton decay : @xmath0 with maximum neutrino energy of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the technical challenges to this end can be summarized as building a very large tpc capable of detecting low energy recoils , down to a few 100 ev , within the required low background constraints . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically we propose the development of a spherical gaseous tpc of about 10-m in radius and a 200 mcurie triton source in the center of curvature . </S>",
    "<S> one can list a number of exciting studies , concerning fundamental physics issues , that could be made using a large volume tpc and low energy antineutrinos : 1 ) the oscillation length involving the small angle @xmath2 , directly measured in our @xmath3 disappearance experiment , is fully contained inside the detector . </S>",
    "<S> measuring the counting rate of neutrino - electron elastic scattering as function of the distance of the source will give a precise and unambiguous measurement of the oscillation parameters free of systematic errors . </S>",
    "<S> in fact first estimations show that even with a year s data taking a sensitivity of a few percent for the measurement of the above angle will be achieved . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) the low energy detection threshold offers a unique sensitivity for the neutrino magnetic moment which is about two orders of magnitude beyond the current experimental limit of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) scattering at such low neutrino energies has never been studied and any departure from the expected behavior may be an indication of new physics beyond the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> we present a summary of various theoretical studies and possible measurements , including a precise measurement of the weinberg angle at very low momentum transfer .    </S>",
