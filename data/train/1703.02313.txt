    "whatever platform is used if you want to transmit a signal for long distances you have to overcome two main challenges : dissipation and dispersion .",
    "dissipation is an intrinsic characteristic of the material used , dispersion instead is something that can be manipulated by the geometry of the media and by the structure of the signal you are transmitting .",
    "here we investigate how a non - trivial dispersion can affect the structure of the signal and its diffusion .    in this work ,",
    "we excite moving wavepackets made of polaritons , hybrid two - dimensional bosonic fluid of light and matter inside a semiconductor microcavity .",
    "the mixing of photons with the electronic dipoles confers to the signal a non - parabolic dispersion .",
    "such dispersion under opportune conditions triggers the self - reshaping of the signal towards a propagation - invariant solution of the wave equation .",
    "thanks to the coherence properties of the polaritons we can also obtain an ultrafast imaging of their fluid dynamics . we gain a fundamental understanding of the interplay of nonlinear processes and the dispersion properties , tuning them in order for the packet to assume a peculiar x - shape which is then preserved upon propagation .",
    "bosonic polariton x - waves can help shed light on fundamental linear and nonlinear wave dynamics and could be exploited for low intensity signal transmission in polariton based optoelectronic schemes , robust against loss - of - power distortion issues .",
    "x - waves ( xws)@xcite are a specific type of nonspreading wavepackets , which maintain their transverse shape along a large field - depth with respect , e.g. , to gaussian beams or packets",
    ". another well known class of nonspreading waves , are solitons . however , in case of solitons , dispersion is constantly compensated by nonlinearity in the medium .",
    "xws , instead , as other types of nonspreading waves , generally formed by bessel beams , can maintain their shape also in absence of nonlinearity @xcite and are relevant in any system which is governed by the wave equation .",
    "the first experimental demonstration of such optical waves employed a cw laser light @xcite .",
    "these beams are not free from diffraction , but their transverse profile is such that keeps its main peak well confined , while the weaker lateral ones expand upon propagation . the same _ localization _ principle holds for pulsed xw packets that , in essence , are a polychromatic superposition of bessel beams @xcite .    since the early 90s xws have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally using nonspreading acoustic pulses by lu and greenleaf @xcite .",
    "later xws were obtained with light by injecting sub - ps laser pulses across a dispersive material @xcite , demonstrating the potential for signal transmission and imaging .",
    "indeed their applications span from high resolution ultrasound scanning to optical imaging , from free space communications to optical tweezers , such as accelerating or guiding beams @xcite . among their fascinating properties ,",
    "it s worth mentioning that x - waves in vacuum also correspond to the simplest superluminal waveforms @xcite , i.e. , solutions with effective velocity higher than @xmath0 , which emerges from the superposition of ordinary bessel beams @xcite and at the same time conform with the constraints of special relativity and the causality principle @xcite .",
    "the renewed interest in the xws is also driven by their potential applicability in the field of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) @xcite and dissipative polariton condensates @xcite .",
    "both these systems bear deep similarity to the electromagnetic case because all these systems can be described by nonlinear schrdinger equations @xcite .",
    "several theoretical proposals have been developed on the topic such as the possibility to obtain localized wave packet of matter in cold gases without needs of confining potentials @xcite .",
    "recently , a quantum description of xws has been also developed , highlighting the difference in the entanglement properties between externally imprinted and spontaneously generated states @xcite .",
    "however x - waves have not been imprinted or generated in a bec yet .    here",
    "we report for the first time on the experimental self - generation of an xw in a two - dimensional exciton - polariton superfluid as predicted in a recent theoretical proposal @xcite following their evolution with ultrafast imaging . upon fine tuning of the peculiar polariton properties we achieve a regime for self - generating an xw starting from an exciting gaussian photonic pulse , and observe its propagation along a distance tens of @xmath1 wide .",
    "microcavity exciton polaritons  @xcite are bosonic particles which result from the mixing of two quasi - parabolic modes , the qw ( quantum well ) excitons and the mc ( microcavity ) photons , with dispersions of highly unbalanced curvatures .",
    "the anticrossing feature of the bare modes , associated to the strong coupling regime , finally produces the highly non - parabolic shape of one of the new normal modes , namely the lower polariton branch ( lpb ) @xcite .",
    "in particular the presence of an inflection point , representing both a maximum of the group velocity ( @xmath2 ) and an inversion of the so called _ diffusive _ effective mass [ @xmath3 @xcite , is the fundamental reason for the xw spontaneous formation .",
    "polaritons also exhibit very strong nonlinearities @xcite able to achieve superfluid regimes @xcite supporting quantized vortex @xcite , or leading to several pattern @xcite and soliton states formation @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the xw , a solution which exists in the linear limit , is fundamentally different from the two - dimensional bright solitons discussed in @xcite , where localization was achieved in the so called bistability regime , in which the soliton wavepacket was supported by an additional pump laser .",
    "these dissipative solitons exist only in a very narrow range of pumping powers and fall in the strongly nonlinear regime @xcite . differently from the case of bright solitons , that are self - sustained by nonlinear effects ,",
    "polariton xw only rely on the peculiar non - parabolic dispersion , and could be exploited for the long distance propagation of signals and in new integrated optoelectronic circuits schemes .",
    "we use a high q microcavity , the details of which can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , at zero detuning between the excitonic ( @xmath4 ) and photonic ( @xmath5 ) fields , leading to two hybrid modes , the lpb and the upper polariton branch ( upb ) , well separated with respect to their linewidths .",
    "the two modes can hence manifest their dispersions , observed upon collecting the non - resonantly excited fluorescence as shown in fig .",
    "[ disp](a ) . here , we will focus our attention only to the lpb which shows a strong non - parabolic behavior at higher @xmath6 vectors .",
