    "the rotational properties of spiral galaxies are the original experimental evidence@xcite that dark matter must exist .",
    "subsequently , modern cosmology in the form of cold dark matter requires dark matter to be a large contributor to the energy density of the universe .",

    "this is a higher power of @xmath13 than the familiar linard formula for charged particles q @xmath14 \\ ; .\\ ] ] only in turbulent , chaotic plasmas is this dipole radiation loss realizable .",
    "however , in the early universe , large , chaotic , and turbulent fields are expected@xcite .",
    "if the neutrinos lose energy in this manner , they are anticipated to condense and form degenerate neutrino matter .",
    "if this happens , the cno are the largest and most massive objects in the universe@xcite and become the ` dark matter ' , which everybody is looking for . in this paper ,",
    "we take the three spiral galaxies of the local group and use their rotational data to elucidate the properties of the cno which appears to embed them .",
    "m33 , m31 and the milky way are the only spiral galaxies of the local group .",
    "the rotational data of m33@xcite and m31@xcite possess a unique property : they have no noticable azimuth angle dependence .",
    "the physics implication is that for a given fixed radial distance from the galaxy s center , the 360 degree rotation circle is a equipotential surface . for spherical dark matter , such as a cno",
    ", this can only happen if the spin axis of the galaxy is aligned radially in the embedding dark matter sphere .",
    "having two spiral galaxies with no noticable azimuth angle dependence in their rotation curves allows us to determine the center of the cno by extrapolating the two spin axis back to a point , figure 1 . in practice",
    ", they will not actually cross , but join within an error volume that will be calculable .",
    "the milky way has azimuth angle dependence in its rotation curve , because of the wide variation@xcite of the rotational speed with fixed radial distance .",
    "this means that the milky way spin axis is ` canted ' in the cno spherical symmetry .      in table 1",
    ", we list the j2000 equatorial coordinates of m33 and m31 . to find the center of the cno embedding the lg",
    ", we extrapolate the m31 and m33 spin axis using a monte carlo algorithm which is described in the appendix .",
    "the spin axis of a spiral galaxy is described in reference@xcite .",
    "the spin axis unit - vector @xmath15 of m31 and m33 is given by @xmath16 with @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the declination angle and @xmath19 is the right ascension angle of the galaxy in question .",
    "the physical components are given by observables @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the axial ratio and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the position angle , with @xmath26 .",
    "we use a computer algorithm ( see appendix ) that finds the smallest extrapolated m33 and m31 spin - axis intersection for values of @xmath23 and @xmath27 within @xmath289 % of their quoted values within the literature .",
    "this will reveal the center of the cno to within a computable error .",

    "this spin axis extrapolation will reveal the approximate center of the cno which is given in table 3 ; there , the cno is designated cno - lg .",
    "the size and mass of the cno are determined by three parameters : the degenerate neutrino mass @xmath5 and two boundary conditions@xcite at the center , of which the only one that varies is @xmath31 where @xmath31 is the quantity @xmath32 at the center , with @xmath33 the fermi momentum and @xmath34 the speed of light . in general , @xmath35 from fitting galaxy clusters embedded in cno@xcite .",

    "m33 center is at a radial distance 740.423 kpc , while its 15 kpc spiral arm is at 740.575 kpc .",
    "the difference in rotation speeds is given by eq(5 ) where @xmath40 = 740.575 kpc and @xmath45 = 740.423 kpc . by requiring this to be @xmath42 40 km / s at 15 kpc from m33 center , perpendicular to the radial direction , we determine the properties of the cno embedding the lg . for @xmath46 with @xmath47 0.8 ev / c@xmath9",

    "the mathematical reason why the milky way has a higher rotational speed at 8 kpc than m33 at 15 kpc is due to the non - zero ca nt angle of milky way .",

    ". eventually the galaxy will undergo simple harmonic motion about the center@xcite .",
    "those spiral galaxies that have a non - zero ca nt angle are also expected to cartwheel about the arm closest to the cno center .",
    "if a cluster of galaxies is embedded , the center of mass of the cluster is itself expected to undergo simple harmonic motion .",
    "the back - reaction on the cno will cause it to vibrate in its spectrum of normal modes@xcite with the lowest frequency a quadrupole oscillation . in figure 3 , we show the 3-d geometry of the calculated cno solution in relationship to the local group .",
    "it should be pointed out that cno can not overlap each other ( pauli exclusion principle ) .",
    "hence , it is possible that cnos of various radii and masses could be adjacent to one another ( like kepler s stacked greengrocer oranges ) . in reference@xcite , we point out that condensed neutrinos might even form filaments between quasi - spherically shaped cnos ( bi - spherical symmetry ) .",
    "the value of @xmath47 0.8 ev / c@xmath9 violates the upper - bound limit of neutrinos published by the planck satellite consortium@xcite , based on their assumption that neutrinos ( and anti - neutrinos ) are in thermodynamic equilibrium in the early big bang , before their decoupling of matter .",
    "this thermodynamic equilibrium assumption is conventional wisdom@xcite , which does not take into account possible neutrino ( and anti - neutrino ) radiation losses .",
    "the planck satellite analysis produces other issues : the discrepancy between the hubble expansion parameter as indirectly measured by the planck satellite consortium and the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe , with its direct determination by type 1a supernova@xcite .",
    "this tension / disagreement can no longer be ignored because the discrepancy is at the 5%-9% level@xcite .",
    "what is going on ?",
    "the key here is this assumption that the cosmological black - body radiation ( cbr ) scientists make in reducing their raw data .",
    "they assume that the cosmological neutrinos are in thermodynamic equilibrium with baryonic matter right up to their decoupling and that they contibute to the perturbations on the acoustic peaks . in so doing , they constrain neutrino masses to be extremely small and they derive a small value of the hubble expansion parameter .",
    "in fact , if neutrinos radiate their energy in the early universe turbulent plasmas , they will never be in equilibrium with baryonic matter .",
    "if so , something else has to be present giving their degrees - of - freedom to the cbr .",
    "actually there is : adams et al @xcite show that a cosmic magnetic field has the same contribution to the cosmic microwave background as kinetic degrees of freedom .",
    "we anticipate that if the raw cbr data is re - processed using cosmic magnetic fields in place of neutrino ones , the discrepancy of the value of the hubble parameter should disappear .",
    "whatever dark matter is , it must have an equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "this is the key physics describing the aggregate of dark matter particles .",
    "a critical requirement is that the eos allows for stable dark matter .",
    "stability in this context means that it must be stable against its own self - gravity .",
    "some internal pressure must exist to withstand its own gravitational collapse .",
    "if dark matter is made up of bosons , it must have an internal energy source where the kinetic energy of the bosons prevents collapse .",
    "no one has shown that candidate bosons have internal energy generation that can prevent the bosons from collapsing into a black hole configuration .",
    "bosons are poor candidates for dark matter for this very reason and probably impossible for cold dark matter .",
    "fermions , on the other hand , have degeneracy pressure because of the pauli exclusion principle . we know that electron degeneracy pressure allows white dwarfs to exist , and neutron degeneracy pressure allows neutron stars to exist .",
    "if neutrinos radiate , they should condense and form stable objects .",
    "if cold dark matter is in fact a condensed object composed of neutrinos , then there are constraints that can be immediately deduced .",
    "one constraint is that these neutrinos must be cosmological in origin , since the number of neutrinos produced after the big bang is too small .",
    "next , neutrino condensation requires them to loose their kinetic energy . in eq(1 ) above , we have a natural way to do this since the early universe had huge turbulent plasmas @xcite .",
    "however , majorana neutrinos , have no permanent magnetic dipole moment , and so eq(1 ) is not available to them .",
    "we conclude that if dark matter are objects made of neutrinos , they are of the dirac - variety .",
    "most importantly , the normal set of neutrinos and their anti - neutrinos ( @xmath50 ) interact so weakly , that whatever numbers were produced in the big bang , those numbers still remain and the baryon matter - anti - matter disparity mystery does nt exist for neutrinos and their antineutrinos .",
    "thus cno satisfy the large difference between the baryonic contribution ( 17% ) to the universe matter density and the dark matter contribution ( 83%)@xcite .",
    "the katrin experiment @xcite will have the sensitivity to determine the mass of the electron anti - neutrino down to @xmath51 , well within the value of @xmath5 used here .",
    "the mass range for the degenerate neutrino mass 0.75 ev / c@xmath52 ev / c@xmath9 found from fitting galaxy cluster data@xcite is in direct contradiction to the upper bound claimed by the planck satellite consortium .",
    "if katrin discovers a neutrino mass in this range , we contend that the cbr raw data analysis must be revisited and that it would be a major finding endorsing condensed neutrinos as the so - called dark matter , which everyone has been looking for .",
    "we describe the algorithm that finds the approximate cno center for two radially - aligned spiral galaxies .",
    "let @xmath53 and @xmath54 be the vectors describing the position ( @xmath55 ) of spiral galaxy numbered 1 and a line through its spin axis ( @xmath56 ) , with spiral galaxy numbered 2 similiar .",
    "the squared - distance between them @xmath57 is @xmath58^{2}\\ ] ] we find the extremum @xmath59 , @xmath60 by solving for @xmath61 which gives the solutions @xmath62 } { [ ( \\vec{a } \\cdot \\vec{b})^{2 } -1]}\\ ] ] @xmath63 for unit spin vectors @xmath64 .",
    "we vary the axial ratio and position angle of each spiral galaxy randomly within @xmath289 % of their quoted values within the literature , determine the separation distance between the lines that those probabilty draws create and either keep them as the running smallest value or throw them away before the next probability draw series .",
    "a loop of 4 million series draws is sufficient for the approximate answer .",
