    "one of the central problems in black hole physics is the identification of the microscopic origin of black hole entropy , which obeys the relation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the area of the event horizon and @xmath3 is the planck length  @xcite .",
    "( hereafter we will set @xmath4 . )",
    "there are two important facts which suggest that the black hole entropy may have some microscopic origin .",
    "one is hawking s argument  @xcite on quantum fields in a black hole spacetime showing that the black hole emits thermal radiation with the temperature @xmath5 which is proportional to that determined by the classical 1st law for black holes @xcite with a universal coefficient .",
    "in fact , the coefficient on the right - hand side of eq.([eqn : s - bh ] ) is chosen so that @xmath5 coincides with the latter .",
    "for derivation of @xmath5 , see @xcite as well as @xcite .",
    "the other is the fact that the free energy calculated from the euclidean path integral for the pure gravity system gives in the saddle point approximation exactly the same expressions for the temperature and the entropy as those given above .",
    "on the basis of these facts and their consistency , there have been proposed various candidates for the microscopic origin of the black hole entropy  @xcite . among them",
    "the simplest one is the idea of the entanglement entropy@xcite , which focuses on the entropy associated with states of quantum fields on black hole spacetimes and is strongly motivated by the first of the above two facts .",
    "the entanglement entropy itself is quite a general concept which is nothing but coarse graining entropy for a quantum system caused by an observer s partial ignorance of the information on the state .",
    "now the idea is that the event horizon may play the role of the boundary of perception for an asymptotic observer so that its existence may give rise to the entropy .",
    "indeed for simple models on a flat spacetime@xcite explicit estimations showed that the entanglement entropy @xmath6 is always proportional to the area @xmath7 of the boundary between two regions of a spatial section of spacetime : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a cut - off scale for regularization and @xmath10 is a model - dependent coefficient of order unity .",
    "thus there is a clear similarity between @xmath6 and @xmath11 .    in order to see whether there is something deeper in this similarity ,",
    "we have constructed a kind of thermodynamics of a space boundary , which we call entanglement thermodynamics , for a massless scalar field on flat spacetime in our previous paper@xcite . there , by giving a suitable definition of the entanglement energy @xmath0 , we determined the entanglement temperature @xmath12 by imposing the first law of thermodynamics .",
    "then we compared the system of thermodynamics quantities @xmath13 obtained by this procedure with the corresponding one for black hole , @xmath14 .",
    "this comparison showed that the entanglement thermodynamics on a flat background possesses a totally different structure compared with the black hole one .",
    "it is not difficult to understood why such discrepancy occurs .",
    "since we wanted to construct thermodynamics of a space boundary , we have defined the entanglement energy @xmath0 so that it depends only on quantum degree of freedom around the space boundary . as a result , @xmath0 became proportional to the boundary area @xmath7 unlike the black hole energy @xmath15 .",
    "since the dependence of the thermodynamical quantities on the boundary area come from the very nature of the idea of entanglement , it may appear that the idea of entanglement can not have any relevance to the black hole thermodynamics beyond the similarity of the expressions for entropy .",
    "however , it is not the case .",
    "it is because gravity is not taken into account in the above argument .",
    "in fact there is a good reason to expect that the inclusion of gravity improves the situation drastically .    in black hole spacetime",
    "the energy of quantum field gets gravitational corrections , which depend on the definition of the energy . taking into account of the fact that @xmath0 depends only on modes around the boundary",
    ", the entanglement energy estimated on flat background , @xmath16 , should be identified with the energy @xmath17 measured by a killing observer located near the horizon . on the other hand , since the black hole mass used as the energy in the black hole thermodynamics corresponds to the energy measured by an observer at spatial infinity , it is natural to use the corresponding quantity @xmath18 . due to the gravitational redshift",
    ", these energies are related by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the well - known red - shift factor@xcite for a signal emitted at the boundary .",
    "let us assume that the boundary is at the proper distance @xmath21 from the horizon .",
    "then for the schwarzschild metric we obtain @xmath22 . hence from @xmath23 , if follows that @xmath24 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath6 is independent of the position of an observer once a quantum state is fixed , so @xmath25 as before .",
    "thus it is expected that the gravity effect modifies the structure of the entanglement thermodynamics so that it becomes identical to that of the black hole thermodynamics .    on the basis of these observations , in this paper",
    "we construct the entanglement thermodynamics for a massless scalar field on the schwarzschild background , and compare its structure with that of the black hole thermodynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the model used in the paper in detail , and clarify the definitions of the entanglement entropy and energy and the basic assumptions with brief explanations of their motivations .",
    "then , after explaining our regularization scheme , we derive general formulas for the entanglement entropy and energy of the regularized system and estimate them numerically in  3 and  4 . on the basis of these results ,",
    "we compare the structure of the entanglement thermodynamics for the massless scalar field in the schwarzschild background with that of the black hole in  5 .",
    "in order to construct the entanglement thermodynamics of a black hole , we must make clear how to implement the idea of entanglement into a quantum field system on a black hole spacetime , and give the definitions of the basic thermodynamical quantities in terms of the quantum fields .",
    "the basic idea of the entanglement thermodynamics is to express the thermodynamical quantities for a black hole in terms of expectation values of quantum operators dependent on the spacetime division as in the statistical mechanics modeling of the thermodynamics for ordinary systems .",
    "therefore we must specify how to divide spacetime into two regions and with respect to what kind of state the expectation values are taken .    according to the original idea of entanglement , it is clearly most natural to consider a dynamical spacetime describing black hole formation from a nearly flat spacetime in the past infinity , and divide the spacetime into the regions inside and outside the horizon . in this situation , if we start from the asymptotic minkowski vacuum in the past , the entanglement entropy associated with the division of spacetime by the horizon acquires a clear physical meaning .",
    "however , this ideal modeling cause difficulties .",
    "the most serious one is caused by the occurrence of the hawking radiation : its contribution to the entanglement entropy diverges .",
    "of course , if the backreaction effect is properly taken into account , this divergence may disappear .",
    "but such a modeling is intractable at present and is beyond the scope of the present paper .    in order to avoid this difficulty",
    ", we replace the problem by a stationary one on the basis of the following arguments .",
    "first , consider a situation in which a thin spherical shell with a tiny mass @xmath26 infalls toward the origin to form a schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath26 .",
    "in this situation , the timelike killing surface @xmath27 with @xmath28 in the minkowski region turns to the horizon after the passage of the shell .",
    "two things happen in this process : a division of spacetime by the horizon and a change of geometry . among these two things ,",
    "the latter is responsible for the hawking radition , because the hawking radiation is essentially determined by the geometry near the horizon in the geometrical optics approximation .",
    "meanwhile , the division of spacetime produces the entropy of the black hole in our approach based on the entanglement .",
    "thus , we can determine the entropy of the black hole avoiding the above difficulty caused by the hawking radition , if we calculate the entanglement entropy associated with the division of minkowski spacetime by the timelike surface @xmath27 starting from the minkowski vacuum .",
    "because we need to introduce a cut - off length @xmath9 of the order of the planck length @xmath29 , a natural minimum value of @xmath30 is determined by the condition @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding value of the entropy becomes of order unity .",
    "next , let us consider a thin spherical shell with a tiny mass @xmath32 infalling toward the center in a schwarzschild background spacetime with mass @xmath33 .",
    "after the passege of the mass shell , a schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath34 is formed . as in the previous case , this process produces a new horizon which divides the spacetime by a null surface corresponding to the stationary timelike surface @xmath27 with @xmath35 before the passege of the shell , and slightly modifies the geometry .",
    "if we apply the reasoning in the previous case to the present situation , we can expect that the entropy of the new black hole is given by the entanglement entropy for quantum fields in the killing vacuum state , associated with the division of the schwarzschild spacetime by the timelike surface @xmath27 before the passage of the shell . here",
    ", the killing vacuum state should be taken in order to avoid the hawking radiation .",
    "now the minimum value of @xmath30 is determined by the condition that the increase of the area of the horizon is of order @xmath36 , which corresponds to an increase of entropy of order unity . for this minimum value ,",
    "the proper distance of @xmath27 to the original horizon becomes of order @xmath9 if @xmath37 .",
    "on the basis of these arguments , in this paper , we consider a quantum field in the killing vacuum state in the schwarzschild background with mass @xmath33 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and calculate the entanglement entropy and the entanglement energy to be defined later associated with the division of the spacetime by a timelike surface @xmath27 at a proper distance of the order of a cut - off length(@xmath40 ) to the horizon .",
    "since there is no definite criterion on the exact position of the boundary in our framework , we will also investigate the influence of the variation of its position .    here",
    "a subtlety occurs : if we require that the quantum field is in the killing vacuum state on the whole extended kruscal spacetime and take the horizon as the boundary surface , then the entanglement entropy vanishes because the state is expressed as the tensor product of the killing states in the regions i and ii ( _ figure _ [ fig : kruskal ] ) .",
    "this triviality comes from the fact that the quantum degree of freedom on the horizon is completely eliminated for such a state . in order to avoid this",
    ", we restrict the spacetime into the region i , and replace the boundary by a time - like surface @xmath27 at a proper distance of the order of the cut - off length ( typically , planck length ) of the theory to the horizon  .",
    "the boundary @xmath27 can be regarded as a would - be horizon when matter fields ( a real scalar field in our analysis in this paper ) , which contribute to the entanglement entropy , falls into the black hole .",
    "evidently , the would - be horizon must be very close to the horizon since our analysis is semi - classical one .",
    "however , because of the existence of the cut - off length there is the minimum proper length between the would - be and the present horizon : it must be of order of the cut - off length .",
    "hence it is natural to take as the boundary a timelike surface at a proper distance of the order of the cut - off length to the horizon .",
    "this prescription is expected to give a correct estimate of the thermodynamical quantities for the case in which the spacetime is divided by the horizon and the quantum state inside the horizon is arbitrary specified because the entanglement quantities depend only on the degrees of freedom within the distance of the order of the cut - off length from the boundary .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that we have no definite criterion regarding the exact position of the boundary . to minimize this ambiguity",
    ", we will also investigate the influence of the variation of the boundary position .    as a matter content we consider a real scalar field described by @xmath41 the mass @xmath42 does not play an essential role since a typical length scale controlling the entanglement thermodynamics is much smaller than the compton length of a usual field .",
    "therefore we just set @xmath43 in the numerical computations .",
    "there is no difficulty in generalizing the entanglement entropy for the flat case@xcite to the case of schwarzshild background .",
    "in contrast , with regards to the definition of the entanglement energy , we can not simply extend the definition used for the flat case@xcite due to the difference in the method of implementation of the idea of entanglement as well as due to the existence of the black hole mass in the present case .    before discussing the definition of the entanglement energy ,",
    "let us first recall the standard general procedure of building a statistical mechanics model for thermodynamics . let @xmath44 be a subsystem surrounded by the environment @xmath45 . for a quasi - static process , the first law of thermodynamics for the subsystem @xmath44 is expressed as @xmath46 here @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the thermodynamical energy , entropy and temperature of @xmath44 , respectively , @xmath50 is a generalized force applied to @xmath44 , and @xmath51 is a generalized displacement . now the statistical mechanics model of this thermodynamics is constructed by the following sequence of steps :    ( a ) : :    assign a microscopic model to @xmath44 and construct a    hamiltonian system for it .",
    "( b ) : :    make statistical assumptions ( e.g. the principle of equi - weight ) which    define averaging procedures for the microscopic variables .",
    "( c ) : :    identify the thermodynamical variables with quantities constructed    from the microscopic variables introduced in @xmath52 along    with the averaging procedure in @xmath53 .",
    "( d ) : :    reproduce the relations between the thermodynamical variables    ( thermodynamical laws in particular ) .",
    "since the basic idea of the entanglement thermodynamics is to construct a statistical mechanics model of the black hole thermodynamics using the idea of entanglement , we should also follow a similar procedure to this general one in defining @xmath0 .    in our case",
    "it is natural to regard the scalar field in the region inside the boundary @xmath27 as the subsystem @xmath44 , and the scalar field in the region outside @xmath27 as the environment @xmath45 .",
    "then , if we decompose the hamiltonian @xmath54 corresponding to the killing energy to the parts dependent on the microscopic degrees of freedom inside @xmath27 , those outside @xmath27 and both as @xmath55 , the most natural choice of the microscopic variable for @xmath0 is the operator @xmath56 . clearly the averaging procedure is given by taking the expectation value with respect to the killing vacuum of the total hamiltonian @xmath54 .",
    "hence we are led to the definition    ( i ) : :    @xmath57 ,    where @xmath58 denotes the normal ordering with respect to the ground state of @xmath56 .    here",
    "note that the choice    ( i ) : :    @xmath59    is essentially same as @xmath60 in spite of its appearance , as we will see in sec.[sec : energy ] .",
    "it is because @xmath0 measures a sort of disturbance to the vacuum state caused by the boundary @xmath27 , and its value is determined just by the modes around @xmath27 .",
    "hence the difference between @xmath60 and @xmath61 comes from a tiny difference in the redshift effect on the modes just inside @xmath27 and just outside @xmath27 .",
    "these choices should be contrasted with the definition of the energy in the standard argument of black hole thermodynamics . there",
    "the energy is given by the black hole mass @xmath33 , which is quite natural in the framework in which the backreaction of matter on gravity is consistently taken into account .",
    "however , in the present case , the option    ( ii ) : :    @xmath62 ,    lacks charm in our framework because it is not related to microscopic degrees of freedom . of course , it may be reasonable to replace the definition ( i ) by    ( iii ) : :    @xmath63 ,    in the sense that it represents a kind of total energy of the system consisting of the scalar field and the gravitational field .",
    "here we should comment on a subtlety of the role of @xmath33 in our model .",
    "since we are neglecting the backreaction of the matter on gravity , the black hole mass @xmath33 determining the background geometry @xmath64 might be regarded as the external parameter @xmath51 in the above expression for the 1st law of thermodynamics . however , since the killing vacuum state depends on @xmath33 as we will see later , @xmath33 becomes a function of thermodynamical variables @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "thus in effect the term @xmath65 in eq.([eqn:1stlaw ] ) does not appear in the present case@xcite .",
    "is determined by the rindler temperature . ]    because there is no firm ground to pick up one of these , we will investigate all of them .",
    "further , for the sake of comparison with the result in the flat spacetime models discussed in our previous paper@xcite , we also calculate the quantities defined by    ( @xmath66 ) : :    @xmath67 , ( @xmath68 ) : :    @xmath69 .    here",
    "@xmath70 and @xmath71 denote the normal products with respect to the ground states of @xmath54 and @xmath72 , respectively , and @xmath73 indicates the expectation value with respect to the density matrix @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the reduced density matrices for the inside and the outside of @xmath27 , respectively@xcite .",
    "finally we comment on the regularization . in dealing with the matter field",
    ", we naturally encounter the ultraviolet divergence .",
    "we adopt here the cut - off regularization by introducing the length scale @xmath9 , which is supposed to be of order of @xmath77 . on dimensional grounds",
    "we expect that @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "thus the entanglement temperature @xmath80 is expected to be independent of the cut - off scale @xmath9 .",
    "we will see later that this is the case except for the definitions @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "in order to estimate the entanglement entropy and the entanglement energy for the scalar field on the schwarzschild spacetime , we first regularize the field theory described by eq.([eqn : action ] ) and reduce it to a discrete canonical system described by a hamiltonian of the following form : @xmath83 where @xmath84 @xmath85 are canonical pairs . here",

    "if we expand the scalar field @xmath89 in terms of the real spherical harmonics as @xmath90 the action becomes a simple sum of the contributions from each mode @xmath91 .",
    "here @xmath92 , @xmath93 for @xmath94 and @xmath95 , respectively , with @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is a suitable radial coordinate .",
    "hence if we discretize this radial coordinate , we obtain a regularized system .    as the radial coordinate",

    "we adopt the former since the later makes the killing energy divergent .",
    "now it is straightforward to perform the canonical transformation .",

    "we adopt the middle - point prescription in discretizing the terms including a derivative : we replace a term , say , @xmath114 by @xmath115 .",

    "we have numerically evaluated @xmath227 , @xmath205 @xmath228 and @xmath214 .",
    "now we have taken the numerical outer boundary at @xmath229 .",
    "the truncation in the @xmath159-summation is the same as for @xmath6 ( up to @xmath230 $ ] ) , which implies that the accuracy is about @xmath231 from the above asymptotic estimate for @xmath232 .",
    "the results of numerical calculations are shown in _ figure _ [ fig : e - i ] , _ figure _ [ fig : e - i ] , _ figure _ [ fig : e - iv-1 ] and _ figure _ [ fig : e - iv-2 ] . in these figures , @xmath233 is plotted as a function of @xmath234 for @xmath235 .",
    "all of these figures show that @xmath236 is proportional to @xmath237 : @xmath238 note that the identity @xmath239 holds from the definitions .    from these equations",
    "we immediately see that the values of @xmath227 and @xmath205 coincide except for a tiny difference independent of @xmath169 . as was mentioned in sec.[subsec : energy ] , this difference is understood by the gravitational red - shift : @xmath227 comes from the modes just inside @xmath27 while @xmath205 originates from the modes just outside @xmath27 . in the present numerical calculations ,",
    "it means that @xmath227 and @xmath205 are determined by the modes at @xmath240 and @xmath241 , respectively(see eq.([eqn : vlm ] ) ) .",
    "hence , taking account of the fact that the contribution of each mode to the entanglement energy is proportional to the red - shift factor at its location , the ratio of @xmath227 and @xmath205 should be approximately given by @xmath242 this is consistent with the above numerical result .",
    "this argument is also supported by the numerical result for the flat spacetime model shown in _ figure _ [ fig : e - i - flat ] . in this figure",
    "the values of @xmath227 and @xmath205 for a massless scalar field in the minkowski spacetime with @xmath243 are plotted . in this case",
    "there is no gravitational red - shift effect , so we expect that @xmath244 , as confirmed by the numerical calculation .",
    "now on the basis of our results for @xmath6 and @xmath0 , let us compare the structure of the entanglement thermodynamics with that of black hole .    from the numerical results in  3 and  4 , the entanglement entropy @xmath6 and the entanglement energy @xmath0 for our model",
    "are expressed as @xmath245 where @xmath246 here and hereafter we will only consider the horizon limit , @xmath247 .",
    "it is helpful to keep in mind that the case @xmath248 along with @xmath249 corresponds to the black hole thermodynamics . in eq.([eqn : summarys ] ) is the area of the boundary and it differs from the area of the horizon .",
    "however we here ignore the difference since it is totally negligible as compared with @xmath2 itself .",
    "similarly @xmath250 so that we can safely set @xmath251 in the present context . ]    from these expressions and the first law of thermodynamics @xmath252 the entanglement temperature @xmath12 is determined as @xmath253 thus we get @xmath254 these results have several interesting features .",
    "first of all we immediately see that the entanglement thermodynamics on the schwarzschild spacetime show exactly the same behavior as the black hole thermodynamics , as summarized in _ table _ [ table : comparison ] .",
    "this behavior is just what we expected from the intuitive argument in the introduction : the gravitational redshift effect modifies the area dependence of @xmath0 so as to make the entanglement thermodynamics behave just like the black hole thermodynamics .",
    "second it should be noted that the temperature @xmath12 becomes independent of the cut - off scale @xmath9 only for the options type @xmath60 and @xmath255 ( i.e. @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath256 and @xmath257 ) .",
    "this indicates that ( ii ) and ( iii ) are not good definitions of the energy in our approach .",
    "it is also suggestive that the average @xmath258 gives almost the same value as @xmath5 .",
    "this averaging corresponds to averaging out the difference in the red - shift factors for the one - mesh ` inside ' and the one - mesh ` outside ' of the boundary .",
    "therefore such an averaging may have some meaning .",
    "to summarize , our model analysis strongly suggests a tight connection between the entanglement thermodynamics and the black hole thermodynamics .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that matter fields on a black hole spacetime capture the background characteristics .",
    "of course , our model is too simple to give any definite conclusion based on it . in particular",
    ", the ambiguity in the definition of the energy comes from neglecting backreaction of the quantum field on gravity .",
    "further , even in the fixed background framework , our model is too simple in that its thermodynamics is essentially controlled by one parameter corresponding to the black hole mass .",
    "it is obviously useful to see whether the entanglement thermodynamics is consistent with the black hole thermodynamics for models with more parameters , such as those on the reisner - nordstrom spacetime or on the kerr spacetime before attacking the difficult task of going beyond the semi - classical approximation .",
