    "in high - energy heavy - ion collisions , one of the pressing issues is the direct determination of the initial parton density of the dense medium and its formation time .",
    "jet quenching or attenuation of leading particles from jet fragmentation can provide an effective tool to measure directly the parton density of the medium with which the jet interacts strongly during its propagation .",
    "recent theoretical studies @xcite have shown that parton energy loss via induced radiation is directly related to the gluon density of the medium .",
    "the attenuation will suppress the final leading hadron distribution giving rise to modified parton fragmentation functions @xcite . by measuring the medium modification of the fragmentation function one",
    "can thus extract the effective parton energy loss .",
    "most importantly , one can compare the effective parton energy loss extracted from heavy - ion collisions to that of cold nuclei and extract the initial parton density of the hot dense medium relative to a cold nucleus .",
    "in deeply inelastic scattering ( dis ) off a nuclear target , a quark suffers multiple scattering with other nucleons inside the nucleus after it was knocked out of its parent nucleon .",
    "the induced gluon bremsstrahlung before hadronization leads to suppression of leading hadrons and gives rise to a modified quark fragmentation function . including the leading twist-4 contributions from double scattering processes , the nuclear medium induced correction to the fragmentation function is found to be similar to the radiative correction in the vacuum except that the normal splitting functions are replaced by the modified ones .",
    "these modified splitting functions are found @xcite to depend on the quark - gluon correlation function @xmath0 .",
    "here @xmath1 and @xmath2 is the twist - two quark distribution of the nucleus .",
    "such a two - parton correlation function contains essentially four independent twist-4 parton matrix elements in a nucleus [ @xmath3 .",
    "the dipole - like form - factor @xmath4 arises from the interference between the final state radiation of the @xmath5 scattering and the gluon bremsstrahlung induced by the secondary quark - gluon scattering . by generalizing the factorization assumption to these twist - four parton matrices ,",
    "we have @xmath6 with a gaussian nuclear distribution @xmath7 , @xmath8 fm . here ,",
    "@xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the nucleon mass .",
    "since the two interference terms in the dipole - like form - factor involve transferring momentum @xmath11 between different nucleons inside a nucleus , they should be suppressed for large nuclear size or large momentum fraction @xmath12 . notice that @xmath13 is the gluon s formation time .",
    "thus , @xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the nuclear size in the infinite momentum frame .",
    "the effective parton correlation and the induced gluon emission vanishes when the formation time is much larger than the nuclear size , @xmath16 , because of the landau - pomeranchuck - migdal ( lpm ) interference effect .",
    "therefore , the lpm interference restricts the radiated gluon to have a minimum transverse momentum @xmath17 .",
    "the nuclear corrections to the fragmentation function due to double parton scattering will then be in the order of @xmath18 , which depends quadratically on the nuclear size . for large values of @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ", these corrections are leading ; yet the requirement @xmath21 for the logarithmic approximation in deriving the modified fragmentation function is still valid .    shown in fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] are the calculated nuclear modification factor of the fragmentation functions for @xmath22 and @xmath23 targets as compared to the recent hermes data @xcite .",
    "the predicted shape of the @xmath24- and and energy dependence agrees well with the experimental data .",
    "a remarkable feature of the prediction is the quadratic @xmath25 nuclear size dependence , which is verified for the first time by an experiment .",
    "the only parameter in our calculation is found to be @xmath26 gev@xmath27 with @xmath28 at @xmath29 gev@xmath27 .    )",

    "to extend our study to jets in heavy - ion collisions , we assume @xmath38 ( the debye screening mass ) and a gluon density profile @xmath39 for a 1-dimensional expanding system . since the initial jet production rate is independent of the final gluon density which can be related to the parton - gluon scattering cross section @xcite [ @xmath40 , one has then @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the gluon formation time .",
    "one can recover the form of energy loss in a thin plasma obtained in the opacity expansion approach @xcite , @xmath43 where we have assumed @xmath44 ( @xmath45=1 for @xmath46 and 9/4 for @xmath47 scattering ) .    neglecting the logarithmic dependence on @xmath48 ,",
    "the averaged energy loss in a 1-dimensional expanding system can be expressed as @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the energy loss in a static medium with the same gluon density @xmath51 as in a 1-d expanding system at an initial time @xmath52 .",
    "because of the expansion , the averaged energy loss @xmath53 is suppressed as compared to the static case and does not depend linearly on the system size .",
    "similarly , one have the total transverse momentum broadening in an expanding system , @xmath54    fitting the phenix data @xcite on suppression of large @xmath55 @xmath56 spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] yields @xmath57 gev / fm .",
    "taking into account the expansion , this would be equivalent to @xmath58 in a static system with the same gluon density as the initial value of the expanding system at @xmath52 . with @xmath59 fm and assuming @xmath60 fm",
    ", this would give @xmath61 gev / fm for a 10-gev parton , since the parton energy loss is directly proportional to gluon density of the medium , this implies that the gluon density in the initial stage of @xmath37 collisions at @xmath62 fm/@xmath63 is about 15 times higher than that inside a cold nucleus . to extract the parton density and the initial formation time",
    ", one has to measure the energy loss and @xmath64 broadening simultaneously .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we also show the predicted suppression factor at large @xmath55 with the same logarithmic energy - dependence of the energy loss as in the cold nuclear matter which gives a suppression factor that increases with @xmath55 . however , new rhic data @xcite at 200 gev show a constant suppression factor at larger @xmath55 .",
    "this indicates the importance of the detailed balance @xcite which gives much stronger energy dependence of the energy loss .",
    "we show as the lower dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the result for an effective parton energy loss @xmath65 which is parameterized according to the result from ref .",
    "@xcite where both stimulated gluon emission and thermal absorption are included in the calculation of the total energy loss .",
    "the detailed balance between emission and absorption reduces the effective parton energy loss and on the other hand increases the energy dependence .",
    "the threshold is the consequence of gluon absorption that competes with radiation that effectively shuts off the energy loss .",
