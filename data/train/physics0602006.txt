    "arcade type magnetic structures play an essential role in solar physics , particularly regarding the coronal loops , coronal heating and coronal mass ejection . a typical coronal loop",
    "consists of a bunch or a single arch - like magnetic field line(s ) joining two magnetically active regions of opposite polarity on the photosphere @xcite .",
    "the active regions themselves are separated by a neutral line , where the normal component of the magnetic field is zero . in general the coronal loops",
    "are observed to be _ long - lived_. by _ long - lived _ we mean the life - time of the structure involved is more than that expected from a conventional magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) analysis . the coronal loops are seen to have life - times varying from an hour to more than one day @xcite whereas the mhd time scale for a typical loop parameter is of the order of seconds @xcite only .",
    "the global structure of the magnetic arcades are modelled either by assuming a potential ( current - free ) field @xcite or by considering the plasma to be force - free @xcite and the magnetic field satisfying the equation    @xmath0    with @xmath1 as a spatial function or a constant .",
    "the fff model is justified by an an order of magnitude analysis that shows the structures to be of low @xmath2 @xcite or on arguments similar to that of taylor in the context of laboratory plasmas @xcite , where it is envisioned as a relaxed state characterized by the magnetic energy minimum along with an invariant magnetic helicity @xcite .",
    "the second scheme appears to be more lucrative , since by definition it makes the arcade structures long - lived and at the same time imparts a sense of stability to them .",
    "this stems from the fact that the relaxed state being a spontaneously achieved state , any deviation from it is expected to generate the same mechanisms that were responsible to attain the relaxed state at the very first place . as a result ,",
    "the system will once again try to converge to its earlier state and the perturbations will die out .",
    "in other words , there is always an anticipation that the relaxed states are also inherently stable by nature .",
    "but this is only an expectation and a detail analysis @xcite is always required to study the relevant stability properties .",
    "although the force - free description is successful in explaining the gross topological features of the magnetic arcades but at the same time also suffers from major drawbacks .",
    "as observed through euv spectrum @xcite the plasma temperature has a monotonically increasing profile inside the loop being minimum at the axis and maximum at the surface .",
    "the density shows no significant variation transverse to the loop axis @xcite and even can be considered to be uniform @xcite .",
    "these observations imply that the pressure is not an uniform parameter inside the loop and a force - free description may not be an appropriate candidate to model the arcade . in a recent work by g. a. gary @xcite",
    "it has been recognized that the solar corona itself has regions of different plasma @xmath2 .",
    "it is only the mid - corona sandwiched between the photosphere at the base of the coronal loop and the upper - corona where the plasma @xmath3 and the force - free condition can be assumed to hold good .",
    "the other two regions are essentially characterized by @xmath4 and hence support non force - free fields .",
    "based on the sxt limb data @xcite , gary has proposed a model that admits a range of @xmath2 values in the mid corona . also in an alternative scenario the solar flares are proposed to be natural consequence of the high @xmath2 plasma confined in a curved coronal loop @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned works essentially points that a force - free model is not adequate in explaining all the features of arcade fields and a non force - free description is highly desirable .",
    "another feature missing in the force - free description of the arcade fields is the plasma flow . in all the force - free models mentioned above",
    ", the plasma is assumed to be ideal or nearly ideal .",
    "this essentially decouples the magnetic and flow fields , making them independent of each other .",
    "in contrast to this finite plasma flows have been observed in the coronal loops @xcite , a typical form being the evershed flow which is directed out of the sunspots at the photosphere and into them in the chromosphere @xcite . a finite pressure difference between the foot points",
    "is believed to be responsible for such flows .",
    "flows are important in context of the solar winds also where the plasma is seen to flow outwards along the open field lines .",
    "the importance of flow has recently been recognized by mahajan _ et .",
    "@xcite also .",
    "according to them viscous dissipation does play an important role as long as the flow field is treated as an integral part of the plasma dynamics and accounts for the coronal heating during the very formation of the loops .    from the above discussions it emerges that although the force - free model is suitable in explaining the gross topological features of the arcade - type magnetic fields , further studies must be made in order to accommodate features such as non - uniform pressure profile and finite plasma flow . to include such features , in the following we propose the arcade fields as driven relaxed states governed by the principle of _ minimum dissipation rate _ ( mdr ) . before going any further",
    ", we want to declare that our goal is rather modest and is confined only to the feasibility study of the arcade structures as mdr relaxed state . in this paper",
    "we will be more concerned with the general topological features and leave all the quantitative analysis ; like the heating rate or the magnitude of the plasma flow for future works . also for analytical progress , essential in understanding the natural coupling of the self - consistent magnetic fields and non - zero plasma flows , we will assume the density to be constant .",
    "the situations where such an assumption is valid being already been discussed by mahajan _ et . al _",
    "@xcite , no further clarifications are given here .",
    "to formulate a variational problem for obtaining the relaxed state , we need a minimizer ( minimization of which yields the relaxed state ) and invariants or constraints that essentially determines how far the system will be propped away from its trivial outcome .",
    "a crucial point to be noted is , most of the arcade fields , including the solar corona , are externally driven magnetoplasma systems . for the solar corona ,",
    "the external drive is provided by the convective motions in the bounding photospheric surface penetrated by the coronal magnetic field @xcite . with dissipative processes playing a key role @xcite , such systems are not in thermodynamic equilibrium and we have to look for suitable minimizers and invariants .",
    "principle of minimum dissipation rate first proposed by montgomery and philips in the context of plasma physics @xcite is one of the suitable candidates to describe such off - equilibrium magnetoplasma systems related to various fusion oriented configurations @xcite ( and the references therein ) .",
    "we must point out that in absence of a rigorous mathematical proof , principle of mdr still enjoys the status of a conjecture- the validity of which depends on the agreement of predictions based on it with the experimental observations .",
    "the success of mdr in predicting experimentally realizable relaxed states in laboratory plasmas makes it a viable candidate for the astrophysical plasmas also .    in the following",
    "we describe the plasma by two - fluid equations .",
    "this has two basic advantages over its single - fluid or mhd counterpart . in two - fluid description , at - least in context of the relaxation physics , plasma flow",
    "gets coupled to the magnetic field in a natural way .",
    "also , the two - fluid description being more general than mhd , it is expected to capture certain results that are otherwise unattainable from a single - fluid description . in two - fluid formalism",
    "the magnetic helicity is replaced by the generalized helicities defined as    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the canonical momentum and canonical vorticity for the @xmath8 species and are given by    @xmath9    as can easily be acknowledged , the expression for @xmath10 in equation ( 2 ) is gauge independent only if the boundary condition @xmath11 is satisfied .",
    "such a boundary condition makes the system to be isolated from the surroundings . to accommodate arcade structures , which are inherently driven systems @xcite",
    ", we must modify the above definition of generalized helicity .",
    "an alternative expression for the generalized helicity can be found by extending the definition of jensen and chu @xcite to the two - fluid case .",
    "let us define @xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath6 and @xmath13 are different inside the volume of interest and are same outside .",
    "the gauge invariance can easily be seen by writing @xmath14 , @xmath15 being some arbitrary scalar continuous at the boundary .    @xmath16    where the surface integral is to be evaluated over the bounding surface @xmath17 of the volume @xmath18 .",
    "in writing the above equation we have used the gauss theorem along with the fact that @xmath19 .",
    "so the generalized helicity @xmath10 as defined by equation ( 4 ) is gauge invariant provided the boundary condition    @xmath20    is obeyed .",
    "if we further assume that there is no flow - field coupling at the surface i.e. , the flow and the magnetic fields are two independent variables and the variation of one does not affect the other , we have    @xmath21    at the surface , where    @xmath22    is the vorticity . equations ( 7 ) then represent a type of natural boundary conditions inherent to the problem . next , with generalized helicity given by equation ( 4 ) , in the following we derive the helicity balance equation .    for the @xmath8 component the momentum balance equation",
    "is given by ,    @xmath23    where we have assumed the flow to be incompressible and @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the gravitational potential and @xmath26 is the pressure .",
    "writing @xmath27 and using the vector identity    @xmath28    the momentum balance equation can be cast as ,    @xmath29 + { \\bf{u}}_\\alpha\\times{\\bf{\\omega}}_\\alpha \\nonumber\\\\ & & -\\frac{\\mu_\\alpha}{n_\\alpha}(\\nabla\\times)^2{\\bf{u}}_\\alpha -\\frac{q_\\alpha\\eta c}{4\\pi}(\\nabla\\times){\\bf{b}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have used the notation @xmath30to n terms . taking curl on both sides , we get the vorticity balance equation as    @xmath31    using the above two equations along with the definition ( 4 ) for the generalized helicity , corresponding balance equation for the @xmath8 component is obtained as ,    @xmath32{\\bf{\\omega}}_\\alpha^\\prime\\cdot\\hat{n}da-\\oint({\\bf{p}}_\\alpha \\cdot{\\bf{\\omega}}_\\alpha){\\bf{u}}_\\alpha\\cdot\\hat{n}da \\nonumber\\\\ & -&\\oint\\left(\\frac{\\partial{\\bf{p}}_\\alpha^\\prime}{\\partial t }   \\times{\\bf{p}}_\\alpha^\\prime\\right)\\cdot\\hat{n}da   -\\eta_\\alpha^\\prime\\oint[\\{\\nabla\\times{\\bf{b}}+l_\\alpha   { \\bf{\\omega}}_\\alpha)\\}\\times{\\bf{p}}_\\alpha]\\cdot\\hat{n}da \\\\   & -&2\\eta_\\alpha^\\prime\\int[\\nabla\\times({\\bf{b}}+l_\\alpha   { \\bf{\\omega}}_\\alpha)]\\cdot{\\bf{\\omega}}_\\alpha d\\tau \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with    @xmath33 \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\eta_\\alpha^\\prime=\\frac{q_\\alpha\\eta c}{4\\pi } \\nonumber\\\\   & & \\\\   & & l_\\alpha=\\frac{4\\pi}{q_\\alpha c   n_\\alpha}\\frac{\\mu_\\alpha}{\\eta}\\equiv~~{\\rm{prandtl~~number}}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    while deriving the above equation , we have used the boundary condition described by equation ( 6 ) . in the above balance equation the surface integrals represent the helicity injection terms while the volume integral represents the dissipation rate for @xmath10 . for an isolated system characterized by @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( the last condition is due to the fact that in isolated systems with conducting material boundary , @xmath37 and @xmath38 which is the no - slip boundary condition and is applicable to viscous systems ) , only the dissipation term in the balance equation survives and for a static plasma characterized by @xmath39 is similar to the dissipation rate of the magnetic helicity .    to proceed further , in the following we consider a two - component hydrogen plasma . neglecting the electron mass over the ion mass with @xmath40 and the quasineutrality to hold good",
    ", we have    @xmath41    in writing the last expression we have neglected the electron viscosity over the ion viscosity due to its smallness by the electron to ion mass ratio .",
    "following montgomery _",
    "et al _ @xcite , let us assume that @xmath42 is a bounded function .",
    "then the time average of @xmath42 over a reasonably long time will make left side of the above equation a constant .",
    "prescribing the surface terms @xcite then it is possible to form a variational problem where the relaxed state is obtained by minimizing the total dissipation rates , both ohmic and viscous , with the helicity dissipation rates as constraints . in other words , in our model",
    "we have assumed the field variables to be fixed at the surface .",
    "this assumption is more of a mathematical requirement to keep the subsequent analysis simple and at per with the variational principle in classical mechanics . the minimization integral is then obtained as ,    @xmath43d\\tau \\nonumber\\\\   & + & \\lambda_i\\int[\\nabla\\times({\\bf{b}}+l_i{\\bf{\\omega}}_i)]\\cdot{\\bf{\\omega_i } }   d\\tau-\\lambda_e\\int(\\nabla\\times{\\bf{b}})\\cdot{\\bf{\\omega}}_e   d\\tau   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first two terms in the above integral represents the ohmic and viscous dissipation rates while the second two integrals represent the ion and electron generalized helicity dissipation rates . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the corresponding lagrange undetermined multipliers .",

    "the equations reduce to the double - curl beltrami equations obtained by mahajan and yoshida @xcite .",
    "also the equations are in some sense robust to a variation in the prandtl number .",
    "for both the limits @xmath56 and @xmath57 and for finite @xmath58 the equations maintain their double - curl nature .",
    "as the finite @xmath58 case also includes the ideal limit ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) , this shows that the flow does play an important role in securing a relaxed as well as a steady - state in the ideal limit , as conjectured by montgomery and philips @xcite .",

    "the euler - lagrange equations obtained are double - curl in nature and represent non force - free configuration . for a constant gauge this reduces to the double curl beltrami equation obtained by mahajan and yoshida @xcite .",
    "since the double - curl beltrami equation represents one of the steady states of the ideal plasma , this highlights the possible role of the non - zero plasma flow in securing a steady , as well as , mdr relaxed state .    to establish the plausibility of mdr principle in predicting arcade structures",
    ", an attempt has been made to solve the euler - lagrange equations in terms of chadrasekhar - kendall eigenfunctions subject to the arcade geometry in cartesian coordinates with axisymmetry .",
    "a solution is obtained for the two - dimensional case characterized by @xmath108 .",
    "one interesting feature supported by this new relaxed state is the prediction of continuous transition from the single arcades to multiple arcade type solutions with increase in the eigenvalue @xmath110 .",
    "a particular case of interest is the observation of triple - arcade structures as the mdr relaxed state .",
    "the importance of such structures can be realized from the recent lasco observations on soho spacecraft that suggest the helmet streamers originating from the sun may have an internal triple - arcade structure @xcite .",
    "also a hypothetical picture of cme can be postulated where the arcades transit from multiplets to singlets before the instability threshold @xmath124 is achieved .",
    "this is consistent with the recent findings that the triple streamers are more stable than the single ones @xcite .",
    "in addition , the relaxed state predicts self - consistent plasma flow , which for the single - arcade solutions resembles the evershed type .",
    "the above findings definitely points out that the mdr relaxed states applied to astrophysical plasmas is a worthy case for further investigations .",
    "any such investigation should involve all the three components of the magnetic field . only then it will be possible to study the effects of twist on the field lines . in principle , this should generate knots and further studies can be made on the predictability of @xmath17-shaped solar prominences .",

    "<S> arcade - type magnetic field structures originating from the photosphere are relevant to the understanding of different types of solar prominences , coronal loops and coronal heating . in most of the existing literature , </S>",

    "<S> the system is assumed to be isolated and non - dissipative . in reality </S>",
    "<S> the photospheric plasma hardly qualifies to be isolated in nature and the existence of an external drive in the form of a dynamo field is always possible . </S>",
    "<S> solar prominences are not ideal either since dissipative effects are believed to play a major role in coronal heating . </S>",
    "<S> the above observations indicate that a force - free model based on a non - dissipative plasma may not be a suitable candidate to replicate the arcade structures and further investigations are required . in our work , we have proposed the arcade structures as minimum dissipative relaxed states ( including both the viscous and resistive channels ) pertaining to a two - fluid description of the plasma . the obtained relaxed state is non force - free in nature and appropriate to an open system with external drives . </S>",
    "<S> the euler - lagrange equations are solved in cartesian coordinates subject to the existing photospheric boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions are seen to support flow - containing arcade like magnetic field configurations with inherent dissipative properties that may play an important role in the coronal heating . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting feature observed is the generation of different types of arcades with the variation of a single parameter characterizing the relaxed state . </S>",
    "<S> also , recent observations with the lasco coronagraph on board the soho spacecraft suggest that the helmet streamers originating from the sun may have an internal triple - arcade structure . the two - fluid relaxed state obtained here is also seen to support such structures . </S>"
