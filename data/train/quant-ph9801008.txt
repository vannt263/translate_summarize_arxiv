    "the ability to control preparation and evolution of states of quantum systems opens new horizons in experimental physics ( e.g. tests of fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics ) as well as in potential technical applications ( such as quantum information processing ) .",
    "recent advances in quantum optics ( micromasers , cavity qed ) @xcite and atomic physics ( dynamics of trapped ions ) @xcite have demonstrated that a macroscopic observer can effectively control dynamics as well as to perform a complete measurement of states of microscopic quantum systems . in particular , preparation of an _ arbitrary _ quantum states of",
    "a _ single _ mode electromagnetic field in micromasers and 1-dimensional vibrational motion of trapped ions have been discussed in literature @xcite .",
    "experimental realizations of highly non - classical states , such as fock states , squeezed states or schrdinger - cat states of these _ single_-mode bosonic fields have been reported @xcite .",
    "the ability to synthesize an arbitrary motional state is a key prerequisite for a quantum measurement of an _ arbitrary _ motional observable of a trapped ion as proposed by gardiner , cirac and zoller @xcite .",
    "these authors have generalized the 1-d synthesis of motional states to 2-d and higher dimensions . in spite of the conceptual elegance ,",
    "the method proposed by gardiner , cirac and zoller is difficult to implement in general .",
    "the problem is that the number of laser operations required for a preparation of a two - mode target state @xmath0 of the form |_target= _",
    "m=0^m_max_n=0^n_max q_mn|m , n . [ st1 ] depends _ exponentially _ on the dimensionality of the subspace of the fock space in which the target state is embedded .",
    "in particular , if @xmath1 then the number of necessary operations is proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "this exponential dependence restricts applicability of the proposed method ( see below ) . a novel approach which overcomes this obstacle was introduces very recently by kneer and law @xcite .",
    "the authors have considered a photon  number  dependent interaction which is induced by a detuned standing  wave laser field in @xmath3 direction .",
    "it keeps on resonance only transitions between fock states @xmath4 with a fixed number @xmath5 of trap quanta in @xmath3 direction while applying sequentially the 1-d preparation scheme @xcite in the @xmath6 direction for each particular @xmath5 .    in this paper",
    "we propose an alternative universal algorithm for a construction ( synthesis ) of an _ arbitrary _ quantum state of the two - mode bosonic field which can be straightforwardly generalized for the preparation of an arbitrary multi - mode system . in our algorithm",
    "the number of operations required for a preparation of the two - mode state ( [ st1 ] ) grows only polynomially as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath1 , then the number of operations is proportional to @xmath9 .    to make our discussion as close as possible to experimental realization we consider the preparation of the two - dimensional vibrational motion of a trapped ion @xcite .",
    "the choice of the system is motivated by the fact that dissipative effects can be significantly suppressed in ion traps which is important for a _ deterministic _ engineering of quantum states .",
    "moreover , the quantized vibration motion of a trapped ion can be effectively controlled by a proper sequence of laser pulses tuned either to the atomic electronic transition or to resolved vibrational sidebands @xcite .",
    "the simplest quantum state preparation is represented by a simple _ unitary _ evolution of an input state of the system governed by a specific ( generally , nonlinear ) hamiltonian .",
    "obviously , the fixed hamiltonian restricts the family of target states which can be `` generated '' from available inputs .",
    "another way how to prepare states of the system of interest ( e.g , single - mode bosonic field ) is to consider quantum interaction between this system and an adjoint quantum system ( e.g. fermions ) .",
    "dynamics of these two systems is governed by a specific interaction hamiltonian .",
    "the desired quantum state engineering is then achieved by _ conditional _",
    "measurements performed on the adjoint quantum system @xcite .",
    "this _ non - unitary _ selection of specific quantum trajectories allows to synthesize essentially all quantum states of the system under consideration .",
    "but there is prize to pay - the probability of the outcome of the given conditional process can be extremely small . to overcome this problem one may consider a sequence of interactions between the original and the adjoint systems .",
    "these interactions ( channels ) are governed by different hamiltonians with just one channel turned on at a given time .",
    "coupling constants in these hamiltonians and times of duration of given interactions are in this case _ free _ parameters which can be appropriately _ tuned _ so that at the output the system of interest is disentangled from the adjoint system ( see below ) and is prepared in the desired state .",
    "this approach has been recently utilized by law and eberly @xcite who have shown that by a suitable switching between two channels of the atom - field interaction one can generate an arbitrary state of the single - mode cavity field .",
    "it is important to note that quantum states of 1-d vibrational motion of trapped ions are experimentally created also via a sequence of laser pulses tuned either to an electronic transition or an appropriate vibrational sideband @xcite , that is , sequential switching of different interaction channels is used .",
    "generalizations of the 1-d vibrational quantum state synthesis to 2-d and more dimensions have been discussed recently @xcite . in what follows",
    "we introduce an _ universal _ scheme which enables deterministic preparation of an _ arbitrary _ two  mode target state via an appropriate switching between laser stimulated raman transitions described by single and two  mode interaction hamiltonians .",
    "the method can be generalized , e.g. , for a trapped ion in a 3-d trap potential and other multi - mode bosonic systems . even for higher dimensions",
    "the number of preparation operations scales polynomially with the dimensionality of the subspace of the fock space in which the target state is embedded .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce our algorithm for 2-d quantum  state synthesis . in section",
    "iii we discuss a physical realization of the preparation scheme . in section",
    "iv we examine the stability of our algorithm with respect to a technical noise .",
    "fidelity between outputs and specific target states is evaluated .",
    "we finish our paper with conclusions .",
    "without any loss of generality let us assume that we want to generate an arbitrary two  mode state given as a finite superposition of number ( fock ) states ( [ st1 ] ) . to describe the preparation algorithm we firstly split the whole hilbert space into an appropriate set of finite - dimensional subspaces labeled by a specific quantum number .",
    "then we introduce two sorts of interaction channels .",
    "the first set of hamiltonians will be responsible for dynamics within a given subspace ; while the second one will realize a `` transfer '' of probability amplitudes between different subspaces .",
    "in particular , let us consider vibrational states of a trapped ion , confined in 2-d harmonic potential .",
    "excitations of two vibrational modes are described by creation and annihilation operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath13 of all two  mode vibrational states can be divided to subspaces with constant total number of vibrational quanta , i.e. , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is spanned by two  mode fock states @xmath17 .",
    "the subspaces @xmath16 are dynamically independent ( invariant ) for those hamiltonians which do not change the total number of vibrational quanta @xmath18 .",
    "however , to realize controlled manipulations with states within a given subspace @xmath16 we need an interaction of the 2-d bosonic field with another quantum system . in the case of trapped ions",
    "it is natural to assume the coupling to internal energy levels of ions . in particular , we use three internal electronic states @xmath19 ( in @xmath20 or @xmath21 configurations ) with energies @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) which form the basis of the hilbert subspace @xmath24 . due to quantum interaction between the vibrational and internal degrees of freedom the total state vector of the composed system with the given maximum number of vibrational quanta @xmath25 at time @xmath26 reads    & = & _ j=0^j_max_k=0^j _ i = a , b , c q_k , j - k;i(t ) |k , j - k|i , [ st2 ] which reflects quantum - mechanical entanglement between the two subsystems .",

    "we have considered two cases when @xmath172 and @xmath173 ( here @xmath1 ) .",
    "2 clearly indicates the fact , that larger the value of @xmath8 more pronounced is the role of fluctuations ( compare solid and dashed lines which correspond to @xmath172 and @xmath173 , respectively ) .",
    "this observation is easy to explain : the total number of operations in our algorithm is proportional to @xmath174 ( for @xmath175 ) which means that the case @xmath173 requires almost three times more operations compared to the case with @xmath172 .",
    "the noise is accumulated as a function of elementary operations , therefore to improve the fidelity of the preparation process it is important to choose carefully @xmath8 . to be specific , for a given @xmath176 we have to choose the _ minimal _ values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 such that _ m=0^_n=0^|q_mn|^2 - _ m=0^m_max",
    "_ n=0^n_max |q_mn|^2 . [ fin ]",
    "we can also use fig .  2 to illustrate the fact that for a given value of @xmath8 the fidelity of the preparation may depend on the target state . to be specific ,",
    "we have found that smaller the number of nonzero amplitudes @xmath177 in the target state ( [ st1 ] ) the higher the fidelity is for a given value of the range of fluctuations @xmath178 . this behavior can be rather surprising as for synthesis of two states `` localized '' within the same region of the vibrational `` lattice '' @xmath39 we need comparable number of elementary operations .",
    "nevertheless , each nonzero @xmath177 after the synthesis is biased by more or less the same error and , consequently , the states with smaller number of nonzero amplitudes @xmath177 are less sensitive to fluctuations .",
    "as already stated , this observation concerns only states `` localized '' within the same region of the vibrational lattice @xmath39 and with a comparable mean number of vibrational quanta .",
    "finally , we briefly compare our algorithm with the one proposed by gardiner , cirac and zoller @xcite in which the number of operations in the preparation sequence is growing _ exponentially _ as @xmath179 .",
    "therefore fluctuations for @xmath8 large enough cause insurmountable problem .",
    "there is also another problem with this procedure .",
    "namely , gardiner , cirac , and zoller have utilized only two internal atomic levels ( @xmath27 , @xmath105 ) which results in the fact that their algorithm is based on manipulations with vibrational states which are out of the original hilbert space specified by the cutoffs @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , manipulations with highly excited vibrational states are required for construction of states with relatively small number of vibrational quanta .",
    "this means that not only the number of operations is exponentially growing but also the number of vibrational quanta during the preparation procedure may transiently exponentially increase .",
    "we stress that our algorithm is associated with manipulations only within the original subspace of the hilbert space specified by @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the number of operations grows only polynomially as @xmath174 .",
    "the dimension of the two  mode fock subspace from which the component states are does not increase during the preparation procedure .",
    "this great reduction of number of operations is due to the fact that we have employed the third atomic level @xmath106 in the preparation procedure . very recently",
    "a new 2-d preparation scheme was introduced by kneer and law @xcite .",
    "the standing  wave laser field in @xmath3 direction induces a photon - number dependent interaction enabling thus to use 1-d schemes selectively for particular subspaces with constant number of trap quanta in @xmath3 direction .",
    "the number of operations scales also polynomially as @xmath180 with only two electronic levels involved .",
    "in this paper we have presented a universal algorithm for an efficient deterministic preparation of an arbitrary two - mode bosonic state .",
    "we have adopted this algorithm as a computer program @xcite .",
    "the proposed method can be generalized to 3-d trapping potential and three  mode vibrational states . in this case",
    "one would need four internal electronic levels and nine interaction channels coupled to the 3-d vibrational field .",
    "it can be shown that the number of operations required for quantum state synthesis scales polynomially ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "further generalization to multi - mode fields is possible @xcite .",
