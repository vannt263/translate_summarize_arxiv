    "at present , a very interesting topic in the field of medium energy physics is devoted to the role of effective degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) in hadronic systems in terms of nucleon , meson and isobar d.o.f . and their connection to the underlying quark - gluon dynamics of qcd .",
    "for the study of this basic question , the two - nucleon system provides an important test laboratory , because it is the simplest system for the study of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , the role of medium effects due to two - body operators and the relevance of offshell effects , i.e.  the change of single particle properties in the nuclear medium .",
    "moreover , the deuteron is of specific relevance as an effective neutron target . within the present effective description ,",
    "one is able to obtain a reasonable , though not perfect description of the possible hadronic and electromagnetic reactions in the two - nucleon sector below @xmath1 threshold .",
    "however , for energies beyond @xmath1 threshold up to the @xmath0 region additional complications occur .",
    "present state - of - the - art models should incorporate not only a realistic nn interaction , but also a dynamical treatment of the @xmath0 isobar .",
    "moreover , in view of the requirement of unitarity , the various possible reactions should be described within one consistent framework , because they are linked by the optical theorem . in the past , we have started to realize this ambitious project within a _ retarded _ coupled channel @xmath2 approach , based on a three - body scattering approach with nucleon , @xmath0 and meson degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "for energies up to the @xmath0 region , our model hilbert space @xmath3}$ ] consists of three orthogonal subspaces @xmath3 } = { \\cal h}^{[2]}_{\\bar n } \\oplus { \\cal h}^{[2]}_{\\delta } \\oplus   { \\cal h}^{[2]}_{x}\\ , $ ] , where @xmath3}_{\\bar n}$ ] contains two ( bare ) nucleons , @xmath3}_{\\delta}$ ] one nucleon and one @xmath0 resonance , and @xmath3}_{x}$ ] two nucleons and one meson @xmath4 .",
    "concerning the hadronic part , the basic interactions in our model are @xmath5 and @xmath6 vertices . inserting these into the lippmann - schwinger equation , one obtains after some straightforward algebra @xcite effective hadronic interactions acting in @xmath3}_{\\bar n } \\oplus   { \\cal h}^{[2]}_{\\delta}$ ] which contain , apart from pion - nucleon loop contributions to the nucleonic self energy , _ retarded _ one - boson exchange ( obe ) mechanisms describing the transitions @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 . due to the nonhermiticity and nonlocality of a retarded operator , which becomes moreover complex above pion threshold , in most applications",
    "the simple static approximation is used by neglecting the energy transfer by the exchanged meson .",
    "the corresponding static operators are much easier to handle , but one encounters on the other hand at least two serious problems . above pion - threshold , unitarity is violated due to the absence of singularities in the static operators . moreover , in the past it turned out that even the simplest photonuclear reaction , namely deuteron photodisintegration , can not be described even qualitatively within a consistent static framework @xcite .    in our explicit realization ,",
    "we use for the retarded @xmath10 interaction the elster potential @xcite which takes into account in addition one - pion loop diagrams in order to fulfil unitarity above pion threshold .",
    "therefore , one has to distinguish between bare and physical nucleons ( see @xcite for details ) . concerning the transitions @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    ", we take besides retarded pion exchange static @xmath11 exchange into account .",
    "moreover , the interaction of two nucleons in the deuteron channel in the presence of a spectator pion ( the @xmath12 channel ) is also considered .",
    "this mechanism is necessarry for satisfying unitarity , because otherwise no asymptotic free @xmath12 state would exist . by a suitable box renormalization @xcite , we are able to obtain approximate phase equivalence between the elster potential and our coupled channel approach below pion threshold",
    ".    similarly , the basic electromagnetic interactions consist of baryonic and mesonic one - body currents as well as vertex and kroll - rudermann contributions @xcite .",
    "these currents are , together with the @xmath13 vertex , the basic building blocks of the corresponding effective current operators .",
    "the latter contain beside the ordinary spin- , convection- and spin - orbit currents full retarded pionic meson exchange currents and electromagnetic loop contributions , where the latter can be interpreted as off - shell contributions to the baryonic one - body current @xcite .",
    "moreover , static @xmath11 mec as well as @xmath0 mec contributions are taken into account .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that concerning the pionic part gauge invariance is fulfiled in leading order of @xmath14 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the hadronic pion - nucleon loop contributions , the retarded @xmath1-exchange contribution to the nn interaction , the electromagnetic loop contributions , and the @xmath1 mec are based on the same @xmath13 vertex .",
    "the hadronic @xmath0 parameters and the m1 @xmath15 coupling are simultaneously fitted to the @xmath16 multipole of pion photoproduction on the nucleon , to the @xmath17 channel of pion - nucleon scattering and to the @xmath18 channel of nucleon - nucleon scattering @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ nnphase ] , our results for the @xmath18 phase shift and inelasticity are depicted .",
    "we obtain a good description at least up to about @xmath19 mev .",
    "this is of particular relevance for deuteron photodisintegration where the most important contribution to the unpolarized cross section in the @xmath0 region comes from the @xmath18 channel .",
    "concerning the other partial @xmath10 waves , the overall description is only fairly well @xcite .",
    "therefore , we have started to construct from scratch an interaction model whose parameters are fitted to the phase shifts and inelasticities of _ all _ relevant @xmath10 partial waves for energies up to about 1 gev . however , as of yet we have not found a parameter set which would lead to a considerable improvement .",
    "one reason for this failure may be the fact that our effective baryon - baryon model is basically a one - boson exchange model which does not take into account more complicated mechanisms like the crossed two - pion - exchange .",
    "moroever , the @xmath20 interaction has to be improved .",
    "forthcoming studies on that topic are essential , especially for clarifying the role of final state interactions ( fsi ) in hadronic and electromagnetic breakup reactions on the deuteron for energies beyond the @xmath1 threshold .",
    "as next , we discuss very briefly deuteron photodisintegration .",
    "the starting point of our consideration is the static approach of wilhelm _ et al . _",
    "@xcite which is based on the bonn - obepr potential @xcite .",
    "similar to our present approach , there is no free parameter in the calculation of the photodisintegration process in @xcite . as is evident form fig .",
    "[ fig_gd ] , wilhelm _ et al .",
    "_ clearly fail in describing the data .",
    "one obtains a considerable underestimation of the cross section in the @xmath0 peak .",
    "moreover , a dip structure around @xmath21 occurs at higher energies which is not present in the data .",
    "this feature is also present in other static approaches like the unitary three - body model of tanabe and otha @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "these problems in the differential cross section vanish almost completely in a retarded approach @xcite",
    ". however , some discrepancies in polarization observables like the linear photon asymmetry @xmath22 or the polarization @xmath23 of the outgoing proton are still present @xcite .",
    "it is known that polarization observables may be sensitive to small reaction mechanisms which are suppressed in the unpolarized cross section .",
    "therefore , we assume that the failure of our model in describing @xmath22 and @xmath23 may be attributed to the present treatment of the hadronic interaction which needs to be improved as has been outlined above .    a very interesting topic is the exploration of the spin asymmetry of the total cross section of the nucleon and light nuclei which determines the gdh - sum rule @xcite @xmath24 and which is at present under investigation experimentally @xcite . in ( [ gdh ] )",
    ", @xmath25 denotes the total photoabsorption cross section on a target with mass @xmath26 , spin @xmath27 and anomalous magnetic moment @xmath28 with the photon spin parallel ( antiparallel ) to the target spin .    due to the lack of a free neutron target , a measurement of the gdh - sum rule on the deuteron is of specific significance because it has been suggested in the past that one can measure the spin asymmetry of the total photoabsorption cross section of the neutron by using light nuclei like the deuteron",
    "this would rest on the assumptions that ( i ) the polarized deuteron constitutes an effective polarized neutron target and ( ii ) one has to suppose that the spin asymmetry on the deuteron is dominated by the quasi free pion - production , so that binding and fsi effects from the presence of the spectator nucleon can be neglected , resulting in an incoherent sum of proton and neutron contributions .    however , both assumptions are questionable .",
    "first of all , due to the existence of the @xmath29 state component in the deuteron wave function , even in a completely polarized deuteron target , the neutron is not completely polarized . with respect to the second assumption",
    ", one has to recall that , in contrast to the nucleon case , for the gdh - integral on the _ deuteron _ also the energy region _ below _",
    "@xmath1 threshold has to be taken into account due to the existence of the breakup channel @xmath30 which is absent in the photoabsorption on a free nucleon .",
    "as has been pointed out in @xcite , there exists a strong anticorrelation between pion production and photodisintegration , because the latter reaction yields a very large _ negative _ contribution to the gdh - integral in ( [ gdh ] ) near the breakup threshold .",
    "this facts explains at least partially the large difference between the gdh - value on the deuteron ( @xmath31 @xmath32b ) and the sum of the gdh - value on proton and neutron yielding 438 @xmath32b .",
    "morover , the effect of final state interactions in @xmath1 production on the deuteron can not at all be neglected @xcite so that a simple spectator model picture is not appropriate for the evaluation of the spin asymmetry on the deuteron .    due to these facts",
    ", it is obvious that an extraction of the neutron amplitude from the deuteron reaction can not be performed in a model independent manner .",
    "nevertheless , the experimental investigation of the gdh - sum rule on the deuteron is very important because the measurement of the spin asymmetry is for itself of great interest since it will give us much more detailed information on the underlying dynamics than just the unpolarized cross section .",
    "therefore , it may serve in the future as a stringent test for existing models ( see for example fig .",
    "[ gdh_fig ] ) in the two - nucleon sector .",
    "in the future , we plan to apply the present model to other reactions , especially electrodisintegration .",
    "conceptually , we have to improve our hadronic interaction model",
    ". moreover , additional d.o.f . like the roper , the @xmath33 and the @xmath34 resonances should be taken into account if one wants to consider higher energies .",
