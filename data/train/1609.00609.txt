    "deep inelastic lepton scattering provide a good platform to study the internal structure of nucleon , such as what it is consists of and how its constituent distribute in momentum space ? in a simple quark model , nucleon is consist only of three quarks .",
    "this simple quark model has successfully explained a few of basic properties of nucleon  including its mass , spin and parity , etc .",
    "however , it is not enough for explaining the experimental data from deep inelastic lepton off nucleon . in order to solve this problem",
    ", feynman put forward a very successful model  parton model of nucleon@xcite , now we have known that the partons in nucleon including valence quarks , sea quarks and gluon , which is far more complicate than the simple quark model .",
    "the structure function , which contains the information of nucleon structure , can be easily presented by the parton s momentum distribution in a infinite momentum frame(imf ) @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the charge of the ith parton and @xmath3 the ith parton s momentum distribution function .",
    "now , the key question is how to compute the parton s momentum distribution function ?",
    "strict analysis of the momentum distribution of nucleon constituents should start from quantum chromodynamics(qcd ) . because the complication of qcd non - perturbation , it is very difficult to compute the distribution function from the first principle of qcd .",
    "considering the partons in nucleon may obey some determined statistical law , i shall make a attempt to calculate the distribution function from statistical physics in this paper , as i shall show in the following .",
    "in the imf , the interaction between the partons becomes `` slowly '' , and hence the partons in nucleon can be safely regarded as ideal gas and they should obey statistical laws .",
    "we suppose the valence quarks in nucleon obey boltzmann distribution . under equilibrium state ,",
    "boltzmann distribution gives the probability of finding a valence quark in the range of @xmath4 @xmath5 which is one valence quark s momentum distribution function and @xmath6 is determined by @xmath7 where@xmath8 is the ratio of total valence quarks s momentum to nucleon s momentum(@xmath9 ) .",
    "here , we have regarded up quark and down quark in nucleon as identical particle . because proton consists two up quarks and one down quark , we have @xmath10 for proton , here @xmath0 is bjorkon scaling(@xmath11 ) . in this paper",
    ", we shall use @xmath0 and @xmath12 exchangeable , for @xmath13 in imf .",
    "the deviation from the above relation is observed in experiment mainly because of the mass difference between up quark and down quark . from eqs.([ovqd ] ) and ( [ betae ] ) , we can see that the valence quark momentum distribution in nucleon is only determined by a free parameter@xmath8 .",
    "we draw the contribution from valence quarks @xmath14 in a free nucleon in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] for three different value of @xmath8 .",
    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]     in the range of @xmath15 $ ] , experimental data show an apparent rise as @xmath0 increases , our curve depart from them and monotonously go down , the reason is that we have neglected the effect of fermi motion of the nucleons . considering the influence of fermi motion , rozynek and wilk found that the trend of nucleonic structure function inside nucleus will change substantially in the high-@xmath0 direction@xcite .",
    "of course , nuclear environment is different for different nuclei , so the corresponding parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 will vary with nuclei .",
    "this change is small , and it leads to the shape of ratio r(x ) curve is a little bit different for different nuclei , but the total variation tendency is alike .",
    "in this paper , we use a statistic model to calculate the parton distribution in a free nucleon and in a confined nucleon(nuclear emc effect ) . though this model has not been able to explain the parton distribution over all @xmath0 , it fit the experimental data well in most range of @xmath0 at least reveal statistical law play an important role in the parton distribution of nucleon .",
    "considering other effects like nucleon fermi motion and possible surface effects of detailed nuclear structure , one may give a better description of nucleon parton distribution over more @xmath0 and more nuclei .",
    "all of the effort will be worth , for it help us to understand the internal physics of nucleon .",
