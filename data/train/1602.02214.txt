    "cavity optomechanics is based on the radiation pressure interaction between light and mechanical resonators at macroscopic scales @xcite .",

    "this method works very well and more than 50% squeezing of the mirror can be obtained @xcite .",
    "this requires efficient coupling and a highly squeezed broad band field and thus has its own limitations .",
    "a more direct way is to have a parametric amplifier placed inside the optomechanical cavity so that the squeezing of the cavity field is generated inside the cavity .",
    "these squeezed cavity photons can interact directly with the red - detuned pump laser to produce squeezing of the mechanical mode .",
    "this is the main theme of the present work .",
    "the degree of the mechanical squeezing will be limited by the squeezing produced by the pa .",
