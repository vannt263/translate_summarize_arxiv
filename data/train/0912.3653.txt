    "@xmath0 hydri is a g2-type subgiant star exhibiting solar like oscillations .",
    "it is often referred to as the future of the sun due to having parameters ( table 1 ) close to those of the sun , in addition to being at a later evolutionary stage than the sun .",
    "being rather evolved , @xmath0 hydri exhibits mixed modes in its observed spectrum .",
    "this makes the star particularly interesting for asteroseismic studies as mixed modes carry more information about the core than do the regular p - mode frequencies .",
    ".parameters of @xmath0 hydri as given in literature .",
    "the radius was derived from the interferometric angular diameter ( north et al .",
    "2007 ) and the revised hipparcos parallax ( van leeuwen 2007 ) .",
    "the mass was then derived from the mean density from asteroseismology . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     = 0 , triangles to the model frequencies with @xmath1=1 , and diamonds to the model frequencies with @xmath1=2 .",
    "dotted vertical lines indicate the value of the large frequency separation , @xmath2    the chelle diagrams include all the observed frequencies , while those having identified modes are connected by a solid line for clarity .",
    "the observed frequencies which are not connected by a line and shown with smaller symbols are the ones that are not assigned a mode by the observers ( bedding et al .",
    "2007 ) ; however , they note that those frequencies will include some genuine modes although some of them might be sidelobes or noise peaks .",
    "the size of the largest symbols cover approximately 1.5-@xmath3 uncertainty to both sides on the horizontal axis .",
    "three of the identified @xmath1=1 frequencies that fall to the left side of the @xmath1=1 ridge are identified as mixed modes by the observers ( bedding et al .",
    "the model without he settling or diffusion reproduces the observed frequencies very well except for the lowest mixed mode .",
    "it is seen from fig.1 that some of the unidentified observed frequencies also match the model frequencies quite well .",
    "when the diffusion and settling of helium is added , the agreement between the model and the observations is less strong than the previous case .",
    "although the lowest mixed mode is reproduced in this model , the mixed mode having the sharpest character ( largest departure from the @xmath1=1 ridge ) is not .",
    "the highest mixed mode has not been reproduced by any model frequency with @xmath1=1 , suggesting that @xmath1=3 frequencies might be investigated to search for a match to that frequency .",
    "the positions of both models on the subgiant branch are shown in fig .",
    "3 .        the model with diffusion is younger due to having completed the main sequence phase faster , as the hydrogen mass fraction decreases faster owing to diffusion and settling bringing helium to the core .",
    "furthermore , the hook shape in the evolutionary track with diffusion is due to the fact that the star had grown a convective core up to an extent where it contained almost 4% of the stellar mass .",
    "our results justify that the empirical power law representing the effect of near - surface layers in the sun works for @xmath0 hydri as well .",
    "our best models with and without he settling and diffusion reproduce the observed @xmath1=0 and @xmath1=2 modes well ; however , the fit at @xmath1=1 modes is relatively poor due to the mixed modes , but still satisfactory .",
    "it is important to investigate the possibility of any of the observed modes being an @xmath1=3 mode .",
    "furthermore , our results are in agreement with the findings of fernandes & monteiro ( 2003 ) , who derived , through the hr diagram analysis , the mass to be 1.10@xmath4 @xmath5 , the helium abundance to be between 0.25 and 0.30 , and the stellar age to be between 6.4 and 7.1 gyr .",
    "we , however , note that the age of our model with helium diffusion is less than the lower limit of the cited result . employing @xmath6",
    ", they found the mass to be 1.09@xmath70.22 @xmath5 , noting that the large uncertainty is to be improved with the improved accuracy of the observations .",
    "further analysis may be carried out to investigate the effect of convective core overshooting as our models had convective cores at some earlier stage in their evolution .",
    "gd would like to thank travis s. metcalfe for helpful discussions regarding the analysis .",
