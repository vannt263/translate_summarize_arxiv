    "black hole x - ray binaries spend the majority of their duty cycles in a low - luminosity ( @xmath3ergs@xmath0 ) , quiescent state . theoretical models to explain the low luminosities and the observed spectra either consider radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , reduce the inner accretion rate to zero @xcite , invoke winds or outflows @xcite , or some combination of these effects .",
    "more recently , jets have been demonstrated to represent a significant component of the power output of accreting black holes at low luminosities @xcite , making the coupling between inflow and outflow processes crucial to understanding the nature of low - luminosity accretion .",
    "simultaneous multi - wavelength observations @xcite have shown that the radio and x - ray luminosities ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ) of hard state black hole x - ray binaries are correlated via the non - linear relation @xmath6 , implying a fundamental coupling between the accretion and ejection processes in hard state systems , which was later demonstrated to extend unbroken into the quiescent state @xcite . with the inclusion of a mass term , the correlation was further extended to include supermassive black holes @xcite .",
    "however , the universality of this correlation has been called into question . from an observational perspective",
    ", a population of radio - faint x - ray binaries lying well below the correlation was discovered in the relatively bright hard x - ray state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although @xcite found evidence that this population may rejoin the correlation at low luminosities ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "more theoretical work also suggested that the correlation should break down below a fraction @xmath8 of the eddington luminosity @xmath9 , with the power law index steepening as the synchrotron x - ray emission from the jet begins to dominate the compton - upscattered emission from the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "although two of the most sub - eddington systems detected in the radio band , sgr a@xmath10 and a0620 - 00 , both appear to rule out this model , it is possible that the proposed threshold luminosity below which the correlation steepens is either significantly lower than proposed by @xcite , or that it is not the same for all sources .",
    "thus , the true nature of the coupling between inflow and outflow at the lowest luminosities has been difficult to confirm .",
    "the extremely low luminosity of the quiescent state of black hole x - ray binaries has rendered it inaccessible to radio observations for all but the closest and brightest systems , a0620 - 00 and v404 cyg , respectively .",
    "a0620 - 00 , at a distance of only @xmath11kpc @xcite , is currently the faintest radio - emitting black hole x - ray binary known , with a measured 8.5-ghz radio flux density of @xmath12@xmath1jy and a simultaneously - determined 210kev x - ray luminosity of only @xmath13ergs@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "v404 cyg , at the recently - measured parallax distance of @xmath14kpc @xcite has a relatively high quiescent luminosity of @xmath15ergs@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it is a persistent radio source with a flat radio spectrum @xcite and a flux density of @xmath16mjy , although occasional small flares have been detected in the quiescent state , in which the flux density increases by a factor of 3 on timescales of @xmath17min @xcite .",
    "the persistent radio emission is believed to arise from a steady , partially self - absorbed , compact jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the persistent , core - dominated nature of this emission makes black hole x - ray binaries ideal astrometric targets when in their hard or quiescent states .",
    "high - precision astrometric observations with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) would allow us to measure source proper motions , which can provide information about the formation mechanisms of the black holes ( e.g * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and in some cases , model - independent distances ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "prior to embarking on an astrometric campaign , we need to determine which hard state and quiescent systems are bright enough to be detected with the high sensitivity array ( hsa ) .    while several black hole x - ray binaries have been monitored during their decay to quiescence following an outburst ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in every case , the sources have faded below the detection threshold before reaching their stable quiescent luminosity . using the enhanced sensitivity of the new wideband receiver ( cabb ; the compact array broadband backend ) on the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , @xcite attempted to detect the two quiescent systems",

    "deeper radio observations are required to identify astrometric targets and to accurately determine the nature of the correlation between radio and x - ray emission in the quiescent state .    in this paper , we describe a deep radio survey of quiescent black hole x - ray binaries carried out by the very large array ( vla ) in order to identify possible targets for an astrometric observing campaign , assuming the existence of more radio - loud quiescent sources similar to a0620 - 00 , v404 cyg and sgr a@xmath10",
    ". we also report on higher - sensitivity follow - up observations of three targets using the wide bandwidths now available with the expanded very large array ( evla ; * ? ? ?",
    "in order to identify possible targets for an astrometric vlbi campaign , we observed eleven quiescent black hole x - ray binaries using the old vla system under program code am986 .",
    "the integration times were set to provide a robust detection of the minimum flux density for which an astrometric detection with the hsa would be possible , equating to @xmath18h of time on source with the vla .",
    "the schedules were submitted to the dynamic queue as a series of 1h blocks , such that between one and five epochs of observation were taken for each source .",

    "even if the underlying relationship between accretion luminosity and jet emission were indeed a single power - law , these changes would cause a slight deviation from the underlying power law in any empirical measurement of that relationship . equally , as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , synchrotron - dominated jet models predict a steepening of the relation below a critical x - ray luminosity @xcite , although such models do not seem to be applicable to either a0620 - 00 or sgr a@xmath10 .    in summary ,",

    "we would therefore expect radio flux densities of @xmath99@xmath1jy@xmath100 from the donor stars . while for astrometric purposes the source of the radio emission",

    "<S> we have conducted a deep radio survey of a sample of black hole x - ray binaries in the hard and quiescent states , to determine whether any systems were sufficiently bright for astrometric follow - up with high - sensitivity very long baseline interferometric ( vlbi ) arrays . </S>",
    "<S> the one hard - state system , swift j1753.5 - 0127 , was detected at a level of 0.5mjybeam@xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> none of the three sources were detected , to @xmath2 upper limits of 8.3 , 7.8 , and 14.2@xmath1jybeam@xmath0 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these observations represent the most stringent constraints to date on quiescent radio emission from black hole x - ray binaries . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainties in the source distances , quiescent x - ray luminosities at the times of the observations , and in the power - law index of the empirical correlation between radio and x - ray luminosities , make it impossible to determine whether these three sources are significantly less luminous in the radio band than expected . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is not clear whether that correlation holds all the way down to quiescence for all black hole x - ray binaries . </S>"
