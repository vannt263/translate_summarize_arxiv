    "the dynamical evolution of an external field perturbation around a black hole has been an object of great interest for physicists for the last few decades .",
    "one of the main reasons is that the frequencies of the quasinormal oscillations appeared in the dynamical evolution carry the characteristic information about the black hole , which could provide a way for astrophysicists to identify whether there exists black hole in our universe or not @xcite .",
    "the further studies indicate that the quasinormal spectrum could help us to understand more deeply about the quantum gravity @xcite and the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "moreover , the stability of a black hole can be examined by the study of the dynamical behaviors of the perturbations in the background spacetime @xcite .",
    "therefore , a lot of attention have been focused on the dynamical evolution of various perturbations in the various black holes spacetime .",
    "the simplest field in the quantum field theory is scalar field , which associated with spin-@xmath6 particles .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the scalar field in the different black hole spacetimes has been investigated extensively .",
    "it is found that for usual scalar field the late - time evolution after the quasinormal oscillations is dominated by the form @xmath7 for the massless field @xcite and by the oscillatory inverse power - law form @xmath8 for the massive one @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dynamical evolution of the scalar field has also been considered in the cosmology , which shows that the scalar field can be presented as the inflaton to drive the inflation of the early universe @xcite and as the dark energy to drive the accelerated expansion of the current universe @xcite .",
    "however , the above investigations are limited to the case where the action has a form @xmath9+s_m,\\label{act1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are corresponding to scalar field , ricci scalar and scalar potential , respectively . in this action",
    ", the coupling between the scalar field and the spacetime curvature contains only the term @xmath13 , which represents the coupling between the scalar field and the ricci scalar curvature .",
    "theoretically , the general form of the action with more couplings between the scalar field and the spacetime curvature can be expressed as @xmath14+s_m,\\label{act2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are arbitrary functions of the corresponding variables . obviously",
    ", the nonlinear functions @xmath15 and @xmath16 provide the more non - minimal couplings between the scalar field and the curvature of the background spacetime .",
    "these new couplings modify the usual klein - gordon equation so that the motion equation for the scalar field is no longer generally a second - order differential equation in this case , which yields the more complicated behavior of the scalar field in the background spacetime . by introducing the derivative coupling term @xmath17 ,",
    "amendola @xcite studied recently the dynamical evolution of the coupled scalar field in the cosmology and obtained some new analytical inflationary solutions .",
    "@xcite investigated a more general model with two coupling terms @xmath18 and @xmath17 , and found that the de sitter spacetime is an attractor solution in this case .",
    "recently , sushkov found @xcite that the equation of motion for the scalar field can be reduced to second - order differential equation when it is kinetically coupled to the einstein tensor .",
    "this means that the theory is a  good \" dynamical theory from the point of view of physics .",
    "moreover , sushkov @xcite also found that in cosmology the problem of graceful exit from inflation with the derivative coupling term @xmath19 has a natural solution without any fine - tuned potential .",
    "recently , gao @xcite investigated the cosmic evolution of a scalar field with the kinetic term coupling to more than one einstein tensors , and found that the scalar field behaves exactly as the pressureless matter if the kinetic term is coupled to one einstein tensor and acts nearly as a dynamic cosmological constant if it couples with more than one einstein tensors .",
    "the similar investigations have been considered in refs.@xcite .",
    "we studied the greybody factor and hawking radiation for a scalar field coupling to einstein s tensor in the background of reissner - nordstrm black hole spacetime and found that the presence of the coupling enhances both the absorption probability and hawking radiation of the black hole @xcite .",
    "these results may excite more efforts to be focused on the study of the scalar field coupled with tensors in the more general cases .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to investigate the dynamical evolution of the scalar perturbation coupling to the einstein tensor @xmath20 in the reissner - nordstrm black hole spacetime and see the effect of the coupling on the stability of the black hole .",
    "the plan of our paper is organized as follows : in the following section we will introduce the action of a scalar field coupling to einstein s tensor and derive its master equation in the reissner - nordstrm black hole spacetime . in sec.iii",
    ", we will study the effect of the coupling on the quasinormal modes in the weaker coupling , and then examine the stability of the black hole in the stronger coupling .",
    "finally , in the last section we will include our conclusions .",
    "in order to study the dynamical evolution of a scalar field coupling to einstein s tensor in a black hole spacetime , we must first obtain its wave equation in the background .",
    "the action of the scalar field coupling to the einstein s tensor @xmath20 in the curved spacetime has a form @xcite , @xmath21.\\label{acts}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coupling between einstein s tensor @xmath20 and the scalar field @xmath10 is represented by the term @xmath22 , where @xmath0 is coupling constant with dimensions of length - squared .",
    "varying the action ( [ acts ] ) with respect to @xmath10 , one can find the wave equation of a scalar field coupling to einstein s tensor can be expressed as @xcite @xmath23 = 0.\\label{we}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , the dynamical evolution of a scalar field depends on the the einstein s tensor @xmath20 and the coupling constant @xmath0 . since all the components of the tensor @xmath20 vanish in the schwarzschild black hole spacetime , we can not probe the effect of the coupling term on the dynamical behavior of the scalar perturbation . in the general relative theory ,",
    "the simplest black hole with the non - zero components of the tensor @xmath20 is reissner - nordstrm one , whose metric has a form @xmath24 with @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass and @xmath1 is the charge of the black hole .",
    "the einstein s tensor @xmath20 for the metric ( [ m1 ] ) has a form @xmath27 defining tortoise coordinate @xmath28 and separating @xmath29 , we can obtain the radial equation for the scalar perturbation coupling to einstein s tensor in the reissner - nordstrm black hole spacetime @xmath30r(r)=0,\\label{radial}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the effective potential @xmath31+\\frac{f^2}{r^2}\\frac{2\\eta q^2(3r^4+\\eta q^2)}{(r^4+\\eta q^2)^2}.\\label{ev}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , as the coupling constant @xmath32 the radial equation ( [ radial ] ) reduces to that of the scalar one without coupling to einstein s tensor . in the case @xmath33 , the coupling constant @xmath0 emerges in the effective potential , which means that coupling between the scalar perturbation and einstein s tensor will change the dynamical evolution of the scalar perturbation in the background spacetime .",

    "the peak height of the potential barrier increases for @xmath5 and decreases for other values of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , one can find that for the smaller @xmath0 the effective potential @xmath40 is positive definite everywhere outside the black hole event horizon .",
    "this implies that the solution of the wave equation ( [ we ] ) is bounded and the black hole is stable in this case .",
    "however , for the larger @xmath0 , we find that the effective potential @xmath40 has negative gap , and then the stability is not guaranteed . in the following section , we will check those values of @xmath0 for which the negative gap is present and study the stability of the black hole when the scalar perturbation is coupling to einstein s tensor .",
    "in this section , we first consider the quasinormal modes in the weaker coupling case in which the effective potential @xmath40 is positive definite and study the effects of the coupling on the quasinormal frequencies .",
