    "symbiotic stars are mass transfer binaries , containing a mass losing red giant and a mass accreting companion that is usually a white dwarf . one system is known with a neutron star @xcite , and systems containing main sequence stars are possible but have proved elusive to identify .",
    "mass transfer causes the symbiotics to exhibit highly complex light variations and spectra . from their characteristics at infrared wavelengths",
    "@xcite separate the symbiotics into two subclasses , d for dusty - type and s for stellar - type systems .",
    "ch  cyg is the brightest of the s - type symbiotic stars .",
    "the current series of papers is concerned with infrared spectroscopy of the late - type star in each symbiotic system . because velocities of this component are usually well behaved , we employ these spectra to derive single - lined spectroscopic orbits .",
    "the orbital elements provide insight into the period distribution , mass ratios , and orbital dynamics of these interacting systems .",
    "these results are ultimately of interest in evaluating the potential for catastrophic demise of the stellar components @xcite .",
    "ch cyg was the topic of our first paper on the infrared spectroscopy of symbiotic stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) . as a result of its brightness and placement in the northern sky , ch cyg is easily observed . following the publication of paper i",
    ", we continued to monitor ch cyg with various spectrographs and now have data spanning a period of nearly three decades . in the intervening 16 years since the publication of paper",
    "i our knowledge of m giant variables as well as the ch cyg system itself has greatly increased .",
    "we find , in agreement with many others who have worked on symbiotics ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , that ch cyg is the most complex of the symbiotics that we have observed .",
    "based on velocity variations of the m iii star in the ch cyg system , we concluded in paper i that the ch  cyg system is triple .",
    "two separate stable velocity variations , a long period variation of @xmath214.5 years and a short period variation of @xmath22.1 years , were found and are confirmed and refined in the present paper . in the discussion section of paper  i we proposed a model for this velocity behavior that placed the symbiotic binary in the 2.1 year orbit .",
    "our model , based on the short period mass function , had three underpinnings :    \\(1 ) the absence of any other known s - type symbiotic with a confirmed orbital period longer than five years and a mean period distribution for s - type symbiotic orbits of @xmath22 years @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) stellar pulsation theory showing that the two year velocity variation is too long to be the m giant fundamental pulsation @xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) weak evidence at that time that the system had a high inclination .",
    "because this triple - star model has been controversial and new information has accumulated , we decided to reexamine this conclusion . in the present paper we review all the evidence and show convincingly that the triple - star model with the white dwarf as a member of the short period system is _",
    "incorrect_. we now conclude instead that the system is a binary with the mass accreting white dwarf in the long period orbit .",
    "nonetheless , points ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) remain valid and are essential to an understanding of ch  cyg .",
    "while the ch  cyg symbiotic system has unique properties , we believe the most interesting aspect of ch  cyg is the nature of the 2.1 year variation . we show that ch  cyg qualifies as the most intensively investigated variable star with long secondary period ( lsp ) light and velocity variations .",
    "the existence and uncertain nature of the lsp variations is highlighted by @xcite .",
    "in 1992 we obtained two spectroscopic observations with the fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) at the coud focus of the kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) 4 m telescope @xcite .",
    "these observations are a continuation of the series of 71 fts spectra discussed in detail in paper i. the two observations were obtained in the 2  @xmath3 m region and have a resolving power of @xmath260,000 . shortly after the two new spectra were obtained , the fts was decommissioned as a result of budget cuts at kpno .    from 1995 through 2000",
    "we collected 25 observations with the coud feed telescope and spectrograph system at kpno .",
    "the detector was an infrared camera , nicmass , developed at the university of massachusetts .",
    "we obtained a 2 pixel resolving power of 44,000 at a wavelength of 1.623 @xmath3 m .",
    "a more extensive description of the experimental setup can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the nicmass equipment was sent to mt .",
    "stromlo observatory to continue the symbiotic orbit program in the southern hemisphere . that equipment along with the 1.85 m telescope was destroyed in a devastating bush fire that burned over mt .",
    "stromlo in january 2003 .    in 2000 three",
    "spectra were also acquired with the phoenix cryogenic echelle spectrograph at the f/15 cassegrain focus of either the kpno 2.1 or 4 m telescopes . a complete description of the spectrograph can be found in @xcite .",
    "the observations were centered at either 1.563 or 2.226 @xmath3 m and have resolving powers of either 50,000 or 70,000 .",
    "an expanded discussion of the experimental setup is in @xcite .",
    "phoenix was deployed to the southern hemisphere in 2000 .",
    "finally , five spectrograms were obtained in 2007 and 2008 with the kpno coud feed telescope , coud spectrograph , and a ccd with enhanced red sensitivity , designated lb1a .",
    "this 1980 x 800 pixel ccd was manufactured by lawrence berkeley national laboratory and is 300  @xmath3 m thick .",
    "although this thickness results in increased pixel contamination by cosmic - ray and background events , the chip was used because of its high quantum efficiency at far - red wavelengths .",
    "our spectrograms , centered near 1.005  @xmath3 m , have a wavelength range of 420    and a resolving power of @xmath221,500 .",
    "reduction and radial velocity measurement of the fts spectra are discussed in detail in paper i. for the nicmass and phoenix data standard observing and reduction techniques were used @xcite .",
    "wavelength calibration at the infrared wavelengths of 1.563 , 1.623 , and 2.226  @xmath3 m posed a challenge , because the spectral coverage was far too small to include a sufficient number of thar emission lines for a dispersion solution .",
    "thus , our approach was to utilize the absorption lines of a k  iii star .",
    "several sets of lines were tried , including co , fe  i , and ti  i. these groups all gave consistent results . for the spectrograms acquired with the lb1a ccd at 1.005 @xmath3 m",
    ", we were able to use thar spectra for wavelength calibration .",
    "telluric lines are present in the 1.005 and 2.226 @xmath3 m wavelength regions . these lines were removed from our observations by ratioing the spectra to a hot star spectrum observed on the same night .    for all of our spectra except those obtained with the fts , the absorption line radial velocities of ch  cyg were measured with the iraf cross - correlation program fxcor @xcite .",
    "those velocities were determined relative to the m - giant international astronomical union velocity standards @xmath4  oph or @xmath5  cet , which have radial velocities of @xmath619.1 and @xmath625.3 km  s@xmath7 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the standards were observed multiple times during the course of each night . for the fts spectra , which cover a wavelength range that is @xmath2100 times greater than the other spectra , velocities were referenced to telluric lines .",
    "our 106 kpno observations , which span nearly 30 years , are listed in table  1 , and the velocities are plotted in figure  1 versus heliocentric julian date .",
    "that plot clearly shows two periodicities .",
    "thus , we have employed the general least squares program of @xcite to obtain a simultaneous orbital solution for the short- and long - period velocity variations of ch  cyg .",
    "all kpno velocities were given unit weight after a comparison of the fts velocities with those from the phoenix and coud feed spectrographs showed that the rms values of the velocity data sets were nearly identical .",
    "we then computed several different orbital solutions .",
    "the first used only the kpno velocities , while , similar to a solution of paper i , the second included the velocities of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite plus our kpno velocities and is designated the all - velocity solution .",
    "weights adopted for the non - kpno velocities are the same as those assigned in paper i. as was done in that paper , we have also computed orbital solutions with the short period eccentricity fixed at 0.0 .",
    "however , given the systematic residuals that result from adopting such a sinusoidal fit and our discussion and conclusion about whether this short period velocity variation results from orbital motion or pulsation , we do not discuss the @xmath8 = 0.0 solutions any further .",
    "a comparison of the two remaining solutions shows that the long period of the kpno - only solution is nearly 40 days longer than that of the all - velocity solution , but that difference is only 0.7% and is less than the period uncertainty .",
    "uncertainties of the orbital parameters in the all - velocity solution are somewhat smaller than those in the kpno - only solution , as would be expected because of the longer baseline of data , but the parameter values of both solutions are within those uncertainties .",
    "thus , in table  2 we have chosen to adopt the more homogeneous solution that includes only our kpno velocities .",
    "for the individual observations table  1 lists the heliocentric julian date , the observed total velocity , and the observed minus calculated velocity residual ( @xmath9 ) to the combined orbit . also computed and listed in the table",
    "are the long period orbital phase , the long period velocity , which is equal to the total velocity minus the computed short period velocity , the short period orbital phase , and finally , the short period velocity , which is equal to the total velocity minus the computed long period velocity .",
    "figure  2 presents the computed velocity curve of the long period orbit compared with the kpno radial velocities , where zero phase is a time of periastron .",
    "each plotted velocity consists of the total observed velocity minus its calculated short period velocity .",
    "figure  3 shows the computed velocity curve of the short period orbit compared with the kpno radial velocities , where zero phase is a time of periastron .",
    "each plotted velocity consists of the total observed velocity minus its calculated long period velocity .",
    "the radial velocity residuals , listed in column 3 of table 1 ( @xmath10 ) , were analyzed for possible additional periods .",
    "the program periodogram ( pgram ) was employed to fit sinusoids to the phased data for periods between 50 and 500 days in steps of 0.05 days . this period finding program works well even for non - sinusoidal curves with eccentricities as large as @xmath20.4 .",
    "various subsets of data were searched in an attempt to remove false periods . two possible periods of @xmath262 and @xmath2170 days appear in the velocity residuals .",
    "however , the velocity semiamplitudes are very small , at maximum 0.4 km s@xmath7 . of particular interest",
    ", we find no period above the noise in the 90 - 110 day period range , which corresponds to a photometric period of ch cyg .",
    "@xcite first proposed an orbit for the m giant . despite the use of very heterogeneous data with large uncertainties",
    ", they determined a probable period of 5750 days , very close to our value of 5689 days .",
    "although their semiamplitude and eccentricity are rather different from ours , other elements are similar .",
    "we also compare our orbital solution to those in paper  i. in that earlier analysis the long period for the all - velocity solution was 5298 days , while that for the kpno velocities alone was 5483 days .",
    "thus , the improved period of our adopted solution ( table  2 ) is nearly 400 days longer than the all - velocity solution in paper  i and about 200 days longer than the kpno - only solution given in that paper .",
    "comparing other elements of our adopted solution and the kpno - only solution of paper  i , the orbital elements are similar , but the uncertainties of the long period elements have been significantly reduced .",
    "the ephemeris for conjunctions with the m giant in front of the white dwarf , which corresponds to times of mid - eclipse , is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an integer number of cycles .",
    "the above ephemeris for the eclipse of the white dwarf by the m giant predicts mid - eclipse dates of hjd 2,440,664 for 1 cycle earlier and hjd 2,452,042 for 1 cycle later .",
    "the uncertainty of these predictions is about 240 days .",
    "paper i presented a broad introduction to ch  cyg , but much material has been published subsequent to that time . to understand the nature of the ch cyg system , we first undertake an extensive review of the literature to determine basic parameters : variability , distance , luminosity , radius , rotation , mass , mass loss , and orbital inclination .",
    "this results in a revised picture of the system .",
    "the photometric variability of ch cyg was reviewed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the mass accreting component in the ch  cyg system contributes to the flux especially at blue wavelengths . during periods of strong activity",
    ", the m giant variability can be cloaked even in the optical with light generated by the accretion process . however , during quiescent periods , the m giant can be detected into the blue .",
    "ch cyg had an extended period of quiescence from 1885  1963 . during this interval",
    "ch cyg was known only as a late - type semiregular variable star .",
    "a review of historic material on the variability of ch cyg by @xcite , obtained during the period of quiescence , finds that the dominant period in the m giant is @xmath2100 days . during periods of symbiotic activity",
    "the 100 day period can be hard to detect @xcite .",
    "the visual amplitude of the 100 day period is small , @xmath20.1 magnitude @xcite .",
    "the exact period depends on the dates sampled .",
    "@xcite gave the dominant period as 94 and 99@xmath02 days while @xcite found 102@xmath03 days .",
    "@xcite concluded that the @xmath2100 day period is systematically increasing at a rate of @xmath25 days per century and suggested , following the work of @xcite , that the ch cyg m giant is currently undergoing a helium - shell flash . @xcite and",
    "@xcite both noted that the @xmath2100 day period implies that the ch  cyg giant is a first overtone pulsator .",
    "in addition to the 100 day period , a period of @xmath2770 days is also frequently reported .",
    "@xcite provided a detailed analysis of the 770 day photometric period in ch  cyg .",
    "the photometric properties of the 770 day variation show increasing amplitude toward shorter wavelengths but not in a way consistent with dust extinction .",
    "in addition , the energy distribution in the ir suggests changing spectral type ( and temperature ) during the light cycle , but there are no spectral type changes in the blue .",
    "while @xcite failed to detect this period , @xcite noted the presence of a @xmath2750 day period with amplitude of nearly 1 mag in @xmath13 photometry .",
    "the @xmath2750 day period is apparent in data illustrated in @xcite .",
    "the symbiotic was quiescent at the time of these observations .",
    "there also is a suggestion of the @xmath2100 day period in this data , but the spacing of the data is too coarse for the period to be adequately sampled .",
    "the simultaneous presence of both periods in ch  cyg was reported by @xcite .",
    "she listed ch  cyg as one of a family of pulsators with a lsp and estimated a typical long to short period ratio of @xmath29 for these objects .",
    "a longer list of lsp semiregular variables appears in @xcite .",
    "@xcite asserted that the lsp stars listed in @xcite and @xcite are those with the largest amplitude secondary periods .",
    "the @xcite catalog contains only @xmath21.5% of the then known long period variables .",
    "more recently , the fraction of local long period variables with long secondary periods is reported by @xcite and @xcite as @xmath225 - 30% .",
    "in paper i we noted the close agreement between the 770 day photometric period and the 750 day spectroscopic period and assumed both originate from the same physical mechanism .",
    "we make the same assumption in this paper .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite detected lsp variations spectroscopically in a number of semiregular variables .",
    "the semiregular 100 day pulsation was not detected spectroscopically . scaling from typical ratios of velocity to photometric amplitude for srb variables @xcite",
    ", the ch cyg 0.1 magnitude visual amplitude implies a @xmath20.5 km s@xmath7 velocity amplitude .",
    "this is near the detection limit for our observations (  3 ) .",
    "when the accretion disk in the ch cyg system is active , light from the disk dominates the blue and violet portions of the spectrum . at such times",
    "the optical light curve is highly complex . @xcite",
    "present a summary of recent optical photometry . because ch  cyg has a complex light curve , evidence for eclipses depends critically on collaborating evidence rather than just sudden decreases in the @xmath14 band light .",
    "the first claim of an eclipse of the hot component by the red giant , occurring from 1985 may to october , was reported by @xcite .",
    "this was largely based on timing , matching a @xmath14 band event to one more than 15 years earlier .",
    "however , these decreases in light show considerable structure because of activity in the system .",
    "the dates of mid - eclipse are jd 2440585 and jd 2446270 with the eclipse fwhm @xmath2200 days .",
    "the ingress is brief , perhaps 10 days .",
    "@xcite reported an ephemeris of jd@xmath15 = 2,446,275(@xmath075 ) + 5700(@xmath075)e .",
    "subsequent to the claim of @xcite considerable evidence has been published that supports the claim that the 1985 @xmath14 band decrease is an eclipse .",
    "@xcite summarized a list of five changes in the ch cyg system that were observed during the 1985 eclipse .",
    "these are ( 1 ) the disappearance of rapid optical flickering , ( 2 ) the dominance of the m giant continuum in optical spectra at mid - eclipse , ( 3 ) the transition of double peaked balmer emission lines to weak broad single peaked emission lines at mid - eclipse , ( 4 ) the dominance of the red side of the double peaked emission in h@xmath5 and h@xmath16 before mid - eclipse and the dominance of the blue emission following mid - eclipse , and ( 5 ) the prominence of the nebular lines [ ne iii ] 3869   and [ o iii ] 5007  .",
    "items ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) show that the accretor was eclipsed .",
    "items ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) identify the eclipsed object as a rotating disk . item ( 5 ) shows that the blue  ultraviolet flux level was depressed during the eclipse so that nebular lines became visible .    apparent confirming proof of eclipses in ch cyg comes from the prediction and then observation of the eclipse of 1999 @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented @xmath17 photometry for the 1999 eclipse , revealing that the eclipse is not visible at @xmath13 , but is clearly detectable in @xmath18 and much more pronounced in @xmath14 .",
    "this is the expected enhancement of an eclipse of a hot object by a cool star .",
    "in addition , they find that flickering is again absent during the 1999 eclipse , just as in 1985 .",
    "the strengths of various accretion related spectral lines decreased during the eclipse . from figure  5 of @xcite the mid - date of the eclipse in 1999",
    "is estimated as jd 2,451,425 .",
    "a major complication to this recent eclipse identification is that the 1999 eclipse date , jd 2,451,425 , is 550 days earlier than predicted by the ephemeris of @xcite and 617 days earlier than our ephemeris .",
    "these differences correspond to an orbital phase shift of @xmath20.1 . in eclipses of symbiotic stars",
    "the observed eclipse is not that of the white dwarf , which is unobservable at visual wavelengths , but rather of a uv bright , hot spot .",
    "three dimensional simulations of the symbiotic - recurrent nova rs oph by @xcite predict an accretion disk that has a diameter 0.1 times the major axis of the binary system .",
    "this accretion disk is surrounded by a much larger archimedean spiral , so there is a large area over which the hot spot can occur . from observations of several symbiotics",
    "@xcite concluded that during quiescent phases of the systems , the times of eclipses occur prior to the time of inferior conjunction of the giant .",
    "when the systems are active eclipses coincide with conjunctions predicted by spectroscopic orbits . for ch",
    "cyg the @xcite ephemeris from active periods agrees with the times of inferior conjunction given in equation 1 .",
    "the 1999 eclipse took place during the period of declining activity preceding the current extended period of quiescence @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the accretion disk was undergoing changes at the time of the 1999 eclipse .",
    "the details of the light curve shape and hydrogen line profiles in these eclipses add further support to the eclipse interpretation . in all cases",
    "the @xmath14 light is brighter before the eclipse than after . in cataclysmic systems",
    "this is a well - known eclipse hallmark .",
    "the pre - eclipse brightening results from the accreting side of the disk facing the mass donating star and rotating in the direction of orbital motion . for h@xmath5 and h@xmath16 line profiles , observed through eclipse @xcite , the negative side of the profile is eclipsed first and reappears first .",
    "thus the accretion disk is rotating with the side moving away from the red giant on the leading side of the orbit .",
    "the eclipses discussed above are associated with the 15.6 yr orbit .",
    "yet another complication in the discussion of ch  cyg eclipses is that @xcite , @xcite , and subsequent papers by skopal claim that there are also eclipses in the 2.1 yr orbit .",
    "@xcite reported the presence of @xmath14-band decreases spaced at @xmath22.1 year intervals on the light curve .",
    "supporting evidence is seen in the disappearance of flickering during at least some of these events .",
    "counter to the 2.1 yr eclipse claim @xcite and @xcite found a general correlation of the strength of the flickering with the luminosity of the blue - violet continuum .",
    "@xcite suggested that the events observed by @xcite are not eclipses but result from collapses of the inner accretion disk .",
    "flickering is an indicator of a compact mass - accreting object in the system .",
    "@xcite found that the rapid optical variations ( flickering ) of ch cyg have a period of @xmath2500  s. there is a range in the periods reported for optical flickering in ch cyg , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite suggested a period in the range @xmath2 2200  3000 s ( for a detailed discussion see * ? ? ?",
    "with any of these time scales the flickering must originate at a hot component in the ch cyg system since the dynamical time scale for the giant , t@xmath19@xmath2@xmath20 , is on the order of a month . flickering is also seen in x - ray observations , confirming the white dwarf nature of the secondary @xcite .",
    "ch cyg is known to have both radio @xcite and optical @xcite jets , which are approximately in the plane of the sky .",
    "this provides a first limit on the inclination of the orbit , although the information from the eclipses is far more accurate .",
    "@xcite found from a time series of observations that the jet is precessing with a period @xmath218 @xmath0 0.5 yr . while the precession mechanism is uncertain , the period of the precession is similar to the 15.6 yr orbit , suggesting that the white dwarf is in that orbit .",
    "@xcite discussed the relation between the inner disk and the development of jets .",
    "they argued that it is impossible to understand the jet and optical activity of ch cyg without an accretion disk around a white dwarf companion .",
    "@xcite pointed out a strong correlation between optical flickering in ch cyg and changes in flux .",
    "the decrease or disappearance of flickering corresponds to a decrease in the blue flux .",
    "they found that this is related to disruption of the inner disk and follows episodes of jet production .",
    "@xcite undertook a detailed photometric calibration of symbiotic spectral types . from the resulting type of m6.5 ( @xmath0 0.3 ) iii for ch cyg , @xcite used a spectroscopic parallax to derive a distance of 240 @xmath21 pc .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the 268@xmath066 pc distance based on hipparcos observations @xcite , which has been used extensively in the literature since 1997 .",
    "recently , @xcite reanalyzed the hipparcos parallaxes resulting in a distance for ch cyg that is nearly 10 percent closer , 244 @xmath22 pc , than the @xcite distance .",
    "the uncertainties for the original and revised hipparcos distances have large overlap .",
    "@xcite provided a fit to optical and infrared photometry of ch cyg , using a kurucz model spectrum for an m6 iii star and a dust model .",
    "they found a luminosity of 6900 l@xmath1 .",
    "this is in good agreement with the value given by @xcite from an energy distribution encompassing the uv through the far - ir .",
    "he determined a bolometric luminosity of @xmath28000 @xmath0 4000 l@xmath1 for a distance of 268 @xmath0 66 pc .",
    "this luminosity corresponds to a radius of @xmath2310 r@xmath1 .",

    "thus , it is not surprising that the 2.1 year period in ch cyg has not been extensively investigated as a possible lsp .",

    "@xcite also dismissed rotation as a cause since the rotational velocity required is @xmath48 13 km s@xmath7 and would produce noticeable line broadening . in  4.3 the ch cyg line width was shown to be slightly more than half this value .",
    "@xcite hypothesized that the 2.1 yr period might be the result of spots related to cyclic changes in convective cells .",
    "this origin for lsp behavior was ruled out by @xcite .",

    "3 ) is not sinusoidal .",
    "this provides one of the most powerful arguments against the 2.1 yr binary hypothesis .",
    "in fact , the eccentricity of 0.33 is moderately large .",
    "polar views of the 15.6 yr and 2.1 yr orbits are shown in fig .",
    "@xcite provides formulae for computing the time scale for tidal synchronization . because the low mass companion does not have sufficient mass to spin up the envelope of the m giant ,",
    "the synchronization time scale is the merger time scale , @xmath21000 years @xcite .",
    "the time scale for orbital circularization is longer than the time scale for synchronized rotation .",
    "merger in the synchronization time scale makes this argument mainly academic .",
    "however , the circularization time scale is also short , @xmath25000 years , so all contact binary orbits of this type would be expected to be circular .",
    "as noted by @xcite , there are many known lsp systems , so eccentric orbits , even if possible for one object , could not possibly be the case for the entire class .",
    "@xcite suggested that mass lost by the red giant in a binary system with a low mass star follows a spiral pattern producing the lsp variations .",
    "such spiral mass loss could then affect the symbiotic binary system .",
    "however , as discussed in  4.5 infrared observations of ch cyg require a dust temperature which places the dust well outside the the 15.6 yr long period orbit .",
    "furthermore , @xcite find that the 770 day variation in ch cyg , while color dependent , is inconsistent with reddening .",
    "these arguments provide convincing evidence that the 2.1 yr period variation of ch cyg does _ not _ result from binary motion .",
    "for the entire lsp group @xcite used arguments based on a multivariate test of the amplitude - luminosity relation to conclude that the lsp phenomenon is in general not a result of contact binaries .      while it has been shown",
    "theoretically that radial pulsation can not be a cause of the lsps , this is still frequently listed among the possible causes . in the case of ch cyg",
    "several authors have suggested that the 770 day period is the result of radial pulsation of the m giant ( see * ? ? ?",
    "we emphasize that a period of 770 days can not possibly be a radial pulsation .",
    "the frequencies of radial pulsations in agb stars can be calculated as a function of bolometric magnitude @xcite .",
    "the fundamental period as a function of absolute @xmath23 magnitude is plotted on fig .",
    "4 . at the luminosity of ch  cyg , @xmath23 = @xmath67.5 mag ,",
    "the radial fundamental period is @xmath2250 days .",
    "if the origin of the lsp is pulsational , the pulsations must be non - radial in nature .",
    "spectroscopic studies of lsps have been carried out by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "there are two remarkable qualities of the lsp velocities .",
    "first , the radial velocity variations among lsp stars are nearly identical .",
    "the velocity phase curves for seven lsp stars from @xcite and @xcite are shown in fig .",
    "the position of these objects on the period - luminosity relation is shown in fig .",
    "although the original orbit for one of these stars , af  cyg , had @xmath8 = 0.08 @xmath0 0.20 , given the large uncertainty , we have recomputed the orbit with @xmath8 = 0.3 as shown in fig .",
    "6 and found a very acceptable fit to the velocities , although the computed velocity curve is in antiphase with those of the other stars .",
    "the 2.1 yr velocity phase curve of ch cyg matches those of the other lsp stars .",
    "the remarkable similarity of the `` orbits '' is inconsistent with both the expectation of random orbital orientation as well as the circularization constraints discussed above .",
    "the variables included in fig .",
    "6 are large visual amplitude lsp systems , so the similarity of velocity amplitudes could be a selection effect .",
    "second , the lsp velocity variations totally dominate the shorter pulsation period in the lsp objects studied . for instance , in ch cyg the overtone pulsations are not detectable in the velocities (  3 ) and result in only a low amplitude photometric variation (  4.1 ) .",
    "thus , lsp velocity changes are not easily differentiated from orbital motion for stars where the photometric variation is poorly known",
    ". this could be pervasive among suspected binary systems .",
    "a possible example is the velocity curve of the x - ray , suspected neutron star symbiotic binary hd 154791 @xcite , which matches the parameters of the lsp `` orbits '' of the stars in fig .",
    "6 .    as noted by @xcite , velocity curves with the shape shown in fig .",
    "6 can be reproduced by rotating prolate spheroids .",
    "the symmetry of such a spheroid requires a rotation period twice the period of the velocity curve .",
    "this period is in agreement with 8 km s@xmath7 measured line widths in ch cyg .",
    "@xcite proposed a rotating pulsating ellipsoid model for the unusual light curves of two semiregular variables .",
    "a rotating prolate spheroid could result from a recent binary merger , but it is difficult to understand how an entire class of variables following a period - luminosity law could be the result of recent mergers .",
    "the observed properties of a rotating prolate spheroid can be generated by low order non - radial pulsation . in the case of non - radial pulsation",
    "a period - luminosity relation would exist .",
    "non - radial pulsation can be prograde , i.e. in the direction of stellar rotation , or retrograde .",
    "@xcite stated that waves traveling in retrograde , as opposed to prograde , result in identical velocity curves but with the sign reversed .",
    "this could explain the antiphase velocity curve of af  cyg in fig .",
    "@xcite provides models for some low l sectoral ( l = @xmath6 m ) modes .",
    "unfortunately , the models are only for m = 2 , 4 , and 6 . for these modes",
    "there are at minimum 4 sectors around the star and the velocity variations are nearly sinusoidal .",
    "the velocity amplitude decreases with increasing m because for higher m there are a larger number of velocity zones with cancelling sign @xcite .",
    "the amplitude and asymmetry of ch  cyg suggest an l = 1 mode . from the relations given by @xcite the l = 1 mode pulsation velocity amplitude is about half of the observed velocity amplitude .",
    "an interesting aspect of non - radial modes is that the vertical scale height is small .",
    "additional insight into the lsp problem comes from k to early m _ red _ giants . for these stars @xcite reported the presence of short period , i.e.  time scales of a few days to weeks , radial and non - radial pulsations . @xcite",
    "found non - radial pulsations restricted to the hot side of the coronal dividing line at about k2 . for an early k giant the radial periods are typically days .",
    "the k giants have secondary periods with lengths of hundreds of days .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty about the origin of the lsps for these stars , as for the m giant lsps .",
    "as is the case for agb lsps , rotation with star spots , non - radial pulsations , and low mass companions have been discussed as explanations . in the case of the k0 iii star",
    "@xmath59 her , @xcite found the pressure scale height for the photosphere to be a factor of 10 smaller than the radial wavelength of the 613 day pulsations .",
    "the hypothesis of non - radial modes in late - type giants has been impeded by the knowledge that gravity modes are evanescent in convective regions .",
    "this makes their postulated existence in both agb and red giants difficult to understand .",
    "thus , @xcite suggested r - mode oscillations @xcite , which arise in rotating , convective fluids , as an alternative .",
    "however , this alternative raises a different problem for agb stars . in agb",
    "stars the rotational period results in a pulsation period which is too long . for r - modes the pulsation frequency is equal to the rotation frequency for l = 1 and longer for higher modes @xcite . in the case of ch",
    "cyg the rotation period is more than twice the 2.1 year pulsation period .",
    "a solution proposed by @xcite relies on the point that lsp non - radial modes occur only in stars that also have radial pulsation .",
    "the proposal is that radial pulsation thickens the radiative layer above the convective layer allowing the propagation of g - modes .",
    "@xcite discussed light and color variations in lsp stars .",
    "these can be compared with the variations in ch cyg (  4.1 ) and predictions from stellar pulsation .",
    "the reported changes in spectral type are consistent with pulsation related changes in temperature .",
    "the types of variation reported by @xcite are fully consistent with variations for other lsp stars and with variations expected from stellar pulsation @xcite .    a complication in understanding the ch cyg system has been the report of short period eclipses by @xcite .",
    "@xcite concluded that for lsp stars the strength of h@xmath5 is a function of phase .",
    "they interpreted this as changing chromospheric activity . at some phases",
    "the chromosphere is absent , while at other phases it covers up to 70% of the stellar surface .",
    "this same phenomenon has been reported for the k giant lsp stars . for @xmath5",
    "boo the strength of he  i 10830   is correlated with the lsp @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the uv changes in ch cyg correlated with the short period phase found by @xcite and @xcite are pulsation driven changes in the chromosphere . from the dates of the deep uv minima given in @xcite the 2.1 yr orbital phase ( from the eccentric orbit ) is 0.14 , which is conjunction in an orbital model or a time of null velocity movement in a pulsational model .",
    "the absence of flickering during at least some of these events could be unrelated changes of structure in the white dwarf accretion disk @xcite .    in paper",
    "i the change of line shape with short period phase was discussed .",
    "the spectral lines have the largest fwhm at @xmath60 = 0.40.6 . however , the lines are more narrow and symmetric at phase 0.4 becoming more asymmetric at phase 0.8 . for k giants @xcite has noted the change in bisector shape with phase and mode in non - linear pulsations . the resolution and signal - to - noise ratio of the current ch cyg spectra does not allow detailed comparison but indicates that further study would be of interest .",
    "a long standing question for ch cyg is why this star was an m giant spectral type standard for the first half of the 20th century and then became an active symbiotic star . at the heart of this question",
    "is the the nature of the accretion onto the white dwarf secondary .",
    "a possibly naive expectation is that the lsp variation is a controlling factor in the m giant mass loss .",
    "we speculate that in the case of a non - radial pulsation origin for lsp , the non - radial modes are stable but variations in the dominant mode can occur .",
    "if the dominant mode controls other stellar properties , for instance the mass loss rate or the directionality of the mass loss , the mass transfer in a symbiotic system would change .",
    "observational tests employing samples of lsp variables should be possible .",
    "the near - infrared radial velocities of ch  cyg conclusively show that the m giant in the system exhibits two different velocity variations , a 15.6 year `` long '' period and a 2.1 year `` short '' period .",
    "we have reviewed the literature on the basic parameters for the ch  cyg giant and have estimated its mass and radius .",
    "evolutionary arguments require an m giant mass near 2 @xmath49 .",
    "x - ray observations require a white dwarf companion more massive than 0.44 m@xmath1 .",
    "various lines of evidence but most compellingly observations of eclipses demand that the inclination of the 15.6 year orbit is nearly edge on .",
    "the long period mass function is then matched by the assumption of a 0.7 m@xmath1 white dwarf .",
    "the ch cyg symbiotic system is an unusual one .",
    "the separation between the giant and white dwarf is about four times larger than that for typical s - type systems .",
    "ch  cyg is a first overtone pulsating agb star , which will drive symbiotic mass transfer at a larger radius .",
    "while ch cyg is classified as an s - type system , there are a number of similarities with d - type mira systems . changing activity in the ch",
    "cyg symbiotic system is possibly related to variations in the short - period activity .",
    "the observed 2.1 yr velocity variation is indistinguishable from that seen in stars with long secondary periods ( lsp ) .",
    "lsp objects occupy a track on the period - luminosity diagram , identified by @xcite as sequence d. the cause of the lsp variations , while discussed exhaustively , remains uncertain .",
    "lsp is the only theoretically unexplained type of stellar variability @xcite . in the case of ch cyg there",
    "seem to be only two viable options to produce the 2.1 yr period",
    ". the star could be a rotating prolate spheroid , perhaps as the result of a common envelope phase with a former low - mass companion .",
    "however , with this model it is hard to understand why there are so many lsp stars . much more likely , ch cyg is undergoing low order non - radial pulsations that mimic the observed properties of a rotating prolate shape . if these are g - modes , the outer stellar structure of pulsating m giants does not follow standard models because an outer radiative layer is required to propagate the g - modes . while this structure change is not required for r - modes , the periods of r - modes are excessively long .",
    "this research has been supported in part by nasa grant ncc5 - 511 and nsf grant hrd-9706268 to tennessee state university .",
