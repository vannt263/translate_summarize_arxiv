    "the microwave irradiation of two - dimensional electron systems @xmath12 has remarkable consequences on the transport properties at low magnetic fields .",
    "recently , two experimental groups @xcite , reported the unexpected discovery of zero resistance states ( zrs ) when high mobility @xmath11 heterostructures in weak magnetic fields were exposed to millimeter irradiation . unlike the strong magnetic field regime",
    ", the hall resistance is not quantized .",
    "the magnetoresistance exhibits giant oscillations , periodic in @xmath0 with @xmath1 the radiation frequency and @xmath2 the cyclotron frequency ; the series of minima formed at @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite , or @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "these discoveries triggered a large number of experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies . according to reference @xcite , zrs",
    "probably originate from negative resistance states ( nrs ) ; it was argued that negative resistance induces the formation of current domains , yielding an instability that drives the system into a zrs .",
    "the existence of nrs was first predicted in the pioneering work of ryzhii @xcite .",
    "nowadays two distinct mechanisms that produce negative longitudinal conductance are known : @xmath17 _ the impurity scattering mechanism _ , which is caused by the disorder",
    "assisted absorption and emission of microwaves @xcite , and @xmath18 _ the distribution function mechanism _ , according to which the microwave absorption modifies the electron distribution function leading to a negative longitudinal conductance @xcite . a model for the impurity scattering mechanism",
    "was proposed previously by the authors @xcite , the model is based on the fact that the microwave and landau dynamics can be exactly taken into account producing well defined floquet - landau states .",
    "the disorder effects are treated perturbatively , inducing transitions between the floquet - landau levels .",
    "the model reproduce various of the experimentally observed features , in particular the fact that negative resistance states @xmath19 appear only when the electron mobility exceeds a threshold .",
    "although the experiments described above do not include the effect of periodical potential modulations , exploring its physical consequences is worthwhile .",
    "we can identified at least three reasons for doing so : @xmath17 the study of both weak @xcite and strong @xcite periodically modulated 2des in the presence of magnetic fields has lead to the discovery of interesting transport effects , such as commensurability phenomena and transport anisotropies . @xmath18",
    "the theoretical method previously developed in references @xcite is well suited to study this kind of system .",
    "@xmath20 the use of artificially fabricated arrays of periodic scatterers at the interface of ultraclean @xmath11 heterostructures @xcite may allow to test the predictions made by these theoretical studies .    in this work",
    "we make a theoretical study of the microwave photoconductivity of a 2des in the presence of a magnetic field and a two - dimensional modulation .",
    "two theoretical studies of modulated 2des under the combined effects of magnetic and microwave radiation have recently appeared .",
    "dietel @xmath21 @xcite considered the photoconductivity in the case of 1d periodic modulation .",
    "the calculation uses first order perturbation theory for both the microwave field as well as for the periodic potential . additionally , the calculation is restricted by the following conditions : the lattice parameter @xmath8 is small as compared to the cyclotron radius @xmath22 , the temperature @xmath23 is large with respect to the periodic strength potential @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . due of the unidirectional structure of the modulation the photocurrents parallel and perpendicular to the modulation are different .",
    "the work of gumbs @xcite applies for a strong 2d modulation , but is linear with respect to the microwave field intensity .",
    "his approach made use of the usual kubo formula in which the matrix elements are evaluated using the numerically obtained hofstadter - type wave functions . in this paper",
    "we address the case of a 2d modulation under different conditions ; in particular we explore the possible appearance of negative resistance states .",
    "the landau and microwave field contributions are exactly taken into account .",
    "we analyze the regime in which the following conditions hold : @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . instead of appealing to the usual kubo formula",
    ", our approach shows that the use of the floquet - landau states determines not only the wave functions required to evaluate the matrix elements ; but also leads to a modified kubo - like formula , in which the oscillations on the density of states induce the development of negative resistance states . as a first step we find a unitary transformation that exactly takes into account the dynamics associated with the landau and radiation contributions . as a second step",
    ", the periodic potential is added perturbatively . with respect to the landau - floquet states , the periodic potential act as a coherent oscillating field which induces transitions between these levels .",
    "based on this formalism , we provide a kubo - like expression for the conductance that incorporates the oscillatory floquet structure of the system .",
    "it is found that both @xmath28 and @xmath29 exhibit strong oscillations determined by @xmath0 .",
    "nrs develop for sufficiently high electron mobility and strong microwave power .",
    "the model is used to test chirality effects induced by the magnetic field , calculations are carried out for various @xmath30-field polarization s . finally , we explore the nonlinear regime in which multiple photon exchange play an essential role , as well as the current - voltage characteristics of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present the model and the method that allow us to obtain the exact solution of the landau - microwave system , as well as the perturbative corrections induced by the periodic potential . in section [ kubo ]",
    "we develop the formulation of the linear response theory valid in arbitrary magnetic and microwave fields .",

    "the effect is included using the solution to the classical equations of motion with both ac- and dc - electric fields , eq . ( [ soleqm ] ) .",
    "a possible connection between the observed @xmath257 in @xmath11 heterostructures @xcite and the the predicted nrs@xcite was put forward by andreev @xmath258 @xcite , noting that a general analysis of maxwell equations shows that @xmath259 induces an instability that drives the system into a zrs .",
    "this mechanism requires the longitudinal current @xmath260 as a function of @xmath261 to have a single minimum , the system instability will evolve to the value @xmath261 in which @xmath260 cancel .",
    "returning to the irradiated superlattice case , in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] it is observed that in general the @xmath260 @xmath262 @xmath261 plot has an oscillatory behavior , with more than one minima .",
    "hence the conditions of the andreeev mechanism do not apply .",
    "consequently , negative conductance states may be probably observed in 2-dimensional superlattices , when exposed to both magnetic and microwave fields .",
    "we have considered a model to describe the microwave photoconductivity of a 2des in the presence of a magnetic field , and a 2d periodic modulation .",
    "we presented a thoroughly discussion of the method that takes into account the landau and microwave contributions in a non - perturbative exact way , the periodic potential effects are treated perturbatively .",
    "the formalism exploits the symmetries of the problem : the exact solution of the landau - microwave dynamics ( [ tran1 ] ) is obtained in terms of the electric - magnetic generators ( [ trancan ] ) as well as the solutions to the classical equations of motion ( [ lagrang ] ) .",
    "the spectrum and floquet modes are explicitly worked out ( [ enerflo ] ) . in our model ,",
    "the landau - floquet states act coherently with respect to the oscillating field of the superlattice potential , that in turn induces transitions between these levels .",
    "based on this formalism , a kubo - like formula is provided ( [ condlw ] ) that consistently takes into account the oscillatory floquet structure of the problem .    it is found that both @xmath28 and @xmath29 exhibit strong oscillations governed by @xmath0 .",
    "the oscillations follow a pattern with minima centered at @xmath3 , and maxima centered at @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath263 and @xmath7 is the dominant multipole contribution .",
    "nrs develop for sufficiently strong microwave power ( fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) , in a narrow window of values of the lattice parameter @xmath264 ( fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) , and for high electron mobility samples ( fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) .",
    "the explanation for the nrs can be traced down to eqs .",
    "( [ condlw ] ) and ( [ derspec ] ) ; the longitudinal photoconductivity contains a new contribution proportional to the derivative of the density of states : @xmath242 . due to the oscillatory structure of the density of states",
    "this extra contribution takes both positive and negative values .",
    "this term is proportional to the electron mobility , hence for sufficiently high mobility the new contribution dominates leading to negative conductivity states . unlike the semiclassical origin of magnetoresistance oscillations observed in an antidot array for commensurate values of the ratio @xmath265 @xcite , these conductance oscillations have a quantum origin and would only appear in a narrow window of values of @xmath8 , around @xmath266 .    in conclusion , it is proposed that the combined effect of : periodic modulation , perpendicular magnetic field , plus microwave irradiation of 2des give rise to interesting oscillatory conductance phenomena , with the possible development of ncs and nrs .",
    "one should stress that according to our results , the production of nrs requires ultra - clean samples with electron mobilities of order @xmath238 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ) .",
    "the electron mobilities in the fabricated arrays of periodic scatterers so far @xcite are @xmath267 , consequently an increase on the electron mobilities of these kind of experimental setups by an order of magnitude would be required in order to observe the phenomena described in this work .      in section ( [ kubo ] )",
    "it was explained in detail the method to obtain the final expression for the modulation - microwave induced conductance eq .",
    "( [ condlw ] ) .",
    "working along a similar procedure the expression for the remaining conductivities are worked from equations ( [ condd ] ) and ( [ condw ] ) .",
    "first we quote the longitudinal dark conductance @xmath268 whereas the hall conductance reads -2.0 cm @xmath269   \\ , p\\ , \\frac{1}{\\left({\\cal e }   - { \\cal e } _ \\mu + \\omega_c \\right)^2 }   \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath161 indicates the principal - value integral . the final result for the mm assisted longitudinal conductivity",

    "furthermore , due to the @xmath278-electric field ( [ vecpot ] ) , the l.h . s. of the previous equation is estimated to be of order @xmath279 ; hence , in a first approximation the elastic scattering contribution can also be neglected .",
    "the resulting vlasov equation has the exact solution @xmath280 , where the velocity @xmath281 solves exactly the same classical equations of motion that follow from ( [ lagrang ] ) , and the initial condition is selected as , @xmath282 as the external electric field is switched - off . in particular it is verified that @xmath283 coincides with the floquet energy shift produced by the microwave radiation ( [ enerflo ] ) .",
    "the steady - state distribution , evaluated at the landau energy @xmath284 , is obtained by averaging @xmath285 over the oscillatory period @xmath286 in general it is verified that @xmath287 , thus expanding to first order one finds @xmath288 .",
    "hence , it is verified that a rapid relaxation of the fermi distribution to the quasi - energy states is a reasonable assumption .",
    "the arguments presented in this appendix have been introduced by mikhailov @xcite in order to explore the possibility that the microwave radiation leads to a population inversion ; however , it is concluded that it would require a rather high microwave intensity @xmath289 .",
