    "since the pioneering work by mott and twose  @xcite it is well known that all states in one dimension ( 1d ) are localized in the presence of uncorrelated disorder ,  @xcite which means that a quasi - particle wave function has a finite amplitude within a finite space interval and vanishes outside .",
    "the size of this interval ( localization length ) increases with the decrease of disorder .",

    "the one - exciton states that are closer to the bottom of the exciton energy band couple better to the light and hence determine the linear optical response .",
    "for this reason the energy ( and wave function ) statistics of the lower states has been attracting great deal of attention . in ref .",
    "the heuristic concept of the hidden low - energy structure of a 1d localized exciton was put forward .",
    "this concept was partly supported by the numerical simulations .",
    "@xcite however , it has not been proved directly by detailed statistical study .",
    "the basic idea of the hidden low - energy structure concept is as follows .",
    "the lower energy one - exciton eigenfunctions obtained for a fixed realization of disorder can be grouped in sets of two ( or sometimes more ) states which are localized at the same segment of the linear chain .",
    "these segments are almost non - overlapping .",
    "the typical length of a segment @xmath0 depends on the degree of disorder ( the quantity @xmath1 is often called the number of coherently bound molecules  @xcite ) .",
    "the energies of the states belonging to the same set are well separated , so that they form a local discrete energy structure .",
    "the mean energy of such local manifolds is distributed within the energy interval of the same order as the typical energy spacing between the levels of a local manifold . for this reason the local energy structure appears to be hidden ; it does not manifest itself neither in the density of states nor in the linear absorption spectra .",
    "nevertheless , it can be revealed from the optical response involving two - exciton transitions .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we primarily focus on the direct proof of the heuristic ideas put forward in refs .  . to do this we study in detail the low - energy levels statistics for a weakly localized 1d frenkel exciton .",
    "the bulk of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "the model hamiltonian is described . in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] the numerical results of the low - energy level statistics simulation are discussed .",
    "section  [ sum ] summarizes the paper and comments on the importance of the local discrete energy structure for optical response from the disordered frenkel exciton systems .",
    "we consider @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) optically active two - level molecules forming a regular 1d lattice with unity spacing .",
    "the corresponding frenkel exciton hamiltonian reads :  @xcite @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the state vector of the excited molecule with the energy @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the energy is assumed to be the gaussian uncorrelated ( for different sites ) stochastic variable with zero mean and the standard deviation @xmath8 . on the contrary ,",

    "the quantity @xmath13 will be referred to as the degree of disorder .",
    "hereafter , we assume @xmath12 to be negative , which corresponds to the case of the j - aggregates .",
    "@xcite in this case the states coupled to the light are those at the bottom of the exciton band ( see , for instance , ref .  ) .    as it was pointed out in ref .",

    "they can be found as the solutions of the following eigenvalue problem :    [ 1 ] @xmath15 @xmath16    where @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the eigenfunction and eigenenergy of the one - exciton state @xmath20  respectively ; the quantity @xmath21 , where @xmath22 $ ] , plays the role of the exciton wavenumber .",

    ": @xmath28 where @xmath29 . the corresponding expression in the nn approximation ( the term with @xmath30 in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ ek ] ) ) reads : @xmath31    straightforward comparison of the two equations shows that the long - range dd terms affect the exciton low - energy spectrum considerably .",
    "first , the exciton band bottom is red - shifted in the dd model with respect to the nn case : from @xmath32 to approximately @xmath33 .",
    "second , the @xmath34-dependence of the energy is stronger in the dd case due to the logarithmic factor in  ( [ bottomlr ] ) . in particular",
    ", the energy difference between the two lowest exciton states ( with @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) is greater when the long - range terms are considered .    as well as the eigenfunctions @xmath18 ,",
    "the oscillator strengths are almost the same in both models . for the transitions from the ground to lower exciton states",
    "they can be written as ( see , for instance , ref .  )",
    "@xmath37 here the dipole momentum of the optical transition is taken to be unity .",
    "thus , the oscillator strength of the transition from the ground state to the lowest exciton state ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 is proportional to the number of sites in the chain @xmath2 and carries 81% of the total oscillator strength ( which is equal to @xmath2 ) .",
    "in this section statistical properties of the one - exciton low - energy eigenfunctions and eigenenergies of the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) are analyzed numerically .",
    "we focus on the distributions of the localization segment length and energy spacings between lower states .",

    "figure  [ fig1 ] presents an example showing the nine lowest eigenfunctions @xmath44 ( these are real in our case ) and the corresponding eigenenergies @xmath41 . this set of wave functions was obtained for 250 sites chain in the nn model for the disorder degree @xmath40 .",
    "each plot also displays the corresponding oscillator strength @xmath45    several typical features of the lower eigenstates can clearly be seen from fig .",
    "first , all eigenfunctions are well localized at different segments of the chain .",
    "the lengths of these segments @xmath46 are smaller than the total chain length @xmath2 .",
    "some of the eigenfunctions are localized at the same segment ( _ e .",
    "g. _ manifold of states 4 , 6 and 9 ) and weakly overlap with the other states .",
    "second , one of the states of each particular ( local ) manifold has no nodes within its localization segment and hence have high oscillator strength ( _ e .",
    "g. _ state 4 ) while the other wave functions from the manifold ( _ e .",
    "g. _ states 6 and 9 ) have nodes within the segment and low oscillator strengths .",
    "this allows to classify such states as local ground and local excited states respectively .",
    "these states are similar to the states of a regular non - disordered chain ( see eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) at @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) . finally , it is important to note that a local ground state can have higher energy than a local excited state which is localized at a different segment .",
    "for example , the local ground state @xmath49 has higher energy ( @xmath50 ) than the local excited states @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this raises the question about the correlations between the local ground and excited states from one manifold , on the one hand , and between the states from different manifolds , on the other hand .",
    "it is clear from these arguments that grouping the states together into local manifolds is a principal problem ; correct criteria are needed to select the states which are localized at the chain segments .",
    "when such grouping is done the statistical analysis we are interested in becomes simple .      to select the states which are localized at the same segment first we need to find the local ground states .",
    "such states @xmath44 satisfy the inequality : @xmath55 for the constant @xmath56 we use the value @xmath57 , seeking , in other words , for the states which contain at least 95% of the wave function density in the main peak .",
    "the states @xmath58 and @xmath49 in the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] meet this criterion and can be considered as the local ground states",
    ".    then we find all local excited states . in order to do this",
    "we proceed as follows : for each local ground state @xmath59 ( @xmath60 in our example ) we seek for the states @xmath61 which are localized at the same segment as the state @xmath59 .",
    "these ( local excited ) states should simultaneously meet two criteria .",
    "the first is similar to the criterion given by eq .",
    "( [ gs_criterion ] ) : @xmath62 where @xmath63 runs over all sites of the chain .",
    "the value for the cut - off constant @xmath64 will be discussed later .",
    "the second criterion is to be applied to the fourier transforms @xmath65 corresponding to the wave functions @xmath44 : @xmath66 the later is necessary to drop rapidly oscillating states @xmath67 , envelope functions of which are localized within the same segment as the considered ground state @xmath59 .",
    "the energy of such states is in the vicinity of the exciton band maximum .",
    "their spatial extension is of the same order of magnitude as the localization length of the low - energy states , so these high - energy states often meet the criterion ( [ es_criterion1 ] ) .",
    "the reasonable values for the cut - off parameters @xmath64 and @xmath68 can be estimated by considering the states of a rectangular quantum well . in the limiting case of an infinitely deep quantum well",
    "the overlap integral for the ground state ( given by eq .",
    "( [ phi ] ) at @xmath47 ) and the module of the first excited state ( eq .  ( [ phi ] ) at @xmath69 ) is equal to @xmath70 . in the more general case of a finite rectangular",
    "well the value of this integral depends on the well depth and width .",
    "it varies from about @xmath71 ( for a very deep excited state ) to zero .",
    "small values of the integral occur for very extended excited states that are just appeared in the well .    consider the well for which the probability to find the particle in the well equals @xmath72 for the ground state , then for the first excited state this probability equals about @xmath73 .",
    "the overlap integral of the type ( [ es_criterion1 ] ) for these states is about @xmath74 .",
    "this value gives an estimate for the parameter @xmath64 .",
    "the overlap integral of the moduli of the fourier transforms of these states is about @xmath75 , which gives an estimate for the @xmath68 .",
    "for our estimations we considered the limiting case of a rectangular well potential which varies infinitely rapidly at the well boundaries . in a smoother potential",
    "the values of the overlap integrals can be smaller . to account for this we use more relaxed cut - off criteria with @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "it is also worth noting that straightforward calculations revealed only weak quantitative dependence of the final results on the values of the cut - off parameters ( see appendix ) .    applying the criteria ( [ es_criterion1 ] ) and ( [ es_criterion2 ] ) to our sample set of eigenfunctions we find the following pairs of the local ground and first excited states : @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this finding looks reasonable ( see fig  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the states @xmath80 and @xmath81 also meet the above criteria . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the state @xmath81 has two well defined nodes within the segment of localization of the local ground state @xmath80 .",
    "it therefore can be referred to as the second local excited state",
    ". however , the second and higher local excited states will not be the subject of the present study .",
    "such higher excited states are usually localized at more extended segments and can not be associated with a particular local ground state .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] clearly shows that the spatial extension of a local ground state ( its localization length @xmath46 ) fluctuates from one state to another .",
    "different quantities can be used to characterize the extension of a wave function : ( i ) the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) , defined as @xmath82 , ( ii ) the mean - square displacement @xmath83^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath84 , ( iii ) the inverse of the lyapunov exponent @xmath85 and others .",
    "@xcite although these quantities yield slightly different localization lengths , they are of the order of the number of sites over which the wave function is extended .    for the local ground state , an alternative quantity can be used as the measure of its extension . according to eq .",
    "( [ fk1 ] ) , the oscillator strength of the ground state of the ideal linear chain is about the same as the chain length . in other words , @xmath43 also carries information about the extension of the corresponding local ground state wavefunction @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , the oscillator strength can be measured experimentally , e.g. it can be determined from the exciton spontaneous decay kinetics  @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason we use the oscillator strength as the measure of localization of the local ground states .",
    "the number of sites in the chain @xmath2 should be much larger than the typical oscillator strength @xmath87",

    "( see also ref .  ) and was based on the following arguments : an exciton localized at a segment of size @xmath1 feels a reduced ( exchange - narrowed ) disorder @xmath100 ;  @xcite this reduced disorder degree must be of the same order of magnitude as the energy separation between the two lowest local exciton levels , @xmath101 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath102 is smaller than @xmath103 the two levels would be strongly mixed by disorder and the corresponding exciton wave functions would tend to reduce their extension . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath102 exceeds @xmath103 then the disorder is perturbative and the wave functions would tend to increase their extension .",
    "thus , the equality @xmath104 gives the self - consistent relationship between the spatial extension of the exciton wave functions and the disorder degree which the localized exciton feels .",
    "this relationship provides an estimate for the localization length @xmath1 : @xmath105 this theoretical scaling law is in good agreement with the scaling law of @xmath87 obtained numerically , the latter being smaller by the factor of about @xmath106 .",
