    "independent studies and observations of both small and large scale structure are presently challenging the otherwise widely embraced cdm model . the so - called missing satellites problem ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where observations of galaxies do not map the abundance of substructures that are produced in cdm cosmologies is a serious drawback of the model .",
    "furthermore , at smaller scales , the density profiles of galaxies show large cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that have not been reproduced by the simulations .",
    "the failure to replicate in cdm simulations pure bulgeless galaxies which are observed in an important fraction @xcite adds to the problem .    while several recipes have been proposed in the attempt of ameliorating these issues ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , most of them introducing baryonic physics processes , current studies conclude that even including repeated baryonic outflows , large cored galaxies are not found in the simulations @xcite , although this is still highly debated in the literature .",
    "the aforementioned situations , where the cdm model proves deficient in explaining the observations , are demanding further investigation .",
    "the wdm models , with sterile neutrinos leading as most probable particle candidates have been well studied and discussed in the literature in the past thirty years with an increased interest in the last few years ( see the highlights of daniel chalonge workshops and colloquiums 2011 - 2013 for latest developments in the wdm field @xcite ) .    it has been shown recently @xcite that modeling the quantum pressure of fermionic particles @xcite on the other hand",
    ", one can reproduce the expected cores in dwarf galaxies , known to be dark matter dominated .    moreover , the recent detection @xcite of a 3.55kev unidentified emission line both on the data from xmm spectrum of galaxy clusters and chandra can be a hint of sterile neutrino decay .",
    "since particles in warm dark matter models have different intrinsic properties from the cold dark matter particle candidates , the effect of these particle on structure formation and evolution is expected to be qualitatively different on both large and small scales .    notwithstanding the difficulties in modeling properly the neutrino particle , several attempts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have been conducted with a successful outcome in solving some of the cases where cdm comes to an impasse .",
    "while the methods of cdm simulations have been accurately improved over the last decade , the wdm simulations encounter a number of difficulties in accurately describing the effect of such particles on both large and small scales .",
    "in addition to the resolution limitations that are met in the cdm case as well , wdm particles like neutrinos , for example , have a phase space density limit , a fermi - dirac distribution and a thermal velocity dispersion .",
    "referring merely to sterile neutrinos , these particles decouple whilst relativistic .",
    "the effects of the initial velocities of the warm dark matter particle are expected to manifest themselves on small scale structure formation .",
    "the free streaming exponentially dampens the power spectrum of density fluctuations such that very few structures are formed below the damping scale .",
    "conservation of the fine grained phase space density is expected to set a maximum density that can not be exceeded during the formation of structures with collisionless particles . for a fermionic wdm particle",
    ", we can crudely define the coarse - grained phase - space density @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the density and @xmath2 is the velocity dispersion .",
    "this definition is only a good approximation for locally isotropic velocities where the density of particles is not strongly varying .",
    "different numerical approaches have been used to address the impact of warm dark matter particles thermal velocities .",
    "since the numerical resolution is strongly limited with respect to the physics , one knows that the phase space distribution sampling is anyway poor in space as well as in velocity space . the best compromise is to imprint the physical particle velocity to the simulation particle , as common practice in galactic dynamics .",
    "the particle limited sampling is not a sufficient reason to entirely drop the velocity sampling by neglecting the thermal velocities as done in some previous works , while keeping nonetheless the power spectrum cutoff implied by a non - zero thermal velocity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "is the fact that for some dark matter particles the thermal velocities are comparable or smaller than the bulk zeldovich velocities .",
    "even though it has been considered difficult to prescribe accurately initial thermal velocities in dark matter simulations , the importance of using them has been emphasized in previous studies like @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in the absence of a tested universal mechanism of production for the warm dark matter particle ,",
    "the relation between the particle mass and its corresponding thermal velocity is strongly dependent on the specific model adopted .",
    "the widely used formula for generating velocities @xcite which sets such a relation is based on an assumption that overestimates the number of species at decoupling and in effect underestimates the value of thermal velocities .",
    "we will take the opportunity to discuss these assumptions and we will also provide a method for estimating thermal velocities for fermionic , maxwellian and bosonic particles in both relativistic and non - relativistic regimes based on a different set of premises that takes quantum physics into consideration .",
    "several analyses of warm dark matter simulations in the kev range conclude that the formation of structure is hierarchical , like in cold dark matter simulations .",
    "traditionally , top - down structure formation means forming chronologically the biggest structures first and the smaller ones later , while bottom - up or hierarchical structure formation means the reverse scale order , making it difficult to describe a scenario in which both coexist .",
    "in fact it is well known since , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite that typical structure formation proceeds in time first along pancakes , then filaments and then halos , mixing the large and small spatial scales at all times with different proportions .",
    "if we use this terminology in a broader sense , top - down describes the dominant long range effects on structure formation : sheets collapsing into filaments , collapsing into halos .",
    "bottom - up hierarchical structure formation , on the other hand , describes dominant short scale effects , mergers of both early formed and later formed halos .",
    "we will examine how both of these mechanisms of structure formation show up in the warm dark matter simulations presented here .",
    "additional constraints coming from peculiar features may be considered . in cold dark matter models , during the hierarchical evolution caustics are being wrapped inside earlier generations of the merging history , making them invisible in some cases even at high resolutions .",
    "however , @xcite show using cold dark matter simulations that accretion mechanisms of stars and dark matter clumps and disruption of the latter can produce concentering shells that resemble those observed in ngc 7600 . in the warm dark matter simulations , as we will see , the shells and caustics are more visible , especially at high redshift , where the top - down formation occurs .    constraints on the mass of a warm dark matter particle from lyman-@xmath3 forest , cosmic weak lensing , gamma - ray bursts , etc .",
    "( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) give a lower limit in the few kev range .",
    "to study the effects of warm dark matter on structure formation , we have , however , explored a larger mass interval , focusing on the region where these effects are more prominent while fairly balanced by the resolution .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in section 2 we explain the theoretical reasons for using the thermal component of velocities in the simulations .",
    "subsection 2.2.1 shows how the common used formula for generating velocities in warm dark matter simulations @xcite is conjectured from hypothetical assumptions .",
    "section 2.2.2 presents a different approach in estimating thermal velocities from the particle mass . in section 2.3",
    "we discuss some of the inconsistencies found in previous studies .",
    "section 3 describes the parameters used in our simulations while section 4 shows the results found from analyzing the simulations . at last",
    ", we present our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "the initial conditions of most cdm and wdm cosmological simulations have often initial thermal velocity taken as strictly zero , with the argument that at the finite initial redshift the thermal velocity of cdm particles is small in regard of the bulk flow following from zeldovich s prescription .",
    "we argue below that this practice is numerically inconsistent with the actual problem of describing a collisionless fluid of finite phase space density @xmath4 . for structure formation ,",
    "the distribution of the dark matter particles in velocity space is most important , as stressed by @xcite .    indeed , integrating newton s equation of motion for a set of particles in a force field",
    "@xmath5 is equivalent to solving in a lagrangian way with discrete mass particles the collisionless boltzmann equation with the characteristics method . in conventional notations",
    "the eulerian description of the phase space volume conservation reads , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the force field .",
    "the mass density @xmath1 is the projection of the phase space density on velocity space : @xmath8    the mass density @xmath9 generates the force field @xmath5 by newton s gravity . in a cosmological setup the mean density @xmath10 is subtracted , @xmath11                { { { \\mathbf x}}-{{\\mathbf x } } ' \\over |{{\\mathbf x}}-{{\\mathbf x}}'|^3 } \\cr        & = &              g \\int d^3x'\\,d^3v\\ , \\left[f({{\\mathbf x}}',{{\\mathbf v}},t)-{\\bar f}_0({{\\mathbf v}},t)\\right ]                { { { \\mathbf x}}-{{\\mathbf x } } ' \\over |{{\\mathbf x}}-{{\\mathbf x}}'|^3 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so in this context using vanishing small thermal velocity already poses a consistency problem since @xmath4 is of the form @xmath12 .",
    "this implies representing the system with a diverging @xmath4 in a vanishing fraction of the phase space volume , in other words , mass belongs only to an infinitesimally thin 3d sheet in 6d phase space .",
    "as @xmath4 is conserved along a characteristics , it implies that this singularity must persist at all subsequent times .",
    "methods to conserve arbitrarily high phase space density have been set up @xcite , but this is not necessarily sufficient .",
    "ideally a physically sound solution @xmath13 to this boltzmann - poisson system should not be numerically sensitive to the initial condition discretization . in practice",
    "it is known that the gravitational @xmath14-body problem is exponentially sensitive to perturbations @xcite , so the best that can be expected in such simulations is that over an ensemble of simulations with identical statistical initial conditions , results follow a reproducible statistical distribution",
    ". detailed evolution of particles is sensitive to perturbations , but the average evolution of an ensemble of particles is predictable .",
    "when @xmath13 is finite and differentiable everywhere , in other words when @xmath13 mathematically exists , the sound situation that should be used , a slight variation of @xmath13 , a fluctuation , will also follow the same set of equations , so , writing @xmath15 , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the differences between the reference @xmath13 and the perturbed solution @xmath4 , and using the fact that @xmath13 is a solution of the system , we obtain the exact equations for the differences @xmath17 , and @xmath18 : @xmath19 @xmath20 so we see that @xmath17 follows the same left - hand side equation than @xmath13 in the unperturbed field @xmath21 , except that now the right - hand side contains a source term whose first term @xmath22 is the product of the force fluctuations @xmath18 times the gradient of the original @xmath13 in velocity space .",
    "thus a vanishing zero thermal velocity for a set of particles supposed to represent a physical @xmath13 is not only suspicious since it corresponds to a delta function in velocity space , but also because the gradient @xmath23 is at least as singular as @xmath13 . in other words",
    "a zero initial thermal width is inconsistent with the initial assumptions , and susceptible to arbitrary strong amplification of perturbations , since the variational equations contain a diverging source term to first order when the initial thermal velocity is small .",
    "the only possibility to cancel this diverging term is either to have vanishing force fluctuations @xmath24 , which is exceptional when @xmath17 is non - zero , or that @xmath24 is orthogonal to @xmath23 , which is also exceptional .",
    "the second order term @xmath25 on the right - hand side can cancel the first term only when @xmath17 is proportional and opposite to @xmath13 , which is also exceptional . in summary dealing with diverging @xmath13 is inconsistent with the implicit assumption of regularity of the mathematical problem .",
    "it is instructive to compare how simulating collisionless fluids is differently approached in the fields of stellar and galactic dynamics . while in cosmology the physical collisionless fluids is assumed to consist of elementary particles , in galactic dynamics the fluid is composed of stars . in both cases the numerical simulation particles are order of magnitudes more massive than the physical particles . in the cdm context",
    "a simulation particle velocity is seen as representing the bulk flow of a large ensemble of cdm particles , explaining why zero velocity dispersion has been assumed . in galactic dynamics in contrast",
    "it is well known that doing so would immediately cause huge gravitational instabilities , and that the correct way to perform collisionless galaxy simulations is to ascribe to the simulation particles the same velocity dispersion as the stars .",
    "this is also required for respecting the virial theorem .",
    "while the use of velocities has been shown @xcite to be of importance for the cdm simulations , in wdm it becomes even more relevant @xcite since the particles do have intrinsic non - zero velocity dispersion .",
    "collisionless fluids are particle mass agnostic , when the particle mass starts to be important is when the 2-body relaxation time is shorter than the system age .",
    "recalling the chandrasekhar 2-body relaxation time in an arbitrarily large homogeneous medium @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the velocity dispersion of @xmath14 particles of mass @xmath28 with average density @xmath1 , it is obvious that this relaxation time is proportional to @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , so is exactly zero when @xmath32",
    ". thus cdm simulations with initial zero @xmath27 are technically collisional until numerical noise heats the particles to larger @xmath27 .    from a completely different side of physics , the maximal phase space density constraint set by heisenberg s inequality",
    ", @xmath33 gives a minimum particle velocity dispersion , taking @xmath34 and @xmath28 the particle mass , @xmath35",
    "\\left[n \\over 1\\ , \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\right]^{1/3 } \\mathrm{km / s } \\ .\\ ] ] taking a velocity dispersion lower than this value violates heisenberg inequality , while taking it only slightly larger means that the particles behaviour is governed by quantum physics , not classical mechanics as assumed in all cosmological @xmath14-body simulations .    in summary , adopting even a slight non - zero velocity dispersion in cosmological simulation is certainly a safer and more correct physical assumption than taking strictly cold initial conditions associated with a mathematically singular and inconsistent state leading to situations not under control on the numerical viewpoint due to singular phase space density .",
    "depending on the wdm particle physics and properties , different scenarios can be considered regarding the particle velocity dispersion as function of redshift . in many scenarios ,",
    "particles are copiously created in ultra - relativistic conditions and very good thermal equilibrium .",
    "as the universe expands they may subsequently decouple on the thermal point of view because their collisional relaxation rate becomes lower than the expansion rate , while still interacting with the rest of matter by gravitational coupling . if the particles do not decay their comoving number density is conserved , and if they follow the collisionless boltzmann equation their phase space density is conserved too .",
    "but this later assumption is more fragile because some residual elastic collisional relaxation processes can still decrease the effective phase space density by coarse graining .      a frequently cited derivation of wdm particle velocities as function of mass and redshift can be found in @xcite . in their appendix",
    "a they recall that for a thermal relict particle x that decouples when relativistic , the abundance @xmath36 relative to photons is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the number of relativistic species present at decoupling , and @xmath39 is the number of spin states of the particle .",
    "connecting then the particle mass density @xmath40 with the cosmological parameters @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where the critical universal density @xmath43 , and the hubble constant @xmath44 , they derive , @xmath45 we confirm this equation when using @xmath46 .",
    "then the authors proceed to derive a velocity formula .",
    "since the distribution function of fermions without chemical potential @xmath47 is proportional to @xmath48 , they point out that if the particles decouple from photons when still relativistic @xmath49 can be replaced by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the particle momentum . to keep phase space density",
    "constant clearly in the relativistic regime @xmath51 must stay proportional to @xmath52 .",
    "but obviously as the regime passes to non - relativistic this argument does not hold , the exact formula valid at all @xmath52 is @xmath53 therefore it seems incorrect to assume that @xmath51 is proportional to @xmath52 also at low @xmath52 .",
    "the exact scaling from eq .",
    "( [ eq : pscaling ] ) becomes @xmath54 , or @xmath55 , that is , the kinetic energy @xmath56 , not the momentum , scales as temperature at all redshifts .",
    "another problem is the derived constant for velocity .",
    "they assume that the distribution function scales as the non - thermal distribution @xmath57 , and give without detail @xmath58 ( in their eq .",
    "( a3 ) ) , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the redshift . but eliminating @xmath61 in this previous equation using eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) ( their eq .",
    "( a2 ) ) , we obtain for a @xmath62kev particle ( rounding also to 2 significant digits ) , @xmath63 thus we find @xmath64 .",
    "this is too high a value for @xmath38 to be endorsed , as mentioned by the authors , by large entropy producing processes .",
    "since the value for @xmath38 varies linearly with the mass of the particle in the given cosmological model ( eq.[eq : omega ] ) , it allows the elimination of @xmath38 from the final expression for velocity .",
    "this high value used for @xmath38 leads to a significant decrease in the particle velocities , as shown in table 1 .    in the minimal standard model",
    "the number of the full set of particles is @xmath65 while in the minimal supersymmetric standard model , the value is increased to @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "previous studies like @xcite use a value of @xmath67 for right - handed neutrinos decoupling before the electroweak phase transition at very high temperatures , while @xcite assume a conservative reference value of 150 for both gravitino and a standard warm dark matter candidate like the massive neutrino .    the lower value for the velocity adopted by @xcite has been used in most wdm simulations thereafter .",
    "this value for @xmath38 , however , is valid for a 1kev particle only if we assume that dark matter is made entirely by these type of particles , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : omega ] ) . for the cases in which a certain warm dark matter particle represents only a fraction of the total dark matter content ,",
    "this value is different and eq .",
    "( [ eq : velocities ] ) needs to be scaled accordingly .",
    "this aspect has been overlooked in some simulation studies of mixed dark matter , providing misleading results as we will show in section 2.3 .",
    "the next line following @xcite eq .  ( a3 ) states : `` the rms velocity is @xmath68 '' .",
    "recalculating the rms velocity of the adopted distribution function @xmath69 we find a slightly larger factor : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is riemann s function . the slight discrepancy ( the 9 digit )",
    "appears thus as a misprint .    in appendix",
    "a we find that the largest correction factor for the rms speed of a fermi - dirac distribution with respect to a maxwellian distribution is 1.07 , not @xmath72 as stated in @xcite .",
    "the difference comes entirely from the very non - thermal distribution .      in the previous @xcite scenario ,",
    "wdm particles are treated as localized mass bullets following boltzmann s equation . however , at creation time they are also assumed to be ultra - relativistic and in thermal equilibrium with radiation and the rest of matter , typically following a fermi - dirac distribution since the known stable particles are fermions .",
    "this entails that their quantum nature does play a role at birth , they are at least semi - degenerate .",
    "phase space density is high enough for the distinction between classical and quantum particles to play a role .",
    "the non - local pauli principle applies then , each particle `` knows '' about the state of each other .",
    "now if phase space density is approximately conserved then particles remain semi - degenerate at all times , which is inconsistent with the usual assumptions applied at low redshifts that they behave as classical particles .",
    "the known neutrinos offer a good example that particles are quantum objects instead of localized mass objects .",
    "real neutrinos are in addition of being fermions also in a superposition of three mass states .",
    "since mass states propagate at different velocities , with time relict neutrinos are actually in a superposition of entangled mass states increasingly spread apart .",
    "how gravitational interaction with matter structures can destroy the coherence of these entangled states is a question that will need to be addressed in future works .    here",
    "we develop a procedure to calculate precisely the particle velocity valid in all relativistic regimes for fermions or bosons .",
    "the full distribution fermi - dirac or bose - einstein distribution reads ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the particle momentum , @xmath75 the spin - degeneracy factor ( of order 1 or 2 ) , @xmath47 the chemical potential , @xmath76 the particle energy , @xmath28 the particle mass , and @xmath77 the particle temperature .",
    "the comoving number density is calibrated according to a neutrino - like scenario where the particles are once coupled to the photon background and in thermal contact , at a time where gravitational perturbations are still linear .    first , the assumption that the chemical potential @xmath47 is constant and negligible is not necessarily valid for identical fermions which are created in a half - degenerate state .",
    "the pauli principle has for effect that identical fermions , even with negligible interaction ( like the weak nuclear force for neutrinos ) , possess an effective _ exchange potential _ , also sometimes called _ exchange - correlation potential _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in quantum chemistry and density functional theory ( dft )",
    "the exchange potential is well known to be essential in the hamiltonian describing electrons around a nucleus , or electrons in materials , although the exact form in different contexts is sometimes not well known . in the cosmological context",
    "the exchange potential changes the chemical potential as the spatial density of identical fermions changes .",
    "this effective repulsive interaction for fermions makes the collisionless assumption of free fermions much less obvious . in @xcite",
    "the effective interaction of free fermions was illustrated by solving exactly the time - dependent schrdinger equation for two free but identical fermions in 3d space starting as gaussian wave packets . in the quantum regime ( high phase space density )",
    "these wave packets effectively interact and are scattered due to the repulsive exchange potential . in the classical regime ( low phase space density ) the wave - packets follow , as expected , a straight trajectory .    in quantum statistical mechanics @xcite the exchange potential between two particles has a well known form dependent on temperature and distance @xmath78 @xmath79 where the @xmath80 sign applies for fermions and @xmath81 for bosons , and @xmath82 is de broglie wavelength . for semi - degenerate particles @xmath82 is of order of @xmath83 , so in a semi - classical description fermions `` feel '' a rapidly varying repulsive force from neighbouring particles , while bosons an attractive force .",
    "the reality of the exchange potential can be invoked to cast a doubt that the commonly assumed collisionless approximation for semi - degenerate particles is valid in the cosmological context .",
    "instead one should expect a local thermalization of identical particles on a short time - scale .    to calculate the chemical potential evolution in the cosmological context",
    ", one needs therefore an additional assumption , besides number conservation .",
    "the particle momentum and kinetic energy can not be assumed conserved due to the global gravitational interaction .",
    "a reasonable assumption @xcite is that the expanding medium proceeds adiabatically , at least as long as gravitational clustering is linear .",
    "this means that the particle specific entropy can be taken as a conserved quantity .",
    "the entropy @xmath84 expressed as a function of other thermodynamical variables reads ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * vol .",

    "actually the 1.9k value is valid for massless neutrinos only .",
    "the difference comes from the misleading use of temperature as an equivalent concept for energy and vice versa , while the neutrino rest mass energy does not contribute to thermal energy .",

    "the velocity coefficient is found to be @xmath113 , intermediate between the fermi - dirac and bose - einstein cases .",
    "the correction of quantum statistics with respect to a maxwellian distribution remains thus small , as demonstrated in appendix a.      since collisionless physics does not depend on the particle mass , the power spectrum must directly depend only on the velocity distribution of the particles , which results from the particle production mechanism .",

    "<S> the damping on the fluctuation spectrum and the presence of thermal velocities as properties of warm dark matter particles like sterile neutrinos imprint a distinct signature found from the structure formation mechanisms to the internal structures of halos . using warm dark matter simulations we explore these effects on the structure formation for different particle energies and we find that the formation of structure is more complex than originally assumed , a combination of top - down collapse and hierarchical ( bottom - up ) clustering on multiple scales . </S>",
    "<S> the degree on which one scenario is more prominent with respect to the other depends globally on the energy of the particle and locally on the morphology and architecture of the analyzed region . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of shells and caustics in warm dark matter halos is another important effect seen in simulations . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore we discuss the impact of thermal velocities on the structure formation from theoretical considerations as well as from the analysis of the simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we re - examine the assumptions considered when estimating the velocity dispersion for warm dark matter particles that have been adopted in previous works for more than a decade and we give an independent estimation for the velocities . </S>",
    "<S> we identify some inconsistencies in previous published results . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the warm dark matter particle mass and its corresponding velocity dispersion is strongly model dependent , hence the constraints on particle mass from simulation results are weak . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we review the technical difficulties that arise in warm dark matter simulations along with possible improvements of the methods .    </S>",
