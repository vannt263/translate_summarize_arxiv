    "<S> fractional repetition ( fr ) codes is a family of codes for distributed storage systems ( dss ) that allow uncoded exact repairs with minimum repair bandwidth . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we consider a bound on the maximum amount of data that can be stored using an fr code . </S>",
    "<S> optimal fr codes which attain this bound are presented . </S>",
    "<S> the constructions of these fr codes are based on families of regular graphs , such as turn graphs and graphs with large girth ; and on combinatorial designs , such as transversal designs and generalized polygons . in addition , based on a connection between fr codes and batch codes , we propose a new family of codes for dss , called fractional repetition batch codes , which allow uncoded efficient exact repairs and load balancing which can be performed by several users in parallel . </S>"
