    "ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions provide an opportunity for exploring strongly interacting qcd matter under extreme conditions which is the ultimate goal of heavy - ion experiments at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the experiments at the rhic and the lhc have demonstrated that a stage of partonic matter is produced in these reactions which is in an approximate equilibrium for a few fm / c  @xcite . due to the non - perturbative and non - equilibrium nature of relativistic nuclear reaction systems ,",
    "their theoretical description is based essentially on a variety of effective models ranging from hydrodynamic models with different initial conditions  @xcite to various kinetic approaches  @xcite or different types of hybrid models @xcite that employ conceptually different assumptions on the initial conditions . in",
    "the latter approaches the initial state models are followed by an ideal or viscous hydro phase which after freeze - out is completed by a hadronic cascade simulation .",
    "however , a commonly accepted and complete picture is still lacking and precise data from the rhic and lhc are expected to clarify the situation .",
    "the actual questions addressed in this study are whether the initial state of the colliding nuclei behaves like a superposition of its constituents or as a coherent gluon field as predicted in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we address the problem of how to disentangle the different initial state scenarios in final state observables .    the different phenomenological models that successfully describe heavy - ion data include coherence effects in the initial state which can be identified at the level of the wave function and also at the level of primary particle production . a complete , qcd - based , dynamical description of the coherence effects is provided within the color glass condensate concept ( cf .",
    "the reviews  @xcite ) . here , gluon shadowing is taken into account through nonlinear renormalization group equations , i.e.  the bk - jimwlk evolution of classical yang - mills equations that describe gluon fusion at soft momentum scales .",
    "they imply the emergence of a dynamical transverse momentum scale , the saturation scale @xmath1 , such that gluon modes with transverse momentum @xmath2 are in the saturation regime  @xcite .",
    "such a saturation / suppression of gluon densities is equivalent to the presence of strong coherent color fields .",
    "unfortunately , there is no direct experimental observable that proves the existence of such coherent color fields ( or cgc ) . to validate the cgc approach",
    ", one should compare different observables calculated within cgc models with alternative approaches that do not involve the concept of coherent color fields .",
    "conventional descriptions of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion reactions are ideal or viscous hydrodynamic models @xcite or hybrid approaches  @xcite which can be examined also on an event - by - event basis  @xcite . in these hydro calculations the initial conditions  at some finite starting time of the order of 0.5 fm / c  have to be evaluated either in terms of the ( standard ) glauber model or other initial state scenarios like in the ip - glasma model  @xcite or the cgc approach , respectively .",
    "differences between the different initial state assumptions and dynamical evolutions thus have to be expected .",
    "the applicability of ideal or viscous hydrodynamic models to proton - nucleus reactions for low multiplicity events , however , is very much debated .",
    "this also holds for hybrid models as long as they employ a hydro phase .    the flow harmonics @xmath3 have been found to be sensitive to the early stage of nuclear interaction and in particular their fluctuations .",
    "indeed , the detailed heavy - ion analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that monte carlo cgc approaches ( mc - cgc ) systematically give a larger initial eccentricity than glauber models .",
    "however , it is unclear to what extent such properties of the cgc formalism are robust with respect to extended correlations . also , studies of higher harmonics  as presented in  @xcite by the phenix or alice collaborations",
    " do not clearly favor the cgc or glauber assumptions for the initial state of the collision .",
    "the first lhc data on the bulk particle production in pb - pb collisions are in good agreement with improved cgc expectations but they are also compatible with monte carlo event generators  @xcite .",
    "both models have in common that they include some coherence effects.    the complexity of heavy - ion collisions is reduced essentially in the case of proton - nucleus collisions owing to the expected dominance of the initial state effects .",
    "recently , the first preliminary alice measurement of the charged particle pseudorapidity density has been reported  @xcite for @xmath4  2 in p - pb collisions at a nucleon - nucleon center - of - mass energy @xmath0 5.02 tev .",
    "the measurement is compared to two sets of particle production models that describe similar measurements for other collision systems : the saturation models employing coherence effects  @xcite and the two - component models combining perturbative qcd processes with soft interactions  @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the model calculations with the data shows that the results are model - dependent and predict the measured multiplicity values only within 20@xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , the restrictions imposed by the measured minimal bias pseudorapidity spectra @xmath6 are not sufficient to disentangle different models for the very early interaction stage of ultrarelativistic collisions .",
    "a large set of various characteristic predicted in the compilation  @xcite for p - pb collisions at 5.02 tev is still waiting for a proper analysis / comparison .",
    "a test of color coherence in proton - nucleus collisions at the lhc energy has been proposed in ref .",
    "the idea of this proposal is based on the fact that the observed mean multiplicity of charged particles @xmath7 linearly depends on the number of participants @xmath8 within the wounded nucleon model ( wnm ) of independent nucleon - nucleon scatterings , @xmath9 , while in the cgc models this dependence is logarithmic , @xmath10 . for a small number of participants , @xmath11  10 ,",
    "the mean multiplicities calculated in both approaches practically coincide ( in agreement with experiment ) but for @xmath12  25 they differ by almost a factor of two  @xcite .",
    "such large numbers of participant are possible at the lhc energy of 5.02 tev in p - pb collisions .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite there should be a sizeable difference in the mean transverse momentum of particles versus the pseudorapidity @xmath13 with opposite slopes in @xmath14 on the projectile side within the cgc framework relative to hydrodynamical calculations due the saturation scale @xmath1 in the cgc .",
    "following these suggestions we here study the charged particle multiplicities and related quantities in p - pb interactions at the collision energy @xmath0  5.02 tev within the parton - hadron - string - dynamics ( phsd ) transport approach  @xcite which has been properly upgraded to lhc energies with respect to a more recent pythia implementation ( sec .",
    "predictions for various observables and their correlations are given in sec .",
    "iii which are also compared to available data as well as to results from cgc saturation models .",
    "we conclude our findings in sec .  iv .",
    "the phsd model is a covariant dynamical approach for strongly interacting systems formulated on the basis of kadanoff - baym equations  @xcite or off - shell transport equations in phase - space representation , respectively . in the kadanoff - baym theory",
    "the field quanta are described in terms of dressed propagators with complex selfenergies . whereas the real part of the selfenergies can be related to mean - field potentials ( of lorentz scalar , vector or tensor type ) , the imaginary parts provide information about the lifetime and/or reaction rates of time - like particles  @xcite .",
    "once the proper ( complex ) selfenergies of the degrees of freedom are known , the time evolution of the system is fully governed by off - shell transport equations ( as described in refs .",
    "this approach allows for a simple and transparent interpretation of lattice qcd results for thermodynamic quantities as well as correlators and leads to effective strongly interacting partonic quasiparticles with broad spectral functions . for a review on off - shell transport theory",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite ; model results and their comparison with experimental observables for heavy - ion collisions from the lower super - proton - synchrotron ( sps ) to rhic energies can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite including electromagnetic probes such as @xmath15 or @xmath16 pairs  @xcite .",
    "we mention that the phsd model takes into account some kind of coherent effects with respect to qcd showers since it includes corrections to the leading - log picture  denoted as coherence effects  that lead to an ordering of subsequent emissions in terms of decreasing angles .    to extend the phsd model to higher energies than @xmath17  gev at rhic",
    ", we have additionally implemented the pythia 6.4 generator  @xcite for initial nucleon collisions at lhc energies .",
    "for the subsequent ( lower energy ) collisions the standard phsd model  @xcite is applied ( including pythia v5.5 with jetset v7.3 for the production and fragmentation of jets  @xcite , i.e.  for @xmath18 500 gev  @xcite ) . in this way",
    "all results from phsd up to top rhic energies are regained and a proper extension to lhc energies is achieved . at @xmath19",
    "500 gev both pythia versions lead to very similar results . in pythia 6.4",
    "we use the innsbruck pp tune ( 390 ) which allows to describe reasonably the p - p collisions at @xmath20 7 tev in the framework of the phsd transport approach ( cf .",
    "[ fig : pp ] ) . here",
    "the overall agreement with lhc experimental data for the distribution in the charged particle multiplicity @xmath21 ( a ) , the charged particle pseudorapidity distribution ( b ) , the transverse momentum @xmath22 spectra ( c ) and the correlation of the average @xmath22 with the number of charged particles ( d ) is satisfactory .",
    "one should note that the experimental results of different lhc collaborations slightly differ ( within errorbars ) .",
    "in particular , the pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions of the cms collaboration are slightly below those of the atlas collaboration .",
    "in addition , different pythia tunes , being generally in satisfactory agreement with pp data and tuned to specific observables , describe the tails of @xmath21 and @xmath22 distributions with different quality .",
    "although pythia 6.4 includes some elements of coherence in the creation of particles ( by string fusion , string fragmentation , quasiparticle spectral densities etc . ) it deviates substantially from the early interaction stage in the cgc approach  @xcite .",
    "we mention that initial state fluctuations in hydro calculations are usually imposed by independent glauber model simulations or mc - kln initial conditions  @xcite , respectively .",
    "initial conditions very similar to the glauber model are included by default in the phsd transport approach , however , with an essential difference : the energy - momentum conservation is fulfilled exactly in every collision such that the entire dynamics conserves four - momentum as well as all discrete conservation laws .",
    "we recall that the phsd approach has been tested successfully for collective flows @xmath23 and @xmath24 in nucleus - nucleus collisions from lower super - proton - synchrotron ( sps ) up to rhic energies  @xcite where especially the uneven flow coefficients are sensitive to the initial state fluctuations .",
    "accordingly , the initial fluctuations in energy density - in the transverse plane - from phsd are in accord with experimental observation",
    ".    it has been argued , furthermore , that in high energy p - a collisions the glauber model should be corrected / extended to account for the fact that between successive interactions the incoming proton is off - shell  @xcite and may fluctuate in size .",
    "in addition , event - to - event fluctuations in the configuration of the incoming proton can change its effective scattering cross section as noted in refs .",
    "the concept of hadronic cross - section fluctuations incorporates the physics of color transparency and color opacity into the dynamics of relativistic nuclear collisions . in order to evaluate the impact of these fluctuations of the projectile proton , a modified version of the glauber monte carlo , referred to as glauber - gribov mc , is implemented additionally / optionally in the phsd . following refs .",

    "the phsd model predicts the @xmath70 distribution ( blue solid line ) to be rather close to the hydrodynamic models since also in phsd the collectivity is correlated with the density of degrees of freedom which decreases with forward rapidity ( cf .",

    "our results within the dynamical phsd calculations are only slightly above the cgc predictions and glauber - gribov cross section fluctuations practically do not influence the observables investigated .",
    "accordingly , the considered quantities ,  multiplicity , average transverse momentum , their distributions and correlations ,  do not allow for a firm conclusion on the presence ( or absence ) of a color glass condensate in a pb - nucleus at 5.02 tev .",
    "however , we have found that it is more promising to measure the @xmath73 distribution ( suggested in  @xcite ) to obtain a more conclusive result since our phsd calculations provide results very close to hydro calculations with a slope opposite to the cgc models .",

    "<S> the parton - hadron - string - dynamics ( phsd ) transport model is employed for p - pb collisions at @xmath0 5.02 tev and compared to recent experimental data from the lhc as well as to alternative models . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the question of initial state dynamics , i.e. if the initial state might be approximated by a superposition of independent nucleon - nucleon collisions or should be considered as a coherent gluon field as predicted within the color glass condensate ( cgc ) framework . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the phsd approach provides correlations between the charged particle multiplicity at midrapidity and the number of participant nucleons close to results from the cgc and differs substantially from results calculated with independent glauber initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> however , a sizeable difference is found between the phsd approach and cgc models with respect to the rapidity dependence of the average transverse momentum . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , related measurements at lhc should allow to prove or disprove the presence of coherent colour fields in the initial phase of the collisions . </S>"
