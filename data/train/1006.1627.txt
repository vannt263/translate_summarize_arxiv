    "studies of the frequency , parameter distributions and correlations of extrasolar planets require homogeneous samples of hundreds of planets to obtain statistically significant results .",
    "moreover , such a sample must have well - understood completeness limits , selection effects and biases , which are easiest to obtain from a single , large - scale survey .",
    "given current constraints on the frequency of giant planets , detection of such a large sample of planetary systems generally requires a precision radial velocity ( rv ) survey of many thousands of stars .",
    "such a survey also provides a wealth of ancillary science .",
    "in particular , it is exquisitely sensitive to more massive companions , and because it targets a large and broad sample of host stars , it is naturally sensitive to rare binary systems in poorly explored regions of parameter space .    of particular interest",
    "are constraints on the frequency and parameter distributions of low - mass companions to solar - type stars with masses near the hydrogen burning limit .",
    "one of the early results from precise rv searches was the apparent paucity of brown dwarf companions with minimum masses ( @xmath9 ) at separations of @xmath10  au , relative to more massive stellar companions and less massive planetary companions @xcite .",
    "note that we denote @xmath11 as the inclination angle between the companion s orbital angular momentum vector and the line - of - sight , and we reserve @xmath12 as the inclination angle of the stellar rotation axis to the line - of - sight . while the frequency of brown dwarf companions at larger separations is still relatively uncertain ( e.g. , @xcite ) ,",
    "a meta - analysis of sets of known companions to solar - type stars by @xcite , with corrections for observational bias , confirmed the lack of brown dwarfs at close separations .",
    "these authors place the ` driest ' part of the brown dwarf desert at @xmath13 , with a frequency of companions @xmath14 in this range of masses .",
    "although there has been a steady increase in the number of known brown dwarf candidates via the rv technique @xcite , most of these detections have been at separations @xmath15 0.8 au .",
    "notable exceptions include the transiting brown dwarf corot - exo-3b with a period of @xmath16 days orbiting an f3v star @xcite , and hd41004bb with a period of @xmath17 day orbiting the m dwarf component of a k - m binary system @xcite .",
    "brown dwarfs at such short orbital separations are of particular interest for several reasons .",
    "first , the frequency of such systems as a function of their physical and orbital parameters provide diagnostics that may be able to distinguish between the various mechanisms that have been invoked for their formation and dynamical evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , these systems offer observational constraints on the poorly - understood theory of tidal interactions between host stars and close companions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , these systems are much more likely to transit than their longer - period counterparts , as the transit probability is inversely proportional to orbital separation .",
    "transiting systems yield valuable measurements on the masses , radii , and mean densities of brown dwarfs @xcite .    here",
    "we report the discovery of a candidate short - period , brown dwarf companion to the metal - rich star tyc 2949 - 00557 - 1 , a main sequence f star with apparent brightness @xmath18 .",
    "this companion was discovered as part of the multi - object apo radial velocity exoplanet large - area survey ( marvels ) pilot project ( hereafter mpp ) .",
    "the mpp used the w. m. keck exoplanet tracker ( keck et ) instrument @xcite on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) 2.5 m telescope @xcite at the apache point observatory .",
    "the keck et instrument is a multi - object ( 59 targets per exposure ) , dispersed fixed - delay interferometer ( dfdi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this instrument",
    ", fiber - fed starlight from the telescope is first passed through an iodine cell that acts as a stable wavelength reference .",
    "this light is then fed through a fixed - delay interferometer controlled via a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) , and finally through a spectrograph that has a spectral resolution of r @xmath19 .",
    "radial velocity information is then imprinted in the phases of the fringes perpendicular to the dispersion axis of the spectrum due to a fixed variation in the interferometer delay along this direction .",
    "the primary goal of the mpp was to demonstrate a fully - integrated dfdi instrument capable of observing multiple stars in a single exposure .",
    "the second goal was to demonstrate that such an instrument is capable of achieving doppler rv precision sufficient for extrasolar planet detection .",
    "the final goal was to formulate an operations procedure for conducting a survey using the keck et instrument in an efficient manner .",
    "these three goals were necessary preparations for the marvels @xcite survey : a multi - object , dfdi , extrasolar planet survey that is part of sloan digital sky survey iii ( sdss - iii ) .    the marvels pilot project was conducted in 2007 , and consisted of 5 - 38 observations of 708 stars taken over 1 - 5 month baselines . although the primary purpose of the mpp was to lay the groundwork for the full marvels survey , the cadence , number , and precision of the mpp was nevertheless sufficient to detect massive companions to a number of the target stars .",
    "the rv data for each star was initially fit using the rvsim program @xcite .",
    "the companion to tyc 2949 - 00557 - 1 emerged as an excellent candidate , and here we describe the discovery radial velocity data , as well as additional spectroscopic and photometric data acquired to confirm the companion and further characterize the host star .",
    "tyc 2949 - 00557 - 1b is the first low - mass companion detected with a multi - object , dispersed , fixed - delay interferometer ; previous observations with a single - object dfdi instrument at kitt peak national observatory resulted in the first extrasolar planet discovered via this technique @xcite , as well as the first confirmed planet via dfdi @xcite and the ability to measure precise , absolute radial velocities with dfdi @xcite .",
    "the mpp targeted 708 f , g , and k dwarfs with @xmath20 in 12 different fields , each containing 59 stars .",

    "targets that have @xmath21 @xmath24 25 either have intrinsically large rv variability , or they are stars with line - of - sight rotational velocities @xmath2510 km s@xmath26 , from which we are unable to extract precise rv measurements . tyc 2949 - 00557 - 1",
    "was identified from a field with 58 other targets as having a @xmath21 of 37.20 , in this case indicative of its binary nature .",
    "a total of 14 usable doppler rv measurements were obtained spanning 116 days from jan - apr 2007 .",
    "table [ aporvs ] contains the barycentric julian date using the barycentric dynamical time standard ( bjd@xmath27 ) , measured doppler rv and associated errors for all 14 observations .",
    "the doppler velocities presented in table [ aporvs ] are absolute velocities calibrated to the solar spectrum , and are the sum of the barycentric velocity of the system and the additional doppler variability caused by the companion . in order to provide an indication of the true level of systematic errors in the mpp data for objects in this field , we note that the 47 ( likely constant ) targets with @xmath28 in this field have a median quality factor of 3.25 .",
    "we searched for periodicity in the doppler data for tyc 2949 - 00557 - 1 using a lomb - scargle periodogram with floating mean @xcite . the resulting power spectrum is shown in fig .  [ power ] , revealing a clear peak at @xmath29 with a power of @xmath30 . to assess the significance of this peak , we ran a monte carlo simulation with @xmath31 trials . for each trial",
    ", we scrambled the times of the data points , computed the periodogram , and recorded the most significant peak .",
    "we found no trials with power greater than that of actual data , indicating a false alarm probability of @xmath32 .",
    "the advantage of a multi - object instrument is that the multiple targets that are observed simultaneously can be used to check for common systematics trends in data .",
    "thus , as an additional check on the reliability of the observations , we constructed periodograms for the other 58 objects on the plate and calculated the power for each object at the period of the suspected companion .",
    "any common systematics present in the data due to the sampling rate or instrumental effects will result in significant power at a common period for other targets .",
    "none of the other 58 targets have significant power at the period of tyc 2949 - 00557 - 1 ; the next strongest candidate has an fap at that period of 77% and the other targets have faps @xmath24 99% .",
    "the best - fit amplitude derived from the periodogram is @xmath33 , indicating a minimum mass in the brown dwarf regime for an fgk - type primary .",
    "given that brown dwarf companions in this period range are rare , we decided to obtain additional precise radial velocity measurements , high - resolution spectra , absolute photometry , and precise relative photometry time series , in order to better characterize the primary and ascertain the nature of the companion .",
    "observations for the purpose of confirming the doppler variability and orbit were conducted with the exoplanet tracker ( et ) instrument @xcite at the kitt peak national observatory with the 2.1 m telescope .",
    "two observations separated by several hours were taken each night over seven consecutive nights starting on oct .  10 , 2008 .",
    "a total of eleven usable epochs were obtained .",
    "integrations consisted of 60-min exposures bracketed by exposures of a tungsten lamp passing through an iodine gas cell that acts as a calibration for instrument drift .",
    "each arm of the interferometer produces a dfdi spectrum from which radial velocities are measured .",
    "the two beams are processed separately , and their measured radial velocities are combined via a weighted average based on the rv uncertainties .",
    "table [ kpnorvs ] contains the dates and velocities for the kpno et measurements . unlike the results from the mpp , the velocities presented in table [ kpnorvs ] are relative rvs , i.e. , measured relative to one of the epochs . note",
    "that none of the velocities are exactly zero because an instrumental drift has been subtracted off based on the calibration lamps , and they are zeroed to a different epoch than the star .",
    "because these data are relative rvs , an offset exists between the values in table [ aporvs ] and table [ kpnorvs ] that must be included as an additional parameter when performing a combined analysis of the two data sets .",
    "observations of the candidate were also conducted using the r=60,000 mode of the hrs spectrograph @xcite on the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) telescope @xcite in the queue scheduled mode @xcite .",
    "the spectra consisted of 46 echelle orders recorded on the `` blue '' ccd detector ( 407.6 - 592 nm ) and 24 orders on the `` red '' one ( 602 - 783.8 nm ) .",
    "the spectral data used for rv measurements were extracted from the 17 orders that cover the 505 - 592 nm range of the iodine spectrum .",
    "a total of ten doppler rv measurements were obtained spanning 83 days from dec 2008 through feb 2009 .",
    "the starlight was passed through an iodine cell to provide a stable reference to calibrate instrument drift .",
    "two exposures without the iodine cell were taken to act as stellar templates . due to the faintness of the target ,",
    "the rvs were computed relative to each template and a mean value was determined .",
    "the results for both templates agree to within three sigma .",
    "table [ hetrvs ] contains the dates and velocities for the het measurements .",
    "similar to the results from the kpno et in table [ kpnorvs ] , these velocities are relative rvs , and therefore an offset exists between these values and the ones in both table [ aporvs ] and table [ kpnorvs ] .      in order to check for consistency",
    ", we first fit the mpp , kpno and het datasets individually to a seven parameter rv fit , where the seven parameters are the velocity semi - amplitude @xmath34 , eccentricity @xmath35 , argument of periastron @xmath36 , period @xmath37 , time of inferior conjunction of the companion @xmath38 , velocity zero point @xmath39 , and linear slope @xmath40 ( in order to allow for additional companions or systematic drifts ) .",
    "the best - fit solution was found using a hybrid downhill - simplex fit to the nonlinear parameters and an exact ( linear ) fit to the linear parameters .",
    "there are 14 mpp points , 11 kpno points and 10 het points , so there are seven , four and three degrees of freedom ( dof ) , respectively .    for the mpp fit ,",
    "we find a @xmath41 of 44 .",
    "given that the data points basically follow the model , and that the more precise het data ( whose error bars are overestimated , see below ) fit the model well , the large @xmath41 indicates that there are systematic uncertainties in addition to the photon noise , and thus the errors are severely underestimated .",
    "given the large median @xmath21=3.25 found for the majority of the ( likely constant ) stars in this field , this result is not surprising . indeed , there is a known systematic error in dfdi when utilizing an iodine cell in the stellar beam path @xcite . for the kpno fit",
    "we find a @xmath41 of 6.96 , once again indicating the uncertainties are underestimated .",
    "for the het fit , we find a @xmath41 of 0.09 , therefore the uncertainties are likely overestimated for the het dataset .",
    "it is worth noting that a statistically significant slope is found when fitting the het data .",
    "fitting the het data without a slope produces a significantly worse @xmath41 .",
    "we performed additional rv fitting to test the significance of the het slope .",
    "fitting the het data with no slope and eccentricity forced to zero still results in a @xmath42 .",
    "since this is the simplest model of an orbiting companion , it confirms the het uncertainties are overestimated .",
    "several different models , in which slope is a free parameter , eccentricity is a free parameter , or both are free parameters , all result in lower @xmath41 .",
    "there is no evidence of nonzero eccentricity in any of the best - fit solutions , but a significant slope is found in all cases when left as a free parameter . to be self - consistent , we allow for slopes in the mpp and kpno data fitting as well , and note that their best - fit slopes are consistent with the het value , but are much more poorly constrained due to the much larger rv uncertainties in those data sets .",
    "as a final check , we fit all data sets with eccentricity forced to zero and no slope , and find that the other orbital parameters are not qualitatively different from the result where slope is left as a free parameter .",
    "we therefore choose the case of zero eccentricity and non - zero slope as our preferred solution .",
    "uncertainties in the fitting parameters will be inaccurate if it is determined using misestimated rv errors .",
    "it is therefore important to attempt to correct the errors such that @xmath43 .",
    "however , given that we do not know why the errors are misestimated , particularly in the case of underestimated errors , the appropriate method to correct the uncertainties is not clear .",
    "our approach was to try several different ways of correcting the errors to force @xmath44 .",
    "specifically we investigated four different cases for treatment of the mpp ( kpno data come from a similar pipeline ) and het rv uncertainties : a scaling of the errors by a constant factor , an addition in quadrature of a constant error , a removal of suspected outliers based on the magnitude of the rv uncertainty followed by scaling , and a treatment of all data points with a constant error value .",
    "ten markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) simulations were run for each case .",
    "the starting values for the parameters in these chains were chosen to span a range that is large with respect to the expected @xmath45 uncertainty , and the chains were stopped after reaching convergence as defined in @xcite , and then the chains were merged .    analyzing the mpp and het data",
    "separately yields discrepant periods at the @xmath46 level for all cases of error treatment .",
    "we also found that the choice of error treatment can affect the derived value of @xmath47 from the mpp data as well at the @xmath48 level .",
    "however , the other parameters from the mpp data , as well as all parameter values from the het data , were not significantly affected by different treatments of the uncertainties . from this test",
    ", we conclude that there is no strong justification for removing any data points from the fit , so we conducted the final joint analysis of all three datasets where the each set of errors are scaled by a constant factor .",
    "the mpp errors are scaled by a factor of 6.64 , the kpno errors are scaled by 2.64 , and the het errors are scaled by a factor of 0.3 such that the reduced @xmath49 is @xmath50 1 when each is fit independently .",
    "the fit including eccentricity as a free - parameter is consistent with zero eccentricity , therefore we run a second fit that forces @xmath51 . in that case",
    "the error scalings are factors of \\{6.82 , 2.71 , 0.24 } for mpp , kpno and het , respectively .",
    "we further scale the errors of all three data sets by a factor of 1.30 for the case where eccentricity is left as a free parameter , and 1.25 for the case where eccentricity is fixed to zero .",
    "this scaling is done so that the @xmath44 in the combined fit , and is necessary due to the systematics present in the data sets . given the close separation of the companion ,",
    "it is expected that the orbit has been tidally circularized , consistent with our findings .",
    "we therefore treat the case with eccentricity fixed at zero as our final values , but quote the parameters from both cases in table [ finalresults : orbit ] , which contains the values of the orbital parameters for the case of non - zero eccentricity ( eccentric ) and eccentricity fixed at 0 ( circular ) .",
    "[ finalfit ] shows the final results of the joint rv fitting and fixing the eccentricity at 0 .",
    "mpp data are the blue squares , kpno data are the green triangles , het data are the red circles , and the systemic velocity @xmath52 has been removed .",
    "we find @xmath53 for the star , with an offset between the mpp and kpno data of @xmath54 and an offset between the mpp and het data of @xmath55 .",
    "the final orbital period is determined to be @xmath5 days and an rv semi - amplitude of 6.113 @xmath56 0.009 km s@xmath26 .",
    "we searched for an additional signal in the residuals from the joint fit that might be caused by an additional companion in the system , but found no other frequencies with significant power .",
    "photometric observations are an important step in analyzing low - mass companions discovered via the doppler technique .",
    "high - precision photometry can be used to search for transits of the companion .",
    "additionally , time - series photometry can be used to rule out stellar mechanisms of doppler variability , such as chromospheric activity due to starspots or stellar pulsations . in the case of stars with detectable starspots",
    ", time - series photometry can be used to determine a stellar rotation rate . in this section",
    "we present and analyze time series relative photometry of tyc-2949 - 00557 - 1 from two sources : relatively precise ( few mmags ) photometry covering a relatively short timespan ( 2 - 8 hours over five nights ) from the hereford arizona observatory , and less precise ( few percent ) , but more comprehensive photometry consisting of 7194 epochs taken over roughly three years as part of the kilodegree extremely little telescope ( kelt ) north transit survey .",
    "neither datasets show any evidence for variability of the host star .",
    "initial photometric observations of the primary were performed on four nights in 2009 ( 2/19 , 2/21 , 2/27 , and 3/16 ) at the hereford arizona observatory ( observatory code g95 in the iau minor planet center ) , a private facility in southern arizona .",
