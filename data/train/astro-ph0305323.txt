    "low - mass young stellar objects ( ysos ) are classified along their evolutionary phases into classes 0 , i , ii , and iii based on their infrared ( ir ) to sub - millimeter spectral energy distributions ( lada 1991 ; andr@xmath4 et  al .",
    "1993 ; andr@xmath4 , montmerle 1994 ) .",
    "class 0 and i sources correspond to the youngest and evolved protostars , while class ii and iii sources roughly correspond to classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) and weak - lined t tauri stars ( wttss ) , respectively .",
    "low - mass ttss ( = cttss and wttss ) were first discovered to emit significant x - rays with the einstein observatory ( feigelson , decampli 1981 ; feigelson , kriss 1981 ; montmerle et  al .",
    "1983 ) . the following observations with asca and rosat found x - rays from class i sources ( koyama et  al . 1994",

    "1997 ; grosso et  al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ; tsuboi 1999 ; tsuboi et  al .",
    "2000 ; grosso 2001 ) . in addition ,",
    "tsuboi et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported on the hard x - ray emission from class 0 candidates using the chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) .",
    "thus , it is now widely known that low - mass ysos commonly emit x - rays during most of their evolutionary phases .",
    "although it is not clear for class 0 sources , x - ray emission from most ysos is explained by a thermal plasma with temperatures of 1 to a few  kev and rapid time variances , which are similar to those of the solar x - rays .",
    "accordingly , the x - ray origin is generally thought to be solar - type magnetic activity : amplification of the magnetic field followed by magnetic reconnection associated with the stellar convection layer and differential rotation ( feigelson , decampli 1981 ; montmerle et  al .",
    "1983 ) . however , whether or not the x - ray emission differs systematically along the evolutionary phases and stellar masses is not yet known .",
    "on the other hand , the x - ray emission of high - mass main - sequence ( ms ) stars is described by a thin thermal plasma model with relatively soft temperatures of less than 1  kev , and shows moderate variability .",
    "lucy and white ( 1980 ) proposed that these features are due to the plasma heating attributable to the collision of the accelerated stellar wind with circumstellar matter .",
    "however , our understanding of x - ray emission from high- and intermediate - mass ysos is largely behind the low - mass sources and high - mass ms stars , because the former evolve very quickly and the population is small ; hence , they constitute fewer or more distant samples than those of low - mass ysos . since ysos are generally located in dense cloud cores , not only optical / near - infrared ( nir ) light but also soft x - rays suffer large extinction .",
    "accordingly , hard x - ray imaging instruments are essential to resolve embedded ysos in the cores .",
    "the cxo ( weisskopf et  al . 2002 ) , with a high spatial resolution , large field of view ( fov ) , wide energy range and moderate energy resolution , provides the best instruments for observing the star - forming regions ( sfrs ) .",
    "the monoceros r2 cloud ( hereafter mon r2 ) is one of the closest high - mass sfrs , which is located at a distance of 830  pc ( racine 1968 ) .",
    "the cloud age is @xmath01  myr ( carpenter et  al .",
    "1997 ) , providing numerous ysos over a wide range of ages from protostars to wttss .",
    "the core mass is @xmath01000 @xmath5",
    "( tafalla et  al . 1997 ) , which is two orders of magnitude larger than those of the cores of low- to intermediate - mass sfrs .",
    "thus , mon r2 is a good candidate for a systematic study of the x - ray emission along the evolutionary phases and a study of high - mass star formation .",
    "the first x - ray observation on mon r2 was made with the rosat satellite ( gregorio - hetem et  al .",
    "however , the spatial resolution was limited to resolve individual ysos in the mon r2 core .",
    "also , a short exposure ( @xmath09500 s ) observation and poor sensitivity in the hard energy band limited the possibility to detect most of the embedded ysos .",
    "then , the asca observation on mon r2 ( hamaguchi et  al . 2000 ) also could not resolve individual ysos due to the limited spatial resolution of @xmath6 .",
    "recently , kohno et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) performed a cxo observation and resolved x - rays from many ysos for the first time .",
    "the earlier results have already been reported by kohno et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and preibisch et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , but concentrated only on the central @xmath7 region .",
    "this paper reports on a follow - up analysis of the cxo data in the entire cloud core and the nir cluster of mon r2 .",
    "the purposes of this paper are ( 1 ) to make a comprehensive x - ray catalog , ( 2 ) to discuss the x - ray properties as a function of the evolutionary phases and the masses of ysos , and ( 3 ) to discuss the characteristics of x - ray sources by comparing the spatial distribution of the x - ray and nir sources .",
    "mon r2 was observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board the cxo on 2000 december 24 .",
    "the acis - i array , comprising four abutted front - illuminated x - ray ccds , covered the entire cloud core and the nir cluster of mon r2 .",

    "we used the level 2 data provided by the pipeline processing at the chandra x - ray center . besides , we removed those events due to charged particles and hot and flickering pixels .",
    "the effective exposure time was then @xmath0100  ks .",
    "figure [ fig : acisi ] shows an acis - i image of the entire cloud core and the nir cluster of mon r2 overlaid on a @xmath14co ( @xmath1=1@xmath150 ) intensity map ( loren 1977 ) . for source detection , we used the wavdetect program in the ciao package version 2.2http://asc.harvard.edu / ciao/@xmath16 . ] in the 0.510.0  kev band with a threshold significance of @xmath17 and wavelet scales from 1 to 16 pixels in multiples of @xmath18 . in order to study the spectra and timing with reasonable statistics",
    ", we discarded the sources with x - ray counts of less than three - times the background .",
    "we then detected 368 sources in the acis - i fov .",
    "the x - ray photons of each source were accumulated from a circular region with a radius of @xmath19@xmath20 , depending on the point spread function ( psf ) , which is a function of the angular distance from the telescope optical axis .",
    "the background photons were extracted from a source - free circle of @xmath21 in radius .      to search for the nir counterparts of the cxo sources",
    ", we used the point source catalog in the 2mass second incremental data releasehttp://www.ipac.caltech.edu/2mass/@xmath16 . ] , and the results of sqiid and ircam3 observations ( carpenter et  al .",
    "sqiid was mounted at the cassegrain focus of the 1.3  m telescope in the kit peak national observatory , which simultaneously takes @xmath1- , @xmath2- , and @xmath3-band images using 256@xmath22256 ptsi arrays ( ellis et  al .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath23 providing a fov of @xmath24 .",

    "the pixel scale is @xmath27 , providing a fov of @xmath28 .",
    "the observation consisted of 3@xmath223 grid mosaics ; hence , the ircam3 observation presented @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and narrow - band @xmath29 imaging photometry of the central @xmath30 region of mon r2 more deeply than the sqiid observation . the 5  @xmath31 completeness limits in the @xmath3-band images",
    "were 14.5  mag and 16.6  mag for the sqiid and ircam3 observations , respectively ( carpenter et  al .",
    "1997 ) . on the other hand",
    ", 2mass has the @xmath32-band limit of 14.3  mag . because the position accuracy of 2mass ( the r.m.s . uncertainty of @xmath33 ) is better than those of sqiid ( @xmath34 ) and ircam3 ( @xmath35 ) , we used the 2mass frame as the standard frame .",
    "the distribution of the positional differences between sqiid , ircam3 , and 2mass could be approximated by a two - dimensional gaussian in the @xmath36r.a.@xmath36decl .",
    "plane with the center at @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we hence fine - tuned the sqiid and ircam3 frames so that the center of the gaussian would come to the zero position of the 2mass frame .",
    "we picked up the closest nir source from each x - ray source and did vice versa . using the thus - selected closest pairs of nir and x - ray sources , we fine - tuned the acis - i frame by shifting @xmath39 in r.a . and @xmath40 in decl . to match the 2mass frame .",
    "we then searched for the closest pairs of nir and x - ray sources again . among these pairs , we identified counterpart pairs under the criterion that the angular distance between the x - ray and the nir source is smaller than the root mean square of the position uncertainty derived by the wavdetect program and the radius of the psf .    finally , 245 x - ray sources were identified with the nir counterparts in the sqiid and ircam3 databases , and outside of the fov of sqiid , additional 45 x - ray sources were identified with the 2mass sources ( see figure [ fig : ang.sep . ] ) . assuming a random distribution of the nir sources , the chance coincidence that any of the nir sources fall in an x - ray source region is estimated to be @xmath00.6% ; hence , the false identification is expected to be less than two sources .",
    "the fine - tuned source positions , background - subtracted photon counts in the 0.510.0  kev band , and the name of the nir counterparts are given in table 1 .      for bright 126 sources having more than 50 photons after background subtraction ( hereafter  bright sources \" ) , we performed spectral and timing analyses using xspec version 10.0 in xanadu.http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/@xmath16 . ]",
    "the x - ray spectra were fitted by a thin - thermal plasma model with three free parameters : the absorption column density ( @xmath41 ) , plasma temperature ( @xmath42 ) , and normalization .",
    "since the statistics are limited for most sources , the chemical abundance was fixed to be 0.3 solar according to previous reports ( kohno et  al .",
    "2002 ; feigelson et  al .",
    "2002 ; getman et  al .",
    "the best - fit parameters and relevant physical values are listed in table 2 with their 90% errors in parentheses .",
    "the distributions of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 of bright sources are shown with their mean value and that weighed with the errors ( bevington , robinson 1992 ) in figures [ fig : nhdis ] , [ fig : ktdis ] , and [ fig : ludis ] , respectively .",
    "we then made light curves of the bright sources in the 0.510.0 kev band . to study the time variability",
    ", we applied the kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test ( press et  al .",
    "1988 ) ; then , 49 out of 126 sources were found to be time variables with more than 99% confidence .",
    "the significance levels of the time variability are listed in table 2 .",
    "most of the variable sources exhibit a flare - like event with a fast rise and slow decay .",
    "we examined whether or not the detected 368 x - ray sources are cloud members by checking their @xmath41 values and @xmath3-band magnitudes .",
    "the absorption column density of the interstellar medium to mon r2 is estimated to be @xmath02.6@xmath44  @xmath45 , assuming the density of the interstellar medium to be 1  @xmath46 .",
    "since the @xmath41 values of most x - ray sources exceed this value ( figure [ fig : nhdis ] ) , they should be located in or behind the cloud , although the limited photon counts can not give firm constraints .",
    "most of the background galaxies have @xmath3 @xmath47 17  mag ( tsujimoto et  al .",
    "2002 ) , while the @xmath3-band limit of nir sources is 16.6 mag .",
    "we thus suspect that most of the nir identified x - ray sources are cloud members .    for all of the acis sources",
    ", we searched for possible binary systems by checking whether or not two or more nir sources were located within a radius of three - times the psf .",
    "we used 2mass and ircam3 catalogs , which have comparable pixel scales of @xmath48 and @xmath34 compared with that of acis of @xmath49 , and found that only one source , # 151 , has two nir counterparts separated by @xmath50 ( or @xmath0900 au ) .",
    "this separation , however , is one order of magnitude larger than the typical separation of binaries ( giannuzzi 1989 ) ; hence , these two nirs may not be a binary system .      in order to make a comprehensive discussion about x - ray emitting sources in mon r2",
    ", we compared our results with those of previous studies .    in a rosat / pspc observation , gregorio - hetem et al .",
    "( 1998 ) found 23 x - ray point sources in the fov of acis - i .",
    "we searched for acis counterparts within a radius of @xmath51 from each pspc source ( position accuracy @xmath010@xmath52 ) and found seven counterparts .",
    "we also found five additional possible counterparts relaxing the criterion radius to the position error of each pspc source ( table 1 ) .",
    "for the remaining 11 sources , we did not find significant x - rays .",
    "this may have been due to a long - time variability , possibly several years , as can be seen in the sun .",
    "there are some sources that are missing in table 1 , but are listed in kohno et al .",
    "this discrepancy arises from the difference in the source detection algorithm . in kohno",
    "et al . ( 2002 ) , after executing the wavdetect program , they detected 12 additional sources with a visual inspection above the 5 @xmath31 confidence level .",
    "however , in this paper , we did not perform such an inspection , but excluded 34 sources under the criterion that they should have the source- significance level of more than three .",
    "moreover , since we ran the wavdetect only for the total energy band image , some sources detected only in the soft band ( 0.52.0 kev ) or hard band ( 2.010.0 kev ) in kohno et al .",
    "( 2002 ) were missed in this study .",
    "we also compared our results of four intermediate- and high - mass ysos ( a@xmath53 , irs1sw , irs2 , and irs3ne ) with those in kohno et al .",
    "we do not report on x - rays from the position of a@xmath53 , although kohno et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found a counterpart within a @xmath54 radius .",
    "we certainly found an x - ray source at a distance of @xmath55 from a@xmath53 , which is larger than our criterion radius of identification at the position of a@xmath53 of @xmath49 based on the error radius derived by the wavdetect program .",
    "we , hence , do not regard this x - ray source as a counterpart of a@xmath53 .",
    "for irs1sw , irs2 , and irs3ne , we obtained almost the same results as that of kohno et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . based on the positions in the color  color and color  magnitude diagrams ( subsections 4.3 and 4.4 ) ,",
    "irs1sw is classified as a high- or intermediate - mass ctts , and irs2 has a larger @xmath3-band excess than cttss .",
    "because irs3ne is saturated at the @xmath3 band , the reliable @xmath3-band magnitude can not be obtained . however , based on the @xmath1- and @xmath2-band magnitudes , this is classified as a high- or intermediate - mass source .",
    "preibisch et al .",
    "( 2002 ) resolved a multiple irs3 source into three individual ir sources ( irs3a = irs3s , irs3c = irs3ne , and irs3e = cmdsh278 ) by their deep observation using hst / nicmos , and found that all of the sources emit x - rays using the same dataset as ours .",
    "we found five photons at the nir position of irs3s .",
    "however , these photons may not be from irs3 because of severe contamination from the bright source # 207 ( = irs3ne / irs3c ) .",
    "irs3e , which corresponds to # 202 , is classified as a low - mass ctts , as also shown in figure 2 in preibisch et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "we classified the 247 x - ray sources that have @xmath1- , @xmath2- , and @xmath3-band counterparts ( hereafter `` nir - bright sources '' ) into ctts and wtts by the following criterion . using the nir data",
    ", we made the @xmath56 color  color diagram shown in figure [ fig : colcol ] , where the colors were transformed into the cit ( california institute of technology ) system ( bessel , brett 1988 ) with a formula given by carpenter ( 2001 ) .",
    "the thin solid curves are the intrinsic colors of giant and dwarf stars ( tokunaga 2000 ) , while the de - reddened locus ( thick solid line ) for cttss was taken from meyer et  al .",
    "we assumed the slope of the reddening line to be @xmath57= 1.63 ( martin , whittet 1990 ) , as given by the dashed lines . since cttss are surrounded by cold accretion disks , they generally have larger @xmath3-values than wttss .",
    "therefore , we regard the sources located between the middle and the right reddening lines and above the ctts locus as cttss , while sources located between the left and middle reddening lines are regarded as wttss .",
    "we obtained 57 and 164 sources with this classification .",
    "the remaining 26 sources located in other regions could not be classified .",
    "the expected errors in the classification are presented by meyer et al .",
    "they concluded that approximately 1/3 of the cttss would occupy the region of the wttss .",
    "however , in this paper , we use the terms  cttss \" and  wttss \" for plainness .    excluding the unclassified sources , the number of bright sources and the averaged x - ray properties in each evolutionary phase are listed in table 3 .",
    "we can see a higher @xmath42 for cttss ( 3.1 kev ) than wttss ( 1.9 kev ) .",
    "however , there should be a selection bias in favor of a less - absorbed wtts .",
    "then , we also derived the averaged @xmath42 for the sources that had a @xmath41 value less than 10@xmath58 @xmath45 .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath42 of cttss ( 2.4 kev ) is still slightly higher than that of wttss ( 2.0 kev ) .",
    "the confidence level of the difference between the two distributions of @xmath42 is estimated to be 87.6% using the asurv statistical software package ( ver.1.2).http://www.astro.psu.edu / statcodes/@xmath16 . ] in order to examine this feature for other sfrs , we performed the same analysis using the published cxo catalogs of the orion nebula cluster ( hereafter onc , feigelson et  al .",
    "2002 ) and the orion molecular cloud-2/3 ( hereafter omc-2/3 , tsujimoto et  al .",
    "2002 ) , other sites of high- and intermediate - mass star formation . in identifying the 2mass counterpart of x - ray sources in onc , we defined the criterion that the angular separation of x - ray and nir pairs is smaller than the solid line in figure [ fig : ang.sep .",
    "] , which is the envelope curve of the source identification criterion for mon r2 . for omc-2/3 , we used sources that were already identified with 2mass sources by tsujimoto et  al .",
    "we then classified the sources with the same criterion as applied for mon r2 and compared the mean x - ray temperature for each group , as shown in table 3 .",
    "we again confirmed that the results similar to mon r2 ; @xmath42 of cttss is slightly higher than that of wttss .",
    "the confidence levels of difference between the two distributions of @xmath42 are @xmath59  99.9% and 46.2% , respectively .",
    "although the significance level is not high enough , except for onc , we concluded that there is a marginal trend that @xmath42 of cttss is higher than that of wttss for all of the clouds ( mon r2 , onc , and omc-2/3 ) .",
    "this fact indicates that there is some changes between cttss and wttss in a physical process for the x - ray emission . in the case of yso flares ,",

    ", we can not discuss the flare and quiescent phases separately because of the limited photon counts .",
    "future observations with a deep exposure time will reveal whether a similar effect can also be seen in mon r2 .",
    "we divided the nir - bright sources into two mass ranges , defined as @xmath61 ( high- and intermediate - mass ) , and @xmath62 ( low - mass ) by the following criterion . in the @xmath63 color",

    "we assumed the slope of the reddening line to be @xmath662.26 ( martin , whittet 1990 ) .",
    "we regard the sources located above the reddening line of stars with the mass of @xmath67 ( dashed line ) and rightward from the isochrone curve ( solid curve ) as high- and intermediate - mass sources , while sources below the reddening line and rightward from the isochrone curve to be low - mass sources .",
    "we then classified 10 and 230 sources into high- and intermediate - mass sources , and low - mass sources , respectively .",
    "the seven sources located leftward of the isochrone curve could not be classified .",
    "excluding the seven unclassified sources , the number of bright sources and the averaged x - ray properties of each mass range are given in table 4 .",
    "the @xmath68 value for the low - mass sources are significantly smaller than that of the high- and intermediate - mass sources .",
    "this tendency may be due to the bias effect ; the low - mass sources with large absorption come more easily below the detection limit compared to those of the high- and intermediate - mass sources , because the former has a systematically lower @xmath43 than the latter ( kohno et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "since we found a high @xmath42 ( 2.7 kev ) of the high- and intermediate - mass sources similar to that of the low - mass sources ( 2.0 kev ) , we also performed the same analysis for onc and omc-2/3 , and found similar results to mon r2 ( table 4 ) .",
    "moreover , a significant fraction of the high- and intermediate - mass sources show a rapid time variability .",
    "these results indicate that the x - ray emitting process of high- and intermediate - mass ysos is the same as that of the low - mass sources , i.e. , magnetic activity ( kohno et al .",
    "2002 ; preibisch et al .",
    "because high- and intermediate - mass ysos lack surface convection layers ( palla , stahler 1993 ) , the convective dynamo process may not work .",
    "what kind of the magnetic amplification mechanism is working in high- and intermediate - mass ysos is still an open question .",
    "the spatial distribution of x - ray sources in mon r2 seems to be elongated in the same direction as the @xmath14co intensity structure , from north to south ( figure [ fig : acisi ] ) .",

    "we defined two source groups : those detected by x - rays and nir .",
    "we set the @xmath70- and @xmath71-axis along the edge of the acis - i fov , and calculated @xmath69 for each source group separately .",
    "we then obtained @xmath69 = @xmath150.19 and @xmath150.04 for the x - ray detected group and the nir - detected group , respectively . in order to estimate the significance level",

    "we then estimated the significance levels to be 3.7 @xmath31 and 1.3 @xmath31 , for the x - ray and nir sources , respectively .",
    "we also derived @xmath69 for sources that are detected by nir , but not by x - ray , and obtained @xmath69 = @xmath150.03 , the significance level of which is 1.0 @xmath31 .",
    "considering the significance levels , the distribution of the x - ray sources has a more elongated structure than that of nir .",
    "this supports the observational review of feigelson and montmerle ( 1999 ) asserting that x - rays are a homogeneous tracer of all stages of ysos , while the x - ray emission decreases as sources are approaching to the main - sequence stage .",
    "we confirmed this fact quantitatively for the first time by comparing the spatial distribution of x - ray sources and nir sources .",
