    "in this paper we provide examples of non - hyperbolic transitive sets , that we call _ porcupine - like horseshoes _ or , briefly , _ porcupines _ , that show a rich dynamics although they admit a quite simple formulation .",
    "their dynamics are conjugate to skew - products over a shift whose fiber dynamics are given by genuinely non - contracting iterated function systems ( ifs ) on the unit interval .    naively , from a topological point of view , a porcupine is a transitive set that looks like a horseshoe with infinitely many spines attached at various levels and in a dense way . in terms of its hyperbolic - like structure ,",
    "it is a partially hyperbolic set with a one - dimensional center , whose spectrum of central lyapunov exponents contains an interval with negative and positive values which , in particular , illustrates that the porcupine is non - hyperbolic .",
    "although the dynamics on the porcupine is transitive , its spectrum of central exponents has a gap and thus gives rise to a first order phase transition .",
    "our goal is to present these examples and to explore their dynamical properties .",
    "we are not aiming for the most general setting possible , but instead want to present the ideas behind our constructions .",
    "we think that these examples are representative providing models for a number of key properties of non - hyperbolic dynamics .",
    "the analysis in this paper is essentially built on properties of a certain class of non - contracting iterated function systems associated to the central dynamics of the porcupine .",

    "thus , in particular , the spectrum of the lyapunov exponents of @xmath34 contains only the two values @xmath35 and @xmath36 . however , we point out that in our case the breaking of hyperbolicity and the spectral gap are not caused by any critical behavior . note also that in our case the spectrum is richer and contains a continuum with positive and negative values . in our case , the cycle condition and the fact that @xmath10 is orientation reversing allows transitivity . however , typical orbits only slowly approach the cycle points @xmath37 ( which corresponds to the critical point ) and @xmath7 ( which corresponds to the post - critical point ) giving rise to some transient behavior and hence to the gap in the spectrum",
    ".    it would be interesting to find other representative examples that show a gap in the lyapunov spectrum and hence indicating the presence of a first order phase transitions ( the associated pressure function is not differentiable , see proposition  [ p.phasetrans ] ) .",
    "we believe that this point deserves special attention . a collection of examples that present phase transitions are provided in  @xcite in the case of interval maps and  @xcite for abstract shift spaces .",
    "we now put the above abstract results into the framework of local diffeomorphisms and return to the analysis of porcupines .",
    "the porcupines considered in this paper are in fact homoclinic classes ( see definitions  [ def : porc ] and  [ def : homcla ] ) that contain infinitely many saddles of different _ indices _ ( dimension of the unstable direction ) scattered throughout the class preventing hyperbolicity .",
    "moreover , they exhibit a rich topological structure in their fibers ( which are tangent to the central direction ) : there are uncountably many fibers whose intersections with the porcupine are continua and infinitely many fibers whose intersections with the porcupine are just points .",
    "further , the spectrum of the central lyapunov exponents of these sets has a gap and contains an interval ( containing positive and negative values ) .",
    "these properties will be stated in theorem  [ t.bonyexample ] that is a higher - dimensional version of theorem  [ theorem0 ] for local diffeomorphisms .",
    "we point out that porcupines also have strong indications to show a lot of genuinely non - hyperbolic properties that will be explored elsewhere .",
    "for example , the transitive porcupines that we construct do not possess the shadowing property and , following constructions in  @xcite , one can show that they carry non - hyperbolic ergodic measures with large supports and , in view of  @xcite , we expect that they also display robust heterodimensional cycles .",
    "let us point out some further motivation .",
    "ilyashenko in his lecture  @xcite presented topological examples of fibered systems over a shift map that possess recurrent sets ( that he calls _ bony sets _ ) containing some fibers .",
    "the transitive porcupines provide examples of smooth realizations of such systems .",
    "kudryashov  @xcite obtained recently a quite general open class of smooth skew - product systems which exhibit bony attractors .",
    "our examples are also motivated by the construction in  @xcite of bifurcating homoclinic classes and the subsequent study of their lyapunov spectrum in  @xcite .",
    "these sets show indeed porcupine - like features but are `` essentially hyperbolic '' in the sense that all their ergodic measures are hyperbolic .",
    "let us now point out two topological properties of our examples ( in fact also present in  @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "the porcupine is the homoclinic class @xmath38 of a saddle @xmath39 that contains two fixed points @xmath40 and @xmath41 of different indices that are related by a heterodimensional cycle ( see definition  [ def : hetcyc ] ) , 2 .",
    "the saddle @xmath41 has the same index as @xmath39 , but is not homoclinically related to @xmath41 ( compare definition  [ def : homcla ] ) .    comparing with the one - dimensional setting in section  [ subsec:1 ] the points @xmath40 and @xmath41 play the role of @xmath37 and @xmath7 , and the heterodimensional cycle corresponds to the cycle property .",
    "our examples are `` essentially non - hyperbolic '' : the porcupines contain infinitely many saddles of different indices .",
    "this property ( and the fact that the porcupine is transitive ) is the main reason for the fact that the central lyapunov spectrum contains an interval with positive and negative values .",
    "we remark that 2 ) is also the main reason for the presence of a gap in the spectrum of the central lyapunov exponents in  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the condition about the saddle @xmath41 in 2 ) is a _ necessary _ condition to obtain such a gap ( see lemma  [ l.homrelspec ] ) . in our example",
    "the spectrum of the lyapunov exponent associated to the central direction contains a continuum with positive and negative values and a separated point .",
    "this is as far as we know the first example with a spectral gap that is essentially non - hyperbolic and is not related to the occurrence of critical points .",
    "we are aware of the fact that sets that display properties 1 ) and 2 ) above are quite specific : by the kupka - smale theorem saddles of generic diffeomorphisms are not related by heterodimensional cycles and after  @xcite property 2 ) is @xmath42 non - generic . but",
    "this clearly does not imply that the classes discussed here are not representative .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that this paper proceeds a systematic study of non - hyperbolic homoclinic classes . besides the above references",
