    "in a recent paper , yang , chen and shi investigated the system of difference equation @xmath11 where @xmath1 is a positive integer with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is an odd number , both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are nonzero real constants , and the initial values @xmath12 @xmath13 are nonzero real numbers .",
    "they have showed in @xcite that all real solutions of the system are eventually periodic with period @xmath14 ( resp .",
    "@xmath15 ) when @xmath16 ( resp .",
    "@xmath17 ) .",
    "further , the authors @xcite characterized the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of when @xmath18 .",
    "their work is actually a generalization of a result seen in @xcite , wherein zban investigated the behavior of the positive solutions of the system of rational difference equations @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a positive integer with @xmath21 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive constants .",
    "zban particularly showed in @xcite that for the case @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath20 , and @xmath9 not dividing @xmath1 , all positive solutions of the system are eventually periodic with period @xmath24 .",

    "@xcite investigated the system for the case where @xmath9 and @xmath1 are positive integers with @xmath25 , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 are positive constants .",
    "they have showed that if @xmath22 , and @xmath1 is divisible by @xmath9 , then every positive solution of is periodic with period @xmath26 . in @xcite , an intriguing result regarding the behavior of positive solutions of the higher - order difference equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 , was obtained by irianin and liu through an elegant and short way .",
    "one particular results they presented in reads as follows : if @xmath30 in and @xmath31 , and @xmath9 is odd , then all positive solutions of are eventually periodic with period @xmath14 .",
    "their result was in fact inspired by earlier results presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similar nonlinear systems of rational difference equations were also investigated , see , e.g. , cinar @xcite , cinar and yalinkaya @xcite , cinar et al .",
    "@xcite , and zban @xcite .",
    "now , our aim in this work is to answer a question raised by yang et al . at the end of their paper @xcite .",
    "particularly , we shall described here the behavior of solutions of in the case when @xmath9 is even .",
    "we mention that yang et al .",
    "@xcite already made a preliminary observation on the behavior of solutions of when @xmath9 is even .",
    "more specifically , they have observed , after some numerical experimentations , that is non - periodic when @xmath9 is even .",
    "here we show , through an analytical approach , that this observation is in fact true whenever @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath1 is odd and that , in addition , every positive solution of when @xmath32 has an exponentially growing / decaying subsequence irrespective of the choice of positive initial values @xmath33 on this case .",
    "every solution , however , will be periodic of period @xmath34 , where @xmath34 denotes the least common multiple of @xmath9 and @xmath26 , if @xmath10 is odd",
    ". on the other hand , if @xmath10 is even , then every solution of behaves in a similar fashion as in the case when @xmath31 .",
    "that is , there is some subsequence of the solution @xmath35 ( resp .",
    "@xmath36 ) which tends to infinity ( resp .",
    "converges to zero ) ( cf .",
    "theorem [ main ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that the problem raised by yang et al . in @xcite",
    "remains open since irianin and liu @xcite only deal with the case when @xmath9 is odd in , which is not of interest here .    by an eventually periodic solution @xmath37 of , we mean that there exist an integer @xmath38 and a positive integer @xmath39 such that @xmath40 and @xmath39 is called a period ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . if , regardless of the choice of initial values @xmath41 , @xmath42 , no such values of @xmath43 and @xmath39 exist , then every solution of is not and can never be periodic .",
    "in this section we show that the system can never have a periodic or eventually periodic solution when @xmath9 is even and @xmath1 is odd . if , however , @xmath1 is even , then the existence of periodic solution of depends on the parity of @xmath10 .",
    "our approach parallels that seen in @xcite .",
    "we only consider the case when @xmath32 in with all of its initial values taken from the set of positive real numbers .",
    "the same inductive lines , however , can be followed to show a similar result for the case @xmath44 and even for the more general case given by system .    to show that has no periodic solution , it suffices to prove that every solution of has an increasing subsequence ( or , perhaps , a decreasing subsequence ) regardless of the choice of initial values @xmath45 , @xmath13 .    with this idea in mind",
    ", we now proceed as follows .",
    "first , we transform the first equation in to @xmath46 since @xmath47 for all @xmath48 , then taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the above equation and making the subtitution @xmath49 , we get @xmath50 using the ansatz @xmath51 , we obtain the polynomial equation @xmath52 from here on , we consider two possibilities : ( i ) @xmath31 ; and ( ii ) @xmath53 .",
    "+ : suppose that @xmath31 or equivalently , @xmath1 is odd .",
    "then , it is evident that @xmath54 is a root of @xmath55 of order two .",
    "denote this repeated root by @xmath56 and @xmath57 , i.e. , let @xmath58 . then",
    ", the explicit formula for the sequence @xmath59 is of the form @xmath60 for some real numbers @xmath61 .",
    "note that @xmath55 has all of its roots on the unit disk @xmath62 .",
    "denote these roots by @xmath63 where @xmath64 are the corresponding roots of @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the roots of @xmath67 . clearly , @xmath68 for all @xmath69 and @xmath70 for all @xmath71 . since @xmath3 , then @xmath72 for all @xmath73 .",
    "hence , @xmath74 suppose @xmath75 , then for sufficiently large @xmath76 , @xmath77 will eventually be increasing for @xmath78 , in fact we ll have @xmath79 going back to the relation @xmath80 , we see that @xmath81 moreover , we have @xmath82 therefore , the subsequence @xmath83 ( resp .",
    "@xmath84 ) will tend to infinity ( resp .",
    "converges to zero ) exponentially .",
    "thus , every solution of can never be periodic when @xmath31 , or equivalently , when @xmath1 is odd .",
    "+ : now , the case @xmath53 needs a little more work .",
    "suppose @xmath85 for some odd integer @xmath86 and integer @xmath87 .",
    "then , the roots of @xmath55 can be expressed as @xmath88 \\ \\exp\\left\\ { \\dfrac{2l \\pi i}{p}\\right\\ } , & l=0,1,\\ldots , p-1 .",
    "\\end{cases}\\ ] ]    let @xmath89 and @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "the roots of @xmath55 are simple if and only if @xmath93 or equivalently @xmath94 we consider two separate subcases , namely : ( a ) @xmath10 is odd ; and ( b ) @xmath10 is even .",
    "+ : clearly , if @xmath95 is odd ( i.e. , @xmath10 is odd ) , then the inequality always holds .",
    "hence , the roots of are distinct . moreover",
    ", since @xmath96 , then the explicit formula for @xmath97 takes the form @xmath98 for each @xmath99 , where @xmath100 denotes the least common multiple ( lcm ) of @xmath9 and @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , @xmath101 is eventually periodic with period @xmath34 . since @xmath80 for all @xmath102 , then @xmath103 , as well as @xmath104 , are also eventually periodic .",
    "+ : now , if @xmath10 is even ( i.e. , @xmath105 for some integers @xmath106 with @xmath107 being odd ) , then @xmath108 must be odd , otherwise @xmath109 .",
    "evidently , does not hold since the equality @xmath110 may hold true by choosing appropriate values for @xmath111 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath112 , then we can choose @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "in general , we can take @xmath115 and @xmath114 .",
    "since the inequality was not satisfied , then @xmath55 has at least one repeated root . without loss of generality , let @xmath116 be a root of @xmath55 of order two and @xmath34 be the least common multiple of @xmath9 and @xmath26 . by arguing as in the first case",
    ", we see that the subsequence @xmath117 again , going back to the relation @xmath80 , the above result leads us to conclude that when @xmath53 and @xmath10 is even , a subsequence of the solution to grows / decays exponentially . thus , every solution in this case is non - periodic .",
    "+ we remark that every solution to when @xmath44 has the same behavior as those in the case when @xmath32 .",
    "the only difference is that every real solution of for @xmath44 oscillates at @xmath118 .",
    "this can be seen easily from the relation @xmath119 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath120 is a solution to with positive initial values , then there is some subsequence @xmath121 ( resp .",
    "@xmath122 ) which tends to infinity ( resp .",
    "converges to zero ) exponentially .",
    "+ we summarize our discussion in the following theorem for the case @xmath32 .",
    "a similar conclusion can be established for @xmath44 .    [",
    "main ] let @xmath120 be a solution to . then",
    ", the the following statements are true :    1 .   if @xmath31 , then the solution @xmath120 of system has a subsequence @xmath83 ( _ resp . _",
    "@xmath84 ) that tends to infinity ( _ resp .",
    "converges to zero _ ) exponentially , and vice versa .",
    "2 .   if @xmath53 , and @xmath10 is odd , then the solution @xmath120 of system is eventually periodic with period @xmath34 , where @xmath34 denotes the least common multiple of @xmath9 and @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath53 and @xmath10 is even , then the solution @xmath120 behaves in a similar fashion as in ( i ) .",
    "some illustrations which shows different behaviors of various solutions of system for the case @xmath32 with random positive initial values are illustrated in figures ( 1)(5 ) .",
    "[ fig1 ]    [ fig2 ]    [ fig3 ]    [ fig4 ]    [ fig5 ]    we remark that a similar system has been studied by zban in @xcite wherein he investigated the behavior of positive solutions of the system @xmath123 where @xmath124 is a nonnegative integer and @xmath34 is a positive integer .",
    "his main result states that all solutions of the above system of difference equations are periodic with period @xmath125 . in particular , when @xmath32 and @xmath126 , all solutions of above equation is periodic with period @xmath127 .",
    "in this short note , we have investigated the behavior of positive solutions of the system @xmath0 for @xmath32 , where @xmath1 is a positive integer with @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 is an even number .",
    "we have found that every solution of the above system when @xmath32 , with @xmath128 , is non - periodic and has a subsequence that grows / decays exponentially whenever @xmath1 is odd .",
    "however , a periodic solution of the given system occurs when @xmath53 and @xmath10 is odd . in this case , the period of the solution appears to be equal to the least common multiple of @xmath9 and @xmath26 . on the other hand , a similar behavior as for the case when @xmath1 is odd",
    "was observed when @xmath53 and @xmath10 is even .",
    "consequently , our result settled the question raised by yang et al . in @xcite about the behavior of solution of the given equation on the case when @xmath9 is even and @xmath129 in the given system .",
    "from the polynomial equation @xmath130 , it is clear that @xmath131 is a simple root .",
    "hence , a particular solution to the non - homogeneous equation @xmath132 has the form @xmath133 from which , by simple computation , leads to @xmath134 .",
    "thus , if @xmath53 and @xmath10 is odd , then the general solution of equation takes the form @xmath135 we can write @xmath103 as @xmath136 , where @xmath137 denotes the positive solution of equation with @xmath30 .",
