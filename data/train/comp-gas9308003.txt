    "why is violation of detailed or semi - detailed balance @xcite of interest , and what are its consequences ? in the context of lattice gas automata violation of the stueckelberg condition has been used to increase the reynolds number in hydrodynamic flows @xcite and to model the dynamics of phase separation and spatial instabilities @xcite .",

    "as soon as detailed balance is lacking , there does not exist an h - theorem . in the thermodynamic limit the system may or may not approach a unique stable spatially uniform equilibrium state . in the latter case the system seems to build up spatial correlations of ever - increasing range @xcite ; in the former case there exist strong velocity correlations at equal times @xcite .",

    "we are particularly interested in spatial instabilities , that lead to phase separation and formation of spatial patterns .",
    "the main goal is to show how a linear stability analysis or study of the long wavelength hydrodynamic and diffusive modes determines the stability thresholds ( temperature , range of forces ) , the initial patterns , i.e. wavelength and direction of maximum growth , and the onset time of spatial instabilities .",
    "the coarsening of the initial patterns , the growth of correlation length and the scaling laws describing the late stages of phase separation can not be explained on the basis of this linear theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the lattice boltzmann equation , the decay or growth of respectively stable or unstable spatial fluctuations , and the cahn - hilliard theory .",
    "section 3 presents various mechanisms for phase separation in lattice gas automata : thermodynamic instabilities , unstable propagating modes and fluctuating bias fields . in section 4 the discussion",
    "is extended to instabilities in systems where the spatial symmetry is externally broken by an applied field , i.e.  driven diffusive systems , or by an imposed uniform flow velocity .",
    "starting from the nonlinear boltzmann equation for lattice gas automata with local and nonlocal collision rules , we investigate the linear stability of long wavelength fluctuations around the spatially uniform state .",

    "a negative bulk viscosity by itself is not a sufficient condition for instability , as can be concluded from the work of bussemaker and ernst [ 1992 ] , where several stable lattice gases with the characteristics of fig .",
    "2 have been simulated .",
    "the sound modes only become unstable if the sound damping constant @xmath108 becomes negative , i.e. if in addition @xmath53 is sufficiently small .",

    "the normalization is fixed by the condition @xmath127 .",
    "the bias factor represents the effect of a local bias field @xmath128 , which is here a color gradient , that depends on the configurations @xmath129 of all nearest neighbor nodes .",
    "it further contains the color flux @xmath130 in the post - collision configuration @xmath131 .",
    "the quantity @xmath132 represents the amount of work done on the system by sending particles up a color gradient .",

    "at very high temperature ( @xmath137 ) there is no bias ; at very low temperature ( @xmath138 ) there is a strong bias .",
    "there is a threshold value @xmath62 below which the color diffusion mode is unstable .",
    "the order parameter is the difference in concentration of red and yellow particles .",
    "similar fluctuating bias fields are present in the _ negative viscosity _ model of rothman [ 1989 ] .",
    "the fluctuating bias field is the gradient of the local flow field and the flux is the momentum flux .",
    "this model leads to spontaneous ordering in the velocity field with regions of high vorticity .",
    "the order parameter is the transverse momentum density or vorticity .",
    "a further simplification of the rothman - keller model is the _ negative diffusion _",

    "we need to caution the reader here , because it is not at all clear whether the forces driving the kinetics of phase separation in diffusive systems or the kinetics of ordering of the flow field in regions of high vorticity , can be sensibly modeled by sending fluxes upstream against the prevailing gradients ( negative transport coefficients ) . according to irreversible thermodynamics fluxes are downstream , transport coefficients are positive , as is the irreversible entropy production .",
    "these questions need further clarification .    here",
    "we will only illustrate some of the dramatic effects , such as pattern formation , that results from negative transport coefficients induced by fluctuating bias fields .",
    "as an illustration we discuss the negative diffusion model and apply the linear stability analysis of section 2 .",

    "the maxima are located in the @xmath150-direction , a typical distance @xmath151 away from the origin .",
    "as @xmath61 is further decreased below threshold , the typical wavelength @xmath152 of the most unstable excitation decreases .",
    "the threshold value follows directly from the small-@xmath153 expansion of ( [ b4 ] ) , yielding @xmath154 . for @xmath155 ( which corresponds to @xmath156 according to bussemaker and ernst [ 1993c ] )",
    "the diffusion coefficient takes a negative value , and the system becomes unstable for long wavelength fluctuations .",
    "the mean field value found for the threshold @xmath157 is about 20% higher than the threshold measured in the computer simulations of alexander et al .",
    "[ 1992 ] .",
    "according to the cahn - hilliard theory we can use ( [ a7 ] ) and ( [ a8 ] ) to calculate the initial structure and patterns in the density - density correlation function @xmath79 .",
    "this yields the checkerboard pattern of fig .",
    "3b with a typical lattice distance @xmath76 .",
    "we have also carried out computer simulations of the structure function and its inverse @xmath158 for a @xmath159 system prepared in a random initial state at @xmath160 .",
    "quantitative comparison with the cahn - hilliard prediction of @xmath79 is complicated by the 20% discrepancy in the threshold temperature , mentioned in the preceding paragraph .",
    "3c shows @xmath79 at @xmath161 , obtained from a simulation at @xmath162 , a value which is just below the _ simulation _ value of the threshold temperature @xmath1633.05 - 3.10 reported by alexander et al .",
    "one sees that the structure of @xmath79 in the actual simulations is qualitatively the same as in the cahn - hillard theory , although the typical length scale is about 30% smaller .",
    "if the spatial symmetry of the underlying lattice is broken by an external driving field or by a spatially uniform flow , the @xmath60-regions of the most unstable excitations become strongly anisotropic , and different types of striped phases may appear .",
    "the occurrence of striped phases in driven diffusive systems is well known @xcite .",
    "they have also been observed in computer simulations of the negative diffusion model , where an external field @xmath164 is added , that drives a particle current @xcite .",
    "the driving force in lattice gases can be implemented by replacing the bias factor in section 3.3 by @xmath165 $ ] .    in our analysis",
    "we restrict ourselves to the linear response regime , where the particle current satisfies the constitutive relation , @xmath166 with @xmath167 the mobility and @xmath168 the diffusion coefficient .",
    "both transport coefficients are related by the einstein relation @xmath169 .",
    "for sufficiently high temperature @xmath61 there exists a stable spatially uniform state .",
    "its distribution function @xmath170 can be obtained by numerically solving ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "the velocity distribution is anisotropic due to the presence of the field . as @xmath61",
    "is decreased the density fluctuations of long wavelength become again unstable .",
    "the stability analysis of section 2 is performed by linearizing ( [ a1 ] ) around @xmath170 , and determining when and where the eigenvalue @xmath171 becomes negative .",
    "as the spatial symmetry is broken the threshold of stability @xmath172 depends not only on the field @xmath164 but also on the direction of @xmath60 .",
    "a systematic analysis of the @xmath60-regions of instability as a function of @xmath61 will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we only illustrate the occurrence of striped patterns for a typical case with @xmath164 in the @xmath173-direction . at @xmath174",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath148 only shows unstable modes if @xmath60 is perpendicular to @xmath164 , with peaks at @xmath175 .",

    "alexander et al .  [ 1992 ] mention that `` there also appears to be a second transition at a lower temperature to a phase with structures resembling those found for @xmath176 '' .",
    "our analysis suggests that this transition is very gradual : as the temperature decreases further below @xmath62 , the region of unstable @xmath177-directions spreads out , until at some temperature all directions have become unstable ( fig .",
    "of course for very low temperatures the influence of @xmath178 becomes negligible , since the term @xmath179 then dominates the bias factor .      in computer simulations on fchc lattice gases hnon [ 1992 ] has observed that an initially uniform flow is unstable .",
