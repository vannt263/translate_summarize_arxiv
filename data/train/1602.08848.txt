    "the thermodynamic metric has been studied for decades . first concept was brought by weinhold @xcite , who regarded the hessian of internal energy as a mretic of quilibrium states .",
    "then there was the ruppeiner metric @xcite given by the negative hessian of entropy with respect to conserved charges .",
    "it was shown that the weinhold and ruppeiner are conformally equivalent to each other @xcite .",
    "quevedo suggested a legendre invaraint form of metric in the formalism of geometrothermodynamics@xcite and hendi et al @xcite proposed another new metric such that divergence of ricci scalar coincides with phase transition points .    for the black hole with single charge , such as the schwarzschild black hole , the charge has to be its adm mass @xmath0 and represents the internal energy of the system . according to the first law of thermodynamics",
    ", its mass can be expressed as a function of the bekenstein - hawking entropy @xmath1 , say @xmath2 , which is a monotonically increasing function of single varaible and @xmath1 could be seemed as a reparametrization of a one - dimensional curve for @xmath3 .",
    "the thermodynamic metric , of course , is trivial for such a one - dimensional space .",
    "however , a theory of quantum gravity is expected to generate a ultraviolate ( uv ) scale , denoting @xmath4 , to prevent the catastrophe of infinite temperature predicted by the schwarzschild metric at its final stage .",
    "although satisfactory theory of quantum gravity is still unavailable , it may be still possible to construct an effective theory consistent with the general relativiry ( gr ) but with the desired uv scale .",
    "this effective theory should correspond to a modified schwarzschild metric and one may assign a one - parameter deformation function @xmath5 , where deformation parameter @xmath6 is determined by the desired uv scale @xmath4 .",
    "if we regard @xmath6 to be a new degree of freedom , meaning that scale @xmath4 is allowed to run freely , we obtain an energy function of two variables instead , say @xmath7 . in this way",
    ", we may have a nontrivial two - dimensional thermodynamic metric and the modified schwarzschild - like solution is just the submanifold after a specific @xmath6 is chosen . as an analogy to the gauge theory , one may regard this two - dimensional thermodynamic metric offshell and the onshell effective theory is obtained by gauge fixing @xmath6 . in this letter",
    "we will focus on four different effective theories : the schwarzschild solution with a running newton s gravitational constant @xcite , the regular schwarzschild - like black hole with a uv cutoff @xcite , the noncommutative geometry inspried schwarzschild black hole @xcite , and the schwarzschild black hole with a nonextensive tsallis entropy@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the section ii , we studied various thermodynamic metric for the schwarzschild black hole with a running newton s gravitational constant @xmath8 .",
    "we found it give vanishing ricci scalar if one simply regards @xmath8 as a free parameter . in stead , if one regarded the uv scale on which @xmath8 depends as the new degree of freedom , then nontrivial ricci scalar can be obtained . in the section iii , we studied various thermodynamic metric for the regular schwarzschild - like black hole and regarded the uv length scale as the free parameter .",
    "zeros of heat capacities and poles in the ricci scalars in each thermodynamic metric were computed and compared . in the limit of ordinary schwarzschild black hole , most ricci scalars are found inversely proportional to the entropy to some power . in the section iv , we studied various thermodynamic metric for the noncommutative geometry inspired schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we computed and compared the zeros and spikes in the heat capacities with the poles and spikes in the ricci scalars .",
    "the heat capacities bahave like the ordinary schwarzschild black hole for large entropy , while the ricci scalar was found inversely proportional to the noncommutative parameter at the extremal limit where the hawking temperature vanishes . in the section",
    "v , we studied various thermodynamic metric for the schwarzschild black hole but with the tsallis - rnyi entropy . while the thermal ricci scalars in the ruppeiner and weinhold behaved similarly as those in the running newton constant , they behaved very differently in the hpem metric .",
    "we summarize our result in the section vi .",
    "we first regard the newton s gravitational constant @xmath8 as a free parameter and the bekenstein - hawking entropy as a function of both @xmath8 and mass @xmath0 , that is @xmath9 the idea of time - varying @xmath8 was started long ago by dirac to explain the coincidence between two large dimensionless numbers of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it appeared later in the weinberg s asymptotic saftey for quantum gravity , which is based on the assumption that there exists a nontrivial fixed point for the renormalization group flow of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "now we compute the ruppeiner metric , which is given by he negative hessians of the entropy function ( [ eqn : entropy_function ] ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the differential @xmath13 .",
    "it can be shown that ruppeiner metric is flat .",
    "now we rewrite the adm mass as a function of entropy and newton constant , that is @xmath14 which is identified as the internal energy of the black hole .",
    "the hessians of the internal energy gives rise to the weinhold metric : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the differential @xmath17 .",
    "it can be shown that the weinhold metric is also flat .",
    "now we move to the quevedo metric , which is given by@xcite @xmath18 with some conformal factor @xmath19 . in the quevedo metric of case i",
    ", one has the choice @xmath20 or @xmath21 for the case ii .",
    "we remark that there could exist infinite number of legendre - invariant metrics and the above choices were picked up for simplicity .",
    "another new metric proposed by hendi et al @xcite , denoting hpem metric , claimed to remove the unwanted poles in the thermal ricci scalar .",
    "this corresponds to the choice of conformal factor @xmath22 : @xmath23 however , all quevedo and hpem metric are flat and have vanishing ricci scalar .",
    "this seems to imply that there is no thermodynamic interaction . to have a nontrivial ricci scalar",
    ", we assume a toy model for running newton constant@xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the energy scale .",
    "the finite @xmath26 implies a vanishing newton constant at ir and asymptotically uv safe theory of gravity .",
    "now we regard energy scale @xmath25 , instead of @xmath8 , as a free parameter and calculate various thermodynamic metric .",
    "that is , we consider the entropy function @xmath27 for the ruppeiner metric .",
