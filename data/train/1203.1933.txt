    "the standard classification scheme for the explosions of massive stars consists of two different branches : stars retaining their hydrogen envelope at the time of the explosion produce type ii supernovae",
    "( sne  ii ) , whilst those losing it before the explosion produce type ib or ic sne , depending on the strength of he lines in the spectra . in addition ,",
    "some sne  ic , labelled bl - ic , show broad lines in the spectra , signature of a very high kinetic energy / ejected mass ratio . over the past 5 years",
    ", the above scenario has changed dramatically with the discovery of new classes of transients that may originate from different explosion channels .",
    "pair - instability , pulsational pair - instability and magnetar - powered explosions have been suggested to explain the properties of a group of hyper - luminous and slowly evolving transients ( sn  2007bi , @xcite ; sn  2006gy , @xcite ; sn  2010gx , @xcite , @xcite ) , while fall - back on the collapsed remnant , electron - capture and failed - deflagration scenarios have been proposed to explain faint and fast - evolving transients ( e.g. sn  2008 ha , @xcite , @xcite ; sn  2005e , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , some of these events can still be explained if a more _ canonical _ core - collapse scenario but an extended range of physical conditions of the progenitor at the moment of its explosion is invoked ( e.g. sn  2006gy , @xcite ; sn  2007bi , ; sn  2005cz , @xcite ) .",
    "here we present the observations of a stripped - envelope supernova that evolved in an extremely slow fashion , much more slowly than any other _ spectroscopically normal _ core - collapse sn studied in the literature .",
    "sn  2011bm was discovered by the `` la sagra sky survey '' on 2011 april 5 in the galaxy ic 3918=34.90 mag ( radial velocity corrected for in - fall onto virgo of 2799 @xmath3 @xmath4 and a hubble constant of 72 @xmath3 @xmath5 @xmath6 . ) , @xmath7=0.0221 ( from narrow emission lines of the host galaxy ) , @xmath8=0.032 mag ( assuming a similar dust - to - gas ratio in ic  3918 and in the milky way and comparing the equivalent width of the narrow nai  d absorption lines from ic  3918 with that from the milky way ) , @xmath9=0.032 mag @xcite . ]",

    "this is the earliest detection of the supernova , and strongly constrains the explosion to have occurred between 2011 march 23 and march 26 . after announcement",
    ", we immediately started a follow - up campaign in the framework of the ntt european large programme ( elp ) collaboration and we extensively monitored sn  2011bm using the telescopes available to us .",
    "we collected a large amount of data in the optical domain , complemented by near - infrared data , especially useful to investigate the presence of he in the sn ejecta ( cf .",

    "sn  2011bm shows typical velocities , but a slow velocity evolution similar to those of sne 2009jf or 2007gr .    the classification spectrum taken on april 11 ( 18 days after the explosion )",
    "is rather blue ( @xmath18 @xmath0 0.35 mag ) .",
    "such a blue color is unusual for sn  ic spectra at this epoch .",
    "early spectra of sn  2011bm show the classical type ib / c sn features : feii , w , caii and a faint p - cygni absorption at @xmath06100  , usually identified as siii .",
    "a narrow line is visible at @xmath06530 ( @xmath06390 in the host galaxy rest frame ) in the first four spectra ( see fig .  [ fig1]a ; marked with a vertical dotted line ) .",
    "a similar feature was also observed in very early spectra of sn  2007gr up to few days before maximum , and was identified as cii @xmath176580 , with h@xmath19 or hei @xmath176678 as possible alternatives . using the spectrum synthesis code synow / www.nhn.ou.edu/~parrent / synow.html ]",
    ", we confirm that cii is a consistent identification for this feature .",
    "this supports the idea that our 18-day spectrum of sn  2011bm is similar to those of younger , canonical sne ic .",
    "prominent features of hei or h are not detected in the optical domain , and there is no evidence for the hei line at @xmath0 2 micron in our near - infrared sofi spectrum obtained on 2011 may 9 , consistent with the classification as a sn ic .    the best match for the spectra of sn 2011bm is found with those of sn  2007gr , persisting along the whole evolution ( fig .",
    "[ fig2]a and [ fig2]b ) .",
    "what is different , however , is the time scale of the transition from optically thick to optically thin ejecta . at 18 days past core - collapse",
    "the spectrum of sn  2011bm is still blue ( like those of normal type ic sne a few days after the explosion ) .",
    "three months after the explosion sn  2011bm is still optically thick , and the best match is found with spectra of sn  2007gr at a phase of only 1 month .",
    "later on , at 305 days the spectrum of sn  2011bm shows nebular lines , though the detection of [ w ] @xmath175577 is unexpected , as this line usually disappears in the spectra of sne  ic by @xmath0150-200 days after core - collapse .",
    "the spectrum of sn 2007gr at 172 days shows a stronger mgi ] @xmath174571 line than that of sn 2011bm .",
    "this may be due to a lower abundance of magnesium in sn 2011bm than in sn  2007gr or to a different ionisation / excitation state of the ejecta in the two sne or simply to the fact that the o - ne - mg layer is still not completely exposed , while we are still seeing the c / o - rich layer . in the latter case , the mgi ] @xmath174571 line is expected to become more prominent with time .    even more intriguing is the luminosity evolution of sn  2011bm .",
    "after the earliest detection by ps1 , the light curve rises for several weeks , reaching its maximum in the r - band on 2011 may 2 ( jd = 2455684.3 ) , 40 days after the explosion ( see fig . [ fig1]b ) .",
    "no other _ normal _ sn ib / c has shown such a slowly rising light curve . the post - maximum evolution is qualitatively similar to those of other sne  ic , with a more rapid initial luminosity drop followed by a slower decline .",
    "however , for sn  2011bm the inflection points occurs much later than in other sne ic . comparing the light curves of sn  2011bm with those of sne  1998bw ( r band , * ? ? ? * ) and 1997ef ( v band , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which are among the most slowly evolving bl - ic sne available in the literature , we find that sn  2011bm is evolving @xmath01.5 times more slowly than sn  1997ef and @xmath02.2 times more slowly than sn  1998bw .",
    "sn 2011bm also evolves 2.7 times more slowly that sn  2007gr in the r band , in good agreement with the different time scales of the spectral evolution highlighted in fig .",
    "a direct estimate of the host - galaxy metallicity can be obtained from the fluxes of nebular emission lines in the vicinity of the sn location .",
    "we measured the following narrow lines of the host - galaxy detected in our wht spectrum of 2011 december 19 : [ oii ] @xmath203726,3729 , h@xmath21 , [ oiii ] @xmath174959 , [ oiii ] @xmath175007 , h@xmath19 , [ nii ] @xmath176583 .",
    "using different metallicity indicators , we obtain the following values : the n2 index calibration of @xcite gives 12+log(o / h ) = 8.41 dex , while the o3n2 index provided by the same authors gives a value of 8.31 dex . the method adopted by @xcite",
    "( see their eq .",
    "18 ) yields 12+log(o / h ) = 8.58 dex .",
    "these values are only marginally sub - solar . from the h@xmath19 emission",
    "we also estimate a star formation rate of @xmath0 0.06 m@xmath1 @xmath22 that is typical of hii regions and similar to that of other stripped envelope sne @xcite .",
    "our observations of sn  2011bm can be used to understand the physical conditions of the progenitor at the moment of the explosion .",
    "important insights come from the nebular spectra , the shape of the light curve and the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the spectrum obtained on 2011 december 18 ( @xmath0270 days after the explosion ) provides additional information on the progenitor s properties .",
    "the presence of the [ w ] @xmath175577 feature is remarkable : this line is usually visible only up to @xmath0150200 days after the explosion , because it requires a relatively high electron density .",
    "using eq .  2 of @xcite and a temperature of 40004500 k , the flux ratio [ w ] @xmath176300/@xmath175577 of about 2040 , as measured from our tng spectrum , indicates an electron density of @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "the flux of the [ w ] @xmath26 feature measured at 270 days ( @xmath27 erg @xmath28 s@xmath29 ) can also be used to roughly estimate the ejected oxygen mass . using the equation from @xcite that is appropriate for our electron - density and temperature regimes , we obtain an oxygen mass of @xmath30@xmath0510 m@xmath1 . as a comparison",
    ", the oxygen masses obtained with the same method for sne 1990i and 2009jf ( 1.34 m@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are significantly smaller .",
    "also the oxygen mass of sn  1998bw ( @xmath03 m@xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , computed via spectral modelling , is a factor of 2 smaller than that of sn  2011bm .",
    "such a large oxygen mass in the ejecta is expected when the progenitor is either a very massive star ( @xmath23 30 m@xmath1 ) or a lower - mass star formed in a very low metallicity environment .",
    "given the metallicity measurement reported above , it is likely that the progenitor of sn  2011bm must have been very massive . since most explosion models of massive stars predict that the oxygen mass represents 60 to 70@xmath31 of the total ejected mass ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can estimate the total ejected mass to be in the range 717 m@xmath1 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a we show the quasi - bolometric light curve of sn  2011bm obtained by integrating our multi - band ( ubvri ) observations .",
    "we also show the _ uvoir _ bolometric luminosity obtained for the few epochs in which jhk photometry of sn  2011bm is available ( labelled as @xmath32 in fig . [ fig3]a ) and a computed _ uvoir _ bolometric light curve using the fractional nir contribution of sn  2009jf @xcite .",
    "the late - time tail of this light curve is flatter than those of other stripped - envelope sne , but still steeper than of h - rich core - collapse sne powered by @xmath2co decay .",
    "this is a clear indication that the @xmath33-rays produced in the @xmath2co decay are not fully trapped .",
    "however , a larger trapping fraction than in other type ic sne confirms that the ejecta of sn  2011bm are quite massive .",
    "we used the toy model described in @xcite - ray deposition function @xcite . ] to independently estimate the physical conditions at the moment of the explosion .",
    "the @xmath32 bolometric light curve can be reproduced with an explosion of a massive star releasing 7 - 16 foe of kinetic energy in ejecta of 7 - 10 m@xmath1 , 0.6 - 0.7 m@xmath1 of which is synthesized @xmath2ni .",
    "these values are in agreement with those given above .",
    "the nickel mass is surprisingly high , if we consider that sn 2011bm was less luminous than sn 1998bw at maximum .",
    "the extremely slow evolution of the light curve and spectra of sn  2011bm have never been observed in other _",
    "normal _ stripped - envelope sne . despite this , its spectral features are very similar to those observed in typical sne  ic , and much narrower than in broad - lined events . these observables are consistent with the explosion of a very massive star ( with a main - sequence mass of @xmath34 m@xmath1 ) that ejected 717 m@xmath1 of material , 510 m@xmath1 of which is oxygen and 0.60.7 m@xmath1 is @xmath2ni ) . the kinetic energy lies between 7 and 17 foe .",
    "sn 2011bm is the first stripped - envelope sn with such a slow evolution and such peculiar physical parameters .",
    "the intrinsic rareness of these events supports the idea that they arise from very massive stars . to our knowledge , only one other _",
    "normal _ stripped envelope sn has been proposed to come from a similarly massive star ( sn  1984l , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "an alternative , more exotic scenario to explain the luminous and broad light curve of sn  2011bm without invoking exceptionally high @xmath2ni and total ejected masses is that of a magnetar - powered core - collapse sn . in this case",
    "the light curve of sn  2011bm would be dominated by the energy released in the spin - down of a newly formed magnetar .",
    "however , the slope of the late - time light curve of sn  2011bm ( until a phase of 300 days ) is consistent with that expected in a normal radioactively - powered sn , without the need of an additional source as proposed in models of magnetar - driven events @xciteco tail ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another characteristic of a magnetar - powered sn would be a bi - polar geometry of its ejecta @xcite .",
    "evidence of a bi - polar explosion may be found in the profiles of the oxygen lines in nebular spectra .",
    "double - peaked profiles would support the idea of a bi - polar explosion , whereas the absence of a double peak is not sufficient to rule out such an explosion geometry . following the approach of @xcite , we inspected the oxygen feature and , though a weak double peak is marginally visible , it appears consistent with the doublet nature of [ w ] @xmath26 . in conclusion ,",
    "our observations do neither require nor support a magnetar - sn scenario .",
    "instead , the traditional framework of a @xmath2ni - powered core - collapse sn from a very massive star seems to provide a coherent explanation .",
    "this makes sn  2011bm the most massive and @xmath2ni - rich _ normal _",
