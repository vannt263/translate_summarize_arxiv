    "the alpha - element deficiency in sgr dsph corresponds to a shift of the trend by @xmath40.4 dex in [ fe / h ] .",
    "figure  2 also shows that the sgr dsph stars below [ fe / h]@xmath4@xmath11 have alpha enhancements of @xmath40.3 dex , typical of the galactic halo .",
    "it is encouraging that the composition of two of the sgr dsph globular clusters ( m54 and ter  7 ) are consistent with our individual field stars .",
    "the two stars studied by bonifacio et al .",

    "it is interesting that the [ fe / h ] values of our sgr dsph stars ranges from @xmath11.6 to @xmath50.0 dex , which is quite large considering that sgr dsph is a dwarf galaxy .",
    "we note that our target selection was biased , based on approximate metallicities from ibata ( private communication ) , to cover a large range of metallicity and to focus more on stars within 0.5 dex of the solar value , in order to compare our abundance results to the trend of @xmath2/fe in the solar neighborhood .",
    "the trend of oxygen in the sgr dsph stars , shown in figure  3 , is consistent with the @xmath2-element trend of figure  2 . for the oxygen abundances in figure  3",

    "( 2004 ) results for the solar neighborhood stars within 14.5 pc .",
    "the sgr dsph stars show a similar slope of [ o / fe ] with [ fe / h ] for the metal - rich stars , but shifted to lower [ fe / h ] than in the solar neighborhood , with a trend that extends almost 0.2 dex below the solar [ o / fe ] value .",
    "this behavior is roughly similar to the the trend of the other @xmath2-elements above [ fe / h]@xmath4@xmath10.6 .",
    "an alternative description is that the [ o / fe ] trend appears to be shifted by approximately 0.3 dex in [ fe / h ] relative to allende prieto et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "we note that two of our three sgr dsph stars with [ fe / h ] @xmath9@xmath11 show halo - like oxygen enhancements .",
    "the metal - poor sgr dsph star , i-73 , does not appear on figure  3 because its very deficient oxygen abundance ( [ o / fe]=@xmath10.91 dex ) , puts it outside our chosen plot boundary .",
    "the low [ @xmath2/fe ] and [ o / fe ] ratios observed in sgr dsph can be understood in a paradigm , suggested by tinsley ( 1979 ; but see also wheeler , sneden & truran 1989 , and mcwilliam 1997 ) , to explain the trend of decreasing [ o / fe ] with increasing metallicity from @xmath11@xmath9[fe / h]@xmath90 . in this scenario",
    "the low metallicity , halo , stars have high [ @xmath2/fe ] , characteristic of ejecta from core - collapse type  ii sn , because the type  ii sn progenitors are short - lived and are first to eject their material back into the ism .",
    "type  ia sn add to the chemical composition on long time scales , of order one to a few gyr . since type  ia produce low @xmath2/fe material , the composition of stars formed over long time scales show lower [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios . in this paradigm",
    "the [ fe / h ] value at which the [ @xmath2/fe ] begins to decline from the halo ratio depends upon the star formation rate : slowly evolving systems are expected to show the decline in [ @xmath2/fe ] at lower [ fe / h ] , because they do not reach as high [ fe / h ] before the time when type  ia sn begin to contribute significantly to the ism composition .",
    "thus , our observations of [ @xmath2/fe ] and [ o / fe ] indicate that the sgr dsph had a lower star formation rate than the solar neighborhood experienced , and that significant contribution from type  ia sn had occurred over a long timescale .",
    "these results are expected for low - mass galaxies ( e.g. see matteucci & brocato 1990 ) .",

    ", we suspect that its atmospheric composition is contaminated by proton - burning products , often seen in galactic globular clusters ( e.g. kraft el al .",
    "1997 , sneden et al . 2004 ) .",
    "our iron abundance for i-73 , at [ fe / h]=@xmath11.09 , differs significantly from the m54 [ fe / h ] value , of @xmath11.55 , found by brown et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; thus , i-73 is probably not a member of m54 , and is the only known field star showing the o - al anti - correlation .",
    "star i-73 might be a member of m54 if either the brown et al .",
    "( 1999 ) metallicity scale differs from ours , or if m54 possesses a metallicity spread , similar to the galactic globular cluster @xmath3  cen , with star i-73 simply a high - metallicity m54 star .",
    "the main bulk of na and al production occurs during hydrostatic burning phases in massive stars , which end as type  ii sn ( e.g. timmes , woosley , & weaver 1995 ; arnett & thielemann 1985 ; woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",

    "2003 , edvardsson et al .",
    "1993 ) , the [ al / fe ] enhancement in thick disk stars ( reddy et al .",
    "2003 ) , and the [ al / fe ] enhancement in galactic bulge stars ( mcwilliam & rich 2003 ) , are all consistent with these two elements being mildly @xmath2-like , mostly made by type  ii sn .",
    "@xmath10na is produced as a primary product of the carbon - burning shell , although the final yields are metallicity - dependent ( woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "observationally , over the full range of [ fe / h ] observed in the galaxy [ na / fe ] roughly scales with [ fe / h ] ( e.g. pilachowski , sneden & kraft 1996 ; mcwilliam 1997 ) , conflicting with the timmes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) predictions of metallicity - dependence .",
    "the yield of @xmath11al in the carbon - burning shell depends on the metallicity of the star , whereas , in the neon - burning shell weak interactions transform the neutron excess , so that there the @xmath11al yield is not so sensitive to metallicity ( e.g. woosley & weaver 1995 ) .",
    "observations of galactic halo field stars ( e.g. gratton & sneden 1988 ; shetrone 1996 ) show that from [ fe / h]=@xmath11 to @xmath13 the halo field stars have a strongly metallicity - dependent [ al / fe ] ratios , even more sensitive to [ fe / h ] than the theoretical expectations of timmes et al . (",
    "1995 ) .",
    "we interpret the low [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] ratios as most likely the result of a diminished role of type  ii sn nucleosynthesis products in the composition of the metal - rich sgr dsph stars , similar to the conclusion reached from the @xmath2-elements ; although the na and al deficiencies are larger than for the @xmath2-elements .",
    "however , the possibility of metallicity - dependent na and al yields complicates interpretation of the abundances .    in figure  5 ( taken from sm02 )",
    "we show one of the most striking abundance trends present in the sgr dsph stars : the strong enhancement of heavy neutron - capture element abundances with increasing [ fe / h ] ; note that the most metal - rich stars have enhancements up to @xmath4@xmath51 dex above the solar value .",
    "it is significant that the largest neutron - capture enhancements , seen in the most metal - rich sgr dsph stars , show a scatter larger than the estimated abundance uncertainties .",
    "the , normally modest , la  ii lines appear strong in most of our spectra , which consequently required careful abundance analysis , including the treatment of hyperfine splitting ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "it would have been useful to measure barium abundances from the ba  ii lines ; but all those lines were very strong , on the flat portion of the curve of growth , resulting in highly uncertain abundances .",
    "figure  6 shows our abundance results for [ eu / fe ] , based on the eu  ii line at 6645 ; the analysis included appropriate @xmath12 treatment .",
    "the figure also indicates the results for the solar neighborhood [ eu / fe ] ratios from a variety of papers , which demonstrate that the eu overabundances in metal - poor stars follow a trend much like that of the @xmath2-elements .",
    "it is clear that the [ eu / fe ] ratios in the sgr dsph are @xmath40.5 dex higher than in the solar neighborhood , at solar metallicity .",
    "figure  7 shows that the ratio of [ la / eu ] trends toward the s - process value with increasing [ fe / h ] , whilst at low [ fe / h ] the [ la / fe ] ratios resemble more the r - process dominated composition of galactic halo stars .",
    "together , these two figures show that [ eu / fe ] can be enhanced even in s - process dominated material , and that , therefore , it is dangerous to blame the r - process as responsible for heavy - element nucleosynthesis based on [ eu / fe ] alone ; instead , it is necessary to ratio the abundances of two heavy elements which have different sensitivities to the neutron - capture timescale .",
    "it is interesting to plot [ la / eu ] with [ la / h ] , rather than [ fe / h ] , as the indicator of metallicity , as in figure  8 : in this case both axes are related , and it becomes possible to make useful model fits to the data . in figure  8",
    "we show three predictions : the solid line shows the locus of [ la / eu ] versus [ la / h ] when pure s - process , with @xmath13=1.5mb@xmath14 , composition is added to the halo composition , at [ la / h]=@xmath10.8 dex ; clearly this does not fit the observations .",
    "the dashed line shows the locus when pure s - process material is added to material with the halo [ la / eu ] value at [ la / h]=@xmath10.3 dex ; this line gives a very reasonable fit to the data for [ la / h]@xmath0@xmath10.3 dex .",
    "the dot - dashed line shows the locus when 95% s - process plus 5% r - process ratio material is added to the halo composition at [ la / h]=@xmath10.3 dex .",
    "the 95% s - process locus also fits the data reasonably well , but it is clear that a smaller s - process fraction will give unacceptable fits to the data .",
    "the plots make predictions about the [ la / eu ] ratios for stars of higher [ la / h ] , irrespective of [ fe / h ] .",
    "the main conclusion to be drawn from this figure is that a model of chemical evolution in which pure , or nearly pure , s - process material is added beginning at [ la / h]=@xmath10.3",
    "dex can explain those stars with [ la / h]@xmath0@xmath10.3 dex ( corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath0@xmath10.6 dex ) .",
    "figure  9 shows the [ la / y ] abundance ratio with [ fe / h ] .",
    "clearly [ la / y ] increases between the metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath9@xmath11 ) and metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath0@xmath10.6 ) sgr dsph stars ; although the metal - rich stars in our sample appear to show a roughly constant [ la / y ] value , near @xmath50.5 dex .",
    "the metal - poor sgr dsph stars appear halo - like in their [ la / y ] ratios .",
    "we note that bonifacio et al .",
    "( 2000 ) reported [ la / y ] values for their two sgr dsph stars almost 0.5 dex higher than our sample at similar [ fe / h ] .",
    "this difference is due to much lower yttrium abundances for the two bonifacio et al .",
    "( 2000 ) stars , and might be explained if our y  ii lines are blended ; however , we made extensive efforts using spectrum synthesis of the kurucz line list to check that our y  ii lines were , indeed , clean .",
    "we conclude that either unknown blends have equally affected our three y  ii lines , or there is some other unknown systematic effect , perhaps due to @xmath6 values , which resulted in the difference between our y  ii abundances and those of bonifacio et al .",
    "( 2000 ) .",
    "figure  9 is especially important because [ la / y ] gives a measure of the heavy / light s - process ratio ( [ hs / ls ] ) .",
    "this ratio has been shown to be sensitive to the metallicity in agb s - process nucleosynthesis ( e.g. busso , gallino , & wasserburg 1999 ) . at low metallicity",
    "the neutron - to - seed ratio is high in the s - process region , and as a result the seed nuclei capture many more neutrons than would occur at higher metallicity , giving a larger production of the heavier neutron - capture nuclei , like la . in this way one can use the [ hs / ls ] ratio , in this case [ la / y ] , to set approximate constraints on the metallicity of the agb star responsible for the nucleosynthesis .",
    "because the [ la / y ] ratio is enhanced in the metal - rich sgr stars , it would appear that the s - process neutron - capture elements were formed by low - metallicity agb stars .",
    "this means that the s - process enhancements could not have been made by the stars themselves , nor could they have been produced by evolved companions , as seen in the solar neighborhood barium stars .",
    "the agb s - process nucleosynthesis models of busso et al .",
    "( 1999 ) provide a relationship between [ fe / h ] and [ hs / ls ] , which we can use to provide a rough estimate of [ fe / h ] of the agb stars which produced the s - process material present in the metal - rich sgr stars : the bi - valued nature of the relationship suggests that the agb stars had [ fe / h]=@xmath10.6 or [ fe / h]@xmath9@xmath11.4 ; alternatively one could imagine a range of agb [ fe / h ] values , heavily weighted to metal - poor stars with [ fe / h]@xmath9@xmath10.6 dex .",
    "we now turn our attention to the iron - peak elements in sgr dsph : figure  10 shows the trend of [ mn / fe ] in the sgr dsph and the galactic bulge , as reported by mcwilliam et al .",
    "great care was taken to try to put the results for both onto the same system , and to normalize the results for the solar neighborhood taken from published studies . regarding the solar neighborhood trend for [ mn / fe ] : it has has long been known ( e.g. wallerstein 1962 , gratton 1989 ) that [ mn / fe ] declines with [ fe / h ] , down to approximately @xmath10.4 dex near [ fe / h]=@xmath11 .",
    "gratton ( 1989 ) proposed that this trend , being the mirror of the @xmath2-element enhancements over the same metallicity range , might be due to an over - production of mn in type  ia sn ; thus , at early times , when fewer type  ia sn had occurred , the [ mn / fe ] ratios were lower .",
    "an alternative explanation for the low [ mn / fe ] ratios in low metallicity stars comes from the predictions of metallicity - dependent supernova nucleosynthesis yields for mn ( e.g. arnett 1971 , woosley & weaver 1995 ) ; although , these calculations were for type  ii sn nucleosynthesis .    in the gratton scenario of mn synthesis",
    "low mn / fe ratios are associated with enhanced @xmath2/fe ratios .",
    "thus , for the sgr dsph , which as we have shown in figures  2 and 3 , possess deficient @xmath2/fe ratios , we would expect an enhancement in mn / fe .",
    "this is opposite from the observed mn / fe ratios seen in figure  10 , which are lower than the normal trend by @xmath40.2 dex . in the galactic bulge , where stars have been shown to have @xmath2/fe enhancements up to solar [ fe / h ] ( e.g. mcwilliam & rich 1994 )",
    ", gratton s scenario would predict a decrease in [ mn / fe ] ; but as figure  10 shows , this is not the case : the bulge trend is similar to that of the solar neighborhood .",
    "mcwilliam et al . ( 2003 ) suggested that the sensitivity of the mn yields to neutron excess , or metallicity , might be expected to apply to type  ia nucleosynthesis of the iron - peak .",
    "if this is the case , then the low mn / fe ratios seen in the metal - rich sgr dsph stars could be explained if the iron - peak material was synthesized by low - metallicity type  ia sn events",
    ". the normal [ mn / fe ] of the bulge stars would also be explained by a metallicity - dependent yield , despite the @xmath2-element enhancements .",
    "timmes , brown , & truran ( 2003 ) argue that the @xmath15ni yield from sn  ia is modulated by the progenitor metallicity , in the 0.2 to 0.8 m@xmath16 mass shells , as a result of a rapid burn to nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) , and they predict a subsequent metallicity - dependent variation of the peak luminosity .",
    "the same argument indicates that low metallicity ( low neutron excess ) nse would also reduce the yield of the neutron - rich isotopes , such as mn .",
    "we arrive at a picture where both the iron - peak elements and the neutron - capture elements in metal - rich sgr stars have been made by a much more metal - poor population .",
    "mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 2003 ) predicted that if this is the case , then the element ratios of other metallicity - dependent species should be similarly affected ; in particular , the [ cu / fe ] trend in the sgr dsph should be deficient relative to the solar neighborhood , since theoretical predictions ( e.g. woosley & weaver 1995 ) and observations ( e.g. sneden & crocker 1988 , mishenina et al .",
    "2002 , simmerer et al 2003 ) suggest a strongly metallicity - dependent cu yield .    in figure  11",
    "we show the observed [ cu / fe ] versus [ fe / h ] for our 14 sgr dsph red giant stars , as reported by mcwilliam & smecker - hane ( 2004 ) . the abundances are based on the cu i line at 5782 , include appropriate @xmath12 effects , and are normalized to the result obtained from the solar line .",
    "the low metallicity sgr dsph stars have [ cu / fe ] values typical of the galactic halo , whilst [ cu / fe ] is deficient by up to 0.5 dex in the metal - rich sgr stars , with a hint of an increase in [ cu / fe ] for the highest metallicity stars .",
    "note that the abundance for @xmath2  boo suggests that , if anything , systematic errors may require us to lower our [ cu / fe ] ratios for the sgr dsph .",
    "the low [ cu / fe ] ratios seen in figure  11 support the conclusions from the [ mn / fe ] abundance ratios ; namely , that the yields of both these elements are metallicity - dependent , and that in the metal - rich sgr dsph the iron - peak abundances are dominated by the yields from of a much lower metallicity population .",
    "we would now like to produce a scenario for the evolution of the sgr dsph to explain all the observed abundance trends , outlined in the previous section .",
    "the neutron - capture element abundances suggest that metal - poor agb stars played a significant role in the synthesis of the heavy elements .",
    "since agb stars that produce s - process elements are usually of low mass ( typically 1.3 to 3m@xmath16 ) the progenitors are probably long - lived , and we conclude that an old , metal - poor , population dominates the abundances of s - process elements in the younger metal - rich stars .    the low [ @xmath2/fe ] ratios , long time scales inferred by the presence of agb s - process material , and the large spread in ages of sgr dsph stars , inferred from color - magnitude diagrams ( e.g. layden & sarajedini 2000 ) , suggest that type  ia sn contributed significantly to the composition of the younger , metal - rich sgr population .",
    "the low abundances of mn and cu suggest that the iron - peak elements of the metal - rich population were synthesized by low - metallicity supernovae , which must have been dominated by type  ia , since type  ii sn , with progenitors formed from the metal - rich young gas , would have produced normal mn and cu abundances .",
    "the importance of metal - poor type  ia , from old progenitors , in the nucleosynthesis of the metal - rich sgr dsph material is supported by the observed deficiencies of na and al , since these two elements are expected to be under - produced in type  ia sn , and under - produced at low metallicity .",
    "an important question to answer is : how did synthesis products from the old , metal - poor , population come to dominate the composition of the metal - rich stars ? for the injection of metals from an old , metal - poor , population to exceed the injection from young stars it is necessary to have a relatively low star formation rate at late times .",
    "this could occur in at least two ways :    first , through a significant loss of gas from the galaxy over long time scales .",
    "in this situation the initial galactic formation event produced a large number of low mass , low metallicity , stars .",
    "subsequent mass loss , over several gyr , would be expected of a low - mass dwarf galaxy like the sgr dsph , and would leave a small pool of gas to form the , younger , metal - rich population . over this long period of time",
    "the old , low - metallicity , population would inject a large amount of gas , both from the envelopes of expired agb stars , and through ejecta from type  ia sn .",
    "this material could overwhelm the material injected from the younger generations ; thus , the new generations of stars would reflect the synthesis products of the old , metal - poor , stars , as observed .",
    "a second possible scenario is that the sgr dsph experienced chemical enrichment dominated by a powerful burst of star formation , followed by a quiescent period of several gyrs .",
    "thus , after the major burst of star formation the injection of newly synthesized material from type  ia sn and agb stars had time to occur , and could have overwhelmed the new material from young stars formed in the quiescent period .",
    "this second scenario would likely leave a reservoir of gas , which would have to be lost from the galaxy at a later time .",
    "it is likely that a combination of both these scenarios operated in the sgr dsph . to estimate the relative importance of these two scenarios",
    "it would be useful to have an unbiased metallicity function of the entire system .",
    "if the mass - loss scenario dominated we might expect the metallicity function to be biased to low - metallicity stars , while a discrete star - formation burst might lead to a metallicity function dominated by a narrow peak ; but detailed models of the metallicity evolution would be required to distinguish between the two scenarios .",
    "observations of the metallicity function from bellazzini et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found 8 to 30% of sgr dsph stars , depending on location , with [ fe / h]@xmath0@xmath10.7 dex . on the other hand , cole ( 2001 ) suggested that the sgr dsph metallicity is peaked at [ fe / h]@xmath4@xmath10.5@xmath80.2 dex , based on 2mass photometry .",
    "given that extensive mass - loss and , perhaps , star formation bursts are expected for low mass galaxies it should be the case that other , low - mass , galaxies have experienced a chemical evolution history similar to sgr dsph .",
    "thus , we might expect the chemical abundance patterns found in the sgr dsph to be expressed in other low - mass systems .",
    "observational evidence for this comes from two systems : the galactic globular cluster @xmath3  cen , and the fornax dwarf galaxy .",
    "abundance analyses of stars in @xmath3  cen ( e.g. lloyd evans 1983 , smith et al .",
    "2000 ) show that the more metal - rich stars in the cluster show [ la / h ] enhancements of @xmath41 dex , and [ la / y ] enhanced by @xmath40.30.4 dex ; cunha et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found deficient [ cu / fe ] ratios in the metal - rich @xmath3  cen stars by as much as 0.5 dex , relative to the solar neighborhood trend .",
    "these results are remarkably similar to our findings for the sgr dsph , except that @xmath3  cen has a lower average [ fe / h ] , near @xmath11.8 dex .",
    "these abundance similarities , as well as the spread in [ fe / h ] suggest that the two systems share similar chemical evolution histories .",
    "however , @xmath3  cen shows the normal halo enhancement of the alpha elements , and enhancements of na and al , rather than the deficiencies we find in sgr dsph ; thus , there must have been some differences in their evolutionary histories .",
    "this supports the idea that @xmath3  cen is the nucleus of an accreted dwarf galaxy ( e.g. gnedin et al . 2002 ) .",
    "three stars in the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy were analyzed by shetrone et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ; two were metal - poor , and possessed halo - like neutron - capture abundances , but the third star , with [ fe / h]@xmath4@xmath10.7 showed large s - process enhancements , @xmath41 dex .",
    "shetrone et al .",
    "( 2003 ) concluded that the most likely explanation for this star is that it underwent mass transfer in a binary system with an evolved agb star ; although with such a small sample they could not rule out the possibility that the most metal - rich stars in fornax have large s - process enrichment from agb stars , in comparison to the number of r - process sn events .",
    "contrary to shetrone et al .",
    "( 2003 ) our opinion is that the similarity of the s - process enhancements in metal - rich sgr dsph and fornax stars strongly suggest that fornax evolved similar to sgr dsph ."

    "<S> our abundances suggest that the composition of the metal - rich sgr dsph stars is dominated by the ejecta of an old , metal - poor population , including products of agb stars and type  ia supernovae ( sn ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we suggest two scenarios to explain the observations : first , is chemical enrichment over long timescales in a galaxy which has experienced significant mass - loss during its evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the second possibility is that we are seeing the products of chemical enrichment from a system which experienced a large burst of star - formation , followed by a quiescent period of may gyr . </S>",
    "<S> both of these scenarios can lead to the situation where newly synthesized material from agb stars and type  ia sn overwhelms nucleosynthesis products from a minor population of young , metal - rich , stars . </S>",
    "<S> it is likely that both mechanisms operate in the sgr dsph .    </S>",
    "<S> since these conditions should be generally applicable to low - mass systems , we expect to find similar abundance patterns in other dwarf galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by the chemical composition of stars in the galactic globular cluster @xmath3  cen and in the fornax dwarf galaxy , suggesting that both shared a history similar to the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy . </S>"
