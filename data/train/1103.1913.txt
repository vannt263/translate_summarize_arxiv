    "the nw emission is on average 5 times fainter than the bright sw cone , but brighter than the control region at @xmath26 ( @xmath27 significance ) .",
    "beyond @xmath28 , it becomes indistinguishable with the faint emission .",
    "the implication on the nuclear obscuring structure will be discussed later in   [ evidence ] .",
    "a quick examination of the spectrum of the extended emission extracted from a circular region between a radius of @xmath29 and @xmath15 shows the clear presence of strong blended emission lines ( figure  [ conti ] ) , corresponding to the emission lines ( @xmath302  kev ) seen in hetg observations ( ogle et al .",
    "these lines can not be uniquely resolved with the spectral resolution of the acis imaging observation .",

    "the blended emission features seen in the acis spectrum and the corresponding hetg lines are summarized in table  1 ( see   2.2.1 ) .    following paper ii , we created adaptively smoothed images of the ngc 4151 circum - nuclear region using the subpixel resolution data .",
    "we extracted images from the merged data in three spectral bands dominated by emission lines below 2 kev : 0.30.7 kev ( `` soft band '' containing the ovii and oviii emission ) , 0.71.0 kev ( `` medium band '' containing the neix emission ) , and 12 kev ( `` hard band '' ) . figure  [ 3color]a presents a false color composite image of the central @xmath32 ( @xmath53  kpc on a side ) , circum - nuclear region of ngc 4151 , where the soft , medium , and hard band smoothed images are shown in red , green , and blue , respectively .",
    "figure  [ 3color]b zooms in to the central 1 kpc - radius region , emphasizing the bicone emission . for visualization of the faint features , the nuclear region ( see paper ii ) is saturated and excluded from this figure . the x - ray biconical morphology has been described in paper i , and here we focus on the spectral differences .",

    "clumps of 0.30.7 kev ( red ; ovii and oviii ) emission are also seen , some particularly prominent features are seen in the sw cone @xmath34 and @xmath35 from the nucleus .    to further highlight the regions where the strong emission lines arise",
    ", we also extracted the x - ray emission in narrow energy intervals ( 0.530.63 kev ; 0.630.73 kev ; 0.850.95 kev ) to create line strength images .",
    "this is a reasonable approach since the line emission dominates over the weak underlying continuum ( schurch et al .",
    "2004 ) in these narrow bands .",
    "the resulting images are shown in figure  [ lines ] .",
    "the position of the nucleus is indicated with a black cross .",

    "neix emission , while extended along the general p.a . of the large scale extended emission , is bright in the central @xmath36 but becomes fainter quickly at @xmath37 compared to the ovii emission .",
    "we examined similar emission line maps for the weak lines in the 12 kev range ( nex , neix rrc , mgxi ) and found that they are highly concentrated within the inner @xmath36 region .",
    "this is better demonstrated in figure  [ lines]d , where the radial profiles of the line emissions are shown .",
    "spectra and instrument responses were generated using ciao version 4.2 and analyzed with xspec version 12.6 ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "background spectra were taken from a source - free region from the same chip .",
    "spectra were grouped to have at least 20 counts per energy bin to allow @xmath38 fitting . unless otherwise noted , we restricted our modeling to photon energies above 0.3 kev , where the acis calibration is good , and below 2 kev , above which the nuclear continuum dominates @xcite . the 90% confidence interval for a single interesting parameter",
    "is reported for all fitting results .",
    "we first characterize the x - ray spectrum of bright extended emission extracted from the @xmath39 circular region , exploring a phenomenological spectral fitting approach that was broadly adopted in previous studies at ccd resolution ( yang et al .",

    "2000 , smith & wilson 2001 ) .",
    "the `` continuum '' in the acis spectrum ( a combination of true underlying continuum and highly blended weak emission lines ) was described by a smooth bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "we emphasize that the bremsstrahlung emission here should not be assigned any physical origin , whereas the derived line emission should be considered as a lower limit in such an approach .    repeating the technique used to fit the spectrum of the nucleus ( wang et al .",
    "2010 ) , narrow emission lines were then added to the model .",
    "hetg and _ xmm_-newton rgs spectra ( ogle et al . 2000 ; schurch et al .",
    "2004 ; armentrout et al .",
    "2007 ) were used as a guide for the identification of the soft x - ray lines .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the nucleus of ngc 4151 is notoriously complex and variable .",
    "the hard x - ray continuum is dominated by a power law component suppressed by a partially covering absorber and a compton reflection component ( weaver et al .",
    "1994 ; schurch et al .",
    "2004 ; de rosa et al . 2007 ;",
    "wang et al .",
    "2010b ; lubinski et al . 2010 ) , and the absorption consists of both a mildly - ionized `` warm absorber '' and a cold absorber @xcite .",
    "the psf scattered contribution from the nuclear emission is taken into account in the spectral fitting , using the nuclear component fixed at the best fit nuclear spectral model and normalization @xcite scaled to the expected fraction from psf simulations .",
    "the extraction region contains 4.7% of the 0.32 kev nuclear emission due to psf scattering , corresponding to @xmath525% of the extracted counts .",
    "this can be taken as the upper limit of contamination to the extended line emission , as the line emission dominates the nuclear spectrum .",
    "the identified emission line blends are summarized in table  [ tab : extended_flux ] and the spectrum shown in figure  [ 4reg2 ] ( see also figure  [ conti ] ) .",
    "the absorption column required by the fit is consistent with the line - of - sight galactic column towards ngc 4151 ( @xmath40 @xmath41 ; murphy et al .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of the extended emission ( between 130 pc and 2 kpc from the nucleus ) corrected for the galactic absorption is @xmath42 erg s@xmath1 , compared with @xmath43 erg s@xmath1 for the unabsorbed nuclear source ( wang et al .",
    "2010b ) .",
    "however , such a simplified model does not provide constraints on the emission mechanism , and more physically meaningful spectral models are needed .",
    "fitting the data with combinations of absorbed optically - thin thermal emission with solar abundances ( @xmath44 model ; smith et al .",
    "2001 ) was attempted but gave poor results ( reduced @xmath45 ) .",
    "the abundances were then allowed to vary from solar abundance in the apec model using the variable abundance apec model ( vapec ) , in which @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 were left free while other elements were fixed at solar abundance .",
    "when @xmath50 is allowed to vary , the fit generally improves but still is far from satisfactory ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "moreover , the required abundances become unphysically low ( @xmath52 ) as the fit attempts to reproduce a smooth continuum .    to have a self - consistent model , we have made use of the cloudy photoionization modeling code ( ferland et al .",
    "although the resolution of the acis ccd spectrum prevents us from performing line - based diagnostics , e.g. deriving line ratios of the helium - like triplets , spectral fitting with photoionization models still provides useful constraints about the photoionization status ( as in bianchi et al .",

    ", we included all these components , with the ionization parameters and the column densities fixed at these values and the normalizations set free .",
    "in addition , the photoionized emission was absorbed with a line - of - sight column density , @xmath68 .",
    "the fit to the acis spectrum was poor ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "this is not a total surprise , given that these best fit parameters , are optimized for the brightest photoionized material close to the nucleus ( 10@xmath701  pc ; armentrout et al .  2007 ) that dominates the soft x - ray spectrum of ngc 4151 , whereas the emission of interest here arise on the @xmath71130  pc1.5  kpc scale .",
    "when the ( @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) parameters for the photoionized components were set free to vary , we were able to obtain a statistically satisfactory fit ( @xmath72 ) , reproducing the observed acis spectrum of the large scale extended x - ray emission well ( figure  [ phot3 ] ) .",

    "two components , a high ionization phase ( @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) and a low ionization phase ( @xmath76 , @xmath77 ) , are required to produce both the hydrogen - like and helium - like neon and oxygen line emissions .",

    "given the satisfactory spectral fits with photoionized components and lack of clear signatures of collisional ionization in the enlr , how much thermal emission from hot gas may be present in the circum - nuclear region of ngc 4151 ?",

    "<S> this paper is the third in a series in which we present deep chandra acis - s imaging spectroscopy of the seyfert 1 galaxy ngc 4151 , devoted to study its complex circum - nuclear x - ray emission . </S>",
    "<S> emission features in the soft x - ray spectrum of the bright extended emission ( @xmath0 erg s@xmath1 ) at @xmath2 pc ( 2 ) are consistent with blended brighter ovii , oviii , and neix lines seen in the _ chandra _ hetgs and xmm - newton rgs spectra below 2 kev . </S>",
    "<S> we construct emission line images of these features and find good morphological correlations with the narrow line region clouds mapped in [ oiii]@xmath35007 . </S>",
    "<S> self - consistent photoionization models provide good descriptions of the spectra of the large scale emission , as well as resolved structures , supporting the dominant role of nuclear photoionization , although displacement of optical and x - ray features implies a more complex medium . </S>",
    "<S> collisionally ionized emission is estimated to be @xmath412% of the extended emission . </S>",
    "<S> presence of both low and high ionization spectral components and extended emission in the x - ray image perpendicular to the bicone indicates leakage of nuclear ionization , likely filtered through warm absorbers , instead of being blocked by a continuous obscuring torus </S>",
    "<S> . the ratios of [ oiii]/soft x - ray flux are approximately constant ( @xmath515 ) for the 1.5  kpc radius spanned by these measurements , indicating similar relative contributions from the low- and high - ionization gas phases at different radial distances from the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> if the [ oiii ] and x - ray emission arise from a single photoionized medium , this further implies an outflow with a wind - like density profile . </S>",
    "<S> using spatially resolved x - ray features , we estimate that the mass outflow rate in ngc 4151 is @xmath52@xmath6 yr@xmath1 at 130 pc and the kinematic power of the ionized outflow is @xmath7 erg s@xmath1 , approximately @xmath8 of the bolometric luminosity of the active nucleus in ngc 4151 . </S>"
