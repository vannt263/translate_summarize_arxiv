    "studies of cosmological and astrophysical effects of primordial black holes ( pbhs ) are important because they enable one to constrain the spectrum of density fluctuations in the early universe .",
    "if the pbhs form directly from primordial density fluctuations then they provide a sensitive probe of the primordial power spectrum on small scales , @xmath2 . in particular , limits on pbhs production can be used to constrain models of inflation , in which the perturbation amplitudes are relatively large at small and medium scales .    in the simplest case ,",
    "if we assume that the cosmological pbh formation is dominated , approximately , by primordial perturbations of one particular scale ( i.e. , there is some characteristic epoch of the pbh formation ) , we can obtain limits on the initial mass fraction of pbhs , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the pbh and total energy densities , respectively , at the time @xmath6 of the formation .",
    "this fraction can be expressed by the integral @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a probability distribution for density fluctuations entering horizon at @xmath6 , @xmath9 is a density contrast , and @xmath10 is a minimum value of @xmath9 required for the collapse . if the probability distribution is assumed to be gaussian , one has @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the _ rms _ fluctuation amplitude on a given scale .",
    "it is just this value that is determined by the primordial power spectrum .",
    "the connection between @xmath13 and @xmath12 is very simple in a case of the gaussian distribution : @xmath14    the limits on @xmath15 arise from the entropy production constraints @xcite , from a distortion of the microwave background @xcite , from the cosmological nucleosynthesis constraints @xcite . in these cases pbhs which give constraints",
    "have evaporated completely to the present time . on the contrary , the gravitational constraint ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 @xcite , is valid for pbh masses @xmath18 which survive today .",
    "one should stress that all these limits are based just on the approximation that all pbhs form at the same scale and , correspondingly , the initial mass spectrum of pbhs is @xmath9-function - like or , at least , is `` non - extended '' one . only in this case",
    "one can approximately express the observational constraints through the initial mass fraction @xmath15 .",
    "evidently , a more accurate treatment should operate with the initial pbh mass spectrum directly .",
    "the most strong limit on a pbh formation in the early universe is due to the possible contribution of evaporating pbhs to the extragalactic @xmath1-ray and neutrino backgrounds at energies @xmath19 .",
    "the limit of such kind was obtained in the work of page and hawking @xcite , authors of which assumed that the differential initial mass spectrum of pbhs has power law form predicted in carr s work @xcite ,    @xmath20    @xmath21 here , @xmath22 for pbhs formed in radiation - dominated era , @xmath23 is the mass of a black hole whose life - time is equal to the present age of the universe .",
    "this pbh mass spectrum is , clearly , the example of an `` extended '' spectrum ( it was derived in @xcite by considering the pbh formation as a process stretched in time ) .",
    "naturally , the famous page - hawking constraint was formulated in terms of a pbh number density rather than in terms of @xmath15 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the upper limit on the present pbh number density is @xmath24 ( or , that is the same , @xmath25 ) .",
    "this constraint was improved in later works @xcite , where the same initial pbh mass spectrum was used as input .",
    "the derivation of eq.([int_6 ] ) was based on the assumption of exact scale invariance ( scale - independence of the perturbation amplitudes ) . the carr s work @xcite appeared before an advent of the inflation hypothesis , and at that time it seemed improbable that the possible case of a growth of the perturbation amplitudes with a decrease of the scale can be of any importance ( from the point of view of observational evidences of the pbhs existence ) .",
    "now we know that , due to inflation , minimum values of pbh mass in the initial mass spectrum can be rather large ( @xmath26  g or even more ) .",
    "it means that the pbhs can have rather extended mass spectrum even if the primordial fluctuations are not strictly scale invariant .",
    "in general , initial pbh mass spectrum depends on cosmological and astrophysical aspects of the model used for its derivation ( and , through the model , on such parameters as a time of the end of inflation , a reheating temperature , a spectral index of the density perturbations ( or parameters of the inflationary potential ) and , last but not least , on parameters , characterizing the process of the gravitational collapse leading to the pbh s birth ) .",
    "evidently , observational constraints on the pbh production ( especially those derived from measurements of extragalactic diffuse backgrounds of @xmath1-rays and neutrino ) can be used as constraints on at least one of these parameters . clearly , these constraints depend on the initial pbh mass spectrum , i.e. , on the parameters of this spectrum which are considered as free in a course of the constraint s derivation .    usually , the parameters characterizing primordial density fluctuation amplitudes ( e.g. , the spectral index , if it is scale independent ) are objects of the constraining",
    ". parameters of the gravitational collapse and a method used for a summation over epochs of the pbh formation ( if such a summation is performed ) determine , by definition , the _ type _ of the initial pbh mass spectrum .",
    "all other parameters ( characterizing , in particular , the end of inflation and the beginning of radiation dominated era ) are `` external '' and considered as free ones .    in the present work we obtain some cosmological constraints following from the possible contribution of pbh evaporations in extragalactic diffuse neutrino background . assuming that the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations has a power - law form , @xmath27 , we present the observational limits as constraints on values of the spectral index @xmath28 ( using the normalization on cobe data ) . in a more general case of the non - power @xmath29-dependence",
    "one can directly constrain parameters of a concrete inflation model .",
    "we consider , as an example , a case of the running mass inflation model @xcite and obtain constraints on parameters of the corresponding inflationary potential .",
    "the main physical assumption used in the work is that a pbh formation process occurs during radiation dominated era only .",
    "the main `` external '' parameter is @xmath6 , a time of the beginning of radiation era . at this moment of time we have , by assumption , the primordial spectrum of density perturbations , and no primordial black holes . in a short period between the end of inflation and @xmath6",
    "there can be additional amplification of density perturbation amplitudes ( e.g. , in a preheating phase ) but , by assumption , in this period there is no pbh formation .",
    "the time @xmath6 is connected by a usual way with a corresponding initial temperature of radiation era , which we call a reheating temperature @xmath30 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.[sec : init_mass_sp ] we derive , using the press and schechter formalism , the general formula for the initial pbh spectrum which is valid for any law of @xmath29-dependence and for a wide class of models of the gravitational collapse . in sec.[sec : diff_typ_sp ] we give the comparative analysis of different types of initial pbh mass spectra used in concrete calculations . in sec.[sec : neut_bg_sp ] the neutrino background spectra from pbh evaporations are derived and the corresponding constraints on cosmological parameters are obtained . discussions and conclusions are presented in sec.[sec : dis_and_con ] .",
    "according to the press - schechter theory @xcite , the mass distribution function @xmath31 , which is defined such that @xmath32 is the comoving number density of gravitationally bound objects in the mass range @xmath33 , is determined by the equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite )    @xmath34    @xmath35    here , @xmath36 is the _ rms _ mass fluctuation on a mass scale @xmath37 , i.e. , a standard deviation of the density contrast of the density field smoothed on a size @xmath38 having mean mass @xmath37 , @xmath39 is a fraction of the volume occupied by the regions that will eventually collapse into bound objects with masses larger than @xmath37 ( @xmath10 is a minimum value of the density contrast needed for developing a nonlinear growth of the density fluctuations in the overdense region ) .",
    "the density @xmath40 is , in our case , the background energy density at the initial moment of time , @xmath41 ( it is a moment of a beginning of the growth of the density fluctuations ) .    by the construction , eq.([1_1 ] ) supposes a step - by - step formation of the whole mass spectrum of gravitationaly bound objects ( pbhs , in our case ) .",
    "heavier pbhs form at later times when corresponding masses of overdense regions cross horizon .",
    "the nonzero probability that small pbhs are included in larger ones at later times is approximately taken into account by the differentiation of @xmath42 with @xmath37 .",
    "the correct normalization of the spectrum is ensured by the extra factor 2 in eq.([1_2 ] ) .",
    "introducing the double differential distribution @xmath43 @xcite defined by the expression @xmath44 one obtains from eqs.([1_1]-[1_2 ] ) @xmath45 the _ rms _ mass fluctuation @xmath36 is given by the integral @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the smoothing window function , @xmath48 is the ( nonsmoothed ) horizon crossing amplitude , @xmath49 is the transfer function taking into account the microphysical processing of density perturbations after entering horizon , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are a cosmic scale factor and an expansion rate .",
    "there are two time - dependent factors in the right hand side of eq.([1_5 ] ) : the factor @xmath52 in the denominator describing a growth of the perturbations with time and the transfer function .",
    "we need the amplitude @xmath36 at the initial moment of time , @xmath41 .",
    "a role of the transfer function is essential at large @xmath53 , if an integrand in eq.([1_5 ] ) is not cut off by a @xmath53-dependence of the window function and @xmath54 . in the case",
    "when a top - hat window function is used and @xmath55 with @xmath56 , the contribution of large @xmath53 modes in the integrand is rather large and a convergence of the integral in eq.([1_5 ] ) is provided just by the transfer function .",
    "the form of this function at an epoch of the pbh formation is , of course , model dependent .",
    "one can assume , for simplicity , that at @xmath41 the transfer function has a simplest form : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the step function , and the border value @xmath59 is of the order of @xmath60 , the horizon scale at the end of inflation @xcite . from our point of view , however , one can not exclude the possibility that @xmath61 .",
    "if eq.([1_5a ] ) is assumed , the equation ( [ 1_5 ] ) can be rewritten , for a power - law of the primordial power spectrum and a top - hat window function , as @xmath62 @xmath63 ^ 2 d x.\\ ] ]    if the spectral index @xmath28 is slightly more than one , @xmath64 , and if @xmath65 one has @xmath66 , i.e. , the value of @xmath67 is close to the corresponding value @xcite for the present epoch . having no reliable model for the transfer function at early postinflationary epoch",
    ", we assume everywhere below , where a power - law form of @xmath29 is used , that @xmath67 is constant , and equal to @xmath68 , throughout all times .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath69    in eq.([1_6 ] ) @xmath70 is the comoving wave number , characterizing the perturbed region , @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the fluctuation mass at the moment when the perturbed region crosses horizon in radiation dominated era .",
    "the value of @xmath72 is expressed through @xmath70 ( see below ) . the function @xmath73 introduced by eq.([1_6 ] ) is , evidently , the smoothed horizon crossing amplitude ( a standard deviation of the density contrast at a moment when the fluctuation crosses horizon ) .",
    "the general formula for @xmath74 , which is valid for an arbitrary @xmath53-dependence of @xmath29 , is @xmath75    at the moment @xmath76 when the fluctuation crosses horizon one has @xmath77 and , in radiation dominated era @xmath78 , @xmath79    at the same time , an initial value of the fluctuation mass , @xmath37 , is proportional to @xmath80 , so @xmath81 .",

    "a concrete form of the initial mass spectrum of primordial black holes is determined , first of all , by peculiarities of the gravitational collapse near a threshold of the black hole formation . according to analytic calculations of seventies @xcite",
    "a critical size of the density contrast needed for the pbh formation , @xmath10 , is about @xmath111 . besides",
    ", it was argued that all pbhs have mass roughly equal to the horizon mass at a moment of the formation , independently of the perturbation size .",
    "the approximate connection between the pbh mass and the horizon mass in such models is very simple @xcite : @xmath112 where @xmath1 is the ratio of the pressure to energy density ( @xmath113 in radiation dominated era ) .",
    "however , it was shown recently that near a threshold of the black hole formation the gravitational collapse behaves as a critical phenomenon @xcite . in this case",
    "the initial mass function will be quite different from the analogous function in the analytic calculations @xcite .",
    "the main feature is that the pbh mass formed depends on a size of the fluctuation @xcite , @xmath114 in this formula @xmath72 is the horizon mass at the time when the fluctuation enters horizon ; @xmath10 ,",
    "@xmath115 , @xmath1 are parameters of a concrete model of the critical collapse @xcite .",
    "the corresponding @xmath116 function defined in eq.([1_17 ] ) is determined using the relation ( [ 1_10 ] ) : @xmath117 it is seen from eq.([1 ] ) that the pbh mass may be arbitrarily small independently of the value of @xmath72 . besides , a value of the critical overdensity , @xmath10 , in such models is typically @xmath118 , i.e. , about a factor of 2 larger than the value used in the standard collapse case .",
    "the second important ingredient of a pbh initial mass spectrum calculation is a taking into account the spread of horizon masses at which pbhs are formed .",
    "this problem exists independently of a nature of the gravitational collapse .",
    "as is stated in the _ introduction _ , it is assumed very often that a majority of the pbh formation processes occurs at the shortest possible scale . in particular , the authors of ref.@xcite determined the pbh initial mass function under the assumption that all pbhs form at the same horizon mass .",
    "the accuracy of such an approximation was studied in the work @xcite using the excursion set formalism , and it was found that it is good enough , at least in a case of the power - law density perturbation spectra with the spectral index close to @xmath119 ( i.e. , slightly `` blue '' spectra , with the value of @xmath28 satisfying observational constraints ) .    as it follows from the previous section , the effect of an accumulation of pbhs formed at all epochs after the beginning of ordinary radiation era can be conveniently taken into account by the press - schechter formalism @xcite .",

    "one can see from fig.1 that at large values of the spectral index ( @xmath145 ) there is a clear difference in a behavior of two mass spectra , nj and bk , based both on a picture of the critical collapse : bk spectrum is less steep at @xmath146 . of course",

    "it includes the pure hawking term and contributions from fragmentations of evaporated quarks and from decays of pions and muons ( see @xcite and earlier papers @xcite for details ) . the exponential factor in eq.([10 ] ) takes into account an absorption of the radiation during its propagation in space .",
    "the processes of the neutrino absorption are considered , in a given context , in ref.@xcite .    in the last line of eq.([10 ] ) we changed the variable @xmath159 on @xmath161 using the flat model with @xmath162 for which @xmath163    on first five figures ( figs.[fig : fig2]-[fig : fig6 ] ) some results of calculations for the case of a scale independent spectral index are presented .",
    "several examples of @xmath161-distributions ( the integrands of the integral over @xmath161 in eq.([10 ] ) ) are shown on fig.2 .",
    "again one can see the rather strong difference of two cases : the existence of a tail of heavy masses in bk spectrum leads to a relative enhancement of low @xmath161-contributions .",
    "the effect becomes more distinct with a rise of the reheating temperature .",
    "the sharp cut - off of all @xmath161-distributions near @xmath164 is entirely due to the neutrino absorption @xcite .",
    "the shrinkage of @xmath161-distributions at large @xmath30 in nj - case is due to the absence of large masses in the spectrum ( pbhs of small masses evaporated earlier , and their radiation today is more redshifted ) .    some results of calculations of the neutrino background spectra are shown on figs.3 - 5 .",
    "the functional form of these spectra is qualitatively the same as in the standard collapse case @xcite : @xmath165 law at large neutrino energies and a flat part at low energies with the crossover energy depending on @xmath30 .",
    "the only new feature is the sharp steepening of the spectra at high values of @xmath30 in nj case ( fig.4 ) connected with the corresponding shrinkage of the @xmath161-range .",
    "fig.5 shows the sensitivity of background neutrino intensities to a chosen value of the spectral index  @xmath28 , at a fixed @xmath30 .",
    "one can see from this figure that the neutrino background flux from pbh evaporations is comparable with the theoretical curve @xcite for the atmospheric neutrino flux at @xmath19 if @xmath166 ( at @xmath167 ) .",
    "such large values of the spectral index are , probably , excluded by the recent large - scale experiments .",
    "next figure shows the constraints on the spectral index following from data of neutrino experiments , as a function of the reheating temperature . as in our previous work , we used for a description of these constraints the data of the kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment @xcite and the experiment on a search of an antineutrino flux from the sun @xcite ( see @xcite for details ) .    for completeness , we show on the same figure the constraints following from extragalactic diffuse gamma ray data ; part of them ( nj case ) is in qualitative agreement with the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "it is seen that the constraints are much more weak in nj case ( at @xmath168 ) .",
    "it is again the result of an absence of the tail of large masses in nj spectrum , leading to a shrinkage of the @xmath161-distributions and to a steepening of the background neutrino spectra .",
    "one can see from fig.[fig : fig6 ] that , in general , spectral index constraints following from the comparison of neutrino background predictions with existing data of neutrino experiments are rather weak if the purely power law of primordial density fluctuations is assumed for all scales ( and , correspondingly , the normalization on cobe data is used ) .",
    "however , it does not mean that neutrino background intensities from pbh s evaporations can not be noticeable .",
    "if , for example , the spectrum of primordial density fluctuations is a combination of two simple power law spectra @xcite , i.e. , @xmath169 then the small value of @xmath170 ( @xmath171 ) which follows , in particular , from cobe data , does not contradict with the possibility that @xmath172 is large and , correspondingly , @xmath88 at small scales is also large .",
    "if @xmath173 and @xmath174 are known from some model , one can easily obtain from the neutrino data the constraints on the small scale spectral index @xmath175 , in the same manner as it is done above for the all scale spectral index @xmath28 .",
    "several cosmological models of such kind , which predict a large density fluctuation amplitude just on small scales ( while the amplitude on large scales is constrained by the small cmbr anisotropy ) appeared recently .",
    "the general problem of all these models is that the large density perturbations on small scales can lead to an overproduction of the primordial black holes .",
    "an origin of the large density perturbations and the scale where they are close to maximum depend on the model .",
    "for example , hybrid inflation models with two stages of inflation @xcite predict a characteristic spike in the perturbation spectrum , and the model parameters ( those determining a duration of the second stage of inflation ) can be chosen so that pbhs evaporations give large contributions to extragalactic backgrounds of neutrinos and @xmath1-quanta .",
    "inflation models with a subsequent preheating phase also predict perturbation spectra growing strongly toward small scales @xcite ( as a result of the resonant enhancement of field fluctuations during preheating ) .    at the end of this section we consider , with more details , the case of running mass inflation models , which also give a spectral index with rather strong scale dependence .",

    "this form corresponds to a loop correction coming from softly broken global supersymmetry .",

    "the expression ( [ 4_2 ] ) for @xmath198 has two parameters : @xmath12 and @xmath177 .",
    "if we suppose that the spectral index at @xmath199 is known from experiment ( e.g. , according to ref.@xcite , it follows from cobe data that @xmath200 ) , we exclude one parameter ( e.g. , @xmath12 ) .",
    "now we can use the same steps as above to obtain the constraints on the parameter @xmath177 .",
    "the only difference is that now one must use the general expressions for the pbh mass spectrum , eq.([1_20 ] ) , and for @xmath201 , eq.([1_7a ] ) .",
    "these constraints are shown on fig.[fig : fig7 ] for three possible values of @xmath202 .",
    "solid lines on the figure correspond to the critical collapse case , dotted line ( calculated for the value @xmath203 only ) correspond to the standard picture of the collapse .",
    "the lines show the upper limits of the parameter @xmath177 .",
    "one can clearly see the difference between two cases : the sharp rise of the dotted curve at @xmath204 is directly connected with the sharp cut - off of the initial mass spectrum ( for the standard collapse case ) at @xmath149 .",
    "indeed , due to the proportionality @xmath205 at small enough reheating temperatures the minimum values of the pbh mass in the spectrum are too large and , therefore , the large part of pbhs can not evaporate until the present time .",
    "finally , on fig.[fig : fig8 ] we show the resulting constraint curves for the horizon crossing amplitude @xmath48 , for fixed values of @xmath202 and @xmath30 ( for the critical collapse case ) .",
    "the curves correspond to the upper limits of the parameter @xmath177 shown on the previous figure .",
    "the end points of the power spectrum on the figure is determined from eq.([4_6 ] ) .",
    "it is seen from fig.[fig : fig8 ] that allowed values of @xmath206 at the shortest scale ( for a given @xmath30 ) are rather large , @xmath207 the corresponding @xmath88 value is @xmath208 . at @xmath209",
    "the shortest scale , @xmath210 , corresponds to a rather small value of the horizon mass , @xmath211 .",
    "pbhs of such a small mass evaporated at @xmath212 .",
    "the main conclusion of the work is the following : constraints on parameters of cosmological models from evaporations of primordial black holes depend rather strongly on a form of their initial mass spectrum .",
    "number densities of pbhs predicted by the models are extremely sensitive to values of primordial density perturbation amplitudes and , therefore , even very steeply falling mass spectra of pbhs can give useful constraints . as it follows from fig.[fig : fig6 ] , constraints on the scale independent spectral index @xmath28 at high values of a reheating temperature are drastically different in nj and bk cases .",
    "we thoroughly traced the origin of this result : the absence of a long _ high mass tail _ in the initial nj spectrum ( fig.[fig : fig1 ] ) leads to a relative shrinkage of the redshift distributions of evaporated neutrinos ( fig.[fig : fig2 ] ) and , as a consequence , to a steepening of the neutrino background spectra and to a decrease of the background intensities ( fig.[fig : fig4 ] ) , resulting , eventually , in a weakening of the spectral index constraint .",
    "so , the constraint values at @xmath213 on fig.[fig : fig6 ] are entirely due to an effect of the summation over all epochs of the pbh formation in the approach of ref.@xcite .",
    "analogously , we see , on an example of the parameter @xmath177 of running mass inflation models , that the constraints at low values of @xmath30 also depend on a type of the gravitational collapse : in the standard collapse case the constraint at @xmath214 is practically absent ( dotted curve on fig.[fig : fig7 ] ) due to a corresponding absence of a _ low mass tail _ in the initial pbh mass spectrum of this case ( compare kl and bk spectra on fig.[fig : fig1 ] ; the behavior of the corresponding pbh mass spectra in a case of a scale dependent @xmath28 is qualitatively similar ) .    the initial number density of pbhs is larger in a case of the standard picture of the gravitational collapse ( as compared with the critical collapse case ) .",
    "it is due to relatively small value of the critical overdensity ( @xmath215 ) . in the region near the maximum of pbh mass spectra",
    "the ratio of intensities is given by the approximate relation @xmath216 correspondingly , intensities of the neutrino and gamma backgrounds produced by pbh s evaporations are smaller and spectral index constraints are systematically weaker in the critical collapse case ( see , for the comparison with the standard collapse case , fig.10 of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is worth noting that spectral index constraints followed from neutrino evaporations are stronger at high @xmath30 values ( as compared with the constraints from @xmath1-quanta ) , especially in the nj case ( fig.[fig : fig6 ] ) .",
    "the reason is simple : at high @xmath30 the relative contribution of large redshifts in @xmath161-distributions is very large ( fig.[fig : fig2 ] ) and , correspondingly , the absorption of @xmath0 ,  @xmath1 during propagation in space is important",
    ". naturally , absorption effects are more sufficient for @xmath1-quanta than for neutrinos ( for @xmath1-quanta @xmath217 , while for neutrinos @xmath218 @xcite , as we can see , in particular , from curves of fig.[fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "one should note that , in general , the constraints on a scale independent spectral index followed from pbh evaporations ( fig.[fig : fig6 ] ) are rather weak . probably , so large deviations of the spectral index from 1 ( @xmath219 ) are excluded by the latest data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , constraints from pbh evaporations are more useful for those cosmological models in which the spectral index is scale dependent .",
    "in such models large density perturbation amplitude at small scales ( and , correspondingly , large effects from evaporations ) can coexist with the small value of @xmath48 at cobe scale ( fig.[fig : fig8 ] ) .",
    "we showed in this paper , using , as an example , the running mass inflation model , that in this case the pbh evaporation process can be used for a constraining of model parameters [ in particular , parameters of an inflationary potential , ( fig[fig : fig7 ] ) ] .",
    "we stress , once more , that all constraints of such type depend on assumptions used in a derivation of the initial pbh mass spectrum .    ya .",
