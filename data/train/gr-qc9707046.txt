    ", it was known that the momentum constraints require any wave functional to be diffeomorphism invariant @xcite . in a wkb approximation",
    ", such a requirement translates into the diffeomorphism invariance of the generating functional .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint is a non - linear functional partial differential equation that governs the time evolution of the generating functional .",
    "based on peres formalism , parry , salopek , and stewart used a series expansion of the generating functional in spatial gradients of the fields to derive an order - by - order approximate solution of the hamiltonian constraint for general relativity with matter fields ( see ref .",

    "such a generating functional is diffeomorphism invariant in each order of the expansion .",
    "salopek and bond used this formalism to show how non - linear effects of the metric and scalar fields may be included in stochastic inflationary models .",
    "the main advantage of this analysis is that the lapse function and shift vectors do not appear in the ehj equations .",
    "therefore , one obtains a coordinate - free approach to cosmological perturbations . in",
    "the above models matter fields consist of self - interacting scalar and dust fields .    in this article",
    "the above formalism is extended to minimally coupled gravitationally interacting scalar and electromagnetic fields .",
    "such minimally coupled electromagnetic fields give rise to conformally invariant field equations .",
    "hence , the electromagnetic field energy density is proportional to @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the scale factor",

    "other gauge - invariant quantities like @xmath26 could also be included in @xmath23 .",
    "however , if the space - like surfaces of simultaneity are simply connected , one can write all such quantities in terms of @xmath27 using stokes theorem . non - simply connected three - manifolds are not considered here .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint determines the time evolution of the fields .",
    "following pss , an order - by - order solution of the hamiltonian constraint is achieved by the expansion of the generating functional in spatial gradients : where @xmath28 denotes the number of spatial gradients in @xmath29 .",
    "it turns out that the scalar field is indispensable in this model and dominates the dynamics of the space - time .",
    "moreover , in the limit @xmath30 , in the absence of electromagnetism , the zeroth order solution is exact .",
    "therefore , merely based on dimensional grounds , this heuristically suggests the expansion parameter should obey @xmath31 . in this relation",
    ", @xmath32 is an appropriate combination of the curvature invariants of dimension @xmath33 such that in the flat space limit where the three - curvature is vanishing @xmath34 , and @xmath3 represents the potential energy density of the scalar field . the convergence of the above series is an unsolved problem @xcite .",
    "an order - by - order solution of the ehj equation is achieved by substituting ( [ spatial ] ) in the first equation in ( [ hconstraint ] ) and the subsequent expansion of @xmath35 in spatial gradients : and requiring the ehj equation to vanish at each order . in the above equation",
    "one can easily obtain the first few terms in ( [ spatial ] ) by an ansatz .",
    "the zeroth order term called the long - wavelength approximation ( lwa ) , is the same as in pss for some arbitrary function @xmath36 . inserting @xmath37 in ( [ h0 ] ) yields electromagnetism has no dynamical degrees of freedom at this order .",
    "the lwa is very important in structure formation after inflation .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that electromagnetic fields play a significant role in structure formation in this model . for @xmath38 at each order , @xmath39 is a linear hyperbolic functional differential equation in the unknown functional @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath40 is the next non - vanishing term given by the above terms are not the only terms quadratic in spatial gradients in @xmath40 .",

    "it is easy to verify that @xmath40 satisfies the momentum and gauss law constraints .",
    "one notices that @xmath43 is already quadratic in spatial derivatives and does not appear in the second order ehj equation @xmath44 . after inserting @xmath40 in the second order ehj equation and grouping together the coefficients of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and",
    "@xmath48 one respectively has at first sight , ( [ s2eqn ] ) seems to be an over - determined system for three unknown functions , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath14 .",
    "however , by solving @xmath51 for @xmath50 , one can show that @xmath52 is not independent and obeys the relation @xmath53 . in the spatial gradient expansion of the generating functional @xmath23 for the scalar fields in the absence of electromagnetism",
    ", there is no contribution from odd order terms .",
    "electromagnetism makes non - trivial contributions to odd orders .",
    "the only non - vanishing term in @xmath54 is all other third order terms like @xmath55 either vanish or are total divergences . to solve the third - order ehj equation @xmath56 one has to use the relation @xmath57 .",
    "the solution yields @xmath54 non - trivially satisfies the momentum and gauss law constraints . to show this , one frequently uses the identity @xmath58 for any vector field @xmath59 , achieved from @xmath60 and multiplication of both sides by @xmath61 .",
    "equations ( [ s0eqn ] ) , ( [ s2eqn ] ) , and ( [ s3eqn ] ) form a set of differential equations , easily solvable for most relevant potentials . nevertheless , the full set of differential equations becomes increasingly complicated at higher orders . as in pss",
    "one can use the expression for @xmath37 and the conformal transformation to solve the ehj equations ( [ hjeqn ] ) .",
    "the ehj equations transforms into where @xmath62 is the conformal curvature and all indices are raised and lowered with the conformal metric @xmath63 .",
    "the proof of the integrability of ( [ conformal2 ] ) for gravitationally interacting electromagnetic and scalar fields proceeds similar to what was outlined in @xcite . by using the expression for @xmath64 from ( [ conformal3 ] ) , a functional integration of ( [ conformal2 ] ) gives rise to the following expression for @xmath40 : where the complementary functionals @xmath65 , @xmath66 are constants of integration . in the next order @xmath67 , therefore @xmath68 is the most general form of @xmath54 in which @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the covariant derivative and levi - civita tensor associated with @xmath63 respectively .",
    "conformal transformation of this expression gives rise to functional integration of ( [ conformal2 ] ) in the next order gives rise to where @xmath71 are given in pss . in the above expression @xmath72",
    "are defined as in which @xmath73 .",
    "once the ehj equations are solved , the evolution equations for the fields are obtained from ( [ fieldphi]-[fielda ] ) and ( [ momenta2 ] ) .",
    "a judicious choice of gauge greatly simplifies the field equations . in the almost synchronous gauge ( @xmath74 ) if @xmath75 is the time parameter , from ( [ fieldphi ] ) it follows that in the lwa ( i.e @xmath76 ) the lapse obeys @xmath77 .",
    "the superscript @xmath78 means that the right hand side of the equation contains terms up to @xmath79th order in spatial gradients .",
    "the choice of @xmath75 as the time parameter is valid as long as the geometry is sufficiently close to that of the homogeneous models ( for a relevant discussion see ref .",
    "then it is useful to replace ( [ fieldmetric ] ) with the equivalent evolution equation for the conformal metric @xmath63 which is related to @xmath80 via in the lwa @xmath81 .",
    "@xmath82 is the seed metric that contains no dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "the first non - trivial evolution equation for @xmath83 in the temporal gauge @xmath84 , is obtained from the conformal transformation of ( [ fielda ] ) : since @xmath85 and @xmath69 commute , the evolution equation for @xmath27 is easily derived from the above equations to be with the solution in the above equation and what follows , @xmath86 is an arbitrary antisymmetric tensor field , @xmath87 refers to the covariant derivative with respect to the seed metric and the indices are raised with the seed metric .",
    "the exponential of the matrix differential operator is defined as : @xmath88}\\nabla_k\\nabla^m \\right.\\\\ & + & \\left.\\frac{1}{2!}\\left(8\\int\\omega^{-1}l(u)\\;du\\right)^2 { \\delta}^p_{[i}{\\delta}^q_{j]}\\nabla_p\\nabla^r{\\delta}^k_{[q}{\\delta}^l_{r]}\\nabla_k\\nabla^m+ \\cdots\\right\\}{\\cal f}_{ml}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] once the evolution equations for the fields are solved , the evolution equations for the momenta are easily derived from ( [ momenta2 ] ) . in particular , the electric field obeys the equation in higher orders ( [ fieldphi ] ) shows that @xmath89 . for example , where @xmath90 is the three - curvature associated with the seed metric @xmath82",
    ". obviously , the higher order evolution equations are more complicated .",
    "the third order evolution of the conformal metric is derived from ( [ fieldconformal ] ) and ( [ n3 ] ) to obey    as a demonstration of an application of the formalism developed so far , one could compute @xmath91 for an arbitrary magnetic field @xmath92 and seed metric @xmath93 with a scalar potential @xmath94 .",
    "the general solution of ( [ s0eqn ] ) for @xmath95 is given in @xcite .",
    "the general parametric solution of ( [ s0eqn ] ) with @xmath96 and @xmath97 as functions of an independent variable @xmath98 is , where @xmath99 is the integration constant .",
    "a special solution of ( [ s0eqn ] ) for @xmath95 is that corresponds to the halliwell attractor @xcite . by using ( [ conformal1 ] ) , ( [ 3metricconf ] ) , ( [ halliwell ] ) and with a choice of time parameter such that @xmath100 , the contribution of all the terms second order in spatial gradients to the evolution of the conformal metric at this order is where @xmath101 is the integration constant and the seed metric is absorbed to raise indices .",
    "integration of the above equation yields after taking ( [ 3metric ] ) and ( [ 3conformalmetric ] ) into account , the three - metric is given by two points regarding the above equation are in order .",
    "first , as a perturbation of a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) model , the growth of inhomogeneities from terms second order in spatial gradients is encoded in @xmath102 .",
    "one notices that with the choice of @xmath75 as the time parameter , such a growth resulting from the curvature is insensitive to the exact form of the exponential potential . in other words , deviations from a flat frw cosmology resulting from a magnetic field",
    "evolve quite differently from that of the inhomogeneities due to the space - time geometry .",
    "in particular , one notices that if @xmath103 , the contribution of a primordial magnetic field to spatial inhomogeneities decays rapidly .",
    "secondly , the reader is cautioned against a mini - superspace perturbation of a flat frw model , namely , a perturbation within a mini - superspace cosmology .",
    "for example , for a vanishing magnetic field in a bianchi i cosmology where the conformal three - curvature is vanishing ( _ i.e. _ @xmath104 ) , one would get the obviously incorrect result @xmath105 for @xmath106 ( because @xmath107 for @xmath108 ) .",
    "the exact evolution equation for such a model could be derived from ( [ momenta1]-[momenta3 ] ) and ( [ fieldphi]-[fielda ] ) which could be solved numerically for generic initial conditions .",
    "this problem also exists in the dust model treated in pss which has been quite successful in deriving the contribution of short wavelength fields to structure formation and the anisotropies of microwave background radiation .",
    "the spatial gradient expansion of the generating functional was developed by pss to solve the hamiltonian constraint in ehj formulation of general relativity for gravitationally interacting dust and scalar fields .",
    "the spatial gradient expansion could be consistently applied to solve the hamiltonian constraint for gravitationally interacting electromagnetic and scalar fields . at each order ,",
    "the ehj equation is a linear functional partial differential equation in the unknown functional @xmath29 which after a conformal transformation could be integrated to yield @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath40 and @xmath54 were calculated in detail and @xmath109 was given .",
    "such an order - by - order solution of the ehj equation gives rise to order - by - order corrections to the fields evolving in a flat frw model .",
    "the corrections are due the presence of spatial inhomogeneities and magnetic field .",
