    "quite a number of physical , chemical , and biological systems manifest some type of modulation in their spatial ordering  @xcite .",
    "such structures are stripes and bubbles in two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems , or lamellae , hexagonally packed cylinders , and cubic arrays of spheres in three - dimensional ( 3d ) cases as well as more complex structures such as gyroids .",
    "examples of such systems include ferromagnetic layers  @xcite , magnetic garnet films  @xcite , ferrofluids  @xcite , dipolar langmuir films  @xcite , rippled phases in lipid bilayers  @xcite , and block copolymers  @xcite .",
    "modulated phases may also occur in systems described by two ( or more ) coupled order parameters , each favoring a different equilibrium state  @xcite .",
    "the observed spatial patterns exhibit striking similarity even for systems that are very different in their nature .",
    "it is generally understood that the modulated structures are formed spontaneously due to the competition between short- and long - range interactions .    in the case of 2d ferromagnetic layers , for example",
    ", the short - range interaction arises from magnetic domain wall energy , while the long - range interaction is due to magnetic dipole - dipole interaction which induces a demagnetizing field  @xcite . adding both contributions and minimizing the total free energy with respect to the wavenumber @xmath0 , one obtains the most stable mode @xmath1 .",
    "this description is valid in the weak segregation limit ( close to a critical point ) , where the equilibrium domain size is given by @xmath2 . in general , this quantity depends on temperature and/or other external fields .    in this paper , we shall consider two modulated monolayers that are jointly coupled .",
    "our motivation is related to recent experiments by collins and keller  @xcite who investigated montal - mueller planar bilayer membranes  @xcite composed of lipids and cholesterol . in this technique ,",
    "a bilayer is constructed by preparing separately two independent monolayers and then combining them into one joint bilayer across a hole at the air / water interface .",
    "the experiments addressed specifically the question of liquid domains in the two leaflets , and the mutual influence of the monolayers in terms of their domain phases . in the experiment , asymmetric bilayers are prepared in such a way that one leaflet s composition would phase - separate in a symmetric bilayer and the other s would not",
    ". in some cases , one leaflet may induce phase separation in the other leaflet , whereas in other cases , the second leaflet suppresses domain formation in the original leaflet .",
    "these results imply that the two leaflet coupling is important ingredient in determining the bilayer phase state .",
    "motivated by these experiments , the coupled bilayer system was investigated theoretically . the coupling mechanism arises through interactions between lipid tails across the bilayer midplane , and the phase behavior of such a bilayer membrane was computed using either regular solution theory  @xcite or landau theory  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical results are in accord with several of the experimental observations .",
    "it should be noted that all previous models dealt with the coupling between two _ macro  phase _ separated leaflets , while it is also of interest to investigate the coupling between two _ micro  phase _ separated ( modulated ) leaflets .",
    "furthermore , one might also consider the interplay between a macro and a micro  phase separation .",
    "in the present work , we suggest a model describing the coupling between two modulated systems , and , in particular , we analyze the influence of this coupling on the phase behavior of two coupled 2d monolayers .",
    "when the two monolayers have the same preferred periodicity of modulation , we obtain the mean - field phase diagrams which exhibit various combinations of micro  phase separated structures . in some cases",
    ", the periodic structure in one of the monolayers will induce a modulation in the other monolayer .",
    "interesting situations take place when the two monolayers have different preferred wavelengths of modulation . here",
    "the frustrations between the two competing modulated structures need to be optimized . these structures and their dynamical behavior",
    "are examined using numerical simulations .",
    "although there has been so far no experiment which directly corresponds to the proposed model , our predictions may be verified , for example , by constructing montal - mueller bilayers  @xcite out of two lipid monolayers that exhibit a striped phase near the miscibility critical point  @xcite .    in the next section",

    "although we limit our present analysis to 2d systems , the suggested model can be generalized to 3d systems as well .",
    "in order to illustrate the coupling effect between two modulated systems , we imagine a pair of lipid monolayers forming a coupled bilayer . each of the monolayer can undergo separately a micro  phase separation . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we assume that each monolayer is a mixture of two lipid species , say lipid a and lipid b. their area fractions are defined by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the 2d positional vector . by assuming that the monolayer is incompressible , @xmath6 , the monolayer composition can be characterized by a single order parameter defined by the relative a / b composition @xmath7 .",

    "( [ freeenergy ] ) has some analogies to the previous model for the rippled phase in lipid bilayers  @xcite .",

    "@xcite investigated various modulated phases in two - component bilayer membranes .",
    "they claimed that the phase behavior of two - component bilayers resembles that of three - component monolayer .",
    "this is because the three different local combinations of upper / lower composition in bilayers ( a / b , b / a , and a / a for excess of a ) , would correspond to three different types of molecules for the monolayer .",
    "one of the new aspects in our model is that the preferred wavelengths of the two monolayers can , in general , be different from one another leading to a frustrated bilayer state .",
    "we also point out that there are some similarities between coupled modulated structures and the problem of atoms adsorbed on a periodic solid substrate .",
    "the latter topic has been extensively studied within the frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model which provides a simple description of the commensurate - incommensurate transition  @xcite .",
    "our model and the fk model are analogous in the sense that there are two natural length scales whose ratio changes as a function of other model parameters . in the fk model , however , these length scales are quenched , whereas in our model they are annealed .",
    "another related experimental system can be seen for surface - induced ordering in thin film of diblock copolymers  @xcite .",
    "when the surface is periodically patterned , a tilt of the lamellae is induced in order to match the surface periodicity .",
    "the situation becomes more complex if a copolymer melt is confined between two surfaces .",
    "an interesting case arises when the spacing between the two surfaces is incommensurate with the lamellar periodicity  @xcite .    for systems out of equilibrium",

    "these models were successful in reproducing hexagonal superlattice patterns which are known as `` black - eyes '' .",

    "a more detailed study of the present model and several interesting extensions will be published elsewhere .",
    "one possible extension is to consider vector order parameters describing , for example , the molecular tilt for coupled bilayers  @xcite .",
