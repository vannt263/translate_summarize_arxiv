    "a correct description of axial - vector mesons is important in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) for several reasons .",
    "the lightest measured axial - vector meson  the @xmath0 resonance  is experimentally ambiguous already in vacuum : according to listings of the particle data group ( pdg @xcite ) , the decay width of @xmath1 possesses values between 250 mev and 600 mev .",
    "there is only one class of mesons distinct from axial - vectors with similar values of decay widths : the scalar mesons , the theoretical and experimental description of which is famously ambiguous ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the large decay width renders experimental as well as theoretical determination of the properties of @xmath1 rather problematic.additionally , it is well - known that the qcd lagrangian with @xmath2 massless quark flavours possesses an exact @xmath3 axial symmetry . consequently , a conserved axial - vector current of the form @xmath4 arises , where @xmath5 denotes a quark flavour , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are dirac matrices and @xmath8 represent generators of the chiral @xmath9 chiral group with @xmath2 flavours , @xmath10 . an axial rotation of this current leads to a conserved vector current of the form @xmath11 . identifying ( putatively ) the latter two currents with the @xmath1 and @xmath12 mesons , respectively",
    ", leads to the assertion that the latter two resonances should be degenerate in vacuum .",
    "the opposite is observed due to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry @xcite ; however , the mentioned degeneration is expected to be restored at finite temperatures and densities ( the so - called chiral transition ) .",
    "a viable theoretical description of this postulated high - temperature phenomenon requires a satisfactory description of axial - vectors already in vacuum  and such a description is an objective of this article .",
    "( note that claims have been made @xcite that the vector current is actually a mixture of two rotated chiral - partner fields , an axial - vector and a pseudovector one . as a first approximation , we will neglect this possibility . ) in this article , we present a linear sigma model containing scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector mesons both in the non - strange and strange sectors ( extended linear sigma model or elsm@xcite ) .",
    "the model contains only @xmath13 states @xcite rendering it appropriate to study not only general features ( masses / decays ) of mesons but also their structure  if a physical resonance can be accommodated within our model , then it possesses the @xmath14 structure .",
    "this criterion is important for scalars paper1,leshouches but also for axial - vectors considering the claims that , e.g. , @xmath1 represents a meson - meson molecule rather than a quarkonium @xcite .",
    "consequently , this paper will consider the issue whether the @xmath1 meson can be accommodated within elsm , i.e. , if @xmath15 can be described as ( predominantly ) a @xmath13 state .",

    "we assign our @xmath67 and @xmath68 states to @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "spontaneous chiral - symmetry breaking requires a shift of the fields @xmath65 and @xmath66 by their respective vacuum expectation values @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "we then observe that mixing terms containing axial - vectors and pseudoscalars and @xmath73 and @xmath74 arise in the lagrangian ; these are removed as described in refs .",

    "lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) contains 14 parameters : @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",

    "note that the observables entering the fit allow us to determine only linear combinations @xmath111 and @xmath112 rather than parameters @xmath113 , @xmath86 , @xmath75 and @xmath80 by themselves .",

    ".best - fit results for masses and decay widths compared with experiment .",
    "central values of observables are from ref .",
    ". errors of observables are considered according to the criterion max(5% , experimental error ) .",
    "the reason is that already isospin - breaking effects in the physical hadron mass spectrum are of the order of 5% [ for instance the difference between the charged and neutral pion masses or the masses of @xmath1 and @xmath114 but are completely neglected in our model .",
    "we have therefore artificially increased the experimental errors to 5% if the actual error is smaller or used the experimental values if the error is larger than 5% .

    "table [ table1 ] demonstrates a remarkable correspondence of our results with experimental data in all meson channels .",
    "in particular , our fit yields @xmath119  mev , @xmath120  mev and @xmath121 mev .",
    "note that @xmath122 mev @xcite is the only experimental information regarding the @xmath1 meson which is not an estimate ; our result for @xmath123 is within the experimental interval and , being constrained by abundant experimental input , it even produces an error for @xmath124 that is smaller than the one quoted by pdg . thus results in the non - strange axial - vector channel",
    "justify the interpretation of @xmath1 as ( predominantly ) a @xmath13 state .",
    "our fit allows us to calculate mass and decay width of the strange axial - vector state @xmath125 as a prediction .",
    "we obtain @xmath126 mev , @xmath127 mev , @xmath128 mev and @xmath129 mev .",
    "the mass is very close to the pdg value @xmath130 mev @xcite .",
    "however , the full decay width is @xmath131  mev , while the pdg data read @xmath132  mev and @xmath133  mev .",
    "our result is therefore approximately three times too large when compared to the data for @xmath63 and approximately @xmath134 too large when compared to the data for @xmath64 , even with errors omitted from the calculation .",
    "these results demonstrate the necessity to include a pseudovector @xmath135 nonet into our model and implement its mixing with the already present axial - vector nonet .",
    "we have presented an extended linear sigma model containing ( axial-)vector mesons ( elsm ) .",
    "we have performed a global fit of masses and decay widths from which we have drawn two conclusions : ( _ i _ ) the non - strange axial - vector meson  @xmath54 can be accommodated as a @xmath136 state within our model and ( _ ii _ ) a correct description of the strange axial - vector states @xmath63 and @xmath64 requires the implementation of mixing between an axial - vector and a pseudovector nonet .",
    "the latter also represents an outlook for further investigation of axial - vector mesons ; the model can , however , also be applied to further study other mesons in vacuum and at finite temperatures and densities ( see refs .",
