    "accretion discs are disc - like structures formed by the accumulation of mass onto a central object , such as a young star , due to gravitational attraction @xcite . the infalling material tends to rotate about the center of gravity due to conservation of angular momentum . in a keplerian disc , the angular momentum decreases with decreasing radius , hence a transport mechanism must be provided to remove the excess of angular momentum due to the infalling material .",
    "the most promising mechanism is the generation of turbulence in the presence of a background magnetic field through the magnetorotational instability ( mri ) @xcite .",
    "theoretical studies of turbulence in plasmas have benefited from numerical simulations",
    ". however , the large number of active scales in a turbulent flow requires simulations with high resolution in space and time , which is computationally expensive . in the case of turbulent accretion discs , it is convenient to use a local model called the shearing box formalism @xcite . in this model",
    "the simulation domain is restricted to a box centered at a fiducial disc radius of dimensions much smaller than the size of the disc , allowing to focus on local phenomena such as the growth of unstable modes via mri , turbulent patterns and energy cascades without requiring an extremely high computational effort .    since the numerical work by @xcite , numerical simulations of magnetized keplerian shear flows using the shearing box formalism have shown the formation of large - scale coherent structures called two - channel flows .",
    "these flows arise due to the mri acting on modes with low wavenumbers under certain regimes @xcite , and represent exact solutions of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations @xcite .",
    "the unstable modes grow exponentially and then break , transferring energy to the smaller scales .",
    "different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the destruction of two - channel flows , including parasitic instabilities @xcite and low - level turbulence @xcite .",
    "the generation of two - channel flows via mri makes the shearing box model a test - case to study coherent structures in turbulent flows .",
    "coherent structures are responsible for several important features observed in space and astrophysical plasmas such as non - gaussianity @xcite , multifractality @xcite and phase synchronization among scales @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we analyze three - dimensional ( 3d ) numerical simulations of mri - driven turbulence in magnetized keplerian shear flows using a theoretical framework based on the information entropy theory developed by @xcite , applied to the amplitude and phase information of fourier modes in the 3d spectral space .",
    "the power spectral entropy , which measures the degree of disorder of the fourier amplitudes , has previously been applied to study the onset of spatiotemporal intermittency in nonlinear models of drift waves in plasmas @xcite and in a nonlinear 3d model of a mean - field dynamo @xcite .",
    "the phase spectral entropy , which measures the degree of disorder of phase differences , has been applied in a nonlinear model of coupled oscillators @xcite and in a model of cosmological density perturbations @xcite . @xcite demonstrated the duality of the amplitude and phase synchronization in on - off spatiotemporal intermittency by applying the power and phase spectral entropies to a one - dimensional model of nonlinear long - waves .",
    "they found that , in the spatiotemporally intermittent regime , the degree of amplitude - phase synchronization is higher during the `` on '' states corresponding to coherent structures which are regular in space and chaotic in time , whereas the degree of amplitude - phase synchronization is lower during the `` off '' states associated with coherent structures which are irregular in space and time . here",

    "the bottom panel shows the time series of the fourier phase spectral entropy @xmath128 , which displays higher variability than @xmath127 .",

    "we can conclude that the embedded coherent structures in this regime are characterized by high degrees of amplitude - phase synchronization .",
    "thus , the on - off intermittency can be described as follows . in `` on '' stages , the fourier modes associated with different spatial scales adjust themselves to collective amplitude - phase synchronization , inducing bursts in the wave energy , since the mode energies are effectively superimposed . in `` off '' stages ,",
    "the synchronization is weaker and the energy becomes lower .",

    "the emergence of the two - channel flow in keplerian shear flows with a vertical background magnetic field has attracted much attention since it was observed in the numerical simulations of @xcite and later recognized as exact nonlinear solutions of the mhd equations in the theoretical work of @xcite . using a semi - analytical analysis",
    ", @xcite also demonstrated that two - channel flows are subject to secondary , `` parasitic '' instabilities with growth rates proportional to the mri .",
    "the mechanism through which the two - channel flow grows and is destroyed has been discussed by several authors @xcite . according to one scenario that is consistent with our simulations at @xmath37 , the channel mode exponentially grows from random , small - scale white noise .",
    "the amplitude of the channel mode continues to grow during several shear time units because the `` narrow box '' geometry of the spatial domain adopted in this paper can suppress the fastest - growing parasitic instabilities , which have long wavelengths in the horizontal direction @xcite . at some amplitude ,",
    "the growth of the channel mode is halted by a parasitic instability and is destroyed . presumably , the parasitic modes themselves decay into small - scale turbulence , which may then produce the seed for the random fluctuations out of which the channel flow grows @xcite .",
    "the recurrence of the patterns observed in our numerical simulations of keplerian shear flows resembles the nonlinear behaviour of dynamical systems at the onset of spatiotemporal chaos .",
    "numerical solutions of one - dimensional models of drift waves in plasmas display intermittent switching between two nonattracting coherent structures known as chaotic saddles @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior was reported in numerical simulations of nonlinear mhd dynamos in compressible flows @xcite .",
    "we presume that , in the context of dynamical systems , the trajectory given by the numerical solution of the shearing - box equations with small - scale noise as initial conditions approaches a region of the phase space dominated by the channel mode , and then escapes toward a region of the phase space near a chaotic set that represents the turbulent state .",
    "this behavior can depend on the initial conditions . @xcite and @xcite derived a low - dimensional model of mri - driven turbulence and found that the phase space is dominated by three fixed points : a stable fixed point that represents a `` turbulent '' state , a stable fixed point that represents a `` quiet '' state , and an unstable fixed point that separates the basins of attraction of the `` turbulent '' and `` quiet '' states .",
    "they compared their reduced model with 3d simulations of shear flows , and found that their model can predict the final state of the shearing - box simulations . on - off",
    "intermittency is a common phenomenon of dynamical systems , and a detailed analysis of the simulations presented here employing a dynamical systems approach to understand the mechanism responsible for the recurrent patterns observed will be the topic of future work .",
    "the fourier phase spectral entropy defined in this paper is computed using phase differences between adjacent modes ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq_deltaphikx ] ) and ( [ eq_deltaphikz ] ) ) , which means that it is restricted to local interactions between scales",
    ". the transfer of energy in mhd turbulence can be non - local @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to modify eqs .",
    "( [ eq_deltaphikx ] ) and ( [ eq_deltaphikz ] ) to take into account non - local interactions between fourier modes .",
    "for example , in the particular case of mhd turbulence in keplerian shear flows with a background magnetic field , the faster - growing parasitic instabilities have large horizontal wavelengths , which correspond to small values of @xmath64 and @xmath68 , thus one can identify the parasitic modes in fourier space and modify the definition of the fourier phase entropy to compute the phase differences between the channel modes and the parasitic modes , directly quantifying their synchronization .",
    "in summary , in this paper we applied the fourier power and phase spectral entropies to quantify the degree of amplitude - phase synchronization due to multiscale interactions in a three - dimensional model of magnetized keplerian shear flows .",
    "we have defined carefully the fourier power and phase spectral entropies for 3d fields , and the phase differences between neighbouring modes in the presence of shearing boundary conditions .",
    "then , we focused on two different values of @xmath36 .",
    "the first regime ( @xmath36 = 30 ) is characterized by turbulent patterns that self - organize , leading to the recurrent formation of two - channel flows .",
    "we showed that two - channel flows are characterized by null values of the fourier power and phase spectral entropies , which reflects the single - mode ordered state of their spatiotemporal patterns . in the second regime ( @xmath36 = 100 )",
    "the coherent structures are characterized by several fourier modes and have more difficulty to stabilize once they emerge from the turbulent background .",
    "their breaking mechanism is qualitatively different from the @xmath37 case .",
    "their formation is again related to low values of fourier power and phase spectral entropies , but since there is more than a single mode involved in the dynamics of the coherent structures , this result indicates an increase of amplitude - phase synchronization of modes during the `` on '' stages of the on - off intermittency .",
    "conversely , a loss of synchronization is responsible for the breaking of the structures and the beginning of the `` off '' stages .",
    "the fourier power spectral entropy and the fourier phase spectral entropy , as defined in eqs .",
    "( [ eq_ska ] ) and ( [ eq_sphi ] ) respectively , can be useful to quantify the degree of amplitude - phase synchronization due to multiscale interactions . on - off",
    "intermittency is a phenomenon present in a wide range of complex systems , including numerical simulations of the solar dynamo @xcite , spherical couette dynamos @xcite and pulsar magnetospheres @xcite .",
    "therefore , the techniques described in this work can be readily applied to the investigation of other turbulent systems relevant to space and astrophysical plasmas .",
