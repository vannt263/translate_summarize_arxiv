    "string theory is widely believed to offer the possibility of unifying gravity and the other interactions at the quantum level @xcite . in modern approaches ,",
    "gravity is mediated by closed strings while gauge interactions are mediated by open strings , that represent the low - energy excitations of d - branes @xcite .",
    "scenarios with large extra dimensions and low scale string tension are viable but many problems related to supersymmetry breaking and moduli stabilization are still open and call for the introduction of internal fluxes and non - perturbative effects associated to euclidean branes @xcite .",
    "aim of this lecture is to give a pedagogical introduction to d - brane instanton effects in vacuum configurations with open and unoriented strings .",
    "we will start with the adhm construction of yang - mills instantons @xcite and describe how it finds an intuitive almost natural embedding in open string theories @xcite .",
    "we then pass to consider the two broad classes of d - brane instantons : ` gauge ' instantons and ` exotic ' instantons @xcite .",
    "the former correspond to ed - branes wrapping the same cycle as a physical stack of d - branes .",
    "the latter correspond to ed - branes wrapping a cycle not wrapped by any physical stack of d - branes .",
    "for definiteness we will start with the simplest case : ed(-1)-branes ( or ` d - instantons ' ) on a stack of d3-branes .",
    "we then pass to consider quiver gauge theories governing the low - energy dynamics of ( unoriented ) d - branes at an orbifold singularity .",
    "we will review in some detail the case @xmath2 with both unoriented @xmath3-projections and sketch the derivation of the non - perturbative super potentials of the vy - ads type ( generated by ` gauge instantons ' ) and of the ` exotic ' type ( generated by ` stringy ' instantons ) @xcite .",
    "we highlight the role of the super - moduli and of the anomalous u(1 ) symmetries .",
    "we also briefly address other cases with different amount of supersymmetry and/or different structure of fermonic zero - modes that determine the nature of the instanton effect ( superpotential @xcite , threshold correction to gauge kinetic function @xcite , higher - derivative term @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "finally we discuss a toy model based on the @xmath4 quiver theory with gauge group @xmath5 where dynamical supersymmetry breaking is triggered by the combined effects of ` gauge ' instantons and a non - vanishing fi term for the first @xmath6 @xcite .",

    "as we will momentarily see , they can be nicely interpreted as the bosonic massless modes of open strings in a d@xmath42 ed@xmath43 brane system .",

    "we will therefore display how and why one should expect gauge instantons in ( super ) yang  mills theory to be implemented in string theory as systems of d - branes .",

    ", the contribution from a localized source of @xmath53 within the d@xmath42 brane would read @xmath54 , hence sourcing an instanton contribution .",
    "this suggests that gauge instantons can be described as bound states of @xmath55 d@xmath42 branes and @xmath12 ed@xmath43 branes wrapping the same cycle in internal space .",
    "if the two cycles are different , one obtains a contribution from the euclidean branes wrapping a cycle @xmath56 of the form @xmath57 , with @xmath58 not directly related to the gauge coupling .",
    "this are ` stringy ' or ` exotic ' instantons , whose importance will be discussed later on .      a good starting point to discuss gauge instantons in string theory",

    ", one should now reconstruct their equations of motion from string theory .",
    "it can be shown that string amplitudes on the disk , with the insertion of only the non - dynamical adhm moduli and their superpartners , reproduce their action .",

    "indeed , the instanton partition function reads : @xmath107      depending of the number of supersymmetries and the structure of the fermionic zero - modes , instantons can generate different kinds of non - perturbative effects .",
    "for instance , in @xmath108 theories in @xmath109 they contribute to correlation functions of more than three cpo operators , while in @xmath110 theories in @xmath109 they correct the holomorphic pre - potential .    in @xmath111 theories in @xmath109 ,",
    "non - perturbative corrections to the superpotential may arise , provided the integration over instanton moduli space yield the chiral superspace measure .",

    "this factor compensates the scaling of the moduli space integral .",
    "a superpotential is generated if and only if the integral over the instanton moduli space reduces to a chiral integral over @xmath115 superspace , with @xmath116 and the grassman variable @xmath117 coming from @xmath118 .",
    "this means that we need _ two _ exact ( unlifted ) fermionic zero - modes @xmath117 . for ` gauge ' instanton , integration over the bosonic moduli @xmath119 and @xmath120 yields negative powers of the dynamical fields and the superpotential takes the form of veneziano ",

    "the counting of the fermionic zero modes can be done relying on index theorems . in order to have a superpotential contribution",
    "the difference between the number of gaugino zero - modes and matter fermion zero - modes must be two : @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the dynkin index of the representation @xmath126 .",
    "as previously mentioned , euclidean d@xmath127 branes wrapping cycles @xmath128 different from the ones wrapped by the physical d@xmath42 branes source effects that scale as @xmath129 , .",
    "the prototype configuration is the ed@xmath130 d9 system , with 8 mixed neumann",
    " dirichlet directions ( as opposed to the 4 mixed directions in the ed@xmath43 d@xmath42 case ) .",
    "as they scale differently than standard gauge instantons , they also source field configurations that do not satisfy self - duality conditions .",
    "they may rather admit a field theory description in terms of octonionic instantons or hyper - instantons with @xmath131 .",
    "these exotic or stringy non - perturbative effects can provide contributions to the effective action that can neither be generated at the perturbative level nor by standard gauge instantons .",
    "in particular , the ` thumb rule ' for instantons to generate corrections to the superpotential is the presence of precisely two exact unlifted fermionic zero - modes needed to produce the chiral superspace measure .",
    "index theorems are useless in this case because ` exotic ' instantons do not admit a simple field theory description . as they arise from branes wrapping cycles different from the ones wrapped by physical branes , stringy instantons generally lack bosonic zero - modes in the charged sector ( such as @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) . as a result , when they contribute to the superpotential they give rise to positive powers of the fields , produced by integration over the charged grassmannian moduli .",
    "` exotic ' instanton contributions will be of the schematic form : @xmath132 such terms clearly display a very different behaviour with respect to standard instantons , as they grow for large vev s of the scalars .",
    "this would seem contradictory for gauge instantons , as asymptotic freedom suggests that these contributions should damp out for large values of the fields .",
    "however we already stressed that the scale of exotic instantons is not directly related to @xmath7 , so that a different behaviour is acceptable .",
    "examples of phenomenological interest where stringy instantons yield otherwise inaccessible contributions and couplings are : top - mass yukawa coupling in u(5 ) ( supersymmetric ) grand unified theories , the mssm @xmath133term , right - handed ( s)neutrino mass terms and other that are forbidden in string perturbation theory by anomalous u(1 ) s @xcite . combining the two kinds non - perturbative superpotentials , ads - like and exotic , one can achieve ( partial ) moduli stabilization and supersymmetry breaking .",
    "moreover , exotic contributions can help relaxing the tension between moduli stabilization and chirality @xcite .",
    "when extra zero - modes are present ( e.g. for different values of @xmath12 ) , the instanton will not contribute to the superpotential , but it could lead to threshold corrections to gauge kinetic functions or higher - derivative terms .",
    "one should not forget that the counting is influenced by the presence of fluxes , both in the open and in the closed string sectors , which can lift some zero modes and hence change the nature of the effect generated by a d - brane instanton @xcite .",
    "a wide and interesting class of gauge theories is obtained when considering stacks of d branes at an orbifold singularity .",
    "these models combined with an unoriented projection yield indeed a promising set of theories with interesting phenomenological applications , which also allow non - perturbative effects to be computed .",
    "we consider the case of a @xmath134 singularity , with @xmath135 a discrete subgroup of @xmath136 .",
    "we will focus on @xmath137 for simplicity .",
    "putting a stack of @xmath55 d branes sitting at the orbifold point , these branes must be reorganized in stacks of @xmath138 `` fractional '' branes , so that @xmath139 with @xmath140 , reflecting the irreducible representations of the orbifold group .",

    "the orbifold projection will break supersymmetry to @xmath150 or 1 .",
    "the vector in @xmath109 is not directly affected by the @xmath143 action on the internal space coordinates , but the action on the chan  paton indices remains , so that @xmath151 here @xmath61 indices are grouped in their conjugacy classes .",

    "f - terms are easily obtained from the tree - level super potential @xmath236    a counting of the fermionic zero - modes for this theory shows that no gauge instanton corrections to the superpotential can arise . however , such effects can appear in a less direct way , when the theory is in an appropriate regime .",
    "note moreover that no exotic instanton effects do affect the superpotential @xcite .",
    "including fayet ",
    "iliopoulos terms , the d - terms read @xmath237 for @xmath238 there is an @xmath239 preserving solution to both f- and d - flatness conditions , which defines a perturbative supersymmetric vacuum of the theory , obtained by taking all vev s to vanish except for the @xmath240 singlet : @xmath241 the superpotential produces a mass term @xmath242 for @xmath243 and @xmath244 , that therefore decouple for large @xmath245 .",
    "the low energy tree - level superpotential reads @xmath246 .",
    "the resulting theory is a @xmath247 gauge theory with 2 generations of matter in the @xmath248 and @xmath249 representations ( plus two color singlets ) .",
    "what is interesting is that now an effective superpotential can arise from gauge instantons .",
    "indeed , the counting of fermionic zero - modes from a @xmath52 @xmath247 instanton is @xmath250 .",
    "the exact form of the gauge instanton correction to the superpotential is also completely fixed by the symmetries of the theory @xmath251 here the matching of the scales of the two theories gives @xmath252 .",
    "the new index @xmath253 runs over the 2 remaining massless combinations of the @xmath180 fields . taking into account this non - perturbative correction , the effective @xmath247 theory",
    "no longer admits a solution to both f- and d - flatness conditions , so that supersymmetry is dynamically broken by the instanton effect .",
    "it is very interesting to see how one can recover the same results in the strong coupling description @xcite . in this case , the appropriate degrees of freedom are @xmath254 `` color '' singlets : the @xmath6 factors are anomalous and at any rate decouple at low energy . introducing an index @xmath255 , one can construct `` mesons '' and `` baryons '' : @xmath256 note that now the flavour symmetry is apparently extended to @xmath257 , although only a diagonal @xmath258 is preserved by the superpotential .",
    "the fields in satisfy the algebraic relations @xmath259 the term @xmath260 arises at the quantum level and is absent at tree level .",
    "it represents a quantum deformation of the moduli space .",
    "note that it could not appear in the first relation since the terms there have the ` wrong ' dimension : 7 instead of 10 .",
    "one can rewrite the superpotential by adding lagrange multipliers @xmath17 and @xmath261 to enforce the constraints @xmath262 turning on a vev for the singlet field @xmath263and integrating out the massive fields , one is left with @xmath264 and @xmath265 , together with the color singlets @xmath266 .",
    "they match the number of degrees of freedom of the weak coupling description , namely @xmath267 , where subtraction is due to @xmath254 gauge invariance .",
    "the resulting superpotential takes the form @xmath268 , hence matching the ads correction of the effective theory .",
    "again , we conclude that supersymmetry is dynamically broken .    another way to see this result relies on the konishi anomaly .",
    "one starts by considering a correlator in the microscopic weakly coupled theory that is corrected by instanton effects . in the case at hand",
    ", it has the schematic form @xmath269 , since the ten scalars soak up two fermionic zero modes each and hence saturate the counting of 20 fermionic zero - modes of the full theory for a @xmath52 instanton . written in terms of for gauge invariance",
    ", one has @xmath270 note that the correlator is independent of the insertion points and hence effectively factorizes .",
    "one can then use the konishi anomaly relations @xcite : @xmath271 by taking @xmath272 and @xmath273 and the vev s @xmath274 and noting that the left hand side of vanishes unless supersymmetry is broken and @xmath275 is the goldstino , we have @xmath276 which guarantees the presence of a gaugino condensate @xmath277 .",
    "now , taking with @xmath278 we see that @xmath279 in the low energy theory where massive fields have been integrated out , which means that the left hand side must be nonvanishing .",
    "therefore supersymmetry is dynamically broken and we identify the goldstino with @xmath280 .",
    "let us conclude with an outlook and draw some directions for future work on the subject .",
    "we hope we have convinced the reader that d - brane instantons ( ed - branes ) can produce interesting non - perturbative effects in vacuum configurations with open and unoriented strings .",
    "as we have shown , there are two broad classes of ed - branes : ` gauge ' instantons and ` exotic ' instantons .",
    "the former provide a very elegant way of embedding the adhm construction in string theory .",
    "the latter are genuinely stringy in nature . depending on the amount of supersymmetry and the structure of fermionic zero - modes",
    ", ed - branes can produce non - perturbative super - potentials , threshold corrections to gauge kinetic functions or to higher - derivative terms , etc .",
    "they can in particular contribute to moduli stabilization and supersymmetry breaking in conjunction with internal fluxes and fi d - terms .",
    "we have neither explored the interplay with world - sheet and ns5-brane instantons , resulting from various string dualities , nor the holographic description in various contexts that could shed light on multi - instanton effects and other subtle properties of ed - branes , such as the role of world - volume fluxes .",
    "although there is still a long way to go , we believe the basic rules of the game are set for future investigation .",
