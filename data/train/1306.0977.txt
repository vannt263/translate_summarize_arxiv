    "combining several experimental measurements , such as resistivity , hall effect , magnetic susceptibility , specific heat and neutron scattering , liu et al.@xcite determined the phase diagram of fe@xmath12(te@xmath2se@xmath3 for se concentration ranging from un - doped to optimally doped .",
    "although zero transport resistance was observed for all se concentrations , both specific heat and susceptibility measurements revealed that the bulk superconductivity does not occur until @xmath13 0.3 and the maximum t@xmath14  14 k is obtained for @xmath15 0.50  @xcite .",
    "it was also found that with se doping , the ( @xmath10,0 ) magnetic correlations are suppressed and the ( @xmath10,@xmath10 ) magnetic resonance was observed in the superconducting state for the samples that show bulk superconductivity .",
    "therefore , because iron pnictides also show superconductivity close to @xmath16 magnetic instabilities , the pairing mechanism in fe@xmath1(te@xmath2se@xmath3 may very likely be the same as in the feas - based compounds .",
    "however , the symmetry and the structure of the superconducting gap(s ) , which are intimately related to the pairing mechanism , are still debated both in the feas and , perhaps even more so , in the fe chalcogenide materials .",

    "the behavior of the superfluid density is strongly affected by the choice of @xmath82 .",
    "contrary to other fe - based superconductors , previous reports of @xmath82 in fe@xmath1(te@xmath2se@xmath3 found very similar values for different values of @xmath4 and do not suggest a systematic evolution with se concentration @xcite .",
    "we calculated @xmath81 for two extreme values of @xmath82 reported in literature i.e. 430 nm and 560 nm from ref . and ref . respectively .",
    "similar to previous work  @xcite on mgb@xmath89 , we consider the popular two - gap fit @xmath90 , where @xmath91 are the superfluid density of the gap @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively and @xmath94 represents the relative contribution of the gaps  @xcite . as it can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , apparently the fit reproduces well the experimental data , and we obtain very similar behavior for all doping levels : @xmath95 and @xmath96 , i.e. the larger gap @xmath92 contributes about 85% to the superfluid density .",
    "we also found a systematic increase of @xmath92 with se concentration , by about 40% at @xmath4=0.45 comparing with @xmath4=0.36 , while @xmath93 remained almost the same .",
    "these results are valid irrespective of the choice of @xmath82 and while they may be qualitatively meaningful , there are serious issues with the fitting model .",
    "first , we mention that in all cases , both values of the gap resulted in lower than the bcs weak - coupling limit values of 1.76@xmath97t@xmath62 : @xmath92 was about 1@xmath97t@xmath62 and @xmath98 .",
    "as it was previously discussed , for the iron pnictide superconductors this is clear indication that the model , which assumes that both gaps have bcs temperature dependence , with the same critical temperature , is not suitable for describing the superfluid density  @xcite .",
    "second serious issue with this approach is that it fails to reproduce the experimental data at low temperature .",
    "we show two examples in the insets of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] and further mention that this was the case for the majority of samples .",
    "we return now to the low temperature behavior of @xmath0 and discuss possible implications on the structure of the superconducting gap(s ) .",
    "first , we recount that despite the effect of se substitution on the critical temperature in fe@xmath1(te@xmath2se@xmath3 , we did not find a significant evolution with se content , neither in the exponent nor in the magnitude of @xmath0 .",
    "we propose that the nearly quadratic temperature dependence of penetration depth in fe@xmath1(te@xmath2se@xmath3 can be understood in terms of the pair - breaking by magnetic fluctuations at ( @xmath10,0 ) .",
    "previous neutron scattering study  @xcite on samples from the same growth found that the ( @xmath10,0 ) antiferromagnetic fluctuations , originating from interstitial fe , persist even at the optimal doping level and freeze into cluster spin glass state at low temperature .",
    "each spin cluster nucleates around interstitial fe and involves more than 50 neighboring ions in the fe plane .",
    "it was shown recently that such ( @xmath10,0 ) magnetic correlations are sources of incoherent magnetic scattering , which gives rise to charge carrier localization in the normal state and to pair - breaking in the superconducting state  @xcite .",
