    "<S> we note that the quasicrystal is stable for a wide range of pressures . at very high pressures , </S>",
    "<S> the z phase becomes stable due to its greater density . </S>",
    "<S> the z phase is a plastic crystal , meaning that particles are able to rotate relatively freely : this is understandable , as there is no obvious preferred way to orientate a five - fold particle in a six - fold environment . no orientational ordering ensues in the z phase even at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> whether it would form an orientationally - ordered crystal or an orientational glass at sufficiently low @xmath15 is not clear . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that for the qc - z transition , @xmath28 ; since @xmath29 , the clapeyron equation implies that @xmath30 : this is likely to stem from the orientational entropy of the plastic crystal . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , in addition to the two triple points ( @xmath13-qc - z and qc - z - f ) , there is a range of pressures where the stable thermodynamic phase changes from f to z to qc to @xmath13 as the system is cooled .    </S>",
    "<S> we also look at the effect of modifying potential parameters on the phase diagram , thus allowing us to assess the extent of quasicrystal stability and how finely - tuned the particle properties would need to be to observe a quasicrystalline phase in experiment . to determine the phase diagram as the potential parameters change , we additionally use hamiltonian gibbs  </S>",
    "<S> duhem integration , whereby we numerically integrate a clapeyron equation that has been generalised to allow for changes to the potential itself @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we first investigate the behaviour of the system as the patch width is varied . from the phase diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - quasicrystal - phasediags - all](b ) , we see that the quasicrystal is only stable for a limited range of @xmath7 , although the range may perhaps be wider at other pressures . as the patch width narrows , the quasicrystal becomes increasingly enthalpically destabilised with respect to the @xmath13 phase , as the many six - fold environments can not satisfactorily fulfil patch - patch interactions . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , as the patch width increases , the quasicrystal becomes more stable with respect to the @xmath13 phase , but the hexagonal phase is stabilised even more : as the patches are wider and closer to the isotropic case , six - fold environments are enthalpically preferred .    </S>",
    "<S> another noteworthy feature of this phase diagram is that below @xmath31 , @xmath32 begins to decrease : as the patches become narrower , there is an increasing energetic penalty for patches that do not point directly at each other . </S>",
    "<S> for very narrow patches , the @xmath13 phase transforms into a distorted @xmath13 phase ( d@xmath13 ) @xcite , in which three of the five patches point directly at the patches of neighbouring particles , thus breaking the square symmetry of the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this behaviour is that at narrow patch widths , only ` perfect ' connections count , as a slight misalignment of the patches rapidly reduces the interparticle attraction , and three perfect interactions become favoured over five imperfect ones .    </S>",
    "<S> because colloidal interactions are often quite short - ranged , we also wish to investigate what happens to the system when we change the lj exponent ( @xmath26 ) , which changes the range of the potential and the width of the potential well . </S>",
    "<S> we show the phase diagram as a function of @xmath26 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - quasicrystal - phasediags - all](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of increasing @xmath26 on isotropic potentials are well understood @xcite : the liquid phase is energetically destabilised because the intrinsic disorder in interparticle neighbour distances is penalised by the narrower potential @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - quasicrystal - phasediags - all](c ) , the range of stability of the quasicrystal initially increases . </S>",
    "<S> the enthalpies of the qc and @xmath13 phases increase only slightly as @xmath26 increases , because their relative order means that most interparticle neighbour distances can be close to optimal , but do so more for the quasicrystal , as some disorder is typically present in the quasicrystal configurations ( for example , particles with unclassified environments in fig .  [ fig - quasicrystal](d ) ) ; the @xmath13-qc coexistence temperature does therefore increase slightly . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the fluid is initially much more enthalpically penalised : the fluid enthalpy increases rapidly , and the fluid density decreases as @xmath26 increases . at the maximum in @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , </S>",
    "<S> the size of the temperature window of quasicrystal stability is three times that of the @xmath4 lj potential . </S>",
    "<S> however , a narrower potential well associated with increasing @xmath26 also means that there is less vibrational entropy associated with the ordered structures , and beyond @xmath34 , this effect becomes dominant . </S>",
    "<S> the qc - f coexistence temperature decreases until the quasicrystal loses stability at @xmath35 .    </S>",
    "<S> the potential at the higher values of @xmath26 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - quasicrystal - phasediags - all](c ) is very short - ranged indeed . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the quasicrystal maintains and even increases its window of stability for ranges of attraction typical of colloidal particles suggests that this is a robust , general result and that stable quasicrystals can be expected to form in experimental realisations of this system .    </S>",
    "<S> there are several potential approaches to such experimental realisations . </S>",
    "<S> if patchy colloidal particles similar to the ones studied here could be created , it would be reasonable to expect that a quasicrystal may form when they are confined in two dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> for example , chen _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _  observed the formation of a 2d kagom lattice from tri - block janus particles by introducing a density mismatch with the solvent to confine their colloidal system into two dimensions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a possible alternative to using colloidal patchy particles might involve the use of dna multi - arm motifs @xcite , for which a variety of 2d crystalline arrays have been observed for motifs with different numbers of arms , including a @xmath13 phase for five - arm motifs that is analogous to what we see in the current model when patches are narrow . </S>",
    "<S> however , such dna motifs have a well - defined ` valence ' , and there is no equivalent of the patch width that could be tuned to make two co - ordination numbers compete . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , a possible approach to forming a dna quasicrystal might be to use a two - component mixture of five - arm and six - arm motifs of the appropriate composition .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown how we can compute if and where a quasicrystalline phase is thermodynamically stable . to the best of our knowledge , </S>",
    "<S> this is the first such calculation of the chemical potential of a quasicrystal and the associated phase diagrams that has been obtained directly from simulations with no approximations . for our patchy particle system </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the quasicrystalline phase is stable over a significant portion of the phase diagram and is stabilised primarily by its configurational entropy . </S>",
    "<S> it is robust to parameter changes in the model , which inspires confidence that such a thermodynamically stable quasicrystal might be experimentally realised .    </S>",
