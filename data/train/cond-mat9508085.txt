    "in equilibrium , the superconducting meissner phase of a bulk type - i superconducting sample exists below a thermodynamic critical field @xmath4 ( or below @xmath5 in a type - ii superconductor ) ; above this field the sample reverts to the normal phase ( or the flux lattice phase in a type - ii superconductor ) .",
    "however , because the phase transition in both cases is first - order it is possible to superheat the meissner phase and delay the transition to fields well above @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "this superheated , metastable meissner phase is eventually destroyed at a maximum superheating field @xmath1 .",
    "understanding the origin and stability of the superheated state is the first step in providing a complete description of the time - dependent collapse of the meissner phase , which is important for many applications of type - i superconductors .",
    "for instance , there have been recent proposals to use superheated type - i superconductors as detectors for elementary particles , so that the sample acts as a superconducting `` bubble chamber '' @xcite .",
    "the passage of a sufficiently energetic particle through the sample would initiate the transition to the normal state . measuring the superheating field also provides one of the few methods of experimentally determining the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath0 in type - i superconductors @xcite .",
    "the precise value of the maximum superheating field may depend upon extrinsic factors such as defects in the sample and sample preparation and geometry . if these effects can be minimized then the limit of superheating is determined by the boundaries and geometry of the sample .",
    "the simplest and most widely studied geometry is a superconducting half - space with a magnetic field applied parallel to the surface of the superconductor , which is the geometry considered in the remainder of this paper . to model",
    "the superconductor we will use the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) equations , which provide an accurate description of the surface behavior provided the coherence length @xmath6 is large compared to microscopic length scales @xcite .",
    "previous studies of superheating in type - i superconductors have used a variety of heuristic methods to determine the behavior of the gl equations near the surface .",
    "ginzburg @xcite inferred the leading @xmath7 dependence of the superheating field from the form of the ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "apparently unaware of ginzburg s work , the orsay group @xcite used a variational argument to show that @xmath8 . by combining an ingenious guess for the behavior of the superconducting order parameter near the surface with a variational calculation ,",
    "parr @xcite was able to calculate the next order correction to the orsay group s result .",
    "in addition to this analytical work there has also been a great deal of numerical work on solving the gl equations in small-@xmath0 limit @xcite , which is reviewed in ref .",
    "the numerical results appear to confirm at least some of the analytical work , although admittedly over a somewhat restricted range of @xmath0 .",
    "one deficiency common to all of the previous analytical approaches is an _ ad - hoc _ construction of approximate solutions of the gl equations , leaving us without a procedure for systematically improving upon these approximations .",
    "in addition , the issue of the _ stability _ of the solutions in the small-@xmath0 limit seems not to have been addressed rigorously ( for one attempt see @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we re - examine the problem of superheating in type - i superconductors by using the method of matched asymptotic expansions @xcite to solve the gl equations in the small-@xmath0 limit .",
    "this method was originally developed to treat boundary layer problems in fluid mechanics @xcite in a controlled and systematic fashion , and is particularly well suited to the superheating problem , as all of the technical difficulties arise due to a `` boundary layer '' at the surface . using this method we can calculate the superheating field in the small-@xmath0 limit as an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath2 , construct uniform asymptotic expansions ( i.e. , expansions valid for all @xmath9 as @xmath10 ) for the order parameter and magnetic field , determine the stability of the solutions , and treat nonlocal electrodynamic effects .",
    "where appropriate we compare our asymptotic results against numerical solutions of the gl equations , and we generally find excellent agreement . we have chosen to present our results in detail , as the methods are probably unfamiliar to most physicists .",
    "matched asymptotic expansions have recently been used by chapman @xcite to study superheating in the large-@xmath0 limit , and our results complement his work .",
    "this paper , taken together with chapman s work , demonstrates that these perturbation methods can provide a powerful calculational tool for solving problems in inhomogeneous or nonequilibrium superconductivity .",

    "a solution is sought using the result from the previous lower field solution as an initial guess .",
    "eventually a maximum value for @xmath27 is reached , above which one of two things happens : our algorithm fails to converge to a solution or it converges to the normal ( nonsuperconducting solution ) .",
