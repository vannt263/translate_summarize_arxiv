    "in  @xcite , one of us ( theobald ) considered arrangements of @xmath4 lines and @xmath5 _ spheres _ in @xmath0 having infinitely many lines simultaneously transversal to the @xmath4 lines and tangent to the @xmath5 spheres . since for generic configurations of @xmath4 lines and @xmath5 spheres there are only finitely many common transversals / tangents , the goal was to characterize the non - generic configurations where the discrete and combinatorial nature of the problem is lost .",
    "one case left open was that of two lines and two spheres .",
    "we solve that here .",
    "a second purpose is to develop and present a variety of techniques from computational algebraic geometry for tackling problems of this kind .",
    "since not all our readers are familiar with these techniques , we explain and document these techniques , with the goal of increasing their applicability . for that reason , we first deal with the more general problem where we replace the spheres in @xmath0 by general quadratic surfaces ( hereafter quadrics ) in complex projective 3-space @xmath2 . in order to study the geometry of this problem , we fix two lines and a quadric in general position , and describe the set of ( second ) quadrics for which there are infinitely many common transversals / tangents in terms of an algebraic curve .",
    "it turns out that this set is an algebraic curve of degree  24 in the space @xmath6 of quadrics .",
    "factoring the ideal of this curve shows that it is remarkably reducible :    [ thm:24 - 12 ] fix two skew lines @xmath7 and @xmath8 and a general quadric  @xmath9 in @xmath2 .",
    "the closure of the set of quadrics  @xmath10 for which there are infinitely many lines simultaneously transversal to @xmath7 and @xmath8 and tangent to both @xmath9 and to @xmath10 is a curve of degree @xmath11 in the @xmath6 of quadrics .",
    "this curve consists of @xmath12 plane conics .",
    "we prove this theorem by investigating the ideal defining the algebraic curve describing the set of ( second ) quadrics .",
    "based on this , we prove the theorem with the aid of a computer calculation in the computer algebra system singular  @xcite . as explained in section  [ se : infinitetangents ] , the success of that computation depends crucially on the preceeding analysis of the curve .",
    "quite interestingly , there are real lines @xmath7 and @xmath8 and real quadrics @xmath9 such that all 12 components of the curve of second quadrics are real . in general ,",
    "given real lines @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and a real quadric @xmath9 , not all of the 12 components are defined over the real numbers .",
    "while the beautiful and sophisticated geometry of our fundamental problem on lines and quadrics could be sufficient motivation to study this geometric problem , the original motivation came from algorithmic problems in computational geometry .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , problems of this type occur in applications where one is looking for a line or ray _ interacting _ ( in the sense of `` intersecting '' or in the sense of `` not intersecting '' ) with a given set of three - dimensional bodies , if the class of admissible bodies consists of polytopes and spheres ( respectively quadrics ) .",
    "concrete application classes of this type include visibility computations with moving viewpoints @xcite , controlling a laser beam in manufacturing @xcite , or the design of _ envelope _ data structures supporting ray shooting queries ( i.e. , seeking the first sphere , if any , met by a query ray )  @xcite . with regard to related treatments of the resulting algebraic - geometric core problems ,",
    "we refer to  @xcite . in these papers",
    ", the question of arrangements of four ( unit ) spheres in @xmath13 leading to an infinite number of common tangent lines is discussed from various viewpoints .",
    "the present paper is structured as follows : in section  [ se : plueckervisi ] , we review the well - known plcker coordinates from line geometry . in section  [ se : lines2l1q ] , we characterize the set of lines transversal to two skew lines and tangent to a quadric in terms of algebraic curves ; we study and classify these so - called @xmath14-_curves_. then , in section  [ se : infinitetangents ] , we study the set of quadrics which ( for prescribed lines @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) lead to most @xmath14-curves .",
    "this includes computer - algebraic calculations , based on which we establish the proof of theorem  [ thm:24 - 12 ] .",
    "the appendix to the paper contains annotated computer code used in the proof . in section  [ se : examples ] , we give some detailed examples illustrating the geometry described by theorem  [ thm:24 - 12 ] , and complete its proof .",
    "finally , in section  [ se : lines2l2s ] , we solve the original question of spheres and give the complete characterization of configurations of two lines and two quadrics having infinitely many lines transversal to the lines and tangent to the quadrics . for a precise statement of that characterization",
