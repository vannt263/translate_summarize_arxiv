    "although objects hosting an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) represent only a small fraction of the total number of extragalactic sources , there is growing evidence that a low level of nuclear activity is a common feature among galaxies .",

    ", the debate over the physical processes that are responsible for the `` activity '' in llagn has been a major issue in recent years .",
    "these galaxies may host a scaled down version of the more powerful agn , with an accreting super massive black hole rendered under - luminous because of a low accretion rate and/or low radiative efficiency .",

    "vla observations with arcsecond @xcite or subarcsecond @xcite resolution have successfully revealed the presence of a compact radio core in most liners and low luminosity seyferts , with the non - detections likely caused by limits in sensitivity only .",

    "this implies brightness temperatures @xmath12 k , which definitely rule out any explanation based on thermal processes , and point directly to synchrotron emission from the base of a parsec scale jet .",

    "more recent observations with the vlba at 6 cm have yielded a dramatic improvement in our knowledge of this source : @xcite reveal an extended core and an elongated region to the southeast on scales of a few milliarcsecond ; @xcite , thanks to more short spacings provided by a vla antenna in addition to the full vlba , have detect emission on the opposite side of the core as well .",
    "however , the discrepancy in the total flux density [ @xmath17 vs. @xmath18  mjy ] is more than the simple addition of a vla antenna can justify ; it is possible that the source may be variable or simply that there have been problems in the calibration of the flux density scale . @xcite",

    "we followed the same scheme for the data reduction of both 5 ghz and 8.4 ghz data - sets .",

    "we also re - analyzed vlba+y1 5 ghz data obtained in 1995 ( july 22 ) , taking advantage of the new position @xcite .",
    "the position used in the original correlation was off by more than one arcsecond from the actual position of the source .",

    "the total flux density measured in our images is 120 mjy at 5 ghz and 95 mjy at 8.4 ghz .",
    "if we compare these values with those obtained with the vla ( 162 mjy and 114 mjy , respectively , see table  [ tabvla ] ) , we find about a 20 - 25% difference , which can be ascribed to the vlba resolving out some extended emission , probably in the western region .",

    "we report the flux density at 5 and 8.4 ghz respectively , and in column 9 we compute the spectral index . besides being the most compact feature , component @xmath43 presents also the flattest spectral index ( @xmath50 ) and",
    "its identification with the core is straightforward .",
    "finally , no polarized signal is detected from our data .",
    "both the images in stokes q and u are purely noise - like , with on source @xmath51 noise levels of 66 and 63 @xmath52jy / beam at 5 ghz and of 62 and 60 mjy / beam at 8.4 ghz , respectively . based on the on - source noise in the q and u images ,",
    "we place a limit on any polarized signal for the source at @xmath53jy / beam at 5 ghz and @xmath54jy / beam at 8.4 ghz ( @xmath55 values ) . at the position of the brightest component in the total intensity images , this corresponds to a fractional polarization of @xmath56 at 5 ghz and @xmath57 at 8.4 ghz .",
    "the reprocessing of the july 1995 data has yielded a significant improvement over the previously published results .",
    "the new image ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) is in good agreement with the data taken at 5 ghz in 2000 , showing a central compact component and jet - like features in the same position angle .",
    "the overall morphology of the source is similar to that shown in @xcite and we confirm the reality of the emission coming from the northwest .",
    "however , the noise level has improved by over a factor of 6 ( 65 vs 400 @xmath52jy ) and the flux density scale is more consistent with both our new observations as well as the results presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resulting total flux density is 135 mjy .",
    "the same five component model that fits the 2000 epoch data has been applied to this data set as well , allowing for the components to change in flux density and position .",
    "the resulting fit is good ( reduced @xmath58-squared of 0.98 ) and is presented in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "uncertainties are computed in the same way as for epoch 2000.652 , and are 0.13 , 0.11 , 0.09 , and 0.56  mas for @xmath46 @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "an independent fit with only four components has also been tried , and fits the data almost as well as the five component model ( reduced @xmath58-squared of 1.00 ) : components s2 , s1 , and n2 are maintained in both models , while @xmath43 and @xmath48 can actually be fitted with one gaussian only ( @xmath59 ) . however , this model gives a less accurate representation of the core region , with the component @xmath59 too extended ( 3.2 mas @xmath35 1.3 mas ) to match the size of the compact core .",
    "we also note that if @xmath48 is removed from the model for the 2000.652 epoch data , any following iteration of the fitting algorithm will reintroduce it at the expense of @xmath46 .",
    "if we compare data taken at the same frequency in different epochs , we can get information on the evolution of the source .",
    "a first comparison can be made by directly overlaying the contours at the same frequency from the two epochs ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) . before overlaying them",
    ", we have convolved the two images with the same restoring beam .",
    "we also plot the same contours , regardless of the lower noise level of the 2000.652 image .",
    "this guarantees that any difference is due to a real change in the source structure and not simply to the better sensitivity of one observation .",
    "the overlay is suggestive of a displacement of the northwest low level emission , moving away from the core .",
    "minor differences can be seen also in the core region and in the southeastern jet . in general ,",
    "the blue 2000.652 contours trace the emission in a region more extended than the red 1995.551 ones .",
    "this behavior can be better quantified if we consider the relative motion of the components identified by the modelfit process .",
    "taking the position of the core ( component @xmath43 ) as a reference , and assuming it is fixed , we have compared the position of the other components .",
    "we report the results in table  [ tab4 ] : column ( 1 ) labels the components , columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) give the relative motion over the five years in polar coordinates ( distance in mas , angle in degrees ) ; columns ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) report the apparent velocity in mas  yr@xmath16 and units of @xmath60 , respectively ; finally , the corresponding kinematic age is given in column ( 6 ) .",
    "the radial distance of each component has increased over the five years lag between the observations .",
    "the motion is larger on the northwestern side ; in particular , the largest displacement is found for component @xmath49 .",
    "the corresponding apparent velocities are given in column  ( 5 ) , with the fastest component moving at @xmath61 .",
    "assuming that the apparent velocity is constant for each component , we derive ages as reported in column  ( 6 ) . @xmath46 and @xmath49 have ages that are consistent , and they could have been ejected together about 25 years before epoch 2000.652 .",
    "@xmath47 is the oldest component , and its counterpart in the main jet is not detected , probably because it is too distant and extended .",
    "finally , @xmath48 is the youngest component , ejected only three years before our first epoch of observations ; it is likely that a corresponding component @xmath62 has emerged in the counterjet but is still confused with the core .",
    "note that the core is the only component whose flux density is larger in 2000.652 than in 1995.551 .",
    "finally , we can compare the total flux density detected in the two epochs .",
    "our data indicate a variation of the total flux density of about 10% , with the source being less powerful in the second epoch .",
    "note that @xcite report a value of 87.3 mjy ; however , that observation was performed _ without _",
    "the addition of a vla antenna , which results in a lack of short spacings sensitive to low level emission . as a consequence , component @xmath49 and ( partly )",
    "@xmath47 are resolved out , accounting for the difference in total flux density .",
    "we now compare data taken at the same epoch but with different frequencies , in particular we present the map of the spectral index from 2000 august 27 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the features of the spectral index map are in agreement with the single component values determined by the model - fit .",
    "the core region presents the flattest spectrum ( @xmath63 ) , steepening along the southern jet ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "an irregular spectral index pattern is found in regions with lower level emission , such as the outermost edge of the southern jet and the extended northern component n2 .",
    "however , we can still determine an average spectrum for this region , which has @xmath65 .    in fig .",
    "[ figvla ] we also plot the simultaneous spectrum taken with the vla in a configuration from 1.4 ghz to 43 ghz .",
    "the measured flux densities are reported in table  [ tabvla ] .",
    "the best - fit power - law spectral index is @xmath8 .",
    "our images detect low level emission to the northwest of ngc  4278 with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity .",
    "we find , in the inner part of the jet , a compact component n3 , and at a larger distance , @xmath66 mjy of flux density in the region n2 .",
    "thus , we classify ngc  4278 as a two - sided source , similarly to a few other llagn previously studied , e.g. ngc  4552 @xcite , ngc  6500 @xcite , and ngc  3894 @xcite .    we are therefore faced with the puzzle of determining which of the jets is pointing toward us and the direction of the source main axis with respect to the line - of - sight .",
    "although the southern jet looks more collimated , the total flux density is larger in the northern components than in the southern ones .",
    "the high resolution 8.4 ghz image ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) clearly shows that the inner jet is brighter to the north than to the south .",
    "the apparent motion of the northern components are also larger than those of the southern ones .",
    "finally , the 43 ghz image in @xcite shows a hint of emission only to the northwest of the core on scales @xmath67 1 mas .",
    "we therefore argue that the main , approaching jet is the northern one .      to estimate the orientation @xmath68 and intrinsic velocity @xmath69 of the jet , we initially consider a simple beaming model , which assumes that pairs of components are ejected simultaneously from the core with the same intrinsic velocity and brightness .",
    "we apply this model to the component pair @xmath49/@xmath46 , which has been ejected simultaneously according to our motion measurements (   [ motion ] ) , and we further assume that @xmath49 is the one on the approaching side . in this model , the ratio between the arm length @xmath70 and the proper motion @xmath52 of the two components are related by    @xmath71    from our modelfits we derive that @xmath72 and @xmath73 , so we estimate that @xmath74 .",
    "the arm length ratio corresponds to selecting the hatched area between the two solid lines in the @xmath75-plane shown in fig .",
    "the dot - dash lines represent the possible combination of @xmath69 and @xmath68 resulting from the apparent separation velocity of the two components , which is expressed by the relation @xmath76 .",
    "finally , since we measure motion on both sides and we know the source distance , we can directly solve for @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; this corresponds to the dashed ellipse centered on @xmath77 , @xmath78 .    in principle",
    ", one could also consider the brightness ratio between the two components ; however , as an effect of relativistic time dilation , we are watching the components at different stages of evolution .",
    "since we know little about the time evolution of the jet components , this hinders the application of the brightness ratio constraint ; in any case , a check that @xmath79 is possible and is consistent with our interpretation .    based on the above analysis ( fig .",
    "[ bt ] ) , we find mildly relativistic velocities of @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) , and an orientation close to the line - of - sight ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the resultant doppler factor is @xmath83 and the small viewing angle explains the bends visible in both jets as the amplification caused by projection effects of intrinsically small deviations , which are common in high power radio sources .      as an alternate explanation to that proposed above , it is possible that the true radio morphology of ngc 4278 is influenced by more than relativistic beaming .",
    "for example , there may be significant interactions between the jet and the surrounding medium .",
    "this could explain the lower velocity for the components in the southern side of the jet and cause the flux density of @xmath47 to be enhanced . if this is the case , the task of identifying corresponding pairs of components either side of the core becomes confused .",
    "the radio source could then be oriented at a larger angle to the line - of - sight than we deduce from beaming arguments . in this scenario ,",
    "the large bends visible in our images would be real and not amplified by geometrical effects , suggesting a strong interaction of the jets with the surrounding medium . the combination of a strong interaction with a dense medium and a low power core could well account for the small size of ngc  4278 .",
    "it is unlikely , in any case , that more than mildly relativistic velocities are present in the jet of ngc  4278 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xcite have detected compact cores in llagns almost exclusively in type 1 objects . among the possible explanations , they invoke the unified scheme , assuming that all llagns have accreting black holes and that we only see radio emission in type 1 objects because of beaming and/or obscuration .",
    "our resulting viewing angle determined in  [ doppler ] seems to support this picture ; however , the lorentz factor is not as high as in more powerful classic radio galaxies , where @xmath84 @xcite",
    ". therefore , a source similar to ngc  4278 but oriented at @xmath85 , would have a similar doppler factor @xmath86 , hence still be detectable .",
    "we note that if llagns have low lorentz factor ( i.e. @xmath87 ) , the doppler factor does not depend strongly on the viewing angle and we should be able to see also sources oriented at large @xmath68 .",
    "the lack of raido cores in type 2 llagn then may require alternative explanations such as free - free absorption by a torus .      from the result of the modelfit , small to moderate apparent velocities ( @xmath4 )",
    "are found for the four jet components . under the assumption of constant velocity",
    ", we derive that these components must have been ejected from the core between 8.3 and 65.8 years before epoch 2000.652 ( see column [ 6 ] in table  [ tab4 ] ) .    however , these jet components are not to be confused with the hot spots demarcating the end of the jet as found in more powerful csos @xcite .",
    "therefore , a kinematic estimate of the real age of the source is not possible , and that of @xmath47 can only be taken as a lower limit .",
    "the low brightness and large size of @xmath49 , as well as the non - detection of @xmath88 , suggest that components are continually ejected from the core , but soon disrupt , without being able to travel long distances and form kiloparsec - scale lobes .",
    "we do not expect that this source will evolve into a kiloparsec - scale radio galaxy , but rather that it will only periodically inflate slowly , as visible in fig .",
    "the relatively low velocity jets discussed in   [ jets ] can not bore through the local ism and escape , as demonstrated by the lack of hot spots which are prevalent in higher power csos .",
    "this behavior can be ascribed to a low power central engine , which can not create highly relativistic jets .    in fig .",
    "[ lightcurve ] we plot the flux density history for ngc  4278 at 6 cm using data taken at the westerbork synthesis radio telescope , the green bank 300  ft radio telescope and the vla .",
    "a previous light curve was published by @xcite , to which we add 12 points , from observations obtained between 1972 and 2003 .",
    "the light curve shows that the radio source is variable , prone to both outbursts and low states .",
    "a burst is certainly present around 1985 , while in more recent years the source has been showing less activity .",
    "it is difficult to connect the burst with the ejection of new components , both because of the uncertainties related to the age of a single component , and the possible time lag between component ejection and total flux density enhancement .",
    "it is clear however that the source presents a high degree of variability , most likely related to the presence of an active nucleus .",
    "this is an interesting result , suggesting that repeated observations of other llagn are desirable , given that few studies on this topic exist so far @xcite .",
    "thanks to its proximity , ngc  4278 makes an excellent laboratory to study the properties of llagns and to explore the nature of the physical processes taking place . in particular , there are three important clues for solving the puzzle over the origin of the radio emission : ( 1 ) the shape of the radio spectrum ; ( 2 ) the parsec - scale morphology , and ( 3 ) the brightness temperature of the vlbi core .    in 7 nearby galaxies studied by @xcite ,",
    "adaf models are unsuccessful in fitting the high frequency radio spectra , and synchrotron radiation from non - thermal particles in jets must contribute significantly .",
    "conversely , @xcite have revealed in six llagn vlba spectral indexes that are remarkably flat or even slowly rising up to 43 ghz .",
    "although these cores are still too luminous to be explained in terms of only radiation from an adaf , the jet properties remain to be determined and successfully imaged in these sources .    in our case",
    ", the overall vla spectrum can be fit by a power - law with an intermediate index @xmath8 ( see  [ spix ] ) . a possible steepening occurs above 22 ghz , which argues against the presence of an adaf as significantly contributing to the total emissivity .",
    "a low frequency flattening / turnover may be present around 408 mhz , with @xmath89 mjy @xcite and @xmath90 mjy @xcite . variability and resolution effects are also important in the study of the spectrum of this source and other agn  for example , the flux density from the low brightness northwestern region was missed by @xcite , resulting in a flatter high - frequency spectral index . in any case , the radio spectrum between 151 mhz and 43 ghz is globally similar to that of more powerful radio loud agn , i.e. to that of synchrotron emission from relativistic particles in a jet .    at higher frequencies , ngc",
    "4278 possesses an optical central compact core which lies nicely at the low power end of the correlation between optical and radio core luminosity in fr  i radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "this correlation can be interpreted in terms of a common non - thermal synchrotron origin , with the radiation being produced in relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "the parsec - scale morphology revealed by our vlba images is clearly in agreement with this scenario , showing twin jets .",
    "this result and the high brightness temperature @xmath91 k are in agreement with similar findings from @xcite ; therefore , we conclude that the emission from ngc  4278 and from similar llagns originates in radio jets via the synchrotron process",
    ".    in this scenario , detection of polarized signals would be an interesting signature of the synchrotron process ; indeed , vla observations at 8.4 ghz have found weak linear polarization in ngc  4278 at a level of 0.34% and in other llagn , although the detection rates and percentage of linear polarization in these sources are lower than in more powerful agns @xcite .",
    "our new polarization data for ngc  4278 show that it is unpolarized on milliarcsecond scales , as also found by @xcite .",
    "this could be due to limits in sensitivity .",
    "since synchrotron radiation is expected to have an intrinsically high percentage of linear polarization , one needs to invoke a significant amount of faraday depolarization , or some other effect , to explain the low amount of linear polarization observed .",
    "note that low or absent linear polarization is a characteristic of csos @xcite , although recent observations have found exceptions to this rule @xcite .    finally , it is interesting to discuss the position of the central black hole responsible for the accretion and launch of the jets .",
    "our observations allow us to image the nuclear region of ngc  4278 on scales of @xmath92 pc ( 1 mas = 0.071 pc ) . based on the correlation between the black hole mass and the central velocity dispersion",
    ", we can estimate @xmath93 for ngc  4278 .",
    "the relation takes the form @xmath94 , where @xmath95  km  s@xmath16 @xcite and @xmath96  km  s@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it follows that @xmath97 and that the schwarzschild radius @xmath98 pc ; therefore , our images probe scales of some @xmath99 .",
    "we present new vlba and vla data for the nearby ( @xmath100 mpc ) llagn ngc  4278 .",
    "our new vlba data show a two - sided emission on sub - parsec scales in the form of twin jets emerging from a central compact component ( @xmath91 k ) , in a similar way to that seen in more powerful radio loud agns . in agreement with this",
    ", the spectral index distribution for the radio source reveals a flat spectrum core region with steep spectrum jets on either side .    by comparison with previous observations ,",
    "we discover proper motion for components in both jets over a five years time baseline .",
    "we find low apparent velocities ( @xmath4 ) for the jet components and estimate the epoch of their ejection as @xmath101 years prior to our observations .",
    "based on our analysis , we suggest that the north - west side is the approaching side , and that the jets of ngc  4278 are mildly relativistic with @xmath69 @xmath102 0.75 .",
    "the central black hole in ngc  4278 is active and able to produce jets , which are responsible for the bulk of the emission at radio to optical frequencies in this llagn .",
    "however , the lifetime of the components of @xmath103 years at the present epoch , combined with the lack of large scale emission , suggests that the jets are disrupted before they reach kiloparsec scales .",
    "the study of the flux density history at 6 cm between 1972 and 2003 shows significant variability ( @xmath104 ) on time scales of a few years , which might be related to the ejection of new components .",
    "this subject needs to be explored for other llagns as well , as it can give insights into the state of the central black hole in these sources .",
