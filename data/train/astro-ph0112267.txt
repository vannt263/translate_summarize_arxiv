    "dwarf novae ( dn ) systems contain a white dwarf ( wd ) accreting matter at time - averaged rates @xmath3 from a low - mass ( @xmath4 typically ) stellar companion . at these @xmath2 s ,",
    "the accretion disk is subject to a thermal instability which causes it to rapidly transfer matter onto the wd ( at @xmath5 ) for a few days to a week once every month to year .",
    "the orbital periods of these binaries are usually less than 2 hours ( below the period gap ) , but there are also dn above the period gap , @xmath6 3 hours ( see shafter 1992 ) .",
    "the @xmath7 onto the wd can be low enough between outbursts that the optical / uv emission is dominated by the internal luminosity of the wd , not the accretion disk .",
    "recent hst / stis spectroscopy has spectrally resolved the wd s contribution to the quiescent light and found effective temperatures @xmath8 ( see our figure [ fig : lars ] and sion 1999 ) .    the measured internal wd luminosity is larger than expected from an isolated wd of similar age ( @xmath9 gyr ) , indicating that it has been heated by accretion ( sion 1985 ) .",
    "compressional heating ( i.e. internal gravitational energy release ) appears to be the main driver for this re - heating ( sion 1995 ) .",
    "sion s ( 1995 ) early estimate for internal gravitational energy release within the wd ( of mass @xmath10 and radius @xmath11 ) was @xmath12 .",
    "however , we show in  2 that most energy is released in the accreted outer envelope , giving @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mean molecular weight of the accreted material , @xmath15 is the baryon mass , and @xmath16 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "the theoretical challenge that we address in  3 is how to calculate the wd core temperature , @xmath17 , as a function of @xmath2 , and thus find @xmath18 . because of the unstable nuclear burning and resulting classical novae cycle , the envelope mass changes with time",
    "this allows the core to cool at low accumulated masses and be heated prior to unstable ignition .",
    "we use nova ignition to determine the maximum mass of the overlying freshly accreted shell , and find the steady - state ( i.e. cooling equals heating throughout the classical novae cycle ) deep interior temperature of the accreting wd , @xmath17 , as a function of @xmath2 and wd mass .    in  4",
    ", we compare our theoretical work to stis observations and infer @xmath2 on the timescale of @xmath19 years , critical to constraining cv evolutionary models .",
    "figure [ fig : lars ] shows that dn above the period gap are hotter than those below the gap , and have @xmath2 s consistent with that expected from traditional cv evolution ( e.g. howell et al .",
    "2001 ) , even those that involve some `` hibernation '' ( shara et al . 1986 ; kolb et al .",
    "the result is more surprising if the much weaker magnetic braking laws of andronov et .",
    "( 2001 ) are correct .",
    "we also predict the minimum light ( @xmath20 ) of @xmath21 cvs in quiescence , allowing for discovery of the predicted large population of cvs with very low mass companions ( @xmath22 ) that are near the period minimum ( howell et al . 1997 ) .",
    "observations already show that the wd fixes the quiescent colors of these cvs and our calculations are useful for surveys in the field that were discussed at this meeting ( e.g. 2df , sdss , see marsh et al .",
    "2001 and szkody et al .",
    "2001 contributions here ) , as well as hst cv searches in globular clusters .",
    "it is important to make clear what is meant by internal gravitational energy release or compressional heating _ within the white dwarf .",
    "_ most are familiar with the energy released ( @xmath23 ) when a baryon falls from a large distance to the stellar surface .",
    "this energy is deposited at , or near , the photosphere and is rapidly radiated away .",
    "this energy does not get taken into the star , as in the upper atmosphere ( where @xmath24 ) the time it takes the fluid to move inward is always much longer ( by a factor of at least @xmath25 ) than the time it takes for heat to escape .",
    "thus , once accretion has shut off , or diminished ( such as in dn quiescence ) , this energy release is no longer relevant .",
    "what is relevant is energy release deep in the wd due to compression by the freshly accreted material and hydrostatic nuclear burning . that energy takes a long time to exit , will still be visible when accretion has halted , and sets @xmath18 in quiescence .",
    "let s start with the simplest view of compressional heating . in the non - degenerate outer atmosphere , the fluid is slowly falling down in the wd gravitational field ,",
    "a fluid element falls a distance of order the scale height , @xmath27 , in the time it takes to replace it by accretion , giving @xmath28 .",
    "this exhibits the scaling that appears in the formal viewpoint , which is to consider the heat equation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the nuclear burning rate , @xmath31 is the entropy , and @xmath32 is the slow downward advection speed from accretion . in pressure units , and",
    "neglecting nuclear burning and the time - dependent piece , this becomes @xmath33 the entropy decreases inward ( i.e. the envelope and core are not convective ) , so this is an outward going @xmath34 .",
    "the entropy profile is fixed by the temperature gradient needed to carry the luminosity outward and thus we simultaneously solve equation ( 2 ) ( putting back in @xmath30 ) with the heat transport equation , using opacities and conductivities from iglesias & rogers ( 1996 ) and itoh et al . ( 1983 ) .",
    "for an analytic understanding , we integrate through the non - degenerate envelope , where @xmath35 . here",
    ", @xmath34 is nearly constant , giving @xmath36 . integrating down to the isothermal core yields @xmath13",
    ".    now , let s turn to the degenerate carbon / oxygen core . for the @xmath2 s and typical @xmath37 wd of interest here ,",
    "all of the entropy is in the liquid ions at @xmath38 .",
    "the time it takes to transport heat through the interior is @xmath39 , so the core is isothermal and any compression is far from adiabatic . considered for more massive type ia progenitors , where the interior undergoes nearly adiabatic compression ( see bravo et al .",
    "due to uncertainty from the classical novae cycle , we do nt know whether the c / o core is secularly increasing in mass , but if it were , almost all of the work of compression goes into increasing the electron fermi energy .",
    "the integrated heat release would only be @xmath40 ( nomoto 1982 ) for a @xmath41 c / o wd , where @xmath42 is the ion mean molecular weight .",
    "because of the mean molecular weight contrast , this is about a factor of five smaller than that released in the envelope .",
    "thus , the entropy drop through the accreted layer is larger than that across the core , making the accreted layer the main source of compressional heating .",
    "for our initial study , we dropped the time - dependent term in equation ( [ eq : heateq ] ) , and presumed that the c / o wd mass was constant throughout the classical nova cycle , thus only accounting for the compressional heating and @xmath30 in the h / he layer .",
    "this method improves on that of iben et al .",
    "( 1992 ) by allowing the accreted envelope mass to change through the @xmath43 year classical nova cycle .",
    "early in the cycle , the mass of the accreted layer is small , compressional heating is small , and the wd cools . later in the cycle ,",
    "the accreted layer becomes thick enough that compressional heating along with slow hydrogen burning releases a sufficient amount of energy to heat the core . as the wd has a large heat capacity , reaching the equilibrium @xmath17 where the heat exchanged between the envelope and core averages to zero over a single classical nova cycle takes @xmath44 years . since this time is usually shorter than the time over which @xmath2 changes , we construct such equilibrium accretors for a given @xmath10 and @xmath2 .    to do this ,",
    "we first fix @xmath17 at the outer edge of the c / o core at a pressure high enough so that the changing accumulated mass has little direct effect . with a radiative outer boundary condition",
    ", we then integrate our structure equations with equation ( [ eq : heateq ] ) to find the envelope state for an @xmath2 and accreted layer mass .",
    "see figure [ fig : t - p ] for examples of the resulting @xmath45-@xmath46 relations .",
    "we then evaluate the luminosity across the chosen location ( the right edge of the plot in figure [ fig : t - p ] ) for a number of different accreted layer masses up to the unstable ignition .",
    "the ignition mass is found by comparing the @xmath45 and @xmath47 at the base of the accreted ( hydrogen rich ) layer with the analytic ignition curves in fujimoto ( 1982 ) .",
    "we vary @xmath17 to find an equilibrium model , where the `` core luminosity '' ( @xmath48 ) averages to zero over the classical nova cycle as shown in figure [ fig : loop ] .",
    "the quiescent @xmath0 which is expected for the same cycle is shown in figure [ fig : teff ] . at the nova outburst",
    "we assume that the accreted shell is expelled , and that due to the rapidity of this event , it does not appreciably heat the wd .",
    "the resulting equilibrium core temperatures for @xmath49yr are @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 . the @xmath54 star is hotter than the @xmath55 star because it has a larger maximum accumulated mass that leads to a longer period of core heating . for a @xmath41 wd , the core temperatures are @xmath56 and 18.0 for @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "this also gives us the @xmath0 range during the classical nova cycle , which we now compare to observations .",
    "in contrast to sion s ( 1995 ) simulations which only directly addressed the immediate cooling after outburst , our work has focused on the release of heat from the deep interior .",
    "the long - timescale nature of heating in these deep layers allows a comparison between our results and the observed @xmath0 s . for cvs in the field , the large set of stis observations by szkody et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and previous observations ( urban et al . 2000 ) provide detailed spectra of quiescent wds in dn .",
    "figure [ fig : lars ] shows the current @xmath0 measurements and compares them to our results . the measurements are made during deep quiescence when the accretion luminosity is negligible and are intended to be long enough after the outbursts that other emission mechanisms ( e.g. pringle s ( 1988 ) suggestion of radiative illumination of the wd ) have faded . in that case , we are observing heat directly from the deep wd interior .",
    "the number of such systems will increase due to upcoming all - sky surveys ( such as sdss and 2df , see marsh et al .",
    "2001 ) , and will push to lower @xmath2 systems with long quiescent intervals .",
    "we can already give some general insight from the initial results shown .",
    "our work indicates that below the period gap , @xmath59 and the wd masses are in the range @xmath60-@xmath53 .",
    "this agrees with the expectation from kolb & baraffe ( 1999 ) , who find @xmath61 at an orbital period of 2 hours presuming angular momentum losses from gravitational waves alone . above the period gap ,",
    "the @xmath0 is higher , and we estimate @xmath62 .",
    "we predict that a @xmath41 wd above the gap has a core temperature of @xmath63 k and , if in equilibrium below the gap , @xmath64k .",
    "an interesting question is whether the wd will have time to cool this much as it traverses the gap . if not , then the wd s below the period gap will be hotter than our calculation implies .",
    "we estimate this cooling time from the current wd cooling law ( e.g. chabrier et al .",
    "2000 ) along with the heat capacity of the core , @xmath65,\\ ] ] which gives @xmath66 gyr . since this is comparable to the estimated time spent in the gap ( howell et al . 2001 ) , our equilibrium assumption below the gap is likely safe .",
    "however , note that about 0.2 gyrs after accretion halts , the wd will enter the zz - ceti instability strip !",
    "these results also have bearing on the search for faint cvs in globular clusters .",
    "the expected population might well contain many low @xmath2 systems that spend much of their time in quiescence .",
    "these cvs are commonly searched for via the presence of hydrogen emission lines or x - ray emission ( as recent chandra observations have found ; grindlay et al . 2001a ,",
    "grindlay et al .",
    "2001b ) , and this method is fruitful .",
    "however , for the very - low @xmath2 systems , the disks can be very dim and the quiescent x - ray emission too faint even for chandra .",
    "we now show that these systems ( as well as cvs crossing the period gap or those `` hibernating '' post - novae , shara et al .",
    "1986 ) can be identified by their position in a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) . by using our theory of the thermal state of the wd ,",
    "it is possible to predict the broadband colors of cv systems without dependence on the disk luminosity .",
    "an excellent example is ngc 6397 ( king et al .",
    "1998 ; taylor et al .",
    "figure [ fig : gc ] shows a cmd of ngc 6397 with our initial results that provide a relationship between @xmath0 and @xmath2 .",
    "the lines were produced by superposing a wd with the maximum @xmath0 for the indicated @xmath2 with a ms star .",
    "except for near the wd cooling line ( dashed curve ) , where the wd becomes completely dominant , the @xmath67 magnitude is set by the ms companion .",
    "the large dots along the @xmath68 and @xmath69 lines indicate where the ms companion is 0.3 , 0.2 , 0.15 and 0.1 @xmath70 , and two additional points at 0.09 and 0.085 @xmath70 are indicated on the @xmath71 line .",
    "this immediately provides a number of candidate systems ( namely , those data residing in this part of the cmd ) .",
    "the circled points are the `` non - flickerers '' ( cool et .",
    "al . 1998 ) recently reported by taylor et al .",
    "the three at @xmath72 are very strong h@xmath73 absorbers ( consistent with a da wd ) and were not detected by chandra ( grindlay et al .",
    "these authors had discussed these systems as possible helium wds with millisecond pulsar companions , though , given our work , we would claim that these are hot wds with @xmath74 ms companions .",
    "in addition , the population of data points in this diagram with respect to our theoretical curves will eventually constrain cv evolutionary scenarios .",
    "if we assume many of the data points are cvs , we already see that most systems with high @xmath2 have @xmath75 companions",
    ". the large number of data points below the @xmath76 line could well be the long - sought post - turnaround systems with @xmath77 and companion masses @xmath78 ( howell et al . 1997 ) .",
    "we have evaluated the action of compressional heating of accreting wd interiors . most of the compressional energy release takes place in the accreted envelope , and is thermally communicated to the core .",
    "the maximum envelope mass is set by the unstable nuclear burning that causes a classical nova runaway and most likely expels the accreted mass .",
    "we have constructed equilibrium accretors which have constant core temperatures such that the heat lost from the core when the envelope is thin ( i.e. right after the classical nova ) is balanced by that regained when the envelope is thick .",
    "this equilibrium determines the @xmath0 of the wd throughout the classical nova cycle .",
    "our models agree with the observations of dwarf novae in deep quiescence and imply @xmath79 yr@xmath80 just below the period gap and @xmath81 yr@xmath80 just above the period gap for wd masses in the range @xmath60@xmath53 .",
    "though our initial efforts have met with apparent success , there is still much to be done .",
    "first we need to investigate the relevant parameter ranges ( e.g. @xmath10 and @xmath2 ) within our initial scheme .",
    "the most critical parameter to vary is the metallicity of the accreted material , lowering to values relevant for globular cluster science .",
    "we must also survey our initial assumptions :    * wd excavation or accretion .",
    "the assumption that there was no net mass loss or gained by the wd through the classical nova cycle must be relaxed .",
    "this will allow for cooling of the wd due to adiabatic expansion after mass loss , or heating if it is increasing in mass .",
    "the large c / o fractions seen in some novae ejecta ( gehrz et al .",
    "1998 ) might indicate that the wd is decreasing in mass at @xmath2 . * a self consistent accounting for the ignition masses , including varying the metallicity .",
    "our initial work used fujimoto s ( 1982 ) results for simplicity , but these are limited at low @xmath2 s .",
    "a careful comparison to more modern nova calculations ( e.g. prialnik & kovetz 1995 ) must be carried out . *",
    "thermal evolution of the wd .",
    "we also need to concern ourselves with the secular change of @xmath2 due to the decreasing companion mass or changing angular momentum losses ( such as a drop in magnetic braking at the period gap ) .",
    "when this occurs on a timescale comparable to the wd thermal time , it is possible that the wd will not reach the steady - state solution we have assumed . this memory of previous higher @xmath2 epochs could well allow the wd to be hotter than the equilibrium accretor .    while these steps are unlikely to change our understanding of the compressional heating mechanism , each is essential for applying our work to the observations . as assumptions are relaxed and investigated , much more will be learned about both the state of cv systems and their evolution .",
