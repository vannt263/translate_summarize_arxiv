    "<S> a close up of an anchor area is shown in a. the isolating effect of the gap in the au layer is clearly visible in the simulated temperature field shown in b. by removing roughly 5% of the au layer , the illumination sensitivity @xmath37 of a 1  @xmath2 m and 3  @xmath2 m wide string could be improved by a factor of 2.6 and 2.8 , respectively , as can be seen from the measurements presented in c. the gained enhancement of @xmath37 translates directly to an enhancement of the absorption sensitivity . </S>",

    "<S> b shows the resonance frequency of the string when focusing the laser beam either directly on the au nanoslit or planar gold film . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency difference , as shown in c , is directly caused by the additional photothermal heating of the plasmonic nanoslit . from the slope at low laser powers , an illumination sensitivity of @xmath44  ppm / nw can be extracted . at higher powers , the frequency detuning becomes slightly nonlinear . </S>",
    "<S> considering the estimated absorption sensitivity of @xmath45  ppm / nw , this corresponds to a ratio of absorbed to illuminated laser light of @xmath46  % . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the 90  nm wide and 1  @xmath2 m long plasmonic nanoslit absorbs 16  % of the illuminated laser light with a beam diameter of 5.0@xmath430.8  @xmath2 m and a wavelength of @xmath47  nm . with a simulated temperature sensitivity of 19  mk / nw ( see b ) , this results in a nanoslit induced heating of 0.5  k and 14.6  k for the lowest ( 147  nw ) and highest ( 4.8  @xmath2w ) laser power , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest illuminance used in this experiment of 8  nw/@xmath2m@xmath3 is more than 6 orders of magnitude lower than the illuminance of 40  mw/@xmath2m@xmath3 typically used in state - of - the - art probing of plasmonic nanostructures . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite low illuminances are critical for studying thermal hot spots with ( bio)-molecules adsorbed on the metal surface to avoid photochemistry related effects or thermal decomposition of adsorbates .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the low - power photothermal probing and mapping of single plasmonic au nanoslits via the temperature - induced detuning of the resonance frequency of nanomechanical sin string resonators . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization dependent heating patterns are mainly observed in the vicinity of the nanoslits that can be attributed to excited lsps and the spps at the au / sin interface . </S>",

    "<S> the photothermal sensitivity of the string resonators was improved by a factor of @xmath48 by removing 5% of the thermally highly conductive au layer at the string ends . </S>",
    "<S> thereby , an absorption sensitivity for a nanomechanical silicon - rich sin string ( @xmath24  @xmath2 m , @xmath42  @xmath2 m , @xmath25  nm , covered with 50  nm au ) of @xmath49  </S>",
    "<S> ppm / nw was estimated based on an analytical model and confirmed using fem . </S>",
    "<S> the measured illumination sensitivity of @xmath50  ppm / nw of a single nanoslit ( 1  @xmath2 m long and 53  nm wide ) on such a string leads to an absorption ratio of @xmath51% of a laser beam with a diameter of 5.0@xmath430.8  @xmath2 m . </S>",
