    "one of the most puzzling features of the standard model ( sm ) is the lack of explanation of the gauge hierarchy problem . to solve this problem , apart from other popular ideas such as supersymmetry @xcite , and composite ( technicolor ) models @xcite",
    ", the brane world scenario has been invoked in various forms @xcite .",
    "the possibility of dynamical realization of the brane world idea via a domain wall was recognized quite early @xcite . a long - lasting obstacle for serious investigations of brane - world scenarios by domain walls , however , was the localization of gauge fields .",
    "naive attempts to localize gauge fields on the domain wall with the higgs phase in the bulk give no massless gauge fields in the effective theory @xcite ( see also @xcite for related studies ) .",
    "the so - called dvali - shifman ( ds ) mechanism @xcite is a popular way to get around the problem , inspired by a non - perturbative feature of the non - abelian gauge theories  the confinement .",
    "however , it has not been proven whether non - abelian gauge theories which exhibit the confinement in the bulk exist in @xmath3-dimensional spacetime with @xmath4 .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that one can implement the gauge field localization more easily in a semi - classical way . if the gauge coupling depends on the extra - dimensional coordinate in such a way that it rapidly diverges away from the brane ( semi - classical picture of confinement ) while remaining finite in the vicinity of the brane , it effectively provides a confining vacuum for zero modes of gauge fields with the four - dimensional gauge invariance intact .",
    "the mechanism is realized by a field - dependent gauge kinetic term @xcite .",
    "this arises naturally in @xmath5 supersymmetric gauge theories in five spacetime dimensions in the form of the so - called prepotential @xcite . in this framework",
    ", we have constructed models of non - abelian gauge fields localized around domain walls and worked out nonlinear interactions of moduli fields @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the higgs mechanism caused by the domain walls . in the previous works @xcite our studies were focused on how to localize the massless non - abelian gauge fields on the walls . in contrast , in the present paper , we aim at figuring out how the massless gauge fields get non - zero masses in the framework @xcite . either by ds or ohta - sakai ( os ) mechanism , the localization of non - abelian gauge fields occurs due to the confining phase in the bulk .",
    "this has many similarities with the localization of gauge fields on d - branes in superstring theories .",
    "indeed , we found in our previous works @xcite that @xmath0 coincident domain walls are needed to have massless @xmath1 gauge fields inside the domain walls .",
    "therefore , we naturally expect that the higgs mechanism also goes similarly to low energy effective theory on d - branes , and we will show it is indeed so .",
    "it is often the case that a non - abelian global symmetry is realized in the coincident wall configuration .",
    "it has been found previously , that splitting of domain walls can break the global symmetry and the moduli fields corresponding to the wall positions become massless nambu - goldstone ( ng ) bosons associated to the symmetry breaking @xcite . when non - abelian gauge fields couple to the global symmetry , one naively expects that they will absorb these moduli fields and become massive .",
    "if this is the case , a splitting of positions of domain walls in the five - dimensional theory can induce a spontaneous breakdown of non - abelian gauge symmetry in the effective theory on domain walls .",
    "in other words , the moduli fields corresponding to the wall positions play the role of the higgs field in the effective field theory . since the geometrical data such as wall positions provide scalar fields realizing higgs phenomenon , we call this mechanism as the _ geometric higgs mechanism_.    in our previous works , we have observed geometric higgs mechanism @xcite indirectly through effective lagrangian . the purpose of this paper is to give direct study of the geometric higgs mechanism from the 5-dimensional point of view in detail . since the would - be ngs are not homogeneously distributed as they are affected by the domain wall background , the geometric higgs mechanism is not as straightforward as the standard higgs mechanism in homogeneous higgs vacuum",
    ". we will study physical spectrum via mode equations for all fields in detail and show that the gauge fields associated with the broken gauge symmetry absorb the localized ngs and get non - zero masses .",
    "furthermore , we calculate the four - dimensional low - energy effective lagrangian in the arbitrary domain wall background in the so - called moduli approximation @xcite .",
    "this effective lagrangian captures full non - linear interactions between moduli fields up to two derivative terms , which we write down in a closed form . with the effective lagrangian",
    ", we give a proof of the geometric higgs mechanism from the perspective of low energy effective theory on the domain walls .",
    "lastly , many similarities between domain walls and d - branes have been shown in the literature .",
    "for example , d1-d3-like configuration was found in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the low - energy effective theory on domain walls was found to be similar to that on d - branes @xcite . in our work",
    ", we find new evidence for the correspondence between domain walls and d - branes . like in d - branes",
    ", the number of coincident domain walls determines the rank of the gauge group .",
    "in addition , the masses of gauge bosons are proportional to the distance between walls , at least when they are close . as a result ,",
    "our model further strengthens the notion of domain - wall - d - brane correspondence .",

    "although we have not dealt with grand unification theories ( gut ) at all in this paper , natural and important application of the geometric higgs mechanism is , doubtless , to realize gut dynamically on the domain walls .",
    "we will investigate it separately in the subsequent work @xcite .    as to the other side of our result , we pointed out deep similarity between our domain walls and d - branes in superstring theories .",

    "the main reason behind these similarities is the localization of non - abelian gauge fields which is caused by the confinement in the bulk realized semi - classically via the field - dependent gauge kinetic term @xcite .    in this paper , we have not taken susy as our guiding principle .",
    "however , it may be advantageous to consider five - dimensional susy with eight supercharges as a master theory .",
    "the immediate benefit of implementing susy is that a gauge kinetic term as a function of scalar field occurs naturally via the prepotential @xcite .",
    "further , domain walls are often realized as 1/2 bps objects , which spontaneously break half of the supercharges .",
    "a combination of wall and anti - wall in the background then breaks susy entirely @xcite .",
    "another feature common to most non - abelian gauge theories is magnetic monopoles , which originate from the breaking of the semi - simple gauge group to a subgroup with a @xmath350 factor . from a phenomenological point of view , monopoles are important in cosmology . in standard yang - mills theory in 3 + 1 dimensions , the magnetic monopoles are t hooft - polyakov type point - like solitons @xcite .",
    "however , in our model monopoles arise as string - like objects , stretched between separated domain walls , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : monopole ] .",
    "the reason is that the asymptotic vacua outside domain walls are @xmath1 preserving , while only between the walls the symmetry is broken down to some subgroup , allowing for a non - trivial topology .",
    "let us also remark , that this type of configuration has a direct analog in d - strings @xcite .",
    "detailed study of these observations is a subject of a forthcoming work .",
    "lastly , in this work we have not discussed gravity for simplicity . however , an interesting direction for future study may be to consider randall - sundrum - like theory @xcite with multiple branes and investigate the issues of cosmological constant and the hierarchy problem there . another and a perhaps more natural option is to employ position - dependent gravitational constant as a means to localize massless gravitons on multiple domain walls , thus creating the background dynamically . in this",
