    "in recent years investigations of the spin phenomena in hopping transport have gone through a vigorous revival . in particular , the increasing interest to this problem is related to the discovery of a strong spin - valve effect in organic semiconductor devices@xcite .",
    "there is a consensus that the conductivity in these devices is determined by hopping polarons@xcite .",
    "such devices show a number of spin - related phenomena , including the spin - valve effect itself that are not understood .",
    "these experimental results were followed by a number of theoretical investigations of the hopping conduction @xcite including fluctuations of conductivity @xcite and most important the spin phenomena like magnetoresistance @xcite and the relaxation of magnetic moment@xcite .",
    "most of these theoretical studies are based on semi - qualitative concepts with the lack of solid theoretical proof .",
    "although in some cases ( for example in the case of strong coulomb interaction ) the self consistent theory of hopping transport does not exist , there is a way to make theory of hopping transport self consistent .",
    "this theory is described in ref.@xcite . up to now",
    "the theory includes the electron spin only in the limit of the small electron density@xcite .    here",
    "we develop the generalization of this theory to include spin and arbitrary probability of the site occupation ( with possible double occupation ) .",
    "we argue that the self consistent theory of hopping transport is necessary in order to test the semi - qualitative concepts @xcite and to understand the electron and the spin transport in organic semiconductors .",
    "our starting point is the general hamiltonian that describe a system of localized sites with the possibility of hopping due to electron - phonon interaction .",
    "then we derive general kinetic equations that describe both the charge and the spin transport in hopping media .",
    "we argue that these equations are a useful tool to study hopping transport phenomena .    in the present paper",
    "we apply these kinetic equations to the problem of the spin relaxation due to random on - site magnetic fields in a system with the positional disorder .",
    "the understanding of the spin relaxation is clearly important for the theory of the spin - related transport phenomena like spin - valve magnetoresistance . up to now the most studied mechanism of the spin relaxation in hopping transport",
    "is the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the theory of this relaxation mechanism is discussed in refs.@xcite . in ref.@xcite the basic understanding of spin relaxation for the hopping transport due to",
    "spin - orbit interaction was formulated . in ref.@xcite the results of @xcite were significantly expanded .",
    "it was pointed out @xcite that exponentially broad distribution of hopping rates plays determinant role in the relaxation .",
    "however this distribution was considered semi - quantitatively .",
    "in ref.@xcite it was proposed that in the case of hopping conduction the spin relaxation due to the spin - orbit interaction may be significantly enhanced by the exchange interaction .",
    "while the spin - orbit interaction is supposed to dominate the spin relaxation in non - organic semiconductors with hopping conductivity the situation in the organic materials may be different .",
    "in organic semiconductors the spin - orbit interaction is substantially suppressed @xcite and another mechanisms like hyperfine interaction can govern the spin relaxation .",
    "the theoretical description of this mechanisms is different because the spin - orbit interaction does not affect the spin of a localized electron and manifest itself only in the spin rotation during the hop . on the other hand the hyperfine interaction leads to the appearance of random effective on - site magnetic fields that rotate electron spins even without hops .",
    "note that in the organic spin - valve devices there is the another source of random fields unique to these case .",
    "the finite roughness of the contacts leads to a leakage of the magnetic field from the ferromagnetic contacts to the organic layer @xcite .",
    "this fringe magnetic field can be a source of additional mechanism of the spin relaxation . in terms of theoretical description",
    "it is added to the hyperfine field and also rotate spins on the localized sites .    recently",
    "harmon and flatte @xcite proposed an interesting approach to the spin relaxation based on the waiting time distribution .",
    "they considered both the spin - orbit and the hyperfine relaxation mechanisms .",
    "however their approach does not take into account the pauli principe and is applicable only to the limit of the small electron concentrations .",
    "also refs.@xcite consider only the energy disorder and the positional disorder was neglected .",
    "the derived kinetic equations allow us to describe spin relaxation with any site occupation probability . in the present work we apply them to the problem with the positional disorder and",
    "neglect the energy disorder .",
    "we show that even in this case there are several phenomena in the spin relaxation that were not discussed previously .",
    "most important of them is perhaps the non - homogeneous character of the spin relaxation . in some cases the relaxation of spin of the electrons important for conduction is substantially different from the relaxation of the average spin of the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sect_kin1 ]",
    "we discuss the usual way of describing hopping conduction and its justification in terms of kinetic equations . in section [ sect_kin2 ]",
    "we generalize approach @xcite to include electron spin and derive general form of kinetic equation . in section [ sect_kinlin ]",
    "we linearize the kinetic equations and derive generalized version of miller - abrahams resistor network .",
    "finally in section [ sect_relax ] we use the kinetic equations to describe the spin relaxation in the hopping conduction regime .",
    "the usual approach to the theoretical description of the hopping transport starts with the introduction of the hopping rates between pairs of sites @xcite .",
    "the hopping rate from site @xmath0 to site @xmath1 is defined as @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the overlap integral between sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath4 is the distance between these sites , @xmath5 is the localization radius . @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the occupation probabilities of sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath8 is the difference of energies of states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath9 is the part of hopping rate related to the number of phonons , involved in the hopping .",
    "it is equal to @xmath10 when @xmath11 , i.e. , when the hopping occurs with the phonon emission and to @xmath12 otherwise . here",
    "@xmath12 is the number of phonons with energy @xmath13 .",
    "then the current between sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 is introduced as @xmath14 @xmath15 when the external electric field is absent . in a weak electric field the current follows the ohm law @xmath16 with effective resistor voltage @xmath17 corresponding to the shift of electrochemical potential between sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the resistance @xmath18 is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the hopping rate between sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 without the external field , @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant .    as a result",
    "the real system with the hopping conductivity is replaced by a network of classical resistors .",
    "this network can be treated with percolative methods . in this case one",
    "finds the threshold resistance that allows the percolation to the macroscopic distances . in the case",
    "when the distribution of resistances @xmath18 is exponentially broad , this threshold resistance governs the conductivity of the whole system .    without coulomb interaction",
    "this approach can be consistently derived in terms of kinetic equations @xcite .",
    "it is the starting point of many theoretical studies and works quite well in many cases .",
    "however it has some problem when the hopping conductance becomes dependent on the electron spin because spin is not included in the equations ( [ gamma ] - [ resist ] ) .",
    "let us discuss how this scheme can be modified in order to include electron spin and how it was altered in previous studies .",
    "the essential part of the discussed treatment is the percolation theory that is a conventional way to study analytically dc current in a hopping system with a broad distribution of hopping rates .",
    "as long as the hopping rates depend on spin and electron spins are not totally polarized the theory should also contain some sort of averaging over possible spin direction .",
    "there are at least two possible orders of this procedures : one can first do the spin averaging and then calculate the percolation parameters or calculate the percolation threshold first and then average over spin ( or make some more sophisticated approach to relating these two procedures ) .",
    "different existing studies apply different order of percolation and spin averaging .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the percolation was calculated over resistors network that considered both probabilities of having spin up and spin down electron on each site .",
    "these probabilities depend on the magnetic field when zeeman energy is of the order of @xmath22 leading to the magnetoresistance .",
    "the percolation with rates averaged over spin directions was also implicitly considered in @xcite and @xcite where it was noted that electron spins should be freezed in order to have negative interference magnetoresistance ( otherwise the averaging over spin directions kills the effect ) .",
    "the another relation between percolation and spin averaging was considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these articles",
    "it was allowed double - occupation of the sites but only for electrons with antiparallel spins ( more exactly : in singlet spin state ) .",
    "this assumption agrees with @xcite but the following approach is different .",
    "the approach in @xcite starts with momentary site occupations and momentary spin projections .",
    "then the percolation is considered in terms of effective concentration of sites allowed for the hop of a given electron .",
    "double occupied sites are always excluded from the percolation ( disregarding the fact that they may be empty in following moments of time ) .",
    "single occupied sites are included in the percolation when the spin on the site is antiparallel to the spin of the hopping electron .",
    "if electron spins are parallel the site is included in percolation with some probability @xmath23 reflecting that the spin flip can occur faster than the hopping of an electron to a distant site .",
    "with @xmath24 the percolation is calculated before spin averaging .",
    "finite @xmath23 leads to a more sophisticated relation between percolation and spin averaging .",
    "the dependence of @xmath25 on magnetic fields leads to the magnetoresistance .",
    "the approach different from previous two was proposed by osaka @xcite .",
    "the percolation in the model of the resistor network was considered .",
    "the spin - flip process was considered as an additional resistor connected in parallel to a normal one .",
    "we want to underline that the discussed approaches are not equivalent and lead to different physical results .",
    "for example in the approach of @xcite the concentration of sites that participate in percolation is the full concentration of sites as long as there is some probability for any site to be allowed for the hop . in @xcite",
    "at least double occupied sites are always excluded from the percolation .    to understand what is the correct procedure of spin introduction into the percolation theory",
    "let us consider the procedure of the consistent derivation of the approach ( [ gamma ] ) .",
    "this procedure is described by bottger and bryksin @xcite , however we remake it here in a slightly different way to make its generalization easier .",
    "note that the discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite is focused on the case of low occupation numbers and it is stated that that the result for any occupation number is similar if the hartree decoupling is used .",
    "we make our theory with hartree expansion from the beginning ..    we start with the hopping hamiltonian after polaron transformation , which is well known in the polaron transport theory@xcite .",

    "@xmath36 is the electron - phonon interaction matrix element @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is the position of the site @xmath0 , @xmath39 is the polaron binding energy .",
    "the conventional derivation of the kinetic equation @xcite starts with the full description of the system ( with liouville equations if the system is classical or with hamiltonian if the system is quantum ) .",
    "then the system is divided into the parts that interact weakly or rarely .",
    "we divide the system into the set of noninteracting sites , described by the hamiltonian @xmath40 , and weak interaction of different sites , described by the hamiltonian @xmath41 . in order to describe the system with the set of kinetic equation we have to assume that the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath40 are well defined and therefore @xmath41 is much smaller than @xmath40 .    in zero order over @xmath41",
    "the full density matrix of the system is diagonal in terms of electron filling numbers @xmath42 .",
    "the theory of hopping conduction near fermi level ( that we are interested in ) is based on the hartree - fock decoupling for the density matrix @xcite . with this decoupling",
    "the full density matrix can be expanded as a product of the single site density matrices .",
    "@xmath43 here we used the basis of the filling numbers .",
    "the set of the system states that has definite filling numbers @xmath44 is the complete set of states of the system . as usual the density matrix has two indexes each of them corresponding to one of the states of the complete set .",

    "we will use the interaction representation , therefore @xmath45 does not depend on time without perturbation . in the first perturbation order we obtain @xmath48 , \\quad \\rho^{(ij ) }",

    "the contribution of the product @xmath52 corresponds to the mean - field correction to the energy @xmath33 and is usually neglected .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath53 is governed by the off - diagonal part @xmath54 .    to obtain the equation for @xmath54 one should write the equation for the two site density matrix @xmath55 + \\frac{1}{i\\hbar}\\sum_k { \\rm tr_k } \\left[(\\widetilde{h}_{hop})_{ik } + ( \\widetilde{h}_{hop})_{kj } , \\rho^{(ijk ) } \\right].\\ ] ] note that @xmath54 enters equation ( [ rho1 ] ) with the coefficient @xmath56 .",
    "the right hand side of eq.([rho2 ] ) also contains @xmath41 .",
    "here we neglect all powers of @xmath41 higher than 2 .",
    "therefore we replace all many - site density matrices by the products of the one - site density matrices in the right hand side of eq.([rho2 ] ) . as a result",
    "we obtain the expression for @xmath57 : @xmath58 dt'.\\ ] ] to get the kinetic equation we assume that the correlated part @xmath57 decays much faster in comparison with the time scale on which the one - particle density matrix changes . therefore the one - site density matrices are out of the integral in eq.([d2 ] ) .",

    "therefore we should average the right - hand side of this equation over phonons . substituting eqs.([h_pol ] ) and ( [ matr1 ] ) into ( [ rho - gen ] ) we obtain the following result : @xmath60 where the hopping rate in the limit @xmath61 has the form : @xmath62.\\ ] ] the hoping rates in the limit of @xmath63 are derived in@xcite    it is the kinetic equation for the spinless electrons . in order to derive the dc current",
    "one should consider the steady state solutions of these equations @xmath64 and then introduce a small electric field . as a result the equation yields the standard formula for the current ( [ current ] ) where @xmath65 .",
    "let us discuss the applicability conditions of the kinetic equation .",
    "first of all it relies on the smallness of the intersite correlations @xmath54 . in the discussed problem",
    "it is closely related to the hartree decoupling .",
    "it is valid when the system is close to equilibrium @xcite . however far from equilibrium",
    "the site occupation may be correlated , therefore @xmath66 . in this case",
    "the system can not be described with a closed equation for @xmath67 .",
    "real systems , however can have other sources of these correlations ( even in the equilibrium ) .",
    "the most known of them is the coulomb interaction .",
    "the problem of the coulomb interaction in hopping conductivity is rather long - standing .",
    "if the coulomb interaction between neighboring sites is comparable with the random energies , the correlations can appear even without @xmath41 .",
    "in that case the applicability of the kinetic equation becomes questionable even in the spinless case .",
    "the standard answer for this problem is that the kinetic equation is still applicable but the density of single electron states should be considered taking into account the coulomb interaction .",
    "it leads to the formation of the coulomb gap near fermi level .",
    "equation ( [ df / dt ] ) with the coulomb gap was successfully used to obtain the well - known efros - shklovskii temperature dependance of conductivity @xcite , however the other consequences of coulomb interaction are still under discussion",
    ".    another important simplification is neglecting of all the high - order terms of @xmath68 .",
    "it is known that these higher order terms may lead to the phenomena that are important for the hopping conductivity . recently in refs . @xcite it was argued that intersite exchange effects may be important for the spin relaxation and the spin transport .",
    "another example is the sub - barrier scattering that is responsible for the linear negative magnetoresistance in semiconductors with the variable - range hopping conductivity @xcite .",
    "although these phenomena are important , we believe that it is more important to understand low - order physics before consider these high - order phenomena .",
    "up to this moment our results repeat the traditional scheme @xcite , at least when dc current is under consideration .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that it may be easily generalized for the case when electrons have spins and can double occupy a site",
    ".    equation ( [ rho - gen ] ) does not depend on the exact structure of the one site density matrix corresponding to spinless electrons .",
    "it relies only on the kinetic equation assumptions that are valid in general case . therefore in order to generalize our theory we have to include spin into the hamiltonian , define the structure of one - site density matrix in general case , and perform the calculations that are analogous to the derivation of eq.([df / dt ] ) .",
    "here we consider the case when the electron spin conserves during the hopping ( the under - barrier spin rotation is discussed in section [ sect_so ] ) .",
    "however we include small on - site spin hamiltonian @xmath69 that describes rotation of the spin over the effective local magnetic field @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the local effective magnetic field and @xmath72 is the operator of spin on site @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath73 @xmath74 here @xmath75 is the spin index that can have two values  @xmath76 \" and  @xmath77 \" .",
    "@xmath78 is the hubbard energy .",
    "the introduction of the term @xmath79 corresponds to the following model .",
    "we allow double occupation of the site but consider that other excited orbital states at the same site have very large energies .",
    "so far both electrons on a double - occupied site have the same coordinate wave - function and their spins should form a singlet state .",
    "double occupation of a site with two electrons in the triplet spin state is not allowed .",
    "@xmath80 acts only on electrons on site @xmath0 and conserve the filling number of this site , i.e. , it can only rotate the spin on a single - occupied site .",
    "@xmath81 where @xmath82 is defined after eq.([h_pol ] ) .",
    "the hopping part of the hamiltonian ( [ h_hop_sp ] ) conserves the spin .",
    "the one - site density matrix in the representation of filling numbers @xmath83 now contains four indexes and have 16 matrix elements .",
    "we however will use another representation in this section .",
    "the complete set of states for one site with possibility of double occupation has four states that can be selected as @xmath84 here @xmath85 is the empty site , @xmath86 is the double occupied site , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the states of the site when it has one electron with spin up and down respectively .",
    "so one can write one - site density matrix with only two indexes , each of them can have any of four values described in ( [ 4states ] ) .    in zeroth order over @xmath41 we have only matrix elements of the one - site density matrix that conserve the filling number .",
    "for the spinless electrons there were only two such elements .",
    "now we have six of them .",
    "@xmath89 only these 6 matrix elements appear in the kinetic equation .    along with the density matrix elements ( [ 5el ] )",
    "it is sometimes useful to consider another set of 6 numbers , that are linear combinations of the matrix elements ( [ 5el ] ) , in order to describe the state of the site .",
    "these numbers allow us to track directly the occupation number and the mean value of the magnetic moment of the site .",
    "the transition to these numbers was proposed by bryksin ( without double occupation probability)@xcite .",

    "it is valid when @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the characteristic decay time of the correlation @xmath111 .",
    "( in the opposite limit the kinetic equation becomes non - markovian ) .",
    "we also did not include the zeeman energy when the averaging over phonon states eq .",
    "( [ rho - gen ] ) is discussed .",
    "this assumptions are justified when @xmath102 is small compared to @xmath35 and @xmath22    for larger magnetic fields especially when zeeman energy becomes larger than temperature the kinetic equations in the present form are valid only when the site magnetization and the magnetic field are oriented along one axis ( in that case @xmath102 does not lead to the magnetization precession ) . in that case",
    "the site energies in the equation should include the zeeman energy .",
    "if the on - site magnetic field is large and is oriented along different axes the phonon averaging can lead to more complex equations .",

    "the kinetic equations eqs.([kin_f0]-[kin_f2 ] ) were derived with the approximation that the electron spin is conserved during the hop .",
    "this approximation is not sufficient when the spin - orbit interaction is essential for the kinetics .",

    "the possibility of inclusion of the spin - orbit interaction into kinetic equation for hopping conductivity was discussed in @xcite , where corresponding kinetic equations were derived in the limit of low occupation numbers .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction leads to a precession of the electron spin during the under - barrier motion .",
    "it is important that for a given pair of sites @xmath0 and @xmath1 the angle of precision is not random ( it is the same for all hops between these two sites ) .",

    "we compare the results with the average magnetic moment on the cluster when all the sites in the system are present in fig .",
    "[ fig : clu ] ( b ) . for times",
    "@xmath320 the curves are the same except for the small difference in relaxation time .",
    "however for @xmath319 the relaxation of cluster slows down when all sites are included into the computation and remains exponential when we exclude all sites outside of the cluster .",
    "therefore we conclude that @xmath321 sites that are not included in the infinite cluster govern the magnetization dynamics of the infinite cluster at sufficiently large times .    in the discussed situation",
    "the difference between relaxation of the average moment and of the moment of the infinite cluster become important only when the magnetic moment of the system becomes small ( @xmath322 from the initial magnetization ) .",
    "we believe that it is due to the fact that in our situation most sites are included into the percolation cluster .",
    "however the density of the cluster tends to zero for @xmath258 .",
    "also it is known that the density of the infinite cluster is considered to be small in the theory of variable - range hopping @xcite .",
    "we believe that when the density of the percolative cluster is small the difference between the mean magnetization and the magnetization of the infinite cluster should be more pronounced .",
    "we have demonstrated that even at the small magnetic fields the relaxation of the magnetic moment have slow non - exponential tails . at large values of the random magnetic fields",
    "these non - exponential regime covers most part of the relaxation .",
    "we have argued that at least for large times this non - exponential relaxation can be described in term of traps , the sites that are rather far from their neighbors .",
    "let us discuss the physics of this non - exponential relaxation .",
    "let us consider the spin on some trap .",
    "when the magnetic moment is transferred from the trap to its neighbors it quickly relaxes due to fast hops outside of the trap .",
    "therefore each trap @xmath0 has the relaxation rate @xmath323 that is the rate of electron hopping from this trap .",
    "naturally @xmath324 is proportional to the @xmath325 , where @xmath326 is the distance between the trap and the nearest site .",

    "the characteristic number of sites that are effective neighbors of the trap is @xmath328 . for large @xmath326",
    "it becomes larger than unity . in this case",
    "@xmath323 can be expressed as @xmath329    , @xmath330 compared with analytical approximation ( [ mpores ] ) and ( [ nei_rate ] ) , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    to estimate the relaxation one should integrate the exponent @xmath331 with the distribution function of distances to the nearest neighbor . @xmath332",
    "the integral ( [ mpores ] ) can be approximated in the limit @xmath327 , @xmath333    fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] shows the comparison of the numerical simulations of the relaxation of the magnetic moment for @xmath280 , @xmath334 with the approximate formulae ( [ mpores ] ) and ( [ nei_rate ] ) . the comparison with eq.([mpores ] ) contain no free parameters , comparison with eq.([nei_rate ] ) contain one free parameter @xmath335 .",
    "we conclude that there is at least semi - quantitative agreement between the simulation in the non - exponential phase of relaxation and approximate formulae .",
    "eq.([nei_rate ] ) is in agreement with the expression proposed in ref.@xcite for the case of the spin - orbit mechanism of relaxation in the limit of strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "note that the similar expression in @xcite has more free parameters .",
    "although our theory and the theory presented in ref.@xcite deal with different relaxation mechanisms , in the limit of strong magnetic field or the limit of strong spin orbit interaction the relaxation in both cases is governed by the distribution of hopping rates . as a result",
    "different spin relaxation mechanisms lead to the similar non - exponential regimes of the spin relaxation .",
    "we derived the kinetic equations for the hopping transport that take into account the electron spin and the possibility of double occupation . in the limit of low voltage",
    "they are reduced to the generalized miller - abrahams resistor network .",
    "we have applied the kinetic equations to the problem of spin relaxation in the positionaly disordered system with neighbor hopping due to interaction with the random on - site hyperfine ( or fringe ) magnetic field .",
    "we show that the initial relaxation rate is governed by the critical hops with the rates comparable with the rate of the spin precession in a random fields . at large times as well as in the case of the large random fields",
    "the relaxation becomes non - exponential and is related to the relaxation of the spin in the traps .",
    "the relaxation is strongly inhomogeneous : the relaxation of sites in the conduction cluster differs substantially from the relaxation of the sites outside of this cluster .",
    "however in some cases the traps can drastically affect the relaxation of the magnetic moment of the infinite cluster .",
