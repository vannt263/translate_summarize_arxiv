    "recently , lasing modes from dielectric microcavities have attracted much attention due to its potential application to optoelectric circuits and optical communications @xcite . in particular",
    ", there was a lot of theoretical and experimental effort to excite directional lasing modes in deformed microcavities @xcite .",
    "it is now well known that the lasing pattern has a very close relationship with the internal ray dynamics given by the boundary geometry of cavity .",
    "it is also reported that the property of the openness of the dielectric cavity plays an important role in the resonance pattern analysis @xcite .    for a general open system ,",
    "the survival probability time distribution ( sptd ) or its time derivative , the escape time distribution , is a basic physical quantity .",
    "many studies are focused on the relation between the long time behavior of the sptd and the internal dynamics , and it is known that the sptd has algebraic and exponential decays in integrable and chaotic systems , respectively @xcite . in mixed systems , having both integrable islands and chaotic sea in phase space , the sptd has algebraic long time behavior which originates from the slow escape mechanism due to the stickiness of kam tori @xcite .",
    "the property of openness of the dielectric cavity is different from the open systems previously studied @xcite .",
    "rays can escape through any boundary point , and partial escapes , depending on the incident angle , are possible .",
    "this unique property can be reflected on the long time behavior of the sptd .    in this paper",
    ", we study the sptd in dielectric cavities of various boundary geometries such as circle , stadium , and quadrupole , which are typical examples of integrable , chaotic , and mixed systems , respectively .",
    "the sptds in these dielectric cavities show basically similar behavior to the open cavity with a small hole on the cavity boundary , but the exponents are different . in particular , we show that the ergodic property can not be applied for the stadium - shaped dielectric cavity even in the small opening limit , @xmath3 , @xmath2 is the refractive index .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the algebraic long time behavior of the sptd in the circular dielectric cavity is derived analytically and confirmed numerically for both tm and te waves .",
    "it is shown in sec .",
    "iii that the sptd for a stadium - shaped cavity decays exponentially , and the exponent @xmath4 has @xmath5 dependence and the proportional coefficient can be understood from a simple model of the steady probability distribution ( spd ) .",
    "the sptd in the quadrupole - deformed dielectric cavity is discussed in sec .",
    "iv and we finally summarize the results in sec . v.",
    "many authors have studied the sptd for the open billiard with a small hole on boundary @xcite .",
    "it is known that the sptd in a circular billiard decays algebraically , @xmath6 . in this section",
    "we study the sptd for the circular dielectric cavity , and it will be shown that the sptd shows still an algebraic decay but the exponent is different .    for simplicity , we focus on tm wave first and for te wave we will mention only difference later . in the circular geometry ,",
    "ray dynamics is integrable and rays in the open area of the phase space , i.e. , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the incident angle , can partially escape from the cavity .",
    "the formal expression of the sptd in the circular dielectric cavity is given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the boundary length , and @xmath12 is the critical line for total internal reflection , i.e. , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the reflection coefficient for tm wave @xcite ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the number of bounce on the boundary . since @xmath18 in the circular geometry , when considering a unit circle and a time scale as the length of ray trajectory , eq.([psv ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath19 , \\label{pg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20    note that the rays near the critical line @xmath12 can survive longer time and dominate long time tail behavior .",
    "therefore , we can expand @xmath21 from @xmath22 by changing variable , @xmath23 , as @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 substituting the lowest term in eq.([g ] ) into eq.([pg ] ) , we can obtain the long time behavior of the sptd as @xmath27 \\nonumber \\\\   & \\simeq & \\frac{2\\sqrt{n^2 - 1}}{\\alpha^2 } \\ , t^{-2}. \\label{t2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we emphasize that the sptd for the circular dielectric cavity decays as @xmath28 as shown in eq.([t2 ] ) , different from the open billiard with a small hole where decays as @xmath29 .",
    "this means that the property of openness can change the exponent of the algebraic decaying sptd .    for te wave case",
    "the reflection coefficient is given by @xmath30 and the expansion of @xmath21 and the sptd at a long time are the same as eq.([g ] ) and eq.([t2 ] ) with different expansion coefficients , i.e. , @xmath31 and @xmath32 we note that the dependence of the sptd on the refractive index @xmath2 in tm and te waves is quite different , i.e. , @xmath33 for tm case , but @xmath34 for te case .",
    "the proportionality of @xmath35 of the te case does not mean that the circular cavity with a higher @xmath2 is more leaky , since we take into account of only the open region in the phase space,@xmath36 ( see eq.([psv ] ) ) .",
    "long time behavior and a very good agreement with the solid lines which represent the @xmath37 case in eq.([t2 ] ) .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in order to perform numerical calculation for the sptd in the circular cavity , we take @xmath38 random initial points in the open region of the phase space .",
    "we then trace each point with a weight determined by @xmath14 when bouncing from the boundary , and sum the weights between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , we take @xmath41 in the calculations , for all points in the ensemble , and finally normalize to be unit when @xmath42 .",
    "figure 1 shows the numerical results of the sptd in the circular cavity for tm and te cases .",
    "it is clear that the sptd for both cases shows an algebraic long time behavior , @xmath0 , and the dependence on @xmath2 is correctly described by eq.([t2 ] ) which is indicated by the solid lines for @xmath37 in fig.1 .",
    "is the same as in fig .",
    "1 . these can be fitted as @xmath43 in a short time range .",
    "( b ) the exponents @xmath44 .",
    "the solid line represents the result of a simple approximation of eq.([gamma ] ) .,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a substantial difference between the tm and te cases appears in the short time behavior . as shown in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) the short time behavior of the tm sptd is smoothly connected to the @xmath45 long time tail , on the other hand that of the te sptd shows rather an abrupt transition to the algebraic long time tail and the detail of the short time behavior seems to be characterized by an exponential decay .",
    "this exponential short time decay is clear in fig . 2 ( a ) and the exponent @xmath44 , when fitted as @xmath43 , appears as the solid dots in fig . 2 ( b ) .",
    "these exponents are well described by a simple approximation for the reflection coefficient @xmath46 .",
    "if we expand @xmath46 at @xmath47 and take only the lowest term , then @xmath48 the solid line in fig .",
    "2 ( b ) represents the relation @xmath49 here we emphasize that although the lowest term of the expansion of eq.([expand0 ] ) is the same for both tm and te cases , only te case allows the exponential short time decay .",
    "the reason for this is the existence of the brewster angle in the te case , @xmath50 where rays can escape without reflection , i.e. , @xmath51 . the rays with the incident angle in the range of @xmath52 dominate the short time behavior , while the other parts , @xmath53 , mainly contribute to the long time algebraic tail .",
    "it is important to know when the algebraic decay starts to appear in both tm and te cases . in tm case ,",
    "the main factor for the deviation from the @xmath28 decay comes from the finite integral bound , and it corresponds to the terms containing the upper bound @xmath22 in eq.([t2 ] ) .",
    "we then estimate the transition time when the deviation from the @xmath28 decay is about 10 % , and the result is @xmath54 in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) the corresponding transition times are indicated by arrows and show a good agreement with the numerical calculations for various @xmath2",
    ".    due to the existence of the brewster angle , the transition time for te sptd can be determined by a different way . as mentioned above ,",
    "the te sptd shows a short time exponential behavior and a long time algebraic behavior . therefore we can estimate the transition time by finding the intersection time for both different behaviors . from eq.([t2 ] ) with @xmath55 and eq.([expand0 ] ) , for a large @xmath2 we can get an implicit equation for the transition time as @xmath56 the transition times for various refractive indices are indicated by arrows in fig . 1 ( b ) and",
    "well represent the transition times of the numerical results .",
    "the solution @xmath57 of the above equation can not be described by a simple power of @xmath2 , but we can show @xmath58 if we take a logarithm of eq.([tcte ] ) , then we get @xmath59 which generally has two solutions and the larger solution is relevant .",
    "the point @xmath60 , at which the slopes of the two functions in the left hand side of the above equation are identical , should locate between the two solutions . by differentiating the above equation",
    ", we get @xmath61 . therefore , @xmath62    even though both tm and te cases show the same @xmath28 long time decay in the circular cavity , the short time behavior and the @xmath2 dependence of the transition time are quite different .",
    "we emphasize that these differences originate from the existence of the brewster angle in the te case .",
    "as an example of chaotic dielectric cavities , we take a stadium - shaped one with parallel linear segments of a length @xmath63 and two semicircles of a radius @xmath64 .",
    "the stadium - shaped billiard has been a typical chaotic system in the research of classical and quantum chaos .",
    "the escape property through a small hole on the boundary of the stadium - shaped billiard has been investigated by many authors @xcite .",
    "they have shown that the escape time distribution exponentially decays first and later becomes algebraic , and the transition time @xmath57 increases as the hole size decreases .",
    "the algebraic decay at long times comes from the stickiness near the marginally stable line in phase space corresponding to the bouncing ball trajectories . on the other hand , in the stadium - shaped dielectric cavity the ray trajectories of the bouncing ball type",
    "can not contribute to the long time behavior due to the property of openness , i.e. , rays with almost vertical incidence escape easily and contribute to the short time behavior . as a result",
    "the sptd shows only exponential decay ( see fig . 4 , 5 ) .",
    "the exponential decay in the dielectric chaotic cavity implies the existence of the _ steady probability distribution _ ( spd ) , @xmath65 which is defined as the spatial part of the survival probability distribution @xmath66 @xcite . with this spd",

    "figure 3 ( a ) shows the approximate of the spd when @xmath37 which is a snap shot of the @xmath66 captured at about @xmath74 .",

    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    even though it is difficult to estimate the spd in usual cases , for the large @xmath2 case , the small opening case , we can simplify the spd by assuming a uniform distribution over the whole phase space except the open regions related to the linear segments of the stadium boundary .",
    "the approximate of the spd for @xmath73 shown in fig .",
    "3 ( b ) supports this assumption . we note that this is a substantial difference from the escape through a small hole on boundary where entirely uniform distribution is assumed due to the ergodic property @xcite . based on the assumption of the partial ergodicity , we can rewritten the decay rate as @xmath81 where we insert the factor @xmath82 , @xmath83 being the area of the stadium , from the consideration of time scale .",
    "the integral of the above equation means the degree of openness and in the large @xmath2 limit decreases as @xmath84 for both tm ( @xmath85 ) and te ( @xmath86 ) cases ( see appendix ) .",

    "the exponential behavior of the sptd is clear even at long time limit in both tm and te cases .",
    "this means that the sticky region locating on the center of the open region in phase space dose not contribute long time decay due to its easy escape .",
