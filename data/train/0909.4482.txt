    "ly@xmath0 blobs ( labs ) are large ly@xmath0 nebulae in the high redshift universe . since the 1980 s , labs have been discovered around high - redshift radio galaxies . as the size and luminosity of these radio - loud labs ( rllab ) show correlation with their radio activities , the formation mechanisms of labs are thought to be mainly related to their radio and agn activities",
    ". however , the formation mechanisms of the diffuse outer parts of the nebulae may be different from those of the bright central part related to agn activities , since the outer parts of the nebulae show more quiescent kinematics than the central part and show more varied structures , such as filaments and bubbles @xcite . since the 2000",
    "s , labs lacking strong radio sources or agn have been discovered ( radio - quiet lab , or rqlab , * ? ? ?",
    ". rqlabs also show filamentary and bubble - like structures , and the morphology of the outer parts of rllabs and rqlabs are very similar @xcite . although at least three possible ideas , such as cold gas accretion , galactic winds , and photoinonization by intense star - bursts or by obscured agn , have been proposed to explain the formation mechanisms of the rqlabs @xcite , there is no consensus yet @xcite .",
    "both rllabs and rqlabs often have bright sub - millimeter ( sub - mm ) sources and reside in overdense regions , they could be linked to massive galaxy formation in overdense environments .",
    "it is possible that rllabs and rqlabs are closely related objects , but this relation is still unclear .",
    "while giant labs are very rare objects , protoclusters and the surrounding large - scale structures often contain multiple giant labs .",
    "the number densities of 100 kpc - scale labs have been estimated to be @xmath9 mpc@xmath10 from several blind surveys for labs @xcite . despite this rarity ,",
    "the ssa22 protocluster at @xmath11 contains two @xmath12 kpc rqlabs with a spatial separation of @xmath13 comoving mpc @xcite .",
    "the ssa22 protocluster is located at the central part of a filamentary large - scale structure with spatial extents of @xmath14 comoving mpc @xcite .",
    "this structure also contains more than @xmath15 smaller ( @xmath16 kpc ) rqlabs @xcite .",
    "the protocluster associated with a 250 kpc rllab , mrc1138262 also contains a 80 kpc rqlab with a spatial separation of @xmath17 comoving mpc .    what is the difference between rllabs and rqlabs ? is there any difference between the local environments of rqlabs and rllabs ? is it common that giant rl and rqlabs reside in the same structure ?",
    "until now , there has been no wide - field ly@xmath0 imaging observation around rllabs comparable to the ssa22 protocluster survey .",
    "we selected one of the most well - studied hzrgs , b3j2330 + 3927 at @xmath1 , which was known to have a ly@xmath0 nebulae with an extent of at least @xmath18 from the previous long slit spectroscopy and thus is a possible candidate for a giant rllab .",
    "b3j2330 + 3927 has possible evidence that it resides in an overdense environment of galaxies .",
    "the jcmt / scuba observations of b3j2330 + 3927 showed that it has at least two possible companion sub - mm sources lying within @xmath19 comoving mpc @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the ly@xmath0 of b3j2330 + 3927 falls on almost the central wavelength of the @xmath20 filter , which was originally made for the ssa22 @xmath11 protocluster observations @xcite .",
    "here we present results of our ly@xmath0 imaging observation around b3j2330 + 3927 with the @xmath20 .    in this letter ,",
    "we use ab magnitudes and adopt cosmological parameters , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 km s@xmath24 mpc@xmath24 . in this cosmology , the universe at @xmath25 is 2.0 gyr old and @xmath26 corresponds to a physical length of 7.6 kpc at @xmath25 .",

    "the rqlab has an extent of @xmath41 ( 100 kpc ) and it is one of the largest labs known to date .",
    "the rqlab has two ly@xmath0 peaks and was initially detected as two different laes .",
    "b3j2330 + 3927 also has giant ly@xmath0 nebula with an extent of @xmath42 ( 130 kpc ) .",
    "we listed the properties of these two labs in table  2 .",
    "the ly@xmath0 luminosities and observed ly@xmath0 equivalent widths are measured using isophotal apertures with a threshold of @xmath43 erg s@xmath24 @xmath35 arcsec@xmath36 ( the lowest contours in fig .  4 ) .",
    "we have confirmed that there is no other prominent lab in this field except for these two labs , searching for labs with the detection threshold of @xmath43 erg s@xmath24 @xmath35 arcsec@xmath36 and the selection criteria of @xmath44 mag , @xmath45 mag , isophotal area @xmath46 arcsec@xmath38 .",
    "we have also confirmed that the results do not change significantly if we use different mesh sizes for sky - subtraction in the data reduction process .",
    "we discovered a new candidate 100 kpc rqlab , which appears to lie in the same large - scale structure around the rllab , b3j2330 + 3927 .",
    "this discovery is unlikely to be serendipitous .",
    "if we use the upper limit of the number density of 100 kpc - scale labs from previous blind surveys for labs at @xmath47 @xcite , the estimated probability to find a new 100 kpc lab in the survey volume of our observation is only @xmath48 .",
    "thus it is more likely that this large - scale structure is a special environment for labs to form .",
    "however , we need spectroscopic redshifts of the new rqlab and the large - scale structure to investigate whether the new rqlab and the rllab are really in the same structure or not .    on smaller scales ,",
    "the new rqlab appears to lie in the local density peak in the large - scale structure , while the rllab , b3j2330 + 3927 does not .",
    "there are two possible interpretations of the difference of the local environments of these two labs .",
    "firstly , rqlab may need a prominent ( @xmath8 ) density peak of galaxies to form through intense star - bursts due to frequent galaxy interactions / mergers and/or continuous gas accretion in an overdense environment .",
    "the prototypes of rqlabs , ssa22 lab1 and lab2 are also known to reside in overdensities of star - forming galaxies of greater than @xmath8 @xcite . on the other hand , rllab may not always need a prominent density peak to form if it is mainly powered by its radio and agn activities .",
    "alternatively , both rqlab and rllab may need prominent density peaks to form but we could not completely trace the density of galaxies because we missed evolved and dusty galaxies in our survey .",
    "b3j2330 + 3927 has two possible sub - mm companions although neither has a lae / laa counterpart @xcite .",
    "thus it is still possible that b3j2330 + 3927 is associated with an overdense region of evolved and dusty galaxies .",
    "future deep , wide - field nir and sub - mm observations will be useful to investigate these possibilities by providing a complete map including evolved and dusty galaxies in these environments .",
