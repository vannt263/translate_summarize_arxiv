    "in recent years it has become increasingly evident that a convenient way to study systems constituted of many interacting elements is by associating to each element a node and to each interaction a link between nodes , giving a _ network _ ( or graph ) .",
    "it has been widely noted that complex interconnected structures appear in a wide variety of systems of high technological and intellectual importance .",
    "it has been pointed out that many such networks are disordered but not completely random @xcite . on the contrary",
    ", they have intrinsic hierarchies and characteristic organizations which are distinguishable and are preserved during the network evolution . in particular , one of the principal feature of these networks is the fact that they are both _ clustered _ and _",
    "connected_. for instance , an individual in a social network has most links within his own local circle , yet each individual in the world is only at a few steps from any other @xcite .",
    "an example of a completely clustered network is a triangular lattice on a planar surface : in such a network each one of the @xmath0 nodes is connected with its local neighbors only and the average distance between two individuals scales as @xmath1 .",
    "this is a ` large world ' . on the other hand , after erdos and rnyi @xcite , we know that random graphs are closely connected systems where the average distance scales as @xmath2 : a ` small world ' .",
    "intermediate structures can be constructed from the planar lattice by adding links between distant nodes making in this way _ short cuts_. but such an insertion of a short - cut on the triangular lattice has an important consequence : the network can no longer be drawn on the plane without edge crossings ; it is non - planar .",
    "the embedding surface must be modified accordingly by creating a ` worm hole ' which connects two distant parts of the surface and through which the new link can ` travel ' .",
    "such ` worm holes ' create short - cut tunnels in the ( 2d ) universe transforming it into a small world .    in this paper",
    "we explore the idea of a network that exists , grows and evolves on a hyperbolic surface .",
    "the complexity of the network itself is in this way associated with the complexity of the surface and the evolution of the network is now constrained to a given overall topological organization .",
    "more precisely , we explore the relation between the properties of a network and its embedding on a surface .",
    "an orientable surface ( an intersection - free , two - sided , two - dimensional submanifold of three - dimensional euclidean space ) can be topologically classified in term of its _ genus _ which is the largest number of non - intersecting simple closed cuts that can be made on the surface without disconnecting a portion ( equal to the number of handles in the surface ) .",
    "the genus ( @xmath3 ) is a good measure of complexity for a surface : under such a classification , the sphere ( @xmath4 ) is the simplest system ; the torus is the second - simpler ( @xmath5 ) ; etc . to a given network",
    "can always be assigned a genus : defined to be equal to the minimum number of handles that must be added to the plane to _ embed _ the graph without edge - crossings .",
    "( accordingly , a planar graph has genus 0 and it can be `` minimally '' embedded on the sphere ) .",
    "therefore , our approach works in two ways : it is a convenient tool to generate graphs with given complexity ( genus ) and/or it is a useful instrument to measure the complexity of real - world graphs .    the aim of the present paper is to emphasize _ why _ it is convenient to study networks in term of their embeddings on a surface . we find several attractive features of this approach : 1 ) it provides new measures to characterize complexity ; 2 ) it gives a locally - planar representation ; 3 ) it provides a hierarchical ensemble classification ; 4 ) it allows the application of topologically invariant elementary moves @xcite . in addition",
    ", let us stress that _ any _ network can be embedded on a surface , therefore :",
    "_ why not?_.",
    "in this section we discuss the embeddings of _ undirected _ , _ simple _ graphs ( with at most one edge connecting any two vertices and each edge connecting two vertices ) on orientable surfaces of genus @xmath3 .",
    "first consider the _ complete _ graph with @xmath0 vertices ( @xmath6 ) . in @xmath6 ,",
    "all possible links are present and each node is connected with all other @xmath7 nodes .",
    "evidently , any graph with @xmath0 nodes is necessarily a sub - graph of @xmath6 .",
    "it is known @xcite that an embedding of @xmath6 is always possible on an orientable surface @xmath8 of genus @xmath9 , with @xmath10 ( for @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the ceiling function which returns the smallest integer number @xmath13 ) . for @xmath14 one",
    "has @xmath15 , and hyperbolic surfaces are needed to embed the complete graph .",
    "when @xmath16 0 , 3 , 4 or 7 ( mod 12 ) the quantity @xmath17 is divisible by 12 and the embedding of @xmath6 on @xmath18 is a regular _ triangular _ tiling .    eq.[g * ] states that any graph with @xmath0 nodes ( any sub - graph of @xmath6 ) can be embedded on a surface of genus larger of equal than @xmath19 .",
    "however sub - graphs of @xmath6 might be embeddable on surfaces with smaller genus .",
    "the embedding of the complete graph on @xmath18 has the desirable feature of local planarity .",
    "note , however , that this local simplification is achieved by introducing complexity in the global surface ( @xmath19 scales with @xmath20 ) .",
    "constructions of embeddings of sub - graph of @xmath6 on topologically simpler surfaces ( with lower genus than @xmath19 ) are therefore required .    in this paper",
    "we discuss three distinct constructions : _ bottom - up _ ; _ top - down _ and _ dynamical_. these methods ( described below ) are algorithmically very different , yet they can produce the same final structures .",
    "the * bottom - up * approach is an iterative construction on a surface @xmath8 of given genus @xmath3 .",
    "it starts from a set of @xmath0 unconnected nodes and connects two nodes if and only if the resulting graph can be embedded on @xmath8 .",
    "this process proceeds iteratively and terminates with either a triangular graph containing @xmath21 links ( when @xmath22 ) , or the complete graph @xmath6 ( when @xmath23 ) .",
    "this construction gives _ maximal networks _",
    ", with a maximum number of links for a graph with @xmath0 vertices on @xmath8 .",
    "less connected graphs can be constructed by edge - pruning or by ending the construction process at an earlier stage .",
    "applications of this method to financial market data for the case @xmath4 are discussed in @xcite ( interest rates data ) and @xcite ( stock market data ) .",
    "the * top - down * construction starts from the embedding of @xmath6 on @xmath18 .",
    "we then roll this multi - handled surface on its ( topologically planar ) _",
    "universal cover_. most commonly , the universal cover lies in the hyperbolic plane @xmath24 ( except where @xmath25 ) @xcite .",
    "the resulting pattern exhibits discrete symmetries , characteristic of a regular tiling of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "in particular the special cases @xmath26 ( mod 12 ) lead to regular tilings of @xmath24 with schlfli symbols @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this procedure effectively `` unzips '' the multi - handled surface , and forms multiple planar copies in the hyperbolic plane . an example for @xmath28 ( related to the case in @xcite ) is shown in fig.[f.complete ] . in this case",
    "@xmath29 ( eq.[g * ] ) and the figure represents the embedding of @xmath30 by unfolding @xmath31 on the universal cover .",
    "this is one possible embedding among the exponentially - large class of allowed embeddings @xcite .",
    "once we have formed the universal cover , we can proceed in the inverse direction by edge pruning @xmath24 followed by re - gluing the universal cover into a simpler surface , @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the * dynamical * construction starts from a simple seed network on @xmath8 and then allows it to evolve by elementary moves that re - wire links and add or remove nodes under the constraint that the resulting network remains a simple graph embedded on @xmath8 .",
    "this approach allows us to construct ensembles of graphs which share a common embedding .",
    "we find that the properties of the resulting graphs are related to the properties of @xmath8 .",
    "this is discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "here we further restrict our investigations to triangular embeddings . consider the effect of cascades of elementary moves of two types : _ edge switching _ ( t1 ) and _ vertex insertion and removal _ ( t2 ) @xcite .",
    "the first operation is a local elementary move which switches the connections among four nodes as indicated in fig.[f.t1t2 ] .",
    "the operation switches neighbors : two first - neighboring nodes become second - neighbors ( @xmath33 in the figure ) whereas two second - neighbors become first - neighbours ( @xmath34 in the figure ) .",
    "this @xmath35 operation can be iterated allowing the exploration of a large class of triangular embeddings on @xmath8 .",
    "however , certain triangulations of oriented surfaces can not be transformed into each other by @xmath35 operations alone . the second elementary operation ( @xmath36 )",
    "is the insertion of a vertex in the middle of an existing triangle and its inverse , as drawn in fig.[f.t1t2 ] .",
    "it is known that any triangulation on @xmath8 can be transformed into any other by a sequence of @xmath35 and @xmath36 elementary moves @xcite .",
    "applications of this technique to the case @xmath5 are discussed in @xcite .",
    "consider next examples of large triangulations ( containing up to @xmath37 nodes ) embedded on surfaces of various genera . for convenience ,",
    "we consider values of @xmath3 between 0 and @xmath0 + 1 , as the latter bound allows networks with integer connectivity ( 18 ) irrespectively of their size .",
    "these networks are generated via the `` dynamical method '' introduced above .",
    "we start with a seed - graph and then apply @xmath35 moves at random .",
    "the result is a disordered network .",
    "remarkably , for the case @xmath4 the degree distribution is known analytically ( @xmath38 ) @xcite : @xmath39 $ ] , which , in the tail region , is well described by an exponential law @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "such theoretical behavior is confirmed numerically by our simulations using the ` dynamical ' construction . at low genus , the degree distribution decreases exponentially with @xmath42 ( linear trend in log - normal scale ) , as shown in fig.[f.degrees](a ) .",
    "however , it is also evident from the figure that when @xmath3 increases the coefficient @xmath43 decreases and the distributions tails become ` fatter ' .",
    "moreover , log - log plots of the degree distributions of networks embedded on high - genus surfaces reveal power - law behaviors for small - medium values of the connectivity ( fig.[f.degrees](b ) ) .",
    "we find in those cases very good fits of the distributions to the functional form : @xmath44 .",
    "( for the case in fig.[f.degrees ] with @xmath45 and @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 . )",
    "this ` stretching ' of the degree distributions away from exponential behavior ( characteristic of low genus ) towards power - law behavior ( with an exponential cutoff ) suggests the presence of a phase - transition when the number of handles in the surface becomes comparable with the number of nodes .",
    "indeed , it was shown in @xcite that the behavior at @xmath5 can be retrieved easily by modelling the system as non - interacting nodes constrained by a global condition on the average connectivity ( which must be equal to 6 at @xmath5 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "networks embedded on topologically complex surfaces allow longer - range correlations to play a crucial role in the system organization , leading to non - boltzmann distributions .",
    "another important effect associated with the variation of genus of the embedding surface concerns the intrinsic ( or fractal ) dimension of the network .",
    "we infer this dimensional measure from the average length ( @xmath50 ) of the geodesic paths on the network between any pair of nodes .",
    "if this topological length scales with the total number of nodes ( the ` volume ' ) as @xmath51 , one can define an intrinsic dimension @xmath52 for the system .",
    "( this definition is analogous to standard scaling laws in @xmath52-dimensional lattices . )",
    "another possible definition of intrinsic dimensionality follows from analysis of the average number of nodes ( @xmath53 ) at a given geodesic distance ( @xmath54 ) from a central node @xcite . indeed , in systems with finite intrinsic dimensionality",
    ", we expect such a topological ` perimeter ' to grow with topological radius as : @xmath55 .",
    "clearly , there are various possible definitions for the intrinsic dimension and , in general , they can lead to different results .",
    "however we verified that the two definitions above lead to the same result for all the cases examined .",
    "interestingly , results associated with the application of the regge calculus in 2d quantum gravity @xcite show that for @xmath4 the intrinsic dimension of random triangulations must be @xmath56 .",
    "we verified that our numerical simulations for the case @xmath4 are very well described with the functional forms @xmath57 and @xmath58 with @xmath59 .",
    "we have also verified that the same forms hold for all the small - genus cases ( when @xmath60 ) , again with @xmath61 .",
    "therefore we affirm that for small genus the system has a finite intrinsic dimension and it behaves as a _ large world_. at the opposite limit we know that for very high genus ",
    "when @xmath19 is neared and the network approaches @xmath6  we attain saturation : @xmath62 .",
    "we have detected a critical region , in the vicinity of @xmath63 , where the intrinsic dimension diverges . in this region",
    "we observe that the system becomes a _ small world _ with : @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we expect to observe another transition to ultra - small worlds ( @xmath66 ) when the genus approaches @xmath19 . but this will be the topic of a forthcoming paper .",
