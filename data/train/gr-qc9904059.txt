    "the early years of the next millennium will hopefully be remembered for the birth of gravitational - wave astronomy . with several large scale interferometers ( ligo , virgo , geo600 , tama ) under construction , and the continued improvement of the technology for cryogenic resonant - mass detectors ( allegro , auriga , explorer , nautilus ) ,",
    "there are many reasons to be optimistic at the present time .",
    "however , the interpretation of data from the new generation of detectors will heavily depend on accurate `` templates '' of gravitational wave - forms . for a given astrophysical source of gravitational radiation , construction of such templates involves fully non - linear or perturbative approximations to einstein s field equations . in both instances ,",
    "the construction of appropriate initial data constitutes a fundamental issue .",
    "it is absolutely necessary that initial data represent a `` realistic '' stage of the astrophysical system under consideration .",
    "the early years of numerical relativity were in part characterized by studies aimed at constructing initial data for einstein s equations , namely data that satisfies the hamiltonian and momentum constraints .",
    "of particular interest was obtaining solutions to the constraints which represent black hole binaries @xcite .",
    "these initial data studies highlighted the importance that lichnerowicz - york s conformal approach @xcite plays in facilitating solving the constraints .",
    "in the perturbative arena , initial data sets also play a fundamental role if a connection with systems of astrophysical relevance is to be made .",
    "examples of perturbative studies where astrophysically consistent initial data is needed are the point - particle @xcite and close - limit approximations @xcite to black hole coalescences . for the close - limit approximation in particular ,",
    "this issue is crucial .",
    "the focus is then on the late stage of the merger , when the binary system can be approximated as a single , perturbed black hole . in the case of perturbations of relativistic stars ,",
    "most of the studies @xcite have not considered initial data with direct connection to a given astrophysical situation . in other words",
    ", the focus has so far been on investigating how the star reacts to generic perturbations .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide a mechanism for generating initial data for perturbations of a relativistic star .",
    "this data should ideally represent astrophysical situations of relevance to gravitational - wave detectors .",
    "inspired by the success that lichnerowicz - york s conformal approach has enjoyed for solving einstein s constraints , we base our methodology on `` linearizing lichnerowicz - york s procedure '' . by doing so , we take advantage of the prescription for knowing which pieces of information , among the metric and its `` velocity '' , are fixed by the constraints and which are freely specifiable .",
    "moreover , we inherit the machinery used in the past for the construction of initial data sets representing binary systems .",
    "that is , the procedure described in this paper provides a natural framework for obtaining initial data in connection with the close - limit approximation to neutron star mergers @xcite . as with black hole binaries , the close - limit to neutron star collisions deals with the late stages of the merger , at the point in which the systems can be approximated as",
    "a single neutron star `` dressed '' with perturbations .",
    "given a spacetime with 4-metric @xmath0 and a foliation of this spacetime with eulerian observers having a 4-velocity @xmath1 , the constraints in einstein s fields equations can be written in a 3 + 1 ( or adm ) form @xcite as r + k^2 - k_ij k^ij & = 16 & [ eq : ham ] + _ j(k^ij - h^ij k ) & = 8j^i . & [ eq : mom ] above , @xmath2 is the 3-metric ( @xmath3 ) and @xmath4 the extrinsic curvature of the time - like hypersurfaces in the foliation , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 the scalar curvature .",

    "the fundamental virtue of lichnerowicz - york s conformal approach @xcite for solving the hamiltonian and momentum constraints is that it provides a concrete recipe for singling out which four `` pieces '' among the twelve components @xmath15 ) are to be solved from eqs .",

    "the starting point is the ansatz h_ij = ^4 h_ij , [ eq : anzats ] where the conformal metric @xmath16 is assumed to be known .",
    "thus , for the metric , the piece that is fixed by the constraints ( hamiltonian ) is the conformal factor @xmath17 .",
    "the other three quantities fixed by the constraints ( momentum ) involve the extrinsic curvature .",
    "the idea here is to decompose the extrinsic curvature into its trace , tracefree - transverse and tracefree - longitudinal parts . to achieve this ,",
    "the extrinsic curvature is first split into k^ij = a^ij + h^ij k. [ eq : kij ] before decomposing the tracefree part @xmath18 into its transverse and longitudinal parts , the following conformal transformation is applied : a^ij = ^-10 a^ij .",

    "this property simplifies the conformal transformation of the divergence of the extrinsic curvature in the momentum constraint ( [ eq : mom ] ) .",
    "since , as will become clear below , the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath20 is not fixed by the constraints , no conformal transformation is imposed on the trace of the extrinsic curvature ( @xmath21 )",

    "the freely specifiable data in this coupled set of equations are the conformal metric @xmath16 , the trace of the extrinsic curvature @xmath26 , the source functions @xmath27 , and the divergence free , traceless part of the extrinsic curvature @xmath28 , which is hidden in @xmath22 in eq .",

    "the corresponding decomposition of the conformal space quantities yields : h_ij & = & h_ij^(0 ) + h_ij^(1 ) + & = & ^(0 ) + ^(1 ) + a^ij _ * & = & a^ij_*(0 ) + a^ij_*(1 ) + w^i & = & w^i_(0 ) + w^i_(1 ) + k & = & k^(0 ) + k^(1 ) + & = & ^(0 ) + ^(1 ) + j^i & = & j^i_(0 ) + j^i_(1 ) , where h_ij^(0 ) & = & ^4_(0 ) h_ij^(0 ) + h_ij^(1 ) & = & ^4_(0 ) h_ij^(1 ) + 4 ^ 3_(0)_(1)h_ij^(0 ) + a^ij_(0 ) & = & ^-10_(0 ) a^ij_(0 ) + a^ij_(1 ) & = & ^-10_(0 ) a^ij_(1 ) - 10 ^ -11_(0)_(1)a^ij_(0 ) + k_(0 ) & = & k_(0 ) + k_(1 ) & = & k_(1 ) + _ ( 0 ) & = & ^-8_(0)_(0 ) + _ ( 1 ) & = & ^-8_(0)_(1 ) - 8 ^ -9_(0)_(1)_(0 ) + j^i_(0 ) & = & ^-10_(0)j^i_(0 ) + j^i_(1 ) & = & ^-10_(0)j^i_(1 ) -10 ^ -11_(0)_(1 ) j^i_(0 ) .",
    "although all scalars , vectors and tensors are expanded in order of smallness , it is important to stress again that all but @xmath17 and @xmath25 are freely specifiable , and this property is independent of the order of the perturbation .    at this point",
    "we introduce our _ second _ assumption , which is that the perturbations of the conformal background vanish on the initial data slice ; that is , @xmath32 . the primary motivation for this choice is the simplification of the coupled system of constraint equations .",
    "we shall later discuss the physical relevance , as well as the implications and restrictions , that this assumption imposes on the class of initial data that one has access to with our procedure .",

    "( [ eq : haml ] ) and ( [ eq : moml ] ) , we have used the fact that the zeroth - order quantities satisfy the constraints . notice",
    "that , as in the non - linear case , the constraints remain coupled .",
    "we now focus on constructing initial data sets for which the background is a static and spherically symmetric stellar model , with 4-metric given by ds^2 = -e^2dt^2 + e^2dr^2 + r^2d^2 + r^2 ^2 d ^2 , [ eq:4metric ] where the metric coefficients @xmath35 and @xmath36 are functions of the radial coordinate @xmath37 only .",
