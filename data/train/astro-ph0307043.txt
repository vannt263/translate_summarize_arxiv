    "extended nebulosities around quasars were investigated by several groups using various facilities from the ground ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . all together",
    "these works have confirmed the presence of the host galaxies .",
    "however their full characterization has been always problematic because the extreme luminosities of quasars tended to outshine the surrounding faint nebulosity .",
    "in fact the ability to measure the global parameters of the host galaxy depends on the shape of the point spread function ( psf ) , throughput of the instrument , also on the distance and on the nuclear - to - host ratio of the sources .",
    "a significant gain to cope with these problems was obtained from high quality ( sub - arcsec ) imaging secured in the near - ir where the contrast between nucleus and host become more favorable .",
    "nevertheless , the non - homogeneity of ground based data and the modest number of studied sources have prevented to produce a satisfactory picture of the properties of the quasar hosts .",
    "in particular the issue of distinguishing between elliptical and spiral / disc galaxies remained unsettled .",
    "a major impetus in this field came from the observations obtained with hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "this is because its narrow psf allows one to distinguish with unprecedented clearness the host galaxy from the nucleus .",
    "the advantage is especially important for low redshift ( z @xmath00.5 ) objects where the signal from the host galaxy is sufficiently high , while at high redshift , in spite of the excellent psf , the small throughput of the 2.5 m aperture telescope becomes the main limitation for these studies .",
    "this kind of programs was indeed among the original scientific motivations of the hst project .    thus far",
    "a number of projects aimed at the study of qso hosts at low redshift have been performed with hst ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; kirhakos et al 1999 ; @xcite ) .",
    "these images indicate that radio loud quasars ( rlqs ) hosts are giant ellipticals , while radio quiet quasars ( rqqs ) are hosted both in ellipticals and spirals .",
    "although the samples of investigated rlq and rqq are still small and rarely defined in a homogeneous way there is a clear tendency for rlq hosts to be more luminous ( by @xmath50.5 mag ) with respect to the rqq hosts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    because of the association of rlq with massive spheroids",
    "these sources have received particular attention since from the properties of their host galaxy one can estimate the mass of the central black hole ( @xmath3 ) using the relationship between @xmath3 and bulge luminosity ( e.g. @xcite ) derived from nearby galaxies with measured bh masses and assuming that the relations holds unchanged up to z @xmath6 0.5 .    in order to improve the size of the sample and to explore a wider range of properties of rlqs we searched the hst archive for unpublished images of low redshift quasars , finding images for 11 objects . in this work we present the results of the image analysis of these objects and",
    "in particular derive the properties of their host galaxies . the new data on rlq host galaxies are then combined with previous published results in order to form the largest ( 34 sources ) and homogeneous data set of rlq hosts investigated by hst .",
    "we discuss here the properties of the full sample . in order to be consistent with our previous papers we choose h@xmath7=50 km sec@xmath8 mpc@xmath8 , q@xmath7=0 .",
    "we carried on a search for non - proprietary images of rlq obtained with wfpc2 from the hst archive . to this",
    "aim the agn catalogue of @xcite was cross correlated with the hst - wfpc2 pointings using multi mission archive at space telescope ( _ mast _ , http://archive.stsci.edu/index.html ) to find out all possible observed sources which were unpublished at the time of the search or where the issue of the host galaxy properties was not examined .",
    "we considered only objects with @xmath9 , m@xmath10 @xmath0 -23.0 and exposures longer than 200 sec .",
    "the result of this search produced a total of 11 objects satisfying the above criteria ( see table 1 ) .",
    "these objects are distributed in the redshift range z= 0.184 to z=0.425 ( average @xmath11 = 0.346 @xmath12 0.083 ) .",
    "the distribution of the objects over the plane @xmath13 ",
    "m@xmath10 is shown in fig .  1 and compared with previous published objects .",
    "the 11 objects span a range in nuclear luminosity from m@xmath10 = -23.1 to m@xmath10 = -26.9 .    for each object hst archive observations include typically 3 - 4 individual images of the quasar calibrated using the hst - wfpc2 pipeline .",
    "these were combined with the iraf task crrej to remove cosmic rays and improve the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the analysis of the qso images followed the procedures described in @xcite for the study of host galaxies of bl lac objects .",
    "in particular we have extracted the azimuthally averaged radial profile of each object after masking any region that are contaminated by companion objects .",
    "this procedure offers the advantage to improve significantly the s / n , allowing to extend the photometry to larger radii but on the other hand two dimensional information is lost . since",
    "our main aim here is to derive the global properties ( morphology , luminosity and scale length ) of the host galaxies this approach is appropriate .",
    "the key ingredient for the optimal decomposition of the qso profiles is the choice of the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "it is well known that while the inner part ( radius @xmath0 2 arcsec ) of the psf can be properly modeled by a specific software ( tiny tim , hereafter tt ; krist & hook , 1999 ) the external fainter halo produced by the scattered light can not .",
    "therefore as in @xcite we adopted here a composite psf , adding to the tt psf an additional smooth component to take into account the effect of the scattered light .",
    "the latter component gives a significant contribution to the wings of the psf at radii larger than 2 - 3 arcsec . since the signal from our targets may extend up to 5 arcsec from the nucleus , neglecting this contribution for the wings of the psf may produce spurious host galaxy images ( see an example in @xcite ) .",
    "the smooth component is modelled by an exponential law and has been adjusted in such a way to yield a good representation of the radial brightness profiles of stars observed by wfpc2 .",
    "since the original observations refer to different filters and cameras we adopted the above procedure to obtain a representative psf for each camera / filter combination . in figure 2 we show an example of the adopted psf , compared with that derived solely from tt model and with the average radial profiles of stars .    in figure 3",
    "we show the images of the quasars after subtraction of a scaled psf .",
    "the normalization of the psf was set to match the flux of the observed target in an annulus of external radius 0.4 arcsec and excluding the pixels within 0.1 arcsec from the center of each object .",
    "these psf subtracted images give an idea of the extended component and the immediate environment of the quasars . in most cases",
    "the nebulosity appears smooth and with a round shape .",
    "no clear signature of spiral structures is detected in agreement with previous hst studies of rlq hosts .    to determine the parameters of the quasar hosts we modelled the observed radial brightness profile of each quasar image by superposing a central point source ( modelled by the psf ) to a galaxy model ( an elliptical or an exponential disk ) convolved with its proper psf .",
    "the fit implies three free parameters ( normalization of the psf and galaxy model plus the scale length of the host galaxy ) .",
    "the best decomposition was obtained by a @xmath14 minimization algorithm varying the three parameters ( see table 2 ) .",
    "we applied this procedure for both models ( elliptical and disk galaxies ) and found that in all cases the fit with an elliptical is better or very close to that of a disk model . in no case",
    "a significantly better fit with a disk model was obtained .",
    "therefore , in agreement with previous studies of rlq and with appearance of the sources in the images , we adopt the parameters of an elliptical galaxy model in the following discussion .",
    "the results of the fit are reported in table 2 .",
    "since the observations pertain to different filters we have transformed all apparent magnitudes into the r ( cousins ) standard band .",
    "to do this we used the prescription reported by @xcite where the magnitudes in the hst filters ( f555w , f606w , f702w , f814w ) are converted into the johnson - cousin system in the v , r and i band .",
    "we also applied a correction ( @xmath15 ) to make the zero points , obtained within @xmath16 arcsec radius aperture , applicable for surface photometry ( @xcite . to obtain uniform and comparable results apparent magnitudes are then converted to r(cousin ) filter assuming v - r=0.61 r - i=0.70 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainty on each parameter has been evaluated from its variation within the @xmath14 map of two parameters and assuming a @xmath17 = 2.7 .",
    "the typical uncertainty for the host and nucleus luminosity is 0.3 mag . on the other hand ,",
    "consistently with previous works ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) we find that the magnitude of the hosts are much better constrained than their effective radii , for which the uncertainty can be as large as 50% .",
    "all the quasars in the considered sample ( see table 1 ) are well resolved . in figure 4",
    "we show for each object the radial brightness profile together with its best fit with the elliptical model .    to check the consistency of our adopted procedure with that of previous studies using a two dimensional fitting procedure , we have analyzed some rlq observed with hst by @xcite . of the 10 rlq examined by these authors we randomly chose 5 objects ( 1020 - 103 , 1217 + 023 , 2135 - 147 , 2141 + 175 , 2247 + 140 ) and found the apparent magnitude of the host galaxy always agrees within @xmath18 m = 0.2 and the effective radii within 30% .    using the parameters of the fit",
    "reported in table 2 we derived the absolute magnitudes and effective radii of the host galaxies ( see table 3 ) .",
    "these absolute magnitudes have been corrected for galactic extinction ( @xcite ) , and k - corrected following @xcite .",
    "nuclear luminosities have been k - corrected using the relationship @xmath19 ( @xmath20 = 0.3 ) and color corrected using data from @xcite .      in order to investigate the properties of the host galaxies of low redshift rlq",
    "we have combined the new 11 objects discussed in this paper with previous data already published in the literature .",
    "the whole data set has been treated homogeneously in terms of cosmology , k  -  correction , filter and galactic extinction as specified above .    to the objects presented here we added the 18 rlq observed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite which were treated homogeneously by falomo et al 2003a .",
    "moreover we included the five rlq at z @xmath0 0.5 studied by @xcite . for the latter we used the reported r apparent magnitudes and transformed them into absolute quantities following our procedure .",
    "the final combined sample consists of 34 objects which is up to now the largest sample of rlq observed by hst .",
    "the main properties of these sources are given in table 3 .",
    "although the sample can not be considered complete because original selections were not homogeneous and in some cases not well defined , we belive that there is no significant bias as far as the host galaxy properties are concerned . therefore we are confident that these sources can yield a trusty picture of the general properties of rlq hosts at low redshift .",
    "we find that the average absolute mag of the full sample of rlq is @xmath1 , and the effective radius @xmath21 = 10.5@xmath123.7 kpc .",
    "the distributions of the absolute magnitudes and of the effective radii of the host galaxies are shown in fig 5 .",
    "this result confirms that on average the host of rlq are large and massive ellipticals the luminosity of which is in the range between 2 to 5 l@xmath22 where l@xmath22 is the characteristic luminosity of a schechter function for ellipticals ( @xcite )      the ratio between the nucleus and host galaxy luminosity in the r band ranges between 0.3 and 16 with an average value of 3 ( see also figure 5 ) . a controversial issue concerning a possible relation between nuclear and host galaxy luminosities has emerged from the analysis of resolved quasars .",
    "this relation could be expected if one assumes that the nucleus is emitting at a fixed ratio of the eddington luminosity and that the mass of the central black hole is linked with the host luminosity .",
    "claims of a positive correlations between the two quantities have been proposed by @xcite on the basis of hst quasar images of both rlq and rqq . however ,",
    "this was not confirmed by other authors using different ( but still small ) samples ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover it is worth to note that part of the correlation found by @xcite is due to the systematic difference of absolute magnitudes between rlq and rqq hosts .    using our data set for 34 rlq hosts , that covers a wide range of data in the plane m@xmath23  -  m@xmath24 , we have investigated this issue . in figure 6",
    "we report the points for the full sample of rlq .",
    "the luminosity of the nucleus is distributed over @xmath6 4 magnitudes while that of the host galaxies remains confined within 1 mag around 3l@xmath22 .",
    "we do not find a significant correlation between m@xmath23 and m@xmath24 as indicated by the spearman rank correlation test that yields r@xmath25=0.24 .    using the relationship between @xmath3 and the bulge luminosity by @xcite we have computed the @xmath3 of each quasar ( and therefore its eddington luminosity ) and compared it with the bolometric luminosity of the nucleus .",
    "to transform the observed nuclear luminosity in the r band into bolometric luminosity we adopted a fixed correction of l@xmath26 @xmath27l@xmath28 where l@xmath28 is the monochromatic luminosity of the nuclei in the r band ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath3 of rlq covers the interval between @xmath29 to @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) . in figure 7",
    "we report the estimated bolometric luminosity of the quasars in the sample versus @xmath3 .",
    "it turns out that these objects are emitting with a wide range of eddington factor ( @xmath32 ) , from @xmath33 to values very close ( @xmath34 ) to l = l@xmath35 .",
    "the dispersion of @xmath36 is larger than that expected from the uncertainties of determination of bh masses .",
    "therefore if the scatter of the bolometric correction is small , this suggests that the lack of correlation between nucleus and host luminosity is due to an intrinsic spread of @xmath36 .      basing on a small number of nearby galaxies with known bh masses it was suggested by @xcite that @xmath3 scales with the total radio luminosity @xmath37 at 5  ghz ( @xmath37 @xmath6 @xmath38 ) .",
    "this correlation appears to hold over @xmath63 order of magnitudes for @xmath3 and , given its steepness , it was proposed as a tool to predict @xmath3 from the radio flux .",
    "a similar link between @xmath37 and @xmath3 in various types of active galaxies was claimed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , a recent analysis by @xcite of this relationship indicated that @xmath3 is only loosely related with the radio power .    in figure  [ fig8 ]",
    "we show the data for our sample of rlqs in the plane @xmath39(total ) together with other samples of galaxies at various levels of nuclear activity investigated by @xcite and @xcite and low redshift radio - galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "for rlqs we found no correlation between the two quantities ( spearman correlation coefficient r@xmath25=0.21 ) .",
    "the overall distribution of the agn in the plane @xmath3-p@xmath40 exhibits a trend of larger radio power for increasing @xmath3 but with a very large spread ( 45 orders of magnitude ) .",
    "the fsrq data ( @xcite ) , which appear to deviate from the overall plot , may become consistent with the above trend if the nuclear flux is corrected for doppler boosting . since these bh masses",
    "have been inferred from h@xmath41 width the possible effects of orientation , related to a disk geometry of the line emitting region , could shift the fsrq points in figure 8 to the right ( @xcite ) .",
    "the new data points for rlq together with those of low z rg strengthen the suggestion ( @xcite ) that radio sources of various classes are encompassed by two limits in the @xmath42-@xmath3 plane ( see fig  [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "we have presented the results from the analysis of 11 unpublished wfpc2 images of low redshift rlq retrieved from hst archive .",
    "these data , together with previous hst observations allow us to construct a homogeneous data set of 34 rlq for z@xmath00.5 .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are :    \\1 ) all rlq are hosted in massive elliptical galaxies with luminosity in the range 2 to 5  l@xmath22 .",
    "the average absolute magnitude in the r band @xmath1 .",
    "\\2 ) converting the host galaxy bulge luminosity into bh masses it is found that rlq contain supermassive bh of 10@xmath43 to 10@xmath44 @xmath45",
    "\\3 ) no significant correlation is present between the host and nucleus luminosities ; this suggests that the nuclei are emitting in a large range of regimes , from 1% to @xmath6100% of their eddington luminosity .",
    "\\4 ) the radio power of rlq is not correlated with the central bh mass ; the objects occupy the region of most powerful sources and most massive bh in the overall trend of agn in the @xmath46- @xmath3 plane .",
