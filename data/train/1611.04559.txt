    "the observation that spectra of quantum system may exhibit fractal properties was made first by azbel @xcite but it really caught the imagination when hofstadter @xcite made the structure visible ; then it triggered a long and fruitful investigation of this phenomenon .",
    "on the mathematical side the question was translated into the analysis of the almost mathieu equation which culminated recently in the proof of the `` ten martini problem '' by avila and jitomirskaya @xcite . on the physical side",
    ", the effect remained theoretical for a long time . since the mentioned seminal papers , following an earlier work of peierls @xcite and harper @xcite , the natural setting considered was a lattice in a homogeneous magnetic field because it provided the needed two length scales , generically incommensurable , from the lattice spacing and the cyclotron radius .",
    "the spectrum of the corresponding hamiltonian has fractal properties as one can establish rigorously @xcite by adapting deep results about appropriate difference operators @xcite .",
    "it was not easy to observe the effect , however , and the first experimental demonstration of such a spectral character was done instead in a microwave waveguide system with suitably placed obstacles simulating the almost mathieu relation @xcite .",
    "only recently an experimental realization of the original concept was achieved using a graphene lattice @xcite .",
    "the aim of this note is to show that fractal spectra can arise also in magnetic systems extended in a single direction only under two conditions : the structure should have a nontrivial topology and the magnetic field should vary along it .",
    "we are going to demonstrate this claim using a simple example of a chain graph consisting of an array of identical rings connected at the vertices in the simplest nontrivial way known as the @xmath0 coupling and exposed to the magnetic field perpendicular to the graph plane the intensity of which increases linearly along the chain , with the slope @xmath1 measured in terms of the number of the flux quanta through the ring .",
    "this is the decisive quantity .",
    "it turns out that when @xmath1 is rational , the spectrum has a band - gap structure which allows for description in terms of the floquet - bloch theory . on the other hand , when @xmath1 is irrational , the spectrum is a cantor set , that is , a nowhere dense closed set without isolated points .",
    "the way to prove these results is to translate the original spectral problem into an equivalent one involving a suitable self - adjoint operator on @xmath2 which is a useful and well - known trick in the quantum graph theory , see e.g. @xcite . as a result , in the rational case we rephrase the question as spectral analysis of a simple laurent operator , while in the irrational case we reduce the problem to investigation of the almost mathieu operator , for which the cantor property of the spectrum is known as mentioned above @xcite .",
    "let us briefly describe the contents of the paper . in the next section",
    "we will define properly the operator that serves as the magnetic chain hamiltonian . in sec .",

    "quantum graphs , which is a short name for schrdinger operators the configuration space of which has the structure of a metric graph , are an important class of models in quantum physics .",
    "they are interesting both physically as models of various nanostructures , as well as from the viewpoint of their mathematical properties ; we refer the reader to the recent monograph of berkolaiko and kuchment @xcite for a thorough presentation and a rich bibliography .",
    "one important class is represented by magnetic quantum graphs , cf .",
    "for instance @xcite .",
    "let us describe the particular system we will be interested in .",
    "it is a metric graph @xmath3 consisting of a linear chain of rings of unit radius , centred at equally spaced points laying at a straight line and touching their neighbours at the left and right .",
    "the vertices are parametrized by integers @xmath4 and both the upper edge @xmath5 and lower edge @xmath6 connecting the @xmath7-th vertex @xmath8 and @xmath9-th vertex @xmath10 , which forms the @xmath7-th ring of the graph , are parametrized by intervals @xmath11 directed along the chain . thus , if the initial vertex of an edge @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath13 and the terminal vertex by @xmath14 , then @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we assume that the system is exposed to a magnetic field perpendicular to the graph plane , which in contrast to @xcite is not homogenerous but may vary along the chain .",
    "the hamiltonian is the graph version of the magnetic schrdinger operator acting as @xmath17 at each edge , where @xmath18 stands for the tangential component of the corresponding vector potential at a given point .",
    "however , it is known that in a magnetic chain there are only the fluxes through the loops that count , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2.6.3 ) , and therefore we may , without loss of generality , choose a gauge in which the ( tangent component of the ) vector potential @xmath18 is constant at each particular ring ; we denote by @xmath19 its value at the @xmath7-th ring and by @xmath20 the sequence of all such local vector potentials .",
    "the state hilbert space corresponding to a non - relativistic charged spinless particle confined to the graph @xmath3 is @xmath21 . for a function",
    "@xmath22 we further denote its components on the upper and lower semicircles @xmath5 and @xmath6 of the @xmath7-th ring by @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",

    "]    since the actual values of physical quantities will play no role in the discussion we employ the rational system of units putting @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the hamiltonian is then simply @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the quasi - derivative which depends locally on the parametrisation of the edge and the magnetic field ; specifically , on the upper and lower semicircles of the @xmath7-th chain ring , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , it acts as @xmath31 respectively .    in order to make @xmath32 a well - defined self - adjoint operator we have to specify its domain which entails choosing the boundary conditions satisfied by the functions at the vertices of @xmath3 , in physical terms this means to indicate the coupling between the rings .",
    "we choose for the latter the simplest nontrivial coupling commonly known as @xmath0 .",

    "note the different signs of the quasiderivative @xmath28 at @xmath44 and @xmath45 which reflects the fact that the one - sided derivative at a vertex should be taken in the outgoing direction .",
    "in order to obtain the spectrum of @xmath32 we employ a particular kind of the duality mentioned in the introduction , relating it to the difference operator @xmath46 which is a bounded self - adjoint operator on @xmath2 defined by @xmath47 we employ the results obtained by k.  pankrashkin in ( * ? ? ?",

    "hence , since @xmath86 is bicontinuous in each set @xmath107 , @xmath145 , the preimage @xmath276 ( using the notation from proposition  [ prop : spec : basic_for_original_op ] ) is again a cantor set contained in @xmath118 for @xmath277 and in @xmath268 for @xmath269 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to see that the lebesgue measure of @xmath149 is zero for every @xmath145 which implies that it is zero for the whole set .",
    "now the sought assertion follows from proposition  [ prop : spec : basic_for_original_op ] .",
    "it follows from the previous theorem that the eigenvalues @xmath267 are isolated points of the spectrum of @xmath32 if and only if @xmath116 or @xmath278 or @xmath279 .",
    "finally , we may apply the very recent result of last and shamis @xcite which says that there is a dense set @xmath280 of @xmath1 s , for which the hausdorff dimension of the spectrum of @xmath240 equals zero , @xmath281 , see e.g. @xcite for the definitions of hausdorff measure and dimension .",
    "this result may be applied to the spectrum of @xmath32 as a consequence of the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath213 for some @xmath282 , @xmath235 , and every @xmath215 .",
    "then @xmath283 .",
    "it follows from that @xmath270 . by the discussion preceding proposition [ prop : spec : basic_for_original_op ] and with the same notation , it follows that for any @xmath145 , @xmath149 is contained in some closed subinterval @xmath284 of @xmath107 .",
    "moreover , for @xmath285 the function @xmath86 is bi - lipschitz on @xmath284 .",
    "thus the inverse @xmath286 of its restriction on @xmath284 is again bi - lipschitz .",
    "hence @xmath149 is the image of @xmath275 under bi - lipschitz function @xmath286 .",
    "it is a known fact , that bi - lipschitz mappings preserve hausdorff dimension , see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 2.4 ) .",
    "hence @xmath287 for all @xmath147 . for @xmath288",
    "we may argue similarly for any closed set contained in @xmath289 .",
    "the point @xmath290 should be omitted since @xmath86 is not bi - lipschitz on open sets containing zero .",
    "let @xmath291 be a neighbourhood of @xmath290 .",
    "then @xmath292 is an image of @xmath293 under a bi - lipschitz function @xmath294 .",
    "since @xmath291 was arbitrary , it follows that @xmath295 .",
    "finally , since countable sets have hausdorff dimension zero , the countable stability , see e.g. section 2.2 in @xcite , of hausdorff measures yields the assertion .",
    "thus , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) and , one more assertion follows .",
    "let @xmath213 for some @xmath261 and every @xmath215 .",
    "there exist a dense set @xmath280 , such that for every @xmath296 , @xmath297 for all @xmath218 .",
    "to conclude , recall first that for any irrational @xmath1 and ( lebesgue ) almost all @xmath218 the spectrum of the almost mathieu operator @xmath240 is purely singularly continuous .",
    "this is a part of the more general aubry - andr conjecture proven by jitomirskaya @xcite .",
    "this fact motivates us to the question whether for any irrational @xmath1 the spectrum of @xmath216 has the same property , i.e. whether it is purely singularly continuous for lebesgue a.e . @xmath218 .    a deeper question concerns the physical meaning of the model that involves a magnetic field changing linearly along the chain . a philosophical answer could be , according the known quip of bratelli and robinson , that `` validity of such idealizations is the heart and soul of theoretical physics and has the same fundamental significance as the reproducibility of experimental data '' . on a more mundane level",
    ", one can note that the spectral behaviour will not change if the linear field is replaced by a quasiperiodic one which changes in a saw - tooth - like fashion as long as the jumps coincide with the graph vertices .",
    "this also opens an interesting question about the spectral form and type in case when the saw - tooth shape is replaced by another periodic or quasiperiodic function .",
