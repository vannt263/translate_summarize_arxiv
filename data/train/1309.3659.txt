    "the motion of a spheroid in a viscous incompressible fluid , after a sudden small impulse directed along the symmetry axis , may in principle be calculated from the linearized navier - stokes equations for fluid velocity and pressure , in combination with a boundary condition for the flow velocity at the surface of the spheroid . in the following",
    "we assume that the no - slip boundary condition holds . for a small body",
    "the no - slip condition must be relaxed and replaced by a partial slip boundary condition @xcite .",
    "the added mass tensor , which together with the body mass determines the initial velocity after the impulse , has long been known from the general expressions for an ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "similarly , the steady state friction tensor , which determines the steady state velocity for a constant force , is also known for the general ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "the complete time - dependence of the velocity after a sudden impulse follows in principle by fourier transform from the frequency - dependence of the friction tensor , but this is not known for a general ellipsoid . for axial motion of a spheroid",
    "the frequency - dependent friction coefficient can be found in principle from a set of coupled equations for the multipole moments of the force density induced on the spheroid , as shown first by lai and mockros @xcite .",
    "it was shown by lawrence and weinbaum @xcite , that the equations can be solved efficiently by truncation and matrix inversion .    at low frequency",
    "the friction coefficient for axial motion is linear in the square root of frequency , with a coefficient which can be found from the friction coefficient at zero frequency @xcite@xmath0@xcite . as a consequence of this relation",
    "the velocity relaxation function shows a @xmath1 long - time tail , independent of shape , size , and mass density of the spheroid .",
    "the transient effects on the short and intermediate time scale are less well known .    for the case of a sphere , stokes @xcite derived a simple explicit formula for the frequency - dependent friction coefficient .",
    "the impedance of a sphere is quadratic in the square root of frequency .",
    "the term linear in the square root is relevant both at low and at high frequency .",
    "the corresponding motion of a sphere has been studied by boussinesq @xcite . for a spheroid ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the impedance at high frequency is given by a term linear in frequency , with coefficient given by the sum of spheroid mass and added fluid mass , and a term proportional to the square root of frequency , with a basset coefficient .",
    "lawrence and weinbaum @xcite calculated the latter from an expression derived by landau and lifshitz @xcite and batchelor @xcite for a body of arbitrary shape .",
    "the basset coefficient differs from the coefficient of the term linear in the square root of frequency at low frequency . in previous work",
    "we have calculated the basset coefficient for a general ellipsoid for the three principal directions @xcite .",

    "we examine this idea by comparison with a calculation of the admittance on the basis of the method of pad approximants @xcite .",

    "the frequency - dependent admittance of a prolate or oblate spheroid can be analyzed efficiently by the method of pad approximants applied to the approximate solution of the exact set of coupled equations for the multipole moments of the hydrodynamic force density .",
    "the method leads to an approximate representation of the admittance as a ratio of two polynomials in the square root of frequency .",
    "hence one can evaluate the time - dependent velocity relaxation function as a sum of @xmath108 functions .",
    "we have applied the method to a prolate or oblate spheroid of aspect ratio @xmath67 for two values of the spheroid mass density , and have compared the numerical results with those calculated from the approximation proposed by lawrence and weinbaum @xcite .",
    "the comparison is shown in figs . 1 - 4 .",
    "the figures show that for the cases considered the deviation from the two - pole approximation is quite small , and not well described by the approximation of lawrence and weinbaum @xcite , based on just the basset coefficient .",
    "the elaborate calculation in terms of spheroidal wavefunctions leads to only a small deviation from the result which may be calculated from the steady state friction coefficient and the effective mass , as given by the classical expressions for a general ellipsoid @xcite@xmath0@xcite .",
    "presumably an exact calculation for an ellipsoid would lead to the same conclusion in that case . for many practical purposes @xcite the two - pole approximation to the admittance , as determined from steady state friction coefficient and effective mass , will be sufficient .",
