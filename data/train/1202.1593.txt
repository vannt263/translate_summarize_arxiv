    "through a supernova ( sn ) explosion , huge energy ( typically of the order of @xmath0  erg ) is released in form of the kinetic energy of the ejecta .",
    "since the supernova remnant ( snr ) expands supersonically , shock waves are formed to compress and heat the ejecta and ambient matter .",
    "the shocks generally propagate in an extremely low - density ( @xmath1 1  @xmath2 ) interstellar medium ( ism ) and hence are nearly collisionless ; the shock transition occurs on a length scale much shorter than the typical particle mean free path to coulomb collisions .",
    "therefore , in the early phases of the snr evolution , the shocked plasma is expected to be far from equilibrium in terms of the particle ( electron and ion ) temperatures .",

    "this is , if true , quite peculiar because the heavier elements tend to be less ionized compared to the lighter ones in a normal isothermal plasma .",
    "in fact , the model they used to reproduce the observed spectrum was composed of two rather non - physical plasma components : a cooler one consisting only of si , and a hotter one with extremely over abundant s. in the asca spectrum , however , the he - like and h - like lines were not distinctly separated due to the limited photon statistics and the degraded energy resolution .",

    "the shell - like structure seen in the soft x - ray image originates mainly from the surrounding clouds which are recently shocked by the blast wave ( kawasaki et al .",

    "2009 ) whose aim point was ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) = ( 235.0 , 0.0 ) . to minimize the uncertainty due to the background subtraction , in particular that of the particle component ( non x - ray background ) , we extracted the background spectra from the same detector coordinates as the source regions .",
    "the background - subtracted spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : ic443_full]b .    as mentioned in section  [ ssec : ic443 ] ,",
    "the ionization temperatures of si and s are different from each other ( 1.0  kev and 1.2  kev , respectively ) .",
    "this implies that the single-@xmath6 model , which was applied for g359.10.5 , does not work in this case .",
    "therefore , we used an nei model of spex , where the free parameters are the initial plasma temperature ( @xmath27}$ ] ) , post - shock electron temperature ( @xmath8 ) , ionization timescale ( @xmath3 ) , emission measure ( @xmath28 ) , abundances of different elements , and absorption column ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "the first parameter is usually set to a very low value ( @xmath91  ev , for instance ) to describe a standard underionized nei plasma , but in our case it should be allowed to vary freely and also to be higher than the @xmath8 value for reproducing an overionized plasma.http://www.sron.nl/files/hea/spex/manuals/manual.pdf@xmath30 since the gain calibration of the xis is reported to be problematic around the energy of the si k - edge ( 1.84  kev ) , we ignore the energy range of 1.81.9  kev from the fitting .",
    "the best - fit parameters obtained with this model is given in table  [ ic443_fit ] .",
    "although the fit is unacceptable from a statistical point of view ( @xmath31/dof = 722/430 ) , the overall spectrum was well reproduced by the model consisting only of one plasma component .",
    "it is worth noting that an x - ray spectrum from similarly narrow regions in ic  443 was modeled with at least two components of cie and/or underionized plasmas with different electron temperatures in all the previous works ( e.g. , troja et al .",

    ", however , we found that multiple temperatures are not always needed .",
    "this is because the strong rrcs contribute largely to the continuum flux in the hard x - ray band , even though the slope of the bremsstrahlung emission is steep due to the low ( @xmath90.6  kev ) electron temperature ( see figure  [ fig : ic443_full]b ) .",

    "utilizing the high spectral sensitivity of suzaku , we have discovered recombining ( overionized ) plasmas in the three middle - aged snrs , ic  443 , w49b , and g359.10.5 , for the first time . to date , astronomical recombining plasmas had been observed in relatively compact regions , such as x - ray binaries ( e.g. , cygnus  x-3 : kawashima & kitamoto 1996 ) or planetary nebulae ( e.g. , bd+30@xmath513639 : nordon et al .",

    "if an sn explodes in dense circumstellar matter ( csm ) formed by the progenitor s stellar wind activity , both csm and sn ejecta can be shock - heated to high temperature at the initial phase of the snr s evolution .",
    "furthermore , the plasmas can be in almost cie as they have large electron densities .",
    "such an csm / ejecta interaction and a resultant high - temperature cie plasma were observed in sn  1993j at a few days after the explosion ( kohmura et al .",
    "1994 ; uno et al .",
    "although the shock velocity is significantly decreased by the dense matter , it can quickly recover when the blast wave penetrates into the outer ism region ( itoh & masai 1989 ; a similar suggestion is given by dwarkadas ( 2005 ) , but for shocks passing through more expanded wind - blown shells ) .",
    "if the shocked electrons cool adiabatically much faster than the recombination timescale of the ionized materials , overionized plasma can be formed and survive for a long time .",
    "this picture is supported by our new result on ic  443 where the overionized nei model is applied .",
    "the best - fit parameters we obtained ( table  [ ic443_fit ] ) can be interpreted with the scenario that the 2.8  kev ( @xmath27}$ ] ) plasma in almost cie suddenly cooled down to 0.6  kev ( @xmath8 ) , in the initial evolution phase , to form the recombining state . from the ionization timescale of @xmath59",
    "@xmath2  s , we estimate the time since the sudden cooling to be @xmath60 = @xmath61 @xmath62  yr . although the value is about three times larger than the known age of the remnant ( 4000  yr ; troja et al .  2008 ) , this is not surprising because the actual evolution must be more complex ; both the electron density and temperature are time - dependent .",
    "future works taking into account the realistic evolutions are , therefore , highly encouraged to examine this scenario more precisely .",
    "it should also be noted that an alternative scenario to create the recombining plasma has recently been proposed by zhou et al .",
    "( 2011 ) as an application of hydrodynamic simulation to w49b .",
    "they found that adiabatic expansion causes rapid cooling of the ejecta ( as was argued by itoh & masai 1989 ) but thermal conduction occurring in a mixture of ambient clouds and a hot plasma plays an important role to form the recombining plasma .",
    "this scenario successfully explains the observational result from xmm - newton ( miceli et al .",
    "2010 ) ; the strong overionization is localized at the snr s center whereas no overionized stuff is present in the eastern region where the ejecta expansion is hampered by the molecular cloud .    in table",
    "[ table ] , we summarize the physical parameters of the three snrs with estimates of the recombination timescales ( to reach 90% of cie ) using the calculation by smith & hughes ( 2010 ) . in ic  443 and w49b ,",
    "the timescales are significantly larger than the ages of the remnants . therefore",
    ", both the scenarios of the rapid adiabatic expansion and thermal conduction are supported .",
    "the age of g359.10.5 is currently unknown , but it should be less than about @xmath63  yr if the former scenario is the case .",
    "it is notable that all the three snrs that have shown the recombining plasmas are classified as mixed - morphology ( mm ) snrs ( rho & petre 1998 ) . the mm - snrs are characterized by a centrally - peaked x - ray profile with a more limb - brightened radio morphology .",
    "the x - ray emission is thermal in nature ( in contrast to crab - like pulsar wind nebulae ) , and generally exhibits a relatively uniform radial temperature profile ( e.g. , slane et al .",
    "these properties are in distinct contrast to the expected properties of evolved snrs in a homogeneous ism ; the sedov solution predicts a limb - brightened x - ray morphology and a temperature profile declining steeply from the snr center to the limb .",
    "therefore , more complex theoretical models invoking thermal conduction ( e.g. , shelton et al .",
    "1999 ) or cloud evaporation ( e.g. , white & long 1991 ) have been proposed to explain a mechanism responsible for the observed properties of mm - snrs . however , application of these models to individual snrs has been largely unsuccessful to date ( e.g. , slane et al .  2002 ; bocchino et al .",
    "2009 ) , suggesting that the situation is more complex .",
    "so far , all the theoretical models for mm - snrs have assumed that the plasmas are always in cie .",
    "our new results , however , require a modified picture and strongly constrain any model that can provide a significant amount of overionized materials .",
    "as already mentioned , itoh & masai ( 1989 ) predicted that the recombining plasma can be created if an snr initially evolves in dense csm produced by progenitor s stellar winds .",
    "interestingly , it is suggested that density gradients in pre - existing csm could be a major contributor to the emission profiles in the mm - snrs ( petruk 2001 ) .",
    "all the snrs we have presented are associated with the massive star forming regions ( and thus possibly with type  ii progenitors ) , supporting the presence in the past of stellar wind materials .",
    "future efforts for modeling the mm - snrs , therefore , should properly consider the effects of ism nonuniformity to both the dynamical and ionization evolutions in the snrs .",
    "this will help improve our knowledge about the poorly understood mm - snrs as well as unusual overionized plasmas in this class .",
    "we have discovered the strong rrc emissions from the three mm - snrs , ic  443 , w49b , and g359.10.5 , for the first time .",
    "since plasmas heated by forward or reverse shocks are expected to be ionizing ( underionized ) in usual snrs , this discovery is dramatically changing our understanding of snr dynamics and evolution .",
    "we have also demonstrated that a one - component overionized plasma model can reasonably reproduce the full x - ray band spectrum of ic  443 that has so far been modeled with at least two components of cie and/or underionized nei plasmas . as the origin of the overionization , rapid adiabatic cooling after the interaction between the pre - exiting csm and sn ejecta is proposed . alternatively , thermal conduction may work effectively to form the recombining plasmas in some cases .",

    "<S> we report the discovery of recombining plasmas in three supernova remnants ( snrs ) with the suzaku x - ray astronomy satellite . during snr </S>",
    "<S> s evolution , the expanding supernova ejecta and the ambient matter are compressed and heated by the reverse and forward shocks to form an x - ray emitting hot plasma . since ionization proceeds </S>",
    "<S> slowly compared to shock heating , most young or middle - aged snrs have ionizing ( underionized ) plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> owing to high sensitivity of suzaku , however , we have detected radiative recombination continua ( rrcs ) from the snrs ic  443 , w49b , and g359.10.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the strong rrc is the definitive evidence that the plasma is recombining ( overionized ) . as a possible origin of the overionization </S>",
    "<S> , an interaction between the ejecta and dense circumstellar matter is proposed ; the highly ionized gas was made at the initial phase of the snr evolution in dense regions , and subsequent rapid adiabatic expansion caused sudden cooling of the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis on the full x - ray band spectrum of ic  443 , which is newly presented in this paper , provides a consistent picture with this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we also comment on the implications from the fact that all the snrs having recombining plasmas are correlated with the mixed - morphology class .    </S>",
