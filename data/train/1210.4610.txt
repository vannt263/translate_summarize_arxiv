    "because the charm quark mass is finite , the total charm production cross section can be calculated in perturbative qcd",
    ". however , the charm quark mass is relatively light so that there are large uncertainties due to the choice of quark mass , factorization scale and renormalization scale @xcite . typical lower limits of the factorization and renormalization scales are half the chosen charm quark mass @xcite . here , the parton densities are subject to backward evolution since the factorization scale is below the minimum scale of the parton densities . in addition , for renormalization scales below 1 gev , the strong coupling constant @xmath1 becomes large and the perturbative expansion is unlikely to converge .",
    "thus is it worth evaluating our assumptions concerning these parameters to determine whether we can find a set of physically defensible mass and scale parameters that reduce the cross section uncertainty .    in the color evaporation model of @xmath0 production ,",
    "the @xmath0 cross sections are calculated with the same set of mass and scale parameters as open charm production @xcite . as we will show , the parameters used to calculate the uncertainty on the charm quark cross sections in refs .",
    "@xcite do not place stringent bounds on the @xmath0 production cross section .",
    "we therefore seek to place limits on the @xmath0 cross section calculated in the color evaporation model for the first time .",
    "in this paper we will explore the charm quark mass and scale parameter space to reduce the uncertainty on the charm total cross section . in sec .",
    "[ open ] , we use existing data to set limits on the factorization and renormalization scales .",
    "we will then calculate the lepton distributions from heavy flavor decays with our parameter limits and compare to data from rhic and the lhc as a reality check .",
    "section  [ closed ] describes how we use our open charm results in color evaporation model calculations of @xmath0 production to determine the uncertainties on quarkonium production , both as a function of incident energy and as a function of the kinematic variables . in sec .",
    "[ end ] , we summarize our results .",
    "in our previous efforts to place uncertainties on the total charm cross section using the same fiducial parameter set as the fonll calculation , we found a wide uncertainty band that grew larger at high center of mass energies @xcite . at high energies ,",
    "the lower limit was determined by a factorization scale of half the central value of the charm quark mass , assumed to be 1.5 gev . in this region , the behavior of the gluon density at low momentum fraction , @xmath2 , when the parton densities are backwards evolved caused the cross section to grow unphysically slowly with energy .",
    "the upper limit of the uncertainty is obtained when the renormalization scale is equal to half the charm quark mass . here",
    "the two - loop evaluation of the strong coupling constant gives @xmath3 , too large for convergence of the perturbative expansion .",
    "here we will use the total charm cross section data to obtain a more physically motivated set of parameters for charm production .",
    "we calculate the total hadronic charm production cross section in a @xmath4 collision directly using the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) matrix elements @xcite for the total partonic cross section , @xmath5 , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the charm quark mass , @xmath8 is the factorization scale , @xmath9 is the renormalization scale , @xmath10 is the partonic center of mass energy , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the fractions of the parent proton s momenta carried by the colliding partons and @xmath13 are the proton parton densities . the nlo calculation remains the state of the art for the total cross section ; there is still no complete nnlo evaluation of the total cross section , especially at energies where @xmath14 .",
    "we use the central ct10 parton density set @xcite but will also show the variation in the cross section based on all 52 variants of the hessian uncertainty matrix .    since eq .",
    "( [ nlo ] ) is independent of the heavy quark kinematics , it is typical to take @xmath15 as the central value and vary the two scales independently within a ` fiducial ' region defined by @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 . in earlier work",
    ", we used the following seven sets : @xmath19 = \\{(1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , ( 0.5,0.5 ) , ( 1,0.5 ) , ( 2,1 ) , ( 0.5,1 ) , ( 1,2 ) } @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties from the mass variation and the combined scale variations listed above were then added in quadrature .",
    "the envelope containing the resulting curves , @xmath20 defines the uncertainty on the total cross section as a function of center of mass energy . here",
    "@xmath21 is the cross section calculated with the central set , @xmath22 and @xmath23 gev , while @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the maximum and minimum values of the cross section for a given mass ( @xmath26 or @xmath27 set in the fiducial region ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "although eqs .",
    "( [ sigmax ] ) and ( [ sigmin ] ) have been written for the total cross section , the corresponding maximum and minimum values of the differential distributions can be written similarly @xcite .",
    "the charm quark mass we employ in our calculations is the particle data group ( pdg ) value based on lattice determinations of the charm quark mass in the @xmath29 scheme at @xmath30 : @xmath31  gev @xcite .",
    "the fiducial @xmath32 parameter sets used in fonll calculations @xcite employ a higher charm quark mass , @xmath33  gev .",
    "none of these fiducial parameter sets give a particularly good fit to the total charm data .",
    "when @xmath34 flavors are used , as is proper for charm production , there is a wide uncertainty band on @xmath35 , especially at the center - of - mass energies appropriate for colliders , @xmath36  gev , primarily due to unconstrained gluon densities at low @xmath2 for @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the minimum scale of the parton densities .",
    "previous calculations with lower charm quark masses but higher scales @xcite agree better with data while avoiding backward evolution of the gluon density at low @xmath2 .",
    "this bias of lower masses with higher scales allows us to reduce the uncertainty in the charm production cross section .    in principle , fitting the data is somewhat problematic since we neglect unknown next - order uncertainties .",
    "this is particularly true for charm where the mass is relatively small and @xmath39 corrections could be large . indeed , approximate nnlo calculations show that , while the scale dependence is reduced , the @xmath40 factor between the approximate nnlo and the nlo results is similar to that between the nlo and lo calculations @xcite . since a full nnlo calculation is not yet available , we feel a fit that narrows the uncertainties at collider energies is useful , keeping in mind that a full nnlo calculation might yield a good fit to the data with higher masses and somewhat lower scales .    for a fixed charm quark mass",
    ", we fit the factorization and renormalization scale parameters to a subset of the total charm production data .",
    "we use part of the fixed - target data measured with incident protons at beam energies @xmath41 @xcite , 360 @xcite , 400 @xcite , 450 @xcite , 800 @xcite , and 920 gev @xcite . we do not include incident pion data in the analysis because there have been no new global analyses of the pion parton densities since 1999 @xcite and none of the past pion fits are compatible with modern proton parton densities . the lexan bubble chamber ( lebc )",
    "was used in the measurements of the na16 @xcite , na27 @xcite and e743 @xcite collaborations .",
    "lebc allowed direct observation of the charm production and decay vertices .",
    "the first two measurements were made at cern @xcite while the last was made at fermilab @xcite .",
    "the 800 gev e653 measurement at fermilab used an emulsion target to measure the primary production vertex and at least one decay vertex contained within the emulsion volume @xcite . while none of these experiments had very high statistics ,",
    "their results were very clean .",
    "the e769 collaboration used silicon vertex detectors to reconstruct @xmath42 meson ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) decays @xcite .",
    "the na50 data at @xmath46 gev were obtained by studying the lepton pair invariant mass continuum over a range of nuclear targets .",
    "the continuum was assumed to be a superposition of dimuons from the drell - yan process and semileptonic decays of open charm .",
    "since the @xmath47 dependence of open charm and drell - yan production is compatible with a linear growth , @xmath48 , the charm cross section was obtained from a global fit to the four targets studied ( al , cu , ag and w ) @xcite .",
    "the data from refs .",
    "@xcite were evaluated in the review of loureno and whri and adjusted to the values we employ in our fits using the most up - to - date branching ratios for the measured decay channels @xcite .",
    "we also include total cross section data at @xmath49 gev from rhic .",
    "there are data from both phenix @xcite and star @xcite .",
    "the phenix measurement is based on inclusive single electron @xmath50 distributions in @xmath4 collisions in the pseudorapidity interval @xmath51 .",
    "the ` non - photonic ' electrons , assumed to come from heavy flavor decays , were extracted from the total electron spectrum by subtracting ` photonic ' ( background ) sources .",
    "the shape of the resulting @xmath50 distribution is described by a superposition of charm and bottom contributions .",
    "the charm contribution was extrapolated to @xmath52 to obtain the total charm cross section , @xmath53 mb @xcite .",
    "the first star data point was extracted from d+au collisions by two independent measurements @xcite .",
    "they directly reconstructed @xmath54 decays with @xmath55 and @xmath56 gev .",
    "star also used inclusive non - photonic electrons to study semileptonic decays of charm .",
    "the initial result , @xmath57 mb @xcite , was significantly higher than the phenix result but compatible within systematic uncertainties .",
    "after a reanalysis of the non - photonic electron data and new @xmath42 meson measurements , the star cross section reported at quark matter 2011 came down to @xmath58 mb @xcite while the final result , obtained after our analysis was finished , is reduced to @xmath59 mb @xcite .",
    "this does not change the central value of the scale parameters , only reduces the one standard deviation limits .",
    "while the final star result is still higher than the phenix cross section , the two results are now comparable within uncertainties .    we have made five different fits to combinations of the data just described : the fixed - target data @xcite only ; adding only the phenix data @xcite ; adding the phenix and the 2004 star result @xcite ; and finally , including the 2011 star result @xcite and , subsequently , checking how much the results changed when the final 2012 star point @xcite was added to the phenix data .",
    "the experimental uncertainties used in the fitting were obtained by adding the statistical and systematic uncertainties in quadrature .    in our analysis ,",
    "the total charm cross sections were calculated for a range of charm quark masses between 1.18 and 1.54  gev in steps of 0.03  gev . at each mass",
    ", we varied @xmath60 between 0.45 and 10.65 while simultaneously varying @xmath61 between 0.5 and 2.9 .",
    "the step size in @xmath60 and @xmath61 was 0.05 in both cases .",
    "the @xmath62/dof for each parameter set was evaluated by comparing the calculated cross sections with each of the five subsets of the data considered .",
    "the best fit values of @xmath60 and @xmath61 are rather sensitive to the charm mass . in general increasing the quark mass above 1.27 gev decreases both @xmath60 and @xmath61",
    ". it also tends to increase the @xmath63/dof for each fit .",
    "if one plots @xmath63/dof for a given value of @xmath7 as a function of either @xmath60 or @xmath61 while the other scale parameter is held fixed , typical parabolic shapes with a minimum are found .",
    "the parabolas grow narrower as the mass increases .",
    "when @xmath64 gev , single variable parabolas of @xmath63/dof are rather broad and prefer high @xmath16 values .",
    "for @xmath65 gev , the fits give @xmath66 , close to the minimum @xmath8 of the parton densities and in a region where @xmath67 is rather large .    because the charm quark mass was assigned the value of @xmath68  gev by the pdg , we decided to add a penalty to the @xmath62 equal to @xmath69 .",
    "with this penalty for deviations from the pdg value of the charm quark mass , the minimum @xmath62/dof when varying the charm quark mass within our chosen range was found for @xmath70  gev , the pdg mass , for all five subsets of the data .",
    "the best fit results in all cases are given in table  [ chi2table ] .",
    "the @xmath63/dof for each fit is also shown .",
    "the largest @xmath63/dof is obtained when the 2004 star point is used since it is high relative to the @xmath10 dependence of the other measurements .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath60 found with the later star results is more in line with physical arguments than that obtained with the 2004 data .",
    ".the factorization , @xmath60 , and renormalization , @xmath61 , scale uncertainties obtained by fitting subsets of the total charm cross section data with @xmath70 gev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the alice 7 tev @xmath50 distributions , shown in fig .",
    "[ psialicedistfig](b ) and ( c ) , include the alice rapidity cuts for the central and forward rapidity regions , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "the rapidity distribution at @xmath73 tev , fig .",
    "[ psialicedistfig](a ) , is flat over several units of rapidity . thus the integrated cross sections in the two rapidity intervals , normalized per unit of rapidity ,",
    "are very similar . however , the forward rapidity @xmath50 distribution is still a stronger function of @xmath50 than the midrapidity distribution .    finally , the inclusive @xmath0 rapidity distribution and forward rapidity @xmath50 distribution at @xmath74 tev are compared to the alice data in fig .",
    "[ psialice276distfig ] . here",
    "the calculated rapidity distribution is not as broad and the agreement with the data is rather good although the midrapidity point remains high relative to the central value of the calculation .",
    "the agreement of the calculated @xmath50 distribution with the forward rapidity data is quite good with the exception of the lowest @xmath50 point where the calculated distribution turns over more quickly than the data .",
    "we have narrowed the uncertainty band on the open heavy flavor cross section and , in so doing , have also provided a realistic uncertainty band on @xmath0 production in the color evaporation model . the central result , @xmath70 gev , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , is quite compatible with previous calculations using a ` by - eye ' fit to the data with @xmath77 gev , @xmath78 @xcite .    while the fits have been made by comparing the calculated nlo charm production cross section to available data at fixed - target energies and at rhic , they are in good agreement with the extracted total charm cross sections at the lhc .",
    "the same parameter set also provides good agreement with the distributions of single leptons from semileptonic heavy flavor decays at rhic and the lhc .",
    "the limit on the width of the uncertainty band is now set by the uncertainty due to bottom quark production and decay .",
    "we have used the same fit parameters in the calculation of @xmath0 production in the color evaporation model and have thus provided the first uncertainty band on @xmath0 production in this approach .",
    "the energy dependence of the total @xmath0 cross section that results is a good match to the data up to collider energies .",
    "the @xmath50 distributions are also in good agreement with the data from rhic and the lhc . in future work",
    ", we will use our new parameter set to place limits on the contribution of @xmath79 meson decays to @xmath0 production and will also study cold nuclear matter effects on @xmath0 production .",
