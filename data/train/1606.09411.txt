    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite is a phenomenon in which a strong control laser is used to modify the properties of a medium for a weak probe laser .",
    "the phenomenon uses the fact that most optical media are composed of multilevel atoms , so that the control and probe beams can act on different transitions .",
    "applications of eit include slowing of light @xcite",
    "( for use in quantum - information processing ) , lasing without inversion @xcite , enhanced nonlinear optics @xcite , high - resolution spectroscopy @xcite , and getting subnatural linewidth for tight locking of lasers to optical transitions @xcite .",
    "eit occurs due to two effects caused by the strong control laser ",
    "( i ) ac stark shift of the atomic levels leading to the creation of new eigenstates of the coupled atom plus photon system called _ dressed states _ ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ; but with the interaction hamiltonian included as described in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and ( ii ) the interference between the decay pathways to or from these dressed states . the dressed - state approach is better because it is valid at all intensities ( page 98 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , whereas the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite is valid only at high intensities .",
    "the degree of interference depends on the linewidth of the dressed states , and the role of this interference in eit is not well studied in all three - level systems .    in this work",
    ", we study in detail the dressed - state linewidth and interference in the three canonical types of three - level atoms  lambda ( @xmath0 ) , ladder ( @xmath1 ) , and vee ( v ) . for specificity , we choose hyperfine energy levels of @xmath2rb .",
    "this allows us to use realistic values of the decay rates , which is important since it influences the degree of interference in @xmath1 and v systems that involve multiple excited states .",
    "we find that the dressed - state linewidth steadily increases over these three systems .",
    "in addition , interference causes probe absorption to vanish identically at line center in @xmath0 systems because of the formation of a dark state .",
    "as expected , _ the effect of interference decreases with increasing rabi frequency of the control laser , since it causes increasing separation of the dressed states_.",
    "we define the three atomic levels as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "the probe laser drives the @xmath6 transition with rabi frequency @xmath7 and detuning @xmath8 .",
    "the strong control laser drives the @xmath9 transition with rabi frequency @xmath10 and detuning @xmath11 .",
    "both these transitions are electric dipole ( e1 ) allowed , and the levels involved have opposite parity .",
    "therefore , the @xmath12 transition involves levels of the same parity and is e1 forbidden .",
    "the level @xmath13 is assumed to have a spontaneous decay rate of @xmath14 . since ground levels have zero decay rate , depending on the particular three - level system , one or more of the @xmath14 s will be zero .",
    "the 3 three - level systems are shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "theoretical analysis for each system is done using a standard density matrix analysis of the three levels involved .",
    "time evolution of the elements is given by the general equation : @xmath15 - \\dfrac{1}{2}\\{\\gamma,\\rho\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the hamiltonian governing the atom - photon interaction , and @xmath17 is the relaxation rate .",
    "the coherence induced on the probe transition is given by the element @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , probe absorption is proportional to its imaginary part , while probe dispersion is proportional to its real part . in the following",
    ", we will operate in the weak - probe limit , i.e.  @xmath19 .",
    "the dressed states created by the control laser are shifted in energy by the ac stark shift .",
    "therefore they are located at values of @xmath20 given by : @xmath21 if we consider the special case of @xmath22 , i.e.  control laser on resonance , then probe absorption splits into the expected autler - townes doublet with peaks located at @xmath23 . since the control laser couples levels @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the linewidth of each dressed state is given by : @xmath26",
    "the probe laser couples levels @xmath27 and @xmath24 , hence the linewidth of each sub - peak in the probe absorption spectrum is : @xmath28 in the following , the above expression will be used to determine the linewidth of the autler - townes doublet in the 3 three - level systems .",
    "we first consider the @xmath0 system shown in fig .",
