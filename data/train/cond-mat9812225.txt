    "scattering of waves by complex systems has captured the interest of physicists for a long time .",
    "for instance , the problem of multiple scattering of waves has been of great importance in optics @xcite .",
    "interest in this problem has been revived recently , both for electromagnetic waves @xcite and for electrons @xcite , in relation with the phenomenon of localization , which gives rise to a great many fascinating effects .",
    "nuclear physics , with typical dimensions of a few _ f_m ( 1_f_m @xmath1 m ) , offers excellent examples of quantum - mechanical scattering by `` complex '' many - body systems dating as far back as the 1930 s when compound - nucleus resonances were discovered @xcite .",
    "the treatment in these cases is often frankly statistical because the details of the many - body problem are intractably complicated .    in the last two decades ,",
    "electron transport in disordered metals has been intensively investigated @xcite , as has transmission of electromagnetic waves through disordered media @xcite .",
    "the typical size scale is @xmath2 m for electronic systems and @xmath2 m to @xmath3 m in the electromagnetic case . because these are also examples of scattering in complex environments , where the character of the disorder is not exactly known , a statistical approach which treats an ensemble of disordered potentials is natural .",
    "amazingly , features similar to those of these complex nuclear and disordered problems have also been found in certain `` simple '' systems . while the geometry of these systems is apparently very simple quantum - mechanical scattering of just one particle by three circular disks in a plane , for instance the classical dynamics is fully chaotic .",
    "such systems have been studied by the `` quantum chaos '' community , in which the main question is how the nature of the classical dynamics influences the quantum properties @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the complex cases , these systems are amenable to exact ( numerical ) calculation ; when the results are analyzed statistically , however , the results are closely related to those of the complex systems @xcite .",
    "experimentally , two types of simple scattering systems have been studied in particular : electron transport through microstructures called `` ballistic quantum dots '' , whose dimensions are of the order of 1@xmath4 m , and microwave scattering from metallic cavities , with typical dimensions of @xmath3 m .",
    "the `` universal '' statistical properties of wave - interference phenomena observed in systems whose dimensions span about 14 orders of magnitude turn out to depend on very general physical principles and constitute the central topic of this article . although our main interest throughout the paper is electronic transport through ballistic chaotic cavities , or ballistic quantum dots , described in section [ mesoscopics ] , we wish to emphasize the generality of the ideas involved , presenting first in section [ nuclear physics ] their application in the field of nuclear physics where some of them were first introduced with a brief reference to microwave cavities at the end of that subsection .",
    "one of the most successful models in nuclear physics , called the optical model of the nucleus , was invented by feshbach , porter and weisskopf in the 1950 s @xcite .",
    "that model , which works very nicely over a wide range of energies , describes the scattering of a nucleon by an atomic nucleus a complicated many - body problem in terms of two distinct time scales :    \\1 .",
    "prompt _ response arising from _ direct processes _ , in which the incident nucleon feels a mean field produced by the other nucleons .",
    "this response is described mathematically in terms of the _ average _ of the actual scattering amplitudes over an energy interval : these averaged amplitudes , also known as _",
    "optical _ amplitudes , show a much slower energy variation than the original ones .    \\2 .",
    "a _ delayed _ , or",
    "_ equilibrated _ , response , corresponding to the formation and decay of the compound nucleus .",
    "it is described by the difference between the exact and the optical scattering amplitudes : it varies appreciably with energy and is studied with _",
    "statistical _ concepts using techniques known as random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "just as in the field of statistical mechanics time averages are very difficult to construct and hence are replaced by _ ensemble averages _ using the notion of _ ergodicity _ , in the present context too one finds it advantageous to study energy averages in terms of ensemble averages through an ergodic property @xcite .",
    "the optical model not only works well in nuclear physics , but has also been applied successfully in the description of a number of chemical reactions , thus bringing us from the nuclear to the molecular size scale @xcite .",
    "the connection of the above problems with the theory of waveguides and cavities was proposed very clearly by ericson and mayer - kuckuk more than thirty years ago @xcite : `` nuclear - reaction theory is equivalent to the theory of waveguides ... we will concentrate on processes in which the incident wave goes through a highly complicated motion in the nucleus ... we will picture the nucleus as a closed cavity , with reflecting but highly irregular walls . ''",
    "in fact , recent experiments with microwave cavities have shown features similar to those that had been observed in the nuclear case .",
    "importantly , the `` irregular walls '' anticipated from the nuclear case are _ not _ necessary in order to see these features : the analogy between nuclear reaction theory and the theory of waveguides holds for simple smooth cavities as long as the corresponding classical dynamics is chaotic @xcite .",
    "this has been the focus of several recent experiments involving microwave scattering from metallic cavities @xcite .",
    "these studies in simple chaotic systems were predated by extensive studies on scattering of microwaves by a disordered dielectric medium ; particularly important are the experiments of a. genack and collaborators @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the use of statistical concepts to analyze electromagnetic scattering by waveguides started quite independently of the connection to the complex scattering of nuclear physics , in the context of radio wave propagation @xcite .",
    "the term _ mesoscopic _ system refers to microstructures in which the phase of the single - electron wave function in an independent - electron approximation remains coherent across the system of interest @xcite : this means that the phase - coherence length @xmath5 associated with processes that can change the environment the other electrons , or the phonon field to an orthogonal state exceeds the system size @xcite .",
    "this is realized in the laboratory with systems whose spatial dimensions are on the order of 1@xmath4 m or less and at temperatures @xmath61 k. in so - called _ ballistic cavities _ , or _",
    "quantum dots _ , the electron motion is in addition practically ballistic , except for specular reflection from the walls : thus the elastic mean free path @xmath7 also exceeds the system size . in the most favorable material system ,",
    "gaas heterostructures , this condition can also be realized for cavities of size @xmath8 m @xcite .",
    "experimentally , an electrical current is established through the leads that connect the cavity to the outside and the potential difference across the cavity is measured , from which the conductance @xmath9 is extracted . in an independent - electron picture one thus aims at understanding the quantum - mechanical single - electron scattering by the cavity , while the leads play the role of waveguides .",
    "it is the multiple scattering of the waves reflected by the various portions of the cavity that gives rise to interference effects .",
    "three important experimental probes of the interference effects are an external magnetic field @xmath10 , the fermi energy @xmath11 , and the shape of the cavity : when these are varied the relative phase of the various partial waves changes and so the interference pattern changes .",
    "the changing interference pattern in turn causes the conductance to change ; this sensitivity of @xmath9 to small changes in parameters through quantum interference is called _",
    "conductance fluctuations_.    the connection between scattering by simple chaotic cavities @xcite and mesoscopic systems was first made theoretically @xcite .",
    "subsequently , cavities in the shape of a stadium , for which the single - electron classical dynamics would be chaotic , were first reported in ref . @xcite .",
    "more recently , several other types of structures have been investigated including experimental _",
    "ensembles _ of shapes @xcite .",
    "averages of the conductance , its fluctuations , and its full distribution were obtained over such an ensemble .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to provide a theoretical framework to describe this physical situation . to this end",
    "we will set up a scheme similar to that explained in section [ nuclear physics ] in connection with the scattering problem in nuclear physics . a complementary treatment based on semiclassical ideas has also been developed but will not be covered here @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by presenting the general ideas of quantum - mechanical scattering by a cavity , introducing the scattering or @xmath0 matrix of the problem ( sec .",
    "[ scatt ] ) , and then turn to treating an ensemble of systems in terms of an ensemble of @xmath0 matrices ( sec .",
    "[ ensembles ] ) .",
    "specific analytical results for the conductance are then presented , first in the absence of direct processes ( sec .",
    "[ no direct processes ] ) , and then with direct processes present ( sec .",
    "[ direct processes ] ) .",
    "we then compare our theoretical results with the numerical solution of the schrdinger equation ( sec .",
    "[ numerics ] ) , and finally in sec .",
    "[ dephasing ] compare with the experimental data that were already mentioned above . in the latter comparisons ,",
    "a number of discrepancies are found ; to reconcile theory and experiment , we realize the necessity of introducing the effect of processes that destroy the coherence of the wave function in the sample .",
    "finally , the conclusions of our work are presented in sec .",
    "[ conclusion ] . some of the main results in this paper have appeared in condensed form in our previous publications @xcite .",
    "consider a system of noninteracting electrons .",
    "since we shall be dealing with cases in which spin - orbit coupling is negligible , we disregard the spin degree of freedom and just consider `` spinless electrons '' in what follows .",

    "[ cavity ] .",
    "the microstructure consists of a cavity , connected to the outside by @xmath13 leads , ideally of infinite length , that play the role of waveguides .",

    "<S> we develop a statistical theory describing quantum - mechanical scattering of a particle by a cavity when the geometry is such that the classical dynamics is chaotic . </S>",
    "<S> this picture is relevant to a variety of physical systems , ranging from atomic nuclei to mesoscopic systems to microwave cavities ; the main application here is to electronic transport through ballistic microstructures . </S>",
    "<S> the theory describes the regime in which there are two distinct time scales , associated with a prompt and an equilibrated response , and is cast in terms of the matrix of scattering amplitudes @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the prompt response is related to the energy average of @xmath0 which , through the notion of ergodicity , is expressed as the average over an ensemble of similar systems . </S>",
    "<S> we use an information - theoretic approach : the ensemble of @xmath0-matrices is determined by ( 1 ) general physical features symmetry , causality , and ergodicity , ( 2 ) the specific energy average of @xmath0 , and ( 3 ) the notion of minimum information in the ensemble . </S>",
    "<S> this ensemble , known as poisson s kernel , is meant to describe those situations in which any other information is irrelevant . </S>",
    "<S> thus , one constructs the one - energy statistical distribution of @xmath0 using only information expressible in terms of @xmath0 itself without ever invoking the underlying hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> this formulation has a remarkable predictive power : from the distribution of @xmath0 we derive properties of the quantum conductance of cavities , including its average , its fluctuations , and its full distribution in certain cases , both in the absence and presence prompt response . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain good agreement with the results of the numerical solution of the schrdinger equation for cavities in which the assumptions of the theory hold : ones in which either prompt response is absent or there are two widely separated time scales . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement with experimental data is obtained once temperature smearing and dephasing effects are taken into account . </S>"
