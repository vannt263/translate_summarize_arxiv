    "<S> we show that the s=1/2 pyrochlore lattice with both heisenberg and antisymmetric , dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) interactions , can order antiferromagnetically into a state with chiral symmetry , dictated by the distribution of the dm interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral antiferromagnetic state is characterized by a small staggered magnetic moment induced by the dm interaction . </S>",
    "<S> an external magnetic field can also lead to characteristic field - induced ordering patterns , strongly dependent on the field direction , and generally separated by a quantum phase transition from the chiral ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram at finite temperature is also discussed . </S>"
