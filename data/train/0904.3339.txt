    "the subdivision algebra @xmath18 is a type @xmath15 generalization of @xmath29 and its intimate connection to type @xmath15 root polytopes is displayed by a variety of results obtained by using this connection .",
    "root polytopes were first defined by postnikov in @xcite , although the full root polytope of type @xmath30 already appeared in the work of gelfand , graev and postnikov @xcite , where they gave a canonical triangulation of it into simplices corresponding to noncrossing alternating trees .",
