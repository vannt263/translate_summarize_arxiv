    "[ [ a .- gr1-as - a - satisfiability - problem ] ] a. gr1 as a satisfiability problem + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this appendix we show how a realization of gr1 can be formulated as a satisfiability problem ( sat )  @xcite , an optimization problem where @xmath0 boolean variables are constrained by @xmath77 conjunctive normal form ( cnf ) constraints ( i.e. by a boolean polynomial constructed as a product ( @xmath78 ) of @xmath77 disjunctive monomials ( @xmath79 ) ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) is equivalent to the xor boolean constraint @xmath80 .",
    "this can be recast in cnf , as @xmath81 clauses involving @xmath82 variables .",
    "each clause corresponds with a simple map to each line @xmath83 ( including the output ) in the truth table of @xmath84 .",
    "namely , if the value of variable @xmath85 is @xmath86 in the truth table line , it will be negated in the cnf clause .",
    "viceversa , it will be affirmed if its value is @xmath87 .",
    "the formula @xmath88 , defines a satisfiability problem on the variables @xmath89 , with @xmath90 .",
    "a realization of gr1 differs from a sat problem for the intrinsically asymmetric form of the constraints , which `` force '' the value of @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , considering random instances of the problem , the space of allowed functions of gr1 is much smaller than the corresponding sat problem .",
    "for example , for a clause with fixed connectivity @xmath53 , while there are @xmath92 possible boolean functions , all of which can appear in sat , only @xmath93 of these can appear in gr1 .",
    "the two above features make the leaf removal technique useful for the latter model .      in this appendix",
    ", we discuss the average of @xmath29 on the realizations of the constraints @xmath94 , for @xmath35-gr1 .",
    "one can write @xmath95 here , the randomness is contained : ( i ) in the specification of the network structure , @xmath96 , i.e. in the coordinates @xmath13 ; ( ii ) in the specification of the functions @xmath97 within the class @xmath98 of all boolean functions .",
    "an overbar ( @xmath99 ) indicates an average on both distributions , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . taking for @xmath98 the class of all boolean functions , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath102 , independently from the specification of the network structure .",
    "this result remains true considering a sub - family @xmath103 of functions that satisfy @xmath104 .",
    "the reason for this is that one finds @xmath105 .",
    "we should note that the conventional average of @xmath29 might be biased by the weight of exceptions  @xcite . to access the typical behavior of the system ,",
    "the correct quantity to compute is the `` quenched average '' , @xmath106 , usually accessed with the replica , or similar methods  @xcite . in the case under exam we have computed the _ annealed _ average @xmath107 ( in general @xmath108 ) . for k - gr1 with",
    "poisson distributed out - degree , we have shown the presence of a self - averaging property for @xmath29 . that is , the quantity @xmath109^{2 } } - \\left[\\overline{\\mathcal{n}}\\right]^2 ) /    ( \\left[\\overline{\\mathcal{n}}\\right]^2 )   $ ] vanishes in the thermodynamic limit @xmath110 so that , in the simple and complex control regimes , an equality holds between quenched and annealed average  @xcite ."

    "<S> the regulatory machinery is embodied by the transcription factors , proteins that bind to special sites along dna and control the activity of rna polymerase  @xcite ( fig .  </S>",

    "<S> each diamond node represents a constraint , while each black circle is a variable . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we approach this problem with a model based on two features . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , it focuses , rather than on dynamics , on the compatibility between gene expression patterns and signal integration functions . </S>",
    "<S> simply put , a cell with @xmath0 genes can express them in exponentially many ways , @xmath3 in the boolean representation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the cell never explores all the patterns of expression . </S>",
    "<S> it only knows clusters of correlated configurations . </S>",
    "<S> an elementary example is the ci - cro switch of @xmath4-phage  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> looking at the system , one could observe the states 10 , 01 or perhaps 00 , but not 11 . </S>",
    "<S> one can think that in larger systems many configurations are ruled out for the same compatibility reasons . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the model takes explicitly into account that some genes are essentially `` free '' from the point of view of transcription ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : foglia ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this fact is evident looking at the available data  @xcite . while the biological situation is more complex , we regard these genes as input receptors , connected to external stimuli . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest formulation ( gr1 , from gene - regulation ) assumes boolean variables and functions . </S>",
    "<S> we use it to investigate theoretically the control exerted by the free genes on the expression patterns for large @xmath0 , and for random realizations of the constraints  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the satisfying configurations leads to the introduction of a `` core '' of network variables . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the number of free genes in the core and the connectivity of the constraints , there are three distinct regimes of gene control . in the first regime , </S>",
    "<S> the core is empty . </S>",
    "<S> each free gene controls the state of a small number of genes ( `` simple control '' phase ) . in the second regime </S>",
    "<S> ( `` complex control '' ) , the core contains free genes that control , both directly and indirectly , order @xmath0 others . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the complex control phase , the free core genes can be interpreted as the subset of genes that determine a choice of an expression program . in the third regime , there are no free genes in the core , and the system can not control the simultaneous expression of all its genes . the transition can be tuned by varying the connectivity and the number of constraints .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ model . ] ] model . </S>",
    "<S> + + + + + +    the two main ingredients of our representation of a transcription network are : ( i ) a set of @xmath0 discrete variables @xmath5 associated to genes or operons ( identified with their transcripts and protein products ) . </S>",
    "<S> these variables represent the expression levels . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) a set of @xmath1 interactions , representing the signal integration , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> it is useful to represent variables and interactions in a so - called factor graph , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fagraph ] . </S>",
    "<S> note that the constraints @xmath8 contain the topology of the graph . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath9 represent real or coarse - grained expression levels and can take values in @xmath10 or even continuous ones . in general , using the shea and ackers model of gene activation by recruitment  @xcite , one can construct a local free energy associated to each signal integration node , that generates the constraints  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider the simplest possible scenario , gr1 , treating the expression levels as boolean variables ( i.e. setting @xmath11 ) , and the signal integration functions as boolean functions @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the coordinates @xmath13 point at the variable occupying place @xmath14 in the @xmath15th constraint . </S>",
    "<S> the expression @xmath16 imposes that the variable @xmath17 is the output of the function @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , let us consider a graph with three variables and one constraint , labeled by @xmath19 . supposing the first two variables regulate the third , @xmath20 , @xmath21 . if , for instance , the transcription can occur only when both regulators are present , then @xmath22 only if @xmath23 ( boolean and function ) . </S>",
    "<S> the local connectivity of a function node is @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 is called the `` in - degree '' . </S>",
    "<S> the factor graph is also associated to an `` out - degree '' @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the number of functions connected to @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that variables and constraints are boolean make gr1 an optimization problem of the satisfiability type ( sat )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a very special one , given the structure of the signal integration functions . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of the model depend on the class of graphs and boolean functions used . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented in this work hold for a rather large class of boolean functions ( see appendix a ) .    [ [ structure - of - the - solution - space . ] ] structure of the solution space . </S>",
    "<S> + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the phase - space structure has never been explored for this particular case . </S>",
    "<S> we set out to analyze the number of compatible configurations @xmath29 , for large @xmath0 and @xmath1 and random instances of the problem . to this end , consider the following argument , which focuses on the control exerted by the @xmath30 `` free '' input genes on the compatible solutions . </S>",
    "<S> together with the free genes , the network contains some genes which are regulated but do not regulate any other </S>",
    "<S> . we can refer to them as `` leaves '' ( fig  [ fig : foglia ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> given a realization , a leaf can always be adjusted to the output value of its function , which is then satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> let us now remove from the graph each leaf and iterate this procedure ( a variation of the so - called `` leaf removal '' algorithm  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are two possible outcomes : either erasing all the graph , leaving the free genes as isolated points , or stopping at a core of constraints that contains loops . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the algorithm identifies the tree - like components of the graph connected to outputs . </S>",
    "<S> the core will be composed of @xmath31 genes and @xmath32 constraints . </S>",
    "<S> let us now imagine to have a compatible configuration , flip a free gene , and try to construct another compatible configuration . </S>",
    "<S> in the case where the core is empty , since the graph is tree - like , it will always be possible to perform this operation by local rearrangements , which propagate the output of the functions . </S>",
    "<S> thus , flipping all the free genes , we find @xmath33 satisfying configurations . in the presence of a core , because of the loops , flipping a free gene of the core will in general rearrange all the core genes , and is not guaranteed to lead to a new satisfying state . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , it is not granted there will be a compatible state to start with . </S>",
    "<S> provided there is , the output propagation procedure can be applied to the non - core free genes to construct another .        </S>",
    "<S> thus , in general the @xmath30 degrees of freedom given by the free genes can not guarantee a solution . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant parameter is the number of core free genes @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> let us for the moment restrict to the case of fixed in - degree ( `` @xmath35-gr1 '' ) . in appendix b </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the average of @xmath29 on the class of all boolean functions is @xmath33 . thus : ( a ) if the core is empty , the number of compatible configurations constructed by flipping the free genes are on average all the possible ones . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) if the core is not empty , in the average case it will still be possible to construct @xmath33 solutions by flipping the free genes . if @xmath36 , there will be @xmath37 clusters of solutions , and ( c ) in the case where the core contains no free genes there will be generally contradictions . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus distiguish the three regimes : ( a ) simple control , ( b ) complex control , ( c ) no control . considering ensembles of random graphs </S>",
    "<S> , the regimes above depend on the value of @xmath38 , so that a proper order parameter to adopt is @xmath39  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram can be explored studying the rank and the kernel of the connectivity matrix in the ensemble .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ example - the - case - of - poisson - distributed - c_i . ] </S>",
    "<S> ] example : the case of poisson - distributed @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    this is the simplest ensemble to consider , where @xmath40  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this probability distribution does nt exclude that genes may appear in the functions that regulate them , leaving some freedom of choice . in the simplest case </S>",
    "<S> , one finds @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is defined by the relation @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the phase diagram as a function of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath46 there is simple control . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath47 complex control , and for @xmath48 no control . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for @xmath49-gr1 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the regimes of gene control correspond to thermodynamic phases , commonly referred to as sat , hard - sat , and unsat phase respectively  @xcite .     as a function of @xmath45 for different values of @xmath52 in the multi - poisson case . </S>",
    "<S> the discrete jumps are due to the onset of complex control phases for the different values of @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 can become negative many times , giving rise to reentrant no control phases ( inset ) . </S>",
    "<S> the figure refers to a connectivity distribution with a cutoff at @xmath55 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is possible to show rigorously the clustering of solutions argued above . in the simple control phase </S>",
    "<S> , one cluster contains all the solutions , and a free gene controls @xmath56 other genes . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is that , for poisson distributed out - degree , the average number of controlled genes is finite @xmath57 , while the number of free genes is extensive . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , in the complex control phase , the free genes within the core control @xmath58 other genes ( while there is still @xmath56 control outside of the core ) . from a physical point of view </S>",
    "<S> , the clusters are separated by an extensive distance , i.e. by free energy barriers . </S>",
    "<S> the number of clusters is related to the ( computational ) complexity @xmath59 of the system , defined by the relation @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath61 , the entropy , measures the width of each cluster , while @xmath59 `` counts '' the number of clusters . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by definition , @xmath59 is directly related to @xmath62 , i.e. to the partitioning of the free genes in and out of the core . how the system explores ( or not ) these clusters depends on details of its dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> generically , one can say that the dynamics in a cluster will be residual : many variables are fixed , the others can change . this matches a qualitative feature of many cells , where some genes are constantly expressed , and the rest vary  @xcite .    [ [ multi - poisson - phase - diagram . ] ] multi - poisson phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    while the fixed @xmath53 case is useful to get some theoretical insight , the known transcription networks are far from having fixed in - degree . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in e.  coli , the in - degree has poisson distribution , while the out - degree resembles a power law . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason , a biologically more interesting case is when both the in- and the out - degree vary along the network . </S>",
    "<S> considering @xmath63 , the conditioned probability that a variable is in @xmath64 clauses of the @xmath53 kind , we have @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the leaf removal equations can be applied separately to sets of clauses with a given connectivity , defining @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> choosing @xmath69 does not affect the exponential asymptotic decay of @xmath70 for large @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> we can call this case multi - poisson , as the graph is a superposition , following a poisson distribution , of graphs with fixed in - degree and poisson - distrubuted out - degree .     for the multi - poisson case . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line , a power law with exponent @xmath71 , represents the mean value of the numerically evaluated critical parameter @xmath72 for the simple - complex control transition of network realizations with @xmath73 . ]    the behavior of gr1 on such a topology is nontrivially different from the fixed connectivity case . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason for this is that , while @xmath74 is still locally decreasing , many new discontinuities emerge , due to the influence of clauses with different connectivities . </S>",
    "<S> this gives rise to different phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , @xmath62 can increase globally with increasing @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it does increase step - wise with @xmath45 after @xmath75 , to decrease again before @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> its discrete jumps are due to the onset of complex control phases for the different values of @xmath53 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mp - delta ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this fact has an influence on the number of compatible states as a function of @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , @xmath62 can become negative and then jump back to a positive value , creating a reentrant unsat phase ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mp - pd ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , on average , by increasing the number of constraints one can pass from unsolvable problems to solvable ones . a heuristic explanation for this counterintuitive fact is that , at fixed @xmath0 , the addition of a constraint might connect a closed loop in the core to external free genes , thereby solving a contradiction . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the simple to complex control boundary is a power - law in @xmath45 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mp - pd ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ discussion . ] ] discussion . </S>",
    "<S> + + + + + + + + + + +    to conclude , we established a simple framework for the modeling of large scale transcription networks . </S>",
    "<S> it is a compatibility analysis on the constraints established by transcription . </S>",
    "<S> its advantage is that , while avoiding to deal directly with the dynamics , it gives non - trivial results . in the absence of an explicit knowledge of the emergent time scales </S>",
    "<S> , we feel this is an appropriate approach , particularly in the boolean approximation treated here . from a technical standpoint </S>",
    "<S> , gr1 is different from other problems of the satisfiability kind because of the particular structure of its constraints . </S>",
    "<S> this makes it possible to apply the leaf removal technique , which is ineffective for other models , such as random - k - sat  @xcite . from a general standpoint </S>",
    "<S> , our model shows that the `` biological '' complexity is not simply measured by the number of genes . </S>",
    "<S> a more proper indicator is @xmath62 which depends on the order parameter @xmath52 , or - roughly - on the number of transcription factors per gene . at fixed number of genes </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that this quantity increases in bacteria that need to react to more environments  @xcite . imagining that prokaryotes are naturally found in a simple control phase </S>",
    "<S> , our phase diagram predicts an intrinsic limit to this process , represented by the phase boundary with the complex control phase . </S>",
    "<S> the multi - poisson case gives an interesting prediction for the behaviour of this boundary at fixed @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> namely , at criticality , the average number of constraints scales as a power - law with @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> this feature , together with the existence of a core and the predictions on the control exerted by free genes , can possibly be tested experimentally .    </S>",
    "<S> the approach presented here is new , and largely unexplored . </S>",
    "<S> it is naturally fit to study networks with non - boolean variables and probabilistic constraints . </S>",
    "<S> it can be of use for models that describe other regulation mechanisms than just transcription . </S>",
    "<S> more far - reached extensions include evolutionary models . </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear yet exactly how useful it can be for the study of concrete biological networks . together with the general trends , a biologically significant model has to be able to deal with the details of an individual realization the system </S>",
    "<S> this is , we think , the main challenge to our approach , and the direction we are currently exploring .    we would like to acknowledge interesting discussions with j.  berg , m.  caselle , l.  finzi , m.  leone , a.  sportiello , p.r .  </S>",
