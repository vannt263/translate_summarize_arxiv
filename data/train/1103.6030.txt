    "however , a fundamental  angular momentum problem \" arises , as galaxies are produced with a baryonic component that is quite deficient in angular momentum compared to real spirals @xcite . aside from artificial losses of angular momentum caused by insufficient resolution and other numerical effects",
    "@xcite , this failure has traditionally been traced back to the very nature of the hierarchical buildup of structures : dynamical friction transfers the orbital angular momentum of merging substructures to the outer halo , and causes the associated cold baryons to sink to the center of the proto - galaxy and form a spheroid rather than a disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "two recent exceptions are the simulations of @xcite and @xcite . in the first , replicas of sb / sc galaxies with moderate bulges were obtained with a low efficiency of star formation that may implicitly mimic the bottleneck of the conversion of atomic gas into molecular , at the expense of producing stellar disks that are much more massive than expected at a given halo mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "eris , by contrast , maintains a relatively low baryon fraction , between 64% and 73% of the cosmic value at all redshift @xmath167 .",
    "note that these values are higher than the value measured at the present epoch in the bulgeless dwarf galaxy simulation of @xcite , which is only 30% of the cosmic fraction . *",
    "while erislt was run with a star formation efficiency that was half of that adopted for eris , its stellar content at @xmath21 is 20% higher , showing that the most important parameter in the star formation recipe is not the efficiency but rather the star formation density threshold .",
    "indeed , by allowing the gas to reach higher densities before turning into stars , the ism develops a more inhomogeneous structure , with important consequences on the large - scale pattern of star formation in the galaxy , and , as a byproduct , on the effect of supernovae feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "+        * at @xmath21 , about 14% of the total gas content in erislt is in a cold phase , 19% is warm , and 67% is in a hot component .",
    "the same fractions are 30% , 18% , and 52% in eris , i.e. there is 2 times more cold gas in eris than in erislt .",
    "the difference in the density distribution and thermodynamic state of the ism in the two simulations is clearly seen in figure [ fig7 ] , which shows the local gas density versus radius of each gas particle at different epochs .",
    "the horizontal green line in each panel marks the adopted star formation threshold , and particles are color coded according to their temperature .",
    "stars are born only in the blue gas particles above the green lines .",
    "because of the increased threshold , fewer regions are forming stars at any given time in eris . according to equation ( [ eq : ks ] ) , however , within these cold dense clumps the number of massive stars per unit gas mass born at threshold scales as @xmath168 , i.e. it is a factor @xmath169 times larger in eris versus erislt .",
    "as these stars explode as sne , the energy injected at high redshift in eris s ism is enough to disrupt and unbind the star forming regions , generating strong outflows that leave the galaxy and reduce its baryonic content .",
    "* figure [ fig7 ] also shows that , at @xmath150 , star formation can only occur in eris inner densest regions within 10 kpc from the center .",
    "by contrast , in erislt , star formation is spread out over a significant fraction of the host galaxy , extending well beyond 20 kpc . at @xmath29 , when outflows are stronger due the high star formation rates triggered by mergers , it is the cold , low angular momentum gas at the center that is preferentially removed in eris , as previously found for dwarf galaxies by @xcite .",
    "such outflows are weaker in the low threshold simulation , where star formation is more diffuse and the energy injection from sne is more evenly deposited in the ism : cold gas accumulates in the inner regions already at very high redshifts and continues to turn into stars unabated by feedback ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "at lower redshift erislt has now consumed its low - angular momentum cold gas in star formation , while eris has preserved a higher cold gas fraction due to the more effective regulation of star formation via feedback . by @xmath21",
    "both galaxies have formed roughly the same amount of stars , but 90% of the gas within 20 kpc from the center is still cold in eris , compared to only 57% in erislt .",
    "the distributions of stellar angular momenta are also different in the two cases ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "gas being blown out at high redshift has a systematically lower angular momentum than the gas that gets accreted at later times @xcite , and this explains the flatter rotation curve of eris relative to erislt .",
    "it is fair to point out that , while the success of our eris simulation in matching the observations appears to be linked to the ability of correctly following star formation in an inhomogenous ism and regulating it with sn feedback , many avenues remain unexplored and require further investigation .",
    "simulations of even higher resolution , approaching the true gas densities reached in star forming giant molecular cloud complexes ( about a factor of 10 higher than adopted here ) , are needed to test the convergence and robustness of our results , and are in the making .",
    "the density threshold should depend on metallicity and therefore on redshift @xcite , which may affect the structure of the ism and sn feedback differently in progenitors at different epochs .",
    "the feedback model that we use is still phenomenological , and the actual mechanism of outflow generation may require the combination of more than one effect to support a large - scale blastwave ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "lastly , the simulations presented in this paper neglect cooling by metal lines at temperatures above @xmath170 k. at the mass scale considered here , cold flows are mostly responsible for the assembly of the star forming disk even at low redshift , as opposed to the cooling flow of the hot halo mode @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the details of the cooling function for gas above @xmath170 k , namely in the hot mode , are not important for the assembly of the disk .",
    "@xcite find that metal cooling gives origin to a stronger burst of star formation at high redshift in the progenitors of milky - way sized galaxies and thus to bigger bulges .",
    "this result , however , was obtained with the canonical low star formation density threshold ( @xmath7 atoms @xmath6 ) , and it is unclear in which temperature range the effect of metal cooling is most crucial .",
    "these authors also show that the augmented bulge can be suppressed by boosting the effect of ( thermal and kinetic ) sn feedback .",
    "it is conceivable that , by further increasing the density threshold for star formation toward actual giant molecular cloud densities , along with modeling the formation of molecular hydrogen , the ism may become increasingly clumpy and dense , populating the high surface density tail of the kennicutt - schmidt relation that remains currently unresolved in eris . as a result",
    ", one may expect that heating and outflows from even more localized sn feedback may become stronger in such high density regions , and eventually offset the impact of increased cooling , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "we plan to explore these issues in the next generation of simulations with increased resolution , a higher star formation density threshold , and the inclusion of molecular phase physics .",
    "in addition to the effect on disk and bulge , metal cooling at @xmath171 k may also have an impact on the density profile and temperature of the hot halo .",
    "@xcite find a significant reduction of the mass of the hot halo when metal cooling is included , under the assumption of a gas metallicity of @xmath172 .",
    "this is higher than the metallicity measured in spiral galaxies with extended x - ray and h@xmath173 emission around their disk , which is in the range @xmath174 @xcite , suggesting that the effect may have been overestimated .",
    "the mean metallicity of hot gas in eris closely matches the latter observations , being on average @xmath175 ( with @xmath176 , @xcite ) .",
    "the last major merger in our simulations occurs at @xmath177 , and therefore eris is expected to show some offset from the observed structural parameters of the average spiral galaxy .",
    "the same likely applies to the milky way itself , which indeed closely resembles eris . whether or not the good match with the properties of typical spiral galaxies is related to the fact that we have selected a particularly quiet merging history , in which outflows shut off early as the rate of star formation drops after the last major merger , will have to be investigated .    at @xmath178 , the evolution of the b / d ratio is non - monotonic and it is seen to decrease following a major merger at @xmath29 and a minor merger at @xmath21 , and to grow secularly at lower redshifts .",
    "the details of this evolution will be the subject of a forthcoming paper ( guedes et al .",
    "2011c , in preparation ) .",
    "more typical galaxies undergoing significant mergers at later times may develop smaller bulges due to the more prolonged effect of supernovae outflows , which could explain why 11 out of 19 nearby massive spirals show no evidence for a classical bulge @xcite ) .",
    "if true , the trend would be at odds with the standard picture in which mergers lead to earlier type objects .",
    "this would be an important new ingredient , perhaps complementary to the finding that gas - rich mergers assist the growth of larger disks @xcite .",
