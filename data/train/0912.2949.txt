    "one of the most important discoveries in the study of the chemical composition of stars was made in 1982 by m. and f. spite , who found an essentially constant li abundance in warm metal - poor stars ( spite & spite 1982 ) , a result interpreted as a relic of primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "due to its cosmological significance , there have been many studies devoted to li in metal - poor field stars ( e.g. melndez & ramrez 2004 ; boesgaard et al .",
    "2005 ; charbonnel & primas 2005 ; nissen et al .",
    "2005 ; asplund et al . 2006 ; bonifacio et al . 2007 ; shi et al . 2007 ; hosford et al .",
    "2009 ; aoki et al .",
    "2009 ) , with observed li abundances at the lowest [ fe / h ] from as low as @xmath3 = 1.94 to as high as @xmath3 = 2.37 .",
    "using the theory of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) and the baryon density obtained from wmap data , a primordial li abundance of @xmath3 = 2.72@xmath4 is predicted ( cyburt et al .",
    "2008 ) , which is a factor of 2 - 6 times higher than the li abundance inferred from halo stars .",
    "there have been many theoretical studies on non - standard bbn trying to explain the cosmological li discrepancy by exploring the frontiers of new physics ( e.g. coc et al .",
    "2009 ; jedamzik & pospelov 2009 ; kohri & santoso 2009 ) .",
    "alternatively , the li problem could be explained by a reduction of the original li stellar abundance due to internal processes ( i.e. , by stellar depletion ) .",
    "in particular , stellar models including atomic diffusion and mixing can deplete a significant fraction of the initial li content ( e.g. , richard et al .",
    "2005 ; korn et al . 2006 ; lind et al . 2009 ) .    due to the uncertainties in the li abundances and to the limited samples available , only limited comparisons of models of li depletion with stars in a broad range of mass and metallicities have been performed .",
    "we are performing such a study ( melndez et al .",
    "2010 ) , achieving errors in li abundance lower than 0.035 dex , for a large sample of metal - poor stars ( -3.5 @xmath0 [ fe / h ] @xmath0 -1.0 ) , for the first time with precisely determined t@xmath5 ( casagrande et al . 2010 ) and masses in a relatively broad mass range ( 0.6 - 0.9 m@xmath6 ) .",
    "our new temperature scale ( casagrande et al . 2010 ) is highly accurate , since it has been calibrated using solar twins ( melndez et al .",
    "2009 ; ramrez et al .",
    "2009 ) , and it has also been tested using stellar diameters and absolute flux spectra ( casagrande et al .",
    "our temperatures are also very precise because for most stars the interstellar ( is ) nai d lines were used in the determination of e(b - v ) ( see e.g. ramrez et al .",
    "2006 ) , implying thus in relatively low errors in our irfm effective temperatures .",
    "an example of a nearby halo star ( hd 140283 ) showing no detectable is nad lines ( e(b - v ) = 0.00 ) is presented in fig . 1 .",
    "our work shows that li is depleted in spite plateau stars ( fig .",
    "the spread of the spite plateau at any metallicity is much larger than the error bar , as can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "2 . also , there is a correlation between li and stellar mass at any probed metallicity ( fig .",
    "3 ) , showing thus that li has been depleted in spite plateau stars at any metallicity . in fig .",
    "3 we confront the stellar evolution predictions of @xcite with our inferred stellar masses and li abundances .",
    "the models include the effects of atomic diffusion , radiative acceleration and gravitational settling but moderated by a parametrized turbulent mixing .",
    "the agreement is very good when adopting a turbulent model of t6.25 and an initial @xmath7 . the stellar nlte li abundances used above were obtained with the latest marcs models ( gustafsson et al .",
    "2008 ) , but if we use instead the kurucz convective overshooting models , then the required initial abundance to explain our data would be @xmath8 .",
    "our results imply that the li abundances observed in li plateau stars have been depleted from their original values and therefore do not represent the primordial li abundance ( see also korn et al .",
    "2006 and lind et al .",
    "2009 for additional signatures of li depletion in stars of the globular cluster ngc 6397 ) .",
    "it appears that the observed li abundances in metal - poor stars can be reasonably well reconciled with the predictions from standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( e.g. cyburt et al .",
    "2008 ) by means of more realistic stellar evolution models that include li depletion through diffusion and turbulent mixing ( richard et al . 2005 ) .",
    "we caution however , that , although encouraging , our results should not be viewed as proof of the correctness of the richard et al .",
    "models until the free parameters required for the stellar modeling are better understood from basic physical principles . in this context , new physics should not be discarded yet as a solution of the cosmological li discrepancy , as perhaps the low li-7 abundances in metal - poor stars might be a signature of supersymmetric particles in the early universe , which could also explain the li-6 detections in metal - poor stars ( e.g. asplund et al .",
    "2006 ; asplund & melndez 2008 ) .",
    "we are expanding our sample to have a better coverage of different evolutionary stages at all metallicities . our expanded sample ( melndez et al . 2010 )",
    "will allow us to verify if the li plateau is indeed depleted at low and high metallicities ."
