    "the multiplexing waveguide network was fabricated by means of the direct femtosecond laser inscription in fused silica glass  @xcite .",
    "it is designed to match the technical standards of the attached v - groove fiber array with @xmath47 pitch which collects the photon outcome and feeds it into single - photon click - detectors . in order to inject weak laser light , different neutral density ( nd ) filters",
    "were placed into the beam of a laser diode emitting at @xmath48 .",
    "the attenuated light was coupled into a single mode ( sm ) polarization maintaining ( pm ) fiber attached to the input wave guide of the multiplexer . for the other set of experiments , single photons of @xmath49",
    "were generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) in a bib@xmath50o@xmath51 crystal and coupled into two sm and pm fibers .",
    "one of the fibers was directly connected to a single - photon detector to provide a herald for the other twin photon , which was delivered directly to the device s injection site . by using the second photon as trigger",
    ", we can suppress any noticeable influence of dark counts . for reasons of experimental convenience ,",
    "the overall photon flux was again controlled by an appropriate choice of nd filters .",
    "the photon clicks by our apds were collected by a time tagging card capable to handle up to 16 detectors at the same time .",
    "the coincidence time window , wherein two or more clicks are interpreted as a joint event , was set to @xmath52 for all measurements . in turn , the number of measurements for attenuated laser light was determined by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the overall recording time .",
    "in contrast , the number of quantum measurements was determined by the photon flux of the trigger photons , and therefore remains independent of the coincidence time window . in both cases , the overall measurement time was chosen in a way to collect at least 100 million non - zero click events , ranging from 44 seconds up to more than 60 hours .",
    "the accuracy of the calculated @xmath39 parameter is chiefly dependent on the number of measurements . in an ideal set of data ,",
    "the frequencies @xmath55 would be distributed according to the graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "if a measurement is terminated before the highest number of joint clicks yields a non - zero quantity , it can not perfectly match the ( sub- or super- ) binomial distribution .",
    "consequently , the extracted @xmath39 parameter is subject to a systematic uncertainty .",
    "a second source of errors results from imperfections in the splitting ratio of the multiplexing device , corresponding to small deviations from the ideal case of homogeneously distributed outputs ( see fig .  [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "this also influences the coincidence click statistics and , hence , the error for the @xmath39 parameter . in turn",
    ", the resulting overall range of error defines a certain minimum count rate .",
    "we would like to emphasize that our method is capable of reliably identifying the signature of the input state , whether classical or quantum ( see fig .  [ fig:3 ] ) , without the need for any corrections or post processing of raw data .",
    "in order to analyze high order correlations of the light fields under study , we use the approach recently introduced in  @xcite . along these lines , we compute the matrix of moments @xmath56 directly from the experimental click - counting statistics @xmath57 .",
    "this is done using the expression @xmath58 . here ,",

    "it can be shown that the second principal minors of the @xmath56 can be expressed in terms of the @xmath39 parameter , and as a result for classical states the associated @xmath56 is expected to be non - negative .",
    "the positive semi - definiteness of the @xmath56 can be established through the analysis of corresponding eigenvectors and eigenvalues . in other words",
    ", the @xmath56 will be positive definite if all its eigenvalues are positive .",
    "therefore , if we find at least one negative eigenvalue , we can unequivocally conclude that the light field being characterized is non - classical .",
    "this condition is mathematically described by @xmath64 where we have defined the operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 represents the eigenvectors of @xmath56 . for a classical coherent source , the moments can be calculated analytically using the expression @xmath67)^m$ ] .",
    "this indicates that the of an ideal coherent state exhibits one positive eigenvalue given by @xmath68 , and a total of @xmath62 zero eigenvalues for @xmath32 .    here",
    ", we consider a 1-to-8 multiplexer device , which corresponds to a @xmath69 @xmath56 : @xmath70 using the measured @xmath71 , we numerically obtain the eigenvalues and eigenvectors .",
    "the results of this analysis for experimental data obtained over @xmath72 ( corresponding to windows ) are shown in tables  [ tab : si ] and  [ tab : sii ] for the classical and quantum states , respectively , whereas figure  [ fig:3 ] shows a graphical representation of these quantities .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the significance for these experimentally obtained eigenvalues can be quantified using the expression @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the standard error of the mean @xmath75 .",
    "note that the two negative eigenvalues , which unexpectedly occur in the classical case , can be considered zero since their absolute values fall within the error margin .",
    "the values of @xmath76 for all measurements are shown in the fourth column of table  [ tab : si ] , illustrating that all eigenvalues are non - negative within the range of their significance .",
    "a similar validity check was also applied for our measurements of single photon fock - states ( table  [ tab : sii ] ) . as in the previous case",
    ", we calculate the significance of the deviation from the classical bound , i.e. zero .",
    "this is done using the second eigenvector @xmath77 @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 which determines the operator test .",

    "<S> existing schemes for addressing this challenge rely on a proportional conversion of photons to electrons . as such </S>",
    "<S> , they are capable of correctly characterizing small photon fluxes , yet are limited by uncertainties in the conversion rate . in this work , we employ a divide - and - conquer approach to overcome these limitations by transforming the incident fields into uniform distributions that readily lend themselves for characterization by standard on - off detectors . since the exact statistics of the light stream are obtained from the click statistics , our technique is freely scalable to accommodate  in principle  arbitrarily large photon fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments pave the way towards genuine integrated photon - number - resolving detectors for advanced on - chip photonic quantum networks .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum information science is at the cutting edge of modern physics and technology . in this context , </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most ambitious goal is to realize scalable quantum information processing and computing based exclusively on linear optical configurations and photon - counting devices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> notably , any such optical quantum - computing scheme hinges on the ability to detect and manipulate the states of light at the single - photon level : quantum cryptography , entanglement swapping , and quantum teleportation , to name a few , would clearly be impossible without reliable single - photon - counting devices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , exact photon counts provide access to genuine photon number statistics , and in turn are the principal means of reliably establishing the non - classicality of any type of light field  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another potential application of photon - number - resolving detectors ( pnrs ) was recently highlighted in the context of coherent optical communications  @xcite , where they enable coherent optical communications with a performance superior to the standard quantum limit , even in the high mean photon number regime .    </S>",
    "<S> existing schemes for measurements at the single - photon level employ on - off detectors , e.g. avalanche photodiodes ( apds )  @xcite , and as such are inherently limited by the so - called dead time . </S>",
    "<S> when an apd is triggered , it typically remains `` blind '' for several nanoseconds thereafter , and as a result , succeeding photons impinging on the detector can not be registered  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to being detrimental to the overall detection efficiency , this effect may corrupt the very photon statistics one strives to characterize . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this saturation effect also introduces undesired correlations to the count sequences . to this date , the perhaps most noticeable scheme for pnrs is based on superconducting nanowires  @xcite . yet , on many occasions , cryogenic measurements may be impractical , or the incident photon flux may exceed the capacity of the system . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , a fundamentally different approach will be required to reconcile the demands for high speed , low noise , and maximized quantum efficiency with the ever increasing count rates required by modern technologies  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to pnrs , on - off detectors deliver well - defined `` clicks '' upon excitations with any non - zero number of photons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the by far most accessible quantum - optical measurements are click - counting statistics , instead of actual photon counts  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the question naturally arises as to whether it is possible to circumvent the limitations of on - off detectors , and to exploit these robust and widely available components to accurately measure multiple photons .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we propose , implement and characterize a photon counting device based on a multiplexed array of on - off detectors . in our arrangement , the discrete evolution dynamics of the incident light field </S>",
    "<S> is manipulated so as to distribute the photons uniformly between the individual channels . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , the click - counting statistics obtained from this type of multiplexed sensor converge to the actual photon - counting statistics as the number of independent detectors is increased  @xcite . along these lines , it becomes possible to reliably probe the non - classicality of arbitrary optical input fields in a readily scalable and integrated fashion .        </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider a stream of single - photon states being routed through a uniform 1-to-@xmath0 multiplexer and onto an array of apds ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] ; top ) . in our method , this is achieved by cascading @xmath1 stages of 50/50 beam splitters , yielding @xmath2 . under these premises , </S>",
    "<S> every single - photon will have a probability of @xmath3 to be detected in one of the @xmath0 channels . </S>",
    "<S> due to the spatially extended wave function , any two incoming photons are likely to be found in different outputs with a probability of @xmath4 : when one photon is detected , the global probability of registering the next photon in any of the remaining apds is @xmath5 times greater than in the same one . </S>",
    "<S> this remains true even if the two photons enter the system simultaneously . in this manner </S>",
    "<S> , the fidelity of the device improves with the number of output ports , and is even independent of the type of input state  @xcite .    to experimentally demonstrate the functionality of our approach , we realized a discrete network of integrated 50/50 beam splitters cascaded in @xmath6 steps , yielding a total of @xmath7 output channels . </S>",
    "<S> these photonic structures were implemented in fused silica glass by means of the femtosecond laser writing technique  @xcite , see appendix  [ app : methods ] . </S>",
    "<S> as input states we consider the two limiting cases : i ) low - intensity laser light , which can be idealized as a quantum coherent state  @xcite . as such , </S>",
    "<S> its statistics feature substantial yet temporally fluctuating bunching of photons , making it a perfect test case for the photon number resolving capabilities of our setup . </S>",
    "<S> ii ) heralded single photons from a spontaneous parametric down conversion source , which approximately represent the ideal scenario of single - photon fock states  @xcite .    in the multiplexer , classical coherent states @xmath8 </S>",

    "<S> consequently , a perfect photon counting characterization should yield a poissonian photon number distribution . </S>",
    "<S> when one instead evaluates the counting click coincidences , it can be analytically shown that the resulting click - counting statistics have to follow a binomial distribution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that in case of a sub- ( or super- ) poissonian photon number distribution , it likewise follows that the click statistics are sub- ( or super- ) binomial , respectively ( see for instance fig .  </S>",

    "<S> , the exponential operator corresponds to the projector of the vacuum operator , and as expectation value yields the probability of zero clicks  @xcite .    in order to quantify the binomial character of the click - counting statistics , we employ the parameter @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the average number of clicks and the variance thereof , respectively  @xcite . for an ideal coherent state , </S>",
    "<S> the mean and the variance of the click - counting statistics are analytically calculated as @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively , with @xmath28 $ ] . when substituting these two expressions into eq .   </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath29 regardless of the quantum efficiency and the dark count rate . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , it is a sufficient criterion to differentiate between classical and non - classical light : while super - binomial click statistics such as these of realistic laser light are characterized by @xmath30 , genuine quantum entities , such as fock states , necessarily features @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> note that in order for this parameter to be meaningful , the ensemble has to include @xmath32 on - off detectors , otherwise measurements of any input state would produce @xmath29  @xcite .    in a first set of experiments , we measured the absolute number of click coincidences @xmath33 and the relative frequencies @xmath34 for attenuated laser light , where @xmath35 again represents the number of clicks within a time window of @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the total number of time windows . </S>",
    "<S> further details on our setup are given in the appendix  [ app : methods ] . </S>",
    "<S> from these measurements , we extract a positive value @xmath38 , confirming that the click statistics is indeed super - binomial as expected for a classical coherent state . beyond the @xmath39 parameter , which relies solely on second - order correlations </S>",
    "<S> , one can also employ the higher - order correlations contained within the matrix of moments to identify non - classical behavior ( see appendix  [ app : si ] ) .    in our second set of experiments </S>",
    "<S> , we used our device to characterize the fidelity of a heralded single - photon source based on spontaneous parametric down conversion . </S>",
    "<S> as in the previous case , the input state @xmath40 is spatially distributed and thus transformed according to the expression @xmath41 , where @xmath42 represents the bosonic creation operators of the @xmath43 waveguide mode . </S>",
    "<S> the high fidelity of our device is confirmed by the homogeneity of the single photon number output distribution with an average of @xmath44 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] ; bottom ) . </S>",
    "<S> measurement data clearly demonstrates the non - classicality of the input state , with @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we analyzed the dependence of the fidelity of our device for different source brightness levels . to this end , we determined the @xmath39 parameter for classical laser light with different attenuation ratios , as well as for fock states at different count rates . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:3 ] illustrates that our scheme allows for a clear distinction between classical and non - classical behavior . </S>",
    "<S> note that , as the incident intensity decreases , the chance of multiple photons entering the device in any given time slot gradually converges to zero , as does the corresponding @xmath39 parameter . whereas the sign of @xmath39 remains well defined throughout this process , the uncertainty determined by the experimental conditions [ see appendix  [ app : methods ] ] eventually exceeds the absolute value . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , standard quantum sources routinely feature count rates well above this limit , placing them firmly within the window of confidence of our characterization scheme .     for two different click statistics versus a variation of the average click number @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset shows a semilogarithmic section for the smallest achieved @xmath46s . </S>",
    "<S> an attenuated laser light ( blue curve ) is always accompanied by a positive @xmath39 ( super - binomial ) , whereas our single photon source ( green curve ) constantly shows a negative @xmath39 ( sub - binomial ) . in both cases , a coherent state ( binomial photon number distribution ) </S>",
    "<S> is covered within the error - bars at very low count rates . </S>",
    "<S> , width=283 ]    in conclusion , we have introduced a new paradigm for integrated photon - number resolved measurements based on distributed sensing with multiplexed arrays of conventional on - off detectors . in this divide - and - conquer approach , the limiting factor of detector dead time </S>",
    "<S> is overcome by transforming the incident fields into extended uniform distributions . as such , coincidences in the same measurement channel </S>",
    "<S> are reliably suppressed even for highly multi - photon input states . </S>",
    "<S> measuring the click statistics of the detector ensemble therefore provides the means to determine the actual photon - counting statistics . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , our technique can in principle be scaled to allow for arbitrarily high numbers of incident photons , irrespective of the dead time of the individual detectors used . on a higher level , similar multiplexing schemes could even be employed to boost the performance of pnr detectors relying on other mechanisms of registration . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments pave the way towards genuine integrated photon - number - resolving detectors for advanced on - chip photonic quantum networks . </S>"
