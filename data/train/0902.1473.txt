    "our knowledge of high energy physics is limited to energies approximately less than one tev . a possible candidate for new physics above the tev scale is supersymmetry ( susy ) @xcite .",
    "susy provides a solution for the higgs mass problem , a candidate for cold dark matter , and unification of low energy gauge couplings by introducing superpartners to standard model ( sm ) fields ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "alternatives to susy are extra - dimensional models , such as large extra dimensions @xcite , warped braneworlds @xcite and universal extra dimensions @xcite . in these models , gravity becomes strong at the tev scale .",
    "the most astounding consequences of tev - scale gravity would be the production of mini black holes ( bhs ) @xcite and real / virtual gravitons @xcite in particle colliders and cosmic ray showers .",
    "both susy and extra dimensions are essential ingredients of string theory @xcite .",
    "the string scale is defined as @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the slope parameter with units of inverse energy squared .",
    "the strength of string interactions is controlled by the string coupling @xmath3 .",
    "the planck scale @xmath4 is related to the string scale @xmath5 by @xmath6 since string effects are expected to appear just before quantum gravity effects set in @xcite , the string coupling is generally assumed to be of order one . in this scenario ,",
    "the string scale is close to the planck scale .",
    "however , in the presence of large extra dimensions gravity becomes strong at the tev scale . in this case",
    "the planck scale and the string scale are both @xmath7 1 tev ; string resonances would be observed at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) before the onset of non - perturbative quantum gravity effects .",
    "detection of string events at the lhc @xcite through corrections to sm amplitudes would be the most direct evidence of this scenario .",
    "the aim of this article is to present a detailed analysis of string resonances at the lhc in the @xmath0 channel @xcite .",
    "( for a discussion of different channels see , e.g. , ref .  @xcite . )",
    "the main result of our investigation is that string resonances may be distinguishable from the sm background .",
    "the relevant process for @xmath0 events is gluon - gluon scattering : @xmath8 .",
    "the string amplitude for this process is @xcite @xmath9 ^ 2+(s\\longleftrightarrow t)+(s\\longleftrightarrow u)\\right\\ } , \\label{string_amp}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mandelstam variables and @xmath13 here @xmath14=3 is the number of @xmath15 branes needed to generate the eight gluons of the sm , @xmath16 is a constant parameter , and @xmath17 , where @xmath18=0.02 and @xmath19 are the mixing parameter and the weinberg angle , respectively .",
    "the values of the parameters are chosen as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "the amplitude is @xmath22}\\left\\{\\frac{\\gamma(t / m_s^2+n)}{\\gamma(t / m_s^2 + 1)}\\right\\}^2 .",

    "( [ string_amp1 ] ) with the substitution @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the square bracket term .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the singularities of the amplitude are smeared with a fixed width @xmath25 for all @xmath26 and as @xmath27 for @xmath20=1 . equation  ( [ eq4 ] ) includes a correction for spin dependent widths : @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the strong coupling constant .",
    "the presence of the poles indicates the formation of string resonances .",
    "the total cross section for the @xmath31 event is obtained by integrating the parton cross section over the cteq6d parton distribution functions of the protons @xmath32",
    "@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the four - momentum transfer squared and @xmath35 the choice of cteq6d parton distribution functions allows direct comparison of our results to those of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] shows the differential cross section of the @xmath36 process with total center - of - mass energy @xmath37 @xmath38 the differential cross section shows resonances at @xmath39 .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] shows the total cross section as a function of the minimum transverse momenta of the two outgoing particles of the @xmath40 scattering , @xmath41 .",
    "the string cross section for @xmath5=1 tev ( solid red line ) and the cross section for @xmath5=2 tev ( dashed green line ) are @xmath7 5@xmath42 and @xmath43 times less than the sm cross section , respectively .",
    "our sample run of @xmath44 events produced @xmath7 9300 ( 220 ) string events for @xmath5=1  ( 2 ) tev , with an integrated lhc luminosity of @xmath45 .",
    "string resonances at the lhc are simulated with a fortran monte carlo code interfaced with pythia @xcite .",
    "event - shape variables are a powerful discriminator of string events from the sm background .",
    "their effectiveness is further increased by an analysis of events with high-@xmath46 photons .",
    "string events are characterized by high values of visible energy and missing transverse momentum as the photon and the jet originate directly from the @xmath40 interaction .",
    "isolated photons provide a further means to extract string signals .",
    "being directly produced from the string resonance , isolated photons from string interactions are harder than sm photons .",
    "we fix @xmath41=50 gev for both string and sm events which results into a signal - to - background ratio of @xmath7 73 .",
    "this choice is justified as follows . for low values of @xmath41 the string cross section",
    "is highly suppressed @xmath47 the sm cross section , for example @xmath48 for @xmath41  =  10 gev .",
    "therefore , discrimination of string events from the sm background is difficult for events with low @xmath41 . at higher values of @xmath41 both the sm background and the signal",
    "are substantially reduced .",
    "for example , at 300 gev they are reduced by a factor of @xmath7 98% and @xmath7 42% @xmath47 values the at @xmath41  =  50 gev , respectively .",
    "thus the optimal signal - to - background ratio is obtained for @xmath49 100 gev .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the visible energy ( left panel ) and the transverse momentum of hadrons+photons ( right panel ) for 10 million string+sm and sm - only events .",
    "the visible energy and the transverse momentum are produced by the hard photons and the jets of the string decay .",
    "their distributions are characterized by a long tail at high energy / momentum .",
    "the observation of events with visible energy ( transverse momentum ) greater than 6  ( 3 ) tev would provide strong evidence of the formation of a string resonance .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows histograms for different event shape variables .",
    "string+sm interactions generally produce a distribution of high @xmath46 jets at slightly higher values than the sm background , i.e. string events tend to be more spherical than sm events .",
    "the jets originate from the decay of string resonances into photons and hadrons .",
    "the sm generates less heavier jets than string resonances .",
    "this is evident from the middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    in the analysis of dijets ,",
    "the jets are selected according to the following criteria .",
    "the detector is assumed to have an absolute value of pseudorapidity @xmath50  =  2.6 .",
    "this ensures that the jets are originated in the hard @xmath40 scattering rather than in multiple interactions or from the beam remnants .",
    "the contribution of jets which do not originate in the hard scattering are minimized by fixing the the minimum transverse energy of all particles comprising the jet ( @xmath51 ) to 40 gev @xcite .",
    "the particles of the jet must be within a cone of @xmath52  =  0.5 from the jet initiator , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the azimuthal and polar angles of the particle @xmath55 the beam axis , respectively .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the invariant mass plot of the two jets with highest @xmath46 in each event .",
    "due to the nature of the interaction , the bulk of the events ( both string+sm and sm ) are comprised of dijets .",
    "these were selected using the above cuts .",
    "the jet invariant mass is @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the mass , energy and momenta of jet 1  ( 2 ) , respectively .",
    "as expected , the sm invariant mass distribution is negligible beyond @xmath7 4 tev .",
    "this is due to the production of direct soft photons and jets from the sm interaction .",
    "the string+sm distribution is characterized by a long tail up to energies of several tev ( three times more than the sm ) .",
    "this tail is originated from the decay of string resonances into hard jets and photons .",
    "therefore , the measure of a large invariant mass could provide strong evidence of a string - mediated interaction .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the distribution of the highest @xmath58 of isolated photons for string+sm and sm - only events .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the cuts on the photon are @xmath59 80 gev , @xmath60 2.6 and an isolation cut @xmath61 7 gev in a cone of @xmath62  =  0.4 . the photons from string resonances are expected to have a higher @xmath58 than the sm photons because they are the direct products of the string decay .",
    "the main sources of background for direct photons are jet fluctuations and photons originating from the initial and final state radiation @xcite . in the former case ,",
    "a jet consists of a few particles including high-@xmath46 mesons ( generally @xmath63 @xcite ) . the pions decay into a pair of photons with a @xmath7 99% branching ratio . due to the high boost , the photons have a relatively small angular separation and therefore  fake \" a single photon in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the rate of this process is 1 out of @xmath64 events @xcite .",
    "other sources of fake photons are @xmath65 @xcite or processes from other exotic phenomena , e.g. susy @xcite or large extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "isolation cuts on the photon can effectively reduce the number of fake photons .",
    "we have investigated string resonances at the lhc and shown how to differentiate them from the sm background .",
    "our analysis has proven that string resonances could be detected when @xmath66 1 tev .",
    "string events show higher sphericity and higher visible energy than the sm background . these quantities allow discrimination of string events from sm background when combined with the measure of the @xmath46 of isolated photons and the dijet invariant mass .",
    "since the final products of the string resonances are directly produced from the string decay , the dijet invariant mass is characterized by a tail at high energies which is absent in the sm .",
    "other exotic phenomena could also be observed at the lhc near the tev scale , such as the formation of bhs . a powerful way of discriminating between bh and string events would be searching for a @xmath67 mass peak in the invariant mass of high-@xmath46 leptons .",
    "@xmath67 production is highly suppressed in case of string events @xcite . on the contrary bh decay",
    "is characterized by the production of a variety of particles with high transverse momentum .",
    "a rough counting of the number of degrees of freedom of these particles shows that the estimated rate of hadron - to - lepton production is 5:1 and the rate of @xmath67 and @xmath68 production is comparable ( @xmath7 2% to 3% ) with the @xmath67 bosons decaying into opposite - sign leptons with a 3.4% branching ratio .",
    "thus the invariant mass distribution of bh events peaks at @xmath7 92 gev , confirming the production of a @xmath67 boson @xcite .",
    "the presence of a peak at @xmath7 92 gev in the invariant mass of leptons would effectively rule out formation of string resonances .",
    "the authors would like to thank l.  a.  anchordoqui for his many valuable suggestions and comments .",
