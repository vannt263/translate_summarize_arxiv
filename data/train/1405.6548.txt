    "in this article we give a new formula for the solution of the dirichlet problem for the homogeneous real and complex equation ( hrma / hcma ) on the product of either a convex domain and euclidean space in the real case , or a tube domain and a khler manifold in the complex case .",
    "this is partly inspired by kiselman s minimum principle @xcite and recent work of ross  witt - nystrm @xcite .",
    "our formula involves the convex- or plurisubharmonic - envelope of a family of functions on the euclidean space or the manifold , and the legendre transform on the convex domain .",
    "consequently , one could hope to develop the existence and regularity theory for both weak and strong solutions using such a formula . in this article and in its sequels",
    "we develop this approach .",
    "the regularity properties of the legendre transform are classical .",
    "thus , one is naturally led to study the regularity properties of the convex- or plurisubharmonic - envelope of a family of functions . in the case of single function with bounded second derivatives , the regularity of such envelopes",
    "was studied by benoist  hiriart - urruty , griewank ",
    "rabier , and kirchheim  kristensen , @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in the convex case , and by berman and berman ",
    "demailly @xcite in the plurisubharmonic ( psh ) setting .",
    "the convex- or psh - envelope of a family of functions is , by definition , the corresponding envelope of the ( pointwise ) infimum of that family .",
    "however , already when the family consists of two functions , their minimum is only lipschitz .",
    "thus , our second goal here is to extend the aforementioned regularity results to such a setting .",
    "the approach we take to achieve this goal is to study , more generally , the analogous _",
    "subharmonic envelope_. the subharmonic envelope of a ` rooftop obstacle ' of the form @xmath0 is , of course , just the solution of the free - boundary problem for the laplace equation associated to this obstacle .",
    "our first regularity result concerning envelopes is that the solution to the free - boundary problem for the laplace equation associated to a such a rooftop obstacle , for functions @xmath1 with finite @xmath2 norm , also has finite @xmath2 norm , along with an a priori estimate . aside from basic regularity tools from the theory of free - boundary problems associated to the laplacian ,",
    "this involves a new a priori estimate on the size of a ball that lies between the rooftop and the envelope .",
    "this result stands in contrast to the results of petrosyan  to @xcite that show that the subharmonic - envelope is @xmath3 and no better for more general rootop obstacles .",
    "since the subharmonic - envelope always lies above both the convex- and the psh - envelope this allows us to establish the regularity of the latter envelopes as well .    an important application that makes",
    "an essential use of our results is the determination of the mabuchi metric completion of the space of khler potentials , that is treated in a sequel @xcite .",
    "our first result concerns a new formula for the solution of the hrma / hcma on certain product spaces . while the real result resembles the complex result , it is not implied by it directly .",
    "thus , we split the exposition into two (  [ hcmrsubsec][hrmrsubsec ] ) .",
    "our second result concerns the regularity of subharmonic- , convex- , and psh - envelopes of a ` rooftop ' obstacle .",
    "the regularity of the latter two (  [ cvxpshregsubsec ] ) is a consequence of that of the former (  [ fbpsubsec ] ) . in passing",
    ", we also establish the lipschitz regularity of the psh - envelope associated to a general lipschitz obstacle .",

    "denote by @xmath6 ( considered as a subset of @xmath7 ) the convex tube with base @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the natural projection , and denote by @xmath10 the set of @xmath11-plurisubharmonic functions .",
    "we seek bounded @xmath12invariant solutions @xmath13 of the problem [ hcmaeq ] ( _ 2^+i)^n+k=0 , = v , where the boundary data @xmath14 is bounded , @xmath12invariant and @xmath15 .",

    "we let [ legtrans1eq ] f^(,z)=f^():=_sk[f(s , z)-,s ] .",
    "this is the _ negative _ of the usual legendre transform solely in the @xmath8-variables , in particular , it maps convex functions to concave functions , and vice versa . despite this , we also refer to it sometimes as the partial legendre transform , and we often omit the dependence of the function on the @xmath27 variables in the notation . here",

    "conversely , if @xmath39 is a function on @xmath40 taking values in @xmath41 , where @xmath38 is considered as the dual vector space to the copy of @xmath38 containing @xmath8 , then [ legtrans2eq ] g^(s , z)=g^(s):=_^k[g(,z)+,s ] .",
    "note that @xmath42 if and only if @xmath43 is convex , lower semicontinuous and nowhere equal to @xmath44 ( we do not allow the constant function @xmath44 ) , and otherwise @xmath45 is the convexification of @xmath43 , namely , the largest convex function majorized by @xmath43 @xcite .",

    "kristensen @xcite , and by caffarelli ( * ? ? ?",

    "theorem [ pregthm ] ( i ) is the analogous fact for psh - envelopes .",
    "the psh - envelope of a family of functions , e.g. , @xmath63 is of course the psh - envelope of the single function @xmath107 that is in general only lipschitz .",
    "thus , the point of theorem [ pregthm ] ( ii)(iii ) is that for special lipschitz functions of the form @xmath108 that we refer to as _ rooftop functions _ ( see figure [ figp(v0v1 ) ] )",

    "the key step is to show that there exists a @xmath109 function @xmath110 ( a ` barrier ' ) _ along with an a priori estimate _ depending only on the respective norms of the @xmath103 , such that @xmath110 lies below @xmath107 but above @xmath63 .",
    "the barrier we construct is actually obtained by first constructing local _ subharmonic - envelopes _ of @xmath89 and @xmath90 on coordinate charts .",
    "this construction is mostly based on well - known techniques from the study of the free boundary laplace equation , see , e.g. , @xcite , but with one essential new ingredient , that we now describe .",

    "yet , also in the literature on subharmonic - envelopes we were not able to find the regularization statement for rooftop obstacles of the form @xmath107 although it might very well be known to experts .",
    "thus , the main new technical ingredient is the estimate of proposition [ cushintheorem ] that guarantees that around each point in the set @xmath111 there exists a ball of a priori estimable size that stays away from the _ contact set _ , i.e. , the set where the local subharmonic envelope equals the barrier @xmath107 . given this estimate ,",
    "the standard quadratic growth estimate carries over to our setting , and one obtains a priori estimates on @xmath110 .",
    "then , since the subharmonic - envelope necessarily majorizes the psh - envelope , we get @xmath112 , to which one may apply berman  demailly s results .",

    "perhaps the novel point in our approach , compared to such an extension , is that it also gives , in passing , a useful result concerning the obstacle problem for the laplacian , and thus proves the regularity of the subharmonic- , convex- , and psh - envelopes , all at once .      a combination of theorem [ envdual ] and theorem [ pregthm ] ( i ) gives fiberwise lipschitz regularity of the bremermann upper envelope @xmath24 associated to fiberwise lipschitz boundary data",

    "when @xmath24 does solve the hcma then other techniques exist , notably s lipschitz estimate @xcite",
    ". however , even then our method seems to be new in that it furnishes fiberwise lipschitz regularity given the same on the boundary data , while s estimate alone gives full lipschitz regularity starting from full ( also in the @xmath117 directions ) lipschitz regular data .",
