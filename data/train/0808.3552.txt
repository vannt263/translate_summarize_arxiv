    "the experimental observation of vortex lattices in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) @xcite has stimulated intense theoretical interest and debate over the mechanisms involved in vortex formation .",
    "while vortex lattices had previously been observed in superconductors and superfluid helium , dilute gas becs offer the possibility of a quantitative description of the formation process using tractable theory .",
    "the experiments can be divided broadly into two categories : ( i ) a thermal gas rotating in an axially symmetric trap is evaporatively cooled and condenses into a rotating lattice  @xcite ; ( ii ) a low temperature condensate ( @xmath1 ) is rotationally stirred , and vortices then nucleate and form a vortex lattice  @xcite .",
    "the first category of experiment is conceptually simplest , and the origin of dissipative processes is well understood @xcite .",
    "the second category of experiment is the subject of this paper , and as observed by a number of groups , has more complicated phenomenology .",
    "we shall concentrate on a typical , representative example , in which the condensate is initially in the interacting ground state of a cylindrically symmetric harmonic trap at a temperature very close to @xmath0 . stirring is implemented by distorting the trap to elliptical symmetry , and rotating it at the frequency of the condensate quadrupole mode .",
    "this excites a dynamical instability in which the condensate is transformed into a turbulent state , which later evolves into a rotating state containing a regular vortex lattice .",
    "this process of vortex lattice formation by stirring provides a unique testbed for dynamical theories of cold bosonic gases , as noted by other authors @xcite . beginning from a well characterised initial state ,",
    "the application of a simply defined experimental procedure causes a violent transformation into a highly excited and disordered state , from which an ordered state subsequently emerges .",
    "the workhorse of bec theory , the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) , can provide a good dynamical description of @xmath0 condensates , and has given a very good understanding of the initiation of the dynamical instability @xcite . the subsequent evolution into",
    "a highly excited state is clearly beyond the validity regime of pure gp theory .",
    "@xcite recognised the need for a new theoretical framework after noting that dissipation is required to evolve an initially non - rotating gpe ground state into a state in equilibrium with the stirrer .",
    "they postulated that a rotating thermal cloud develops to provide this dissipation ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and modelled its effects by adding a phenomenological damping term to the gpe  @xcite , later justified  @xcite on the basis of the formalism of jackson and zaremba @xcite .",
    "further calculations employing the gpe were performed by parker _",
    "@xcite , and these 2d simulations gave rise to crystallization of a low energy vortex lattice , in conflict with earlier simulations of the gpe in 2d @xcite that did not exhibit lattice formation .",
    "it is of interest to identify the origin of this discrepancy and to determine the nature of the final state to be expected in stirring experiments of 2d bose gases .    in this paper",
    "we apply classical field theory , a representation of many - body physics capable of modelling the dynamical behaviour of both the condensate and excited states of the matter field .",
    "the formalism for classical field theory has been developed recently in a number of papers @xcite , and it has been used to describe several phenomena where thermal fluctuations play a critical role in determining the dynamical behaviour of the system , including : the condensation transition @xcite , effects of critical fluctuations on the transition temperature @xcite , activation of vortices in quasi-2d systems @xcite , collapse dynamics of attractive bose gases @xcite , and coherence properties of spinor condensates @xcite . lobo _",
    "@xcite have used a version of classical field theory to describe vortex lattice formation by stirring , and their results indicate that the thermal field component generated provides the damping necessary for the lattice to form . here",
    "we will apply an implementation of classical field theory which conserves particle number and rotating frame energy , and uses a basis choice and numerical method that has appropriate boundary conditions and is free from numerical artifacts .",
    "this allows us to provide a detailed and quantitative description of the thermalization of the condensate , and the nucleation and motional damping of vortices which is responsible for lattice formation .",
    "we find that the system relaxes to a state containing a disordered distribution of vortices , in thermal and rotational equilibrium with a cloud of thermal atoms generated by the stirring process .",
    "the theory of the trapped bose gas can be written in terms of the second quantized hamiltonian for the field operator @xmath2 where the operators satisfy bosonic commutation relations @xmath3=\\delta_{nm}$ ] , and the modes @xmath4 are any complete orthonormal basis . in the s - wave interaction regime",
    "the hamiltonian for the system is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the scattering length and @xmath8 is the atomic mass .",
    "the single particle hamiltonian is generally of the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 and we have expressed the single particle hamiltonian in a frame rotating at angular frequency @xmath11 about the @xmath12-axis and decomposed the external trapping potential into @xmath13 we have singled out @xmath14 in eqs .",

    "we will always drive the system within the hydrodynamic resonance , choosing @xmath25 .",
    "the sudden turn - on of the rotating potential at fixed @xmath26 , means that the rotating frame energy ( the quantum average of eq .",
    "( [ fullh ] ) ) is a conserved quantity of the motion .    for computational reasons",
    "we now restrict our attention to an effective two dimensional system .",
    "such systems have been experimentally realised ( e.g. , @xcite ) by setting the trapping frequency @xmath27 sufficiently high that no modes are excited in the @xmath12 direction .",
    "a 2d description of our system is thus valid provided that @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the system chemical potential and temperature respectively .",
    "provided that the oscillator length @xmath31 corresponding to the @xmath12 confinement greatly exceeds the s - wave scattering length @xmath7 , the scattering is well described by the usual 3d contact potential @xcite , and we obtain an effective two - dimensional equation in which the collisional interaction parameter is simply rescaled to @xmath32 @xcite . in this work we consider @xmath33na atoms confined in a strongly oblate trap , with trapping frequencies @xmath34 .",
    "the s - wave scattering length is @xmath35 and the oscillator length @xmath36 .",
    "having chosen appropriate parameters , in the next section we make the dimensional reduction formally rigorous by introducing an energy cutoff into the theory which excludes all excited @xmath12-axis modes .      in projected classical field theory a cutoff energy @xmath37",
    "is introduced to separate the system into a low energy region ( * l * ) with single particle energies satisfying @xmath38 , and a high energy region ( * h * ) containing the remaining modes .",
    "following @xcite we shall refer to these regions as the condensate and non - condensate bands , respectively .",
    "this separation is motivated by the expectation that low energy modes will be significantly occupied .",
    "where possible it is most convenient to carry out the separation in the basis which diagonalizes the single particle hamiltonian of the system since at high energies ( @xmath39 ) the many - body hamiltonian ( eq .  [ fullh ] ) is approximately diagonal in this basis ( i.e. , at such an energy a cutoff imposed at a single particle energy is approximately parallel to one imposed at an energy of the interacting system ) .    for certain potentials an appropriate numerical quadrature method exists which also greatly expedites simulations .",
    "any numerical representation of field theory on a computer is also subject to a restriction of the modes .",
    "in what follows we provide an explicit connection between the cutoff in our theory and our numerical implementation .",
    "we begin by introducing the projected field operator @xmath40 where the projector is defined as @xmath41 the summation is over all modes satisfying @xmath42 , where @xmath43 defines the modes in terms of a time independent single particle hamiltonian in the rotating frame .",
    "choosing @xmath44 , all excited @xmath12-axis modes are excluded from this set . in the s - wave limit , the effective low energy hamiltonian for the system",
    "is then given by @xmath45 we now obtain a classical theory by making the replacement @xmath46 in @xmath47 to give @xmath48 this approach is based on the high occupation condition , where it is known that classical behaviour is recovered for highly occupied bosonic modes since commutators become relatively unimportant  @xcite .",
    "we then obtain the equation of motion for the classical field via projected functional differentiation of the classical field hamiltonian  @xcite : @xmath49 the resulting equation of motion , the _ projected _ gross - pitaevskii equation ( pgpe ) @xmath50 satisfies several identities governing the evolution of total number @xmath51 , rotating frame energy @xmath52 , and angular momentum @xmath53",

    "the terms involving the imaginary part of an integral are boundary terms arising in the projected classical field theory .",
    "although we work in the frame where @xmath58 , eqs .",

    "( [ pdef ] ) is in principle arbitrary .",
    "however , in order that we recover the formal properties of the continuous classical field theory , the boundary terms in eqs .",
    "( [ lzdot ] ) , ( [ edot ] ) must be made to vanish .",
    "this is ensured by expanding @xmath59 in eigenstates of @xmath60 , which is equivalent to requiring the projection operator to have rotational symmetry : @xmath61\\equiv [ { \\cal q},l_z]=0 $ ] .",
    "we then have @xmath62 and we see that our choice of @xmath63 given in sec .",
    "[ sec : system ] generates the appropriate rotating frame classical field theory .",
    "the remaining potential @xmath64 is not diagonal in our representation , but since it is only a weak perturbation the many - body hamiltonian will remain approximately diagonal in the eigenstates of @xmath65 near the cutoff energy @xmath37 . with this choice of basis , we recover @xmath66 , and @xmath67 as required .",
    "we emphasize that for certain potentials there exists an exact numerical quadrature method for evolving the pgpe which implements the projection operator to machine precision for a given energy cutoff .",
    "such a method exists for our choice of @xmath14  @xcite and consequently there is an exact numerical correspondence between the formal properties of the classical field theory expressed in eqs .",
    "( [ ndot])-([edot ] ) and the results of pgpe simulation .",
    "pgpe evolution via numerical quadrature in the basis of @xmath60 eigenstates is thus free of boundary term artifacts , and we have obtained an appropriate hamiltonian classical field theory in the rotating frame .      we have thus far confined our discussion to pure classical field theory without recourse to phase - space methods . having established the appropriately conserving formalism we also include vacuum noise in our initial conditions , following the prescription of the truncated wigner ( tw ) method  @xcite .",
    "the classical field @xmath68 is formally related to the field operator @xmath69 by the wigner function phase - space representation @xcite , and thus even at zero temperature the initial state of @xmath68 in any trajectory contains a representation of the vacuum fluctuations in the form of classical ( complex ) gaussian noise of mean population equal to @xmath70-quantum per mode .",
    "it is of concern , then , to choose appropriate basis modes to which the noise is added ( not to be confused with the basis modes in which the system is propagated ) , so as to faithfully represent the ground state of the many - body system @xcite .",
    "while higher order approaches which take account of the mutual interaction between the condensate and bogoliubov modes exist  @xcite , in this work our primary aim is to include the possibility of spontaneous processes in the initial condition .",
    "it therefore suffices to populate the bogoliubov modes orthogonal to the condensate mode with noise  @xcite .",
    "the initial state is constructed from the gp ground state of the symmetric trap in the lab frame , @xmath71 , as @xmath72 where @xmath73 are the bogoliubov modes orthogonal to @xmath71 , @xmath74 , and for our system the thermal population @xmath75 is zero .",
    "the independent gaussian distributed variables satisfy @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "population of the quasiparticle basis constructed in this manner ensures that all surface modes of the condensate ( that are resolvable within the condensate band ) are effectively seeded by noise .",
    "the dynamically unstable excitations of the condensate in the presence of the rotating trap anisotropy are among those seeded , and the noise introduced here thus plays a role entirely analogous to that played by vacuum electromagnetic field fluctuations in triggering the spontaneous decay of a two - level atom @xcite .",
    "all symmetries of the mean - field state are thus broken @xcite _ before _ the exponential growth of non - condensed field density @xcite occurring during the dynamical instability .",
    "by contrast an exact gp ground - state of the isotropic trap possesses circular rotational symmetry , and thus the _ exact _ evolution of the state under the gpe with an elliptic potential would retain unbroken twofold rotational symmetry for all time .    in any practical calculation , with finite - precision arithmetic",
    ", numerical error eventually leads to the breaking of this symmetry , and researchers propagating the gpe from such an initial state have supplemented their numerics with additional procedures to speed this process @xcite . in this work",
    "we consider an irreducible source of symmetry breaking : vacuum fluctuations .",
    "there are also more subtle reasons for using a projective method and for our choice of basis : ( i ) _ preservation of symmetries_. it is natural in modelling the field theory of particles interacting in free space , to consider the problem on a discrete spatial lattice  @xcite , effectively imposing a _ momentum _",
    "cutoff on the system .",
    "however , the inclusion of an external confining potential breaks the translational symmetry of the system , and momentum is no longer a well - conserved quantity appropriate for defining a cutoff .",
    "a projective method allows us to implement a finite dimensional field theory which best respects the remaining symmetries of the confined system ( e.g. , the conservation of total field energy ) .",
    "( ii ) _ phase space discretization_. in modelling a homogeneous system on a discrete lattice , one expects to regain the full , continuum field theory as the lattice spacing tends to zero ( i.e. , as the momentum cutoff is raised to infinity ) .",
    "however , in a confined system , a _",
    "natural _ discretization of the field theory is imposed by the quantization of energy levels in the confining potential .",
    "a cutoff defined in energy imposes both short - wavelength ( ultraviolet ) and long - wavelength ( infrared ) cutoffs _ consistently _ , and moreover , ensures that the number of modes spanning the intervening phase - space is optimally close to the true number present in the interacting system .",
    "furthermore , the choice of an energy cutoff allows us to choose a phase - space appropriate to the _ rotating frame_the frame in which final equilibrium is achieved .",
    "this has immediate consequences for the distribution of thermal energy in the system .",
    "a non - optimal discretization , such as a cartesian grid or planewave model of a trapped system , leads to somewhat arbitrary results for the number of modes , and consequently the temperature of the final equilibrium state . as we will see , our equilibrium states still have a cutoff dependent temperature , but the numerical prefactor arising from our choice of basis is close to optimal .",
    "a complete resolution of this problem requires a more general theory that includes above - cutoff corrections @xcite .",
    "boundary conditions_. methods commonly used such as fourier spectral methods  @xcite , and the crank - nicholson method  @xcite can suffer from pathologies arising from periodic boundary conditions , wave vector aliasing  @xcite , or discretization error in the calculation of derivatives ; both methods are non - projective and as such do not impose a consistent energy cutoff .",
    "for example , a model of the homogeneous bose gas implemented using the fourier spectral method will always suffer aliasing issues for any modes with momentum greater than half the maximum representable on the grid  @xcite .",
    "these issues are resolved by the use of a projective method .",
    "the system boundary is defined by the formally energy - restricted theory , and the numerically propagated basis modes and their coupling are unambiguously defined in direct correspondence to this theory .",
    "we introduce now the dimensionless units we use in our implementation of the pgpe .",
    "we use harmonic oscillator units ( @xmath78 ) related to si units ( @xmath79 ) by the expressions @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , where the radial oscillator length @xmath84 . in reporting our results",

    "most importantly , the change in rotating frame _ energy _ is of magnitude commensurate with that of that change in normalisation , so that the truncation error represents a loss of population from the system as a whole , rather than a preferential removal of high - energy components as in @xcite , and the relaxation of the condensate band field is thus due to internal damping processes only .",
