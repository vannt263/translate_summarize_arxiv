    "the generation of classically distinguishable quantum states , a major endeavor of modern physics , has long been the object of extensive theoretical studies . in recent times",
    "important experimental investigation with atoms has been carried out in this field by various research groups @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . in this context",
    "it has been proved that the realization of the schroedinger - cat program is generally challenged by an extremely rapid decoherence process due to the stochastic interactions of any freely evolving _  _ mesoscopic system with the environment @xcite@xcite . within the framework of quantum computation _  _ the same process has also been recognized to represent a major limitation toward the coherent superposition of the qubits carrying the quantum information @xcite . in the domain of quantum optics several strategies have been proposed to overcome the problem , e.g. the back - action evasion @xcite and cavity control by optical feedback @xcite@xcite .  in the present letter we present a new approach to the problem based on the amplifying / squeezing operation of the travelling wave optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) operating in a novel entangled configuration and initiated by a dynamical interaction process here introduced for the first time in the framework of the nonlinear ( nl ) parametric amplification : _ quantum - injection . _ in general we may define the quantum injection process in connection with any amplifying or scattering system as the one provided by an input field whose @xmath1 does not exist as a tempered solution @xcite . in our present case",
    "the character of _ quantum - injection  _ is provided by the subpoissonian character of a single photon in the fock state n=1 in a quantum superposition of polarization , or momentum , states .",
    "sometimes we refer to this single particle state as the input _",
    "qubit_. this photon may belong to a couple generated by spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) e.g. in a @xmath2 entangled state of linear polarization @xmath3defined in a hilbert space of dimensionality @xmath4 .",
    "the spdc process has been adopted within recent tests of violation of bellinequalities @xcite , of quantum state - teleportation @xcite and of all processes generally belonging to the chapter of _ nonlocal entangled interferometry _",
    "the key idea of the present work relates to the possibility of `` amplifying '' this quite interesting phenomenology to a higher dimensionality spin-@xmath0{0xbd}}% % beginexpansion { \\frac12}% % endexpansion $ ] hilbert space , i.e. involving a large number of photon couples , by taking advantage of the _ unitary _ character of the transformation accounting for the amplification process .",
    "we show that this can be realized by a novel optical device , the quantum - injected _ , _ _ entangled opa _ leading to a new _ entangled _ schroedinger - cat ( s - cat ) configuration which may be _ decoherence - free _ , in the ideal case .",
    "a first account of the present work is found in refs.@xcite .",
    "this quite interesting condition , implying the linear superposition of two multi - particle , i.e. macroscopic_pure - states _ will be investigated for two different optical travelling - wave configurations : ( 1 ) the quantum - injected non - degenerate opa and ( 2 ) the quantum - injected mode - degenerate opa .",
    "both schemes will be analyzed theoretically by two different and complementary approaches .",
    "accordingly , the paper is organized as follows :    first , the dynamical unitary evolution of the input qubit providing the quantum injection will be analyzed in the details for the two configurations in sections 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "second , the general approach will be followed by an _",
    "exact _ , closed form evaluation of the wigner function , in sections 4 again for both configurations .",
    "the details of all calculations will be given for the more complex and elaborate configuration ( 1 ) , for generality.rather surprisingly , we shall see that the formal expression of the wigner function is found the same for both configurations in spite of the somewhat different dynamics and of the different signification of the variables appearing in the resulting expression .",
    "this may emphasize the formal role taken by the common single - photon quantum injection scheme within the quantum analysis . in any case",
    "this allows an interesting unifying wigner function analysis showing , for both configurations , the relevant multi particle quantum superposition properties of the s - cat .",
    "third , a theory of the _ first - order _ optical correlation functions of the parametrically generated field , given in section 5 suggests , for both cases , a straightforward first - order interferometric method for a direct single - beam detection of the s - cat .",
    "in addition , the detailed theoretical investigation of the _ second - order _ inter - mode correlation function leads to a bell - type multi - photon quantum nonlocal behaviour of the emitted field .",
    "at last , a new multi - particle bell - inequality experiment will be considered .",
    "consider the diagram shown in figure 1 , a diagram suggested by an actual experimental investigation presently being carried out in our laboratory .",
    "two equal and equally oriented nl  crystals , e.g. , beta - barium - borate ( bbo ) cut for type ii phase matching are excited by two beams derived from a common uv  laser beam at a wavelength ( wl ) @xmath5 .",
    "crystal 1 is the spdc source of @xmath6_entangled _ photon couples emitted , with wl @xmath7 over the modes @xmath8 @xmath9 determined by two fixed pinholes .",
    "the spdc quantum - injector is provided by a type ii @xmath2 generator of linear polarization @xmath10-entangled photon couples .",
    "the crystal realizing the opa action is cut for type ii , noncollinear phase matching and is equal to the one realizing spdc .",
    "the detection system consists of a birefringent plate @xmath11 , a @xmath12 r(@xmath13 ) , a polarizing - beam - splitter pbs and two cooled photomultipliers . in the experiment",
    "a similar system is inserted on mode @xmath14 .",
    "we found that the entanglement phase @xmath15 of the output state of the couple can be easily tuned over the range @xmath16 by rotating by an angle @xmath17 the crystal around the excitation axis @xmath18 , @xmath19 being a linear function @xcite . in order to prevent any epr type state reduction that may affect the overall superposition process and then destroy the s - cat at the outset , the photon  emitted over the output mode @xmath20 is filtered by a polarization analyzer with axis oriented at @xmath21to the horizontal ( t.h . ) before being detected by @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "an alternative solution for quantum injection , succesfully tested in the experiment , is provided by a type i nl crystal 1 feeding the opa by a single photon with @xmath23 oriented at 45@xmath24 , the other photon exciting @xmath25without any @xmath26 . in both cases ,",

    "the interaction time , t may be determined in our case by the length l of the nl crystal . the evolution operator for @xmath33 is then expressed in the form of the unitary _ squeeze operator _ : @xmath52 @xmath53 $ ] being : @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "a corresponding @xmath56 for @xmath57 is given by the replacement @xmath58 . by use of the overall propagator @xmath59 and of the disentangling theorem @xcite ,",

    "furthermore , most important , since @xmath78 is not factorizable in terms of linear polarization @xmath79 it keeps his original @xmath80_entanglement _ character thus transferring into the multi - particle regime the striking quantum nonseparability and bell - type nonlocality properties of the microscopic _  ( i.e. _ 2-particle ) systems @xcite@xcite .  the @xmath81_entanglement _ properties of the output state can be investigated experimetally either by a multi - particle bell inequality experiment , we shall consider in section 5 , or more simply and directly by the _",

    "a layout of a possible experiment of this sort applied to our s - cat condition is reported in the inset of figure 1 .",
    "consider now the diagram shown in figure 2 : the two nl  crystals , e.g. , bbo cut for type ii phase - matching , are again excited by two beams derived from the common uv  source at wavelength @xmath82 .",

    "again the photon emitted over @xmath27provides the quantum - injection into the opa consisting of the nl crystal 2 which is now cut for _ collinear _ operation over the two linear polarization modes @xmath86and @xmath87 , respectively parallel and orthogonal t.h .. the photon associated with the output mode @xmath14 is filtered by a polarization analyzer with axis at @xmath88 respect to the t.h .",

    "note , by comparison with the input state expressed by equation 1 , corresponding to the optical configuration 1 , that here two channels feeding vacuum into the nl crystal 2 are missing , since in the present _ collinear _ configuration the @xmath33 and @xmath34 collapse into a single @xmath92and the dynamics is simplified . as we shall see in section 5 this results in a larger signal - to - noise ratio of the output field . in order to investigate the properties of the output beam after filtering against uv , a birefringent plate @xmath93 and a fresnel - rhomb @xmath94 induce respectively a field s phase delay @xmath95 and a @xmath96 ) @xmath97 ( t.h . ) .",

    "we may analyze the present amplification process following the lines of the theory given in section 2 .",
    "the single @xmath100 process induces a unitary transformation on the couple of time dependent field operators : @xmath101 and @xmath102 for which , at the initial time of the nl interaction , @xmath37 is @xmath103 = \\left [ \\widehat{b}(0),\\widehat{b}% ( 0)^{\\dagger } \\right ] = 1 $ ] and @xmath104 $ ] @xmath40 .",

    "a nice example is provided there by the nonlinear generation of surface - polaritons or plasmons in strongly light absorbing semiconductors or metals @xcite . in spite of any arbitrarily large damping of the medium , high intensity and _ strictly _ _ nondecaying , _ _ driven _ polariton waves _  _ may be _  _ nonlinearly _  _ generated over arbitrarily _  _ large distances and times while the related _ free _ waves _ , _ that originate at the boundaries from the _  _ driven _  _ ones _ , _ die out quickly according to the linear optical properties of the medium .",
