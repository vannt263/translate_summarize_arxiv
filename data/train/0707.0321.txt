    "the root - mean - square displacement , @xmath0 , of a single diffusing particle at long times @xmath1 is typically proportional to @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "the same scaling law is also usually obeyed by the width of a region infiltrated by a diffusing front . however , there are also many natural phenomena where the exponent @xmath4 differs from @xmath5 .",
    "these include , for example , water absorption in porous building materials @xcite , copper sulfate diffusion into deionized water @xcite , transport in high polymer systems @xcite , diffusion through synthetic membranes @xcite , and some aspects of surface diffusion @xcite .",
    "diffusion processes with @xmath3 are ubiquitous in nature and hence called ` normal ' , whereas those with @xmath6 are quite rare and called ` anomalous ' .",
    "there are several mechanisms that are known to bring about anomalous tracer @xcite diffusion ; for example , a power - law probability distribution of waiting times between individual steps of a random walk or a power - law probability distribution of distances covered by the diffusing particle at each jump @xcite .",
    "however , far less is known about anomalous chemical @xcite diffusion , i.e.  diffusion of macroscopic quantities of matter .",
    "anomalous spreading of diffusion fronts is a many - body effect that results from complicated interactions between diffusing particles as well as between the particles and the surrounding ( e.g. porous or fractal - like ) medium . in many cases",
    "the nature of these interactions remains unknown , so actually there is no satisfactory explanation of the anomalous diffusion in these systems @xcite .",
    "thus , any progress in the theory of anomalous chemical diffusion would be much welcomed .",
    "recently kntz and lavalle @xcite suggested that anomalous chemical diffusion can be a common phenomenon in systems with concentration - dependent diffusion coefficient of the diffusing entity .",
    "they based it on extensive computer simulations of a lattice - gas automata ( lga ) model @xcite , and a refined analysis of a cuso@xmath7 front diffusion into deionized water experiment @xcite .",
    "were this conjecture correct , it could be used to identify the cause of anomalous spreading of concentration fronts in many real systems . in this paper",
    "we focus on the kntz and lavalle ( kl ) model and propose a much simpler interpretation of the simulation results obtained in @xcite .",
    "our approach indicates that the diffusion in the kl model is normal .",
    "the key to the proper interpretation of the simulation results is the fact that the kl model is an extension of the frish - hasslacher - pomeau ( fhp ) lattice gas model of fluid flow .",
    "even though kntz and lavalle applied it in a porous medium , which significantly reduced the flow velocity , hydrodynamic effects were not eliminated altogether .",
    "we found that the fluid flow velocity is large enough to enhance the effective speed of the diffusing front , apparently enlarging the value of the scaling exponent @xmath4 above @xmath5 .",
    "we show that when the flow is taken into account , the exponent @xmath4 assumes its expected , `` normal '' value @xmath5 .    in a broader perspective , our study shows that application of `` hydrodynamic '' lattice - gas automata models to study diffusion in porous media requires a great caution .",
    "special attention must be paid to modelling the porosity of the medium to ensure that there is no macroscopic flow through the system .",
    "if this is impossible , the flow , even of minute magnitude , must be explicitly taken into account in the analysis of results .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we briefly introduce the kntz - lavalle model and the main results obtained thus far . in section  [ sec : results ] we present our interpretation of these results , and show that actually there is no anomalous diffusion in the system . section [ sec : discussion ] presents discussion of the major properties of the model . finally , section [ sec : conclusions ]",
    "is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the kntz - lavalle model @xcite describes diffusion of a fluid in a porous medium and is an extension of a deterministic frish - hasslacher - pomeau ( fhp@xmath8 ) lattice - gas automata model of fluid flow @xcite .",
    "the system is reduced to a two - dimensional triangular lattice , @xmath9 lattice units ( l.u . )",
    "long and @xmath10 l.u .",
    "the total number of lattice nodes is thus @xmath11 .",
    "they are occupied by indistinguishable particles , whose velocities belong to a discrete , 7-element set ( fig .",
    "[ pic : collisionrules ] ) . any particles occupying the same lattice site must have different velocities , so that each node can be occupied by at most 7 particles .",
    "the time is discrete and at each time step particles either stay at rest ( if their speed is 0 ) or jump to the adjacent site pointed at by their velocity vector .",
    "particles arriving simultaneously at the same node may collide .",
    "the collision rules for the fhp@xmath8 model are depicted in fig .",
    "[ pic : collisionrules ] ; they conserve the mass and momentum .",
    "additionally , a porous medium is modelled by assuming that a fraction @xmath12 of randomly chosen lattice nodes is permanently occupied by the so called specular scatterers ( such scatterers behave like tiny rigid squares parallel to the `` x '' axis @xcite ) .",
    "the system is confined between rigid , impenetrable walls along the `` x '' direction , whereas periodic boundary conditions are assumed along the `` y '' direction .",
    "a characteristic feature of the model thus constructed is a strong dependence of the diffusion coefficient @xmath13 on the reduced local particle concentration @xmath14 @xcite , which is defined as the average number of particles per node divided by 7 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath13 assumes a minimum value at @xmath15 and diverges to infinity as @xmath14 goes either to @xmath16 or @xmath17 @xcite .     model .",
    "filled circles represent particles at rest .",
    "[ pic : collisionrules ] ]    initially the system is uniformly filled with particles so that the reduced concentration is @xmath18 throughout the system . to this end",
    "@xmath19 particles are distributed randomly in the system in such a way that their mean velocity vanishes and any particles occupying the same node have different velocities .",
    "next , a narrow strip of nodes at the left - hand side of the system is uniformly filled with additional particles so as to increase the reduced concentration to @xmath20 . in this way a step - like nonuniform initial condition is formed , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the heviside step function .",
    "the origin of the reference system is set to the interface between the areas of high and low initial concentration , so that @xmath23 corresponds to the initial location of the step .    during the simulation , by injecting new particles if necessary , the reduced concentration in the boundary strip @xmath24",
    "is maintained fixed at @xmath25 .",
    "this corresponds to boundary conditions that are often used in studies on water infiltration into a porous medium : @xmath26",
    "we performed extensive simulations of a concentration front propagation using a triangular lattice with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the density of scatterers @xmath29 , and the initial and boundary conditions determined by @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the results for @xmath32 , @xmath33 , are depicted in figure [ fig : densityprofiles ] as a semi - logarithmic plot .",
    "both the shape of the consecutive curves and the distances between them appear to be almost the same , which suggests that the concentration profile @xmath34 can actually be expressed as a function of a single variable @xmath35 .     as a function of position @xmath36 for @xmath37 time steps , @xmath33 .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "[ fig : densityprofiles ] ]    validity of the scaling hypothesis can be verified by plotting several concentration profiles , obtained at different times , as functions of @xmath35 .",
    "if the scaling holds , all these plots should collapse into a single curve .",
    "such analysis was already performed in @xcite , where it was found that @xmath40 .",
    "this was interpreted as an evidence that the transport in the lga model is superdiffusive ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this finding , however , leads to a paradox : how addition of scatterers can _ enhance _ transport of particles ? according to kntz and lavalle @xcite ,",
    "this paradox can be explained by two hypotheses .",
    "the first one attributes superdiffusion of particles to a very strong dependence of their diffusivity on concentration .",
    "the second one says that anomalous diffusion is actually a transient phenomenon : in the limit of time @xmath42 the scaling exponent @xmath4 will _ extremely slowly _ decrease to @xmath5 .",
    "however , this argumentation neglects a well known fact , widely used in the boltzmann - matano method @xcite , that any solution to the diffusion equation @xmath43 with the initial and boundary conditions ( [ eq : ini - cond ] ) and ( [ eq : boundary - cond ] ) , satisfy the @xmath44 scaling for all @xmath1 , irrespective of the form of @xmath45 @xcite . consequently ,",
    "absence of this scaling indicates that equation ( [ eq : diffusion - equation ] ) can not give a proper description of the concentration front dynamics in the model . besides diffusion",
    ", there must be another transport mechanism that controls particle infiltration into the low - concentration area .",
    "we conjecture that this is the fluid flow induced by a pressure gradient between the high- and low - concentration areas of the system .    to check this hypothesis , we started from detailed analysis of spacial and temporal properties of the `` x '' component of the velocity vector , @xmath46 .",
    "figure [ fig : velocity - profiles ] depicts the velocity profile at several times @xmath1 .",
    "it shows that the region @xmath47 can be split into two parts characterized by different behavior of @xmath48 .",
    "the first region coincides with the particle infiltration area .",
    "the system already `` feels '' the pressure gradient there and responds to it by developing a small but definitely nonvanishing flow towards the low concentration area .",
    "the second region is located further away from the infiltration area .",
    "the system remains there close to the initial state , with @xmath48 fluctuating around @xmath16 .",
    ", as a function of the distance from the origin , @xmath36 , for time @xmath49 .",
    "[ fig : velocity - profiles],scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to study the concentration front dynamics , one thus have to take into account the front velocity , @xmath50 . in general , this quantity is both @xmath36- and @xmath1-dependent .",
    "however , we are interested only in its approximate value at time @xmath1 , and estimate it as a mean weighted with @xmath51 , @xmath52\\,\\mathrm{d}x }           { \\displaystyle \\int_0^\\infty [ c(x , t ) - c_2]\\,\\mathrm{d}x}.\\ ] ] in this definition we utilize the fact that the weight function quickly vanishes outside the front region ( fig .  [",
    "fig : densityprofiles ] ) , while the averaged quantity , @xmath48 , remains almost constant there ( fig .",
    "[ fig : velocity - profiles ] ) .",
    "moreover , the integral form of the definition helps to significantly reduce the influence of relatively large statistical noise present in the data for @xmath48 .",
    "figure [ fig : v - t ] shows that the initial magnitude of @xmath53 is very high , almost reaching the maximum possible value @xmath17 . at larger times @xmath53 decreases as @xmath54 with @xmath55 very weakly depending on @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , the distance the front moves due to the flow , @xmath56 for large @xmath1 grows as @xmath57 , i.e.  a bit faster than the typical diffusive length @xmath58 .",
    "this suggests that the front dynamics is controlled by _ both _ diffusion and flow .",
    "actually , our simulations showed that after @xmath59 time steps the front displacement was @xmath60 l.u .",
    "( see figure [ fig : densityprofiles ] ) , of which @xmath61 l.u , that is , about 38% , was caused by the fluid flow .",
    ", as a function of time .",
    "the dashed line is a guide to the eye with a slope @xmath62 .",
    "[ fig : v - t ] , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to separate diffusion from flow , we investigated the front propagation using a mobile reference frame @xmath63 , with @xmath64 this new coordinate system moves along the `` x '' axis with velocity @xmath65 , so as to minimize effects of the fluid flow . assuming that in this new reference system the front dynamics is dominated by ( normal ) diffusion , the concentration profiles should asymptotically obey a similarity relation @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a similarity function and @xmath68 is a constant . to verify this conjecture , we first used the data for @xmath69 to estimate @xmath70 , and then plotted @xmath14 as a function of @xmath71 for several times @xmath1 .",
    "the results , obtained for @xmath72 , are shown in figure [ fig : final - scaling ] .",
    "they confirm that the concentration profiles asymptotically satisfy  ( [ eq : scaling - moving ] ) , as for @xmath73 the scaled - up profiles are practically indistinguishable .",
    "hydrodynamical flow can also explain another feature of the model ",
    "discontinuity of fluid concentration at the boundary @xmath74 .",
    "even though the boundary condition  ( [ eq : boundary - cond ] ) forces the concentration to be fixed at @xmath25 for @xmath75 , its values at @xmath47 are significantly smaller than @xmath25 ( see figure ( [ fig : densityprofiles ] ) , obtained for @xmath38 ) .",
    "discontinuity in @xmath14 , @xmath76 , is related to discontinuity in the flow velocity @xmath77 ( @xmath78 for @xmath24 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 ) .",
    "let @xmath81 denote the concentration at @xmath82 l.u .",
    "the rate of diffusive particle transfer per unit length through the interface @xmath23 is approximately equal to @xmath83 ( the factor 3 is the number of velocity directions in the lga model that transfer particles through the interface ) .",
    "this must be balanced by particle current caused by the fluid flow , which can be approximated by @xmath84 ( the factor 7 is the number of possible particle velocities ) .",
    "thus , @xmath85 , or @xmath86 comparison of this formula with the actual data obtained in simulations is shown in figure ( [ fig : dc - dv ] ) .",
    "the agreement is fairly good .",
    ", at the boundary @xmath23 as a function of the front velocity @xmath53 , obtained from simulations ( @xmath87 ) and equation ( [ eq : dc - dv ] ) ( solid line ) .",
    "[ fig : dc - dv ] , scaledwidth=65.0% ]",
    "several features of the model deserve closer attention .",
    "first , the model employs specular scatterers to mimic a porous medium as well as to reduce hydrodynamic effects  @xcite .",
    "however , the effect of such scatterers on the diffusion along the `` x '' axis is very peculiar : the `` x '' component of the momentum is changed only for those particles , whose velocity vector is parallel to the `` x '' axis . for this reason",
    "specular scatterers are widely used in lga models to implement slip - free walls parallel to the x axis . however , in the kl model the scatterers are distributed randomly with a relatively small concentration to form isolated , point - like islands .",
    "such scatterers are inefficient in breaking temporal correlations in the `` x '' component of momentum of particles that hit them .",
    "thus , on the one hand , randomly distributed specular scatterers have a very limited impact on the diffusivity along the `` x '' axis . on the other hand , the mean - free path , and hence the diffusion coefficient in the original",
    ", scatterer - free fhp model diverge to infinity as the reduced particle concentration goes to @xmath16 or @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "combination of these two effects explains the fundamental property of the kl model : extremely strong dependence of the diffusion coefficient on concentration @xcite .",
    "second , the present model is based on the fhp model , where particle - particle collisions preserve mass and momentum to mimic fluid flow .",
    "local conservation of momentum leads to hydrodynamic flow from high - pressure ( high - concentration ) to low - pressure ( low - concentration ) areas .",
    "therefore , hydrodynamical flow in any fhp - based model of porous media is inevitable and its effects should be always carefully taken into account , especially when specular scatterers are used to model a porous medium .",
    "third , assume that as soon as the flow velocity in the front becomes sufficiently small , the particle flux @xmath88 associated with it obeys darcy s law @xcite @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the permeability of the medium , @xmath91 denotes the fluid viscosity , and @xmath92 is the pressure gradient . taking into account that @xmath93 @xcite , @xmath94 ( stokes - einstein relation ) , and @xmath95 @xcite , one arrives at @xmath96",
    "if @xmath13 is very large , even a very small concentration gradient can cause a significant fluid flow .",
    "therefore , one can expect strong hydrodynamical effects to appear in _ any _ hydrodynamical model of porous medium with diffusion coefficient @xmath45 diverging to infinity at some value(s ) of @xmath14 .",
    "fourth , the value of @xmath97 in the similarity relation ( [ eq : scaling - moving ] ) turned out quite large . similarly , the relaxation time to the asymptotic , long - time regime in which the similarity holds , @xmath98 , is also large .",
    "these two effects may be related to the fact that in all fhp models @xmath48 , which constitutes the left - hand side of relation ( [ eq : vx_propto_c ] ) , is limited from above . however , the right - hand side of ( [ eq : vx_propto_c ] ) is a product of two quantities that at early stages of the front propagation assume very large values in the front region .",
    "thus , the system can obey darcy law only after a long relaxation time necessary to reduce the concentration gradient @xmath99 to a value of order @xmath100 .",
    "this explains why in the previous studies the front dynamics was found `` anomalous '' only if both @xmath25 was close to 1 and the specular scatterers were used @xcite .",
    "if any of these conditions was not satisfied , the value of diffusion coefficient @xmath13 took on relatively small values in the front region and the relaxation time was small enough to allow the simulations to reach the asymptotic regime .",
    "note also that large values of @xmath97 and @xmath98 are in accord with several recent experiments on sorptivity of building materials , where a short - time deviation from the @xmath101 behavior was found ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "fifth , the actual front velocity at early times turned out smaller than its value extrapolated from the long - time , `` darcy '' asymptotics ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : v - t ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath68 is negative and the front dynamics at early times appears `` superdiffusive '' ( @xmath41 ) . in systems where the early - time velocity is larger than the short - time extrapolation of the darcy asymptotics",
    ", @xmath68 would be positive and the early - time front dynamics would appear `` subdiffusive '' ( @xmath102 ) .    finally , figure [ fig : v - t ] suggests that at large times the mean front velocity , @xmath53 , becomes proportional to @xmath103 , which yields a characteristic length scale @xmath104 .",
    "this implies that the characteristic lengths associated to both diffusion and fluid flow asymptotically scale with time in the same way , as @xmath105 .",
    "consequently , the kl model is an example of a system where measurements based only on analysis of asymptotic concentration profiles can not differentiate between diffusive and hydrodynamic effects .",
    "we have shown that the unusual dynamics of the concentration front in the kl model of a porous medium can be fully explained as a combined effect of hydrodynamic flow and normal diffusion .",
    "our argumentation is not only simpler than that proposed by kntz and lavalle @xcite , who used the concept of anomalous diffusion , but also allows to explain more physical properties of the model , e.g.  a concentration drop at the boundary @xmath23",
    ".    from our analysis the following picture of the concentration front dynamics in the model emerges . a concentration gradient across the front leads to a pressure gradient which , in turn , forces the fhp fluid to flow . this flow is attenuated by scatterers that mimic a porous medium , so that hydrodynamical effects in most cases are negligible , especially at large times . however , randomly distributed specular scatterers used in the kl model are very inefficient at reduced concentrations close to 1 . in this particular case",
    "the viscosity goes to 0 , and both diffusivity and mobility along the `` x '' axis tend to infinity . under these conditions ,",
    "hydrodynamical flow significantly affects the front dynamics at all times . in particular",
    ", it renders the relaxation time to the asymptotic regime , where darcy law holds , very large , and significantly changes the position of the boltzmann - matano interface @xmath68 .",
    "the front dynamics is controlled by both diffusion and fluid flow , and at very large times the characteristic length scales of both processes become proportional to @xmath106 . consequently , at very large times the concentration profile can be expressed as a function of a single variable @xmath107 , which could easily be misinterpreted that the front dynamics is governed only by diffusion .    while the kl model can not be regarded as a model of anomalous diffusion , it remains an interesting model of fluid flow in a porous medium .",
    "its main advantage is ability to reproduce some non - trivial properties of concentration profiles found in several recent experiments .",
    "similarity between the model an experimental results suggests that the anomalous front behavior observed e.g. in experiments on building materials , may have nothing to do with anomalous diffusion , but is caused by some hydrodynamic effects that accompany normal diffusion .",
