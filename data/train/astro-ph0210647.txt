    "modelling eclipses in binary systems remains one of the most reliable tools for extracting stellar masses and radii . in the semi - detached systems , mass transfer via roche lobe overflow results in an orbital lightcurve that is often dominated by light from the accretion flow rather than the stellar components .",
    "if viewed from sufficiently large orbital inclinations , the shadow cast by the mass donor therefore slices not only across the accreting stellar object , but also probes the extended accretion flow around it .",
    "iy  uma   is a member of the cataclysmic variable ( cv ) subclass of dwarf novae , in which a white dwarf accretes from a late - type donor star in an unstable mass - transfer rate regime . during quiescence ,",
    "the accretion disc fills up until a global disc instability is triggered and the disc is emptied onto the primary white dwarf during semi - regular and short lived outbursts ( e.g. lasota 2000 ) .",
    "the white dwarf has no significant magnetic field in such systems , and the extended accretion disc is the dominant contributor to the optical light . in dwarf novae with short orbital periods , longer and more pronounced super - outbursts can occur in addition to normal outbursts . during such super - outbursts , the tidal torque of the mass donor star causes the large accretion disc to deform and precess , producing prominent light modulations ( the superhumps ) at a period slightly longer than the orbital period of the binary . although iy uma was already reported in 1997 to be a variable star ( takamizawa 1998 ) , its status was only established in january 2000 after a reported brightening .",
    "intensive monitoring of this object revealed a short - period dwarf nova in super - outburst featuring prominent superhumps as well as deep primary eclipses with an orbital period of 1.77 hours ( uemura et al .",
    "since then , several additional outbursts and super - outbursts have been reported , confirming that iy uma is one of the few eclipsing dwarf nova systems .",
    "patterson et al . (",
    "2000 ) presented extensive photometry during and after the january 2000 outburst and derived iy uma s system parameters using the well - defined eclipse features of the white dwarf and hot spot , while rolfe et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used the superhumps to trace the ellipsoidal shape of the accretion disc .",
    "we obtained high time - resolution photometry of iy uma using the s - cam2 superconducting tunnel junction device attached to the 4.2 m william herschel telescope on la palma ( rando et al .",
    "this cryogenic detector has both intrinsic energy sensitivity and high precision photon time - tagging , permitting rapid , low - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "it is thus ideally suited to the study of eclipse transitions in accreting binaries .",
    "it consists of a 6x6 array of tantalum superconducting tunnel junction ( stj ) devices , cooled to 0.3 k. the stj devices - hereafter pixels - have sizes of 25 x 25 @xmath7m@xmath8 , corresponding to @xmath9 0.6 x 0.6 arcsec@xmath8 .",
    "the field of view of the full array is @xmath9 4 x 4 arcsec@xmath8 , permitting good background subtraction when the seeing is nominal ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "the device has an energy resolving power of @xmath9 8.5 at 500 nm .",
    "photon energies are assigned to pulse - height analyser ( pha ) channels in the range 0 - 255 .",
    "the effective bandpass - determined by the glass optics , atmospheric absorption , ir filters and the detector s quantum efficiency - is around 340 to 680 nm , such that useful events fall between channels 60 - 165 .",
    "the relationship between channel number and photon energy is linear ( @xmath9 42.5 channels ev@xmath11 ) , but varies slightly from pixel to pixel .",
    "the arrival times of individual photons are logged with an accuracy of @xmath12 5 @xmath7s using gps timing signals .",
    "the data acquisition and reduction steps are described in section [ reduction ] , with a detailed analysis of the eclipses in section [ analysis ] followed by our conclusions .",
    ".table of observations [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our three accurate mid - eclipse times ( @xmath13 ) together with those listed in patterson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) were used to calculate a refined orbital ephemeris for iy uma ; @xmath14 all eclipse measurements were given equal weight in this ephemeris determination .",
    "the figures in brackets denote the error on the last digits .",
    "the above ephemeris is used throughout this paper whenever an orbital phase needs to be calculated . in order to ascertain the reliability of our white dwarf ingress / egress measurements as given in table [ timings ] , we calculated synthetic white dwarf lightcurves using a spherical white dwarf with given linear limb darkening coefficient .",
    "the limb of the roche lobe was evaluated using a three - point approximation ( e.g. wood & horne 1990 ) .",
    "white dwarf eclipse lightcurves were then calculated using variable limb darkening coefficients and ingress / egress phases were measured in the same manner as the data .",
    "we thus established that the individual phase measurements are reliable to within 4 seconds , with no measurable systematic offset .",
    "we then derived our final mean white dwarf ingress / egress duration of @xmath0 s based on 6 individual measurements .",
    "the total white dwarf eclipse duration is @xmath15 s , or 0.0637 in terms of phase .",
    "minimum light occurs @xmath16 seconds after white dwarf conjunction reflecting the distortion caused by the hot spot , while the curious rise in the eclipse after the end of white dwarf ingress reaches its peak @xmath17 seconds later .",
    "the duration of white dwarf ingress and egress are indistinguishable , indicating that the white dwarf is fully eclipsed before the rise of the short duration feature commences",
    ". we will look into this eclipse feature in more detail in section [ blibsec ] .",
    "we follow the techniques of wood et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and patterson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and use the measured hot spot ingress / egress phases as a constraint on the binary mass ratio @xmath18",
    ". predicted hot spot ingress and egress phases were calculated as a function of mass ratio using ballistic stream trajectories in the binary potential , assuming the secondary star is filling its roche lobe .",
    "the distance between white dwarf and the first lagrangian point is referred to as @xmath19 . using our three hot spot phases , we find that @xmath20 , while @xmath21 which corresponds to @xmath22 in terms of the binary separation @xmath23 .",
    "our derived mass ratio agrees with , and improves upon , the value derived by patterson et al .",
    "iy uma is one of the calibrators for patterson s empirical relation between the superhump period excess ( @xmath24 ) and the binary mass ratio ( patterson 2001 ) .",
    "we remark that our value for the mass ratio together with the observed period difference between orbital period and superhump period @xmath25 leads to @xmath26 based on iy uma alone if we assume a linear relation .",
    "interestingly , our inferred accretion disc size is significantly larger compared to the @xmath27 measured by patterson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and @xmath28 derived by stanichev et al .",
    "their observations took place 1 - 2 months before our data , and thus closer to the superoutburst that was first reported on january 13 , 2000 .",
    "we estimated the brightness of iy uma to be @xmath29 during our observations .",
    "this is brighter than the reported quiescent v magnitude of @xmath30 , which suggest that another outburst may have occured around the time of our observations . on the other hand ,",
    "the appearance of the light curve is very much like the quiescent lightcurves reported by patterson et al . which suggests that our observations would need to be during the later phases of such an outburst .",
    "given the faintess of iy uma , normal outbursts are easily missed by the variable star networks and it it thus no surprise that not all brightenings are reported .",
    "this is precisely the reason why iy uma , which reaches @xmath31 during super - outburst , was only recently discovered .",
    "the occurence of a normal outburst , rather than a super - outburst , in between our time of observations and that of patterson et al .",
    "( 2000 ) could explain the observed disc size . at the start of an outburst",
    ", the disc expands rapidly and then gradually shrinks back to its quiescent value .",
    "a large disc is thus a tell tale sign of enhanced mass accretion through the disc due to an outburst .",
    "having established the duration of white dwarf eclipse , we can then exploit the unique relation between @xmath32 , the binary inclination @xmath33 and the white dwarf eclipse duration @xmath4 and derive @xmath5 .",
    "finally , if we assume that the white dwarf radius is given by eggleton s mass - radius relationship ( verbunt & rappaport 1988 ) , we can use the measured white dwarf ingress / egress duration and determine the masses of the stellar components .",
    "we then find for the masses of the white dwarf and mass donor star in iy uma ; @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "these values are very similar to those of other short period systems such as z cha and ht cas , and as such typical for a short period cv with a mid to late m - type secondary star ( smith & dhillon 1998 ; rolfe , abbott & haswell 2002 ) .",
    "we remarked earlier that the end of white dwarf ingress is followed by a short ( @xmath36s ) rise in the lightcurve before the hot spot is eclipsed .",
    "this is surprising since more and more of the accretion flow is falling into the shadow of the secondary star which should result in a monotonically decreasing eclipse lightcurve . in order to understand the nature of this lightcurve feature",
    ", we illustrate its properties in more detail in figure [ blib ] .",
    "the feature is visible in all three observed eclipses and is always most pronounced in the blue band , and weakest in the red lightcurves .",
    "this suggests that the source responsible for this feature is compact and hot , with similar colours to the hot spot .",
    "its timing lies exactly between the end of white dwarf ingress ( @xmath37 ) and hot spot ingress ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "however , no similar feature is visible between white dwarf and hot spot egress , implying that the source of this additional light is not visible when observed from the opposite direction .",
    "this suggests that some feature rotates into view just after the white dwarf is eclipsed , while it is not visible at most other orbital phases . in order to facilitate the interpretation",
    ", we modeled the contribution of the white dwarf for each color band and subtracted its light from the orbital lightcurve .",
    "to wd flux was assumed to be constant before ingress and after egress and zero during white dwarf eclipse .",
    "the lightcurve was then completed by integrating the numerical derivative of the filtered lightcurve during white dwarf ingress and egress ( ala wood et al .",
    "1986 ) . in figure [ wdsub ]",
    ", we plot the mean white dwarf subtracted lightcurves for all colours .",
    "the rising feature reveals itself again most notably in the blue band , with an even higher blue - to - green ratio than the bright spot .",
    "its surface brightness needs to be larger than that of the hot inner disc regions since the count rate increases while the inner disc falls in the shadow of the secondary star .    to illustrate the geometry in iy uma near these orbital phases , we plot in figure [ geometry ] the roche geometry for the system parameters of iy uma .",
    "the inferred disc size is indicated by the solid circle , and the canonical location of the hot spot is the intersection of the ballistic gas stream trajectory with the disc edge .",
    "the path of the secondary star s shadow is also indicated as it advances between white dwarf ingress and hot spot ingress .",
    "a likely possibility is that the gas stream on impact buries itself ( partly ) into the disc , creating a narrow , hot impact cavity .",
    "if emission is beamed preferentially along the direction of the stream near impact rather than perpendicular to the disc edge , this buried part of the stream would then make a growing contribution to the lightcurve after white dwarf egress as the angle between the stream trajectory and the line of sight continues to decrease ( arrows in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] ) .",
    "the resulting rise in the lightcurve is cut short when the shadow of the secondary covers the stream impact region and the hot spot ingress takes place , explaining the short duration of the feature .",
    "this hot cavity along the stream trajectory is also consistent with its blue colour .",
    "since the cavity is buried in the disc , it would only be visible when the line of sight looks into the cavity , and not at opposite orbital phases .",
    "this qualitative model can thus explain all the observed features .",
    "no similar feature has been observed in other eclipsing cvs , but the very high binary inclination of iy uma may be a prerequisite for such line of sight effects to occur .",
    "the observable properties of this stream cavity effect depend mainly on how tightly and in what direction the light is beamed .",
    "the detailed geometry of the stream impact region is notoriously complex with possible other complications such as stream overflow and a vertically and azimuthally extended hot spot down - stream along the disc edge .",
    "our data suggest that the location of highest dissipation may not be at the disc edge , the classical location of the bright spot , but further into the disc . with more good quality high - speed observations of eclipsing cvs ,",
    "such models can be more thoroughly tested .",
    "we presented high - time resolution photometry of iy uma covering three of its deep eclipses .",
    "the data were obtained @xmath39 months after the january 2000 super - outburst using the s - cam2 stj - based detector array . using the well defined white - dwarf eclipse features , and our high time resolution , we derived an updated orbital ephemeris for this eclipsing dwarf nova system . in conjunction with measurements of the hot spot eclipse phases",
    ", we were able to derive accurate system parameters for iy uma .",
    "we found @xmath40 and @xmath41 , corresponding to a mass ratio of @xmath3 .",
    "the white dwarf eclipse width of @xmath4 then implies @xmath42 . the measured disc radius ( @xmath43 )",
    "was considerably larger than the values reported towards the end of the january 2000 super - outburst .",
    "this is most likely due to the occurence of a normal outburst just before our observations .",
    "the observed count - rates suggest that iy uma was slightly brighter than its nominal quiescent magnitude , supporting the occurence of a mass accretion rate increase .",
    "a curious short - lived rise in the orbital lightcurve was observed during all three eclipses .",
    "it occurs between the end of white dwarf ingress and hot spot ingress and has a blue colour .",
    "we suggested that the source of this light lies in the buried part of the gas stream , resulting in a compact , hot impact cavity .",
    "the curious line - of - sight effects leading to this lightcurve feature are the result of the very high binary inclination of iy uma , making it a wonderful system for exploring the complex geometry of the accretion flow in dwarf novae . given sufficient time resolution and signal to noise , lightcurve analysis of high inclination systems such as iy  uma   are thus an invaluable tool .",
    "the future looks bright with the energy resolution of stj devices significantly improving , and large - aperture telescopes providing sufficient photons to perform high - time resolution spectroscopy .",
    "ds is supported by a pparc fellowship .",
    "the william herschel telescope is operated on the island of la palma by the isaac newton group in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofisica de canarias ."
