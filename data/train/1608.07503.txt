    "is demonstrated by the observation of fractional quantized resistance values , akin to what was recently demonstrated in a conventional top split  gate architecture ( i.e.  a device in which the split ",
    "gate is placed on top of the graphene).@xcite owing to the different electrostatics of the device , though , lever arms values observed here for back and local gates are markedly different with respect to previous works.@xcite    the observed experimental behavior is described within the framework of the landauer - bttiker formalism by assuming the presence of three distinct filling factors : in the bulk of the sample ( @xmath2 ) , above the split  gate electrodes ( @xmath3 ) , and in the quantum - point - contact opening ( @xmath4 ) . in order to support the consistency of this interpretation and to provide a more general modeling framework , we present numerical calculations where the electrostatic potential landscape induced by the electrodes is directly obtained by solving the poisson equation , and no assumptions are made on local filling factors . in the quantum scattering problem , decoherence and equilibration are introduced in the present model only in regions where different edge modes co - propagate.@xcite numerical results reproduce the experimental data and confirm that transport in our devices is governed by currents flowing along the edges of regions with three distinct filling factors .",

    "hence , because of the reduced distance between the gates and the graphene , the gate voltages inducing a specific filling factor distribution are accordingly smaller .          when transport is fully coherent , no equilibration occurs between co - propagating edge modes and the model can not correctly reproduce the observed behavior ( see supplementary information ) . in order to induce partitioning of the current , dephasing bttiker virtual probes were introduced , as visible in fig .",

    "these are used as voltage probes , i.e. a zero net current flow is assumed at each of the probes .",
    "electrons entering the probe equilibrate in the reservoir , and emerge from it with a different phase .",
    "the choice of the positions of such artificial probes is crucial for edge - mode mixing .",
    "according to the theoretical models,@xcite equilibration in the bipolar junction takes place along the @xmath1@xmath0 interface , and in the case of a unipolar junction , shown in fig .",
    "[ geom](b ) , along the edge in the central , split  gate region . for the latter case ,",
    "the addition of voltage probes connected to the region over the split ",
    "gate results in resistance values that are in very good quantitative agreement with the values given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : unipolar2 ] ) . for the former case ,",
    "no configuration of the probes in the plane of the graphene nanoribbon gives values close to what is predicted by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bipolar1 ] ) or ( [ eq : bipolar2 ] ) . however , we obtained good results for the probes connected to the interior of the nanoribbon near the @xmath1@xmath0 junctions,@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ lat](b ) .",
    "the position and length of the probes is set so that most of the currents flowing along the junction can reach the probes .",
    "the final position and size of the probes is discussed in the following .",
    "two probes are armchair nanoribbons of 35 atoms width ( i.e.  they approximately have the same width as the leads ) connected to the region over the split  gate , and are assumed to be semi ",
    "infinite in the @xmath106 direction .",
    "further four probes are semi ",
    "infinite in the @xmath144 direction and attached to the ribbon in the vicinity of the split  gate , marked in orange in fig .",
    "[ lat](a ) and consisting of @xmath145 zigzag chains attached to the graphene plane within four areas marked schematically by black rectangles in fig .",
    "[ lat](a ) ( see supplementary material for further details ) .",
    "we calculate @xmath52 as a function of potentials @xmath15 and @xmath16 at the back  gate and split  gate , respectively ( see fig .  [ lat ] ) .",
    "the calculated resistance is presented in fig .",
    "[ scansym](a ) .",
    "the horizontal dashed lines indicate the transition between subsequent filling factors @xmath2 in the bulk of the nanoribbon , the vertical ones between filling factors @xmath3 in the split  gate , and the red dashed lines between filling factors @xmath4 in the middle of the qpc . following the nomenclature of ref .  , the plot is divided into sectors , depending on the relationship between the filling factors . in the sectors between",
    "dashed white lines labeled with i , where the filling factors have the same sign @xmath146 and @xmath147 , the device is in the edge state transmission regime . in the sectors",
    "labeled ii , partial equilibration occurs .",
    "as shown in section  [ discussion ] , in both aforementioned regimes , the device behaves like a unipolar junction with the resistance governed by @xmath4 . in the most unique case , in sectors",
    "iii , it is governed by the full equilibration process .",
    "whereas in sectors i and ii the resistance is independent of @xmath3 , in sector iii it depends on all three filling factors .",
    "this is nicely consistent with what was observed in the experimental data ( see fig .",
    "[ scan](a ) ) .",
    "the corresponding model values obtained with the landauer ",
    "bttiker formalism discussed in section  [ discussion ] are shown in the 2d plot in fig .",

    "there is a perfect agreement between the two plots in figs .",
    "[ scansym](a ) and [ scansym](b ) for region i , which would be the case even without any bttiker probes . in the edge state transmission regime ,",
    "no equilibration occurs , and only @xmath4 modes out of incoming @xmath2 modes can pass the split  gate , therefore no phase  randomizing is needed to obtain the expected resistance . in regime",
    "ii the resistance also coincides with the model values , as the high magnetic field used for the simulation forces all the incoming electrons to the side  probes , where they equilibrate . in sector iii , where equilibration occurs along the bg ",
    "sg interface , the agreement with the model data is good for @xmath44 , but the simulated values for @xmath149 exceed slightly the model ones .",
    "the reason is that the magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the ribbon does not push the electrons into the probes in @xmath144 , so that not all electrons enter the probes and a small fraction of electrons does not equilibrate . for @xmath44 ,",
    "for which the edge  state partitioning takes place at the point where the junction interface meets the edge , this does not yield a large deviation from the model resistance values .",
    "however , in the more complex case of @xmath149 , the random partitioning is expected to take place also between the sg and qpc regions , the effectiveness of which is somewhat smaller in the simulation .    in order to underline the excellent agreement between experiment , model , and simulation more thoroughly , we plot cross  sections of the longitudinal resistance . in figs .  [ cross](a ) and ( b ) cross  sections of the experimental data are plotted with orange and blue lines for the @xmath16 or @xmath15 values indicated by arrows of the same color in fig .  [ scan](a ) .",
    "the dashed line shows the value of resistance resulting from the model .",
    "the resistance reaches plateaus or at least gets close to the expected value for almost every set of @xmath150 in the cross  sections . a particularly good agreement for @xmath151  v",
    "is seen for the plateaus @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , i.e.  with @xmath155 . for the cross  section at @xmath156",
    "v , the resistance gets close to the model values @xmath87 , @xmath154 , and @xmath157 , but it does not reach the plateau @xmath158 for @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 , and the plateau @xmath154 for @xmath162 , @xmath163 , and @xmath161 . a too small resistance is obtained for almost every case in the partial equilibration regime .    in figs .  [ cross](c ) and",
    "( d ) , cross  sections of the simulated data are presented for @xmath16 indicated by arrows in fig .  [ scansym](a ) with the same color as the plot line .",
    "the agreement with the model is very good , and only in the case of three different filling factors in the full  equilibration regime , there is a small discrepancy . however , even in this case the curve follows the model line .",
    "the shape of the simulated and measured curves clearly is similar , one difference being the energies at which subsequent bands enter the transport , and the slope of the red dashed contours in fig .  [ scan ] , which gives rise to the occurrence of different sets of the three filling factors .",
    "we have analyzed the behavior of buried split ",
    "gate graphene devices which are suitable for scanning - probe - microscopy experiments . differently from studied experimental configurations ,  @xcite the measurements of the longitudinal resistance taken at @xmath164 indicated a screening of the back ",
    "gate by the split ",
    "gate within the qpc areas : this implies that no crosstalk between the two is observed .",
    "moreover , the measurements taken in the qh regime as well as the numerical simulation yield a resistance pattern indicating the clear presence of regions with three distinct filling factors .",
    "the resistance pattern can be explained with the mode equilibration of the edge currents that involves all three regions of varied filling factors and all modes participating in the current flow .",
