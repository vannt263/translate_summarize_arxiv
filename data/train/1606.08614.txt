    "they well describe the width dependence of the energies of both electron and hole subbands at @xmath2 and the energy dependence of the electron effective mass ( @xmath9 ) .",

    "the top of the valence band in the nominally symmetric structures with @xmath16 ( @xmath17  nm ) was found to be very strongly split by spin - orbit ( so ) interaction @xcite .",
    "therewith , the so splitting of the conduction band in the same structures does not reveal itself @xcite .",
    "it is surprising that such so splitting is observed in structures both with inverted and normal spectrum despite the fact that at @xmath18 and @xmath7 the conduction band is formed from different terms ( see fig .",

    "the conduction band is formed from electron states and states of light hole , while at @xmath7 , it is formed from heavy - hole states .",
    "such so splitting was not described by byckov - rashba effect taken into account within _ kp _ method .",
    "it was assumed @xcite that such a surprising behavior of so splitting is a result of the interface inversion asymmetry ( iia ) in the hgte quantum well , which was not taken into account in _ kp _ calculations in @xcite .",
    "the question arises : how other spin - dependent effects , for example , the zeeman splitting , depend on the spectrum type  normal or inverted .",

    "the simultaneous analysis of this dependence and the shape of oscillations of @xmath24 made it possible to determine both the ratio of the zeeman splitting to the cyclotron one and the anisotropy of @xmath0-factor ( @xmath25 ) over a wide electron - density range , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the in - plane and transverse @xmath0-factor , respectively .    .",

    "the samples were mesa etched into standard hall bars of @xmath31  mm width and the distance between the potential probes was @xmath31  mm . to change and control the carrier density in the quantum",

    "for each heterostructure , several samples were fabricated and studied .",
    "the zeeman splitting of the conduction band has been obtained from measurements of the sdh effect in a tilted magnetic field , i.e. we used the so - called coincidence method .",
    "this method is based on the fact that the spin splitting , @xmath32 , depends on the total magnetic field ( @xmath33 ) whereas the orbital splitting of the landau levels ( lls ) in 2d systems , @xmath34 , is proportional to the component of the magnetic field which is perpendicular to the 2d plane ( @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",

    "we have measured the oscillations at low magnetic field when :",
    "( i ) @xmath35 is significantly less than the field of the onset of the quantum hall effect ( qhe ) ; ( ii ) amplitude of the oscillation is small so that oscillations of the fermi energy are negligible ; ( iii ) the sdh oscillations are spin - unsplit . in this case , the study of the angular dependence of the oscillation amplitude @xmath47 at a given @xmath35 value within the entire range of angles ( rather than the determination of critical angles ) allows one not only to determine the ratio of the zeeman splitting to the orbital one , but estimate the @xmath0-factor anisotropy .    to find analytic expression for the tilt - angle dependence of the oscillation amplitude @xmath47 , it is convenient to represent the oscillations as the sum of the contributions from the two series of the landau spin sublevels . at low magnetic field ,",
