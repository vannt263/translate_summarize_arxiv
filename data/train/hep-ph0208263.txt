    "wncyb10 at 12.0pt    once upon a time the great russian physicist - theorist and mathematician bogoljubov said that the last line in the above written fragment from the book of proverbs which is a part of the bible ( non - canonical though ! )  ... ; but you did all arrange by measure , number and weight \" represents the definition of the physics @xcite . probably this   ... ; but you did all arrange by measure , number and weight \"  was an earliest evidence of the principle that all in the world have to be in harmony with each other .    in fact , the word harmony ( syn : music : accord , concord , consonance ) has the greek origin from @xmath0 which means orderliness ( symmetry ) of the whole , commensurability ( proportionality ) of its parts .",
    "the idea of harmony has intensively been elaborated by pythagoras , the greek philosopher and mathematician and founder of the pythagorean school @xcite .",
    "originally from samos , pythagoras founded a society which was at once a religious community and a scientific school flourished at kroton in southern italy about the year 530 b.c .",
    "pythagoras was the first genius of western culture .",
    "he had a multifaceted magnetic personality ",
    "an intelligent mathematician and a religious thinker , both co - existed in him .",
    "his main contributions are in geometry , numbers , music , cosmology , astronomy , philosophy and religion .",
    "pythagoras must have been one of the world s greatest men , but he wrote nothing though numerous works are attributed to him , and it is hard to say how much of the doctrine one knows as pythagorean is due to the founder of the society and how much is later development .",
    "it is also hard to say how much of what we are told about the life of pythagoras is trustworthy . for a mass of legend gathered around his name : sometimes he is represented as a man of science , and sometimes as a preacher of mystic doctrines , and we might be tempted to regard one or other of those characters as alone historical . certainly , it s true that there is no need to reject either of the traditional views .    even though many wonderful things related to pythagoras , belong to legend , and seem to have no historical foundation , similarly the description of the learned works which he wrote is not attested by reliable historians and also belongs to the region of fable , nevertheless it is no doubt however , that he founded a school , or , rather , a religious philosophical society , which exerted great influence on the intellectual development of human civilization and had a fundamental importance all the time . of great influence were the pythagorean doctrines that numbers were the basis of all things and possessed a mystic significance , in particular the idea that the cosmos is a mathematically ordered whole .",
    "aristotle wrote : ",
    "pythagorean having been brought up in the study of mathematics , thought that things could be represented by numbers ... and that the whole cosmos consists of a scale and a number \"",
    ". briefly stated , the doctrine of pythagoras was that all things are numbers .",
    "pythagoras was led to this conception by his discovery that the notes sounded by stringed instrument are related to the length of the strings .",
    "he conducted remarkable investigation in  music \" as he was a musician .",
    "harmonies correspond to most beautiful mathematical ratio , he stated .",
    "melodious musical tunes could be produced on a stringed instrument by plucking the string at particular points , which correspond to mathematical ratios .",
    "such beautiful mathematical ratios are @xmath1 ( an octave ) , @xmath2 ( a fifth ) , and @xmath3 ( a fourth ) .",
    "pythagoras recognized that first four numbers @xmath4 known as  tetractys \" , whose sum equals ten ( @xmath5 ) , contained all basic musical intervals : the octave , the fifth and the fourth .",
    "in fact , all the major consonances , that is , the octave , the fifth and the fourth are produced by vibrating strings whose lengths stand to one another in the ratios of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively .",
    "recent major scale in according to pythagoras tune looks like    @xmath6 where @xmath7 is major second ( fifth of fifth with octave lowering ) ; @xmath8 is major sixth ( fifth of major second ) ; @xmath9 is major third ( fifth of sixth with octave lowering ) ; @xmath10 is major seventh ( fifth of third ) .",
    "the resemblance which pythagoras perceived between the orderliness of music , as expressed in the ratios which he had discovered and the idea that cosmos is an orderly whole , made up of parts harmoniously related to one another , led him to conceive of the cosmos too as mathematically ordered .",
    "pythagoras compared the eight planets ( there were seven planets known the babylonians : moon , mercury , venus , sun , mars , jupiter and saturn ) , including the earth , with the musical octave and the seven planets , excluding the earth , as seven strings of the musical instrument lair .",
    "the planets situated at different distances and moving at different speed correspond to different notes on musical octave .",
    "the planets moving with higher speed produce higher notes and those with lower speed produce lower notes .",
    "the celestial harmony of moving planets produces heavenly music (  the music of the spheres \" ) analogous to different notes of musical octave .    according to pythagoras ,",
    "the sphere was the most beautiful solid and the circle the most beautiful shape .",
    "thus , a spherical planet moving in circular orbit would form a harmonious constellation .",
    "pythagoras worked out the distances of the planets from the earth .",
    "he arranged the planets in order of increasing distances of the planets from the earth .",
    "the order given by him was the moon , mercury , venus , the sun , mars , jupiter and saturn .",
    "some pythagoreans believed that the earth moved round a central fire .",
    "the earth did not always face the central fire .",
    "this accounted for day and night on the earth .",
    "they also believed that the moon as well as the sun shone because they reflected light from their surfaces received from the central fire .",
    "perhaps the idea of central fire later on led to the heliocentric ( sun at the centre of the solar system ) configuration of solar system .",
    "pythagoras observation of heavens suggested to him that the motion of the heavenly bodies was cyclic and that the heavenly bodies returned to the place from which they had started . from this",
    ", pythagoras concluded that there must be a cycle of cycles , a greater year and on its completion the heavenly bodies returned to the original position and the same heavenly constellation would be observed again and again .",
    "he called this the eternal recurrence .",
    "pythagoras doctrine that mathematics contains the key to all philosophical knowledge , an idea , which was by his followers afterwards developed into an elegant number - theory .",
    "the pythagorean philosophy in its later elaboration is dominated by the number - theory .",
    "being the first , apparently , to observe that natural phenomena , especially the phenomena of the astronomical world , may be expressed in mathematical formulas , the pythagoreans held that numbers are not only the symbols of reality , but the very substance of real things .",
    "pythagoras associated numbers with geometrical notions and numerical ratios with shapes .",
    "he associated number one with a point , too with a line , three with a triangle ( the surface ) and four with a tetrahedron ( the solid ) .",
    "thus , one point generates dimensions , two points generate a line of one dimension , three points generate a surface of two dimensions , and four points generate three - dimensional solid figures . in geometry , numbers represent lengths , their squares represent areas , their cubes represent volumes . starting from numbers , numerical ratios and their powers , one can construct geometrical figures of different shapes and geometrical solids of different sizes . using distance the arrangement of planets , their motion",
    ", their orbital path , their distances from the center and their interrelations with each other can be worked out .",
    "thus , according to pythagoras all relations could be reduced to number relations and hence , the whole cosmos is a scale and a number based phenomenon .    according to pythagoras ,",
    "ten is the perfect number , because it is the sum of one , two , three , and four  the point , the line , the surface , and the solid .",
    "there are the second type of perfect numbers : according to pythagoras the second type of perfect numbers are those were the numbers equal to sum of their factors .",
    "for instance 28 has factors 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 14 and @xmath11 .    from perfect numbers ,",
    "pythagoras was led to amicable numbers like 220 and 284 .",
    "amicable numbers form a pair of numbers where each number is equal to the sum of the factors of the other numbers .",
    "for instance 220 has factors 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 10 , 11 , 20 , 22 , 44 , 55 , 110 .",
    "the sum of these factors is @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , 284 has factors 1 , 2 , 4 , 71 , 142 .",
    "the sum of these factors is @xmath13 .",
    "triangular numbers have been introduced by pythagoras : pythagoras called numbers 1 , 3 , 6 , 10 , 15 , 21 , 28 , 36 , 45 , 55 , 66 as triangular numbers because these numbers can be arranged so as to form triangles .",
    "if @xmath14 are sides of a right - angled triangle and @xmath15 is the hypotenuse then according to pythagoras theorem @xmath16 .",
    "the triad of positive integers @xmath17 satisfying the relation @xmath18 is called the pythagorean triad of numbers .",
    "about fifteen such triads were previously known like ( 3,4,5 ) , ( 5,12,13 ) , ( 7,24,25 ) , ( 9,12,15 ) , ( 15,36,39 ) .",
    "the pythagorean triads in which the numbers @xmath19 do not have a common factor are called primitive pythagorean triads . for example",
    "( 3,4,5 ) , ( 5,12,13 ) , ( 7,24,25 ) etc .",
    "are primitive pythagorean triads . but",
    "( 9,12,15 ) , ( 15,36,39 ) are not primitive triads .",
    "it is believed that pythagoras himself discovered the formula for determining triads of numbers satisfying the relation @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , all pythagorean triads can be expressed via formulae a = m^2-n^2,b=2mn , c = m^2+n^2,[triad ] where @xmath20 are any positive integers @xmath21 .    from his observations in music , mathematics and astronomy",
    ", pythagoras generalized that everything could be expressed in terms of numbers and numerical ratios .",
    "numbers are not only symbols of reality , but also substances of real things .",
    "hence , he claimed - all is number .",
    "the importance of this conception is very great , for example , it is the ultimate source of galileo s belief _  il libro della natura  scritto in lingua matematica \" _ that the book of nature is written in mathematical symbols and hence the ultimate source of modern physics in the form in which it came to us from galileo .",
    "it may be taken as certain that the union of mathematical genius and mysticism is common enough .",
    "pythagoras himself discovered the numerical ratios which determine the concordant intervals of the musical scale .",
    "similar to musical intervals , in medicine there are opposites , such as the hot and the cold , the wet and the dry , and it is the business of the physician to produce a proper  blend \" of these in the human body .",
    "the pythagoreans contended that the opposites are found everywhere in nature , and the union of them constitutes the harmony of the real world .",
    "they also argued for the notion that virtue is a harmony , and may be cultivated not only by contemplation and meditation but also by the practice of gymnastics and music .",
    "pythagoras held the theory that what gives form to the unlimited is the limit .",
    "that is the great contribution of pythagoras to philosophy , and we must try to understand it .",
    "it was natural for pythagoras to look for something of the same kind in the world at large .",
    "musical tuning and health are alike means arising from the application of limit to the unlimited .    in their psychology and their ethics",
    "the pythagoreans used the idea of harmony and the notion of number as the explanation of the mind and its states , and also of virtue and its various kinds .",
    "pythagoras argued that there are three kinds of men , just as there are three classes of strangers who come to the olympic games .",
    "the lowest consists of those who come to buy and sell , and next above them are those who come to compete .",
    "best of all are those who simply come to look on .",
    "men may be classified accordingly as lovers of wisdom , lovers of honour , and lovers of gain .",
    "that seems to imply the doctrine of the tripartite soul , which is also attributed to the early pythagoreans on good authority .",
    "the pythagoreans were religiously and ethically inclined , and strove to bring philosophy into relation with life as well as with knowledge .",
    "the pythagoreans believed also in reincarnation or transmigration ( doctrine of rebirth ) , that is , the soul , after death , passes into another living thing , which presupposes the ability of the soul to survive the death of the body , and hence some sort of belief in its immortality .",
    "the above detailed introduction is made so as to show in the next sections that the great ancient pythagorean ideas have found themselves in the latest researches in high energy elementary particle and nuclear physics . in this respect",
    "we will concern and discuss the mathematical , physical and geometrical aspects of the famous froissart theorem and in this way we will easily establish a link of this theorem to the mathematics and ideas elaborated in the pythagorean school . in other words , we would like to show a harmony of the froissart theorem just in the pythagoreans sense .",
    "in the year 1961 french physicist marcel froissart discovered and proved a remarkable theorem , which stated that two - body reaction @xmath22 amplitude , satisfying mandelstam representation , is bounded by expressions of the form @xmath23 at the forward and backward angles , and @xmath24 at any fixed angle in the physical region , @xmath25 being a constant , @xmath26 being the total squared c.m .",
    "energy ( one of the mandelstam invariant variables @xmath27 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the total cross sections increasing at most like @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "a little bit later it was shown that the analytical properties of two - particle scattering amplitude , which may be established strictly in the framework of axiomatic quantum field theory , bring us to the froissart statements as well . up - to - date derivation of the froissart theorem can be realized in a few steps , and we briefly sketch out it here .    for simplicity we consider a reaction of elastic scattering @xmath29 for two scalar particles .",
    "the scattering amplitude of the two - body reaction may be considered as a function of the invariant variable @xmath30 and two unit vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 on two - dimensional sphere @xmath33 , which characterise the initial and final states of two - particle system : @xmath34 , @xmath35 is c.m .",

    "was shown @xcite that the hypothesis about validity of the dispersion relations in the momentum transfer leads , for any value of the energy @xmath26 , to a potential which is a superposition of yukawa potentials with energy dependent intensities .",
    "this fact together with a theorem on single - time reduction in quantum field theory @xcite provides a strong basis for semiclassical consideration given by froissart .",
    "however , it should be stressed that upper bound ( [ 17 ] ) has a quite different geometrical sense compared to semiclassical consideration given by froissart : eq .",

    "in this minireview we have tried in the spirit of the pythagorean school to show the mathematical , physical and geometrical beauty of the froissart theorem .",

    "we found a very simple relations between physically tangible quantities which looked like pythagoras harmonic ratios mentioned above and hence might be considered as a  hadronic symphony \" in the fundamental dynamics .",

    "it appears that the study of fundamental processes in high energy elementary particle physics makes it possible to establish a missing link between cosmos and microcosmos , between the great ancient ideas and recent investigations in particle and nuclear physics and to confirm the unity of physical picture of the world .",
