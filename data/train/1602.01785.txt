    "recently , there has been interest in vortex dynamics in nanoscale systems , in particular , in manipulating individual vortices , which may enable experiments quantifying fundamental properties of abrikosov vortices such as the vortex mass@xcite and forces influencing vortex motion@xcite ( e.g. , damping , pinning , boundary , and magnus ) .",
    "novel superconducting devices exploiting both the classical@xcite and quantum@xcite motion of individual abrikosov vortices were proposed .",
    "the manipulation of individual vortices within doubly - connected superconducting nanoloops was reported recently@xcite . in that system",
    ", vortex motion is detected through its influence on the periodic magnetoresistance oscillations . in this article",
    ", we explore the influence of vortices on the magnetoresistance of singly - connected nanowires . in the one - dimensional limit",
    ", the resistance of a superconductor is controlled by the rate of phase slips ",
    "@xmath2 jumps of the phase of the superconducting order parameter@xcite .",
    "the rate of phase slip events is determined by either thermal activation over@xcite or , in the low - temperature limit , quantum tunneling through@xcite an energy barrier , leading to an exponentially small resistance below the critical temperature , @xmath3 . in 2d narrow strips , instead of the magnitude of the order parameter fluctuating to zero at a single point and allowing for a phase `` unwinding , '' an abrikosov vortex can nucleate at a sample boundary , cross the strip , and exit the opposite side@xcite , carrying with it a @xmath2 phase slip .",
    "the voltage induced by phase slips is given by the josephson relation , @xmath4@xcite .",
    "as in the 1d case , the phase slip rate , and therefore the induced voltage drop , is also determined by a corresponding energy barrier .    for a spatially isolated single vortex crossing event , this energy barrier can be calculated in the london approximation@xcite .",
    "a major advantage of the london approximation is its validity over a wide range of temperatures , unlike the ginzburg - landau theory , which is formally restricted to temperatures very near @xmath3 .",
    "anticipating that potential quantum applications of vortex manipulation will necessarily be performed at temperatures far below @xmath3 , we chose to investigate the magnetoresistance signatures of vortex dynamics in an experimental system far from @xmath3 ; we therefore interpret our observations in accordance with the london formalism . as we show below , in certain field ranges , the energy barrier determining the vortex crossing rate varies non - monotonically , giving rise to non - monotonic magnetoresistance variations in the nanowire .",
    "these magnetoresistance variations are distinct from the critical current oscillations observed in nanowires of disordered aluminum@xcite and _ a_:ino@xcite , which are due to the formation of a `` webber blockade''@xcite , wherein static vortices are added to a nanowire one at a time in analogy to the coulomb blockade in quantum dots@xcite .",
    "the london approximation has some established limitations ; most notably , it neglects the energy contributions arising from the finite extent of the vortex core and is restricted to systems without large gradients in field or cooper pair density . in systems with a short coherence length , @xmath5 , and large penetration depth , @xmath6 , ( i.e. , strongly type - ii systems ) , these limitations are overcome . to address the intermediate regime ( @xmath7 ) ,",
    "previous authors have investigated the magnetoresistance of superconducting nanowires utilizing a time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) phenomenology@xcite .",
    "the ginzburg - landau approach allows for treatment of systems where spatial variations in the order parameter are significant , such as is the case with a high density of vortices .",
    "while the tdgl equations are only rigorously justified in the case of a gapless superconductor@xcite , the results obtained are often in qualitative agreement with experimental observations . for the 2d crystal nanowire discussed in this article",
    ", we show below that the london approach predicts the same influence of vortex dynamics on the magnetoresistance as the tdgl approach  namely , that crossing abrikosov vortices generate a non - monotonic magnetoresistance signature in nanowires .",
    "below , we present magnetoresistance measurements on long superconducting nanowires of 2d crystal nbse@xmath0 .",
    "the nanowires have a width of @xmath8 , which is narrow enough that the vortex crossing mechanism is expected to dominate the magnetoresistance through the generation of phase slips@xcite , but wide enough to also allow for the trapping and pinning of vortices within the strip@xcite .",
    "the nanowires have a length of @xmath9 , placing them in a regime where spatial variations in the crossing barrier along the length of the nanowire affect the magnetoresistance signature . in this regime",
    ", we observe aperiodic mangetoresistance variations arising from vortex crossing events , in agreement with theoretical calculations in the london approximation ( see section  [ theory ] ) . above a critical magnetic field ,",
    "the presence of geometrically trapped and weakly pinned vortices locally modifies the barrier for vortex crossing and the resulting magnetoresistance variations . in this way , the magnetoresistance variations provide a `` magneto fingerprint '' that serves as a map of the sample - specific pinning potential . by intentionally modifying the pinning potential through the addition of surface adsorbates , we change the magnetoresistance response of the nanowire .",
    "the stability of a single abrikosov vortex within a 2d nanowire has been considered theoretically on many occasions@xcite .",
    "the london equation governing the local magnetic field , @xmath10 , inside a thin film containing a single vortex at position @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the current density and @xmath14 is the magnetic flux quantum .",

    "we will return to a discussion of this situation in sections  [ variations ] and [ pinning ] .",

    "the vortex energy does not depend upon its position along the nanowire length , as the system is considered to be uniform in that direction . but experimental devices always feature inhomogeneities , so there will be some preferential location for vortex trapping due to local variations in the nanowire width and location of defect sites .",
    "above @xmath1 , vortices will first become trapped at these preferential sites .",

    "<S> nanowires of two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystals of type - ii superconductor nbse@xmath0 prepared by electron - beam lithography were studied , focusing on the effect of the motion of abrikosov vortices . </S>",
    "<S> we present magnetoresistance measurements on these nanowires and show features related to vortex crossing , trapping , and pinning . </S>",
    "<S> the vortex crossing rate was found to vary non - monotonically with the applied field , which results in non - monotonic magnetoresistance variations in agreement with theoretical calculations in the london approximation . above the lower critical field , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 , the crossing rate is also influenced by vortices trapped by sample boundaries or pinning centers , leading to sample - specific magnetoresistance patterns . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the local pinning potential can be modified by intentionally introducing surface adsorbates , making the magnetoresistance pattern a `` magneto fingerprint '' of the sample - specific configuration of vortex pinning centers in a 2d crystal superconducting nanowire . </S>"
