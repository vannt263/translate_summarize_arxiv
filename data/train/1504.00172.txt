    "last decade was quite fruitful in the field of heavy baryon spectroscopy . at present , all baryons containing heavy charm and bottom quarks , except @xmath1 baryon , as well as several heavy baryons with negative parity , have been observed by a number of collaborations ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "these progresses stimulated further theoretical studies , and experimental researches on heavy baryons at the existing facilities , especially at lhc .",
    "heavy baryons are well recognized to represent a rich  laboratory \" for theoretical investigations .",
    "the properties of heavy baryons have been studied in framework of the various methods such as , relativistic quark model @xcite , variational approach @xcite , constituent quark model @xcite , lattice qcd model @xcite , qcd sum rules method @xcite .",

    "one of the most crucial quantities in discovering the internal structure of the baryons is their magnetic moments .",
