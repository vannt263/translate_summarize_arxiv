    "these transients called `` eit waves '' ( or `` euv waves '' ) are registered by a number of euv telescopes  eit , trace , stereo / euvi , sdo / aia , _ etc . _ ( see ; ; for a review ) .",
    "analysis of observations and interpretation of such phenomena meet problems .",
    "glaring flare emission hampers detection of faint euv waves .",
    "many data are limited by 12-min imaging rate of eit .",
    "faster trace observations @xcite have a small field of view .",
    "it is often difficult to reliably identify and trace a moving feature of interest . to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "special methods are employed , but they might contribute artifacts .",
    "multi - instrument analyses sometimes encounter timing problems .",
    "thus , some results used in interpretation and modeling might not be completely adequate to the observed phenomena .",
    "the nature of euv waves has been debated starting from their discovery @xcite .",
    "the most popular interpretations of a near - surface euv wave are _ i _ )  traces of an mhd fast - mode wave in the lower corona ( _ e.g. _ , ; @xcite @xcite ; ; ) and _ ii _ )  plasma compression in bases of coronal loops in their successive stretching by an expanding cme ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "a numerical 2d mhd simulation of a magnetic flux rope eruption @xcite revealed both the ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) disturbances .",
    "presented the first 3d mhd modeling of an `` eit wave '' as a disturbance produced by an eruption - driven shock wave .",
    "a fast - mode wave detected in the simulation corresponded to an euv wave observed in the modeled event including reflection from a coronal hole in support of the wave hypothesis .",
    "none of existing models describes all properties of euv waves .",
    "most likely , this is because the multitude of transients observed as euv waves actually correspond to different phenomena .",
    "this conjecture is supported by a variety of morphologic and dynamic characteristics of observed euv waves .",
    "for example , 1 )  their velocities estimated from observations of some events exceeded the coronal fast - mode speed , whereas they were lower in other events @xcite ; 2 )  the wave front can be either diffuse or sharp ; 3 )  kinematics of an euv wave can be incompatible with the fast - mode mhd wave model @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , such properties of euv waves as deceleration , decay , and broadening the disturbance ( @xcite @xcite ; ; ) , bypassing regions of an increased alfv ' en velocity  coronal holes and active regions @xcite , possible reflections @xcite appear to correspond to the hypothesis of a coronal mhd wave .",
    "considerations of wave - like transients sometimes observed in euv to expand above the limb also suggest that different phenomena might be involved ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ; @xcite , @xcite ; ; ; ; ) .",
    "in paper  iii @xcite we consider an event with a two - component `` eit wave '' ; a propagating component matched properties of a coronal shock wave , while a stationary component was presumably associated with a stretched cme structure .",
    "if some euv waves are really due to coronal shock waves , then their correspondence with signatures of shocks in higher corona is expected .",
    "type ii radio bursts are considered as manifestations of shock waves propagating upwards in the corona ( _ e.g. _ , ) . concluded that almost all metric type ii bursts were accompanied by euv waves but stated no correlation between their speeds ; on average , the speeds of euv waves were three times less than estimates from drift rates of type ii bursts . found that many euv waves were not associated with type ii bursts .    proposed that kinks or deflections of coronal rays at the flanks and rear ends of fast cmes could be signatures of shock waves .",
    "an important common property of these flank / rear kinks was their deceleration , while the authors did not reveal deceleration of cme leading edges .",
    "a usually considered scenario for the formation of shock waves , which might show up in lasco images , seems to be incompatible with wave signatures on the solar surface . in this scenario ,",
    "when the cme speed exceeds the local fast - mode speed at heliocentric distances @xmath1 , a bow shock forms continuously pressed by a fast cme . however , a bow shock followed by a mach cone can only be formed by a supersonic body of a fixed size , whereas cmes expand omnidirectionally ( with respect to their center ) . hence , the conic bow shock geometry appears to be unlikely for wide cmes .",
    "since neither mechanisms nor heights of the shock formation have been established , possible association between surface euv waves and cme components can not be excluded .",
    "indeed , found the upper part of an expanding euv dome to coincide with a white - light cme , while the lower skirt of the dome was a surface euv wave .",
    "for these reasons it is difficult to expect that all observed properties of euv waves could be explained by a single mechanism .",
    "based on this assumption , our three companion papers are focused on those euv waves , which are most likely associated with coronal shock waves .",
    "we address a few events , all of which were previously studied .",
    "even for a rather uniform subset of phenomena probably corresponding to similar processes , seemingly contradictions between some observational facts might occur .",
    "we endeavor to reconcile such discrepancies .",
    "one of challenging issues is reconciliation of euv wave velocities and drift rates of type ii bursts .",
    "this is a subject of the present paper i , the first one of the three companion papers .",
    "assuming the shock wave nature of euv waves under consideration , we try to settle disagreement between different studies .",
    "in this paper we use a simplest approximation of a self - similar shock wave that is convenient in comparisons with observations , which often show self - similarity of the wave front expansion .",
    "however , this approximation corresponds to the strong shock wave limit and can not apply to all stages of events .",
    "a weaker shock seems to be more realistic , but its calculations are more complex",
    ". propagation of a weak shock along the solar surface is analytically modeled in paper  ii @xcite .",
    "paper  iii analyzes propagation of a probable shock wave in the 17 january 2010 event using both strong and weak shock approximations .",
    "excitation of shock waves in eruptive events seems to be undoubted , but their sources have not been established .",
    "three possible exciters of shock waves are considered : _ i _ )  a pressure pulse produced by a flare , _ ii _ )  a super - alfv ' enic piston , and _",
    "iii _ )  an impulsive piston . in case",
    ", a bow shock continuously driven by a supersonic cme is expected to appear with kinematics determined by the driver . in case",
    "( _ i _ ) or ( _ iii _ ) , the shock wave expelled by an impulsive driver propagates afterwards freely like a decelerating blast wave ( _ cf . _ ) .",
    "observations suggest that shock waves excited by impulsive drivers and freely propagating in the low corona do exist .",
    "this is indicated by deceleration of moreton / euv waves ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite @xcite ) , differences between propagation directions of the wave and a possible driver @xcite , very early appearance of type ii bursts .",
    "we accept this possibility as a working hypothesis and use a description of propagation of a blast shock wave .",
    "it is possible to calculate it analytically for two limits .",
    "one limit is a strong self - similar wave , whose length along a propagation direction is comparable with the curvature radius of the wave front . the opposite limit is a weak shock wave , whose length is much less than the curvature radius of the front and a typical size of inhomogeneities in the medium",
    ". found that a formal usage of expressions for propagation of a strong self - similar shock wave excited by a point - like explosion in a gas allowed to fit the speeds and positions of a moreton wave as well as an euv wave at the initial stage of the motion .      used a simple model to describe propagation of such a blast - like wave in plasma with a radial power - law ( pl ) density falloff @xmath2 from an eruption center , @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the distance and @xmath5 the density at a distance of @xmath6 .",
    "we use @xmath7 mm , close to the scale height .",
    "( _ our notations are different from those used in the papers listed above _ ) .",
    "self - similarity of a shock wave is ensured by a presumable large pressure excess inside the volume confined by the shock front over a non - disturbed medium .",
    "propagation of a shock wave in the self - similar approximation is determined by plasma density distribution being almost insensitive to the magnetic fields .",
    "such a wave decelerates when @xmath8 due to a growing mass of swept - up material .",
    "propagation of a strong shock vs. time @xmath9 in plasma with a pl density model is described by an expression @xmath10 the approximation has a singularity at @xmath11 ( here also the wave velocity @xmath12 ) ; however , wave signatures are not observed at small distances .",
    "the approximation becomes inaccurate at large distances , being not limited from below by the fast - mode speed .",
    "a wave traveling along the solar surface weakens at large distances and propagates , in the first approximation , in a flat - layered atmosphere .",
    "expression ( [ e - wave_prop ] ) describes strong spherical shock waves , which seem to be unrealistic in solar conditions , but its usage within some range of distances can be justified .",

    "2 )  the self - similar solution of a strong wave satisfactorily describes damping of a gas - dynamic shock wave up to mach numbers @xmath13 , when the wave is neither strong nor weak .",
    "3 )  applicability of gas - dynamic self - similar solutions to mhd blast shock waves is not obvious , because account of the magnetic field seems to be necessary .",
    "we note the following . with @xmath14 ,",
    "the gas pressure behind the shock front exceeds the magnetic pressure , even if @xmath15 in non - disturbed plasma before the shock front ; here @xmath16 is a ratio of the shock speed to the fast - mode speed before the front , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the sound and alfv ' en speeds .",
    "that is , the plasma flow behind the shock front has a gas - dynamic character .",
    "the role of magnetic fields is also not crucial for medium - intensity shocks ( @xmath19 ) , which also strongly heat plasma , thus significantly increasing its pressure .",
    "for example , with @xmath20 , the plasma pressure behind the front of a wave perpendicular to the magnetic field is equal to the magnetic pressure before the front , even if @xmath21 there . for a switch - on shock wave running along the magnetic field",
    "this occurs with a mach number @xmath22 .",
    "expression ( [ e - wave_prop ] ) was obtained under an assumption that the @xmath2 index was independent of the wave propagation direction @xmath23 .",
    "we will formally use this expression also when @xmath24 , if variations of @xmath2 are small with the change of the direction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath25 .",
    "note that in a limit of a weak , short shock wave , its propagation is determined by a local value of @xmath2 even if this condition is not satisfied .",
    "the above considerations lead to a heuristic conclusion about a possibility to use expression ( [ e - wave_prop ] ) for approximate estimates of kinematic characteristics of shock waves of intermediate intensity propagating in medium with @xmath24 .",

    "the last measured point hints at a possible later deceleration . the transition from the initial zero speed to a final",
    "one occurred between two samples .",
    "hence , the maximum acceleration of the loop could well exceed 10  km  s@xmath64 .",
    "all components of the corresponding cme decelerated ( ) , so that the eruption resembled an explosion with a strong impulsive acceleration followed by continuous decreasing deceleration .",
    "figure  [ f-20040713_kinematics]c also shows the plasma pressure computed from sxr goes fluxes and a source size of 15  mm found from rhessi @xcite images .",

    "this fact suggests that the eruptive filament accelerated almost independently of the flare reconnection rate and hxr emission , at least , in this event .",
    "there are two options regarding a relation between the bright feature and the loop .",
    "one possibility is that @xmath69 minutes after the start of the acceleration of the bright feature , the loop suddenly and independently underwent much higher impulsive acceleration .",

    "the shock speed @xmath71 at the onset of the loop motion can be roughly estimated from a pl fit @xcite to be about 1000  km  s@xmath68 , but it is rather uncertain because of insufficient temporal coverage by trace images and their long exposure times . the fast - mode speed can be estimated from an expression @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is a coefficient determining the steepening rate of the wave front .",

    "we extrapolated coronal magnetic fields from a soho / mdi magnetogram using a package of based on a potential approximation @xcite .",

    "the shock front hit the loop almost horizontally , and the estimated mach number is related to the horizontal direction , while in the vertical direction the shock was probably stronger .    thus , the loop itself was most likely passive , and its motion was driven by the shock wave .",

    "the loop therefore is unlikely to have excited the second shock wave , as phs hypothesized .",
    "could not find out from kinematics if the leading edge of a coronal transient observed by lasco ( see figure  [ f-20040713-eit_lasco]b ) was a mass ejection or a trace of a wave .",

    "thus , a slower motion of the main body of a cme well behind a shock front does not guarantee that the cme or its components were not implicated in excitation of the shock .",
    "the maximum plane - of - sky speeds of the eruptions in events 13 appear to be well below the alfv ' en speed expected at moderate heights ( @xmath122 mm ) above active regions ( _ e.g. _ , ) , where the waves appeared .",
    "it is possible that the angles between the velocity vectors and the line of sight significantly differed from @xmath123 , so that the real velocities could be higher , but the corresponding corrections are insufficient to increase the velocities above the alfv ' en speed .",

    "accelerations and their durations before the wave onsets were ( section  [ s - observations ] ) : 4  km  s@xmath64 and 90  s in event 1 ; 7  km  s@xmath64 and 70  s in event 2 ; @xmath130  km  s@xmath64 and 800  s in event 3 . the stronger acceleration , the faster a shock appeared .",
    "the shock waves in the four events were most likely excited by eruptive structures as impulsive pistons , which one might call the appearing cmes .",
    "then the waves rapidly steepened into shocks , detached the pistons , and freely propagated afterwards like blast waves .",
    "the shock excitation mechanism implies a source height to be nonzero , but rather low , probably @xmath122  mm , as suggested by all dynamic spectra and implied by event  4 .",
    "@xcite ( @xcite ) found the heights of sources of metric type ii bursts to be between 70 and 280  mm ; however , the apparent heights of limb sources in the metric range could be noticeably reduced due to refraction ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ) .",
    "the shock character of the waves is supported by the correspondence of their kinematics to the expected propagation of shock waves as well as the drift rates of type ii bursts and drifting continua .",
    "the shock - wave nature of euv waves is supported with probable reflections and coupling of two shock waves in event 3 .",
    "expansion of leading edges of cmes produced in three events corresponded to propagation of the lower skirts of the shock fronts observed as moreton / euv waves .",
    "thus , the wave excitation by an impulsive piston appears to match all the considered observations , basically corresponding to a picture proposed by .",
    "so far we did not relate a piston with a particular structure or its surface .",
    "presumable pistons could be either an eruptive filament ( ef ) or a cme frontal structure ( fs ) .",
    "both expand as an entire ensemble in a completely formed cme ; only its outer sheath can be a piston .",
    "this sheath is believed to be both the surface of contact discontinuity and the outer fs surface .",
    "expansion of such an fs - piston determines propagation of an interplanetary piston - driven wave and the drag force affecting a cme .",
    "the situation is different during the early cme formation inside an active region , when ef moves faster than it would be adequate for a self - similar expansion of the whole cme .",
    "the ef acts here as an impulsive piston and excites inside a future cme a wave , which freely propagates outwards as a shock wave . in the four events we revealed just this excitation scenario of waves , which resembled blast ones . propagating upwards ,",
    "such a wave inevitably would pass through the fs and appear ahead of it .",
    "expansion of a magnetoplasma cme s constituent is different from kinematics of a wave traced , _",
    "e.g. _ , with a leading edge of a plasma flow driven by a shock .",
    "the cme expansion is known to be about self - similar at moderate distances from the sun .",
    "_ the self - similar approach does not apply to early stages of expansion , when the structure and shape of a cme have not yet been established .",
    "_ when an instability driving an eruption completes and drag of the solar wind is not yet significant , the self - similar cme kinematics can be obtained from considerations of forces affecting a cme @xcite .",
    "expansion of magnetoplasma structures is governed by magnetic forces , plasma pressure , and gravity as long as the effect of the solar wind is small . with the polytropic index @xmath131 all the forces integrated over the boundary and volume of a cme scale with distance @xmath27 by the same factor of @xmath132 .",
    "this leads to an expression for the cme velocity @xmath133 , @xmath134 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath135 is the initial size of self - similar expansion , @xmath136 the initial velocity at @xmath135 , and @xmath137 the asymptotic velocity in infinity . at large distances acceleration @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the expression for the cme velocity describes different types of kinematics .",
    "the situation @xmath140 appears to be typical .",
    "event  1 showed a different behavior , @xmath141 , resembling an explosion with an impulsive acceleration followed by deceleration .",
    "a special type @xmath142 ( an impulsive acceleration is required to reach @xmath136 ) might correspond to some jet - like ejections , where magnetic reconnection destroys a structure of an eruption @xcite .",
    "event  2 might have belonged to this type .    since",
    "a fs starts to expand practically from a static equilibrium in a typical situation @xmath140 , the fs - piston usually either accelerates or moves with a nearly constant speed at the self - similar stage .",
    "by contrast , shock waves in all considered events decelerated .",
    "hence , a typical fs - piston is expected to eventually approach the wave front .",
    "what does such a relation between the speeds of the shock front and piston mean ?",
    "do mhd equations allow a decelerating shock wave to run for a long time ahead of a non - decelerating fs - piston ?",
    "we search answers in a theory developed by in solving a problem of self - similar expansion of a cme preceded by a strong shock wave .",
    "though the problem was solved in a limit of very strong shock propagating in plasma with too steep density falloff @xmath143 , the solution correctly relates accelerations of the piston and piston - driven shock . assuming a common linear profile of the plasma velocity in the whole region from the expansion center up to the shock front , it is possible to relate kinematics of the shock front and the contact discontinuity , _",
    "i.e. _ , the fs - piston without a complete solution of the problem . by fitting the motion of the piston with a function @xmath144",
    ", we express the sign of the shock acceleration @xmath145 vs. @xmath146 : @xmath147 with @xmath148 .",
    "thus , the conditions @xmath149 and @xmath150 are incompatible . such an fs - piston and",
    "the shock front expand in different ways , which can not be coordinated with each other , unlike a bow shock .",
    "an impulsively excited freely propagating shock wave must eventually change to a piston - driven mode .",
    "presumably this typically occurs at large distances , probably beyond the lasco / c3 field of view .",
    "the transformation of a blast shock wave into a piston - driven one marks switch - on the aerodynamic drag and termination of the self - similar expansion regime .",
    "the drag force becomes significant , which means establishment of a continuous energy transport from the fs - piston to the shock wave .",
    "by contrast , a blast - like wave excited by an ef and running ahead of fs , which does not yet act as a piston , facilitates expansion of a cme into the solar wind .",
    "the shock wave forwards a part of its energy to the fs - piston , and the drag force is absent .",
    "most likely , real shock waves are neither purely blast waves nor purely piston ones .",
    "a shock front is sensitive to any events occurring behind it , _",
    "e.g. _ , changes of the fs - piston speed , because the fast - mode speed behind the shock front is higher than its phase speed . to produce one more shock wave ,",
    "an fs - piston has to repeat the maneuver , which produced the first shock .",
    "this is improbable when an instability driving an eruption has completed and a cme left the sun .      and considered distortions of coronal streamers as a morphological suggestion of presumable shocks . indeed ,",
    "moving wave - like kinks or deflections of coronal rays resemble an expected effect of a propagating shock wave .",
    "some fast `` cmes '' in difference images might be actually combinations of coronal rays deflected by shock waves . however , demonstrated that deflection of coronal rays could be due to expansion of a cme in magnetized corona without a shock .",
    "irrespective of a particular type of a possible shock , more reliable morphological suggestion might be a spike - like leading feature due to deviation of a coronal ray by a wave .",
    "showed such a situation in their fig .  4 , where deflected coronal rays were visible well ahead of trailing cme structures .",
    "we remind that the conic bow - shock shape is not expected , at least , for wide super - alfv ' enic cmes .",
    "the shock front must cling to its foremost edge and closest flanks , while far flanks and a rear part can be constituted by a freely propagating shock front , so that the shape of the whole front would resemble an egg .",
    "an attractive way to detect a shock front is to search for discontinuity in the density distribution shown by coronagraph images @xcite .",
    "however , this way is model dependent . besides modeling the coronal density",
    ", one has to distinguish between the shock discontinuity and the contact surface separating the cme and environment .",
    "the 3-dimensional contact surface should be also modeled .",
    "thus , identifying a shock front in coronagraph images does not seem to be a simple task .",
    "combinations of different indications seem to be be useful . a non - structured faint density enhancement forming the envelope of a transient could be among them @xcite .",
    "fast decelerating halo cmes with such edges might be shock candidates .",
    "a worthwhile shock indication might be such a halo edge crossing a distorted streamer .",
    "an important complement of morphological suggestions is kinematics of an expected shock wave and its correspondence to the drift of a type  ii burst .",
    "paper  iii also address changes in shape of a shock front occurring in its propagation in the corona .",
    "our observations and considerations suggest the following presumable scenario of a flare - related eruptive event .",
    "an eruption occurs due to a rapid development of an instability in a magnetic structure .",
    "an abruptly accelerating eruption destroys a pre - existing magnetic configuration , thus causing a flare , and produces an mhd disturbance as an impulsive piston .",
    "the disturbance appears at a height of @xmath151 mm during the rise phase of an hxr / microwave burst , leaves the piston , rapidly steepens into a shock , and then freely propagates like a blast wave .",
    "its lower trail might be observed as a decelerating moreton wave as well as an euv wave , and the wave dome is sometimes observed to expand above the limb .",
    "the motion of the shock front shows up in radio spectra as a drifting continuum and , when the shock front reaches the current sheet of a coronal streamer , as a type ii burst . for the fundamental emission",
    "this usually occurs at @xmath152 mhz ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "metric type ii bursts are expected to cease due to damping of shock waves that typically occurs above 20 mhz ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "revival of a shock is possible at a few @xmath155 due to decreasing alfvn speed , and decametric / hectometric type ii emission can appear .",
    "the complex piston - blast - piston transformations of shock waves traveling in the corona with significantly varying parameters and possible coupling of multiple shocks imply well - known disagreement between metric and interplanetary type ii events ( _ e.g. _ , ) .    expanding shock fronts can form envelopes of cmes .",
    "measurements in the cme catalog referring to a fastest feature might be related to shock waves for fast decelerating cmes , especially halos . since a shock wave decelerates",
    ", a trailing mass must eventually approach its front .",
    "the shock becomes a piston - driven one presumably at distances @xmath156 .",
    "the aerodynamic drag becomes important .",
    "this picture is consistent with results of several cited papers .",
    "the story of shock waves associated with flare - related cmes appears to be more complex than often assumed , in fact combining different scenarios .",
    "our seemingly simplified approach has resulted in surprisingly fine reconciliation of euv waves , moreton waves , metric type ii bursts , and leading edges of cmes .",
    "the first consequence is that independent of the quality of our approximation , all these phenomena are really manifestations of a common agent , _",
    "i.e. _ , a traveling coronal shock wave excited by an eruption . second , our approach indeed provides a promising instrument for analyses slow - drifting bursts and their comparison with other eruption - related phenomena .",
    "the power - law approximation turns out to work well beyond conditions , for which it was derived .",
    "our results clarify relations between flares , traveling coronal shocks , cmes , associated wave - like manifestations , type ii bursts , and provide a common quantitative description for some of these phenomena .",
    "our important by - product is an indication of the leading role of eruptions with respect to flares , _",
    "i.e. _ , that the acceleration of an eruption occurs almost independently of the flare reconnection rate",
    ".    our approach and analysis needs elaboration and continuation .",
    "a number of issues to be addressed remains .",
    "low heights , at which type ii emission sometimes appears , indicate that our consideration of its generation in the current sheet of a coronal streamer needs elaboration .",
    "data sets similar to those analyzed in our paper should be compared with imaging observations in the metric range .",
    "the analysis of decimetric to metric drifting bursts should be extended to longer radio waves in conjunction with coronagraphic observations . despite success of our self - similar shock approximation ,",
    "a more realistic weak shock approximation should be considered .",
