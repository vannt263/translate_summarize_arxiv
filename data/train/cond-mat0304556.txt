    "more than a decade the dispute on the nature of ordering in spin glasses between the mean - field theory based on the replica symmetry breaking in parisi s solution of the infinite - ranged model and the droplet theory based on a phenomenological scaling argument on the short - ranged model has remained unsettled @xcite .",
    "currently , the following two explicit predictions by the droplet theory @xcite have been extensively studied .",
    "1 ) the equilibrium sg states at two temperatures with difference @xmath0 are uncorrelated in length scales larger than the overlap length @xmath1 , i.e. , the so - called temperature(@xmath2)-chaos nature of the sg phase , and 2 ) in the equilibrium and thermodynamic limits the sg phase is broken by a static field @xmath3 of infinitesimal strength , thereby introduced is the crossover length @xmath4 .",
    "the latter separates characteristics of droplet excitations by their size @xmath5 , such that they are dominated by the zeeman energy for @xmath6 and by the sg free energy gap for @xmath7 .",
    "one may imagine that the existence of such a characteristic length @xmath8 could be easily checked by the temperature(@xmath2)-shift ( field(@xmath3)-shift ) aging protocol , where the temperature ( field ) is changed once on a way to equilibrium .",
    "however , this is rather hard because of the extremely slow spin dynamics in the sg state : within a time - window of relative magnitude of @xmath9 , which is the case not only in simulations but also in ordinary experiments , the sg correlation length , or mean domain size , @xmath10 , is considered to grow only by a factor two or even less as will be discussed below .",
    "therefore , no simulation nor experiment on such an aging protocol alone has not yet succeeded to settle the problem mentioned above . a possible strategy to overcome",
    "this difficulty is to examine a set of @xmath2-  ( @xmath3- ) shift protocols with @xmath8 systematically changed relatively to @xmath10 within the available time - window , to look for a possible scaling behavior in the length scales involved , and to check whether the behavior is compatible with the droplet theory or not @xcite .    in the present work we numerically study aging dynamics in the 3d ising ea sg model with gaussian nearest - neighbor interactions with zero mean and variance @xmath11 .",
    "the latter is used as the unit of energy and temperature . in this unit",
    "the sg transition temperature is estimated as @xmath12 @xcite . along the above - mentioned strategy",
    "we have examined a number of @xmath2- and @xmath3-shift processes with various @xmath0 and @xmath3 as well as the ( waiting ) time , @xmath13 , of the shift . for further details of the model and the monte carlo ( mc ) method of simulation",
    "the reader may refer to our previous works @xcite .    in the next section we investigate the @xmath2-chaos nature through @xmath2-shift processes , and in  3 the stability of the sg phase under a field through @xmath3-shift processes .",
    "the last section is devoted to discussions .",
    "following the idea of ` twin - experiments ' in @xcite , we examine here negative ( positive ) @xmath2-shift aging processes .",
    "a system is instantaneously quenched at time @xmath14 from @xmath15 to @xmath16 below @xmath17 , the temperature is decreased ( increased ) to @xmath18 at @xmath19 , and then let the system to age at @xmath20 . throughout the process we measure the imaginary part of the ac susceptibility of frequency @xmath21 , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "its typical behavior in a negative @xmath2-shift process is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - shift ] . by the @xmath2-shift at @xmath23 , @xmath22 rapidly decreases , and it merges to the @xmath24-isothermal curve from below . if , however , the branch of @xmath22 at @xmath25 is shifted to the _ right _ by a proper amount , @xmath26 , as indicated by the open circles in the figure , it merges to the @xmath24-isothermal curve from above at @xmath27 .",
    "the inset of the figure explains how to determine @xmath26 : when an amount of the shift is smaller than @xmath26 , the shifted branch crosses with the @xmath24-isothermal curve ( triangles in the inset ) , while a larger shift delays the merging significantly ( squares ) . here",
    "we call the time required for @xmath22 to merge to the isothermal curve in this sense the _ crossover time _ and denote it as @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "[ this characteristic time is called the effective age in  @xcite and the effective waiting time in  @xcite . ] for a positive @xmath2-shift process we can similarly define the crossover time @xmath30 @xcite . a set of results for @xmath13 and",
    "@xmath31 thus obtained are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcrosst ] .",
    "after the first quench of a negative @xmath2-shift process , the sg ordering , or the mean domain size @xmath10 , grows up to @xmath32 at @xmath33 . by the @xmath2-shift @xmath10 does not exhibit a discontinuous change , but continues to grow now with the growth rate at @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "however , it takes time @xmath31 for @xmath22 to merge to its @xmath24-isothermal curve .",
    "we suppose that in this time range , which we call the _ transient regime _ , subdomains of a mean size @xmath34 in local equilibrium of @xmath24 grows within each domains of a mean size @xmath32 in local equilibrium of @xmath35 .",
    "if @xmath32 is enough smaller than the overlap length @xmath1 introduced in  1 , we naively expect that @xmath34 catches up @xmath32 at @xmath36 , or , @xmath37 to hold , where @xmath38 is the growth law of sg domains in the isothermal aging at @xmath2 . by the first equality above we imply that the growth mechanisms of @xmath34 at @xmath2 and @xmath38 are common , i.e. , they are due to thermal activation processes .",
    "the same equation as above but with @xmath35 and @xmath24 interchanged is expected to hold for the corresponding positive @xmath2-shift process .",
    "this expectation is in fact confirmed by the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcrosst ] that the data @xmath28 vs. @xmath39 and @xmath40 vs. @xmath30 lie on a common curve for a small @xmath41 .",
    "we call the interpretation so far described the _ cumulative memory scenario _ for @xmath2-shift processes with small @xmath42 .    for later discussions",
    "let us here mention explicit expressions for the growth law of @xmath38 . within the accuracy of simulations ,",
    "the numerical results of @xmath38 @xcite are well fitted either to the logarithmic law proposed in the droplet theory @xcite @xmath43^{1/\\psi } ,   \\label{eq : rt - fh}\\ ] ] or to a power law @xmath44 above , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the characteristic length and time scales , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 the characteristic scale of energy barrier of droplet excitations and the associated exponent , respectively . in eq.([eq : rt(t ) ] ) we set @xmath49 1 lattice distance and @xmath50 1 mc step per spin , and the exponent @xmath51 is given by @xcite @xmath52 with @xmath53 in the range @xmath54 .    for a large @xmath55 , the sets of data of negative and positive @xmath2-shift processes in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcrosst ] differ significantly from each other .",
    "also the second equality of eq.([eq : tcross ] ) is violated for the negative @xmath2-shift process shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : t - shift ] .",
    "we tentatively attribute this deviation from the cumulative memory scenario to the temperature - chaos nature of the equilibrium sg phase described in  1 .",
    "if @xmath1 is smaller than @xmath56 , then in the time range after the @xmath2-shift in which @xmath57 is satisfied , aging dynamics looks as if the system is already in the @xmath24-isothermal aging state .",
    "this is because , by definition of @xmath1 , the longer range order than @xmath1 developed at @xmath58 is irrelevant to the sg order at @xmath59 .",
    "therefore @xmath31 is given by the condition @xmath60 , and is independent of @xmath13 in this case .",
    "however , @xmath13 in the present simulation is not large enough to reproduce such a drastic phenomenon .",
    "we consider that the negative @xmath2-shift process observed here is in the _ weak chaos regime _ proposed by jnsson _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "we also note that the second equality of eq.([eq : tcross ] ) is little violated in the positive @xmath2-shift with @xmath61 .",
    "this asymmetric appearance of the chaos effect contradicts the prediction of the droplet theory @xcite as well as the recent experiment on the heisenberg spin glass agmn @xcite .",
    "the @xmath3-shift processes we mainly discuss here are as follows . after instantaneous quench to @xmath2 ,",
    "the system is aged under a zero field until @xmath33 , when a field @xmath3 is switched on .",
    "we then observe the induced ( zero - field - cooled ) magnetization @xmath62 and @xmath22 in the whole process .",
    "we study them exclusively at @xmath63 where the aging dynamics is considered not affected by the critical dynamics close to @xmath17 .    it is well established that , at least for a small @xmath3 , the logarithmic growth rate of @xmath64 defined by @xmath65 with @xmath66 exhibits a peak at @xmath67 .",
    "more generally , the peak position of @xmath68 plays the same role as @xmath31 discussed in the previous section .",
    "it gives us a characteristic time scale of crossover from the isothermal aging state under @xmath69 to that under a finite @xmath3 , and so is denoted also by @xmath31 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : soft - up ] we show @xmath68 with @xmath70 for various values of @xmath3 . for a small @xmath71 ,",
    "as mentioned just above , @xmath72 is ascertained .",
    "when @xmath3 increases , however , @xmath31 significantly decreases . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcr - tw ] the resultant @xmath31 for various @xmath3 and @xmath13 are presented .",
    "now we convert the relations between @xmath31 and @xmath13 into those between the characteristic length scales @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "the effective crossover length @xmath75 is the mean size of subdomains grown under @xmath3 in the period of @xmath31 and has to be estimated by the growth law under @xmath3 . since , however , it is quite time - consuming to simulate the latter due to the presence of the paramagnetic component , we approximate it by @xmath76 , i.e. , by eq.([eq : rt(t ) ] ) in the present work .",
    "the obtained sets of @xmath75 and @xmath74 for different @xmath3 are normalized by the crossover length @xmath4 introduced in  1 .",
    "it is given by @xcite @xmath77 with @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the unit of free - energy gap .",
    "in evaluating explicitly @xmath4 by eq.([eq : lcrh ] ) we simply put @xmath79 unity and @xmath80 with @xmath81 and @xmath82 @xcite .",
    "the resultant scaling plot of @xmath83 vs. @xmath84 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcreff - scal ] .",
    "one sees in the figure that most of the data tend to lie on a single curve .",
    "if we take into account the fact that we have not adjusted the parameters involved at all , the scaling behavior obtained is quite satisfactory .",
    "we interpret the scaling behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rcreff - scal ] as dynamical crossover from the sg aging state to the paramagnetic state . actually , in the range @xmath85 , where @xmath38 measured within the time window of our simulation is much smaller than @xmath4 , various properties which are usually regarded as those of the sg state are observed . among them are the so - called @xmath86-scaling of the ac susceptibility in the isothermal aging @xcite and the sum rule @xmath87 @xcite , where @xmath88 is the induced magnetization observed when @xmath3 is applied just after the quench to @xmath2 and @xmath89 is the thermoremanent magnetization observed after @xmath3 in the field - cooled process is switched off at @xmath33 . in the range @xmath90 corresponding to a large field of @xmath91 , on the contrary",
    ", the complete saturation of @xmath92 and @xmath88 to a common value is observed within the time window of our simulation .",
    "this is the expected property of the paramagnetic state .",
    "combined with these observations which will be discussed elsewhere , we conclude that the result of fig .",
    "[ fig : rcreff - scal ] is a strong support of the droplet picture for the @xmath3-shift aging process and so the instability of sg state in the equilibrium and thermodynamic limits .",
    "lastly let us try to extend the scaling behavior obtained above by our simulation on the ising ea model to the one in real ising spin glasses such as , focusing on the crossover point defined by the condition @xmath93 .",
    "here we use the power growth law of eq.([eq : rt(t ) ] ) with @xmath94s .",
    "then , with the same approximations , such as @xmath95 , as those already introduced , the condition is reduced to @xmath96 also using @xmath97 and @xmath80 as in the simulation , we obtain , for example , @xmath98 t for @xmath99 and @xmath100  s. a set of these figures is compared with @xmath101  t , @xmath102 and @xmath103  s , which are picked up from the paper by katori and ito @xcite , who determined the critical temperature @xmath104 under @xmath3 of   as the one where the @xmath92 starts to deviate from @xmath88 . in a certain range of @xmath104",
    ", they found the relation @xmath105 with @xmath106 which is the expected behavior of the de almaid - thouless phase transition @xcite in the infinite - ranged sg model .",
    "however , the rather good coincidence of the above two sets of vaules , combined with the dependence of @xmath3 on @xmath2 from eq.([eq : length - h ] ) with a fixed @xmath107 equal to the measuring time @xmath108 in their temperature sweeping experiment ( not shown ) , suggests that @xmath104 they measured could be interpreted as the dynamical crossover point with @xmath109 .",
    "another experiment on  under large static field @xmath3 was done by mattsson _",
    "@xcite , who measured the ac suceptibility .",
    "they found two regimes in its behavior which are separated by the the freezing temperature @xmath110 .",
    "although what they measued is droplet excitations almost in equilibrium but not domains in aging , we may use eq.([eq : length - h ] ) with @xmath111 , i.e. , @xmath112 is the temprature at which the mean size of droplets which can respond to the ac field of period @xmath113 is equal to @xmath4 .",
    "then eq.([eq : length - h ] ) yields , for example , @xmath114  t with @xmath115  s and @xmath116 , while the corresponding experimental value is @xmath117  t.    although we do not want to insist strongly the semi - quantitative agreement of the experimental results with a simple extension of the simulational results , we may claim from the above argument that @xmath31 for field - shift processes under @xmath3 of a few oe is beyond the astronomical time .",
    "on the interpretation of aging phenomena in spin glasses by means of the droplet picture , the length scales of certain domains and droplets play a central role . in the above arguments , they are @xmath1 , @xmath4 , @xmath74 , and @xmath34 . in the numerical study so far carried out @xcite ,",
    "@xmath38 is replaced by the coherence length of the real replica overlap function which has been explicitly evaluated .",
    "since the overlap function is obtained by averaging over sites in each sample and then over samples , detailed properties of each domains , such as whether they are fractal or compact , are averaged out , and so they are beyond the scope of the present simulation .",
    "neither the nature of subdomains has been directly pursued by simulation yet .",
    "but its introduction with the _ subdomains - within - domain scenario _",
    "@xcite helps us very much to interpret the observed phenomena in the transient regime after the @xmath2- or @xmath3-shift as well as the _ memory effect _ observed in the @xmath2- or @xmath3-cycling processes @xcite .",
    "for example , even in the cummulative regime of fig .",
    "[ fig : rcreff - scal ] with @xmath118 , rejuvenation - like behavior ( or a jump - up ) in @xmath22 has been observed both in experiment @xcite and the present simulation ( not shown ) .    another fundamental ingredient of the analysis based on the droplet picture is the growth law of @xmath38 , which is frequently used as the conversion formula from the time scale to the length scale .",
    "however it is hard to accurately determine it due to the following circumstances .",
    "let us consider the ratio @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the maximum ( minimum ) time scale of observation .",
    "the results of our simulation with @xmath121 and @xmath122 yield , say at @xmath99 , @xmath123 .",
    "if eqs.([eq : rt(t ) ] ) and ( [ eq : z_t ] ) with @xmath94  s and @xmath97 are extended to the time scale of ordinary experiments , i.e. , @xmath124  s and @xmath125  s , the identical @xmath126 is obtained .",
    "when the logarithmic law of eq.([eq : rt - fh ] ) is applied to the experimental data , @xmath126 becomes even smaller @xcite .",
    "we may say that , both in experiments and simulations , we measure a very limited portion of an equilibration process , at least the length scale of sg ordering is concerned .",
    "this is the reason of difficulty in determining the growth law of @xmath38 accurately .    in order to investigate the stability of the equilibrium sg state against perturbations such as the temperature change @xmath0 and a static field @xmath3 , thereby overcoming the above - mentioned difficulty , we have carried out a set of shift - aging protocols where the perturbation of various strengths , @xmath127 or @xmath128 , is applied after the waiting time @xmath13 which are also systematically changed . for each process specified by @xmath129",
    ", we have extracted the crossover time @xmath31 between the state aging to an unperturved sg state and the one to the perturbed sg , or non - sg state .",
    "the length scales @xmath130 associated with @xmath31 are then found to be scaled nicely by the characteristic length scale associated with @xmath131 .",
    "this strategy , first carried out in  @xcite , is expected to be most efficient to judge the stability of the equilibrium sg state by actual experiments .",
    "irrespectively of the strategy mentioned above , experiments to extract @xmath38 with referring to another length scale independently of the growth law itself are certainly very much required . to our knowledge , however , there has been only two such experiments which use a length scale associated with the static field effect .",
    "one is due to mattsson _",
    "et al _ @xcite already mentioned above and the other due to joh _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "the latter result prefers the power law of eq.([eq : rt(t ) ] ) with the value of @xmath132 in @xmath51 nearly equal to our numerical results . from this point of view ,",
    "an experiment on sg fine particle systems may be of interest .",
    "to conclude we have presented and discussed the results of our simulation on the @xmath2- and @xmath3-shift aging processes in the 3d ising ea sg model . in the @xmath2-shift process",
    "only a precursor of the temperature - chaos effect has been observed , while the results on the @xmath3-shift process strongly support the droplet picture that the sg state under a finite field is unstable in the equilibrium and thermodynamic limits , though it takes astronomic time for the sg state to be broken if @xmath3 is small .",
    "i would like to sincerely thank k. hukushima , p. jnsson , h. yoshino , and e. vincent for their fruitful discussions .",
