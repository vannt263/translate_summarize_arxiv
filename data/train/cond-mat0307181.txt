    "since the early applications of the gw method to real materials ( see refs . 1 - 3 and references therein ) , the pseudopotential plane - wave approach has been the method of choice due to its accuracy and technical simplicity .",
    "recent advances in lapw and lmto methodologies have allowed the implementation of `` all - electron '' applications of the gw method.@xcite one common feature of such calculations , using standard level of approximation for the self - energy , is an underestimation of the electronic energy gap compared to experimental measurements , whereas pseudopotential - based calculations show very good agreement with experiment . to explain this inconsistency , it was proposed that the pseudopotential approach does not correctly describe the effect of core orbitals in the self - energy corrections to the energy gaps , resulting in overestimated corrections.@xcite    it is thus desirable to elucidate the effect of core orbitals in the quasiparticle band structure , and the preferred procedure is to perform a well converged all - electron calculation and compare its results with similarly converged pseudopotential - based calculations . obviously , numerical precision should not be neglected . in this work ,",
    "we explicitly include semicore orbitals in the pseudopotential plane - wave approach and calculate the quasiparticle energy gap for three semiconductors of technical importance : si , ge and gaas .",
    "the underlying description of the ground - state electronic structure is based on density functional theory in the local density approximation ( dft / lda).@xcite throughout this work , we are careful to converge all results systematically , and the final results are compared to previous pseudopotential results and to recent all - electron calculations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : we outline the theoretical method in section ii .",
    "results are presented in section iii and discussed in section iv .",
    "the pseudopotential formalism has two advantages that make it convenient for practical _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "first , degrees of freedom due to core electrons are removed from the system , resulting in a description that contains only valence electrons .",
    "second , valence electronic pseudowavefunctions are smooth in the vicinity of atomic sites as well as in the interstitial region .",
    "such valence wavefunctions can be expanded to convergence easily in a relatively small basis set such as a plane - wave basis . on the other hand ,",
    "one possible problem with this formalism is that using pseudopotentials , instead of the true electron - ion potential , may not fully describe all effects produced by interactions between the valence and core electrons . in order to address this issue in gw calculations ,",
    "we include in the present study electrons from the outermost valence shell as well as those from the second outermost ( `` semicore '' ) atomic shell as active `` valence '' electrons in the pseudopotential formalism .",
    "only interactions between these `` valence '' electrons and electrons from the deeper core shells are described by pseudopotentials . taking si as an example ,",
    "its `` core '' now contains only @xmath0 electrons .",
    "electrons from the @xmath1,@xmath2,@xmath3,@xmath4 , and @xmath5 shells are all treated on equal footing in the subsequent calculations .",
    "apart from the atomic configuration , we follow the standard prescription for generating _ ab initio _ pseudopotentials . @xcite",
    "since the deeper core electrons have extremely large binding energy ( _ e.g. _ , 130 ry for the @xmath6 electrons in atomic si ) , their interaction with valence electrons is expected to be much weaker than the already small interaction between the outermost valence and the semicore electrons.@xcite    the kohn - sham dft formalism within the lda is used to solve for the ground state electronic structure and to provide a starting point for the calculation of the electron self - energy .",
    "we follow closely the gw method as developed by hybertsen and louie . in this method , the self - energy is given by the standard gw approximation ,    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the one - electron green s function , calculated from lda energy eigenvalues and eigenstates ( @xmath9 for occupied states , @xmath10 for unoccupied states ) ,    @xmath11    the screened coulomb interaction @xmath12 is calculated within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) as @xmath13^{-1 } v$ ] , with @xmath14 being the bare coulomb interaction and the polarizability @xmath15.@xcite this is the commonly employed level of approximation for gw calculations ( _ i.e. _ neglecting self - consistency and vertex corrections ) @xcite , and we specifically compare results from both pseudopotential and all - electron calculations at this particular level of approximation to help untangle the effects of core states .",

    ".    in all systems studied , we applied the gpp model in two ways : ( 1 ) using only the valence charge density in the f - sum rule , and ( 2 ) using a total charge density from both the valence and semicore bands .",
    "method ( 1 ) is physically more realistic , and predicts an energy dependence of the inverse dielectric function that is consistent with the rpa .",
    "method ( 2 ) implies that semicore electrons are able to screen electric fields as efficiently as valence electrons , which is not physical . nevertheless , we find agreement between the two schemes to better than 0.1 ev in the converged energy gap for all systems studied .",
    "this is a consequence of cancellation of errors : in method ( 2 ) , the plasma frequency is overestimated , and therefore the contributions @xmath25 and @xmath26 are overestimated in absolute value .",
    "since they have opposite sign , the final quasiparticle energies are weakly affected .",
    "we also observe that method ( 2 ) shows slower convergence of energy gaps with respect to @xmath41 , which is expected since the @xmath26 term is enhanced . all results presented in this article",
    "were obtained using the physically more appropriate method ( 1 ) .",
    "as shown in figures [ f.si]-[f.gaas ] , energy gaps in the gw approximation have a significant dependence on the number of unoccupied bands that is slow to converge in many cases .",

    "although we have not directly investigated the importance of imposing self - consistency in the calculation of the self - energy , this is an unsetled issue and we address it briefly below .",
    "von barth and holm have investigated the effect of self - consistency in the electron gas,@xcite and concluded that restricted self - consistency has small but significant effect on the full bandwidth and in the satellite structure of the electron gas . on the other hand ,",

    "inclusion of vertex corrections are expected to recover the good , non - self - consistent results , but calculation of vertex corrections is not a simple task even for the electron gas system.@xcite self - consistency has been recently applied to real materials,@xcite and the valence bandwidth is also shown to increase when self - consistency is imposed .",
    "it appears that one must therefore include self - consistency and vertex corrections together in order to obtain a meaningful picture .",
    "inclusion of vertex corrections and self - consistency is tangential for the purpose of our work , which is to compare pseudopotential - based and all - electron gw calculations and understand the role of semicore electrons .",
    "we conclude that for the systems considered , the valence - only pseudopotential method does not suffer from large errors from the neglect of core states , as claimed in some all - electron calculations . @xcite while semicore effects are negligible in si , they are important if one aims at good quantitative agreement with experiment in ge and gaas.@xcite however , discrepancies between pseudopotential and all - electron based gw calculations reported in recent works @xcite may be explained by a lack of numerical convergence in the latter . specifically , the self - energy calculated within the gw method has slow convergence with respect to the number of energy bands included in the calculation of the green s function , as is demonstrated in this work and has been pointed out in the past .",
