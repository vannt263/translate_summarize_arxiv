    "fueled by novel fabrication , miniaturization , and characterization techniques nanomagnetism has been a crucial element for the ongoing advances in nanotechnology .",
    "e.g. , the current high - density information magnetic storage is achieved by nano structures having out - of - plane ( or perpendicular ) magnetization @xcite .",
    "decreasing further the size of the nanostructures would allow for yet higher storage capacity , but at some critical size ( depending on the material , typically below 3 - 50 nm ) the magnetization starts flipping randomly its direction due to thermal activation which marks superparamagnetic state of the system @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is well - known with implications for a variety of applications including magnetic fluids , magnetic refrigeration , magnetic resonance imaging , and drug delivery schemes @xcite .",
    "thus , finding ways to tune superparamagnetism and/or to stabilize the magnetization while downsizing the nano clusters is an issue of key importance . a highly desirable way would be to achieve this goal via external electric means which would imply less energy consumption than magnetic fields and more flexibility than the synthesis of new material compositions with engineered magnetic anisotropy energy density @xmath1 which is a decisive factor for superparamagnetism .",
    "indeed the nel relaxation time @xmath2 , i.e. the mean time between successive flips depends exponentially on the magnetic anisotropy energy @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is the particle volume ) with respect to the thermal energy @xcite ( i.e. @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a material specific attempt time ) .",
    "small variations in the energy barrier @xmath3 affect substantially @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , increasing @xmath1 allows for smaller @xmath4 while maintaining @xmath2 . from this perspective , coupled ferroelectric / magnetic nanostructures @xcite such as those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] are highly interesting : indeed , studying the ferromagnetic resonance behavior of such a composite material we have shown recently theoretically @xcite that the magnetoelectric ( me ) coupling acts as an additional unidirectional anisotropy that can be influenced by an electric field due to the electric response of the ferroelectric part of the composite structure .",
    "these predictions were subsequently confirmed in a recent experiment for co / batio@xmath0-interface @xcite .",
    "superparamagnetic behavior of this structure is expected thus to be highly sensitive to the magnetoelectric coupling , even if this coupling is weak .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that sofar , a major obstacle for applications of multiferroics is the smallness of the magnetoelectric coupling .",

    "might be captured e.g. by the telegraph noise technique@xcite , where the response of the system is measured as a function of time at different temperatures .",
    "for a two - state system the number of switchings between the two stable states can be counted and the average of these switches yields a mean switching time at a given temperature . theoretically , the physical process might be formulated in the framework of the langevin approach@xcite , for which the properties of thermal ( white ) noise might also be defined . from the construction of the corresponding fokker - planck equation @xcite the so called mean first passage time ( mfpt ) - the average time needed for the system to overcome the potential barrier due to thermal fluctuations - can be defined@xcite and calculated .",

    "we find that the fm switching times are sensitive to the applied electric field @xmath75 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ) , however , not to the strength of the field , but rather to its direction , i.e. , once the strong electric field switched the polarization ( red and blue points in fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ) , it also led to visible changes of the fm switching times . + an essential finding depicted in fig . [ fig_4 ]",
    "is that for a fixed particle size the switching time can be modified by more than an order of magnitude by the me coupling assisted by an electric field . in other words , the size of particles with the same switching time can be decreased substantially by me coupling .",
    "in fact , particles that are already superparamagnetic can be stabilized by me coupling .",
    "this fact can in turn serve as an indicator for me coupling , in particular , the dependence of the applied external electric field . as stated in the introduction this strong dependence",
    "is not really surprising since the switching time depends exponentially on the energy barrier that is modified in a linear way by the me coupling ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a discussion of the physics behind the exponential behavior ) .",
    "+ in addition to switching times the calculations of hysteresis were performed for the temperature range accounting for different structural phases of batio@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] ) .",
    "since temperature assists the magnetization switching process , it results in a reduction of the coercive fields .",
    "relatively low frequency @xmath82  [ ghz ] corresponding to the period of @xmath83  [ ns ] was chosen to provide sufficient relaxation , whereas the relaxation time of the nanoparticle is mainly governed by the damping parameter and scales according to @xmath84  [ ns ] .",
    "additionally , we observe a small shift of hysteresis curves due to the presence of a unidirectional anisotropy induced by the me coupling .",
    "for the linear me coupling this effect is supposed to be similar to the exchange bias effect @xcite , which is sizable for fm nanoparticles .",
    "we consider the superparamagnetic behavior of composite multiferroics , in particular fe nano islands on batio@xmath0 . for realistic material parameters we demonstrated fe magnetization switching control via external electric fields which should be feasible experimentally by means of telegraph noise .",
    "an important finding is that the fm switching times , expressed as mean first passage times @xcite , can be tuned by orders of magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] ) by magnetoelectric coupling and electric fields acting on the fe polarization .",
    "our theoretical tools included analytical results and numerical simulations . by this",
    "we stress that analytical formulae ( e.g. eq .",
    "( [ eq_11 ] ) ) should be applied carefully , since the analytical derivations are based on numerous approximations , e.g. on the high energy barrier limit and absorbing boundary conditions , meaning that multiple barrier crossings are not possible . in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] shows that as long as the me coupling is small ( @xmath85 [ s / f ] ) , theory and simulations are in good agreement ( cf . dots and curves ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that from telegraph noise experiments performed on such systems one could determine the values of the me coupling , assuming that it is linear . in this case we expect that fitting of the switching time as a function of temperature according to eq .",
    "( [ eq_11 ] ) should be realizable . from switching of the polarization direction it should be possible to derive the value of the effective field induced by the me coupling and finally to relate it to the me coupling constant from eqs .",
    "( [ eq_6 ] ) and ( [ eq_11 ] ) .",
    "we stress , however , that in general eq .",
    "( [ eq_11 ] ) is symmetric with respect to the applied @xmath86-field , therefore , in order to obtain sizable effect experimentally , one should fix the initial magnetization state , e.g. by external applied magnetic field .",
    "it should also be emphasized that the so called pinning site effects reported in refs .",
    "@xcite will not strongly modify the results reported here , since the ferroelectricity is controlled by a strong electric field , which indirectly acts on the magnetization .",
    "+ further forms of the me coupling might strongly modify the obtained results .",
    "assuming that the me coupling energy has an additional contribution that scales as @xmath87 , then the total effective field acting on the magnetization attains additionally a term that is linear in magnetization .",
    "this would lead to the modification of the height of the energy barrier defined by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy strength @xmath88 .",
    "when the magnetization is aligned along the z - direction , the coupling with @xmath89 will result in a modification of the prefactor @xmath90 in eq .",

    "+ the final remark concerns the form of the fm nanoparticles , which in general might have a form different from an ideal sphere leading to the effect of sufficiently strong demagnetizing fields @xcite .",
    "the presented results rely on the idealization of flat nanoparticles ( demagnetizing factor @xmath92 ) , giving rise to an axially symmetric contribution to the fm free energy ( eq .",
    "( [ eq_12 ] ) ) and correcting thus the total effective field acting on the magnetization .",
