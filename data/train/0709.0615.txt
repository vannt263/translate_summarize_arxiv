    "femtosecond pulses offer unique ways to coherently control photo - induced quantum dynamics of matter @xcite .",
    "the corresponding key characteristic is their coherence over a broad spectrum .",
    "multiphoton absorption processes in atoms and molecules , which are of fundamental scientific importance as well as applicative importance to the fields of nonlinear spectroscopy and microscopy , are among the processes that have been controlled most effectively by shaped femtosecond pulses @xcite .",
    "the control principle is the coherent manipulation of interferences among the manifold of initial - to - final state - to - state multiphoton pathways that are induced by the pulse .",
    "constructive interferences lead to absorption enhancement ( i.e. , increased transition probability ) , while destructive interferences lead to absorption attenuation ( i.e. , decreased transition probability ) . the interference manipulation is implemented by shaping the femtosecond pulse @xcite , i.e. , manipulating the spectral phase , amplitude , and/or polarization of its different frequency components .",
    "hence , in order to fully utilize the coherent control potential of a given excitation scheme , the ideal line of action is shaping the pulse based on an initial identification of the different multiphoton pathways and their interference mechanism .",
    "when such identification is not possible , a practical partial solution is to use automatic experimental optimization of the pulse shape using learning algorithms that generally considering the system as a black box @xcite .",
    "the lesson , which can be learned from the many successful coherent control studies of multiphoton absorption conducted in the past @xcite , is that this ideal line of action is feasible and very powerful once the photo - excitation picture is available in the frequency domain .",
    "this is possible only within the framework of perturbation theory , where a valid perturbative description in the time domain is ( fourier ) transformed to the frequency domain .",
    "however , until recently the frequency domain has been exploited only in the weak - field regime @xcite , where the n - photon absorption is described by perturbation theory of the lowest non - vanishing order , i.e. , the n@xmath0 order .",
    "physically it means that the n - photon absorption is coherently induced by all the possible initial - to - final state - to - state pathways of n absorbed photons . for two - photon absorption",
    "the lowest order is the 2@xmath1 one , involving all the pathways of two absorbed photons @xcite .",
    "the downside of being limited to the weak - field regime is the low absorption yields associated with it . for two - photon absorption they are typically below 0.1% population transfer .",
    "recently @xcite , we have extended the powerful frequency - domain picture of femtosecond two - photon absorption to a regime of considerable absorption yields , exceeding the weak - field yields by more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "it corresponds to intermediate field strengths , where the interfering pathways are the weak - field ( non - resonant ) pathways of two absorbed photons as well as additional four - photon pathways of three absorbed photons and one emitted photon .",
    "the picture is based on 4@xmath0-order perturbation theory , which includes both the 2@xmath1 and 4@xmath0 orders associated , respectively , with the two- and four - photon pathways .",
    "the relative contribution of the 4@xmath0-order absorption amplitude increases as the field strength ( pulse intensity ) increases .",
    "this intermediate - field regime is distinguished from the strong - field regime where no perturbative description is valid .",
    "the strong - field regime is actually the one that all the other past multiphoton control studies , which have deviated from the weak - field regime , have focused on @xcite .",
    "our previous work @xcite has focused on the family of spectral phase patterns that are anti - symmetric around half the two - photon transition frequency ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "we have found this family to enhance the intermediate - field two - photon absorption relative to the unshaped transform - limited pulse , when the central spectral frequency is properly detuned , to the red or to the blue ( depending on the system ) , from @xmath2 .    in the present work we systematically study in detail the intermediate - field coherent control and the corresponding interference mechanisms , including their dependence on the pulse spectrum and its detuning from @xmath2 .",
    "the absorption dynamics in the intermediate - field regime is compared with the one in the weak - field regime .",
    "the model system is the sodium ( na ) atom . as a test case for femtosecond phase control",
    "the study uses the family of shaped pulses having a @xmath3 spectral phase step , which in the weak - field regime allows high degree of control over the full accessible range of the non - resonant two - photon absorption .",
    "section  [ sec : theoretical ] presents and elaborates on the extended frequency - domain 4@xmath0-order perturbative theoretical description .",
    "the na intermediate - field control results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "they include experimental results , exact non - perturbative results calculated by the numerical propagation of the time - dependent schrdinger equation , and perturbative results calculated numerically using the frequency - domain 4@xmath0-order formulation .",
    "the formers are used to validate the latter .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , the perturbative results are analyzed and discussed based on their corresponding frequency - domain description , which allows the identification of the interference mechanisms leading to the different intermediate - field features .",
    "the atomic femtosecond two - photon absorption process we consider is from an initial ground state @xmath4 to a final excited state @xmath5 , which are coupled via a manifold states @xmath6 having the proper symmetry .",
    "the spectrum of the pulse is such that all the @xmath4-@xmath6 and @xmath5-@xmath6 couplings are non - resonant , i.e. , the spectral amplitude at all the corresponding transition frequencies is zero : @xmath7 , except for the @xmath5-@xmath8 resonant coupling for which in general @xmath9 .",
