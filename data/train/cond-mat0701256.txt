    "the effect of weak quenched disorder on large - scale properties and phase diagrams of many - body systems attracted considerable attention for decades . despite significant efforts ,",
    "there still remain many open questions .",
    "the prominent example is the @xmath0 model in which an @xmath8-component order parameter ( the magnetization in the spin system notation ) is coupled to a symmetry - breaking random field . for @xmath9 , it is known as the random field ising model ( rfim).@xcite for @xmath10 , one has to distinguish the random field ( rf ) case where the order parameter couples linearly to disorder , and the random anisotropy ( ra ) case , where the coupling to disorder is bilinear .",
    "these models are relevant for a variety of physical systems such as amorphous magnets,@xcite diluted antiferromagnets in a uniform external magnetic field,@xcite liquid crystals in porous media,@xcite critical fluids in aerogels,@xcite nematic elastomers,@xcite and vortex phases of impure superconductors .",
    "@xcite for @xmath9 , the ra model reduces to the random - temperature model , where the randomness couples to the local energy density as , for example , in diluted ferromagnets.@xcite in contrast to the systems with random - temperature - like disorder , the rf and ra models suffer from the so - called dimensional reduction ( dr ) . a straightforward analysis of the feynman diagrams giving the leading singularities yields to all orders that the critical behavior of the rf @xmath0 model in @xmath11 dimension is the same as that of the pure system in @xmath12 dimensions.@xcite consequently",
    ", the lower critical dimension is @xmath13 for ising - like systems and @xmath14 for systems with continuous symmetry .",
    "this can elegantly be demonstrated using supersymmetry.@xcite however , simple imry - ma arguments show that the lower critical dimension of the rfim is @xmath15.@xcite the deviation from dr is also confirmed by the high - temperature expansion.@xcite thus dr breaks down , rendering standard field theoretic methods useless .",
    "another known problem where the perturbation theory is spoiled by dr is elastic manifolds in disordered media .",
    "there , two methods were developed to overcome difficulties related to dr : the gaussian variational approximation ( gva ) in replica space and the functional renormalization group ( frg ) .",
    "the gva is supposed to be exact in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "unfortunately , this approach when applied to the rf problem leads to very complicated equations which do not allow us to compute the critical exponents.@xcite considering the rf @xmath0 model , fisher @xcite showed that expansion around the lower critical dimension @xmath17 generates an infinite number of relevant operators which can be parametrized by a single function .",
    "however , he found that the corresponding one - loop frg equation has no analytic fixed point ( fp ) solution . only recently , using the progress in the elastic manifold problem,@xcite it was realized that the scaling properties of systems exhibiting metastability are encoded in a nonanalytic fp .",
    "feldman @xcite has shown that , indeed , in @xmath18 and for @xmath19 ( a more precise computation@xcite gives @xmath20 ) , there is a nonanalytic fp with a cusp at the origin .",
    "this fp provides the description for the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic phase transition in the rf @xmath0 model and allows one to compute the critical exponents which are different from the dr prediction .",
    "recently , le doussal and wiese @xcite extended the frg analysis to two - loop order .",
    "the extension beyond one - loop order is highly nontrivial due to the nonanalytic character of the renormalized effective action , which leads to anomalous terms in the frg equation.@xcite the two - loop calculations were also independently performed in ref .  , and the truncated exact frg was proposed in ref .",
    ". the more accurate analysis of the frg flows for the rf model showed that for @xmath21 there is a crossover to a fp with weaker nonanalyticity resulting in the dr critical exponents.@xcite a similar picture was found for the ra @xmath0 model with the main difference that @xmath22 and @xmath23.@xcite    a more peculiar issue concerns the phase diagram of the rf and ra models below @xmath24 .",
    "it is known that for the rf model and models with isotropic distributions of random anisotropies true long - range order is forbidden below @xmath17 ( for anisotropic distributions , long - range order can occur even below @xmath24).@xcite however , quasi - long - range order ( qlro ) with zero order parameter and an infinite correlation length can persist even for @xmath25 . for instance , the gva predicts that the vortex lattice in disordered type - ii superconductors can form the so - called bragg glass exhibiting slow logarithmic growth of displacements.@xcite this system can be mapped onto the rf @xmath26 model , in which the bragg glass corresponds to the qlro phase .",
    "indeed , for @xmath27 and @xmath25 , the frg equations have attractive fps which describe the qlro phases of rf and ra models .",
    "@xcite in order to study the transition between the qlro phase and the disordered phase expected in the limit of strong disorder , one has to go beyond the one - loop approximation .",
    "the truncated exact frg ( ref .  ) and the two - loop frg ( ref .  ) performed using a double expansion in @xmath28 and @xmath29 give access to a different singly unstable fp which is expected to control the transition .",
    "both methods give qualitatively similar pictures of the frg flows : the critical and attractive fps merge in some dimension @xmath30 that is therefore the lower critical dimension of the qlro - disordered transition .",
    "for the rf @xmath26 model , both methods predict approximately the same lower critical dimension @xmath31 , and thus , suggest that there is no bragg glass phase in @xmath32 .",
    "however , one has to take caution when extrapolating results obtained for small @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , in contrast to the model of refs .   and which belongs to the so - called `` hard - spin '' models , the system studied in ref .   corresponds to `` soft spins '' , and thus , is expected to belong to a different universality class . in terms of vortices , the soft spin rf model allows for topological defects which destroy the bragg glass .",
    "most studies of the rf and ra models are restricted to either short - range ( sr ) correlated disorder or uncorrelated pointlike defects .",
    "however , real systems often contain long - range ( lr ) correlated disorder or extended defects in the form of linear dislocations , planar grain boundaries , three - dimensional cavities , etc .",
    "systems with anisotropic orientation of extended defects can be described by a model in which all defects are strongly correlated in @xmath33 dimensions and randomly distributed over the remaining @xmath34 dimensions .",
    "the case @xmath35 is associated with uncorrelated pointlike defects , while extended columnar or planar defects are related to the cases @xmath36 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the critical behavior of the @xmath0 model with random - temperature - like extended defects was studied in refs .   using a perturbative rg analysis in conjunction with a double expansion in @xmath37 and @xmath33 .    in the case of an isotropic distribution of disorder ,",
    "power - law correlations are the simplest example with the possibility for a scaling behavior with new fps and new critical exponents .",
    "the critical behavior of systems with random - temperature disorder correlated as @xmath38 for large separation @xmath2 was studied in refs .  .",
    "the power law can be ascribed to extended defects of internal dimension @xmath4 , distributed with random orientation in @xmath11 dimensional space . in general , one would probably not expect a pure power - law decay of correlations .",
    "however , if the correlations of defects arise from different sources with a broad distribution of characteristic length scales , one can expect that the resulting correlations will , over several decades , be approximated by an effective power law.@xcite power - law correlations with a noninteger value @xmath4 can be found in systems containing defects with fractal dimension @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite for example , the behavior of @xmath39 in aerogels is argued to be described by an xy model with lr correlated defects .",
    "@xcite this is closely related to the behavior of nematic liquid crystals enclosed in a single pore of aerosil gel which was recently studied in ref .  , using the approximation in which the pore hull is considered a disconnected fractal .",
    "the frg was used to investigate the statics and dynamics of elastic manifolds in media with lr correlated disorder in ref .  .",
    "the critical behavior of the @xmath0 model with lr correlated rf was studied in refs .  .",
    "however , the methods used in these works fail to describe properly the case of sr correlated rf .",
    "therefore , there is a necessity to reexamine the critical behavior of the lr rf model using methods which are successful in the sr case .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the lr correlated rf and ra @xmath0 models using the frg to one - loop order .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] , we introduce the lr rf and ra models , and derive the frg equations . in sec .",
    "[ sec - rf ] , we study the lr rf model . in sec .",
    "[ sec - ra ] , we consider the lr ra model and discuss the application to superfluid @xmath7he in aerogels .",
    "the final section summarizes our results .",
    "the large - scale behavior of the @xmath0 symmetric spin systems at low temperatures can be described by the nonlinear @xmath4 model with the hamiltonian @xmath40 = \\int d^d x \\left [     \\frac{1}{2 } ( \\nabla \\vec{s}\\,)^2 + v(x,\\vec{s } ) \\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the @xmath8-component classical spin with a fixed - length constraint @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is the random disorder potential , which can be expanded in spin variables as follows : @xmath44 the corresponding coefficients have simple physical interpretation : @xmath45 is a random field , @xmath46 is a random second - rank anisotropy , and @xmath47 are general @xmath48th tensor anisotropies . as was shown in ref .",
    ", even if the system has only finite number of nonzero @xmath47 , the rg transformations generate an infinite set of high - rank anisotropies preserving the symmetry with respect to rotation @xmath49 if it is present in the bare model .",
    "for instance , starting with only second - rank anisotropy corresponding to the ra model , all even - rank anisotropies will be generated by the rg flow .",
    "we will reserve the notation ra for the systems which have this symmetry and the notation rf for the systems which do not . in the present work ,",

    "power counting suggests that @xmath58 is the lower critical dimension for both models.@xcite    at criticality or in the qlro phase , the correlation functions of the order parameter exhibit scaling behavior .",
    "in contrast to the models with temperature - like disorder in the models under consideration , the connected and disconnected correlation functions may scale with different exponents .",
    "this reflects metastability and the breaking of the dr .",
    "for instance , the connected two - point function behaves as @xmath59 while the disconnected function scales as @xmath60 here , @xmath61 is the fourier component of the order parameter and the angle brackets stand for the thermal averaging .",
    "schwartz and soffer@xcite proved that the exponents of the rf model obey the inequality @xmath62 . since in the ra case",
    "the coupling to disorder is bilinear , the schwartz - soffer inequality can not be applied directly to @xmath63 and @xmath64 . in the ra case , it is convenient to introduce the correlation functions of the form eqs .",

    "the above results may be relevant for the behavior of @xmath7he in aerogels .",
    "it has recently been observed in nmr experiments that the phase a of @xmath7he confined in aerogel exhibits two different types of magnetic behavior called @xmath227 and @xmath228 states.@xcite depending on the cooling , one can obtain either a nearly pure @xmath227 state or a mixed @xmath229 state , which gives two overlapping lines @xmath227 and @xmath228 in the transverse nmr spectrum .",
    "although the pure @xmath228 state has not been observed , there is an evidence that the @xmath229 state is inhomogeneous and consists of regions with two different magnetic orders @xmath227 and @xmath228.@xcite the order parameter of the @xmath7he - a can be parametrized by the complex vector @xmath230 and the real unit vector @xmath231 , which characterize the orbital and magnetic anisotropy , respectively.@xcite only the orbital part of the order parameter given by the real unit vector @xmath232 $ ] interacts with the aerogel matrix , which can be treated as quenched random anisotropy disorder .",
    "the spin part @xmath231 is not coupled directly to the disorder , but there is a weak spin - orbit ( dipole ) interaction between @xmath233 and @xmath231 which generates the nmr frequency shift . in ref .  , the existence of the two states was interpreted in terms of different `` random textures '' of the field @xmath233 in the larkin - imry - ma state ( qlro phase in our notation ) .",
    "the measured dependencies of the transverse nmr signal on the tipping angle can be explained if one assumes that in the @xmath227 state the vectors @xmath233 and @xmath231 are almost uncorrelated , while in the @xmath228 state they are partially locked .",
    "this is possible if in the @xmath227 state the characteristic length of the texture , i.e. , the larkin length , is much smaller than the characteristic length of the dipole interaction , @xmath234 , while in the @xmath228 state they are of the same order.@xcite however , the nature of different random textures exhibiting different characteristic length scales is not clear .",
    "alternatively , one can try to interpret the @xmath228 state as a network of topological defects pinned by the aerogel.@xcite we argue that these two different states may be the sr and lr qlros found above in the lr ra model .",
    "indeed , aerogel is a porous medium formed by tangled silicon strands which exhibit a fractal mass distribution .",
    "nmr and small - angle x - ray scattering ( saxs ) experiments give the mass - to - distance relation @xmath235 , with the fractal dimensions @xmath236 varying in the range of @xmath237 ",
    "@xmath238 depending on the fabrication process .",
    "this scaling holds up to the fractal correlation length , which can exceed 100 nm.@xcite thus , the effective ra disorder is expected to be long - range correlated with @xmath239 up to the scale of the fractal correlation length or even more.@xcite as a result , the sr qlro phase is unstable to formation of islands with lr qlro ( see fig .  [ fig3-ra ] ) . to compute the larkin length , one has to solve the flow equations ( [ frg-1 ] ) and ( [ frg-2 ] ) starting from a particular bare disorder correlator and looking for the scale at which the cusp is developing .",
    "@xcite we can estimate the larkin length using flory - type arguments.@xcite assuming that @xmath240 is an elastic constant and @xmath86 is a strength of disorder , we obtain @xmath241 and @xmath242 for the sr and lr disorders , respectively . for aerogel , we have @xmath243 and @xmath244 so that the larkin lengths in both phases may differ significantly .",
    "this can explain the experimentally observed coexistence of regions with different spin states .",
    "further investigations , however , are clearly needed .",
    "in this work , we investigated the long distance properties of the @xmath0 model with random fields and random anisotropies correlated as @xmath38 for large separation @xmath2 .",
    "we derived the functional renormalization group equations to one - loop order , which allow us to describe the scaling behavior of the models below and above the lower critical dimension @xmath58 . using a double @xmath3 and @xmath4 expansion",

    "to study the critical behavior above the lower critical dimension is able to give the correct one - loop values of exponents @xmath63 and @xmath64 , but not the phase diagram and the critical exponent @xmath126 except for the region controlled by the weakly nonanalytic lr tt fp .",
    "thus , although the truncated rg overcomes the dimensional reduction , it fails to reproduce all properties which can be obtained using the functional renormalization group .",
    "we found a new lr qlro phase existing in the lr rf model below the lower critical dimension for @xmath183 and determined the regions of its stability in the @xmath245 parameter space .",
    "we obtained that the weak lr correlated disorder does not change the critical behavior of the ra model above @xmath24 for @xmath216 , but can create a new lr qlro phase below @xmath24 .",
    "the existence of two qlro phases in lr ra systems may explain the two different states of @xmath7he - a in aerogel observed recently in nmr experiments.@xcite however , many questions are still open .",
    "in particular , the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transition should exist also for @xmath218 , though it was not found in the one - loop approximation .",
