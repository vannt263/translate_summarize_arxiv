    "orthogonal frequency division multiplexing ( ofdm ) is a digital multi - carrier modulation method that has been widely used in wideband digital communications .",
    "a practical and important application is the downlink phase of a single cell of ofdm - based cellular networks , where the wideband can be divided into a large number of orthogonal sub - carriers , which can be used to carry data for different users . in this system ,",
    "the base station ( bs ) maintains a separate queue to store data packets requested by each user .",
    "when the sub - carrier seen by a user is in good channel condition , the sub - carrier can successfully transmit a packet to the user from its designated queue .",
    "we will focus on the setting of a single - hop multi - user multi - channel system and study the delay performance of this system from a large - deviations perspective . in wireless networks ,",
    "a key problem that has been extensively studied is the design of high - performance scheduling policies .",
    "it is well known from the seminal work @xcite that the maxweight policy is throughput - optimal , in the sense that it can stabilize the system under any feasible arrival rates .",
    "however , it has been shown in @xcite that the maxweight policy sacrifices the delay performance ( and may lead to very large queue lengths ) for better throughput .",
    "this fact has motivated researchers to look for policies that can improve the delay performance measured by a queue - length - based metric . in @xcite",
    ", the authors showed that the maximum - throughput and load - balancing ( mtlb ) policy can achieve delay optimality for two special cases of on / off channels with a two - user system or a system that allows fractional server allocation .",
    "however , this problem becomes much harder in general cases . on the other hand , in cellular networks ,",
    "minimizing average delay may cause a large delay for certain users that have stringent delay requirements .",
    "another line of works focus on designing scheduling policies that maximize the rate - function of the steady - state probability that the largest queue length exceeds a given threshold when the number of channels and users both go to infinity . in @xcite and",
    "@xcite the authors showed that their proposed policy can achieve both throughput optimality and queue length rate - function optimality .",
    "however , simulations in @xcite - @xcite show that good queue length performance does not necessarily imply good delay performance .",
    "in fact , queue - length - based policies usually suffer from the so called `` last packet '' problem , which occurs in the situation where a certain queue has a very small number of packets .",
    "hence , this queue is rarely scheduled by the queue - length - based policies , resulting in large packet delays . to that end",
    ", a delay - based metric has been investigated in recent works in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the authors developed several policies that achieve both throughput optimality and delay rate - function optimality ( or near - optimality ) .",
    "although the results hold for general arrivals ( e.g. , time - correlated arrivals are allowed ) , the channels are assumed to be _ i.i.d . _ over time . in practice ,",
    "the current channel condition could depend on past channel conditions .",
    "therefore , the following important question remains : _ how do we design a low - complexity scheduling policy that achieves provably good throughput and delay performance in the ofdm downlink system with time - correlated channels ?",
    "_ while it is relatively straightforward to develop throughput optimal policies even for time - correlated channels , developing policies that are delay - optimal or delay - efficient for time - correlated channels remains an open problem . to that end",
    ", we are motivated to consider the following question : _ can we find index scheduling policies that are delay - optimal even when the channels are time - correlated ?",
    "_ in this paper , we provide a positive answer in some cases .",
    "specifically , we analyze the delay rate - function of the class of _ oldest packets first _",
    "( opf ) policies which give a higher priority to packets with a large delay and present two conditions under which delay rate - function optimality can be achieved by any opf policy .",
    "the key contributions of this paper are summarized as follows .",
    "we use an alternating renewal process to model a general on / off time - correlated channel .",
    "we first prove an upper bound on the delay rate - function for any scheduling policy .",
    "then , we analyze the delay rate - function of the class of opf policies , which give a higher priority to older packets .",
    "we present two conditions and show that if both conditions are satisfied , delay rate - function optimality can be achieved by any opf policy .",
    "the first condition requires that the channel condition is _ non - negatively correlated _ over time .",
    "this is often observed in practical time - correlated channels .",
    "the second condition requires that the `` off '' period distribution has the memoryless property , whereas the `` on '' period distribution could be arbitrary .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section [ model ] , we describe the system model and the performance metric . in section [ upper_bound ] , we derive an upper bound on the rate - function for any possible policy , and in section [ analysis ] , we obtain an achievable rate - function of the class of opf policies",
    ". then in section [ relationship ] , we propose two conditions that imply delay rate - function optimality of the class of opf policies .",
    "we conduct simulations to validate our theoretical results in section [ simulation ] and make concluding remarks in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "we use a time - slotted multi - queue multi - server system to model the downlink phase of a single cell ofdm system .",
    "in particular , we assume that there are @xmath0 servers which stand for frequency sub - carriers .",
    "furthermore , we assume the number of users is equal to the number of channels for ease of presentation @xcite .",
    "the base station maintains a queue / buffer to store packets requested by each user , hence there are also @xmath0 queues in the queueing system .",
    "( we use terms `` server '' and `` channel '' , `` queue '' and `` user '' interchangeably throughout this paper . )",

    ". finally , we use @xmath10 to denote the indicator function that indicates whether event @xmath11 occurs or not .     and",

    "let @xmath12 denote the number of packet arrivals to queue @xmath1 in time - slot @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath13 denote the total packet arrivals coming into the system in time - slot @xmath7 , and let @xmath14 denote the cumulative packet arrivals to the system from time - slot @xmath15 to time - slot @xmath16 .",
    "next , we will introduce several assumptions on the arrival process for purpose of rate - function delay analysis .",
    "_ * assumption 1 : * _ the number of arrivals are bounded , i.e. , there exists a finite number @xmath17 such that @xmath18 for any @xmath2 and @xmath7 .",
    "also , we assume @xmath19 for any @xmath20 and @xmath0 .    _ * assumption 2 : * _ the arrival process are i.i.d across all users , and the mean arrival rate is @xmath21 ( we assume @xmath22 , otherwise the system could not be stable under any scheduling policy ) for every user .",
    "given any @xmath23 and @xmath24 , there exists a positive function @xmath25 independent of @xmath0 and @xmath7 such that @xmath26 for all @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "assumptions 1 and 2 are mild .",
    "packet arrivals per time - slot are typically bounded in practice .",
    "in addition , it has been shown in @xcite that assumption 2 is a general result of the statistical multiplexing effect of a large number of sources and holds for both _",
    "_ arrivals and markov chain driven arrivals .",
    "we assume that each channel has unit capacity and changes between  on \" state and  off \" state from time to time .",

    "we use an alternating renewal process to model the stochastic connectivity . in other words",

    "in this section , we aim to derive a non - trivial achievable delay rate - function of the class of opf policies .",

    "since the channel has different behaviors ( distributions ) for state - change and state - keeping . to address this key challenge , we prove two important properties of the fbs policy and the perfect - matching policy ( section iv.a ) , which will play a key role in the proof .",
    "we start by briefly describing the operations of the fbs policy and the perfect - matching policy .    under the fbs policy",
    ", packets are served in unit of frames .",
    "each frame is constructed according to a given operating parameter @xmath158 , such that : 1 ) the difference of the arrival times of any two packets within a frame must be no greater than @xmath158 ; and 2 ) the total number of packets in each frame is no greater than @xmath159 . in each time - slot",

    "otherwise , no packet will be served . in any time - slot",
    ", the fbs policy serves the hol frame that contains the oldest ( up to @xmath160 ) packets with high probability for a large @xmath0 . under the perfect - matching policy ,",
    "if a perfect matching can be found , i.e. , every queue can be matched with a different server that is connected to this queue , the hol packet of every queue will be served by the respective server determined by the perfect matching .",
    "otherwise , none of the packets will be served .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that any opf policy dominates the fbs policy and the perfect - matching policy , i.e. , given the same packet arrivals and channel realization , any opf policy will serve every packet that the fbs policy has served up to time @xmath7 ; and the same for the perfect - matching policy .",
    "therefore , the fbs and perfect - matching policy will provide lower bounds on the delay rate - function that any opf policy can achieve .      in this subsection",
