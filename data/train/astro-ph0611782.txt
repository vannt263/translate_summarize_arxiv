    "the complexity of the traditional formalism for describing the earth s rotation is frustrating . even in the community of professional astronomers a complete understanding of the procedure of applying reduction for the earth s rotation in all details is not common , especially of the last iau  2000 , iau  2006 recommendations @xcite .",
    "however , reduction for the earth s rotation is not only a subject of academic interest , but is the area for various important applications .",
    "the complexity of the formalism increases the probability of misunderstanding .",
    "misunderstanding significantly increases the risk of an error in a software which implements reductions . in the worst case scenario , for instance ,",
    "a glitch in a navigation equipment of a passenger aircraft controlled by such a program may result in a wreck and loss of life .",
    "that is why it is vitally important to simplify description of the earth s rotation for end users .",
    "an alternative approach for describing the earth rotation was proposed by @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated that instead of using a very complex mathematical model for the a  priori rotation matrix and time series of the earth orientation parameters which correct that a  priori rotation matrix , it is feasible to represent the earth s rotation in a form of a sum of a very simple , coarse a  priori mathematical model and a set of coefficients of expansion of the perturbational rotation into the fourier and b - spline bases which are estimated from observations .    in this paper",
    "the implications of the alternative approach with respect to the traditional approach , its advantages and limitations , are discussed .",
    "space geodesy techniques , such as gps , slr , doris and vlbi allow to measure the time intervals or the differences of time intervals of electromagnetic wave propagation from observed bodies to observing stations .",
    "solutions of differential equations of wave propagation ties position vectors of observed bodies and their time derivatives with position vector of observing bodies and their time derivatives .",
    "therefore , a relative motion of observing stations with respect to observed bodies can be determined from analysis of observations .",
    "since the observing stations are fixed with respect to the earth s crust , it is convenient to express their positions in a terrestrial coordinate system in which a motion of stations would be small , an order of magnitude of earth s crust deformation , i.e. @xmath0 . a time - independent reference position vector in such a coordinate system , @xmath1 is determined via the following linear transformation : @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the reference position vector in celestial coordinate system , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the time - dependent a  priori and empirical station displacement vectors , @xmath6 is the a  priori rotation matrix , @xmath7 is the empirical small vector of perturbational rotation .",
    "it should be noted that such a transformation does not determine coordinates of position vectors in the terrestrial coordinate system uniquely .",
    "equation [ e:01 ] should be accompanied with the vector equation of additional boundary conditions : @xmath8 where summing is performed over all stations of the network .",
    "the rotation matrix @xmath6 and its perturbation @xmath7 can be considered as the matrix of earth s rotation if a ) the relative motion of stations with respect to the local areas of the earth s crust is negligible ; b ) the reference positions of observed bodies are at reset in an inertial coordinate system .",
    "thus , the earth s rotation is defined here as a net rotation of a polyhedron of reference positions of observing stations with respect to a polyhedron of reference positions of observed bodies .",
    "this definition of the earth s rotation follows the materialistic approach : `` the earth s rotation is that what * is observed * '' .",
    "the currently prevailing paradigm tends to consider this phenomena from the idealistic point of view , which involves considering a relative motion of celestial spheres , one of which represents the ideal earth and another represents the sky ( refer to @xcite more details ) .",
    "that approach operates such notions as big circles , poles , axes , ecliptic , true equator of date etc . , and follows the tradition which can be traced back to ancient greece @xcite .",
    "this concept has a mechanical interpretation of a rolling and sliding poinsot s cones @xcite .",
    "however , this concept is not adequate when one needs to describe the earth s rotation with an accuracy comparable to the precision of modern observations , i.e. @xmath9  rad .",
    "first , the earth can not be considered as a rigid body , and a notion of the rotation axis , i.e. a set of points to which a distance from any point that belongs to the body does not change with time , is not applicable any more .",
    "second , the presence of high frequency variations in the earth s rotation , others than retrograde diurnal terms , makes the poinsot s interpretation inadequate .",
    "thirdly , the complexity of the mathematical model  the so - call mhb2000 expansion @xcite consists of more than one thousand separate motions  makes a meaningful interpretation problematic , similar to the situation of description of the planetary motion in terms of ptolemy s epicycles .",
    "since both @xmath10 and vector @xmath11 are functions of time , i.e. infinite sets of points , their evaluation from a finite set of observations can be performed only in the form of representing them via some functions . the choice of these functions we call a mathematical model .",
    "the model depends on a finite set of unknown parameters which are determined from observations .",
    "the fundamental problem is that no observation technique , except the laser gyroscope , is sensitive to the instantaneous earth s rotation vector or its time derivatives _",
    "directly_. the rotation angles can be derived using the least square estimation procedure together with evaluation of other parameters , and it requires the accumulation of the sufficient amount of data in order to separate variables .",
    "the estimates of the earth s rotation angles can not be sampled too fast .",
    "a typical sampling rate of estimates is one day , since this allows compensation of a certain type of systematic errors . in some cases the sampling rate",
    "can be reduced to several hours .",
    "a careful examination of the traditional approach first proposed by @xcite , reveals three mathematical models @xcite : 1 ) the a  priori model , 2 ) the estimation model , and 3 ) the post - processing model .",
    "corrections to rotation angles around coordinate axes @xmath12 are parameterized in the form equivalent to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the earth s angular velocity .",
    "this estimation model is not adequate for a long period of time .",
    "usually parameters @xmath15 are determined for a given 24  hour period .",
    "then the time series of @xmath16 are filtered and smoothed .",
    "the coefficients of the interpolating spline are computed using the smoothed time series of these parameters .",
    "this interpolating spline for continuous functions @xmath17 defined at the entire interval of observations forms the post - processing model .",
    "the a  priori rotation matrix @xmath6 is represented as a product of 12 elementary rotations around coordinate axes .",
    "some angles of these rotations depend on functions @xmath17 from the post - processing model .",
    "the traditional approach has certain disadvantages .",
    "the three mathematical models involved contradict each other .",
    "the parameter estimation is not optimal : the raw time series minimizes residuals in the least square sense , but the filtered and smoothed series does not ; if it did , no smoothing would have been needed .",
    "the estimation model [ e:03 ] has a very small range of validity . in order to compensate its coarseness , a very refined and sophisticated a  priori model",
    "is required .",
    "it should be accurate at a very high level .",
    "small changes in the a  priori model results in changes not only adjustments , but in total earth orientation parameters due to inadequacy of the estimation model [ e:03 ] . to demonstrate it ,",
    "a series of vlbi solutions was made .",
    "the first reference solution , gsf2006d[multiblock footnote omitted ] , used as a  priori the usno final time series of pole coordinates and ut1 with the time span of 1  day[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "eight parameters , @xmath15 , were estimated for each 24  hour observing session independently . in the second solution the gaussian noise with the standard deviation 1  nrad was added to the usno finals eop . in other trial solutions",
    "the gaussian noise was passed through the rectangular low - pass digital filter with the frequency cutoffs which correspond to periods of 3 , 7 , 10 and 15 days .",
    "the noise was re - scaled in order to have the standard deviation of 1  nrad in all cases .",
    "the rms of the differences in _ totals _ , the sum of apriori and adjustments , with respect to the reference solution are presented in table  [ t : t1 ] .",
    ".the rms of the differences in total eop of solutions with a  priori time series with added gaussian noise with respect to the reference solution in nrad .",
    "the gaussian noise was passed though the rectangular filter which cut the frequencies that corresponding periods shorter than a threshold .",
    "the rms of the noise was 1  nrad in all cases . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t : t2 ]    in order to validate the estimates of the harmonic variations of the perturbational rotation vector , a trial solution following the traditional earth rotation parameterization and the a  priori empirical model of the earth rotation from the previous solution was run .",
    "the rms of adjustments of nutation angles over 1996.02006.0 with respect to the apriori mhb2000 expansion  @xcite was 0.98  nrad and 0.39  nrad with respect to the empirical earth rotation model .",
    "it was demonstrated that the empirical earth rotation model can be determined directly from observations over a period of 22 years using the least square estimation technique .",
    "the advantage of the proposed approach is that a continuous function describing the earth s orientation is determined in one step without producing intermediate time series .",
    "another advantage of the proposed approach is that a simplified a  priori model with only 31 numerical parameters is sufficient , while according to the traditional approach a complicated a  priori model of precession , nutation , high frequency harmonic variations of the earth s rotation and a filtered and smoothed time series of the earth orientation parameters produced in the previous analysis , in total @xmath18 numerical parameters @xcite , is needed .",
    "the proposed approach is conceptually much more simple than the traditional approach , since it does not operate with idealistic notions that are not observable , such as the non - rotating origin , the equinox , various intermediate poles , axes , etc .",
    "it was demonstrated that the empirical earth rotation model derived from analysis of vlbi observations gives the differences with respect to the eop derived from analysis of independent gps observations at moments of observation at the same level , within 20% , as the differences of the vlbi eop series produced with the traditional approach .",
    "the advantage of the proposed approach is that the estimates of the eop rates are by a factor of 1.52.0 closer to the gps time series than the vlbi eop rates estimated following the traditional approach .",
    "the rms of estimates of residual nutation angles with respect to the empirical earth rotation model is 2.6 times smaller than the residuals with respect to the mhb2000 expansion ."
