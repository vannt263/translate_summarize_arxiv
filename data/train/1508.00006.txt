    "the instability of capillary interfaces has long been an intriguing topic in fluid mechanics .",
    "perhaps one of the earliest investigated interfacial instability phenomena is the rayleigh - taylor instability , where a denser fluid located above a lighter one protrudes into the latter due to any arbitrary small perturbation of the initially flat interface .",
    "however , this protrusion is not always observed when a droplet rises or sediments into another density - contrasted fluid . according to  @xcite and  @xcite ,",
    "a spherical translating droplet is a solution of this problem in the stokes regime , regardless of the presence or magnitude of the surface tension . what remains unknown , however , is the existence of other equilibrium shapes of the droplet and the influence of surface tension on the stability of the spherical solution .",
    "experiments were conducted by  @xcite to examine this issue .",
    "two patterns of shape instability were observed : depending on the viscosity ratio @xmath0 , a protrusion or an indentation at the rear of droplet was seen to grow with time .",
    "@xcite also performed a linear stability analysis assuming that the droplet underwent small deformations .",
    "a linear operator depending on the viscosity ratio @xmath0 and capillary number @xmath1 ( inversely scaling with the surface tension ) was derived which governs the linearised droplet shape evolution .",
    "it was found that , irrespective of the value of @xmath1 , i.e. even for arbitrary small surface tension , the eigenvalues of the operator had negative real part , pointing to a linearly stable shape .",
    "the authors recognized that this linear stability study contradicted their experiments showing instabilities with finite surface tension ; direct numerical simulations ( dns )  @xcite also reported the unstable shape evolution of slightly disturbed droplets in the presence of sufficient surface tension ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "recent numerical work has examined the effect of surfactants  @xcite and viscoelasticity  @xcite on this scenario .",
    "the contradiction between the theory and experiments / dns is somewhat reminiscent of the case of the fingering instability of a film flowing down an inclined plane : the experimentally - measured  @xcite critical inclination angle triggering instability was found to be well below that obtained from the linear theory .",
    "@xcite discovered that the traditional spectrum analysis failed to capture the short - time but significant energy amplification of the perturbations near the contact line .",
    "they pinpointed the missing mechanism by performing a so - called non - modal analysis , borrowed from the transient growth theory founded and developed in the early @xmath3s for hydrodynamic stability analysis  @xcite , to identify and interpret the short - time energy amplification .",
    "the non - modal tools of stability theory have been used to explain the discrepancies between the theoretically computed critical reynolds number and the experimentally - observed counterpart in a variety of wall - bounded shear flows  @xcite . the traditional eigenvalue analysis as also used in  @xcite , i.e. the so - called modal approach , can sometimes fail to interpret real flow dynamics as the spectrum of the linear operator only dictates the asymptotic fate of the perturbations _ without _ considering their _ short - term _ dynamics  @xcite .",
    "the non - modal analysis , in contrast , is able to capture the short - time perturbation characteristics and determine the most dangerous initial conditions leading to the optimal energy growth .",
    "in addition to its great success in the traditional hydrodynamic stability analysis , it has been also used to elucidate complex flow instability problems including capillary interfaces  @xcite , thermal - acoustic interactions  @xcite and viscoelasticity  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "this is also reflected from the initial shapes : as @xmath149/@xmath152 , the optimal shape shares a common feature with an oblate / prolate ellipsoid , namely its rear interface is compressed / stretched .",
    "to explain the dependence of the instability patterns on the viscosity ratio @xmath0 , let us focus on the velocity field near the tail of the droplet ( see figure  [ fig : flowfield ] ) , where the flow resembles a uniaxial extensional flow , drawing the tip into the drop on the top side and pulling it outwards on the other side .",
    "we suggest that this imbalance induces the onset of the shape instability .",
    "the internal ( respectively external ) viscous force on the tip is @xmath167 ( respectively @xmath168 ) .",
    "when @xmath169 , i.e. @xmath149 , the external viscous effect overcomes the internal one , hence the perturbation tends to be stretched outward to form a protrusion ; otherwise , when @xmath152 , it is prone to be sucked inwards to form an indentation .",
    "developed originally for hydrodynamic stability analysis , non - modal tools have here demonstrated the predictive capacity for the inertialess shape instabilities of capillary interfaces .",
    "this work might stimulate the application of non - modal analysis for complex multiphase flow instabilities even at low reynolds number .",
