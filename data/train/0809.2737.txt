    "the helical symmetry of the dna is almost always neglected when modeling the charge transport through the dna - based devices : a dna is usually considered as a flat ladder - like sequence ( periodic or stochastic ) of base pairs  @xcite .",
    "very recently the intrinsic helix conformation of the dna strands was put forward as the key ingredient allowing for control of the electric current through the molecule by the electric field perpendicular to the dna axis  @xcite . in the presence of such a field",
    "the helical conformation leads to an additional periodic modulation of the base pair energies , which affects strongly the charge transport through the dna . on this basis ,",
    "prototypes of the single - dna - based field effect transistor and the esaki diode analogue have been proposed  @xcite .    in this contribution , we aim to further exploit the symmetry of the dna molecules and demonstrate , by means of numerical simulations , that ( i ) - a single dry periodic dna molecule ( such as the ploy(g)-poly(c ) ) subjected to a collinear uniform electric field can exhibit bloch oscillations  @xcite and ( ii ) - because of the helical conformation , the oscillations become more complex in the presence of the perpendicular ( gating ) electric field .",
    "the frequency of these oscillations falls in the thz domain , the region which is in the focus of an intense research nowadays ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent overview ) .",
    "the above - mentioned property provides therefore for a possibility to design a dna - based tunable thz oscillator .",
    "bloch  @xcite and zener  @xcite argued on the theoretical grounds that an electron , moving in an ideal periodic potential and subjected to a uniform electric field @xmath0 , is confined within a finite region because of the bragg reflection .",
    "due to the confinement , it undergoes a periodic motion which is characterized by the angular frequency @xmath1 and a spatial extension @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the electron charge , @xmath0 is the applied electric field , @xmath4 is the lattice constant , and @xmath5 stands for the band width ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    for simplicity , we consider here a single - stranded uniform poly(g )",
    "helix for which we assume the conformation parameters of the double - stranded dna ( dsdna ) in its b form , in particular , the full - twist period of 10 base molecules . for a periodic dsdna , such as the poly(g)-poly(c ) , the picture of bloch oscillations is more complicated as compared to the considered case , however , the physics is very similar .",
    "we use the _ minimum _ tight - binding model , extending it to include a uniform electric field @xmath6 that is tilted by the angle @xmath7 with respect to the axis of the helix .",
    "the field has therefore both the collinear component , @xmath8 , and the lateral ( gating ) one , @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian of our model in site representation reads : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 is the state vector of the @xmath12-th base molecule and the corresponding energy @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the site energy of the @xmath12-th base molecule at zero field .",
    "we assume all molecules to be the same , so we set the unperturbed energies @xmath15 to zero from now on .",
    "the term @xmath16 describes the linear potential along the helix axes ; the potential drop across a base molecule in the stacking direction is @xmath17 , where @xmath4 is the nearest - neighbor distance along the helix axis , @xmath18 is the potential drop across the helix in the perpendicular direction , @xmath19 nm being the helix radius .",

    "( [ h ] ) describes the transfer interaction between the nearest - neighbor bases ; it is chosen to be positive which implies that the considered charge is a hole  @xcite",
    ". the parallel component of the electric field , @xmath22 , yields the potential ramp along the stacking direction , which sets the frequency of the bloch oscillations , as in the traditional case .",
    "however , eq .  ( [ e ] ) shows that the helix in the lateral field acquires the additional periodic modulation of the potential .",
    "this modulation leads to the modification of the electronic structure of the system : the bare energy band splits into several different minibands , which is crucial for the charge transport properties  @xcite .",
    "each such miniband has its own bloch frequency , resulting in a more complex overall picture of bloch oscillations as we show below .",
    "the amplitude of the periodic modulation is controlled by the magnitude of the perpendicular component of the electric field , @xmath9 , providing for a mechanism to alter the fundamental properties of the system .",
    "we further solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( the planck constant @xmath23 ) @xmath24 for an electron wave packet @xmath25 being initially a narrow gaussian centered at an arbitrary lattice site @xmath26 : @xmath27}\\ , \\label{gaussian}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the normalization constant .",

    "the motion of the centroid represents simple harmonic oscillations with the period @xmath39 and the amplitude @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the bandwidth , which is in full correspondence with the standard picture of bloch oscillations in a linear chain .",
    "the helical symmetry does not affect the oscillations at @xmath42 .    on turning on the gating field , @xmath43 , , the motion of the centroid still manifests an oscillatory behavior , however , a more complicated one as compared to simple harmonic oscillations ( fig .",
