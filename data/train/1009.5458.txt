    "over the past decade , model theories in which our @xmath0 space - time ( brane ) embedded as a hyper - surface in a higher dimensional space - time ( bulk ) have been proposed and opened a large , relatively unexplored area of research .",
    "the interest in the study of gravity in spaces with extra dimensions started to grow rapidly with the appearance of the proposal put forward by randall and sundrum ( rs ) @xcite .",
    "this was followed by the derivation of the einstein field equations on the brane through the use of the gauss - codazzi equations and israel junction conditions together with the assumption of @xmath1 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the cosmological consequences of this work , such as the additional quadratic density term in the friedman equations @xcite have been widely investigated .    although use of the israel junction conditions together with @xmath1 symmetry is the widely accepted method amongst the workers in the field for confining the gauge fields to the brane and hence obtaining the field equation , there has been concerns expressed over their use in that such junction conditions may not be unique @xcite .",
    "another point to note is that if more than one extra dimension is involved , there is , as yet , no way of obtaining viable junction conditions .",
    "eying such concerns , an interesting model which avoids the above questions was proposed in @xcite . here , the confinement of the gauge fields to the brane is done by postulating the existence of a confining potential @xmath2 .",
    "one then obtains the field equations on the brane without the use of any junction conditions or the assumption of @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "the field equations obtained in this way contain a term , @xmath3 , which is an independently conserved quantity and geometrical in nature .",
    "this would allow us to attribute it to what is known as the x - matter .",
    "the dynamics of test particles confined to such a brane - world at the classical and quantum levels was studied in @xcite .",
    "the static , spherically symmetric solutions of this model was used subsequently to explain the galaxy rotation curves @xcite .",
    "various other cosmological implication of the model were also studied and showed to be consistent with observations , such as the late time accelerated expansion of the universe which is related to dark energy content of the universe . @xcite .",
    "one of the important observation which necessitates the existence of dark matter is the so - called virial mass discrepancy .",
    "the total mass of a cluster of galaxies can be estimated in two ways . knowing the motions of its member galaxies , the virial theorem gives one estimate @xmath4 .",
    "the second estimate is obtained by taking the mass of the individual galaxies separately and adding them up to give @xmath5 . almost without any exception ,",
    "the virial mass @xmath4 is greater than the total baryonic mass @xmath5 by 20 - 30% @xcite , so that the existence of dark matter is assumed in order to explain this discrepancy . in @xcite , this effect",
    "is explained within a rs type brane - world together with the fact that the electric part of the weyl tensor can be decomposed irreducibly into dark matter energy density and pressure , previously presented in @xcite .",
    "the virial mass discrepancy is explained in @xcite for a brane - world model theory discussed above , and also in the context of dgp brane gravity @xcite .",
    "recent observations show that the tangential velocity of stars moving around the center of a galaxy tend to a constant value as we move away from the center of the galaxy . in order to explain",
    "such rotation curves various suggestions have been made .",
    "for example , in @xcite modified newtonian dynamics is used to explain the stability of circular orbits , while in @xcite the authors use conformal symmetry in the context of brane - world gravity to explain the constancy of galaxy rotation curves . in this paper",
    "we present similar conclusions within the context of the brane - world scenario proposed here by invoking the notion of conformal killing symmetry .",
    "calculation of the geometrical term obtained in this model needs the specification of the bulk geometry .",
    "one may then compute the tensor @xmath3 using the gauss - codazzi equation . in the case that the bulk geometry is unknown , one of the components of the extrinsic curvature tensor is left arbitrary , which may then be obtained using the einstein field equations @xcite . in this paper",
    "however , we use this arbitrariness and consider the geometric tensor @xmath3 as a perfect fluid for which the energy density and pressure is obtained via the einstein field equations . as is shown in the sections below , the following two problems related to dark matter can be explained using different geometrical matter .",
    "the galaxy rotation curves can be accounted for by defining the tensor @xmath3 to be anisotropic with the equation of state of the form ( [ eqs ] ) .",
    "the virial mass discrepancy can be explained by introducing the isotropic geometrical matter .",
    "this choice however is somewhat expected in that the virial mass problem concerns the calculation of the mass of the cluster of galaxies which is a much larger object than the galaxy itself .",
    "the scope of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we obtain the virial mass theorem in the context of the brane - world model discussed above . in section three the equation of state of the x - matter",
    "is obtained with the specific choice of the energy momentum tensor of the x - matter .",
    "section four concerns the galaxy rotation curves where we show that the constancy of the velocity is obtained by the assumption that the brane admits a conformal symmetry .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section five .",
    "we use the einstein field equations obtained in @xcite in the context of brane - world models without the @xmath1 symmetry . neglecting the global bulk effects",
    ", the einstein equations read @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy - momentum tensor of the ordinary matter on the brane and @xmath3 is a conserved geometric quantity which can be considered as an energy - momentum of the x - matter . in this section",
    "we obtain the generalized virial theorem and show that the x - matter mass is linearly related to the virial mass .",
    "we take the brane spherically symmetric and static metric as @xmath8 for @xmath7 , we take @xmath9 while for the x - matter we choose a fluid of the form @xmath10 now , substituting the equations above in equation ( [ eq11 ] ) we obtain the following field equations on the brane @xmath11 where the last equation is obtained from @xmath12 and a prime represents derivative with respect to @xmath13 .    in order to obtain the virial theorem ,",
    "it is convenient to work in tetrad formalism .",
    "let us then define the following frame of orthonormal vectors @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and the tetrad indices are indicated by the parenthesis . in tetrad components",
    "the 4-velocity @xmath16 of a typical galaxy , with the property @xmath17 , is given by @xmath18 finally we introduce @xmath19 as the distribution function of galaxies assumed to be identical and collisionless point particles .",
    "the relativistic boltzmann equation in tetrad components is now given by @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the ricci rotation coefficients .",
    "for our choice of the metric , the boltzmann equation becomes @xmath22 where @xmath23 if we assume that the coordinate dependence of the distribution function is only through @xmath13 , equation ( [ eq22 ] ) reduces to @xmath24 the spherically symmetric nature of the metric requires that the coefficient of @xmath25 be zero .",
    "now , multiplying equation ( [ eq24 ] ) by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is an invariant volume element in the velocity space and @xmath28 is the mass of the galaxy , and integrating over the velocity space and assuming that @xmath29 vanishes sufficiently rapidly as the velocities tend to @xmath30 , we obtain @xmath31+\\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\left[\\left < v^2_t\\right>+ \\left < v^2_r\\right>\\right]r\\mu^\\prime -\\rho\\left[\\left < v^2_\\theta\\right>+\\left < v^2_\\varphi\\right>-2\\left < v^2_r\\right>\\right]=0,\\label{eq25}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the mass density , and @xmath33 represents the average value of the quantity it contains .",
    "multiplying equation ( [ eq25 ] ) by @xmath34 and integrating over the cluster of galaxies , we obtain @xmath35r^2dr+ \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^r 4\\pi r^3\\rho\\left[\\left < v^2_t\\right>+\\left < v^2_r\\right>\\right]\\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial r}dr=0.\\label{eq26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the total kinetic energy of the galaxies is given by @xmath36r^2dr,\\label{eq27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that equation ( [ eq26 ] ) reduces to @xmath37\\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial r}d r. \\label{eq28}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in terms of the distribution function we can write the energy momentum tensor @xmath7 as @xcite @xmath38 leading to @xmath39 now , by adding the minus of equation ( [ eq15 ] ) to equation ( [ eq16 ] ) and adding twice of equation ( [ eq17 ] ) to the result we obtain @xmath40 where we have defined @xmath41 .",
    "let us now see what kind of approximations we can make in this formalism .",
    "first , we assume that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are small so that we can neglect the quadratic terms in equation ( [ eq31 ] ) .",
    "second , we assume that the galaxies have velocities much smaller than the speed of light , so @xmath44 . these conditions can be applied to test particles in stable circular motion around galaxies and to the galactic clusters .",
    "equation ( [ eq31 ] ) is then reduced to @xmath45 to go any further , we need to specify the equation of the state for the x - matter which we assume to have the following form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an arbitrary constant . equation ( [ eq32 ] ) is therefore reduced to @xmath48 multiplying equation ( [ eq34 ] ) by @xmath49 and integrating from @xmath50 to @xmath13 we obtain @xmath51 where we have defined @xmath52 and @xmath53 finally , multiplying equation ( [ eq35 ] ) by @xmath54 and integrating from @xmath50 to @xmath55 and using equation ( [ eq28 ] ) we obtain @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 is the moment of inertia of the system .",
    "equation ( [ eq38 ] ) is the generalized virial theorem on the brane in the presence of the brane cosmological constant and x - matter . if @xmath59 , equation ( [ eq38 ] ) reduces to the virial theorem with a cosmological constant @xcite . in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath60 . in order to obtain the ratio of the x - matter mass to the virial mass",
    ", we introduce the following radii @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the virial radius and @xmath63 is the radius defined by the x - matter .",
    "if we define the virial mass as @xmath64 and use the following relations @xmath65 the generalized virial theorem ( [ eq38 ] ) reduces to @xmath66 since the contribution of a cosmological constant to the mass of the galaxy is several order of magnitude smaller than the observed mass , we can neglect it in equation ( [ eq47 ] ) .",
    "moreover we can neglect the unity in ( [ eq47 ] ) since @xmath4 is much greater than @xmath5 for most galaxies .",
    "therefore , the virial mass in our model is given by @xmath67 showing that the virial mass is proportional to the x - matter mass .      in this section",
    "we obtain @xmath68 as a function of @xmath13 and consequently see that the solution is linearly increasing with @xmath13 , pointing to a possible explanation of the mass discrepancy in clusters of galaxies .",
    "we start with einstein equations ( [ eq15])-([eq18 ] ) and since most of the baryonic mass in clusters is in the gas form , we assume that the effective energy - density and pressure in @xmath7 is that of a gas and therefore set @xmath69    in majority of clusters most of the baryonic mass is in the form of the intra - cluster gas .",
    "the gas density @xmath70 can be fitted with the observational data by using the following radial baryonic mass distribution @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the core radius , and @xmath73 and @xmath74 are cluster independent constants",
    ". a static spherically symmetric system of collisionless particles that is in equilibrium , can be described by the jean s equation @xcite @xmath75+\\frac{2\\rho_g(r)}{r}\\left(\\sigma^2_r- \\sigma^2_{\\theta,\\varphi}\\right)= -\\rho_g(r)\\frac{d\\phi}{dr},\\label{eq64}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the gravitational potential , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the mass - weighted velocity dispersions , respectively , in the radial and tangential directions .",
    "we assume that the gas is isotropically distributed inside the cluster , so @xmath79 .",
    "the gas pressure is related to the velocity dispersion and gas density by @xmath80 . by assumption that the gravitational field is weak so that it satisfies the usual poisson equation @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the energy density including @xmath70 and other forms of matter , like luminous matter and the x - matter , etc .",
    ", the jean s equation becomes @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the total mass inside the radius @xmath13 .",
    "the observed x - ray emission from the hot ionized intra - cluster gas is usually interpreted by assuming that the gas is in isothermal equilibrium .",
    "so we assume that the gas is in equilibrium state having the equation of state @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the mean atomic weight of the particles in the gas cluster , and @xmath87 is the proton s mass .",
    "equation ( [ eq65 ] ) then becomes @xmath88 where the second equality is obtained using equation ( [ eq63 ] ) .",
    "using equations ( [ eq36 ] ) and ( [ eq37 ] ) we can obtain another expression for @xmath89 @xmath90 combining equations ( [ eq67 ] ) and ( [ eq68 ] ) we obtain the following expression for @xmath91 @xmath92.\\label{eq69}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the regime @xmath93 , equation ( [ eq69 ] ) is reduced to @xmath94\\frac{1}{r^2},\\label{eq70}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and by equation ( [ eq37 ] ) we obtain @xmath95r.\\label{eq71}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now consider the limit of large @xmath13 . for most clusters",
    "the parameter @xmath74 has the value @xmath96 @xcite . because of the smallness of the second term in ( [ eq71 ] ) in this case , we have @xmath97 as can be seen , the x - matter mass increases linearly with @xmath13 and this is similar to the behavior of dark matter in the cluster of galaxies . let us now make some estimates . first we note that @xmath98 for most clusters . the virial radius of clusters is usually assumed to be @xmath99 , indicating the radius for which the energy density @xmath100 of the cluster becomes @xmath101 , where @xmath102 @xcite .",
    "we can estimate the critical radius of the x - matter by determining the distance in which the x - matter density is equal to @xmath103 . using ( [ eq70 ] ) and noting that the last term may be dropped in our limit we find @xmath104 we then have @xmath105 for @xmath106 the x - matter mass has a maximum at @xmath107 the maximum value of the x - matter mass is given by @xmath108",
    "in this section we find the vacuum solutions of the theory and obtain the equation of motion of the x - matter . assuming that @xmath109 , the effective vacuum equation ( [ eq11 ] ) is reduced to @xmath110 let us assume that @xmath3 has the form of an anisotropic perfect fluid @xmath111 with an equation of state @xmath112 taking metric ( [ eq12 ] ) , the vacuum field equations on the brane become @xmath113 the equations above contain 4 unknown quantities so that an extra relation would be desirable . such an equation can be provided by assuming that the brane admits a one parameter group of conformal motions so that @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the conformal factor and @xmath116 represents the lie derivative .",
    "moreover , we assume the following general form for the vector field @xmath117 @xmath118 use of equation ( [ 1eq32 ] ) then leads to @xmath119 @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 in order to solve these equations , we see from equation ( [ 1eq37 ] ) that @xmath125 where we have set the arbitrary separation constant equal to zero ( this can be done easily by shifting @xmath126 by a constant ) and @xmath127 is an arbitrary function . from equation ( [ 1eq36 ] )",
    "we have @xmath128 which , upon using equation ( [ 1eq34 ] ) , we obtain @xmath129 where @xmath130 is an arbitrary separation constant and @xmath131 is some other constant .",
    "now , using equation ( [ 1eq38 ] ) we obtain @xmath132 where @xmath133 is some arbitrary function . since @xmath134 is a killing vector field we can set @xmath135 without loss of generality , so that the form of the conformal killing vector field @xmath117 is given by @xmath136\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\varphi}.\\label{1eq44}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , from equations ( [ 1eq34 ] ) and ( [ 1eq35 ] ) we can write the metric components in terms of the conformal factor @xmath137,\\label{1eq45}\\\\ & e^{\\nu(r)}=\\frac{b^2}{\\phi^2},\\label{1eq46}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are arbitrary integration constants . upon substitution of these equations into the field equations ( [ 1eq29])-([1eq31 ] ) we obtain the following system of equations for @xmath115 , @xmath91 and @xmath140 @xmath141",
    "assuming @xmath142 and equating equations ( [ 1eq47 ] ) and ( [ 1eq48 ] ) we obtain @xmath143 now , if one expresses @xmath13 in terms of @xmath126 , one finds @xmath144 where @xmath145 is an integration constant and @xmath146 is defined as @xmath147\\right\\}. \\label{sol2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy density and pressure of the x - matter can now be obtained in terms of @xmath126 @xmath148 and @xmath149 the equation of state of the x - matter can be obtained from equations ( [ 1eq54 ] ) and ( [ 1eq55 ] ) @xmath150 we see that in the limit @xmath151 the x - matter has an equation of state @xmath152 .",
    "the results of the previous section is in agreement with the observed behavior of the tangential velocity of galaxies ; we know from observations that the rotational velocities increase almost linearly from the center of a galaxy and approaches a constant value of about @xmath153 as one moves away from the center @xcite . in this section",
    "we consider the tangential velocity of a test particle which moves in a circular time - like geodesic orbit .",
    "the lagrangian of the system is given by @xcite @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the affine parameter along the geodesic . from equation ( [ 1eq58 ] ) we find that the energy @xmath156 , the @xmath157 component of the angular momentum of the particle @xmath158 , where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath155 and the total angular momentum of the particle @xmath159 are conserved quantities . the total angular momentum of the particle can be written in terms of the solid angle as @xmath160 @xcite .",
    "the equation of the geodesic orbits can then be written as @xmath161 where @xmath162 for stable circular orbits , we must have @xmath163 so that the potential describes a minimum of the motion .",
    "these conditions lead to the following expressions for the energy and total angular momentum as @xcite @xmath164 on the other hand the line element ( [ eq12 ] ) can be written in terms of the velocity , measured by an inertial observer far from the source as @xcite @xmath165 where @xmath166 . \\label{1eq64}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     as a function of @xmath167 with @xmath168 , and @xmath169 . ]    in the case of stable circular orbits we have the following expression for the tangential velocity @xcite @xmath170 using the expressions for the conserved quantities @xmath171 and @xmath172 , we obtain @xmath173 use of equation ( [ 1eq62 ] ) then leads to @xmath174 showing that @xmath175 depends only on the time - time component of the metric .",
    "using equation ( [ 1eq45 ] ) , the tangential velocity in terms of @xmath126 is given by @xmath176 although we can not express @xmath175 explicitly in terms of @xmath13 , we can obtain the value of the tangential velocity at infinity from equation ( [ sol1 ] ) .",
    "we see from this equation that in the case of @xmath177 where @xmath178 we have @xmath151 .",
    "if we use the upper sign the tangential velocity at infinity is given by @xmath179 we only need to fix the ratio of the constants in equation ( [ vinf ] ) to be consistent with the observational data .",
    "for example with the choice @xmath180 we have @xmath181 .",
    "figure [ fig ] shows a plot of @xmath175 as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "let us obtain the x - matter mass of the galaxy and its dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "after integrating equation ( [ 1eq29 ] ) , we obtain @xmath182 where we have defined @xmath183 that is equation ( [ eq37 ] ) with @xmath184 .",
    "now define a boundary @xmath55 of the galaxy where @xmath185 .",
    "we then have @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the total mass of the the galaxy . by equations ( [ 1eq46 ] ) , ( [ 1eq68 ] ) and ( [ 1eq74 ] )",
    ", we can find the relation between constants of the model in terms of the tangential velocity at the boundary @xmath188 ^ 2}.\\label{1eq76}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now , substituting equations ( [ 1eq46 ] ) and ( [ 1eq68 ] ) into equation ( [ 1eq70 ] ) and using equation ( [ 1eq76 ] ) , we obtain @xmath189 where we have used the fact that the tangential velocity is much smaller than the speed of light .",
    "the x - matter mass depends linearly on @xmath13 even after the boundary of the galaxy is reached , and has a value of the order of the baryonic mass .",
    "this is in agreement with the observational data .",
    "in this paper we have considered the problems of virial mass and rotation curves of galaxies in the context of a brane - world scenario which uses a confining potential instead of @xmath1 symmetry and the israel junction conditions in order to confine the gauge fields to the brane .",
    "we have shown that these problems can be adequately addressed in this model by identifying the conserved geometric quantity @xmath3 with a new kind of matter , also known as the x - matter .",
    "the virial theorem was then obtained , assuming a perfect fluid form for @xmath3 and shown to be related linearly to a geometrical mass obtained by @xmath3 .",
    "we also assumed an anisotropic form for @xmath3 in order to find the energy - density and the pressure of the x - matter and obtained the tangential velocity of a point particle in the galaxy , showing that it behaves linearly with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "the x - matter mass of the galaxy was then calculated and shown to be of the order of the baryonic mass of the galaxy which extends beyond its boundary linearly with @xmath13 .",
