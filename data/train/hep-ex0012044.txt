    "the theory of strong interactions , quantum chromo dynamics ( qcd ) , gives a successful description of most aspects of hadronic final states in @xmath14   annihilation and other high energy particle collision processes over a large range of centre - of - mass ( cms ) energies , see e.g. @xcite . in particular , the strong coupling @xmath15 , the only free parameter in the theory , can be measured to an accuracy of about 3%  @xcite .",
    "standard qcd contains three distinct colour charges which are carried by the quarks and obey the su(3 ) symmetry group , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "requiring local gauge invariance of the theory generates eight massless vector fields , the gluons , each carrying a colour charge and an anticolour charge . since the gluons are colour charged qcd has more fundamental vertices than qed , where the gauge boson , the photon , is electrically neutral .",
    "the fundamental vertices are i ) the radiation of a gluon from a quark line ( gluon bremsstrahlung ) , ii ) the conversion of a gluon into a quark - antiquark pair ( quark pair production ) , iii ) the conversion of a gluon into two gluons ( triple gluon vertex ) and iv ) the conversion of a gluon into three gluons ( quartic gluon vertex ) .",
    "the quartic gluon vertex is in @xmath14  annihilation of order @xmath16  and thus inaccessible to the @xmath4analysis presented here ( see section  [ sec_pred ] ) .",
    "the relative weights of each of the vertices are given by the qcd colour factors @xmath1 , @xmath17  and @xmath0  corresponding to vertices i ) , ii ) and iii ) , respectively  @xcite .",
    "the colour factor @xmath17  for vertex ii ) contributes for each of @xmath2  active quark flavours , such that the product @xmath18 is the weight for vertex ii ) .",
    "the colour factors can be calculated from the generators of gauge transformations in the fundamental and adjoint representation once a particular symmetry group has been chosen . in standard",
    "qcd the symmetry group is su(3 ) and the corresponding values of the colour factors are @xmath12 , @xmath19 and @xmath11 .",
    "perturbative qcd calculations , e.g. for cross sections , depend on the symmetry group only through the colour factors .",
    "it is thus straightforward to modify the prediction for a different symmetry group by recalculating the colour factors .    from an experimental point of view",
    "one can ask the question if su(3 ) is indeed the correct symmetry group for qcd .",
    "this question may be tested experimentally by allowing the colour factors to vary in comparisons of qcd predictions with data .",
    "several such studies have been performed by the lep experiments based on correlations of angles in 4-jet final states  @xcite . in these studies",
    "the colour factors enter at leading order ( @xmath4 ) of the qcd calculations and thus higher order corrections have not been taken into account .",
    "measurements of the ratios @xmath20 and @xmath21 by this method have been in agreement with the qcd expectations .",
    "a complementary approach has been to employ distributions of event shape observables measured at lep  1 and @xmath4+nlla . ]",
    "qcd predictions@xcite . here",
    "the sensitivity to the colour factors also enters at @xmath4  but higher order corrections are partially taken care of by the inclusion of the nlla terms .",
    "more recent works combined the two analysis techniques outlined above  @xcite and also made use of recently calculated higher order corrections to the 4-jet angular correlations  @xcite . in both cases results",
    "have been consistent with qcd predictions and systematic uncertainties were reduced .",
    "it is also possible to use the dependence of qcd predictions on the energy scale of the hard process to gain sensitivity to the colour factors  @xcite .",
    "the dependence of qcd predictions on the energy scale enters through the running of the strong coupling @xmath15  which in turn is a function of the colour factors .",
    "a common property of all studies discussed so far is that they rely on monte carlo models of the hadronisation process , typically jetset@xcite , herwig  @xcite or ariadne  @xcite .",
    "dependence on these hadronisation models in studies of the qcd gauge structure may be viewed as a disadvantage , because the models assume standard qcd with the su(3 ) symmetry group to be valid .",
    "no attempt was made to study the effects of non - standard colour factors on the hadronisation corrections .",
    "however , such effects could be significant , because the parton shower stages in the monte carlo models are based on qcd calculations which in turn depend on the qcd gauge symmetry .",
    "recently an analytic model of the hadronisation process has become available  @xcite commonly referred to as power corrections .",
    "it is based on the analysis of the power - behaviour of non - perturbative effects , i.e. the growth of non - perturbative effects with inverse powers of the scale of the hard process . in this model",
    "approximate predictions for the non - perturbative effects on mean values and distributions of some event shape observables have been made and their colour structure is explicitly given  @xcite .",
    "comparison with data has been reasonably successful  @xcite .    in this study",
    "we use fits of @xmath4+nlla qcd predictions with power corrections to differential distributions of the event shape observables thrust , c - parameter , total and wide jet broadening measured in @xmath14  annihilation at cms energies from 14  gev to 189  gev to investigate the gauge structure of qcd .",
    "section  [ sec_pred ] introduces the observables and summarises the qcd predictions .",
    "section  [ sec_fits ] gives a description of the data sets used in the analysis and of the fit results .",
    "finally in section  [ sec_summ ] a summary and conclusions are given .",
    "we use the following event shape observables :    thrust : :    this observable is defined by the expression  @xcite    @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the momentum of    reconstructed particle @xmath24 in an event .",
    "the thrust axis    @xmath25 is the direction @xmath26 for    which the maximum occurs .",
    "we will use the form @xmath5  here    since its distribution is in this form more similar to those of the    other observables .",
    "c - parameter : :    the definition of this observable  @xcite requires the    introduction of the linearised energy - momentum tensor    @xmath27 and its three eigenvalues    @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "these define    @xmath6 via    @xmath30    note that @xmath6  may equivalently be calculated by    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the angle between particles    @xmath24 and @xmath33 .",
    "jet broadening : :    the definitions of the jet broadening observables  @xcite employ a    plane through the origin perpendicular to the thrust axis    @xmath25 to divide the event into two hemispheres    @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the total and the wide jet    broadening @xmath7  and @xmath8  are defined as    @xmath36    for these observables complete @xmath4+nlla qcd predictions as well as power correction calculations for their differential distributions are available .",
    "the running of the strong coupling @xmath15  is a direct consequence of the requirement that a complete qcd calculation , e.g. for a cross section @xmath37 , should not depend on the choice of energy scale where the theory has been renormalised , formally expressed as the renormalisation group equation ( rge ) , see e.g.  @xcite : @xmath38 the running of @xmath15  is found by solving the following differential equation where @xmath39 is the beta function of qcd shown at two - loop accuracy  @xcite : @xmath40 @xmath41 the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 are independent of the renormalisation scheme .",
    "the solution to equation  ( [ equ_rge2 ] ) at this order is  @xcite @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "the quantity @xmath46  is commonly referred to as the renormalisation scale factor since it allows to study the effects of variations of the renormalisation scale in perturbative qcd predictions .",
    "it is usually varied to assess the effect of missing higher order in the perturbation series .",
    "equation  ( [ equ_runas ] ) may be solved numerically to obtain @xmath47  as a function of a reference @xmath48 .",
    "the qcd gauge structure enters via the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 of the qcd @xmath49-function .",
    "the perturbative evolution of @xmath15  diverges for small scales , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the location of the divergence , referred to as the landau pole , defines the parameter @xmath50  which in @xmath51  is given implicitly by @xmath52 .",
    "the value of @xmath50  is approximately 200  mev and indicates the scale where perturbative evolution of @xmath15  breaks down .",
    "the perturbative qcd prediction in @xmath4  for a normalised differential event shape distribution @xmath53 of a generic observable @xmath54 measured at cms energy @xmath55 may be written as follows  @xcite : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the cross section for the process @xmath3 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the @xmath51and the @xmath4  coefficients , respectively , and @xmath60 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath59 are in fact a sum of three terms each proportional to a colour factor : @xmath61 the coefficients @xmath58 and @xmath62 , @xmath63 , are obtained by integrating the @xmath4  qcd matrix elements  @xcite in the @xmath64renormalisation scheme using the program",
    "event2  @xcite . a qcd prediction in @xmath4",
    "is expected to be valid in a region of phase space where the radiation of a single hard gluon dominates ( 3-jet region ) .    for the observables considered here calculations in nlla",
    "have been performed  @xcite .",
    "the nlla is valid in a region of phase space where multiple radiation of soft and collinear gluons from a system of two hard and back - to - back partons dominates ( 2-jet region ) . in the nlla",
    "the cumulative normalised cross section @xmath65 is written as : @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "the functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 are known in nlla as : @xmath70 the coefficients @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are known analytically with complete colour structure while analytical expressions for the coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath77 are not available .",
    "the combination of the @xmath4  and the nlla calculations is a procedure called matching .",
    "several matching schemes have been used in measurements of @xmath15 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we choose to employ the so - called @xmath78-matching scheme with the following implementation  @xcite : @xmath79 the subtraction of the @xmath80 coefficients takes account of the contributions contained in the nlla as well as in the @xmath4calculations .",
    "the term @xmath81 is defined by @xmath82 and equivalently @xmath83 .",
    "our choice of the @xmath78-matching scheme is motivated by two arguments , i ) it is preferred theoretically  @xcite as well as experimentally  @xcite and ii ) it depends only on @xmath80 coefficients known analytically with full colour structure .",
    "the model of dokshitzer , marchesini and webber ( dmw )  @xcite treats the effects of gluon radiation at low energy scales ( @xmath84 ) where simple perturbative evolution of @xmath15  breaks down due to the presence of the landau pole .",
    "the model assumes that evolution of the strong coupling @xmath15  down to energies around and below the landau pole is possible .",
    "the form of @xmath47  at such low energy scales is a priori unknown and a non - perturbative parameter is introduced as the 0th moment over @xmath47 : @xmath85 the quantity @xmath86  is referred to as the infrared matching scale where the non - perturbative and standard perturbative evolution of @xmath15are merged , generally taken to be 2  gev .    for the observables considered here the power corrections to the differential distributions",
    "have been calculated up to two loops  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that a distribution @xmath87 measured at cms energy @xmath55 can be described by the shifted perturbative prediction @xmath53 : @xmath88 the factor @xmath89 is universal  @xcite and depends mainly on the non - perturbative parameter @xmath90 , the infrared matching scale @xmath86  and the cms energy @xmath91 : @xmath92 with @xmath93 for the @xmath64  renormalisation scheme .",
    "the negative terms containing @xmath48  are necessary for a consistent merging of the strong coupling in the non - perturbative and the perturbative region .",
    "the quantity @xmath94  ( milan factor ) stems from two - loop effects and is given by  @xcite @xmath95 its numerical value is 1.49 in standard qcd with @xmath96 with an estimated theoretical uncertainty of 20%  @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath97 in equation  ( [ equ_powc ] ) is observable specific and is given by : @xmath98 the functions @xmath99 , @xmath100 , with known colour structure , describe additional changes to the distributions referred to as squeeze  @xcite .",
    "we use all published data on distributions of our observables @xmath101 , @xmath6 , @xmath7  and @xmath8  which include experimental systematic uncertainties in their errors .",
    "the data available in the fits are listed in table  [ tab_data ] with references and the ranges which are considered in the fits .",
    "the fit ranges are determined by the following criteria :    data with : :    we choose to follow the approach of the opal collaboration  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ;    * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because we use the same    @xmath4+nlla calculations with the    @xmath78-matching .",
    "the opal collaboration required the    experimental and hadronisation corrections to be reasonably uniform    and not strongly model dependent within the fit ranges .",
    "in addition ,    bins at the edges of fit ranges with large    @xmath102  contributions were removed .",
    "the fit ranges of    distributions of the other experiments are adjusted to match the ones    of opal as closely as possible .",
    "data with : :    we use the studies of the recently reanalysed jade data as a    guideline  @xcite . however , we require in addition that i ) the    fit ranges should extend less far into the 2-jet region than those    used in  @xcite and ii ) the distance between the extreme 2-jet region    and the fit ranges should increase with decreasing    @xmath103 .",
    "these requirements reduce the sensitivity of    the analysis to hadronisation corrections which are generally larger    in the 2-jet region than in the 3-jet region .",
    "we also demand that no    single bin at the edge of a fit range should have a large    @xmath102contribution .    within these ranges experimental corrections for limited acceptance and resolution as well as non - perturbative effects as estimated with monte carlo models are well under control .",
    "the fits are based on equation  ( [ equ_runas ] ) for the running of @xmath15 , on equation  ( [ equ_lnr ] ) for the perturbative qcd prediction and on equation  ( [ equ_powc ] ) for the power corrections .",
    "we vary the strong coupling @xmath104  with the mass of the @xmath105  boson as a reference scale , one colour factor , i.e. @xmath2 , @xmath0  or @xmath1 , and optionally the non - perturbative parameter @xmath90  in the fits .",
    "we also investigate fits where @xmath104 , the two colour factors @xmath0  and @xmath1  and optionally @xmath90  are free parameters . fixed parameters are always set to the values as expected in standard qcd , i.e. @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . to avoid unphysical results and to stabilise the fits the free parameters are bounded by @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the fit procedure minimises a @xmath102  constructed from the difference in bin @xmath24 between the data value @xmath111 and the theoretical prediction @xmath112 divided by the total error @xmath113 : @xmath114 possible correlations between bins of a given distribution or between different distributions are neglected . with the exception of the opal data for @xmath5 , @xmath7  and @xmath8  at @xmath115 the data are measured in bins which are wider than the typical experimental resolution in order to reduce bin - to - bin migrations .",
    "many of the distributions used in this analysis were measured by the same experiments such that the presence of some correlation between distributions may be expected",
    ". there may also be correlations between the data points of any given distribution due to common systematic uncertainties . however , information about such correlations is not available in the references for the data ( see table  [ tab_data ] ) .",
    "the errors on the fitted parameters are calculated in the fit procedure from the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix after the fit has converged ( `` fit error '' ) .",
    "these errors contain the contributions from statistical fluctuations and systematic uncertainties quoted by the individual experiments .",
    "we follow two alternatives to study the influence of non - perturbative effects on our fits .",
    "firstly , we fix the non - perturbative parameter @xmath90  at a previously measured value and repeat the fits with @xmath90  varied by its total errors . secondly , we allow @xmath90  to vary in the fit .",
    "the fixed value of @xmath90  is taken from  @xcite , @xmath116 . however , some modifications had to be applied .",
    "the measurement of  @xcite used an erroneous value of the milan factor , @xmath117 instead of 1.49 , both for @xmath96 . from equation  ( [ equ_p ] ) we infer that it is sufficient to scale @xmath90by the ratio of the two values for @xmath94  as a correction . in our study",
    "we vary the colour factor @xmath2  and it would therefore be inconsistent to use two different values of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath10 in the perturbative part and @xmath96 in the non - perturbative part of the qcd prediction for massless quarks . to find our standard value of @xmath90  we scale it by the ratio of values for the milan factor determined with @xmath96 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "our final value is @xmath118 with symmetrised errors .",
    "the presence of events from the reaction @xmath119 at low cms energies @xmath103  can distort the event shape distributions , because the effects of weak decays of heavy b - hadrons on the topology of hadronic events can not anymore be neglected .",
    "an additional potential problem arises from comparing qcd calculations based on massless quarks with data containing massive quarks at @xmath103  close to the production threshold .    at @xmath120 @xmath121  events",
    "constitute about 9% of the total event samples .",
    "ideally one would correct the data experimentally by identifying @xmath121  events and removing them from the sample .",
    "however , since we have only published event shape data without information on specific quark flavours we resort to a correction based on monte carlo simulations .",
    "we generate samples of @xmath122 events at each @xmath103  with the jetset  7.4 program  @xcite with the parameter set given in  @xcite . for each event shape",
    "observable we build the ratio of distributions calculated with u , d , s and c quark events to those calculated with all events .",
    "this ratio is multiplied with the bin contents of the data to obtain corrected distributions .",
    "this procedure is applied to all data at @xmath123 .",
    "it was verified that the simulation provides an adequate description of the data at all values of @xmath123 .",
    "systematic effects due to uncertainties in the monte carlo parameters are expected to be small for the ratio except for those parameters which only affect the @xmath121  events in the samples .",
    "the most important such parameter is the value of @xmath124  in the peterson fragmentation function  @xcite which controls the fragmentation of b quarks in the simulation .",
    "threshold effects at low @xmath103  which depend on the value of the b - quark mass in the simulation are found to be negligible for the fit results .      as systematic variations we consider the following changes in the analysis :    renormalisation scale : :    the standard fits are carried out with the renormalisation scale    parameter @xmath125 .",
    "the dependence on    the renormalisation scale is investigated by repeating the fits with    @xmath126 and    @xmath127  @xcite .",

    "results of the standard fits are considered as asymmetric    uncertainties .",
    "we also change the value of the infrared matching scale    @xmath86  from its standard value of 2  gev to 1  gev and    3  gev , respectively , and repeat the fits .",
    "deviations w.r.t .",
    "the    standard results are counted as asymmetric uncertainties , except for    @xmath90  where changing @xmath86  corresponds    to a redefinition of the non - perturbative parameter    @xmath90 .",
    "fragmentation of b quarks : :    the standard analysis is carried out with corrected data at    @xmath123    based on the jetset tuning of  @xcite as explained in    section  [ sec_bmass ] . the value of the jetset parameter    @xmath124  is varied around its central value    @xmath131 by adding or    subtracting its error and the analysis including correction of the    data at    @xmath123    is repeated .",

    "however , fits of @xmath7  to @xmath104  and @xmath2  and fits of of @xmath8  to @xmath104 , @xmath0  and @xmath1  as well as to @xmath104  and single colour factors with @xmath90  free are unstable and we do not show these results .",

    "this is consistent with  @xcite where the error on @xmath90  was dominated by the variation of the milan factor .",
    "we conclude that the ratio of non - perturbative and perturbative contributions is well constrained by the data such that changes in the milan factor are compensated by similar changes with the opposite sign in @xmath90 . as a consequence",
    "we find that the hadronisation systematic uncertainties of fits to the colour factors are reduced when @xmath90  is a free parameter while the fit errors increase due to the presence of an extra free parameter in the fit .",
    "we observe that the experimental uncertainties estimated by repeating the fits with reduced data sets are larger in the fits with @xmath90free .",
    "this effect is likely to be a reflection of the increased fit errors .",

    "the results for @xmath104  and @xmath90from the combination are consistent with the individual fits and with previous measurements  @xcite , see table  [ tab_combres ] .",
    "in the case of @xmath2  the combined result has a slightly larger total uncertainty than the individual result based on the observable @xmath5  shown in table  [ tab_res_nf_a0free ] .",
    "this is mainly due to the increased experimental uncertainty of the combined result which in turn is dominated by the experimental uncertainty of the fit with @xmath6 . for the other colour factors",
    "@xmath0  and @xmath1  the total uncertainties of the combined results are somewhat smaller than the total uncertainties of the individual results .",
    "these observations are consistent , since we do not expect the total uncertainties to be greatly reduced by a combination of individual results due to the large correlations between the event shape distributions .    a combined result for the results of the simultaneous fits of @xmath0  and @xmath1",
    "may only be constructed from the fits with @xmath90  fixed , because in the fits with @xmath90  free we obtained usable fits only for the observable @xmath5 . applying the same procedure as outlined above yields the following results for combining the results of the fits with the observables @xmath5  and @xmath6  shown in table  [ tab_res_cacf ] : @xmath136 the scale uncertainty of the combined result for @xmath1  is smaller than 0.01 consistent with the small scale uncertainties of the individual results , see table  [ tab_res_cacf ] .",
    "the results for @xmath0  and @xmath1are in good agreement with the combined results discussed above , see equation  ( [ equ_indres ] ) .",
    "the combined result for @xmath104  is in agreement with the individual results and also with  @xcite , see table  [ tab_combres ] .",
    "the averaged correlation coefficient from the fits is @xmath137 .",
    "however , we observe that variations of the results for @xmath0  and @xmath1  are positively correlated when @xmath90  is changed . in order to find a conservative estimate of the correlation coefficient",
    "we construct a covariance matrix by summing i ) the covariance matrix from the fit and ii ) one covariance matrix for each systematic uncertainty .",
    "the covariance matrices ii ) are constructed from the systematic uncertainties , symmetrised if necessary , and @xmath137 , except for the systematic uncertainty from the variation of @xmath90  where @xmath138 is used .",
    "the resulting total correlation coefficient is @xmath139 .",
    "figure  [ fig_plotcacfcont ] presents the combined results which are in good agreement with standard qcd within the uncertainties .",
    "some other possible gauge groups are indicated including u(1)@xmath140 , an abelian qcd with three quark colours and colour neutral gluons .",
    "our results exclude all shown alternatives to su(3 ) as the gauge group of qcd at more than 95% confidence level .",
    "we have studied fits of @xmath4+nlla qcd predictions for distributions of the event shape observables @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7  and @xmath8  with power correction calculations to model hadronisation effects to data measured at cms energies ranging from 14  gev to 189  gev . in these fits",
    "we varied simultaneously the strong coupling @xmath104 , one of the qcd colour factors @xmath0  or @xmath1 , or the the number active quarks @xmath2 , and in some cases also @xmath90 , the free parameter of the power correction calculations .",
    "we investigated in addition fits , where @xmath104 , @xmath0  and @xmath1  and optionally @xmath90  were varied .",
    "we found stable fits in all cases with the observables @xmath5  and @xmath6while some fits with @xmath7  and in particular @xmath8  appear unreliable .",
    "we take this as an indication that the current @xmath4+nlla qcd calculations with power corrections for @xmath7  and @xmath8  describe the data not as well as the same calculations for @xmath5  and @xmath6 .",
    "we observed that the variation of the milan factor @xmath94  and the infrared matching scale @xmath86  in the fits with @xmath90  free gave rise to smaller systematic uncertainties than the systematic variation of @xmath90  in the fits with @xmath90  fixed .",
    "our conclusion is that the relative contributions of the perturbative @xmath4+nlla qcd calculations and the power correction terms to the total predictions are quite well constrained by the data .    a combination of the individual results of the fits with @xmath104 , an individual colour factor and @xmath90  as free parameters with the observables @xmath5  and @xmath6  yields our final results : @xmath141 the combination of results from simultaneous fits of @xmath0 , @xmath1  and @xmath104  for @xmath90  fixed with the observables @xmath5  and @xmath6  gives @xmath142 with total correlation coefficient @xmath139 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the expectation from standard qcd based on the su(3 ) symmetry group for @xmath14  annihilation data at high energies , i.e. @xmath10 with @xmath19 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "there is also good agreement between the individual and the simultaneous measurements of @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
    "all combined results for @xmath104  and @xmath90  are in agreement with previous measurements .",
    "we found that the total uncertainties of the combined results are approximately of the same size as the total uncertainties of the individual results .",
    "this is consistent , because the event shape distributions are correlated with each other and the total uncertainties are dominated by the fit errors and experimental uncertainties .",
    "we present our final conclusions from two points of view .",
    "firstly , we assume that the power correction calculations are a good model of hadronisation effects in event shape distributions . in this case",
    "we have performed a complementary test of the gauge structure of qcd with competitive uncertainties on the measurements of the qcd colour factors compared to other analyses  @xcite .",
    "secondly , under the assumption that qcd with su(3 ) group symmetry is the correct theory of strong interactions , our analysis provides a successful consistency check of the power correction calculations .",
