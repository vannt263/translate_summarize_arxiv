    "while most dedicated surveys to directly image extrasolar planets around nearby stars yielded null results ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some remarkable exceptions were discovered in the last years : the hr8799 planetary system @xcite , fomalhaut b @xcite , @xmath6 pictoris b @xcite , and 1rxs j1609 - 2105 b @xcite .",
    "the host stars of the first three systems are all a - type stars and they harbor both massive planets and debris disks",
    ". for fomalhaut and @xmath6 pictoris dynamical interactions between the exoplanets and the disks led to observable signatures : an offset between the debris disk center and the star ( fomalhaut ) or disk warps ( @xmath6 pictoris ) .",
    "thus , although there seems to be no direct correlation between the existence of both a debris disks and ( an ) exoplanet(s ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , specific properties of the debris disk can hint toward the existence of low - mass companions .",
    "here , we report on the search for low - mass companions around hd115892 and hd172555 using direct imaging .",
    "both objects are also young , nearby , a - type stars ( see , table  [ targets ] ) that are surrounded by debris disks @xcite .",
    "these objects are , however , particularly interesting because their disks have a very high fractional luminosity and appear too luminous for their age @xcite .",
    "since steady state evolutionary models of debris disks predict a much lower dust luminosity it was suggested that either the planetesimals in these systems have unusual properties or the observed , luminous dust could be transient @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xcite found evidence for silica dust and sio gas in the mid - infrared spectrum of hd172555 which could be indicative of a high - velocity collision of protoplanets or planetesimals .",
    "such a collision could have been triggered via dynamical interactions or gravitational stirring by a so far unseen companion , so we sought to search for it directly .",
    "we used the apodizing phase plate ( app ) coronagraph installed at vlt / naco @xcite .",
    "the app is designed to work in the 35 @xmath0 m wavelength range where it enhances the contrast between @xmath127 @xmath7 on one side of the psf ( figure  [ psf ] ; see also , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this inner working angle ( iwa ) corresponds to projected separations of @xmath1525 au around our targets , comparable to the giant planets orbits in our own solar system .",
    "the debris disks are located within the inner 10 au around each object ( table  [ targets ] ) .",
    "the data were obtained on 2010 - 04 - 04 during the commissioning of the app with the high - resolution ao - camera naco @xcite mounted on eso s vlt ut4 . using the same observing setup already used to image the exoplanet @xmath6 pictoris b @xcite , we chose the l27 camera ( @xmath1 27.15 mas pixel@xmath8 ) with the visible wavefront sensor .",
    "all images were taken in the nb4.05 filter ( @xmath9 m , @xmath10 m ) and in pupil stabilized mode .",
    "these are the first data sets that combine the app with angular differential imaging ( adi ) @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "we used the `` cube mode '' readout where all image frames , i.e. , each single exposure , are saved individually . to ensure that no frames were lost we only read out a 512@xmath11512 pixels sub - array of the detector .",
    "the effective field - of - view ( fov ) using the app in this sub - array mode is restricted to the uppermost 512@xmath1190 pixels ( i.e. , roughly 13.9@xmath122.4@xmath2 ) as the app introduces a vertical shift of the image along the detector s y - axis .",
    "for both sources , several data cubes were taken each at a slightly different dither position following a 3point dither pattern along the x - direction of the detector s effective fov .",
    "halfway through the observations the camera was rotated by 180@xmath13 so that the high contrast side of the app covered both hemispheres . due to an error during the rotation of the camera , we did not cover the full 360@xmath13 around the targets ( see , section  [ analysis ] ) . in total we obtained 54 and 36 data cubes for hd115892 in hemisphere 1 and 2 , respectively , and 18 and 24 data cubes for hd172555 .",
    "each cube consists of 200 individual image frames , i.e. , exposures .",
    "table  [ observations ] summarizes the observations and also the observing conditions . to enhance the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of potential companions , we chose to saturate the core of the stellar psfs , but we note that the app reduces the peak flux in the psf core by roughly 40% @xcite .    for the photometric calibration we also obtained unsaturated images of both targets .",
    "we used the same observing strategy but decreased the detector integration time ( dit ) to 0.0558 s for hd115892 and 0.2 s for hd172555 and took only 6 data cubes , each consisting of 200 exposures , for each calibration data set . in figure  [ psf ]",
    "we show the median combined image of 1 cube for hd172555 .",
    "the general data reduction approach ( bad pixel correction , sky subtraction ) is described in @xcite .",
    "this time , however , since we had sufficient field rotation ( @xmath1410@xmath13 ) during our observations we used the loci algorithm @xcite to subtract the stellar psf of our images .",
    "loci creates a reference psf for each image from a linear combination of all other images observed at a different parallactic angles .",
    "the coefficients of the combination are optimized inside different subsections of the image independently so that the residual noise within each subsection is minimized .",
    "we refer the reader to the original paper for a more detailed description of loci . by scaling and inserting the psf of the unsaturated images as fake planets with known brightness in the raw frames and retrieving them in the final image we did a small parameter study to optimize the loci parameters for our purposes . the best results in terms of planet contrast and s / n . ]",
    "were achieved with the following loci parameters which we used for the final analyses : fwhm=4.5 px , @xmath15=0.75 , @xmath16=3 , @xmath17=200 .",
    "we note that we used loci on each individual image frame and not on stacked images as the former approach provided better detection performances .",
    "the data for each hemisphere was reduced separately . in a last step ,",
    "we cut vertically through the center of each psf - subtracted frame and saved only the high - contrast , i.e. , left - hand , side of the psf .",
    "for both hemispheres these images were then rotated to the same field orientation and averaged to create our final image .",
    "no additional filtering was applied to our data .",
    "in figure  [ images ] we show the final psf - subtracted images for hd115892 and hd172555 in the left column . due to the rotation error described above we lack data in a wedge in the north - east quadrant of both objects . on the opposite side of the central star ,",
    "however , a wedge of the same size was covered during the observations of both hemispheres .",
    "the right column of figure  [ images ] shows the number of frames that were eventually combined for a given position for the final image .",
    "our final images probe regions as close as @xmath10.3@xmath2 ( 5.5 au ) and @xmath10.4@xmath2 ( 11 au ) around hd115892 and hd172555 , respectively , and out to 1@xmath2 as the maximum distance around each target .",
    "since objects tend to slightly drift across the detector in naco s pupil stabilized mode , we could only combine the maximum number of frames in the innermost @xmath10.8@xmath2 ( see , right column figure  [ images ] ) .",
    "we did not detect any faint companions in our final images .",
    "however , by inserting and retrieving fake planets we can determine the sensitivity of our observations and put constraints on the maximum brightness of potential non - detected companions .",
    "since loci can significantly reduce the flux of any detected point source , detection limits need to be based on the retrieval of fake companions and can not be derived solely from the noise in the final image .",
    "a complicating factor in our case is the inhomogeneous sensitivity across the final images .",
    "we decided to put fake planets in regions where only data from one hemisphere is combined and not in the overlapping regions .",
    "this approach is representative for a `` typical '' app observing run and the results are representative for typical app detection limits .",
    "we used the data of hemisphere 1 for hd115892 and of hemisphere 2 for hd172555 . for hd115892 ,",
    "10681 and 9615 frames were combined for separations @xmath180.8@xmath2 and @xmath140.8  , respectively .",
    "for hd172555 we could combine 4697 and 3046 frames in these regions .",
    "as fake planets we used for each target the median - combined psf of an unsaturated data set and scaled it to different contrast ratios based on the average count rate of the unsaturated images and the difference in exposure time between the unsaturated and the saturated images .",
    "these fake planets with known brightness were then inserted in the individual sky - subtracted raw frames at different radii taking into account the field rotation that occurred between the exposures .",
    "finally , we repeated the data reduction described above and determined the s / n of fake planets that we recovered in the final image .",
    "we did aperture photometry on the recovered planets and compared it to the standard deviation of background pixels in an annulus centered on the central star .",
    "this annulus had the same radial distance as the planet and a width twice as wide as the aperture radius .",
    "we excluded those regions in the annulus where fewer frames were combined than at the position of the planet , and we excluded the region around the planet itself ( i.e. , 3 fwhm centered on the planet ) as loci can create artificial holes left and right of a detected point source . the s / n of the fake planet can then be expressed as    @xmath19    with @xmath20 being the flux of the planet , @xmath3 the standard deviation of the pixels in the annulus ( both measured in count rate ) and @xmath21 the aperture radius .",
    "we inserted fake planets with a contrast between 9 and 11 mag in the hd115892 data and between 8 and 9 mag in the hd172555 data and computed the s / n for two aperture sizes ( 2 and 3 pixels radius ) .",
    "the final 5@xmath3 contrast limit for a given separation was then derived by averaging the s / n in both apertures , taking those fake planets where the averaged s / n was the lowest but @xmath225 and extrapolating the contrast of the planet to a value that would correspond to a 5@xmath3 detection .",
    "we emphasize that we did not apply any sort of filtering or background smoothing to our data which makes our final s / n estimates rather conservative .",
    "also the optimized extraction of a psf template could lead to the robust detection of fainter companions .    in figure  [ detection_limits ]",
    "we show the final 5@xmath3 detection limits for both objects between 0.31.0@xmath2 .",
    "overplotted are detectable mass limits for a given contrast and the age of the star ( table  [ targets ] ) .",
    "these mass limits are derived from the dusty and cond evolutionary models @xcite .",
    "we use the cond models for objects with effective temperatures below @xmath11700 k and the dusty models for hotter objects . for the 350 myr old object",
    "hd115892 our data reach a contrast between @xmath110.511.3 mag at angular separations between 0.41.0@xmath2 ( 718 au ) .",
    "this contrast corresponds to detectable mass limit between 1015 m@xmath4 . at 0.3@xmath2 ( @xmath15.5 au )",
    "the contrast is @xmath19.4 mag and we are still sensitive to objects with masses @xmath525 m@xmath4 . for the 12 myr hd172555 system",
    "the contrast is @xmath19.29.8 mag at separations between 0.51.0@xmath2 ( 1529 au ) which corresponds to mass limits of 23 m@xmath4 . at 0.4@xmath2 ( @xmath111 au )",
    "the achieved contrast is @xmath18.9 mag and we are still sensitive to objects with @xmath54 m@xmath4 . due to the smaller field rotation for this object we can not probe iwa @xmath180.3@xmath2 .",
    "both our datasets have comparable total integration times and factoring in the apparent brightness of the stars both curves are comparable in terms of detectable brightness for potential companions . in addition , both contrast curves are relatively flat for separations @xmath50.5@xmath2 .",
    "this suggests that the app achieves close to background limited performance for these separations .",
    "we computed the expected background limit for the hd115892 data set based on the sky noise in individual frames far away from the star .",
    "the dashed line in the left panel in figure  [ detection_limits ] shows the result and confirms that our data are indeed ( mostly ) limited by the background and not by the contrast . due to the lack of appropriate dark frames we could not repeat this exercise for hd172555 .",
    "given the non - homogeneous data coverage in azimuth the detection limits derived above vary between different positions around each object .",
    "to estimate the global detection limits we only consider those regions where we have combined at least half as many frames as for the analysis .",
    "for hd115892 we then have to exclude an azimuthal wedge between @xmath122@xmath13134@xmath13 ( east of north ) , and for hd172555 it s regions between @xmath117@xmath13107@xmath13 ( see also right column figure  [ images ] ) . in all the other parts of the images",
    "the detection limits shown in figure  [ detection_limits ] apply with a significance of @xmath223.5@xmath3 with the lowest significance applying only in very small wedges directly adjacent to the excluded parts .",
    "@xcite used radial velocity to search for planetary mass companions to both of our targets . although they did not find any they could put some constraints on the occurrence of massive planets in short period orbits . for hd115892 they could exclude objects more massive than 1.7 , 3.8 and 100.0 m@xmath4 in 3 , 10 , and 100 day orbits , respectively , with @xmath1499% confidence .",
    "these orbital periods correspond to semi - major axes of @xmath10.06 , 0.13 , and 0.62 au assuming circular orbits . for hd172555",
    "the same confidence level was achieved for objects more massive than 11.3 m@xmath4 in a 3 or 10 day orbit ( i.e. , @xmath10.05 au and @xmath10.11 au ) , respectively . for a 100 day orbit ( i.e. , at 0.53 au ) the detection limit was 33 m@xmath4 .",
    "in addition , @xcite used naco in spectral differential imaging ( sdi ) mode to search for low - mass companion around hd172555",
    ". while our data are more sensitive in the innermost 1@xmath2 ( i.e. , for separations @xmath2330 au ) , their data cover regions out to 2@xmath2 and they could have detected objects with masses @xmath55 m@xmath4 for separation between @xmath13060 au . in combination with the other studies",
    "our data put stringent constraints on the existence of giant exoplanets around hd115892 and hd172555 interior and exterior to the debris disks .",
    "although our data probe regions very close to the assumed location of the debris disks ( 46 au ) , our hypothesis that dynamical interactions between a planet and the debris disk could have led to a recent collision of planetesimal lacks direct observational support .",
    "we note , however , that planets ( or planetary systems ) with masses below our detection limits are certainly able to dynamically shape debris disks and influence their evolution ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "our data demonstrate that the app opens up a new parameter space for direct imaging of exoplanets by pushing the background limit significantly closer to the star . a comparison",
    "to surveys carried out in the h band shows that @xcite and @xcite typically reached a contrast of @xmath110 mag and @xmath19.5 mag at a separation of 0.5@xmath2 , respectively . for hd115892",
    "our contrast is @xmath511 mag at the same separation .",
    "a similar contrast has been reported by the nici campaign at the gemini observatory @xcite also operating in the h band , but a more direct comparison of the contrast performance is limited due to different integration times and different target stars with different brightnesses . however , since planetary mass objects appear red in the infrared , naco / app has an advantage when it comes to the final detectable mass limits , because it works in the l band and not in the h band .",
    "we presented the first observations combining naco s apodizing phase plate coronagraph with angular differential imaging to search for faint companions to the young debris disk host stars hd115892 and hd172555 in the nb4.05 filter .",
    "our conclusions are as follows :    * we did not detect any point sources but achieved the following detection limits : for hd115892 we could have detected objects with a contrast of @xmath110.511.3 mag ( corresponding to 1015 m@xmath4 ) at angular separations between 0.41.0@xmath2 ( 718 au ) . at 0.3@xmath2 ( @xmath15.5 au ) the detection limit was a contrast of @xmath19.4 mag ( @xmath525 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "for hd172555 we reached a contrast of @xmath19.29.8 mag ( 23 m@xmath4 ) at separations between 0.51.0@xmath2 ( 1529 au ) . at 0.4@xmath2 ( @xmath111 au )",
    "the detection limit was a contrast of 8.9 mag ( @xmath14 m@xmath4 ) .",
    "these limits are @xmath223.5@xmath3 limits .",
    "we do not have data in an azimuthal wedge between @xmath122@xmath13134@xmath13 ( east of north ) for hd115892 and between @xmath117@xmath13107@xmath13 for hd172555 .",
