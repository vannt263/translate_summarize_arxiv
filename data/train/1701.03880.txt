    "the design of raptor codes with binary modulation has been well investigated in literature  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there has been little progress on universal design methods for raptor codes with bandwidth efficient higher - order modulation , and a complete analysis is still missing . existing work applying raptor codes to higher - order modulation  @xcite have considered the bit - interleaved coded modulation scheme ( bicm )  @xcite , which uses a single binary code to protect all bits in the signal constellation .",
    "however , it has been shown  @xcite that the bicm scheme , which averages over the different bit - channel reliabilities , may not show the optimal performance if the degree distribution is irregular , which is the case for raptor codes .",
    "in contrast , the multilevel coded ( mlc ) modulation  @xcite protects different channel bit levels using different binary codes .",
    "zhang  _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite designed multi - edge type low - density parity - check ( met - ldpc ) codes for mlc modulation for 16-quadrature amplitude modulation ( 16-qam ) and showed that the spectral efficiency can be improved when the difference in the bit - channel reliabilities are incorporated into the code design .",
    "further , hou  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the non - binary higher - order modulation channel can be decomposed into equivalent binary - input component channels for each individual bit level in the signal constellation , which simplifies the analysis and design of the mlc and bicm modulation schemes .",
    "density evolution  @xcite can then be used to design codes for each equivalent binary - input component channel .    in this work",
    ", we propose a general design framework for raptor codes for higher - order modulation using a multi - edge framework .",
    "since the multi - edge framework allows for differences in the bit channel reliabilities in the code ensemble , this enables us to design raptor codes using the mlc scheme and also to perform a comprehensive analysis of the performance of the raptor code with higher - order modulation using met density evolution ( met - de ) .",
    "the innovation of this work is that we simultaneously optimize distinct raptor code degree distributions for distinct equivalent binary - input component channels using the multi - edge framework .",
    "this helps to improve the performance in higher - order modulation systems as we are incorporating the difference in the bit - channel reliabilities into the code design .",
    "in this work , we focus on gray - labelled 16-qam , which is equivalent to gray - labelled 4-pulse - amplitude modulation ( 4-pam ) mapped independently to in - phase and quadrature components , and consider a higher - order mlc modulation scheme and parallel independent decoding strategy  @xcite .    consider a binary codeword , @xmath0 with code length @xmath1 .",
    "we can partition @xmath0 into @xmath2-tuples .",
    "let the bit position in each @xmath2-tuple , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 , be indexed by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 represents the left - most bit position .",
    "@xmath8 represents the subset of all elements of @xmath9 having value @xmath10 in bit position @xmath11 .",
    "then a @xmath12-ary modulation scheme , where @xmath13 , maps each @xmath4 , to a modulated symbol , @xmath14 , from a signal constellation , @xmath15 , according to the gray labelling scheme , and transmits over an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel .",
    "let @xmath16 denote the received symbol , which is the noisy version of @xmath14 . at the receiver side ,",
    "an a posteriori probability ( app ) module uses @xmath16 to compute the log - likelihood ratio ( llr ) for the coded bits @xmath17 as follows : @xmath18 the conditional density function , @xmath19 , for an awgn channel output @xmath16 is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the variance of the awgn .",
    "one of the difficulties in the design of bandwidth efficient systems with higher - order modulations is that equivalent binary input channels are not necessarily symmetric .",
    "therefore the performance analysis and the code design using density evolution is complicated in this case , as it is not valid to assume that the all - zero codeword is transmitted at each bit level . to address this problem , hou  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of an independent and identically distributed ( iid ) channel adapter , which produces an equivalent symmetric binary input channel with the same capacity .",
    "we incorporate this technique into the target system and design raptor codes for higher - order modulation using the standard met - de method  @xcite .",
    "note that the extension of the proposed method to other higher - order modulations is straightforward .",
    "consider a raptor code , which is a serial concatenation of an inner luby transform ( lt ) code with degree distribution @xmath22 and a precode , usually a high - rate ldpc code .",
    "for a raptor code , first , the @xmath23 bit information vector is encoded by a precode of rate @xmath24 to generate @xmath1 coded symbols , referred to as input bits .",
    "then an lt encoder , linearly transforms this input bits into an infinite stream of lt coded symbols , referred to as output bits , which is transmitted through a channel .",
    "the realized rate of the lt code is defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the average number of lt coded symbols required for a successful decoding .    ,",
    "@xmath27 , and @xmath28   respectively represent unpunctured variable nodes , punctured variable nodes and check nodes .",
    "@xmath29   and @xmath30 respectively represent the edge - type @xmath11 and the probability of having degree @xmath31 nodes . ]    now we describe the new representation of 16-qam modulated raptor codes as met - ldpc codes using a multi - edge framework .",
    "since we consider the mlc scheme , we assign one edge - type to each distinct bit level and design distinct lt degree distributions , @xmath32 , for distinct bit levels using the multi - edge framework .",
    "since a gray - labelled 16-qam is equivalent to two gray - labelled 4-pam , there are only two distinct bit - channel densities .",
