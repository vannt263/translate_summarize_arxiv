    "the conformational properties of dna and its biological functioning depend on key parameters as persistence length and helical repeat which , in turn , are sequence dependent and also vary with temperature and counterion concentrations @xcite .",
    "empirical approaches have been developed to quantify them in some cases . for circular molecules , common to mithocondrial dna , bacterial plasmids and many viral genomes , measurements of cyclization probabilities and statistical analysis of topoisomers distributions",
    "@xcite remain the fundamental methods . recently a new type of extra chromosomal circular ( ecc ) dna consisting of short sequences , @xmath0 base pairs ( _ bps _ ) , has been identified in mouse and human cells @xcite remarkably suggesting that a large variability may occur in dna of somatic tissues .",
    "topoisomers distributions are caused by thermal fluctuations which convert , by ligase , the nicked molecules to covalently closed circles each of them having a peculiar linking number ( @xmath1 ) that defines its topological state @xcite .",
    "gel electrophoresis techniques have been used to estimate the average helix rotation angles in bacteriophage pm2 and _ e.coli _ plasmid @xcite .",
    "later on , it has been shown that the double helix unwinds linearly with temperature up to the premelting regime @xcite . beyond being essential for dna characterization , a precise knowledge of helical pitch and twist density",
    "is required to design nanostructures efficiently releasing anticancer drugs @xcite and molecules with functional properties @xcite .",
    "these issues can be theoretically approached by mesoscopic models , treating dna at the level of the fundamental _ bps _ interactions , which may predict the energetically most convenient helical repeat ( @xmath2 ) for a given sequence and ambient conditions . in this paper ,",
    "i propose a method based on the path integral formalism @xcite which can be applied to any circular molecule .",
    "the model , for @xmath3 _ bps _ , includes _ both _ twisting _ and _ molecule bending to provide a realistic description of the effective interactions .",
    "this investigation extends a previous work @xcite in which the thermodynamics of a short dna had been computed , in a fixed plane representation , for a fixed value of the helical repeat . while we refer to that work for more details concerning the path integral method , here the computation simulates a large topoisomers distribution of short circular dnas with variable supercoiling degree and finds , at any temperature , the most probable twisted geometry on the basis of a macroscopic constraint , the second law of thermodynamics .",
    "as the method calculates the thermal displacements of the _ bps _ with respect to the ground state , we can also monitor the formation of fluctuational openings along the sequence .",
    "in particular , the location of the opening sites and the size of the bubbles can be determined at various temperatures .",
    "these findings may be relevant also in view of the possibility to predict the sequence specific starting sites for biological functions such as transcription which require dna unwinding and bubbles formation @xcite .",
    "the model is described in section ii while the results for a specific sequence of ref.@xcite are discussed in section iii .",
    "some final remarks are given in section iv .",
    "in general , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the twist accounting for the coiling of the individual strands around the helical axis and @xmath6 is the writhe measuring the spatial coiling of the axis itself @xcite .",
    "while @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( not necessarily integer numbers ) refer to the molecular geometry , the integer @xmath1 is independent of the specific geometry .",
    "@xmath1 is given with respect to the _ relaxed linking number _ of the least distorted topoisomer , @xmath7 .",
    "thus , it is @xmath8 which measures the molecules supercoiling with almost all living beings keeping their dna in a @xmath9 supercoiled state .",
    "this is essential to biological processes such as replication and transcription requiring the helix unwinding as a key step to favor the binding of proteins .    short linear dna , below @xmath10 _ bps",
    "_ , shows a lower probability than long sequences to ligate into circles as a consequence of the intuitive fact that bending smaller fragments has a higher energy cost .",
    "however , whenever ligation of the chain ends occurs in circles with decreasing diameters , supercoiling increments are due to twisting rather than writhing @xcite .",
    "in fact , unwinding ( or overwinding ) the double helix requires essentially the same energy per unit length whereas the writhing involves crossings of the helix axis over itself and elastic deformations which are mostly confined in the apical loops . as the latter contain a larger proportion of the helix in smaller diameter circles , it is in shorter fragments that the energy required to change @xmath6 becomes increasingly higher than the energy associated to a change in @xmath5 .",
    "hence , supercoiling increments are due to twisting rather than writhing .",
    "accordingly i assume that , for short circular dna , the helix axis lies in a plane ( @xmath11 ) while the degree of supercoiling measured by the linking number is attributed only to the twisting , @xmath12 .",
    "[ fig:1 ] displays the fragment with @xmath3 _ bps _ whose equilibrium separations are regularly arranged in a circle with center point @xmath13 and ray @xmath14 lying in the @xmath15 plane .",
    "the _ bp _ fluctuation is described by an inter - strand vector displacement @xmath16 ( @xmath17 numbers the _ bps _ in real space ) measuring the pair mates separation with respect to the ground state .",
    "the latter is recovered when @xmath18 for any @xmath17 . in general",
    ", @xmath16 spans an orbit whose center @xmath19 stays on the ground state circle hence , @xmath20 . with respect to @xmath13 ,",

    "@xmath25 is the twist of the first _ bp _ along the stack . as one turn of the helix hosts",
    "@xmath2 _ bps _ , it matters to know which twist angle is associated to the starting sequence site : in fact the choice of the initial twist may affect the fluctuational amplitudes at the successive sites .",
    "then , i integrate over a set of @xmath25 values , thus weighing an ensemble of distinct rotational conformations which contribute to the partition function .",
    "the azimuthal angle , @xmath26 , defines the ( counterclockwise ) rotation of the @xmath27 fluctuational orbit with respect to the @xmath28 plane .",
    "the latter contains the orbits of the fragment ends , the @xmath29 and @xmath30 _ bps _ , which overlap due to the closure condition holding for the dna ring .",
    "base pairs , which would be distant along the stack in a chain model , become closer in a circular model that accordingly accounts for stabilizing long range effects @xcite .    in general the shape of the fluctuational orbits",
    "is function of the bending @xmath31 and changes from circular ( @xmath32 ) to a straight line ( @xmath33 ) being elliptic for @xmath34 .",
    "in fact only a subset of orbital points do represent effective _ bps _ fluctuations : for instance , the @xmath29 orbit is in principle circular but , being @xmath35 a discrete variable , only those points corresponding to the chosen set of @xmath25 values do correspond to real fluctuational states for the @xmath29 _ bp_. with this caveat , one notices that the orbit size is determined by the fluctuation amplitude @xmath36 which is temperature dependent .",
    "while large thermal fluctuations may occur for any @xmath23 site , the condition @xmath37 should be anyway fulfilled in the computation so as to ensure that an overall ring shape is preserved for the dna fragment @xcite .    then , given a circular dna sequence with @xmath3 _ bps _",
