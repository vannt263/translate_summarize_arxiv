    "the differences between classical and quantum mechanics have distinct manifestations depending on how one looks at the problem . a common approach which attempts to ground classical and quantum theory in the same picture",
    "is phase space .",
    "phase space is a natural concept in classical theory since it is equivalent to the state space .",
    "the idea of formulating quantum theory in phase space dates back to 1932 with wigner @xcite .",
    "the now termed `` wigner function '' is a quasi - probability distribution on a classical phase space which represents a quantum state .",
    "the term `` quasi - probability '' refers to the fact that the function is not a true probability density as it takes on negative values for some quantum states .    in the formulation of quantum theory",
    "there are many conceptual barriers to overcome in gaining an intuition for the nature of quantum systems .",
    "the phase space reformulation , however , allows for visualization and other analytical techniques that are already well understood and applied to classical probability distributions . in this picture , much of the conceptual problems are replaced by one : negative probability . as such",
    ", negativity features prominently in many studies of the differences and transitions between quantum and classical mechanics .",
    "for example , discussions of negativity of the wigner function have appeared in the context of decoherence @xcite , chaos @xcite , nonlocality @xcite , simulatability @xcite and many more @xcite .",
    "hudson s theorem @xcite was the first to characterize the positive wigner functions .",
    "surprisingly , he found that the wigner function of a _ pure _ quantum state is positive if and only if it is a gaussian distribution in phase space  in quantum optics terminology , a coherent or squeezed state .",
    "more recently , gross @xcite has found an analog of hudson s theorem for odd dimensional wigner functions .",
    "he found that the discrete wigner function of a pure state is positive if and only if it is a stabilizer state , which is a discrete analog of a gaussian state .",
    "for the positivity of the wigner function , the question of mixed states was studied in reference @xcite and later independently in @xcite .",
    "both references independently found that a theorem in classical probability attributed to bochner @xcite and generalization thereof can be used to characterize both the valid wigner functions and the subset of positive ones .",
    "surprising at the time was that positive wigner functions were not limited to the convex hull of gaussian states .",
    "this fact allows phase space representations to be generalizations of classically efficient simulation schemes @xcite .",
    "the problem is that the wigner function is but one of an infinitude of phase space representations of quantum theory , many of which have been utilized to understand some aspects of quantum theory from both foundational and practical perspectives @xcite .",
    "it behooves us then to generalize the theorems which identified the positive wigner functions to other phase space representations .",
    "one might hope to then generalize the techniques mentioned above involving positive wigner function to other phase space representations .",
    "but , how much can the quantum bochner s theorem be generalized ?",
    "we could call any theorem that simultaneously determines the positivity of a quasi - probability distribution and the underlying operator a generalized quantum bochner s theorem , but that would be somewhat disingenuous since it misses the beautiful simplicity which bochner and others identified . but to demand such symmetry requires a restriction to a set of phase space representation which possesses a kind of generalized fourier transform .",
    "this will seem natural once the original quantum bochner s theorem is stated below since it relies on the usual fourier transform . to be precise ,",
    "we show that discrete phase space representations that are built on projective unitary representations of abelian groups , which also have an additional property we call a _ projective fourier frame _ , naturally enable a theorem characterizing the valid and positive quasi - probability distributions .",
    "the outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section [ s : bochner s theorem ] we review quantum bochner s theorem for both the continuous and discrete wigner functions . in section [ s : frame formalism ]",
    "we define the frame formalism which generalizes the wigner function to arbitrary quasi - probability representations of quantum states .",
    "section [ s : main ] contains the main results : a generalization of quantum bochner s theorem , a sufficient condition for discrete quasi - probability representations to admit such a generalization , and a characterization of these quasi - probability representations .",
    "we conclude with section [ s : end ] .",
    "let us first recall bochner s theorem in classical probability @xcite .",
    "we require a few standard definitions . recall that a probability density on @xmath0 , for example , is a positive function which is normalized to unity : @xmath1",
    "a related concept is a _ positive definite _ function , which is one for which the following is satisfied for arbitrary pairs of real numbers @xmath2 and complex numbers @xmath3 : @xmath4 for all positive integers @xmath5 .    a central objection in classical theory and this work is the fourier transform of @xmath6 .",
    "[ def : char ] the fourier transform of @xmath6 , @xmath7 is called the _",
    "characteristic function_. the same definition will hold for the fourier transform on groups other than @xmath0 .    given a function @xmath8 , what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for its inverse fourier transform to be a valid probability density ?",
    "the answer is given by bochner s theorem :    [ bochner s theorem ] the function @xmath8 is a characteristic function  that is , the fourier transform of some probability density , if and only if the following are satisfied :    1 .",
    "@xmath9 , 2 .",
    "@xmath8 is continuous , 3 .",
    "@xmath8 is positive definite .    in this section",
    "we will review the known quantum generalizations of bochner s theorem .      the position operator @xmath10 and momentum operator @xmath11 are the central objects in the formulation of infinite dimensional quantum theory .",
    "the operators satisfy the canonical commutation relations @xmath12=i$ ] .",
    "we naturally would like a joint probability distribution @xmath13 of the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 . from the postulates of quantum mechanics we have a rule for calculating expectation values .",
    "noting that characteristic function in definition [ def : char ] is the expectation value of @xmath14 , we choose a quantization of @xmath15 and @xmath16 to obtain @xmath17 since the characteristic function is the fourier transform of the joint probability distribution , we invert to obtain @xmath18 which is the now famous wigner function of @xmath19 @xcite . the wigner function is both positive and negative for some quantum states .",
    "however , it otherwise behaves as a classical probability density on the classical phase space . for these reasons , the wigner function and others",
    "like it came to be called _ quasi - probability _ functions .",
    "the wigner functions which are positive are easily characterized by bochner s theorem",
    ". however , not every probability density corresponds to a valid quantum states .",
    "thus , we need to generalize bochner s theorem .",
    "the notion of positive definite function can be generalized to the following : a function @xmath8 is called @xmath20-positive definite if @xmath21    if the definition of the characteristic function of a density operator is extended to a generic operator , denoted also by @xmath19 , which is not necessarily a density operator to begin with , then a theorem generalizing bochner s theorem can be stated as follow , wherein the straightforward normalization condition is omitted : @xcite :    [ wigner_bochner ] let @xmath22 be the characteristic function of @xmath19 .",
    "then ,    1 .   @xmath19 is a density operator if and only if @xmath22 is 1-positive definite .",
    "@xmath19 is a density operator with positive wigner function representation if and only if @xmath22 is simultaneously 1-positive definite and 0-positive definite .",
    "this is the _ quantum bochner s theorem _ which we would like to generalize to arbitrary quasi - probability representations .",
    "note that the fourier transform features prominently ",
    "after all , the theorem is stated not for the quasi - probability density but for its fourier transform",
    ". one finite dimensional generalization of the wigner formalism is built on the _ discrete _ fourier transform .",
    "as we might expect then , the theorem looks completely analogous for that case .      consider a complex hilbert space @xmath23 of odd dimension @xmath24 and denote its standard basis @xmath25 .",
    "we define the conjugate basis as the discrete fourier transform of @xmath25 .",
    "that is , @xmath26 recall that for the continuous case , to arrive at the wigner function , we fourier inverted the characteristic function @xmath27 .",
    "first note that due to the campbell - baker - hausdorff formula , this is equivalent to inverting @xmath28 .",
    "this formula is not valid when @xmath29 and @xmath30 are bounded operators .",
    "we can continue upon noting that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the _ discrete _ displacement operators in the _ continuous _ functions they act on .",
    "they are often referred to as the _ shift _ and _ boost _ operators .",
    "we define the _",
    "generalized pauli matrices _",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "notice that @xmath33 and @xmath34 generate discrete displacements in our discrete functions .",
    "that is , @xmath37 plays the role of @xmath31 and @xmath38 plays the role of @xmath32 .",
    "so , instead of fourier inverting @xmath39 , we discretely fourier invert what we define as the characteristic function of a density matrix acting on @xmath23 : @xmath40 since there is no multiplicative inverse of 2 in even dimensions , we can see why this prescription is only valid for odd @xmath24 .",
    "the discrete fourier inverse is the _ discrete wigner function _",
    "@xmath41 if @xmath42 is a pure state and @xmath43 then @xmath44 is ( unitarily equivalent to ) the discrete wigner function defined by gross @xcite .",
    "a hermitian operator is a quantum state if it is positive semi - definite .",
    "that is , @xmath19 is density matrix if and only if @xmath45 for all hermitian @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath47 constitutes an orthogonal basis , it can be used to expand @xmath46 in its _ fourier representation _ @xmath48 let @xmath49 . then defining the matrices",
    "@xmath50 we have the follow discrete analog of quantum bochner s theorem :    [ gross_bochner ] let @xmath22 be the characteristic function of @xmath19 . then ,    1 .",
    "@xmath19 is a density operator if and only if @xmath51 .",
    "2 .   @xmath19 is a density operator with positive discrete wigner function representation if and only if both @xmath52 and @xmath51 .",
    "notice the similarity to theorem [ wigner_bochner ] .",
    "the theorems are nearly identical save for the particular definition of `` characteristic function '' .",
    "next , we outline the generalizations of the wigner functions to arbitrary quasi - probability representations and then characterize the additional structure required to make a sensible definition of characteristic functions and hence , fourier transform .",
    "let @xmath23 be a complex hilbert space of dimension @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath53 be some set of cardinality @xmath54 .",
    "this set represents some classical ontology ( such as a phase space ) . in @xcite ,",
    "generalized quasi - probability representation _ was defined to be any invertible affine map @xmath55 which has @xmath56 later , in @xcite , this was generalized to include both states and measurements in a classical formalism which only has the constraint of positivity relaxed .",
    "such a formalism encompasses all known quasi - probability representations @xcite .",
    "a _ frame _ can be thought of as a generalization of an orthonormal basis @xcite .",
    "we will define frames not for the hilbert space @xmath23 but for set of hermitian operators acting on @xmath23 , denoted @xmath57 . with the trace inner product @xmath58 , @xmath57 forms a _ real _ hilbert",
    "space itself of dimension @xmath59 .",
    "a frame for @xmath57 is a set of operators @xmath60 which satisfies @xmath61 ^ 2\\leq b{\\|a\\|}^2,\\ ] ] for all @xmath62 and some constants @xmath63 .",
    "this definition generalizes a defining condition for an orthogonal basis @xmath64 @xmath65 ^ 2 = { \\|a\\|}^2,\\ ] ] for all @xmath62 .",
    "the mapping @xmath66 $ ] is called a _ frame representation _ of @xmath57 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that each quasi - probability representation is associated with a frame .",
    "that is , given any quasi - probability function @xmath6 on @xmath53 , it must be the case that it can be obtained via the mapping @xmath67 the converse is also true : given any frame @xmath68 , equation ( [ frame map ] ) defines a quasi - probability function @xmath6 on @xmath53 .",
    "thus , we can equivalently discuss properties of the frame elements rather than those of the mapping itself or its image .",
    "for example , if a quasi - probability representation features only positive functions , then the frame elements must be positive operators .",
    "if some @xmath69 is not a positive operator , @xmath70 must obtain negative values for some quantum state .",
    "if we consider both states and measurements , then negativity must appear somewhere .",
    "this necessity of negativity is folklore than has recently been formalized in various contexts .",
    "since a frame representation is invertible , one can always invert the quasi - probability distribution and study the properties , and/or validity , of the density matrix .",
    "this is somehow unappealing , however , as it would be more convenient to work directly within the phase space formulation one is considering .",
    "this is precisely what bochner s theorem does .",
    "however , in order to obtain such simplification , some addition structure on the phase space representation must be assumed .",
    "the examples we considered in the previous section already possess quite a bit of symmetry .",
    "next , we will generalize the necessary structure to a requirement on a generic quasi - probability representation .",
    "this section presents the main results of the paper . for our purposes ,",
    "the key difference between the continuous and discrete fourier transforms is that the former is done on the group @xmath71 whereas the latter is done on a group @xmath72 . in general , the fourier transform is available on any locally compact group @xcite and the bochner s theorem can be generalized to locally compact abelian groups , compact groups , and more @xcite . here",
    "we will restrict ourselves to finite groups .",
    "the phase space , hence the index of the frame in the quasi - probability representation , will be identified with a finite abelian group , @xmath73 .",
    "we then define a `` bochner representation '' to be a quasi - probability representation which admits a quantum bochner s theorem , which will be essentially the same as the theorems [ wigner_bochner ] and [ gross_bochner ] but stated in terms of the characteristic function defined via the generalized fourier transform on @xmath73 .",
    "this restriction to abelian groups allows us to find a family of frames associated with projective representations that gives rise to bochner representations .",
    "first , we need a fourier transform on @xmath73 , which in turn requires the notion of irreducible unitary representations of @xmath73 .",
    "a unitary representation @xmath74 of @xmath73 is a homomorphism from @xmath73 to the unitary group @xmath75 of all @xmath76 unitary matrices .",
    "a representation is irreducible if and only if it has no proper subrepresentation . as an example",
    ", every group has a one - dimensional trivial irreducible representation @xmath77 .",
    "the theory simplifies tremendously when @xmath73 is a finite abelian group since there are always @xmath78 irreducible representations , all of which are one - dimensional and can be constructed by sending generators to primitive @xmath78th roots of unity .",
    "associated with any unitary representation of a group @xmath73 is the unitary character @xmath79 .",
    "the definition of the fourier transform @xmath80 of a function @xmath81 on an abelian group @xmath73 relies on the notion of irreducible characters @xmath82 , @xmath83 , associated with all irreducible representations @xmath84 of @xmath73 : @xmath85 for instance , the `` zero frequency '' component of the fourier transform comes from choosing @xmath86 to be the irreducible character of the trivial representation .",
    "the irreducible characters form a basis of functions on @xmath73 .",
    "the character table @xmath87 is a complex hadamard matrix : it is unitary , because of the orthogonality of irreducible characters , and @xmath88 @xmath89 . in particular",
    ", there is the inverse fourier transform @xmath90 and the complex conjugation simply sends @xmath91 to @xmath92 .",
    "this simple relation is absent in the fourier transform on a non - abelian group , which requires replacing the unitary characters with all the entries of @xmath93 . in that case",
    "the complex conjugation sends an entry of @xmath94 to the same entry not of @xmath95 but of its transpose .",
    "this precludes a non - abelian analogue of our main theorem , theorem [ main_thm ] .",
    "the bochner s theorem adapts without difficulty to this setting :    [ gen_bochner ] a function @xmath8 is a characteristic function ( that is , the fourier transform of a valid probability mass function , the discrete analog of probability density function ) if and only if the following are satisfied :    1 .",
    "@xmath96 2 .",
    "@xmath8 is positive definite .",
    "part 1 is the normalization condition which can be checked by direct calculation . for 2 , consider @xmath97 if @xmath98 @xmath99 , then the lhs is also positive .",
    "conversely , if @xmath100 at @xmath101 , then we can choose @xmath102 so that @xmath103 vanishes everywhere except at @xmath104 , which is possible because @xmath82 form a basis of functions on @xmath73 .",
    "this theorem will give us the analog of the 0-positivity condition for the quasi - probability distributions over @xmath73 .",
    "next , we will need to define the analog of the 1-positivity condition .",
    "in anticipation of this , we first require some additional structure on the frame elements . in particular , they must arise from a unitary projective representation .      instead of mapping to the unitary group @xmath75 ,",

    "the kernel of a projective representation is a set of group elements that are mapped to the identity operator up to a phase .",

    "we allow the frame to inherit the fourier transform from its underlying group :    let @xmath133 be a frame and @xmath73 be a finite abelian group .",

    "so this definition will suffice for our application .",
    "now recall we would like to find those quasi - probability representations which give rise to a theorem analogous to quantum bochner s theorem for the wigner function ( theorem [ wigner_bochner ] )",

    "but since @xmath176 also , upon doing the fourier transform , we end up with only two quasi - probability representations that are not related by a unitary transformation depending on whether we change the phases of an odd or even number of pauli matrices .",
    "they coincides with the two similarity classes of the qubit phase space identified in @xcite .",
    "( see figure [ wootters ] . )        for @xmath177 , there is only @xmath178 , and two inequivalent projective representations but with the same image .",
    "the phase freedom that remains after setting @xmath172 is enough to make the set of quasi - probability representations generated from the two classes identical . the phase freedom , however , supplies a continuum of choices in choosing different @xmath173 , whose quasi - probability representations are in general not unitarily related , one of them being the discrete wigner function of gross @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath179 is the first instance with more than one choice of group ( @xmath180 or @xmath181 ) and inequivalent projective representations ( of @xmath181 ) that generate distinct quasi - probability representations .    what of unfaithful projective frames ? it is well known that transferring wigner representation tomography to an even dimensional system requires care .",
    "wootters first suggested factoring @xmath24 into its prime components and considering each component as a subsystem .",
    "the discrete phase space is then a multidimensional array , with a dimension for each subsystem @xcite .",
    "alternatively , leonhardt defined a discrete wigner function for even @xmath24 on a single @xmath182 by @xmath182 phase space @xcite . from the perspective of this work ,",
    "the reason for doubling the phase space is that the discrete analog of the continuous displacement operators considered there satisfies the relation @xmath144 not in @xmath183 but in @xmath184 .",
    "leonhardt s phase space is thus an example of a bochner representation defined by an unfaithful projective frame .",
    "an unfaithful projective frame of size @xmath5 can give rise to a frame of size less than @xmath5 .",
    "as an example , suppose that the quantum system is 2 dimensional and the group is @xmath185 .",
    "there is an irreducible projective representation sending the elements ( 0,0,0),(1,0,0 ) to @xmath186 , ( 0,0,1),(1,0,1 ) to @xmath37 , ( 0,1,0),(1,1,0 ) to @xmath38 , and ( 0,1,1),(1,1,1 ) to @xmath187 .",
    "( that is , ( 1,0,0 ) is in the kernel of this representation . ) but one can find an irreducible character sending the first group element of each pair above to 1 while sending the other element to -1 .",
    "this component of the fourier transform is therefore zero , which is not surprising because this projective frame is highly redundant .",
    "( all the nonzero components still form a basis . )",
    "there are many discrete analogs of the wigner function identified in @xcite which do not possess the symmetry we have utilized here .",
    "for example , hardy s vector representation @xcite and the representation based on symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued measures ( sic povms ) @xcite whose frame is a set of rank - one projection operators that form a basis .",
    "there is no projective frame for this representation since a complete set of projection operators can not all be pairwise orthogonal .",
    "quantum bochner s theorem lets us work directly within the phase space formalism of some quasi - probability representation .",
    "this convenience is an alternative to mapping back to the usual complex matrix representation to discuss properties of quantum states .",
    "working entirely within the phase space representation of wigner has proven useful for many conceptual and computational tasks in quantum mechanics . in this paper",
    "we have generalized the quantum bochner s theorem beyond the wigner function to other discrete phase space distributions .",
    "specifically , we have found that the quasi - probability representations defined by the fourier transform of projective representations of finite abelian groups admit a quantum analog of bochner s theorem .",
    "we hope that this result will prove useful in the quest to identifying classes of quantum states which can be represented positively in some representation @xcite . with some additional work ,",
    "we could then , for example , say such states are efficiently simulatable , which can be seen as a generalization of simulation results pertaining only to the wigner function @xcite .",
    "the goal of this line of reasoning is to have a concrete operational meaning for the oft - quoted sentiment that negativity is an indicator of quantumness .    in future work",
    ", we hope to investigate alternative constructions for non - abelian @xmath73 which preserves the hermiticity of the frame .",
    "also , leonhardt s phase space seems to be the only existing example of an unfaithful projective frame which possesses a quantum bochner s theorem .",
    "some further investigation would be required to determine if the endeavor of characterizing all @xmath73 that give rise to unfaithful projective frames is promising .",
    "finally , investigations have begun in studying negativity in relativistic generalizations of the wigner function , where it has been found that non - gaussian states can also possess positive wigner function @xcite .",
    "perhaps the approach taken here can shed light on the nonexistence of a naive extension of hudson s theorem to the relativistic setting .",
