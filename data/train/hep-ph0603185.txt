    "one of the outstanding issues in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in recent years is the discrepancy between the theoretical predictions and the experimental measurements for the exclusive production of @xmath4 in @xmath5 collisions at the @xmath1 factories .",
    "the cross section times the branching ratio into at least two charged tracks has been measured by the belle collaboration to be @xmath6 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) and by the babar collaboration to be @xmath7 ( ref .",
    "in contrast , calculations by braaten and lee @xcite and by liu , he , and chao @xcite using the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization approach @xcite at leading order in @xmath2 yield predictions of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . and the charmonium wave functions at the origin and from the inclusion of qed effects in the calculation of ref .  @xcite . ] a similar disagreement between nrqcd factorization and experiment holds for production of @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons in conjunction with a @xmath12 meson .",
    "a recent calculation of corrections of next - to - leading order in @xmath2 leads to an enhancement of the theoretical prediction of about a factor 1.8 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) . nevertheless , a substantial discrepancy between theory and experiment remains .",
    "it has been suggested in several recent papers @xcite that predictions for the @xmath13 production cross section in the light - cone formalism might be in better agreement with experiment . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus on the work of bondar and chernyak in ref .",
    "@xcite , henceforth referred to as bc . in bc , it is claimed that an enhancement of the cross section occurs in the light - cone formalism because the expressions for the cross section contain an integration over the light - cone momentum . in contrast , in the nrqcd factorization approach , cross sections are computed as an expansion in the velocity @xmath14 of the heavy quark or antiquark in the quarkonium rest frame . in the leading order in @xmath14 , the relative momentum of the heavy quark and antiquark are neglected , which is equivalent in the light - cone formalism to approximating the light - cone distribution amplitude ( light - cone wave function ) by a delta function at a light - cone momentum fraction of @xmath15 .",
    "effects of the nonzero relative momentum of the heavy quark and antiquark in nrqcd are taken into account through terms of higher order in the @xmath14 expansion .    the nrqcd factorization and light - cone formalisms are both believed to be valid approximations to qcd for the process @xmath16 in the limit in which the hard - scattering momentum transfer is much greater than either the qcd scale @xmath17 or the charm - quark mass @xmath18 . in nrqcd factorization ,",
    "one makes the further assumption that the cross section can be written as an expansion in powers of @xmath14 . since the light - cone and nrqcd factorization approaches",
    "are both first - principles methods , their predictions should be in reasonable agreement unless , as is asserted in bc , the @xmath14 expansion of nrqcd breaks down for the process @xmath16 .    in this paper",
    "we investigate several issues with regard to the calculation in bc by making use of light - cone distribution amplitudes that are derived from potential - model quarkonium wave functions .",
    "we first compare the light - cone distribution amplitude that we derive with the model light - cone distribution amplitudes that are used in bc .",
    "we find that they are quite similar in shape , but with significantly different asymptotic behavior at large light - cone momentum fraction , and that they lead to similar values for the cross section for @xmath19 .",
    "we then argue that a part of the contribution to the cross section that is computed in bc comes from the high - momentum tail of the light - cone distribution amplitude .",
    "such high - momentum contributions are taken into account in nrqcd through contributions to the cross section of relative order @xmath2 and higher .",
    "furthermore , since our potential - model wave function is accurate only for momenta that are much less than @xmath18 , it is not legitimate for us to include the high - momentum contribution in our light - cone calculation .",
    "when we subtract this contribution , we find that the cross section is reduced by about a factor of three",
    ". a further reduction of about a factor of two occurs when we replace with unity certain renormalization factors @xmath3 that appear in the calculation in bc , but which have no counterpart in a conventional nrqcd factorization calculation . with these modifications ,",
    "the light - cone calculation gives a cross section that is comparable to that of the nrqcd factorization calculations .",

    "if we take the values of @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath76 that were used in bc , then the value of the unsubtracted cross section @xmath34 that is obtained by using the potential - model light - cone distribution amplitude does not differ substantially from the value @xmath77  fb that is obtained by using the model light - cone distribution amplitudes of bc ( with the contribution of @xmath78 set to zero ) .",

    "however , we see from table  [ table : sigma - phi1 ] that once the @xmath72 part of the light - cone distribution amplitudes has been subtracted , the cross section does not differ greatly from that which is obtained by using @xmath92-function light - cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "we conclude that any large enhancement that arises from the finite width of the quarkonium wave function must be coming from the region that corresponds to the order-@xmath2 corrections to the nrqcd short - distance coefficient , _",
    "i.e. _ the region of large heavy - quark momentum ( @xmath93 ) . within our potential - model calculation , it is essential to remove this region , as it is not treated reliably under the nonrelativistic approximations that go into that model . in comparing with nrqcd factorization calculations ,",
    "it is necessary to identify the contribution from this region , even if one makes use of light - cone distribution amplitudes with the correct high - momentum behavior , because otherwise its contributions would be double counted in the nrqcd factorization corrections of order @xmath2 to the production cross section .",
    "we note that the order-@xmath2 corrections to the production cross section are indeed large @xcite .",
    "the absence of a large enhancement of @xmath34 relative to @xmath94 is somewhat surprising , since it is known that , in the nrqcd factorization approach , there are large corrections of order @xmath20 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) that account partially for the effects of the finite width of the quarkonium wave function .",
    "however , the order-@xmath20 corrections arise from several sources : the dependence of the amplitude on the @xmath95 relative momentum and the difference between the charmonium mass and @xmath96 in the phase space and in the relativistic normalizations of the states . of these corrections ,",
    "only the first type is sensitive to the finite width of the quarkonium wave function .",

    "@xcite ) and @xmath104  gev , we see that the order-@xmath20 corrections that arise from the dependence of the amplitude on the @xmath95 relative momentum are approximately @xmath105 of the lowest - order cross section .",
    "the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath94 is only approximately @xmath106 .",
    "however , it should be remembered that the light - cone formalism omits contributions that arise from the transverse part of the @xmath95 relative momentum .",
    "( note , though , that the transverse - momentum contributions are suppressed by a factor @xmath107 relative to the longitudinal - momentum contributions . )",
    "we also point out that , in dropping terms that are proportional to the light - cone distribution amplitude @xmath78 , we have omitted corrections of order @xmath20 that , in the case of the model light - cone distributions of bc , amount to about a @xmath108 correction relative to the cross section computed without them . in order to be more quantitative about the effects of these omissions , we have calculated the order-@xmath20 correction that is associated with the finite widths of the light - cone distributions by expanding the light - cone cross section around @xmath109 .",
    "the result is a relative correction @xmath110 .",
    "presumably , the remaining small difference between this correction and @xmath111 of about @xmath112 arises from corrections of still higher orders in @xmath14 and from the fact that we have computed @xmath113 only at leading order in @xmath2 .",
    "the discrepancy between theoretical predictions in the nrqcd factorization approach and experimental measurements of the rate for the process @xmath114 at the @xmath1 factories presents a significant challenge to our understanding of the physics of quarkonia and , perhaps , to our understanding of qcd . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( bc ) , it was suggested that the solution to this problem may lie in using the light - cone formalism to take into account the effects of the relative momenta of the heavy quarks and antiquarks in the quarkonia .",
    "the cross section calculated in bc is about a factor @xmath115@xmath116 times larger than the cross sections sections calculated at leading order in the nrqcd factorization approach @xcite .",
    "both the nrqcd factorization approach and the light - cone method are believed to approximate qcd in the limit in which the hard - scattering momentum transfer is much larger than the heavy - quark mass or @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , the apparent discrepancy between the two approaches presents a further , purely theoretical , puzzle . in this paper",
    ", we attempt to address this theoretical issue on several fronts .",
    "first , we use a potential model to construct light - cone quarkonium distribution amplitudes that are a good approximation to the true light - cone distribution amplitudes of qcd .",
    "if one knows the static heavy - quark potential sufficiently accurately , then the potential - model allows one to determine the quarkonium wave function up to corrections of relative order @xmath20 , where @xmath14 is the heavy - quark ( or antiquark ) velocity in the quarkonium rest frame .",
    "( @xmath118 for charmonium ) .",
    "we make use of the cornell potential @xcite , which , for an appropriate choice of parameters , yields a good fit to the lattice data for the heavy - quark potential  thus giving us confidence in the connection of the potential model to qcd .",
    "we use the bethe - salpeter equation to relate the potential - model wave functions to the definitions of the light - cone distributions , which are written in terms of the bethe - salpeter wave function .",
    "then , we use on - shell kinematics for the heavy quarks to relate momentum variables to light - cone variables .",
    "the latter approximation is valid up to corrections of relative order @xmath20 . finally , we integrate out the relative @xmath95 transverse momentum in the bethe - salpeter wave functions to form the light - cone distribution amplitudes .",
    "the light - cone distribution amplitudes that we derive agree reasonably well in shape with the model light - cone distribution amplitudes of bc .",
    "the calculated cross section changes very little if we replace the light - cone distribution amplitudes of bc with ours .",
    "thus , we conclude that the distribution amplitudes themselves are not the source of the theoretical discrepancy .",
    "a part of the light - cone result for the production cross section arises from the region of large @xmath95 relative momentum ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "this region is not treated accurately in our inherently nonrelativistic potential model .",
    "furthermore , it consists of contributions that are part of the order-@xmath2 correction to the hard - scattering coefficient in the nrqcd factorization approach .",
    "hence , it is necessary to identify these contributions in order to avoid double - counting the order-@xmath2 correction in making comparisons between the light - cone approach and the nrqcd factorization approach .",
    "after we subtract these contributions from the light - cone calculation , the production cross section is reduced by about a factor of three .",
    "the light - cone cross section in bc contains renormalization factors @xmath3 for the heavy - quark mass and the pseudo - scalar and tensor point - like vertices . if we set them to unity , a further reduction in the cross section of about a factor of two occurs .",
    "these renormalization factors have no counterpart in a conventional nrqcd factorization calculation .",
    "they represent an attempt to resum large logarithms of the heavy - quark virtuality in the production process divided by the square of the heavy - quark mass . however , as we have explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] , we are not convinced that these renormalization factors , as employed in bc , resum such logarithms correctly .",
    "it is important to understand whether a correct resummation yields a significant enhancement to the cross section and , if so , to incorporate it into nrqcd factorization calculations , as well as into light - cone calculations .",
    "once the factors @xmath3 have been set equal to unity , the subtracted light - cone cross section is comparable in size with the nrqcd factorization cross sections , and it differs by only about @xmath106 from the light - cone cross section that is obtained by replacing the light - cone distribution amplitudes with zero - width distribution amplitudes ( @xmath92  functions).-function light - cone distribution amplitudes , there are small differences between the light - cone and nrqcd factorization cross sections .",
    "some of these differences arise from different choices for the quarkonium wave functions at the origin , @xmath2 , and the charm - quark mass and from the inclusion of quantum - electrodynamic corrections in ref .",
    "other differences , presumably , are due to the fact that the light - cone and nrqcd factorization cross sections become equal only in the limit of infinite hard - scattering momentum transfer . ]",
    "we conclude that there is no conflict between the light - cone and nrqcd factorization results .",
    "further , it seems that enhancements to the cross section that arise from making use of a light - cone wave function of finite width are rather modest and are not sufficient to remove the discrepancy between theory and experiment .",
    "that discrepancy remains an important puzzle .",
    "at this point , the most promising avenue for its resolution seems to be the inclusion of corrections of higher order in @xmath2 ( ref.@xcite ) and @xmath14 .",
