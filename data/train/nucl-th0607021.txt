    "the usefulness of breakup reactions in addressing the problem of exotic nuclei structure is widely recognized since many years . in particular , the study of spectroscopy and single - particle strength of halo nuclei allows a direct comparison between theory and experiment , but in order to do so reliable reaction models are needed to obtain accurate cross - section calculations .",
    "therefore a good understanding of the reaction mechanism is an issue of capital importance .",
    "this work regards one - neutron breakup from exotic nuclei , with both halo and tightly bound valence particles .",
    "we concentrate on reactions on heavy targets at intermediate beam energies .",
    "the projectile ground state is regarded as a single - particle state in the two - body system made of a valence neutron plus a heavy fragment .",
    "most of the experiments are inclusive and only the heavy fragment is detected , but sometimes exclusive experiments with the valence neutron detected in coincidence @xcite-@xcite with the core have been performed . since we consider reactions involving heavy targets , the process is coulomb dominated for halo projectiles .",
    "however we will show that for normally bound initial states coulomb breakup becomes negligible and breakup reactions can be used as a tool to obtain structure information provided nuclear breakup is properly included",
    ".    there have been several approaches @xcite-@xcite to this problem , some of which consist in numerical solutions of the schrdinger equation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these approaches have reached a large degree of accuracy but the physics interpretation of the results partially relies on the comparison with results from more analytical models .",
    "furthermore due to the numerical complexity the scattering of two heavy nuclei has not been treated so far .",
    "thus our focus is not so much on the numerical aspects but rather on the understanding of the main features of the reaction mechanism in a simple , yet accurate , picture . in this spirit ,",
    "earlier works @xcite have shown the importance of treating the nuclear and coulomb interactions in a consistent way and to all orders .    within the semiclassical formalism , we now attempt to examine two aspects of the reaction process : the first one is the peripherality of the reaction , whereas the second concerns the accuracy of the dipole approximation for the coulomb interaction .",
    "they are both important to extend breakup studies to heavy reaction partners .",
    "the concept of the reaction being peripheral is important as it allows the use of spectator - like models for the core target interaction leading to a semiclassical relative motion trajectory .",
    "it underlies a large part of existing approaches , and has been recently rediscussed by capel et al.@xcite .",
    "the fact that the heavy fragment is detected , i.e. it survives the collision suggests that processes where it collides closely with the target would not contribute significantly to the measured cross - section .",
    "the main contribution is expected to come from interactions between the target and the tail of the valence neutron single - particle wave function . in halo nuclei",
    "this tail goes much beyond the range of the potential .",
    "one of the aims of this work is to compare the cross - sections obtained by using the whole single - particle wave function with that given just by its tail .",
    "this turns the formalism of @xcite less analytical and adds some numerical complications , but some light can be shed on the problem of which part of the projectile wave function the reaction is sensitive to .",
    "this is an interesting point being at the center of a scientific debate since recently the reliability of spectroscopic factors obtained from peripheral reactions has been questioned @xcite . for deeply bound states",
    "peripherality is best obtained on heavy targets .",
    "but as we will show in the following in these cases coulomb and nuclear breakup can be of the same order depending on the nucleon separation energy and they need to be treated consistently up to separation energies around 8 mev . however for larger separation energies and angular momentum states",
    "@xmath0 coulomb breakup becomes negligible .",
    "therefore for reactions involving very neutron rich projectiles we recommend the use of heavy targets .    regarding our second aim ,",
    "the formalism developed in @xcite included coulomb potential only in its dipole form , although all orders in perturbation theory were considered .",
    "it was shown that full description of the time - evolution could be obtained analytically . on the other hand , other papers",
    "@xcite have stressed the importance of going beyond the dipole term , in particular when one deals with proton haloes .",
    "a series of works has also focused on the possible effects of dipole - quadrupole interference @xcite .",
    "the second goal of this paper is therefore to calculate the breakup due to the full coulomb potential and to compare the results to those from the simple dipole approximation .",
    "this is done in preparation for a future study of proton breakup .",
    "the new aspects of the present approach with respect to our previous works @xcite are therefore : i ) the use of the full numerical woods - saxon wave function for the initial neutron state : ii ) an all - multipoles - all - order treatment of the coulomb potential ; iii ) the application to reactions in which both projectile and target are heavy nuclei .",
    "in previous papers @xcite some of us introduced a full description of the treatment of the scattering equation for a projectile which decays by single neutron breakup due to its interaction with the target .",
    "there it was shown that within the semiclassical approach for the projectile - target relative motion , the amplitude for a transition from a nucleon bound state @xmath1 in the projectile to a final continuum state @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the neutron - target interaction , responsible for the neutron transition to the continuum .",
    "@xmath5 is the core - target relative coordinate , that is approximated by a straight line trajectory with constant velocity @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the neutron - core coordinate . as usual in a semiclassical formalism , the concept of trajectory brings on the time dependence .",
    "explicitly , the initial state wave function depends on time as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the binding energy of the valence neutron .",
    "the final state wave function , will be specified later . for light targets the recoil effect due to",
    "the projectile - target coulomb potential is rather small and the interaction responsible for the reaction is mainly the neutron - target nuclear potential . in the case of heavy targets",
    "the dominant reaction mechanism is coulomb breakup .",
    "the coulomb force does not act directly on the neutron but it affects it only indirectly by causing the recoil of the core . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the combined effect of the nuclear and coulomb interactions to all orders can be taken into account by using the potential @xmath11 sum of the neutron - target optical potential and the effective coulomb dipole potential . in ref .",
    "@xcite , as in this paper we neglect the neutron - core final state interaction under the hypothesis that the observables calculated do not depend significantly on it @xcite . if for the neutron final continuum wave function we take a distorted wave of the eikonal - type @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a real vector and the eikonal phase shift is simply @xmath14 the coordinate system used in this work is presented in fig.[pall ] , where @xmath15    then the amplitude in the projectile reference frame becomes @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the time independent part of the neutron initial wave function and @xmath18 stands for the angular momentum quantum numbers , @xmath19 and @xmath10 is the neutron initial bound state energy while @xmath20 is the final neutron - core continuum energy .",
    "this formalism is closely related to @xcite .",
    "( [ amp1 ] ) is appropriate to calculate the coincidence cross section @xmath21 .",
    "finally the differential probability to the neutron momentum can be written as @xmath22 and we have averaged over the neutron initial magnetic substates .      the dipole approximation to the coulomb potential is @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the centre of mass of the projectile is assumed to follow a straight line , @xmath7 where @xmath6 is the relative motion velocity at the distance of closest approach .    as stated above ,",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to derive analytical formulae for the breakup amplitude when the above approximation is not performed . as done in @xcite , this implies the calculation of the integral @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "such integral is solvable in the dipole approximation . in order to obtain a similar result for the whole multipole expansion",
    ", a screening term is added and subtracted to the potential , thus it can be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 @xmath30 the term @xmath31 contains the singularity at @xmath32 but decays quickly with the impact parameter . on the other hand , @xmath33 ,",
    "well - behaved in the origin , accounts for the long - range character of the coulomb potential . when inserted in eq .",
    "( [ chichi ] ) , these two terms can be treated in different ways if the parameter @xmath34 is big enough . in this case , as done in @xcite with the nuclear potential , @xmath31 can be considered in the sudden approximation , yielding a phase @xmath35 whereas @xmath33 needs to keep the whole time evolution description , but , being weak , it can be approximated to first order @xmath36 therefore the coulomb phase becomes a sum of two terms @xmath37 both of them depending upon the screening parameter @xmath34 , as @xmath38 @xmath39    in order for this approximation to be valid , the screening term @xmath34 needs to be sufficiently large as to ensure that the range of @xmath31 remains short enough , and that @xmath33 does not become too large .",
    "this is next achieved by taking just @xmath40 , in which case @xmath41 @xmath42 if eq .",
    "( [ fiqui ] ) is expanded up to first order in @xmath8 , we obtain @xmath43 consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "( [ fiqui ] ) gives rise to a probability amplitude which contains only first order in the interaction potential @xmath44 .",
    "aiming for an all - order formalism , in @xcite it was shown that a possible way to achieve this is to use sudden approximation , subtract the first order term , which diverges for large impact parameter , and then to add a first order term calculated in time - dependent perturbation theory , i.e. eq . ( [ fiqui ] ) .    the sudden limit ( @xmath45 ) must be therefore taken in the above expression for @xmath46 , yielding @xmath47 the coulomb breakup probability amplitude is therefore @xmath48 moreover , the nuclear part of the breakup amplitude is given by @xmath49 with these ingredients , the expression for the differential cross - section is just @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the core - target s - matrix , depending upon its appropriate impact parameter @xmath52 .",

    "possible deformations of the @xmath55be core are not considered , thus its intrinsic spin is just zero in our approach . the ground state wave function is calculated in a wood - saxon potential with fixed geometry , radius 1.25@xmath56 fm and diffuseness 0.6 fm .",
    "our formalism only considers the interaction between the core and the target inside the core probability , given by the modulus square of the s - matrix s@xmath57 .",
    "this s - matrix is calculated by making use of a potential v@xmath57 obtained by double - folding the matter densities of @xmath55be and @xmath58pb with an effective nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite .",
    "the densities where assumed to have gaussian shapes , with parameters chosen to fit the experimentally determined root mean square radii , which are 2.30 fm for @xmath55be @xcite and 5.6 fm for @xmath58pb @xcite .    finally , when nuclear breakup is addressed below , a potential interaction v@xmath59 between the valence particle and the target is required .",
