    "since the algebras constructed by them were infinite , the result immediately raised the question : does every finite lattice occur as the congruence lattice of a _",

    "the problem remained open till today , and it is usually referred as the _ finite lattice representation problem_. it is an abstract representation problem because it asks for a solution up to isomorphism . the concrete version is the more involved question : given a sublattice @xmath3 of the the partition lattice @xmath4 of all equivalence relations on a set @xmath0 , does there exist an algebra on the same base set @xmath0 , such that @xmath3 _ equals _ the congruence lattice of this algebra ( in @xcite such lattices @xmath3 are characterized by closure properties ) .",
    "the subject of the present paper is related to the finite representation problem in its concrete version . for a fixed finite set @xmath0",
    "we consider all possible congruence lattices of algebras with base set @xmath0 .",
    "these congruence lattices ( ordered by inclusion ) form itself a lattice @xmath1 and we are going to investigate this lattice .",
    "an important tool is our knowledge about the lattice @xmath5 of all quasiorder lattices of algebras defined on the set @xmath0 described in @xcite ( using some techniques developed previously in the papers @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "these two lattices are strongly interrelated : there is a residual mapping from @xmath5 to @xmath1 . therefore , in section  [ sec:2 ] , we investigate on abstract level , how lattice properties ( which are relevant for us ) behave under residual mappings ( for instance , the coatoms of @xmath1 directly can be obtained from the coatoms of @xmath5 , see  [ b1 ] ) .",
    "based on preliminary results from section  [ sec:1 ] and the results of @xcite and section  [ sec:2 ] , we describe the atoms ( @xmath6-irreducible elements ) , coatoms ( section  [ sec:3 ] ) and further @xmath7-irreducible elements ( sections  [ sec:4 ] and  [ sec:4a ] ) of the lattice @xmath1",
    ". finally , in section  [ sec:5 ] , we investigate several lattice theoretic properties of @xmath1 , e.g. , it is tolerance simple , but has no properties related with modularity .",

    "further , let @xmath8 and @xmath9 . for a mapping @xmath10",
    ", we write @xmath11 for the image of an element @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) denotes the @xmath15-fold composition of @xmath16 ( by convention , @xmath17 is the identity mapping @xmath18 ) .",
