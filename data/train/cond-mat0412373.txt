    "the chain statistics obeys self - avoiding statistics while for larger distances the chains adopt gaussian conformations which are characterised by the exponent @xmath15 . on large distances",
    "the chains can not reduce the segmental repulsion by increasing their spatial extension , the majority of excluded volume interactions stems from intermolecular contacts @xcite .",
    "the concept of screening of excluded volume interactions in a dense polymer melt  the flory hypothesis  plays a pivotal role in modern theory of polymer melts and concentrated solutions .",
    "it has been corroborated by edwards @xcite and is born out of renormalisation group calculations @xcite .",
    "the description of chain conformations as gaussian random walks lays at the heart of many analytical or numerical approaches like , for instance , the self - consistent field theory @xcite which has been widely used to describe spatially inhomogeneous polymer systems like surfaces of polymer melts , interfaces in polymer blends or self - assembly of copolymer systems .",
    "one consequence of screening of excluded volume interactions on length scales larger than @xmath1 is the behaviour in a thin film ( see fig .  [ fig.1])@xcite : if the chains were describable by random walks without _ long - ranged _ interactions the properties parallel and perpendicular to the film surfaces would decouple . according to silberberg s hypothesis @xcite the chain conformations",
    "could be conceived as random walks reflected at the film surfaces , i.e. , parallel chain extensions would remain unperturbed .",
    "as we decrease the film thickness , @xmath0 , the chain folds back into the volume occupied by their coil and other chains are expelled from that region .",
    "silberberg s hypothesis has to break down if the self - density is comparable to the segmental number density of the bulk melt , @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 @xcite . for @xmath18",

    "[ fig.1](b ) .",
    "while these phenomenological considerations yield a description of the leading _ scaling behaviour _ of large scale chain conformations , there are subtle corrections that may lead to significant deviations : renormalisation group calculations provide great insight into the way excluded volume interactions are screened upon increasing the density and crossing over from dilute to semi - dilute solutions @xcite .",
    "these calculations predict the blob size , @xmath1 , and the chain extension , @xmath19 , as a function of the strength of the excluded volume interaction and the segmental density , @xmath16 .",
    "they also provide information about the crossover from self - avoiding walk behaviour to gaussian statistics upon increasing the distance along the chain in semi - dilute solutions . surprisingly , renormalisation group calculations by schfer @xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite of the bond - fluctuation model revealed deviations from the plateau in the kratky plot @xmath20 _ vs. _ @xmath9 which were traced back to a goldstone - type singularity .",
    "these deviations from the plateau in the kratky plot indicated deviations from the gaussian behaviour on length scales _ larger _ than @xmath1 . upon confining the chains into a thin film , one observes an increase of the deviations from the gaussian behaviour @xcite .    recently , the statistics of quasi - two - dimensional polymer melts ( called  self - avoiding trails \" ) has been studied by semenov and johner @xcite .",
    "this model corresponds to polymers confined to ultrathin films , @xmath18 , where , however , chains and chain segments are still allowed to overlap as opposed to the pure two - dimensional limit ( @xmath21 ) which has been considered thoroughly in the past resulting in beautiful analytical predictions @xcite and more recent numerically tests @xcite . rather than calculating the chain extension as a function of density and strength of the excluded volume interaction semenov and johner",
    "consider the residual excluded volume interaction which is a weak perturbation to gaussianity in @xmath22 , but is marginal , i.e. , has to be renormalised , in ultrathin layers .",
    "this allows for quantitative predictions in the melt regime both for films and in the bulk .",
    "in contrast to silberberg s argument , the chain extension for these @xmath23 systems is predicted to exhibit logarithmic corrections , @xmath24 for the parallel components ( @xmath25 ) of the end - to - end distance with respect to the walls . the first coefficient , @xmath26 , corresponding to the statistical segment length is predicted to depend only very weakly on @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "the bfm has been extensively studied in the past @xcite .",
    "chain configurations are updated by two types of canonical moves : random monomer hoppings and slithering - snake ( or reptation ) moves @xcite . in the first case we consider random displacements of an effective monomer by one lattice site in one of the 6 possible directions in the lattice .",
    "these moves are efficient in relaxing the local properties of the chain , such as the bond angle or the bond length . in slithering - snake moves , a segment of the chain",

    "this choice introduces a bias which is removed by the metropolis acceptance criterion once the chain is fully grown . for larger @xmath13 ,",
    "we started with relatively compact two - dimensional coils ( @xmath55 ) oriented parallel to the surfaces . in all cases we equilibrate our systems using a mixture of local and slithering snake moves which has been found to be the most efficient @xcite .",

    "the perpendicular component increases continuously with @xmath0 .",
    "the effect is linear for @xmath72 , as one expects even for perfectly gaussian chains .",
    "note that the perpendicular component of @xmath67 increases more rapidly as the component of the end - to - end vector for small @xmath0 . in agreement with @xcite the ( reduced ) parallel components remain constant for @xmath73 , but increase rapidly for thinner films .",
    "( we remind that for @xmath41 no chain overlap is possible in our model and the chains are rigorously two - dimensional . )",
    "this demonstrates that perpendicular and parallel components of the polymer couple in contrast to silberberg s hypothesis .",
    "note that the observed chain length dependence of the crossover slit width @xmath74 is relatively weak for the chain lengths we have probed ( cf .",
    "[ fig.2 ] inset ) .",
    "this is in line with the predicted _ logarithmic _ increase @xmath75 , @xmath76 denoting the numbers of monomers contained in the excluded volume blob , which follows readily from the condition @xmath77 utilising eqs .",

    "we will rather proceed by discussing the numerically more challenging _ curvature _ of @xmath87 , i.e. , by presenting our results on the bond - bond correlation function , which allows a much more accurate test of the predictions .",
    "the connection between mean - squared distance between two segments @xmath70 and @xmath88 along the chain and the bond - bond correlation function is due to the exact formula @xmath89 valid for @xmath29 .",
    "note that the bond vector is defined as @xmath90 , the latter identity becoming true in the continuous limit .",
    "more generally , eq .  ( [ eq : cs_rs ] ) may be written in terms of the difference operator @xmath91 . in that sense , it remains valid for arbitrary curves , @xmath92 , even for non - differentiable brownian walks .    averaging again over all pairs @xmath93 we have computed the correlation functions @xmath94 . for the normalised bond vector @xmath95 without finding any measurable difference .",
    "this might be due to the weak correlation between bond length and bond angle fluctuations . ] neglecting chain end effects and using eq .",

    "( [ eq : re_slit ] ) and ( [ eq : re_bulk ] ) , generalised to arbitrary @xmath5 , we immediately see that the bond - bond correlation function must become @xmath97 with a prefactor @xmath98 and an exponent @xmath7 for the bulk and @xmath99 , @xmath6 for ultrathin films .",
    "noticeably , the long - distance behaviour of @xmath64 is not characterised by a length scale ( persistence length ) but the residual excluded volume interaction change the dominant scaling behaviour to a scale - free power law .",
    "this is in marked contrast to flory hypothesis where long - ranged correlations between bonds are neglected and @xmath64 is assumed to decay exponentially ( or even faster ) @xcite .",
    "the technical advantage of the bond - bond correlation function compared with the curvilinear distance is that it does not depend on the trivial , but very large gaussian contribution which drops out after differentiating .",
    "hence , it allows us to focus directly on the corrections to the gaussian behaviour on large length scales .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] the perpendicular bond - bond correlation function , @xmath100 , is plotted as a function of the curvilinear distance , @xmath5 , for chain length @xmath58 and different film thicknesses , @xmath0 .",
    "for very thin films negative correlations at short distances can be observed . for @xmath42 and @xmath101 , on average , the angle @xmath102 between two consecutive bonds , in the direction perpendicular to the walls , is larger than @xmath103 ( i.e. , the two vectors have opposite direction ) .",
    "for @xmath104 , the correlations reach the minimum for @xmath105 .",
    "this means that chains fold back every two monomers .",
    "these results are a trivial consequence of confinement .",
    "for very thin films , due to strong fluctuations of the density as a function of the distance from the walls , the system essentially consists in the superposition of mono - layers with distance equal to the lattice spacing . for @xmath42 and @xmath101",
    "we have two layers , then two consecutive segments along the chain are prevalently located in different planes and the chain is reflected at the surface . for @xmath104 , we have one more layer and then up two three linked monomers can be placed at different height . upon increasing the film thickness , @xmath0 , above the blob size , @xmath1 , @xmath100 gradually tends to the curve obtained in the bulk .    the same effect can also be observed for thicker films taking into account only chains with centre of mass having a distance , @xmath106 , from the walls smaller than @xmath1 .",
    "this is a consequence of excluded volume effects in the direction perpendicular to the wall which give rise to a strong anisotropic deformation of the coil . in the inset of fig .",

    "we compare the curves obtained for @xmath107 and @xmath108 in a film with @xmath109 .",
    "while in the first case the interactions with the wall must be very strong the walls should have a negligible effect on the latter where the chains are exactly located in the middle of the film .",
    "indeed , only in the first case evident negative correlations can be seen and we recover bulk behaviour in the second .",
    "the insufficient statistics does not allow a precise location of the minimum for @xmath107 .",

    ", we observe the expected bulk exponent @xmath113 .",
    "interestingly , the prefactor , @xmath114 , increases as we decrease the film thickness , @xmath0 , although the exponent remains constant .",
    "this shift can be related to the dependence on the fraction of polymers @xmath115 which interact with the surface .",
    "chain segments close to the wall have increased bond - bond correlations @xmath116 due to the enhanced self - interaction of the segment which is , in turn , due to the reflection of the segment at the wall . to first order ,",
    "the reflections may still be described by gaussian statistics . as @xmath0 increases and the relative population of chain segments of size @xmath5 decreases the amplitude must decrease .",

    "the correlation function decays more rapidly for short chains and its explicit dependence on @xmath13 has been obtained @xcite .",

    "<S> conformational properties of polymer melts confined between two hard structureless walls are investigated by monte carlo simulation of the bond - fluctuation model . </S>",
    "<S> parallel and perpendicular components of chain extension , bond - bond correlation function and structure factor are computed and compared with recent theoretical approaches attempting to go beyond flory s and silberberg s hypotheses . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that for ultrathin films where the thickness , @xmath0 , is smaller than the excluded volume screening length ( blob size ) , @xmath1 , the chain size parallel to the walls diverges logarithmically , @xmath2 with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding bond - bond correlation function decreases like a power law , @xmath4 with @xmath5 being the curvilinear distance between bonds and @xmath6 . upon increasing the film thickness , @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we find  in contrast to flory s hypothesis  the bulk exponent @xmath7 and , more importantly , a _ decreasing _ @xmath8 that gives direct evidence for an _ enhanced _ self - interaction of chain segments reflected at the walls . </S>",
    "<S> systematic deviations from the kratky plateau as a function of @xmath0 are found for the single chain form factor parallel to the walls in agreement with the _ non - monotonous _ behaviour predicted by theory . </S>",
    "<S> this structure in the kratky plateau might give rise to an erroneous estimation of the chain extension from scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> for large @xmath0 the deviations are linear with the wave vector , @xmath9 , but are very weak . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for ultrathin films , @xmath10 , very strong corrections are found ( albeit logarithmic in @xmath9 ) suggesting a possible experimental verification of our results . </S>"
