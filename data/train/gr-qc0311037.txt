    "<S> we present the preliminary results of the analysis to search for inspiraling compact binaries using tama300 dt8 data which was taken during 2003 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the quality and the stability of the data with that taken during dt6 in 2001 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dt8 data has better quality and stability than the dt6 data .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 cm    tama300 @xcite is an interferometric gravitational wave detector with @xmath0 m baseline length located at mitaka campus of the national astronomical observatory of japan in tokyo @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> tama300 began to operate in 1999 . </S>",
    "<S> it had performed observations for 8 times by july 2003 . in particular , during the period from 1 august to 20 september 2001 , tama300 performed an observation , which is called data taking 6 ( dt6 ) , and about 1039 hours of data were taken . </S>",
    "<S> the best sensitivity was about @xmath2 around @xmath3hz . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , a longer observation was performed by tama300 during 14 february to 15 april . </S>",
    "<S> 2003 , and about 1163 hours of data were taken . </S>",
    "<S> this observation is called data taking 8 ( dt8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the best sensitivity was about @xmath4 around @xmath5khz .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider gravitational waves from inspiraling compact binaries , consisting of neutron stars or black holes . </S>",
    "<S> since their wave forms are well known by post - newtonian approximation of general relativity , we can use the matched filtering . in this paper , we report some results applied to dt6 and dt8 data , and compare the stability of both observations . </S>",
    "<S> the data used for the analysis are that taken during 1 august to 20 september , 2001 ( dt6 ) , and during 14 february to 15 april , 2003 ( dt8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the length of data is 1039 hours and 1163 hours for dt6 and dt8 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these are the data after removing any unlocked period , the period when some adjustments were made , and the locked period continued only less than 10 minutes .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the time sequential data of the detector output @xmath6 consists of a signal plus noise @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the one - sided power spectrum density of noise by @xmath8 .    </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational wave strain amplitude @xmath9 is calculated by combining two independent modes of the gravitational wave and antenna pattern of interferometer as @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are two independent templates whose phase are different to @xmath13 from each other and @xmath14 is amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters which characterize the templates are the coalescence time @xmath15 , the chirp mass @xmath16 @xmath17 , non - dimensional reduced mass @xmath18 and the phase @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the details of the wave form can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use the restricted post - newtonian wave forms in which the phase evolution is calculated to 2.5 post - newtonian order , but the amplitude evolution contains only the lowest newtonian quadrupole contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of spin angular momentum are not taken into account here .    </S>",
    "<S> the two wave forms , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are transformed into the fourier domain by the stationary phase approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we use templates for matched filtering defined in the fourier domain as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath9 . here , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath24 and @xmath25 are normalized as @xmath26 @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and * means the operation to take the complex conjugate . </S>",
    "<S> the filtered output is then defined by @xmath29 in the matched filtering , we look for the maximum of @xmath30 over the parameter @xmath15 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath19 . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqn : rho ] ) , we can take the maximization over @xmath19 analytically which gives @xmath33 we see that @xmath34 has an expectation value @xmath35 in the presence of only gaussian noise . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can define the normalized signal - to - noise ratio by @xmath36 .    in the tama300 analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that the noise contained a large amount of non - stationary and non - gaussian noise @xcite . in order to remove the influence of such noise </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a @xmath37 test @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> first we divide each template into @xmath38 mutually independent pieces in the frequency domain , chosen so that the expected contribution to @xmath30 from each frequency band is approximately equal , as @xmath39 the @xmath37 is defined by @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eqn : chi}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 this quantity must satisfy the @xmath37-statistics with @xmath42 degrees of freedom , as long as the data consists of gaussian noise plus inspiraling signals . for convenience , we use the reduced @xmath43-square defined by @xmath44 . in this paper , we chose @xmath45 ( hereafter , @xmath37 means the reduced @xmath43-square ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath37 is independent of the amplitude of the signal as long as the template and the signal have an identical wave form . </S>",
    "<S> however , in reality , since the template and the signal have different value of parameters because of the discrete time step and discrete mass parameters we search , the value of @xmath37 becomes larger when the amplitude of signal becomes larger . </S>",
    "<S> in such situation , if we reject events simply by the value of @xmath37 , we may lose real events with large amplitude . in order to avoid this , </S>",
    "<S> we have been introducing a statistic , @xmath46 , in the tama300 data analysis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the event selection using @xmath46 is more efficient to detect events with large @xmath30 ( say , @xmath47 ) than the usual @xmath37 selection . </S>",
    "<S> further , by checking the galactic event detection efficiency , we have found that the detection efficiency increases about 20 % by the @xmath46 selection compared to the @xmath37 selection in the case if the threshold is @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> the mass parameters considered in this paper is @xmath49 , which is a typical mass region of neutron stars . in this region , a discrete mass parameter space is determined so that the maximum loss of snr due to discretization becomes less than @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> the parametrization of mass parameters are done based on @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the mass parameter space depends on the power spectrum of noise . </S>",
    "<S> averaged power spectrum of noise for each continuously locked segment was used to define the mass parameter space in each segments . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter space is not changed within the continuously locked segment . however , in order to take into account of the variation of the noise power spectrum with time , we use a different mass parameter space for different locked segments . </S>",
    "<S> the mass parameter space turned out to contain about @xmath51 templates for the dt6 data , and about @xmath52 templates for the dt8 data ( fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the typical value of the number of template is about 700 for dt6 , and 600 for dt8 . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of the number of template is not due to the variation of absolute amplitude of the power spectrum , but due to the variation of the shape of the power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can see an aspect of variation of the shape of the power spectrum from fig.1 . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that dt8 data are more stable than dt6 data with respect to the number of templates , which probably means the stability of dt8 data with respect to the shape of the power spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> next we examine the variation of total noise power . here </S>",
    "<S> , we define @xmath53^{-1/2}. \\label{eqn : p}\\ ] ] since this value is related to the normalization constant of the templates , this noise power is suited to examine the variation of the noise power spectrum used in the matched filtering . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath54 is evaluated for each data with length 1.1 minutes . here </S>",
    "<S> , we only consider the locked data . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , we plot the number of occurrence as a function of the value @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the mean value and standard deviation are @xmath55 , @xmath56 for dt6 and @xmath57 , @xmath58 for dt8 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the stability of dt8 data is better than that of dt6 data with respect to the amplitude of the noise power spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> next we present results of matched filtering analysis including preliminary results of dt8 analysis . after calculating eq.([eqn : rho2 ] ) for each mass parameter in the mass parameter space , </S>",
    "<S> we search for @xmath15 and masses which realize the maximum value of @xmath30 in each interval of the coalescence time with length @xmath59 msec . </S>",
    "<S> for those @xmath15 and masses , the value of the reduced @xmath43-square are calculated . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , we plot the number of events as a function of @xmath30 and @xmath60 . in these </S>",
    "<S> figure , only events with @xmath61 are plotted . </S>",
    "<S> we find from the distribution of @xmath30 that the dt8 result has longer tail than dt6 data . </S>",
    "<S> such events with large @xmath30 must be due to the non - gaussian noise since the value of @xmath60 of them are also very large . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution of @xmath60 is also more spread in dt8 case than in dt6 case . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in terms of the distribution of @xmath30 and @xmath60 , the stability of dt8 does not seem to be better than dt6 . </S>",
    "<S> however , most of events with large @xmath30 in dt8 have larger @xmath60 than that of dt6 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if we plot the number of events as a function of @xmath46 , we have a shorter tail in dt8 than in dt6 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be seen in fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> if we determine threshold of @xmath46 for a given false alarm rate , the threshold of dt8 becomes lower than that of dt6 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact will help us to improve the detection efficiency of the galactic events in dt8 further . </S>",
    "<S> these facts also suggest that the dt8 data have much better quality than the dt6 data in the sense that it is easier to discriminate the non - gaussian noise events .    </S>",
    "<S> after the observation of dt6 , the configuration of tama300 has been changed very much . </S>",
    "<S> one of the major changes is the installation of the power recycling system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it will be important and interesting to investigate the origin of the different property of data between dt6 and dt8 . </S>",
    "<S> we will work on such analysis in the future .    </S>",
    "<S> much more details of the analysis using the data of tama300 dt6 and dt8 will be discussed elsewhere @xcite .    </S>",
