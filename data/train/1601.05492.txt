    "asteroseismology is a very effective tool to determine stellar fundamental parameters , such as stellar mass , radius , and surface gravity .",
    "it is also a direct way to explore the internal structure and evolutionary status of stars when combined with stellar theoretical model .",
    "it has already been used as well to determine cluster fundamental parameters ( such as * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thanks to the space based observation space projects , such as _ corot _ @xcite , _ kepler _  @xcite , and the following k2 mission @xcite , more and more ultraprecise and long - term photometric time series have been obtained .",
    "they have revolutionized asteroseismology in many aspects , such as investigating the internal differential rotation of stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and probing the properties of the convective zone and overshooting ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ultimate goal of asteroseismology is to reveal the internal structure and evolutionary status of stars . to probe the internal structure or a specific physical process in a star ,",
    "however , we need to compare stellar theoretical models with observations of the star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "usually , the goodness of the matching between theoretical models and observations is evaluated through a @xmath0 method , which is defined as @xmath4 @xcite , where the superscript * obs * and * mod * represent the observations and theoretical model calculations of a quantity @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath6 denotes the uncertainty of observed quantity @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the total number of available observations of @xmath7 . obviously , a model with the minimum @xmath9 is the best matching model .    to obtain the best matching model , asteroseismic parameters ( mainly frequencies ) and non - asteroseismic parameters ( i.e. parameters of stellar atmosphere )",
    "are usually combined together to get a total residual error ( @xmath9 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "sometimes these two kinds of parameters are used separately ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the non - seismic parameters are used as a first constraint to narrow the model parameter range , and then the seismic parameters are used to find the best matching model ( i.e. , @xmath0-minimization model ) .",
    "owing to space - based observations ( such as _ corot _ , _ kepler _ , and k2 ) , dozens of oscillation frequencies can be obtained for a pulsating star ( such as solar - like stars ) with extraordinarily high precision .",
    "the errors of those observed frequencies are usually much smaller than those of non - asteroseismic parameters ( e.g. effective temperature @xmath10 , luminosity @xmath11 , and metal abundance [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "however , such high precision of asteroseismic data will be deteriorated by low precision of non - asteroseismic parameters , when they are used together .",
    "therefore , the precision of the final result will be reduced .    in practice",
    ", theoretical models also possess considerable errors .",
    "the definition of @xmath9 ( equation ) should therefore be modified as : @xmath12 but what does such matching process tell us about the observed star ? or , in other words , what physical parameters of the observed star can be determined best with such a method ? in this letter , we try to answer this question , using only asteroseismic parameters of a solar - like star kic 6225718 .",
    "the theory of stellar structure and evolution tells us that the precision of theoretical models of a star is affected by the space resolution of stellar structure and time resolution of stellar evolution when the input physics and initial parameters are fixed . in this section",
    ", we will discuss the influences coming from both of them .",
    "we use the modules of experiments in stellar astrophysics ( mesa ) evolutionary code , which is developed by @xcite , to calculate theoretical models .",
    "it can be used to calculate stellar evolutionary models and their corresponding oscillation information @xcite .",
    "we use the package *  pulse \" * of version *  v6208 \" * to make our calculations for both stellar evolution and oscillations @xcite .    based on the default parameters , we adopt the opal opacity table gs98 @xcite series .",
    "we choose eddington grey - atmosphere @xmath13 relation as the stellar atmosphere model , and treat the convection zone by the standard mixing - length theory ( mlt ) of @xcite with @xmath14=2.0 .",
    "we treat the element diffusion in our model calculations according to @xcite . for convective core overshooting",
    ", @xcite suggested that it is between 0 and 0.2@xmath15 and its effect can be ignored .",
    "we hence do not consider it in our model calculations .",
    "in addition , the semi - convection , thermohaline mixing , and mass loss are not included in this work .      for a low - mass main - sequence star ( such as kic 6225718 ) , the radial nodes @xmath16 of observable oscillation modes are around 20 .",
    "moreover , such radial nodes almost distribute over the whole stellar interior . in order to discuss the influence of space resolution on the stellar structure and on its oscillations , we compare two models that consist of 1800 and 3500 shells , respectively . finally , we find that the discrepancies between them are on the order of 0.04 @xmath17hz for oscillation frequencies and 0.027 for @xmath2 , when we match our theoretical models with the observations of kic 6225718 .",
    "therefore , a spacial resolution of about 2000 shells is sufficient to identify accurate stellar models for such a star .",
    "based on the above input physics , we calculate stellar evolution models and their oscillation frequencies of four initial combinations of mass @xmath18 and initial heavy element mass fraction @xmath19 .",
    "they are ( 1.08 m@xmath20 , 0.012 ) , ( 1.10 m@xmath20 , 0.012 ) , ( 1.08 m@xmath20 , 0.010 ) , and ( 1.10 m@xmath20 , 0.014 ) , respectively . in order to check the effect of the time resolution",
    ", we assign three different values to the time step of evolution .",
    "they are @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 years , respectively .",
    "finally , we calculate @xmath2 value for each model on those tracks with respect to the 33 observed frequencies of kic 6225718 @xcite via equation and show them in figure [ fig - chi ] , where each line corresponds to one evolutionary track . in addition , the @xmath2-minimization model of every evolutionary track is also decided .",
    "it can be seen in figure [ fig - chi ] that the time resolution of stellar evolution significantly affects the position of the best matching models in the @xmath2 diagram .",
    "the @xmath2-profile with the time step of @xmath21 years show some irregular variations . for shorter time steps ,",
    "the @xmath2-profile become more and more regular and tend to converge .",
    "panels ( a ) to ( d ) in figure [ fig - chi ] also show that different time resolutions lead to distributions of @xmath2 with great diversity .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath2 value indicates how good a model represents the observations .",
    "large diversity and irregular variations of @xmath2 thus indicate that the time resolution affects the precision of stellar models .",
    "it can be noticed that a too low time resolution in stellar evolution calculations may lead to wrong selection of the best matching model .",
    "when the time resolution increases to @xmath23 years , the @xmath2-profile begins to converge to a regular `` v '' shape , which defines a unique minimum @xmath2 .",
    "this characteristic removes any ambiguity of how to select the best matching model and ensures that only one model can be selected as the best matching one for a specific evolutionary track . by comparing two models that have time resolutions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 years respectively , we find that there is 0.035 @xmath17hz for the frequencies , which translates into 0.024 for @xmath2 . at this moment",
    "the precision of theoretical models are higher than that of observations .    according to the stellar oscillation theory ,",
    "p - mode oscillations are basically acoustic waves .",
    "their properties can be roughly characterized by the acoustic radius @xmath1 , which is defined as @xmath25 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath26 is the adiabatic sound speed and @xmath27 is the stellar radius .",
    "the acoustic radius @xmath1 is an important parameter in asteroseismology .",
    "for instance , @xcite and @xcite used it as a reference to show the position of the base of convective envelope and the position of helium ionization zone .",
    "equation shows that @xmath1 is determined by stellar radius @xmath27 and the profile of adiabatic sound speed @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , such `` v '' shapes in @xmath29 may also appear in @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( see figures [ fig - chi](e)-[fig - chi](h ) ) .",
    "it can be found from figures [ fig - chi](e ) and [ fig - chi](f ) that the stellar radius @xmath27 dominantly determines @xmath2 to vary with `` v '' shape , while the profile of sound speed @xmath26 fine tunes the minimum of @xmath2 to be located at almost the same value of the acoustic radius @xmath1 .",
    "in addition , figures [ fig - chi](f)-[fig - chi](h ) show that such regular `` v '' shape gradually disappears when the time step of stellar evolution increases . for low - mass main sequence stars ,",
    "the order of @xmath23 years for the time resolution is available to obtain accurate enough stellar evolutionary models .",

    "they are indicated as filled symbols in figure [ fig - chi](a ) .",
    "the cmms of all evolutionary tracks are shown in figure [ fig.tau.cmm ] .",
    "figure [ fig.tau.evol](a ) indicates that @xmath2 profiles of all calculated evolutionary tracks almost overlap with each other when they are plotted against the acoustic radius @xmath31 .",
    "they individual cmms all have an acoustic radius of @xmath47 seconds . on the other hand",

    "we conclude that the acoustic radius is global model parameter that can be determined best from matching observed frequencies with theoretical ones .",
    "figure [ fig.tau.cmm](a ) shows that the distribution of cmms ( @xmath48 ) looks like a ladle .",
    "most of the models are located in the bowl - shaped part and the rest form the handle . in figure [ fig.tau.cmm](b ) , those cmms are divided into two parts by a dashed line of @xmath49 .",

    "these facts indicate that parameters such as the stellar mass @xmath18 and metal abundance @xmath19 may slightly affect the determination of the acoustic radius @xmath1 , and their influences are mainly to enlarge uncertainty on the lower acoustic radius @xmath1 end .",
