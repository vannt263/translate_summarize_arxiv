    "throughout the physical and biological sciences , diffusive transport is ubiquitous , and it takes places on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales . for example , in biology diffusion is a key transport process that regulates events and interactions on levels ranging from those describing the behaviours of ions and subcellular macromolecules , to those of cells , tissues and organisms  @xcite .",
    "less well understood , however , is how volume - exclusion - driven crowding impacts upon these diffusive transport processes , despite the inherent fact that all diffusing particles exclude other particles from occupying the same region in space  @xcite .",
    "the majority of models of diffusive processes neglect to take into account excluded volume effects .",
    "the predominant models describing diffusive transport over a range of spatial scales , and with varying excluded volume fractions , are ` diffusion ' partial differential equation ( pde ) models with a constant diffusion coefficient  @xcite , and random - walk - based models of point particles  @xcite , both of which entirely neglect the impact of volume exclusion .",
    "other models include phenomenological descriptions of volume exclusion effects by imposing that , for example , the diffusion coefficients of pde models or the ` jump rates ' associated with random walk models depend locally on the particle density  @xcite .",
    "however , these phenomenological descriptions are usually chosen on an _ ad hoc _ basis , and the ramifications of choosing one description over another rarely explored in detail .    in this work",
    "we employ the framework of a lattice - based random walk to explore how volume exclusion may be taken into account at different spatial scales , and describe how to define the jump rates of the random walkers so as to provide a consistent description of the effects of volume exclusion across spatial scales .",
    "an additional advantage of our approach is that it provides for significant time savings in the computational simulation of volume excluding individual - particle - level models of diffusive transport .",
    "for simplicity , we consider a one - dimensional , lattice - based random walk model of diffusive transport in which the motile particles have length @xmath0 .",
    "we work with the domain @xmath1 $ ] , where @xmath2 for some @xmath3 , so that the domain can hold at most @xmath4 particles .",
    "we impose a uniform lattice consisting of @xmath5 compartments on the domain , so that the length of each compartment is @xmath6 , and we work only with choices of @xmath5 for which @xmath7 is a positive integer .",
    "this means that @xmath8 and at most @xmath9 particles fit into each of the @xmath5 compartments  @xcite .",
    "we model diffusion as a series of jumps between compartments , and impose zero - flux boundary conditions on the domain ( so that particle number is conserved ) .",
    "increases , the spatial resolution coarsens , and this work reconciles the descriptions at these different scales . ]    we move between different levels of spatial resolution by varying the compartment capacity , @xmath9 : smaller values of @xmath9 resolve changes in particle density on a finer spatial scale than larger values .",
    "the two limiting cases are : full exclusion , @xmath10 , so that compartments contain at most one particle ( and the position of the particle is fixed ) ; and no exclusion , @xmath11 , so there is no limit on the number of particles per compartment . in this work",
    ", we shall term the @xmath10 case ` accurate ' , in the sense that no assumptions are made on the positions of particles with each compartment .    the common , phenomenological approach taken in the literature",
    "is to define the jump rates between compartments as @xmath12 , \\quad j=1,\\ldots , k,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the number of particles in compartment @xmath14 when each compartment has capacity @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath15 describes the effects of volume exclusion , effectively specifying the proportion of jumps that ` fail ' due to crowding  @xcite .",
    "the scaling of the jump rate with the square of the compartment size ( @xmath16 ) can be justified from mean first passage time approaches  @xcite .",
    "effects such as adhesion are often included by assuming the @xmath17 to also be a function of @xmath18 and @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "typically , these models on different scales are interrogated either by : ( i ) using repeated simulation of the random walk models to estimate summary statistics of interest ; ( ii ) deriving and solving ordinary differential equations ( odes ) for the expected particle number per compartment ; or ( iii ) deriving pde models in the limit @xmath20 and using standard analytical and numerical techniques for pdes to explore model behaviours .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there has been little exploration of the effects of choosing different functional forms for @xmath15 on various summary statistics of the random walk models as the compartment capacity , @xmath9 , varies . as such ,",
    "one of the aims of this work is to understand how the mean and variance of particle numbers changes as we move across spatial scales ( by varying @xmath9 ) and to provide a systematic derivation of coarse - grained ( @xmath21 ) models from the accurate ( @xmath10 ) model .",
    "sensible choices of @xmath15 require :    1 .",
    "the volume exclusion function to be zero when the compartment is empty , @xmath22 ; 2 .",
    "the volume exclusion function to be unity when the compartment is at capacity , @xmath23 .",
    "one of the goals of this work is to elucidate functional forms for @xmath15 that give rise to behaviours that are conserved across spatial scales .",
