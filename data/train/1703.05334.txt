    "we employ simple gradient descent algorithm @xmath77 where @xmath78 is called the learning rate .",

    "<S> our machine - learning approach to qst is realized in two steps . </S>",
    "<S> first , an rbm is trained on a dataset consisting of a series of independent density measurements @xmath16 in some given basis @xmath17 of the @xmath18-body quantum system . </S>",
    "<S> if the target state is not positive - definite , additional estimates of the sign ( phase ) of the wave - function are required . </S>",
    "<S> once trained , the rbm approximates the wave - function underlying the dataset , and can be sampled to determine properties of interest for the physical system under investigation ( see supplementary material ) . </S>",
    "<S> the accuracy of the reconstruction can be systematically improved by increasing the number of hidden neurons @xmath19 in the rbm for fixed @xmath18 , or equivalently the density of hidden units @xmath20.@xcite    to demonstrate the power of this approach , we first consider qst of the @xmath0 state , a paradigmatic @xmath18-qubit multipartite entangled wave - function defined as @xmath21 to mimic the experimental measurements , we generate several datasets with an increasing number of synthetic density measurements obtained by sampling from the @xmath0 state . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements are used to train the rbm model . after the training , </S>",
    "<S> we sample states ( i.e.  configurations of the neurons in the visible layer ) from the rbm and build the histogram of the relative frequency of the superimposed states appearing in @xmath22 . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1](b ) we show three histograms obtained with a different number of samples in the training dataset for @xmath2 , and for a fixed density of hidden variables @xmath23 . from the histograms </S>",
    "<S> , we see that upon increasing the number of samples each of the @xmath18 components @xmath24 contribute equally to the wave - function , as expected from the exact @xmath0 state . </S>",
    "<S> to better quantify the quality of our reconstruction we then compute the overlap @xmath25 of the wave - function generated by the rbm with the original @xmath0 state ( see suppl . mat . ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1](a ) we plot the overlap as a function of the number of samples in the training datasets for three different values of @xmath18 , showing that for a system size substantially larger than what is currently available in experiments,@xcite an overlap @xmath26 can be achieved with a limited number of samples .        </S>",
    "<S> our approach can be extended to the case in which the target state is not positive - definite . for simplicity , we assume that the state can be gauged into a real - valued form , and that it is experimentally feasible to estimate the sign of the many - body state on a given set of kets @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , this could be realized through a weak measurement in the @xmath17 basis followed by a strong measurement in a chosen complementary basis . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite qst is then realized training two rbm s , one to learn the amplitude @xmath28 , and an additional one to learn the sign @xmath6 of the wave - function ( see suppl . mat . ) . after the training </S>",
    "<S> , the two networks are combined together to sample the full wave - function @xmath29 . to demonstrate this approach , </S>",
    "<S> we have performed a reconstruction of the @xmath0 state in the @xmath30 basis , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a hadamard gate applied to qubit @xmath33 . the rotated @xmath34 state features a non - trivial sign structure , and is therefore a good test case for qst . </S>",
    "<S> we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figure1](c ) the sign @xmath6 of each ket @xmath7 in @xmath8 and see that it closely matches the sign learned by the rbm ( fig .  [ figure1](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the overall scheme has an accuracy similar to the positive - definite case , with the overlap closely approaching unity on system sizes @xmath35 for which a direct , exact sampling from the rotated @xmath34 state is still possible .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the case of more complex systems and demonstrate qst for genuine many - body problems . to mimic experimental outcomes , we generate artificial datasets sampling the ground - state of interacting spin models on a lattice . </S>",
    "<S> these are directly relevant for quantum simulators based on ultra - cold ions and atoms . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we consider the transverse - field ising model ( tfim ) with hamiltonian @xmath36 and the xxz spin-@xmath37 model , with hamiltonian @xmath38\\label{eq : xxz}\\ ] ] where the @xmath39 are pauli spin operators .    </S>",
    "<S> for each hamiltonian we consider both a 1-dimensional ( 1d ) chain with @xmath18 sites and a 2-dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice with linear extent @xmath40 and @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> for the tfim , there exists a quantum critical point @xmath42 in the transverse field dividing a disordered paramagnetic phase ( @xmath43 ) from an ordered ferromagnetic phase ( @xmath44 ) , while the xxz model undergoes a quantum phase transition at a critical value @xmath45 of the anisotropy from a disordered phase ( @xmath46 ) to a magnetically ordered phase ( @xmath47 ) . </S>",
    "<S> synthetic measurements in this case are obtained with standard quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods,@xcite stochastically sampling the exact ground - state of hamiltonians in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : tfim],[eq : xxz ] ) for different values of the coupling parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> since in this case the many - body ground - state is positive - definite , our reconstruction scheme does not require extra measurements of the many - body phase . </S>",
    "<S> once the training is complete , we can test the representational power of the neural networks by computing various observables using the rbms and comparing with the values obtained through qmc simulations.@xcite    we begin by considering few - body observables , such as magnetization and spin correlations . for the tfim we first look at the longitudinal @xmath50 magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> because this observable is diagonal in the basis adopted for training , the problem reduces to a purely classical one  @xcite and we can easily compute the expectation value from the configurations of the visible layer , sampled from the trained rbm . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ observables ] ( * a*-*b * ) for one and two dimensions , the rbms can reproduce the average values with high accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the case of the transverse @xmath51 magnetization , which is off - diagonal in the training basis . </S>",
    "<S> one can obtain the expectation value by computing the local estimate of the observable as in variational monte carlo simulations ( see suppl . ) . even though reproducing this off - diagonal observable is non - trivial , the rbm can nonetheless generate values in agreement with qmc calculations . </S>",
    "<S> for the xxz model , we show in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ observables ] ( * c * ) the expectation values of the diagonal @xmath52 and off - diagonal @xmath53 spin correlations , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 being neighbors along the lattice diagonal . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider the full spin - spin @xmath56 correlation function for the 1d - tfim , which involves non - local correlations . in fig .  [ tomography ] we show the reconstruction of the correlation function using the rbm ( * a * ) closely matching the exact result obtained by direct computation from the spin states making up the training dataset ( * b * ) .     between the rbms ( markers ) and results obtained via exact diagonalization ( dashed lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> * a ) * 1d - tfim at three different values of the transverse field , @xmath57 ( red squares ) , @xmath58 ( blue circles ) and @xmath59 ( green diamonds ) with @xmath2 spins . </S>",
    "<S> * b ) * 1d heisenberg model ( @xmath60 ) with @xmath2 spins ( blue circles ) . ]    to further assess the capabilities of our approach , we finally turn to the entanglement entropy , which is a highly non - local quantity particularly challenging for direct experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> it provides important information on the universal behavior of interacting many - body systems and it is of central interest in condensed matter physics and quantum information theory . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement entropy has been computed numerically for various physical systems,@xcite however its highly non - local nature makes it very challenging to measure in experiments.@xcite following the method proposed here , we can obtain an estimate of this quantity given only simple measurements of the density , which are more accessible with current experimental advances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> given a bipartition of the physical system , we consider in particular the second renyi entropy defined as @xmath61 , with the subsystem @xmath62 of varying size . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate @xmath63 by employing an improved ratio trick sampling  @xcite using the wave - function generated by the rbm . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ entropy ] we show the entanglement entropy for the 1d - tfim ( * a * ) for three values of the transverse field , and for the critical ( @xmath64 ) 1d - xxz model ( * b * ) . in both instances </S>",
    "<S> we took a chain with @xmath2 spins and plot the entanglement entropy as a function of the subsystem size @xmath65 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the values obtained with the rbm ( markers ) are compared with results from exact diagonalization ( dashed lines ) , with an overall good agreement .    to conclude , we have demonstrated that ml tools can be efficiently used to reconstruct complex many - body quantum states from a limited number of experimental measurements . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme is general enough to be efficiently applied to a variety of quantum devices for which current approaches demand exponentially large resources . </S>",
    "<S> these include qst of highly - entangled quantum circuits , adiabatic quantum simulators,@xcite experiments with ultra - cold atoms and ions traps in higher dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> our approach can be used to directly validate quantum computers and simulators , as well as to indirectly reconstruct quantities which are experimentally challenging for a direct observation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we anticipate that the current generation of quantum microscopes could substantially benefit from neural - quantum states qst . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we predict that the use of our approach for bosonic ultra - cold atoms experiments would allow for the determination of the entanglement entropy on systems substantially larger than those currently accessible with quantum interference techniques .      </S>",
