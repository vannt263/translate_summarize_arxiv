    "three years ago , geim , novoselov and co - workers have succeeded in isolating and contacting a single layer of graphite ( graphene).@xcite contrary to common wisdom , this experiment showed that true two - dimensional lattices are thermodynamically stable .",
    "@xcite this stability comes about because the system gently crumples to the third direction forming ripples .",
    "@xcite it is therefore an important problem to study the effect of out - plane phonons on the electronic properties of the system .",
    "contrary to two - dimensional electron - systems in semiconductor heterostructures , where ( scalar ) electrons interact with bulk@xcite or surface@xcite phonons , in graphene there are two - dimensional in - plane as well as out - of - plane vibrational modes to which dirac ( spinor ) fermions will couple .",
    "there are two different vertex - types modeling the interaction of electrons with optical phonons .",
    "first , due to the atomic displacement within the plane , the tunneling - matrix element between two carbon atoms varies .",
    "this gives rise to a su - schrieffer - heeger type coupling ( current - current coupling).@xcite the two - dimensional gauge field is composed by the longitudinal optical ( lo ) and transverse optical ( to ) phonons which are degenerate at @xmath1 .",
    "this vertex type is also found from symmetry arguments.@xcite there are also out - of - plane vibrations .",
    "these lattice displacements are symmetric with respect to their neighboring atoms and thus couple to the electronic densities .",
    "the optical ( zo ) modes can then be described within the holstein model.@xcite for a recent account on the green s function of the holstein polaron , see ref . @xcite and references therein .",
    "out - of - plane modes are energetically smaller than in - plane vibrations due to the hybridization of the @xmath2-orbitals within the graphene sheet .",
    "a tight - binding calculation including nearest and second - nearest neighbors yields @xmath3 for the optical branch close to the @xmath4-point.@xcite for a first - principle calculation of the phonon - spectra , see the work by wirtz and rubio.@xcite the effect of the electron - phonon coupling on the local density of states of zig - zag graphene ribbons has been studied by sasaki _",
    "et al._.@xcite the effect of the optical phonons on the raman spectrum of disordered graphene was studied by castro neto and guinea . @xcite",
    "the effect of holstein phonons on transport properties has been receiving renewed interest in the context of the one - dimensional holstein - hubbard model.@xcite here , we will discuss holstein phonons in graphene for the following reason .",
    "it is currently believed that transport properties can be well described within a semi - classical boltzmann approach.@xcite this implies well - defined quasi - particles , i.e. , only one band is considered and inter - band transitions are ruled out . doing so , several scattering mechanisms have been discussed , ranging from local defects ( vacancies or substitutions ) , long - ranged coulomb impurities in the substrate or due to adsorbed atoms to acoustical phonons.@xcite    optical phonons can not be treated within the one - band boltzmann approach@xcite since they would induce interband - transitions at typical densities of @xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "it is therefore crucial to assess this scattering mechanism via the kubo - formalism . in section",
    "ii , we present our model for holstein phonons and calculate the electronic self - energy within the first born approximation in section iii .",
    "we further compute the optical conductivity in section iv , using the full greens function , but neglecting vertex corrections .",
    "we close with conclusions and outlook .",
    "in two - dimensional graphene sheets , first - principle calculations reveal that the born - oppenheimer approximation is not valid for doped graphene sheets.@xcite frhlich polarons@xcite are thus not a good starting point to describe electron - lattice interaction in graphene . here",
    ", we present the study of the electron - lattice coupling due to localized holstein - phonons in a two - dimensional honeycomb lattice , thus treating the zo - phonons ( out - of - plane vibrations ) .    the honeycomb lattice ( the lattice of graphene )",
    "is made of two interpenetrating triangular lattices , defining two non - equivalent sites , usually labeled as @xmath7 and @xmath8 sites.@xcite the model hamiltonian for zo - polarons in graphene reads as follows : @xmath9 + \\sum_{\\bm q}\\omega_{\\bm q}c^\\dag_{\\bm q}c_{\\bm q } + v_{ep } \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) creates an electron at an atom of the @xmath7(b ) sub - lattice and @xmath12 are creation phonon operators .",
    "the energy @xmath13 is the dispersion of the zo - phonon and @xmath14 the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "we model the coupling to the zo - phonons as the usually density - density coupling@xcite @xmath15q_j\\,,\\ ] ] with @xmath16 defined as @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 the ion s mass and @xmath20 the number of unit cells in the crystal .",
    "note that we couple the density with respect to the half - filled band such that particle - hole symmetry is conserved by reversing the sign of the coupling constant . in the following ,",
    "though , we shall neglect this shift in the bosonic operators .",
    "the effect of holstein polarons is obtained using @xmath21 and transforming the operators in hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) to momentum space .",
    "this gives @xmath22 with @xmath23 , @xmath24 the vectors connecting the three nearest neighbors on the honeycomb lattice , and @xmath14 given by @xmath25    let us comment on the coupling constant @xmath26 . due to the mirror symmetry of the graphene - sheet , one might think that the linear coupling to lattice displacements is zero .",
    "but the mirror symmetry is broken for samples where graphene lies on top of a sio@xmath27- or sic - substrate ( for a discussion , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . to quantify the coupling constant in terms of the dimensionless constant @xmath28",
    ", we assume that the coupling mechanism is due to a variation of the hopping matrix element .",
    "this yields @xmath29 of the order of unity.@xcite",
    "if the phonon energy scale is much smaller than the electronic energy scale , migdal s theorem states that it is sufficient to calculate the lowest - order self - energy diagram.@xcite this diagram can further be calculated using the bare electron greens function .",
    "still , the importance of electron - phonon coupling also depends on the dimensionality of the system .",
    "e.g. , in self - assembled quantum dots , vertex ",
    "corrections  to the polarization of an electron - hole pair give rise to charge - cancellation,@xcite thus changing the optical conductivity significantly.@xcite also for @xmath30 ( @xmath7=k , rb)@xcite and for general one - dimensional systems,@xcite migdal s theorem is not valid .",
    "furthermore , electron - electron interaction can affect the effective electron - phonon interaction.@xcite    in graphene sheets , electron - electron interaction is generally neglected , i.e. , one assumes a `` normal '' ground - state at zero doping ( one electron per unit cell ) - characterized by a semi - metal . since the average kinetic and interaction energy per particle both scale with @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the carrier density , the interaction does not become important at finite doping , either .",
    "electron - electron interaction is also neglected in recent works on localization@xcite even though disorder enhances the effect of interaction.@xcite the same should hold for the electron - phonon vertex corrections which results in an effective electron - electron interaction and we thus believe that the assumption of migdal s theory is a good starting point to discuss the holstein - phonons in graphene .",
    "because of the existence of two sub - lattices , the green s function needs to be written as a @xmath33 matrix : @xmath34 with @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the `` imaginary '' time , and @xmath37 is the time ordering operator .",
    "up to second order in perturbation theory , and after transforming the time dependence of the green s function to matsubara frequencies , we obtain the following result : @xmath38 where the matrix @xmath39 is defined as @xmath40 and the matrix element @xmath41 is defined by ( @xmath42 ) @xmath43    because both @xmath44 and @xmath45 are momentum independent , i.e. , we set @xmath46 and the phonon propagator @xmath45 is given by @xmath47 the matrix elements of the self energy matrix can be written in a simplified form , reading @xmath48 where @xmath49 is @xmath44 with @xmath13 replaced by @xmath50 .",
    "notice that we neglected the constant shift in the self - energy due to the shift of the bosonic displacement operator , still present in eq .",
    "( [ label : selfenergy ] ) .",
    "this is consistent since we also neglected the hartree correction to the self energy .    from the above",
    "we can write down a dyson equation for the electronic propagator , given by @xmath51 which has to be solved for @xmath52 .",
    "the equation giving the matsubara green s function for the free electronic system reads @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the @xmath55 unit matrix . within the dirac cone approximation , which applies in a range of 1 ev",
    ", one has @xmath56 .",
    "also the following result holds @xmath57 leading to a simplified form for the dyson equation ( [ dyson ] ) , which can be readily solved , giving @xmath58 the matrix elements of eq .",

    "close to the dirac point , the dispersion is simply given by @xmath72 where the upper ( lower ) sign holds for electrons ( holes ) and we obtain the new energy spectrum @xmath73 from @xmath74 for the conduction band and @xmath75 for the valence band .",
