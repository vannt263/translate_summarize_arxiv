    "as was first pointed out by helfrich and mller,@xcite the high - temperature graphs of o(@xmath1 ) spin models describe in addition to the particle trajectories at the same time a second set of _ physical _ lines . in this section ,",
    "we briefly discuss examples in @xmath481 and 4 , respectively .",

    "domain walls_,@xcite separating geometrical spin clusters of opposite orientation on the dual lattice .",
    "each bond in a high - temperature graph cuts a nearest neighbor pair of anti - parallel spins on the dual lattice in two .",
    "the link connecting the two anti - parallel spins on the dual lattice is perpendicular to the high - temperature bond on the original lattice . on an infinite lattice",
    ", the kramers - wannier duality implies that observables calculated at an inverse temperature @xmath201 in the original ising model can be transcribed to those of the dual model at an inverse temperature @xmath482 .",
    "the duality map interchanges the low - temperature and high - temperature phases .",
    "the relation between the two temperatures is readily established by noting that an occupied high - temperature bond represents a factor @xmath483 .",
    "the anti - parallel spin pair on the dual lattice , that is cut by the high - temperature bond , carries a boltzmann weight @xmath484 , so that@xcite @xmath485 or @xmath486 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath487 follows from this relation by setting @xmath488 , with the result @xmath489        we next consider the three - dimensional o(2 ) model .",
    "the fractal dimension of the corresponding high - temperature graphs has been estimated in a recent monte carlo study@xcite as @xmath491 at the critical point . by a duality map,@xcite",
    "these high - temperature graphs describe at the same time the magnetic vortex lines of the three - dimensional higgs model ( [ higgs ] ) .",
    "vortices constitute the topological defects of the higgs model and are line - like in three dimensions .",
    "the duality map again interchanges the low - temperature and high - temperature phases of the two models .",
    "given the values@xcite @xmath492 and @xmath493 of the o(2 ) model obtained through monte carlo simulations , the relations ( [ etavartheta ] ) and ( [ nu ] ) lead to the values @xmath494 for the configurational entropy exponents of closed and open magnetic vortices , @xmath7 and @xmath275 , respectively , and for the exponent @xmath191 , characterizing the vanishing of the line tension when the critical point is approached .",
    "the estimate for @xmath275 was first given in ref .",
    "from the perspective of vortices , the phase diagram of the three - dimensional higgs model is as follows . for convenience , we take the model as effective theory of ordinary type - ii superconductors in three space dimensions . whereas in the superconducting phase only a few small vortex loops are present , the density and size of the loops increase when the temperature rises .",
    "loops of all sizes appear at the critical point , and the vacuum becomes filled with vortex loops .",
    "the disordering effect of the proliferating vortices destroys the superconducting phase and drives the phase transition to the normal phase . because of the meissner effect , the magnetic interaction is screened in the superconducting phase and vortex line elements experience only a short range interaction which is well approximated by a steric repulsion .",
    "this is precisely the type of interaction experienced by the high - temperature graphs of the o(2 ) model .    the three - dimensional o(2 ) model also possesses vortex lines as topological solutions .",
    "in contrast to those in a superconductor , the vortices in a superfluid experience a long range interaction , mediated by the gapless goldstone mode associated with the spontaneous breaking of the o(2 ) symmetry in the @xmath180 theory .",
    "the model whose high - temperature graphs describe these vortices is the higgs model , as follows again from the duality map.@xcite the long range interaction experienced by the high - temperature graphs of the higgs model is the biot - savart interaction discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : higgs ] .",
    "the duality between the o(2 ) and the higgs models implies that the particle trajectories of one model appear as vortex lines in the other.@xcite    it was first suggested by onsager@xcite that proliferating vortex loops drive the superfluid phase transition in liquid @xmath3he .",
    "he envisaged that as the critical temperature is approached from below , the vortex loops proliferateloop!proliferation and thereby disorder the superfluid state , causing the system to revert to the normal state .",
    "the precise nature of the three - dimensional superfluid phase transition was recently investigated from this perspective in a recent high - precision monte carlo study.@xcite one of the observables considered is the total vortex line density @xmath495 . by means of standard finite - size scaling analysis of the corresponding susceptibility @xmath496 the inverse critical temperature @xmath497 was estimated and shown to be consistent with the estimate of a previous study directly in terms of the field variables.@xcite however , when percolation observables were considered , such as the probability for the presence of a vortex loop spanning the lattice , slight but statistically significant deviations from @xmath497 were found . for all observables considered , the vortex proliferation threshold @xmath498 is larger than @xmath497 .",
    "that is , from these observables one would conclude that the vortices proliferate too early at a temperature below the critical one . from the duality map alluded to above , the vortex proliferation threshold is expected to coincide with the critical point .",
    "it is not clear at the moment , whether this discrepancy is physical , or an artifact of the percolation observables used . with the percolation threshold taken as an adjustable parameter",
    ", reasonable estimates were obtained from percolation observables for the critical exponents @xmath282 and @xmath201 , consistent with those of the xy model.@xcite    even in systems without a thermodynamic phase transition , the notion of vortex proliferation can be useful in understanding the phase structure .",
    "an example is provided by the three - dimensional abelian higgs lattice model with _ compact _",
    "gauge field ( see below).@xcite in addition to vortices , the compact model also features magnetic monopoles as topological defects , which are point - like in three dimensions . in the presence of monopoles ,",
    "vortex lines no longer need to be closed as they can originate at a monopole and terminate at an antimonopole .",
    "when the vortex line tension is finite , monopoles and antimonopoles are tightly bound in pairs .",
    "the part of phase diagram where this is the case is called the higgs region , which corresponds to the superconducting phase in the noncompact theory . when the vortex line tension vanishes , monopoles and antimonopoles are no longer bound in pairs , and instead form a plasma . in the part of the phase diagram where this is the case",
    ", the system exhibits charge confinement .",
    "it is well established that one can move from the higgs region into the confining region without encountering thermodynamic singularities.@xcite the susceptibility data for various observables define , however , a precisely located phase boundary .",
    "more specifically , for sufficiently large lattices , the maxima of the susceptibilities at the phase boundary do not show any finite - size scaling , and the susceptibility data obtained on different lattice sizes collapse onto single curves without rescaling , indicating that the infinite - volume limit is reached . in ref .",
    "[ ] , it was argued that this phase boundary marks the vortex proliferation threshold .",
    "a well - defined and precisely located phase boundary across which geometrical objects proliferate , yet thermodynamic quantities remain nonsingular has become known as a _",
    "kertsz line_. such a line was first introduced in the context of the ising model in the presence of an applied magnetic field.@xcite      as a last example , we consider the four - dimensional _ pure compact _",

    "the link variable is related to the continuum gauge field @xmath506 via @xmath507 the lattice action ( [ sg ] ) reduces to the ordinary maxwell action in the continuum limit @xmath27 , provided one sets @xmath508 as for the compact higgs model , the pure compact gauge theory possesses point - like monopoles in three dimensions . in four dimensions ,",
    "these defects become line - like.@xcite the monopole loops experience in addition to a steric repulsion also a long range biot - savart interaction .",
    "the field theory in which these monopole lines appear as particle trajectories ( high - temperature graphs ) is the four - dimensional noncompact higgs model ( [ higgs]).@xcite that is , the pure compact u(1 ) lattice gauge theory is dual to the noncompact higgs model .",
    "these models possess two phases .",
    "the pure compact u(1 ) theory has a confining phase at strong coupling ( small @xmath201 ) , corresponding to the superconducting .",
    "phase of the higgs model . , and a coulomb phase at weak coupling ( large @xmath201 ) characterized by a massless photon .",
    "monte carlo simulations@xcite show that in the coulomb phase only a few small monopole loops are present . with increasing coupling constant ( decreasing @xmath201 )",
    ", the density and size of the loops increase . at the critical point very close to @xmath509 ,",
    "the monopole loops proliferate and thereby disorder the system.@xcite the coulomb phase gives way to the strong - coupling confining phase , where the vacuum is filled with a spaghetti of tangled monopole loops .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the monopole loops drive the phase transition , i.e. , the monopole loops proliferate right at the confinement phase transition.@xcite in showing this , percolation observables of the type discussed here have been used.@xcite the order of the phase transition is not an established fact . in case",
    "it is continuous , the relations between the fractal structure of loops and the critical exponents laid out in these notes also apply here .      besides picturing the worldlines of the particles described by the field theory under consideration",
    ", the high - temperature graphs can have a second interpretation as topological line defects , such as peierls domains walls @xmath510 , vortices @xmath511 , or monopole lines @xmath512 .",
    "the field theory in which such line - like configurations appear as topological defects is said to be dual to the original one .",
