    "it is broadly recognized that most complex systems in nature are organized as intricated network patterns @xcite .",
    "this observation has triggered an intense research effort aimed at understanding the organizing principles of these networks , their structural properties , and the interplay between topology and dynamics @xcite .",
    "it was recently recognized that the classical models of random networks developed in graph theory were unable to describe the random but structured , hierarchical network patterns found in nature . since then , a number of paradigmatic models ( as small - world and scale - free nets @xcite ) have seen the light .",
    "they mimic some of the striking properties observed in real complex networks . in any case ,",
    "network structures play an important role in many contexts ranging from brain neural circuits , cellular function webs , ecosystems , social networks , food webs , etc .",
    ", to power grids , internet or the world wide web .",
    "while most of the initial effort was put into understanding the topological properties of networks , the interest has gradually shifted towards the analysis of the interplay between topology and the dynamics of network components . in general , each element ( node ) in a network undergoes a dynamical process while coupled to other nodes .",
    "the system collective behavior depends strongly on the efficiency of communication paths , which is in turn dictated by the underlying network topology . in this way",
    ", the network structure determines to a large extent the possibility of a coherent response .",
    "complete synchronization is the most prominent example of coherent behavior , and is a key phenomenon in systems of coupled oscillators as those characterizing most biological networks or physiological functions @xcite .",
    "for instance , synchronized neural firing has been suggested as specially relevant for neural signal transmission @xcite . from a more technological point of view , precision synchronization of computer clocks in local area networks and the internet is essential for optimal network performance .",
    "moreover , in an interesting twist , the dynamics toward synchronization has been recently used as a dynamical process unveiling the underlying community structure in complex networks @xcite .    here",
    "we study how synchronous behavior is affected by the network structure .",
    "the range of stability of a synchronized state is a measure of the system ability to yield a coherent response and to distribute information efficiently among its elements , while a loss of stability fosters pattern formation @xcite .",
    "here we answer the following question : _ which is the topology that maximizes the network synchronizability ? _ @xcite .",
    "we will construct such optimal topologies , for any fixed number of nodes and links , by employing an optimization procedure .",
    "the resulting structures , that we call _ entangled networks _ , are optimal not only for synchronizability , but also regarding other flow or connectivity properties .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the spectral approach to synchronization , following ref .",
    "@xcite . in section 3",
    "we introduce the optimization procedure to obtain networks with optimal synchronizability .",
    "section 4 discusses the relation between the emerging structures and other optimal network designs in the literature .",
    "finally , conclusions and further developments are presented .",
    "a shorter presentation of this work has been published before @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath0 identical oscillators at the nodes of an undirected and unweighted graph .",
    "the state of an oscillator is represented in general by a vector @xmath1 , @xmath2 $ ] , where @xmath0 is the number of nodes .",
    "the network is characterized by its laplacian matrix @xmath3 , with elements @xmath4 ( the degree of node @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 if nodes @xmath5 and @xmath7 are connected , and @xmath8 otherwise .",
    "@xmath3 is therefore a symmetric matrix with zero - sum rows and real , non - negative spectrum .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath5-th node can then be represented in a very general form as , @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are unspecified evolution and coupling functions , respectively",
    ". in particular , @xmath12 controls the dynamics of the uncoupled oscillators , while @xmath11 specifies how variables at different nodes couple together .",
    "most dynamical processes studied in the literature regarding synchronization can be recasted in forms equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ ecevol ] ) ( see @xcite for more general couplings ) . in the synchronized state",
    "all oscillators behave identically at all times .",
    "that is , @xmath13 @xmath14 $ ] , where @xmath15 is solution of the uncoupled equation @xmath16 ( @xmath17 represents the time derivative of @xmath18 ) .",
    "the @xmath19 synchronization constraints @xmath20 define a _",
    "synchronization manifold_. this manifold is invariant owing to the zero - sum row condition in the laplacian matrix @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "we are interested here in the stability of the synchronized state .",
    "for that , we introduce small perturbations @xmath21 such that @xmath22 , and expand to first order to arrive at : @xmath23 \\cdot { \\bf \\xi}_i$ ] , where @xmath24 stands for the jacobian of a matrix @xmath25 .",
    "diagonalization of * l * transforms these equations into a set of @xmath0 independent equations for the normal modes @xcite : @xmath26 \\cdot { \\bf y}_k \\quad , \\label{ecdiag}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 , @xmath28 $ ] , are the eigenvalues of @xmath3 , @xmath29 .",
    "all the resulting equations have the same form @xmath30 \\cdot { \\bf y}$ ] for some positive constant @xmath31 .",
    "the synchronized state @xmath32 will be stable if and only if all the perturbations fade away in time .",
    "this is equivalent to demanding the maximum lyapunov exponent @xmath33 associated with the normal modes orthogonal to the synchronization manifold to be negative .",
    "the function @xmath33 has been called the _ master stability function _ in literature @xcite , and its dependence on @xmath31 has an universal `` v - shape '' for most oscillating systems . in particular , @xmath33 is negative only in an interval @xmath34",
    ". the synchronized state will be stable if all the non - trivial eigenvalues of @xmath3 , @xmath35 , lie within the interval @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "the following inequality then guarantees that there always exists a coupling strength @xmath37 for which the synchronized state is stable , @xmath38 it is important to notice that the left hand side in the above inequality depends exclusively on the network topology , while the right hand side depends only on the dynamics ( through @xmath32 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .",
    "the @xmath37 range for which the synchronized state is stable , @xmath41 $ ] , is larger for smaller eigenratios @xmath42 . in this way",
    ", networks with very small @xmath42 will exhibit very good ( robust ) synchronization properties for a generic dynamics .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find and characterize network topologies minimizing the eigenratio @xmath42 .",
    "most studies up to now have explored the value of the eigenratio @xmath42 for different pre - existing network topologies found in literature , as for instance small - world or scale - free networks , trying to identify key topological features affecting @xmath42 . in this way",
    ", it has been reported that small - worlds have smaller @xmath42 than regular or purely random graphs @xcite , and this has been attributed to a smaller average distance between nodes in small - worlds . however , other works @xcite have concluded recently that @xmath42 decreases as some heterogeneity measures decrease , even if the average distance between nodes increases in the process . on the other hand ,",
    "synchronizability is enhanced in weighted complex networks @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we undertake a constructive approach to determine the network topology that optimizes synchronization . in order to do so ,",
    "we devise a modified simulated annealing algorithm @xcite to numerically minimize @xmath42 .",
    "we start from graphs with @xmath0 nodes and a fixed average degree @xmath43 . at each step , a new graph is obtained by the random deletion of @xmath44 links and addition of @xmath44 new ones , where @xmath44 is extracted from an exponentially decaying distribution @xcite .",
    "the new graph is rejected if the resulting network is disconnected ; otherwise , it is accepted with probability @xmath45^{1/(1-q)})$ ] , where @xmath46 is the eigenratio change in the rewiring , and @xmath47 is a temperature - like parameter .",
    "for @xmath48 we recover the standard metropolis algorithm with _ hamiltonian _",
    "@xmath42 , while @xmath49 turns out to be the most efficient value ( results do not depend on the choice of the deformation parameter @xmath50 , but convergence times do @xcite ) .",
    "the first @xmath0 rewirings are performed at @xmath51 , and they are used to calculate a new @xmath47 such that the largest @xmath52 among the first @xmath0 ones would be accepted with a large probability .",
    "@xmath47 is kept fixed for @xmath53 rewiring attempts or @xmath54 accepted ones , whichever occurs first .",
    "then @xmath47 is decreased by @xmath55 and the process is repeated until there are no more changes during five successive temperature steps , assuming in this case that the optimal network topology has been found . most of these details can be modified without affecting the final outcome .",
    "the major drawback in the algorithm is that @xmath42 is a global observable slow to compute . for small enough @xmath0 ( @xmath56 ) , the emerging optimal",
    "topology found is unique , while for larger @xmath0 ( we have optimized networks with @xmath0 up to @xmath57 ) the output may change slightly from run to run , meaning that the eigenratio absolute minimum is not always reached due to the presence of metastable states .",
    "nevertheless , the final values of @xmath42 are very similar for different runs ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , meaning that a reasonably good approximation to the optimal topology is always found @xcite .",
    "we measure different topological observables during the minimization process to unveil the main traits of the emerging structures . in simple terms",
    ", we observe that as @xmath42 decreases the network becomes more and more homogeneous .",
    "this means that the standard deviation of distributions of most topological observables decreases as @xmath42 decreases .",
    "this is true in particular for the node degree distribution , see fig .",
    "[ fig2].a .",
    "we have used this degree homogeneity to improve the efficiency our optimization procedure by initializing the algorithm with regular networks ( i.e. all nodes with the same degree ) , and restricting the rewiring steps to changes that leave the degree of each node unchanged ( by randomly selecting _ pairs _ of links and exchanging their endpoints ; see fig . [",
    "fig2].b ) .",
    "the resulting algorithm converges much faster to the optimal network , and yields lower final eigenratios @xmath42 when the original one get trapped in a metastable state ( fig  [ fig2].c ) .    in figs .",
    "[ fig3].a - b we show the standard deviation of the average node - to - node distance and average betweenness , respectively , versus @xmath42 during an optimization run started from a random regular graph .",
    "both observables exhibit the aforementioned tendency towards homogeneity .",
    "particularly remarkable is the narrow betweenness distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig3].b ) , which is in marked contrast with the broad betweenness distributions observed in networks with strong community structure @xcite .",
    "in addition , the averaged distance and betweenness also tend to decrease with @xmath42 , though they are less sensitive than their corresponding standard deviations , see figs .",
    "[ fig3].c - d .",
    "another key feature of the optimal structures is the absence of short loops .",
    "this can be characterized by the _ girth _ ( length of the shortest loop ) or , better , via the average size of the shortest loop passing through each node .",
    "this last magnitude is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3].e , where it is evident that the optimal network has very large average shortest loops . in particular , the clustering coefficient is zero for the optimal nets since no triangles are present .    in general , we call the emerging optimal structures _ entangled networks _ : all sites are very much alike ( strong homogeneity ) and the links form a very intricated or interwoven structure ( lack of communities , poor modularity , and large shortest loops ) .",
    "every single site is close to any other one ( short average distances ) owing not to the existence of intermediate highly connected hubs ( as in scale free networks ) , but as a result of a very `` democratic '' or entangled structure in which properties such as site - to - site distance , betweenness , and minimum - loop size are very homogeneously distributed ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1].b , [ fig3].a - b ) .",
    "sharp distributions are also typical of random graph , where randomness alone produces a statistical homogeneity .",
    "however in this case , a much stronger homogeneity is produced during the optimization of @xmath42 , as figures  [ fig3].a - b show .",
    "a natural question concerns the relation between entangled networks and other optimal architectures found in the literature .",
    "for instance , recent work @xcite has focused on the optimization of network robustness against random and/or intentional removal of nodes ( attacks ) . for random graphs in the large-@xmath0 limit",
    ", it is concluded that the most robust networks are obtained when the degree distribution only has a few peaks . in particular , random @xmath58-regular graphs turn out to be the global optimal solution against both errors and attacks in the robustness - optimization problem @xcite . in this case , the error ( @xmath59 ) and attack ( @xmath60 ) percolation thresholds coincide , @xmath61 , with @xmath62 .",
    "a natural question now is whether further @xmath63minimization of these random regular graphs has some effect on the network robustness .",
    "as shown in @xcite the minimization of @xmath42 improves significantly the network robustness , confirming that entangled networks are optimal from the robustness point of view .",
    "this is because entangled topologies include correlations , absent in random networks , which enhance their resilience .",
    "in addition , there is also evidence that networks with properties similar to those of entangled graphs maximize reliability against link removal @xcite .",
    "different models of traffic flows on complex network have been recently studied @xcite . in principle",
    "highly inhomogeneous scale - free networks perform well when the traffic is low ; hubs can provide fast transition times , while they easily jam when the traffic increases . with the model of @xcite",
    "it has been shown that if the density of traveling information packets is above a given threshold , the optimal network topology is a highly homogeneous , isotropic configuration , strongly resembling entangled graphs . in a similar way",
    ", it has been recently reported @xcite that the interplay between network growth processes and evolutionary selection rules gives rise in some cases to very homogeneous structures with large minimal - loops that strongly resemble entangled networks ( see fig .",
    "3.c in @xcite ) .    also , during our optimization procedure",
    ", @xmath64 is observed to change very little with respect to @xmath65 , and therefore , minimizing @xmath42 is equivalent for all practical purposes to maximizing @xmath65 .",
    "this provides another interesting connection with graph theory , where it is known that regular graphs with a large @xmath65 ( i.e._large spectral gap _ ) , are good _ expanders _ ( see @xcite for a definition and applications ) .",
    "expander graphs are very important in computer science for various applications ( as the design of efficient communication networks or construction of error - correcting codes ) and can be proved to exhibit a rapid decay of random - walk distributions towards their stationary state @xcite .",
    "this converts entangled graphs in ( almost ) optimal for many information flow processes .",
    "we have introduced the concept of `` entangled networks '' @xcite .",
    "these are constructed using an optimization principle by imposing the eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix to have a quotient @xmath66 as small as possible , guaranteeing in this way a robust synchronizability and coherent behavior .",
    "the emerging topologies are extremely homogeneous : all nodes look very much alike ( constituting a topology radically distinct from scale free networks ) . also , the node - to - node average distance tends to be small while the average shortest loops are very large , and there is no modular ( or community ) structure .",
    "entangled networks exhibit optimal synchronization properties , but they are also optimal or almost - optimal for other communication or flow properties : robustness and resilience against errors and attacks , traffic flow in the presence of congestion , relaxation properties of random walks , etc .",
    "these connections make of entangled networks a key tool in the context of complex networks .",
    "an interesting issue concerns the existence of entangled networks in nature .",
    "their construction requires a global optimization process which is unlikely to occur in natural evolving systems .",
    "presently , we are working on the identification of local evolutionary rules which give rise to locally - optimal synchronizable network patterns , or other feasible approximations to entangled networks .",
