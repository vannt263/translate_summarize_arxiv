    "the expected melting of the spherical crystal at high level of noise provides a qualitative criterion to check the reliability of our simulations .",
    "figure  [ melting ] shows the typical snapshots of the spherical crystal with the increase of the noise strength @xmath50 .",
    "simulations capture the splitting of quadrupoles into isolated dislocations [ see fig .",
    "[ melting](b ) ] and their further fission into isolated 5- and 7-fold disclinations [ from fig .",
    "[ melting](c ) ] .",
    "therefore , the simulated spherical crystal system experiences the intermediate hexatic phase characterized by the proliferation of dislocations in the noise driven crystal - to - liquid phase transition .",
    "this hexatic phase has been predicted by the kthny theory for the melting of infinitely large two - dimensional planar crystals .",
    "@xcite note that md simulations of two - dimensional melting on sphere with a repulsive @xmath63 potential also return results that are consistent with the kthny theory .",
    "@xcite in our system , the parameter @xmath50 that controls the step size in the random motion of the particles plays a similar role of temperature in the kthny theory .",
    "the appearance sequence of quadrupoles , dislocations , and disclinations with the increase of @xmath50 is also observed in smaller spherical crystals . in the spherical crystal of 252 particles , isolated dislocations and disclinations",
    "appear at @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "@xmath66 is the critical melting condition from crystal to hexatic phase , and @xmath67 is that from hexatic to liquid phase .",
    "both these critical values for @xmath50 are smaller than those in the larger system of 1002 particles .",
    "the size - dependence of the critical melting conditions is related to the compactness of the spherical crystal . by confining more mutually repulsive particles in a compact surface without a boundary like a sphere or a torus ,",
    "the system becomes stiffer .",
    "specifically , for @xmath7 electrically charged particles with the @xmath68-coulomb potential confined on sphere , the energy of the system increases with @xmath7 in the form of @xmath69 .",
    "@xcite it leads to an enhanced young s modulus of the elastic medium composed of the equilibrium hexagonal lattice .",
    "the binding energy of a dislocation pair and a disclination pair is proportional to the young s modulus .",
    "@xcite consequently , the binding energy of the defect clusters like quadrupoles and dislocations is elevated with the increase of the number of particles .",
    "we therefore require a larger @xmath50 to activate the proliferation of isolated dislocations and disclinations to realize the respective phase transitions .",
    "now we tune the noise @xmath50 to a low level below the melting point in order to highlight the dynamic features of an active particle .",
    "we introduce an active particle in the spherical crystal by imposing a random active force @xmath70 in eq.([langevin_dimensionless ] ) , and study its dynamics and interplay with the pre - existent disclinations . with the increase of the magnitude of the active force , we observe that the active particle finally escapes from the initially trapped state and gains mobility when @xmath70 exceeds some critical value @xmath71 .",
    "the value for @xmath71 is unaffected by the noise strength @xmath50 . for a spherical crystal of @xmath72 particles , @xmath73 for @xmath50 ranging from @xmath74 to @xmath75 . for an arbitrarily chosen trapped active particle at low @xmath50 , whether it is a disclination or not , increasing the noise strength only induces a localized slight distortion of the crystal lattice near the trapped active particle ; the maximum amount of the movement of the active particle does not exceed even one lattice spacing over up to a million time steps .",
    "therefore , it is the active force instead of the noise that provides the drive force to propel a particle .    figures  [ act_pt](a)-[act_pt](d ) show the interaction of the active particle ( the large purple dot ) initially near an isolated 5-fold disclination ( the large green dot ) [ see fig .",
    "[ act_pt](a ) ] .",
    "we numerically observe that the active particle induces topological charges when it approaches the isolated disclination , creating a defect cluster with total topological charge @xmath76 [ see fig .",
    "[ act_pt](b ) ] .",
    "this phenomenon can be understood in the following way . according to the elasticity theory of topological defects , disclinations of the same sign",
    "repel and unlike signs attract .",
    "a pair of positive and negative disclinations constitute a dislocation which is analogous to an electric dipole .",
    "an isolated disclination can induce the formation of dislocations around it .",
    "the total topological charge in this process must be invariant as a topological constraint .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , it costs energy to create defects in crystal . around an isolated disclination , when the reduction of the energy due to the attraction of the disclination and dislocation(s ) exceeds the energy required to create dislocation(s ) , the isolated disclination becomes a cluster of defects .",
    "the transformation of an isolated disclination into a linear defect structure called scar has been experimentally observed in spherical crystal with the increase of the sphere radius .",
    "@xcite a scar is a defect string of alternating 5-fold and 7-fold disclinations , but with one more 5-fold disclination .",
    "here , we observe that an active particle can induce such a transformation without any change of the sphere size .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ act_pt](c ) and ( d ) , the random active force later pulls the active particle away from the defect cluster . when the active particle moves in the crystalline zone among the isolated disclinations , the distorted crystalline lattice behind it is healed .",
    "while few neutral quadrupoles appear in the smaller system of @xmath77 , the trajectory of a moving particle in the larger system of @xmath78 is free of defects .",
    "this can be attributed to the larger young s modulus in larger systems , which elevates the energy barrier for the formation of defects .",
    "@xcite no isolated dislocations in the trajectory of a moving particle are observed ; more energy is required to create a dislocation than a quadrupole according to the elasticity theory of topological defects .",
    "@xcite    the restoration of the distorted crystal lattice in the trajectory behind the motion of an active particle can be attributed to the long - range repulsive interaction potential between particles .",
    "the extra free space created by a moving particle is filled up by surrounding particles under the long - range repulsive force . in order to confirm that a defect - free trajectory does not rely on the specific form of the long - range force",
    ", we perform further simulations using another long - range force in the form of @xmath79 .",
    "it turns out that such a force can also support defect - free trajectories .",
    "in contrast , in the two - dimensional lennard - jones ( l - j ) crystal , where particles interact via the l - j potential , the emergent stable vacancies may impede the complete healing of the trajectory of a moving particle .",
    "@xcite simulations show that when we remove the attractive part in the l - j potential , the repulsive potential in the form of @xmath80 decays so fast that it can not support the initially prepared crystalline order on sphere with the proliferation of defects .    to further exclude the possible influence of the dynamics of the active force on the healing of the crystalline order in the trajectory of a moving particle",
    ", we simulate cases where the reorientation of @xmath23 ( the direction of the active force ) is subject to a finite noise instead of being completely random .",
    "specifically , @xmath23 rotates by angle @xmath25 in each time step , which conforms to the gaussian distribution with mean zero and variance @xmath26 . for both cases of @xmath81 and @xmath82",
    ", we numerically observe the restoration of the distorted lattice in the trajectory of the active particle ; defects are accumulated around the moving particle .",
    "it is of interest to note that the aggregation phenomenon of defects is also observed in our recently studied size - polydispersity driven distortion of crystal lattice .",
    "@xcite it is found that an impurity particle of a wrong size in a perfect crystal induces localized defect patterns to screen the effect of the impurity particle .",
    "figure  [ act_pt](d ) shows that the crystalline order very near the active particle ( in the region of a few lattice spacings ) is disrupted .",
    "the active particle carries a topologically neutral defect cluster when it moves around without any contact with the pre - existent disclinations .",
    "it is essentially through this defect cluster that an active particle interacts with the isolated disclinations .",
    "simulations show that an active particle also carries a neutral defect cluster when moving in the lattice sufficiently away from any of the isolated disclinations .",
    "therefore , the surrounding defect cluster dressing the active particle is not caused by contact with a disclination .",
    "such a companion defect structure reflects the intrinsic local lattice distortion near the active particle .",
    "this basic scenario of dressed active particle with surrounding topological defects is also observed in systems where the active particle is initially also an isolated disclination .    moving an isolated disclination in crystalline order",
    "requires a global transformation of the crystal lattice due to the topological property of the disclination .",
    "@xcite take an n - fold disclination in two - dimensional hexagonal crystal for example , it can be created by removing ( for @xmath83 ) or adding ( for @xmath84 ) a @xmath85 wedge .",
    "@xcite therefore , unlike dislocations that can freely glide across a crystalline medium , the motion of isolated disclinations is usually realized through interactions with other defects or by evolving into a scar to extend itself in space .",
    "@xcite it is of interest to endow an isolated disclination with activity and to observe the dynamics of the active disclination . for its dual role as an active particle and also as a disclination , here such a particle",
    "is named a disclinational active particle .",
    "we impose sufficiently large active forces on the 12 isolated disclinations to mobilize them [ see fig .",
    "[ act_pt](e ) ] .",
    "we observe the proliferation of topological defects around the active particle and the ultimate split of the defect cluster into a scar [ the 5 - 7 - 5 configuration in the left of the blue box in fig .",

    "the resulting free - standing topologically charged scar [ see fig .",
    "[ act_pt](f ) ] from the split of the defect cluster inherits the topological charge from the original disclinational active particle .",
    "both theoretical and experimental studies on the ground state of spherical crystals show that when @xmath86 exceeds about 5 , an isolated disclination becomes a scar to lower the energy .",
    "@xcite for the system in fig .",
    "[ act_pt ] with @xmath78 , @xmath87 , which exceeds the critical value for the appearance of scars .",
    "isolated disclinations are therefore metastable . once touched by a dressed active particle , a disclination becomes a scar as shown in fig .",
    "[ act_pt](d ) and [ act_pt](f ) .",
    "this observation shows that active particles can facilitate the system to conquer the energy barrier to reach a new low - energy state . in this process ,",
    "the source of the required energy is from the energy input through the active particle .",
    "once formed , a scar is observed to be anchored in the spherical crystal .",
    "the arrows in fig .",
    "[ act_pt](h ) indicate the locations of the scars or topologically charged defect clusters , all of which are close to the original sites of the isolated disclinations in fig .",
    "[ act_pt](e ) .",
    "therefore , the migration of the active particle , whether it is initially an disclination or not , can only take away a topologically neutral defect cluster .",
    "the net topological charge remains in its initial position .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon can be traced down to the topological property of the disclination that requires a global transformation of the crystal lattice to change its position .",
    "the conversion of regularly distributed isolated disclinations into scars of distinct orientations lowers the symmetry of the system .",
    "numerical observation of moving particles in the resulting scarred spherical crystal indicates that the basic physical picture of dressed active particle does not rely on the specific position and orientation of the pre - existent defects .",
    "it can be attributed to the fact that these defects influence the state of an active particle only when they are as close as few lattice spacings .",
    "the defect pattern around the active particle is unaffected by pre - existent defects a few lattice spacings away .",
    "consequently , the scenario of dressed active particle is also expected in the less symmetric lattices with nonzero @xmath14 or @xmath88 in comparison with those of @xmath12 ; these less symmetric lattices essentially change the relative orientations and positions of the disclinations .      in the preceding discussions ,",
    "we have established that an active particle , whether it is a disclination or not , always carries a collection of defects in its random motion .",

    ", we also observe that it leaves a net topological charge of @xmath76 in its original site in the form of a @xmath113 scar [ see the defect in the right smaller box in fig .",
    "[ ballistic](c ) ] just like for a randomly moving disclinational active particle .",
    "the defect pattern around the active particle in its ballistic motion also oscillates between the state 0 [ where the defects are arranged in the form of 7 - 4 - 7 as in the large purple dot in the large box in fig .",
    "[ ballistic](c ) ] and state 1 ( 7-(5 - 5)-7 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ ballistic](c ) and  [ ballistic](d ) , respectively .",
    "we vary the speed of the active particle by adjusting the value for @xmath70 from @xmath114 to @xmath115 .",
    "the basic physical picture of dressed active particle and the oscillation between the two states remains over such a broad spectrum for the particle speed .",
    "it is of interest to note that periodic oscillation of defects has been experimentally observed in spherical active nematics , arising from the collective motion of all the active microtubules composing the liquid crystal vesicle .",
    "@xcite the conformations of the defects are preserved in this process .",
    "in contrast , in our spherical crystal system the defect structures are excited by an arbitrarily chosen individual particle .",
    "and we observe featured phenomena that are absent in the collective motion in spherical active nematics , including the healing of the defects in the trajectory of the active particle , the scenario of dressed active particle , and the random two - state oscillation of the surrounding defect pattern .    in our system of electrically charged particles confined on sphere ,",
    "the emergent defect structures are induced by the motion of a self - propelled active particle in the crystalline order .",
    "similar phenomena also occur in other physical and biological systems , where the motion of an object in an ordered medium can excite emergent structures therein .",
    "the specific form of the resulting structures reflects the nature of the ordered medium .",
    "for example , a sufficiently fast moving cylinder in fluid can excite the formation of vortices .",
    "@xcite in crystalline materials , fast moving defects can create new defect structures .",
    "@xcite a recent study on the collective migration of deformable biological cells shows that individual eukaryotic cells caged in the hexagonal arrangement of cells can deform themselves and exhibit a wiggling motion to escape from the cells cluster . in this process",
    ", cells compete for the emergent structure of voids which are formed in the deformation of cells .",
    "in summary , simulations show that a moving active particle in spherical crystal is surrounded by localized topological defects , becoming a dressed active particle . as a consequence of the long - range repulsion between particles ,",
    "the trajectory of the active particle is free of defects .",
    "we further observe the random oscillation of a ballistic active particle between two defect states .",
    "the nonequilibrium behaviors of spherical crystal excited by a moving active particle involve dynamics of all the particles .",
    "we demonstrate that focusing on the structure of topological defects significantly reduces the degree of freedom of the system , and the physical picture of dressed active particle emerges .",
