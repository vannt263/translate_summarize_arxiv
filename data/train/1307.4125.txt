    "advances in the formation of cold molecules have opened up avenues into many branches of the physical sciences @xcite . for chemical physics ,",
    "applications range from precision spectroscopy @xcite , to the study @xcite and control @xcite of cold chemical reactions .",
    "other areas of physics benefit greatly from the study of cold molecules , such as condensed matter physics @xcite , and the search for novel quantum gases @xcite and phases @xcite .",
    "oxides such as pbo @xcite , yo @xcite and tio @xcite have been of interest recently for electron dipole moment measurements , direct cooling and trapping of molecules respectively , as has the oh radical @xcite .",
    "molecular ions have the advantage of being easily trapped and cooled using radio frequency traps and sympathetic cooling @xcite while not involving an oxide radical .",
    "recent progress on the oxide ion front has seen the co - trapping @xcite of cold rubidium and hydroxide . in this work",
    "we investigate the interactions of rb+oh , and find that it is possible to control the associative dissociation process of forming neutral rubidium hydroxyl by accessable laser controlled transitions .",
    "electronic structure calculations were performed on rbh , rbo , oh , rboh and associated anions using a combination of perturbation and coupled cluster theory @xcite .",
    "second order mller - plesset ( mp2 ) perturbation theory and coupled cluster theory with all singles , doubles , and perturbative triples ( ccsd(t ) ) energy and gradient calculations in this work were carried out using the cfour @xcite and molpro 2010.1 @xcite quantum chemistry packages .",
    "higher order calculations involving ccsdt and ccsdt(q ) ( all triples and perturbative quadruples respectively ) were done using the mrcc program of m. kllay @xcite . for open shell systems ,",
    "the spin restricted variants of these theories were used . due to the size of rubidium",

    "valence only calculations ( h:1s ; o:2s2p ; rb:5s ) are referred to as relaxed valence ( rv ) .",
    "increasing the correlation space size to involve the first set of sub - valence orbitals ( h:1s ; o:1s2s2p ; rb:4s4p5s ) results in the relaxed inner - valence ( riv ) , while spaces including yet deeper orbitals ( h:1s ; o:1s2s2p ; rb:3s3p3d4s4p5s ) are called riiv and so forth .",
    "valence ( rv ) only calculations involving rubidium and oxygen require extra care , as the usual method of energy sorting orbitals in selecting the frozen core will fail since the energy of @xmath7 orbital of oxygen is below the @xmath8 orbital of rubidium . failing to properly choose the core orbitals for valence calculations will lead to significant errors .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     as these collisions involve rotationally and vibrationally excited states of a polar molecule , it is important to characterize the lifetime of these states in the absence of collisions . to do this",
    "we have computed the oh@xmath0 potential energy curve near the equilibrium geometry at the @xmath10(ccsd(t)/riv ) level of theory as well as the static dipole moment @xmath11 along this curve at the ccsd(t)/rv level of theory using the aug - cc - pvqz basis set .",

    "we have computed ccsd(t ) _ ab initio _ potential energy curves for the rb+oh and rb+oh@xmath0 systems , and found a neutral - ion curve crossing along the inner wall of the potential energy curve for collinear geometries of rboh .",
    "further investigation of the potential energy surface shows that this crossing is highly dependent on collisional angle and is accessible to reasonable scattering energies only for angles near the collinear geometry .",
    "furthermore , this crossing lies above the oh@xmath0 @xmath23 collisional threshold , and so is expected to have a negligible contribution to the long - term co - trapping of rubidium and hydroxide . using the langevin capture cross - section , we evaluate the associative detachment rate for the first few vibrationally excited states of hydroxide colliding with rubidium and find an appreciable rate coefficient @xmath24 @xmath3s@xmath4 for hydroxide vibrational levels @xmath1 .",
    "lifetimes for these vibrationally excited hydroxide molecules are computed , and found to be on the order of @xmath25 ms . with transitions between @xmath5 and @xmath1 ( see fig .",
