    "the search for the neutrino mixing angle @xmath11 has led to a number of proposals for reactor neutrino experiments , where anti - neutrinos are registered in liquid scintillator detectors by the inverse @xmath12 decay @xmath13 in this reaction the neutron is scattered preferentially in the forward direction so that it retains some memory of the neutrino s initial direction , an effect first observed in experiments at the gsgen reactor complex  @xcite . by reconstructing the vertices of the positron and neutron absorptions , one obtains an image of the neutrino source .",
    "the chooz experiment demonstrated the feasibility of this approach in that 2,500 events were enough to locate the source within a @xmath2 half - cone aperture of @xmath14  @xcite . in principle",
    ", this method also allows one to determine the location of a galactic supernova explosion  @xcite and the distribution of anti - neutrinos emitted by the natural radioactive elements in the earth  @xcite , although in practice these applications are severely limited by the relatively small number of events .",
    "here we investigate the potential of future reactor experiments to exploit the same effect , but with much larger statistics .",
    "in particular , the upcoming double chooz experiment  @xcite will be a first important test of the principles of directional measurements , which will explore the requirements for future large volume detectors .",
    "double chooz will operate two nearly identical detectors at distances of roughly 280  m and 1,050  m , respectively .",
    "the near detector will register @xmath1 events per year , vastly exceeding the exposure of the chooz experiment that was located at the far site of double chooz and had only a short data - taking period .",
    "thus one year of double chooz data correspond to 64 times the chooz exposure and hence to an 8-fold improved angular resolution , implying that the neutrino source can be located within a @xmath2 half - cone aperture of  @xmath3 .",
    "the chooz nuclear power plant consists of two reactors that are viewed by the near detector at an angular separation @xmath4 so that one may well wonder if it is possible to separate the `` neutrino images '' of the two sources and/or to monitor their individual neutrino and thus power output . in spite of the impressive single - source directional sensitivity ,",
    "this is not entirely obvious or trivial . even though the average neutrino direction can be determined very well , separating two very blurred neutrino images is not simple even with the large event rate at the double chooz near detector .    in sec .",

    "experimentally , the chooz experiment found @xmath20  cm  @xcite . to be specific",
    "we will use @xmath21 representing an average over the incoming neutrino energies and the outgoing neutron directions .",
    "the large spatial distribution of the neutron absorption points as well as the even larger uncertainty of the neutron and positron event reconstruction imply that indeed only the average of the neutron displacement matters here .    the experimental output used for the directional information is a set of reconstructed displacement vectors @xmath22 between the positron - annihilation and neutron - capture events , where @xmath23 . in the double chooz near detector we have in one year @xmath24 events , originating from both reactor cores together . unless otherwise stated we will always use this event number in our numerical estimates .",
    "our main simplifying assumption is that for a single neutrino source the distribution of the displacement vectors is a gaussian with equal width @xmath25 in each direction . in the first chooz paper addressing the neutrino imaging of a reactor  @xcite , an rms uncertainty for the neutron event reconstruction of 1717.5  cm was given in their fig .",
    "2 . their fig .  3 implies @xmath2620  cm and thus a positron event reconstruction uncertainty of 810  cm , in agreement with a similar result of the borexino collaboration  @xcite . in a later chooz publication  @xcite ,",
    "the rms uncertainty for the neutron event reconstruction was given as 19  cm .",
    "assuming 9  cm for the average positron reconstruction uncertainty leads to @xmath27 that we will use as our benchmark value . with the planned photomultiplier coverage in double chooz",
    "one does not expect to improve on this value  @xcite so that the chooz characteristics provide a realistic estimate .    given a gaussian distribution of width @xmath25 , its center of gravity",
    "can be determined with a @xmath2 precision @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 uncertainty for the angular location of a single source is @xmath29 that applies separately to the azimuthal and zenith angle .",
    "one year s data provide an angular uncertainty of @xmath30 .",

    "assuming that the detector response is spherically symmetric , one can extract @xmath25 from the @xmath19-distribution @xmath45 of the displacement vectors .",
    "this distribution is equivalent to that from a single source .",
    "the distribution of @xmath25 for many realizations , each with @xmath46 , is essentially gaussian  with @xmath47 one year s data provide @xmath25 with a fractional precision of @xmath48 so that its uncertainty is negligible for our further discussion . in addition , one could test deviations from the assumed gaussianity of the distribution .",
    "the average neutron forward displacement @xmath49 can be extracted from the @xmath18-distribution of the displacement vectors . assuming a symmetric setup with @xmath50 , @xmath51 factorizes as @xmath52 and @xmath53 is independent of the relative reactor strengths .",

    "after one year the @xmath2 uncertainty will be @xmath59 .",
    "scaled to 2,500 events , this forecast corresponds reasonably well to the @xmath49 uncertainty of @xmath60 found by chooz .      as a first nontrivial application we address the question of",
    "how well one can monitor the relative reactor strengths . with @xmath50 ,",

    "the @xmath2 uncertainty of each individual reactor strength is @xmath71 , whereas the uncertainty of their sum is only @xmath72 .",
    "we have seen that for the double chooz setup , the directional sensitivity of the near detector allows one to determine the integrated source strength of the two reactors separately , even though the uncertainty remains relatively large for one year of data .",
    "we now ask the opposite question if one can separate the `` neutrino images '' of the two reactor cores , assuming their relative strength is known , and assuming the detector characteristics @xmath25 and @xmath49 have been established by other means precisely enough that their uncertainty does not matter in the following .",
    "we primarily discuss how well the separation angle @xmath42 can be determined , assuming we know that there are exactly two sources in the @xmath17-@xmath18-plane that produce equal numbers of events .",
    "the obvious observables are the central coordinates @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 of the displacement vector distribution and their variances .",
    "at first one may think that the width of the observed distribution @xmath51 is broadened in the @xmath17-direction if one has two sources because this distribution is a superposition of two gaussian distributions of width @xmath25 that are displaced relative to each other by the distance @xmath76 where we have assumed @xmath50 .",
    "however , one easily finds in this case @xmath77 the rms width of the @xmath17-distribution increases only quadratically in a small quantity with respect to the width @xmath25 of a single source . for our parameters ,",
    "the rms width of the double gauss function is the same as that of a single gaussian within @xmath78 and thus indistinguishable , even with five year s data of almost a million events .",
    "analogous conclusions pertain to the higher moments of a single gaussian compared to a double gauss function when their separation is much smaller than their width . in other words , with the foreseen statistics of the double chooz near detector , the neutrino images of the two reactors are far too blurred to be separated .    however , it is still possible to distinguish a single source from two sources if one takes advantage of the information encoded in the average coordinates of the displacement vector distribution . in the symmetric setup assumed here ,",
    "information about the separation angle is provided by the distribution @xmath79 that we have already used in sec .",
    "[ sec : displacement ] to determine @xmath49 if the separation angle is known . turning this argument around",
    "we may instead solve for @xmath80 .",
    "its uncertainty  is @xmath81 which is @xmath82 for our usual parameters and one year s data .",
    "if the separation angle is large , it can be ascertained with fairly good accuracy . on the other hand , for the double chooz geometry with @xmath58 ,",
    "the reactors could be barely separated on this basis , even with five year s data . moreover , since the angular separation relies on a measurement of the quantity @xmath83 , an independent precise determination of @xmath49 is necessary .    in a certain number of cases the value for",
    "@xmath80 implied by the data will exceed unity and will thus be unphysical .",
    "in other words , in these cases one can not distinguish a single source from two sources . since @xmath80 follows a gaussian distribution and using the width eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmacosbeta ] ) , this will be the case with the `` confusion probability '' @xmath84\\,.\\ ] ] for our usual parameters and one year s data we have @xmath85 .",
    "after five years this number reduces to 0.29% . turning this around , in more than 99.7% of all cases",
    "the data will imply the presence of two sources .",
    "therefore , we estimate that the double chooz near detector takes five years to distinguish the two reactors from a single source with a @xmath6 confidence .",
    "the reason for this relatively poor performance is that even for a separation angle as large as @xmath4 , the relevant quantity @xmath86 is difficult to distinguish from 1 for the given statistics . on the other hand ,",
    "if the separation angle is somewhat larger , the deviation of @xmath87 from 1 itself quickly becomes of order unity so that @xmath87 can be easily distinguished from  1 .",
    "assuming the same detector characteristics and @xmath7 , we estimate that one could measure @xmath88 with a precision of a few degrees even after only one year .    on the other hand , determining the central angle @xmath89 becomes more difficult if the separation angle is too large . for two equally strong reactors on opposite sides of the detector ( @xmath90 )",
    ", the separation angle can be very well measured , whereas @xmath89 would remain completely undetermined .",
    "one would conclude that there are two reactors at opposite sides without any information on their absolute direction .",
    "the analytic estimates of the previous section are based on simple properties of the displacement - vectors distribution , notably the coordinates of its center of gravity . moreover",
    ", we have argued that the shape of the double - gauss distribution eq .",
    "( [ eq : distribution ] ) is very similar to that of a single gaussian .",
    "therefore , even for a five year exposure at the double chooz near detector , the shape of the displacement - vector distribution holds little additional information . still , the maximum information can be extracted by performing a maximum - likelihood analysis , i.e. , by fitting the measured distribution of displacement vectors to a function of the form eq .",

    "<S> in scintillator detectors , the forward displacement of the neutron in the reaction @xmath0 provides neutrino directional information as demonstrated by the chooz reactor experiment with 2,500 events . the near detector of the forthcoming double chooz experiment will collect @xmath1 events per year , enough to determine the average neutrino direction with a @xmath2 half - cone aperture of @xmath3 in one year . </S>",
    "<S> it is more difficult to separate the two chooz reactors that are viewed at a separation angle @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> if their strengths are known and approximately equal , the azimuthal location of each reactor is obtained with @xmath5 ( @xmath2 ) and the probability of confusing them with a single source is less than 11% . </S>",
    "<S> five year s data reduce this `` confusion probability '' to less than 0.3% , i.e. , a @xmath6 separation is possible . </S>",
    "<S> all of these numbers improve rapidly with increasing angular separation of the sources . </S>",
    "<S> for a setup with @xmath7 and one year s data , the azimuthal @xmath2 uncertainty for each source decreases to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> of course , for double chooz the two reactor locations are known , allowing one instead to measure their individual one - year integrated power output to @xmath9 ( @xmath2 ) , and their five - year integrated output to @xmath10  ( @xmath2 ) . </S>"
