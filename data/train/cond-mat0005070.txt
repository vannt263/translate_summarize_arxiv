    "without a magnetic field and disorder , the electronic properties of nanotubes are known to be dependent on their chiral vector @xmath9 , expressed in unit - vectors of the hexagonal lattice by @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) . from a tight - binding description of the graphite @xmath12 bands , with only first - neighbor c - c interactions ,",
    "the dispersion relations can be obtained by diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( with periodic boundary conditions ) , and for instance for the case of armchair @xmath13 nanotubes , we can write@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the energy overlap integral between carbon atoms , @xmath16 , is the graphite lattice constant , and @xmath17 is the wavevector perpendicular to the nanotube axis @xmath18 where @xmath19 , giving the quantized values of the wavevector in the @xmath20 direction , whereas the wavevector @xmath21 parallel to the nanotube axis is associated with the specification of the 1d brillouin zone @xmath22 which defines the 1d - band dispersion . by developing dispersion relations around the @xmath23-points ( i.e. , close to the fermi energy ) , with small @xmath24 ( with @xmath25 and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the smallest translation vector along the tube axis ) , one finds@xcite @xmath28 where the integer @xmath29 is related to @xmath30 and @xmath31 by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "two bands may then cross at the fermi level according to the value of @xmath29 . if @xmath35 ( i.e. , @xmath36 ) , one gets @xmath37 which defines the gap at the fermi energy of a semiconducting nanotube . for @xmath38 (",
    "i.e. , @xmath39 ) , the system is metallic ( in the sense @xmath40 ) .",
    "typically , the gap energy @xmath41 is , respectively , in the range @xmath42ev for nanotube diameters @xmath43 in the range @xmath44 nm .",
    "predicted theoretically,@xcite these results have been confirmed experimentally by scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( stm ) measurements.@xcite",
    "to investigate aharonov ",
    "bohm phenomena , we start from the hamiltonian @xmath45 for electrons moving on a nanotube under the influence of a magnetic field @xcite : @xmath46 where the phase factors are given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the localized atomic orbital , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 are , respectively , the momentum and disorder operators . as shown hereafter , different physics is found according to the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the nanotube axis . in the former case ,",
    "the vector potential is simply expressed as @xmath51 in the two - dimensional @xmath52 , @xmath53 coordinate system , and the phase factors become @xmath54 for @xmath55 .",
    "this yields new magnetic field - dependent dispersion relations @xmath56 .",
    "close to the fermi energy , this energy dispersion relation is affected according to @xmath57 which leads to a @xmath7-periodic variation@xcite of the energy gap @xmath41 .",
    "such patterns are reported in fig.1 ( top ) where the total density of states ( tdos ) at the fermi level is plotted as a function of magnetic field strength @xmath58 threading the nanotube for the metallic ( 9,0 ) and the semiconducting ( 10,0 ) nanotubes .",
    "note that a finite dos is found in fig.1 , for semiconducting and metallic nanotubes as a function of magnetic field , since we consider that the green s function has a finite imaginary part , that we use to calculate the dos by a recursion method @xcite .    in the semiconducting case",
    ", the oscillations in the dos correspond to the following variations of the gap widths @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is a characteristic energy associated with the nanotube .",
    "it turns out that at @xmath61 values of @xmath8 and @xmath62 , in accordance with the values of @xmath63 , there is a local gap - closing in the vicinity of either the @xmath64 or @xmath65 points in the brillouin zone .",
    "this can be seen simply by considering the coefficients of the general wavefunction in the vicinity of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 points , which can be written as @xmath66 .",
    "since periodic boundary conditions apply in the @xmath67 direction , one can write @xmath68 = 1 $ ] . for @xmath69 , we write @xmath70 whereas @xmath71 . when @xmath72 , then @xmath73 in the above expressions , as @xmath29 goes from @xmath74 , which makes the situation between @xmath64 and @xmath65 symmetrical .",
    "similarly for metallic nanotubes , the gap - width @xmath75 is expressed by @xmath76 here we show that the magnetic field also affects the positions of the vhss over the entire spectrum , which may be experimentally observed . as an illustration , the tdos for a ( 10,10 ) tube without a magnetic field , shown as curve ( a ) in fig.2 , is compared to the magnetic field case with @xmath77 and @xmath2 [ shown in fig.2 as curves ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) , respectively ] for energies up to @xmath78ev in which we have taken @xmath79ev , which is suitable for comparison with experiments.@xcite to understand such effects , one calculates the tdos from @xmath80=\\frac{2}{2\\pi } \\sum_{n } \\int dk \\delta(e-\\varepsilon_{nk } ) ,     \\label{eqn5c}\\ ] ] where the sum is taken over the @xmath31 energy bands @xmath81 and we use @xmath82 where @xmath83 indicates the position ( energy ) of the vhss . we can rewrite the dos as @xmath84 where @xmath85 for @xmath86 and zero otherwise.@xcite    the @xmath83 denote the energy - positions of the vhss , and for armchair nanotubes @xmath13 , one finds that @xmath87 and @xmath88 define the whole set of vhss ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the magnetic field induces a shift of @xmath90 by a factor @xmath91 , which results in a new expression for the quantized values of the wavevector in the @xmath20 direction , which read @xmath92 . for the metallic ( 10,10 )",
    "nanotube , an energy gap thus opens at the fermi level , whose width @xmath75 is proportional to the magnetic strength for @xmath93 .",
    "given that @xmath83 is a function of @xmath90 , a shift of the energy positions of the vhss follows , as well as the breaking of the degeneracy of a pair of @xmath64 and @xmath65 points contributing to a given vhs , as explained below .",
    "in the ( 10,10 ) nanotube , the first five vhss ( which each have a degeneracy of 4 ) are simply given by @xmath94 which leads to @xmath95  ev , @xmath96  ev , @xmath97  ev , @xmath98  ev , and @xmath99  ev . then phase shifts induced by the magnetic field correspond simply to @xmath100 this is illustrated in fig.2 , which gives the evolution of the tdos of a ( 10,10 ) nanotube close to some vhs .    at low field ,",
    "the degeneracy of the @xmath64 and @xmath65 points is broken as illustrated in fig.3 , which shows the brillouin zone for 2d graphite along with the equi - energy contours around @xmath64 and @xmath65 points , so that in addition to the upshift of one component of the degenerate zero - field vhss , the other magnetically - split component is correspondingly downshifted .",
    "both vhss move apart up to @xmath101 , where the two originally different vhss merge into one .",
    "the positions of such merged vhss are related to a @xmath102 factor ( that is , through a @xmath103 factor ) , so that a further increase of the magnetic field strength yields an opposite shifting of the vhs positions , and at @xmath104 , the initial positions of the vhss are recovered , along with their degeneracy ( those given at @xmath105 ) , and a gap closing thus results . at low magnetic field since @xmath106 , the shift of vhss position for a given magnetic field is proportional to @xmath58 for all vhss . in the inset of fig.2",
    ", the positions of the vhss originally at @xmath107ev ( for zero field ) , is given as a function of the normalized magnetic flux .",
    "the splitting is illustrated and a strong shift of the lowest vhs , by @xmath108ev is predicted at half a quantum flux unit . note that the upshifted and downshifted components are symmetrical with respect to the @xmath58-axis .",
    "= 9.2 cm    the tdos of the semiconducting @xmath109 nanotube is also investigated and displays similar features , as exemplified by fig.4 .",
    "the inset gives the shifting of the energy position of the three vhss , closest to the fermi level as a function of normalized magnetic flux .",
    "an interesting @xmath6 symmetry is clearly seen for semiconducting tubes , as in the former case ( fig.2 ) for metallic nanotubes .",
    "these interesting effects of the magnetic field on the spectral structure has , to our knowledge , not been explicitly investigated experimentally up to now , but recent progress in the observation of room temperature resonant raman spectra for purified single - wall nanotubes can disclose fine structure in the dos , through the enhancement of the intensity of optical absorption at the energies associated with vhss.@xcite magneto - optical techniques could then provide a possible way to test the above predictions . to that end , we give here the predicted energy position shifts for the vhss closest to the fermi energy , which are related to the phase shift induced by magnetic flux variations from 0 to @xmath6 for nanotubes with diameters @xmath110 nm ( the largest swnt made up to now ) , @xmath111 nm and @xmath112 nm ( corresponding to typical mwnt outer diameters ) and corresponding to @xmath13 armchair tubes .",
    "the predicted energy position shift is given by @xmath113 which implies @xmath114mev , @xmath115mev and @xmath116mev , and the corresponding magnetic field strengths at @xmath6 are @xmath117 t @xmath118 t , @xmath119 t , which are within the scope of present experimental capabilities ( we take @xmath120 , and @xmath121tm@xmath122 ) .",
    "note that the effect of the magnetic field should be observed for individual mwnts , since the inter - tube coupling for mwnts is believed to affect the electronic spectrum weakly . whereas the splitting is universal for all tubes ( chiral and achiral ) , in the most general case ,",
    "the van hove singularity shift will depend on the chirality , and on the applied magnetic field strength ( not the position of the van hove singularity ) . to estimate the corresponding shift ,",
    "one may proceed in the following manner : given a chiral vector @xmath9 , one calculates the associated vectors @xmath123 and @xmath124 which are drawn in the brillouin zone .",
    "this is here illustrated for the @xmath125 armchair for which @xmath126 with @xmath127 , the number of hexagons within the unit cell of a ( 10,10 ) nanotube , and @xmath128 the basis vector in reciprocal space ( see ref . ) , where the direction @xmath124 is found to be perpendicular to the @xmath129-axis ( fig.3 ) , and the spacing between lines is equidistant to a given @xmath64-point .",
    "for the ( 18,2 ) chiral nanotube with @xmath130 , we find @xmath131 which defines another direction and spacing .",
    "no lines cross at @xmath64 and @xmath65 points , and the spacings between two consecutive lines are not equidistant to the @xmath64-location ( in fact the @xmath64 point always appears to be one - third of the distance between the two lines near the fermi energy ) .",
    "this affects the splitting , for instance at the field corresponding to half a quantum flux unit , the pattern for the @xmath109 nanotube is much less simple than that for the @xmath125 nanotube but it can be evaluated systematically .",
    "perpendicular case for a magnetic field perpendicular to the nanotube axis , the situation is more cumbersome , due to a site - position dependence of the vector potential .",
    "no apparent symmetries for the aharonov ",
    "bohm interferences on the nanotube are found in this case , and indeed , even if semiconducting nanotubes can become metallic with increasing magnetic field strength , non - periodic - oscillations are found , as described below . for @xmath132",
    "normal to the tube axis , one starts from a vector potential , given in the two - dimensional coordinate system @xmath133 ) , by @xmath134 the effect of the magnetic field is driven by the phase factors introduced into the hopping integrals between two sites @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( with @xmath137 , and the phase factor can be deduced from the peierls substitution as follows , @xmath138 : @xmath139 } } & ( \\delta { \\cal x } \\neq 0)\\\\ { \\displaystyle \\frac { |     \\vec{\\cal c}_{h } |}{2\\pi } b\\delta { \\cal y } \\sin \\frac{2\\pi } { |     \\vec{\\cal c}_{h } | } { \\cal x } } & ( \\delta { \\cal x } = 0)\\\\      \\end{array }     \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath140 and @xmath141@xcite . in fig.1 ( b ) , we show the total density of states ( tdos ) at the fermi level ( @xmath142 ) as a function of the effective magnetic field defined by @xmath143 , where @xmath144 is the magnetic length . at low fields , the tdos of metallic-(9,0 ) and semiconducting-(10,0 ) nanotubes at the fermi level increases with the magnetic field strength . for higher values of magnetic field ,",
    "our results are in agreement with previous results obtained by exact diagonalization.@xcite also landau bands are generated for values for which @xmath145 .",
    "the aperiodic fluctuations of the tdos are stronger at higher fields , with occasional low values of the dos , reminiscent of a non - zero dos for the semiconducting nanotubes at the zero - field value .    in fig.[figo ] , several values of @xmath29 are considered for an initially semiconducting nanotube . for @xmath146",
    "the radius of the nanotube equals the magnetic length .",
    "landau levels emerge whenever the magnetic length becomes smaller than the nanotube circumference length.@xcite comparison of the case of @xmath147 in fig.5 with the zero - field limit is instructive , since the vhs partition of the spectra has been totally replaced by a landau level spectrum ( here , one can recognize square - root singularities for the vhss , and a lorentzian - shape singularity for the landau levels ) .",
    "this transition from the vhs - pattern to the landau - level pattern is , however , more unlikely to be observed experimentally , since its observation requires a very high magnetic field .",
    "the effect of anderson - type disorder on the electronic properties in addition to the presence of a magnetic field is now addressed in order to investigate how disorder alters the vhs - pattern and the metal - insulator transition ( mit ) , and how disorder qualitatively modifies the localization properties of the nanotubes when the system remains metallic .",
    "we consider here only the case of the metallic zigzag nanotube ( 9,0 ) , but similar results are obtained for other metallic or semiconducting nanotubes . in zero magnetic field , this problem of localization in nanotubes has recently attracted a great deal of attention.@xcite    the effect of randomness is considered by taking the site energies of the tight - binding hamiltonian at random in the interval @xmath148 $ ] , with a uniform probability distribution .",
    "accordingly , the strength of the disorder is measured by @xmath149 .",
    "significant fluctuations in the local density of states ( ldos ) are found as shown in fig.[fig7 ] ( for @xmath101 ) .",
    "the tdos for @xmath150 up to @xmath151 ( @xmath152 of the total bandwidth ) shows that disorder does not modify the gap at the fermi level , even when the confinement effects disappear ( vanishing of vhss ) .",
    "disorder obviously leads to a mixing of energy levels which results in a vanishing of the vhs at @xmath153 in our simulations .",
    "the gap is more resistant to disorder , even when its strength is as large as @xmath152 the total bandwidth .",
    "thus magnetic effects are not affected by low levels of disorder , which is an interesting result , since it is believed that many defects or sources of weak scattering should be present in real nanotubes .",
    "the estimation of the electron mean free path ( @xmath154 ) in nanotubes is relevant for determining which is the most likely transport regime ( ballistic versus diffusive ) , and further tells us whether or not the conductance should be quantized .",
    "while some experiments have observed conductance quantization,@xcite others suggest , in contrast , rather short electronic coherence lengths.@xcite a calculation of @xmath154 for armchair nanotubes has been performed using the special symmetries of these systems.@xcite here , we show that a simple recourse to the relaxation time approximation ( rta ) in the limit of weak scattering is sufficient to give a fair estimate of @xmath154 for both chiral or achiral tubes , in qualitative agreement with prior results,@xcite demonstrated for the armchair case . within the rta",
    ", one can write @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is an average of the group velocity over the fermi surface , @xmath157 is the mean free time , and @xmath158 is the self energy due to scattering events .",
    "the calculation of the electronic velocity is performed by a linearization of the dispersion relations in the vicinity of the fermi level . for all metallic nanotubes",
    ", one finds to the lowest order of approximation that @xmath159 which leads typically to @xmath160ms@xmath161 . on the other hand , in the vicinity of the fermi level ,",
    "the density of states is given by @xmath162\\\\ &     = & { \\displaystyle \\frac{2}{\\tilde{\\ell } } \\sum_{n } \\int dk     \\delta(k - k_{n})\\times \\left| \\frac{\\partial     \\varepsilon_{nk}}{\\partial k } \\right|^{-1 } } \\\\ & = & { \\displaystyle     \\frac{2}{\\pi \\gamma_{0 } \\sqrt{n^{2}+m^{2}+nm } } }      \\label{eqr1 }     \\end{array}\\ ] ] where @xmath163 is the volume of @xmath164-space per allowed @xmath164 value , divided by the spacing between lines for these allowed values .",
    "equation([eqr1 ] ) gives the tdos per unit length of metallic cns along the direction of the tube axis .",
    "application of the fermi golden rule yields @xmath165 , where @xmath149 is the disorder bandwidth and @xmath166 is the average of the local on - site green function elements .",
    "an estimate of the carrier mean free path ( identical for metallic nanotubes with the same radius ) is : @xmath167 the important result that @xmath154 is proportional to the nanotube diameter is relevant to the fact that the dos at the fermi energy decreases with increasing diameter .",
    "thus , for a given disorder acting as a weak perturbation coupling some eigenstates to others close to fermi surface , there are less available states to be scattered into , as the tube diameter decreases , yielding an enhancement of the mean free path .",
    "for instance for ( 9,0 ) and ( 10,10 ) cns , with respective diameters 0.7 nm and 1.37 nm , the corresponding mean - free paths are estimated to be @xmath168 and @xmath169 , which are much larger than the circumference length and are about the typical length of the systems themselves ( for a reasonable disorder @xmath170 suggested by ref . ) . in experiments on swnts , or mwnts in the metallic - like regime ( i.e. , with an ohmic temperature dependence of the resistivity ) ,",
    "the resistivity should scale as @xmath171 for a given temperature , where @xmath172 is the tube diameter .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze the departure from this law as the diameter of the mwnts increases , since such departures would indicate a participation of the inner tubes to the measured transport regime .",
    "in particular , some activation transport process of inner semiconducting tubes may contribute or not , depending on the temperature , and thus producing superimposed @xmath173 factors ( where @xmath174 is a constant ) .",
    "one notes that the fermi golden rule does not include the quantum interferences which lead to localization .",
    "as nanotubes are basically 1d - systems , from their estimated mean free paths , one can estimate the localization lengths at the fermi level following the thouless argument.@xcite in thin wires , thouless argued that by writing @xmath175 for the resistance , there should be a transition to a localized state and an exponential increase of the resistance @xmath176 .",
    "consequently , from the resistance @xmath177 ( @xmath178 is the conductance , @xmath179 the conductivity and @xmath180 the dimension of the system ) , assuming that the conductivity is calculated for a free electron gas in the wire ( @xmath181 ) , it is straightforward to deduce the localization length @xmath182 ( we take @xmath183 as the cross section of the wire and @xmath184 as the wire length for which @xmath185 ) . rewriting the last expression as @xmath186 , the localization length @xmath187 is shown to be related to the approximate number of independent electrons ( with spatial extension @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the fermi wavelength ) which can be accommodated through the cross - section of a single tube times the average mean free path .",
    "when confinement effects appear in the direction perpendicular to the cylinder axis , the number of allowed states reduces to the number of bands crossing at the fermi level ( conduction modes ) , since quantization prevails , and thus @xmath190@xcite , with @xmath191 , the number of bands crossing the fermi level for metallic nanotubes . accordingly , for the @xmath125 nanotube , the localization length is estimated to be @xmath192@xmath4 m",
    "so that it is typically larger or similar to a typical nanotube length and thus no special effects due to localization ( insulating regime ) are to be expected in swnts . with respect to the magnetic field",
    ", renormalization group arguments suggest that the localization lengths will be weakly affected by the magnetic field @xcite in quasi-1d systems .",
    "however , transport properties may be affected by the dephasing magnetic length @xmath193 which is @xmath194 nm or @xmath195 nm , respectively , for @xmath196tesla or @xmath197tesla .",
    "two cases may be distinguished , whenever the mean free path is much larger than the nanotube circumference . indeed , following beenakker and van houten @xcite , and noticing that in the case of a nanotube , the cross section of the quantum wire reduces to @xmath198 , the magnetic phase relaxation time @xmath199 for weak and strong magnetic field limits",
    "can be written as follows ( for @xmath200 ) :      so for the considered @xmath202 and @xmath125 tubes , we find that @xmath203 nm and @xmath204 nm respectively ( we take @xmath205nm@xcite and @xmath206ev@xcite ) .",
    "thus for @xmath196tesla we conclude that @xmath207 which is an intermediate situation between low and strong magnetic field , and no analytical expression of @xmath199 can be deduced , whereas @xmath197tesla is closer to the strong magnetic field limit where magnetic phase relaxation can be estimated analytically by @xmath208 which gives for the @xmath125 armchair nanotube a dephasing rate of @xmath209 .",
    "this means that for an @xmath125 armchair tube , the electronic phase is randomized by a 10 tesla magnetic field roughly every 30ps , which indicates that in the strong field limit , the dephasing rate due to a magnetic field is just a few times the mean free times ( we find @xmath210 with the aforementioned parameters ) , so that @xmath199 should strongly contribute to damp the quantum interferences in the weak localization regime .",
    "actually , both the mean free time and the magnetic dephasing rate scale linearly with diameter .",
    "inelastic dephasing rates due to electron - phonon coupling have been recently evaluated by suzuura and ando@xcite , and an interesting chirality - dependent dominant inelastic backscattering mechanism ( breathing , stretching versus twisting@xcite ) was revealed . from their analytical estimate of the electron - phonon inelastic scattering rate ( @xmath211 ) , in the @xmath125 armchair case",
    ", one finds at room temperature @xmath212 which is much larger than former estimated coherence times ( elastic mean free time and magnetic dephasing rate ) , so that one deduces that the main damping effect for the weak localization regime is likely to be dominated by the magnetic field strength .",
    "finally , with regard to the experimental results@xcite , one notices that if electronic transport is conveyed only by the outer shell of a metallic - like nanotube , as the magnetic field tends to decrease the tdos at discrete values of the magnetic field corresponding to @xmath213 with integer @xmath31 , an increase of resistance may follow from increasing the magnetic field .",
    "however , the short electronic coherence lengths that are observed in a magnetic field , the negative magnetoresistance and the @xmath6 aharonov  bohm oscillatory pattern are unlikely to be fully due to spectral effects ( on the density of states ) , and a calculation of diffusion coefficients is mandatory to account for interferences between propagating electronic pathways in the nanotube structure .",
    "a recent study of the kubo formula has been performed in ref . and gives a geometrical explanation for the enhanced backscattering in mwnts .",

    "<S> the electronic properties of carbon nanotubes are investigated in the presence of disorder and a magnetic field parallel or perpendicular to the nanotube axis . in the parallel field geometry , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-periodic metal - insulator transition ( mit ) induced in metallic or semiconducting nanotubes is shown to be related to a chirality  dependent shifting of the energy of the van hove singularities ( vhss ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of disorder on this magnetic field - related mechanism is considered with a discussion of mean free paths , localization lengths and magnetic dephasing rate in the context of recent experiments .    </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of multiwall carbon nanotubes ( cns ) by iijima@xcite , has triggered a huge amount of activity from basic research to applied technologies.@xcite indeed , cns have unique physical properties , from their light weight and record - high elastic modulus , to their geometry - dependent electronic states . lately </S>",
    "<S> , there has been increasing industrial interest in cn properties for their applicability to flat displays , fiber reinforcement technologies , carbon - based nanotips@xcite , and future cn - based molecular electronic devices.@xcite cns consist of coaxially rolled graphene sheets determined by only two integers @xmath1 , and depending on the choice of chirality , metallic or semiconducting behavior is exhibited for systems with typical radii of @xmath2 to @xmath3 nm and lengths of several @xmath4 m . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the influence of a magnetic field and topological defects@xcite or chemical ( e.g. , substitutional)@xcite disorder is a current subject of concern , since disorder can strongly affect the generic properties of cn - based devices , such as field effect transistors.@xcite conductivity measurements have been performed on bundles of single - walled carbon nanotubes using scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm).@xcite by moving the tip along the length of the nanotubes , sharp deviations in the @xmath5 characteristics could be observed and related to theoretically predicted electronic properties.@xcite in particular , the partition of the spectrum into a complex van hove singularity ( vhs ) pattern is a remarkable feature . at energies where vhss occur , </S>",
    "<S> the band velocities tend to zero , which is a manifestation of confined states , generally seen in 1d or 2d systems , and is due to the special symmetries of a given periodic structure . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus expected that the presence of vhss ( distribution and number ) also affect the physical properties of cns . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has been shown that from vhs - patterns , one could distinguish between different nanotube chiralities,@xcite which is an interesting approach for obtaining a more precise knowledge of the effect of geometry on the physical properties of cns , such as transport .    in this context , experiments with a magnetic field perpendicular@xcite or parallel to the nanotube axis@xcite </S>",
    "<S> have been performed , and in the latter case , @xmath6-periodic ( where @xmath7 is a flux quantum ) aharonov  bohm oscillations of the magneto - conductance have been found,@xcite suggesting rather short electronic coherence lengths . </S>",
    "<S> fujiwara et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite also observed a surprising @xmath8-oscillation in the magnetoconductance and related this periodic behavior to a superposition of phase shifts due to spectral effects , assuming three internal tubes with different chiralities . in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we propose to clarify the effect of a magnetic field on the density of states ( dos ) with respect to the field orientation relative to the nanotube axis , and the influence that disorder , as featured by random site energies , may have on these magnetic field effects . </S>",
    "<S> we further derive some criteria for estimating the mean free path and localization length qualitatively in this general context . </S>"
