    "single - photon light pulses are a central ingredient of quantum - teleportation and quantum - communication protocols as well as quantum computation with linear optics @xcite .",
    "many of these schemes are based on the quantum interference of two indistinguishable photons that impinge simultaneously on different entrance ports of a 50:50 beam splitter . in this case , both photons leave the beam splitter at the same output port .",
    "this quantum interference effect was first observed by hong , ou and mandel with photons from a parametric down - conversion source @xcite .",
    "when the two photons had different frequencies , a spatial quantum - beat phenomenon was observed @xcite .",
    "the two - photon quantum interference effect has also been observed with photons from independent down - conversion sources @xcite , and the phenomenon has been used by santori et al.@xcite to demonstrate the indistinguishability of photons emitted from a quantum dot embedded in a microcavity .",
    "a theoretical description that applies to the interference of independent single photons has been worked out by bylander et al.@xcite .",
    "so far , all these experiments use photons that are short compared to the time resolution of the employed photodetectors , and temporal effects are therefore neglected .",
    "however , we have recently developed a novel type of single - photon emitter that employs a strongly coupled atom - cavity system @xcite to emit single - photon wave packets of @xmath0s duration .",
    "this exceeds the typical response time of solid - state photodetectors by more than three orders of magnitude and allows to study two - photon quantum interference effects in a time - resolved manner .",
    "this paper therefore presents a detailed analytical treatment of the two - photon interference process .",
    "it takes into account the time evolution of the amplitudes and phases of the interfering single - photon wave packets .",
    "the analysis is valid for independent photons , and therefore extends the model for frequency - entangled photon pairs from steinberg et al .",
    "@xcite .    while preparing this paper , we realised that apparently there is no commonly adopted approach to deal with free - running single - photon wave packets @xcite .",
    "one possibility is to express the quantum state of a single - photon wave packet as a superposition state of an infinite number of single - frequency modes , another approach uses a superposition state of spatio - temporal modes . to demonstrate that these approaches lead to the same result , we now analyse the two - photon interference effect along both routes .     on ports ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' of a beam splitter . the pulse duration is longer than the time resolution of the detectors monitoring ports ` 3 ' and ` 4 ' of the beam splitter",
    "therefore , the time difference , @xmath1 , between two photon detections must be taken into account in the analysis of the photon statistics .",
    "[ beam splitter],width=302 ]",
    "as a starting point for the following discussion , we first review the two - photon interference phenomenon in the fock - state picture , i.e. we consider two single photons that impinge on the entrance ports labelled ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' of the beam splitter shown in fig.[beam splitter ] .",
    "this initial situation corresponds to the quantum state @xmath2 , which is obtained by applying the appropriate photon - creation operators @xmath3 on the vacuum state @xmath4 .",
    "the effect of the 50:50 beam splitter on the field is usually described by the unitary transformations , @xmath5 if we use these relations to express the initial state in terms of photons created in the two output ports labelled ` 3 ' and ` 4 ' , we immediately see that this leads to an entangled state with either both photons in one or the other output port , @xmath6 ^ 2-[a^\\dag_{4}]^2)|0\\rangle\\\\ & = ( |2_{3}0_{4}\\rangle-|0_{3}2_{4}\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}. \\end{array}\\ ] ] this simple picture qualitatively explains the observed interference phenomena , but since the photonic modes that belong to the creation operators are neither specified in space , frequency nor time ( albeit they are assumed to be identical for both photons ) , quantitative results for photon wave packets can not be obtained from this approach .      to obtain more insight , we now consider a description of the arriving single - photon wave packets in the space - time domain .",
    "the free - running photons are not subject to boundary conditions that restrict the photon creation and annihilation operators , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , to specific frequency modes",
    ". therefore we are free to define these operators in such a way that they create or annihilate photons in arbitrarily chosen modes ( labelled by the index @xmath9 ) in space and time , which we define by the one - dimensional spatio - temporal mode functions @xmath10 beside an arbitrary phase evolution , @xmath11 , the mode functions incorporate amplitude envelopes , @xmath12 , which are assumed to be normalised so that @xmath13 . by placing the beam splitter at @xmath14",
    ", we can omit the spatial coordinate , @xmath15 , in the following .",
    "now we assume that the whole hilbert space is spanned by an orthonormal set of spatio - temporal modes , @xmath16 , so that the electric field operators read @xmath17 provided a photon is present in mode @xmath18 , the probability to measure it at a given time @xmath19 then is @xmath20 which is solely defined by the amplitude envelope of the photon , @xmath21 . to analyse the effect of the beam splitter , we now attribute field operators , @xmath22 , to each of the four input / output ports . for the two input ports we only consider the occupied modes which are described by the mode functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "this restricts the hilbert subspaces of the input ports to single modes .",
    "therefore the field operators that belong to the two input ports can be written as @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively . using these operators ,",
    "the effect of the beam splitter is now described as a transformation between input and output modes : @xmath27/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ & = [ \\zeta_{1}(t)a_{1}+\\zeta_{2}(t)a_{2}]/\\sqrt{2}\\\\[2 mm ] \\hat e_4^+(t)&=[\\hat e_1^+(t)-\\hat e_2^+(t)]/\\sqrt{2}\\\\ & = [ \\zeta_{1}(t)a_{1}-\\zeta_{2}(t)a_{2}]/\\sqrt{2 } \\end{array } \\label{bsfield}\\ ] ] note that this is a more general form than the simple operator relation eq.([bsop ] ) , which is equivalent to eq.([bsfield ] ) if all mode functions , @xmath28 , are equal .      to obtain the probability for photon detections in the output ports ` 3 ' and",

    "the incoming state is @xmath33 , and the joint probability for photon detections reads @xmath34 with the field - operator relations defined in eq.([bsfield ] ) and the restriction to single - photon states , i.e.  using @xmath35 , one easily verifies that eq.([pcomb2 ] ) leads to @xmath36 the most striking feature of this joint probability function is that it vanishes for @xmath37 , no matter how different the mode functions of the two incoming photons are .",
    "moreover , if the phase relation between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is lost for @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the mutual coherence time of the incoming photons , the interference term in eq.([pcomb ] ) , averaged over an ensemble of different photon pairs , is zero , and @xmath42 reduces to @xmath43      despite the fact that the full interference phenomenon is described by eq.([pcomb ] ) , it is hard to acquire an intuitive understanding of the interference process from the two - photon approach .",
    "this is not the case if one analyses the effect step - by - step .",
    "we therefore use the same spatio - temporal mode functions as before and ask now for the probability to detect a photon in output port ` 4 ' at time @xmath30 conditioned on a photon detection in output port ` 3 ' at time @xmath29 . the probability to find a photon in port ` 3 ' reads @xmath44 \\langle 1_{1}1_{2}|(\\hat e_{1}^-(t_{0})+\\hat e_{2}^-(t_{0}))\\frac{1}{2}(\\hat e_{1}^+(t_{0})+\\hat e_{2}^+(t_{0}))|1_{1}1_{2}\\rangle = \\\\[2 mm ] \\displaystyle \\frac{1}{2}(|\\epsilon_{1}(t_{0})|^2+|\\epsilon_{2}(t_{0})|^2 ) . \\end{array } \\label{p3}\\ ] ] note that this expression includes no interference term , since the initial product state is composed of single - photon fock states that have no relative phase .",
    "the state @xmath45 , conditioned on the detection of a photon in port ` 3 ' at time @xmath29 , is obtained by applying the field operator @xmath46 to the incoming state , @xmath47 .",

    "this photon now gives rise to classical interference fringes that start in phase at time @xmath29 , i.e. the second photon is found in the same port as the first photon if it is detected at the same instant .",
    "however , the phase evolves in time according to @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "therefore the probabilities to detect the second photon in output ports ` 3 ' or ` 4 ' at time @xmath30 read @xmath51 & = \\displaystyle \\frac{|\\zeta_{1}(t_{0}+\\tau)\\zeta_{2}(t_{0})\\pm \\zeta_{2}(t_{0}+\\tau)\\zeta_{1}(t_{0})|^2}{2(|\\epsilon_{1}(t_{0})|^2+|\\epsilon_{2}(t_{0})|^2)}. \\end{array } \\label{p4}\\ ] ] together with eq.([p3 ] ) , the joint photon - detection probability for a first detection in output port ` 3 ' at time @xmath29 and a subsequent photon detection in output port ` 4 ' at time @xmath30 is @xmath52 result ( [ pcomb1 ] ) is identical to expression ( [ pcomb ] ) .",
    "however , the step - by - step analysis reveals the equivalence between classical one - photon interference and two - photon interference conditioned on the detection of a first photon .",

    "therefore the sequence of operators is irrelevant , and for negative detection - time delay , @xmath1 , which corresponds to a reverse order of photon detections , the same results are obtained .      a standard way to attack the problem of two interfering photons is based on the decomposition of single - photon wave packets into an infinite number of single - frequency field modes .",
    "to do so , a single photon in one of the two spatio - temporal input modes @xmath54 is expressed as one quantum of excitation occupying a superposition of all possible frequency modes , @xmath55 where the spectral amplitude of the single - photon pulse , @xmath56 , is assumed to be normalised so that @xmath57 .",
