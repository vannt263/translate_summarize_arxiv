    "the type - ia supernova observations  @xcite have shown that our universe is undergoing a late - time accelerating expansion , which is caused by dark energy  @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to realize such a late - time accelerating mechanism is to introduce a cosmological constant to the gravitational theory , such as that in the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "this model fits current cosmological observations very well , but exists several difficulties , such as the  fine - tuning \"  @xcite and `` coincidence ''  @xcite problems .    in this work",
    ", we will concentrate on the latter problem  @xcite , which has been extensively explored in the literature .",
    "one of the popular attempts is the running @xmath1 model , in which the cosmological constant evolves in time and decays to matter in the evolution of the universe  @xcite , so that the present energy densities of dark energy and dark matter are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "its observational applications have been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in our study , we are interested in the specific model with @xmath6  @xcite , which would originate from the theory with the qcd vacuum condensation associated with the chiral phase transition  @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the cosmological constant decays to matter ( non - relativistic ) and radiation ( relativistic ) , leading to a large number of particles created in the cosmological evolution . without loss of generality , we phenomenologically extend this model to include that @xmath1 additionally couples to radiation with @xmath0  @xcite , in which the @xmath1cdm limit can be realized if @xmath2 . in this scenario ,",
    "when dark energy dominates the universe , the decay rate of @xmath1 is reduced , and the late - time accelerating phase occurs , describing perfectly the evolution history of the universe . as a result , it is reasonable to go further to analyze the cosmological behavior of this model at the sub - horizon scale .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the matter power spectrum @xmath7 and cmb temperature perturbations in the linear perturbation theory of gravity . by using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method",
