    "constant mean curvature surfaces in @xmath6 are equilibria for the area functional , subject to an enclosed - volume constraint .",
    "the mean curvature is nonzero when the constraint is in effect , so we can scale and orient the surfaces to make their mean curvature @xmath7 , a condition we abbreviate by cmc . over the past two decades a great deal of progress has been made on understanding complete cmc surfaces and their moduli spaces ; however many interesting open problems remain .",
    "one of the most important questions concerns the possibility of decaying jacobi fields on complete cmc surfaces , that is , the morse - theoretic degeneracy of these equilibria .",
    "the main result of this paper is to rule out such jacobi fields on a large class of complete cmc surfaces .    for a given",
    "immersed surface @xmath8 , its mean curvature @xmath9 is determined by the quasilinear elliptic equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the ( mean curvature , or inner ) unit normal to @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the laplace - beltrami operator .",
    "the surface @xmath5 is cmc if @xmath14 .",
    "the oldest examples of cmc surfaces are the sphere of radius @xmath7 and cylinder of radius @xmath15 .",
    "interpolating between these two examples are the delaunay unduloids , which are rotationally symmetric and periodic .",
    "a delaunay unduloid is determined ( up to rigid motion ) by its necksize @xmath16 , which is the length of the smallest closed geodesic on the surface .",
    "a necksize of @xmath17 corresponds to a cylinder of radius @xmath15 , and as @xmath18 one obtains the singular limit of a chain of mutually tangent unit spheres .",
    "the ode determining the delaunay surfaces still has global solutions when the necksize parameter is any negative number ; in this case the resulting delaunay nodoids are not embedded .    in the present paper",
    "we will study cmc surfaces in @xmath6 which are _ alexandrov - immersed_. a proper immersion @xmath8 is an alexandrov immersion if one can write @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a three - manifold into which the mean curvature normal @xmath21 points , and @xmath12 extends to a proper immersion of @xmath20 into @xmath6 . in the finite topology",
    "cmc setting , @xmath20 is necessarily a handlebody with a solid cylinder attached for each end .",
    "for example , the delaunay unduloids are alexandrov - immersed ( in fact , embedded ) , but the delaunay nodoids are not .    in the remainder of this paper , all of the cmc surfaces",
    "are assumed to be complete , alexandrov immersions of finite topology , or subsets of such surfaces .",
    "it is a theorem of alexandrov @xcite that the only compact , connected , alexandrov - immersed , cmc surfaces are unit spheres . here",
    "we are primarily interested in noncompact cmc surfaces .",
    "korevaar , kusner and solomon @xcite proved that each end of such a cmc surface is exponentially asymptotic to a delaunay unduloid , that two - ended cmc surfaces are unduloids , and that three - ended cmc surfaces have a plane of reflection symmetry .",
    "in fact , all _ triunduloids _ ( three - ended , genus zero cmc surfaces ) were constructed and classified by groe - brauckmann , kusner and sullivan @xcite , as were all _ coplanar @xmath4unduloids _ ( @xmath4ended , genus zero cmc surfaces whose asymptotic axes all lie in a plane @xcite ) .",
    "these authors define a classifying map assigning each coplanar @xmath4unduloid an immersed polygonal disc with @xmath4 geodesic edges in @xmath22 , whose edge - lengths are the asymptotic necksizes of the corresponding @xmath4unduloid .",
    "the classifying map of @xcite is a homeomorphism , and gives information about the topological structure of moduli space of coplanar @xmath4unduloids . to obtain information about the smooth structure of moduli space",
    ", one needs to understand the linearization of the mean curvature operator , which is the jacobi operator @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the length of the second fundamental form of @xmath12 .",
    "solutions to the jacobi equation @xmath25 are called _ jacobi fields _ , and correspond to normal variations of the cmc surface @xmath5 which preserve the mean curvature to first order . more precisely ,",
    "if @xmath26 is a jacobi field , then the one - parameter family of immersions @xmath27 has mean curvature @xmath28 .",
    "thus one can think of jacobi fields as tangent vectors to the moduli space of constant mean curvature surfaces .    a surface @xmath0 is nondegenerate if the only solution @xmath29 to @xmath25 is the zero function .",
    "near a nondegenerate cmc surface @xmath5 , a theorem of kusner , mazzeo and pollack @xcite shows that the moduli space of cmc surfaces is a real - analytic manifold with coordinates derived from the asymptotic data of @xcite ( that is , the axes , necksizes , and neckphases of the unduloid asymptotes ) . in general the cmc moduli space is a real - analytic variety . indeed , on a degenerate cmc surface , there would be a nonzero @xmath2 jacobi field @xmath26 , which ( by @xcite ) decays exponentially on all ends .",
    "the presence of such a jacobi field means there exists a one - parameter family of surfaces @xmath30 with the same asymptotic data and with mean curvature @xmath31 , indicating a possible singularity in the cmc moduli space .",
    "thus , proving nondegeneracy eliminates the potential for such singularities .",
    "another application of nondegeneracy is to gluing constructions , where the pieces to be glued are nondegenerate minimal or cmc surfaces .",
    "here one looks for cmc surfaces @xmath32 which are near a given surface @xmath5 , which may or may not have constant mean curvature .",
    "writing the nearby surface @xmath32 as a normal graph over @xmath5 , with graphing function @xmath26 , we see that @xmath33 .",
    "we take the mean curvature of @xmath12 to be @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a small , but otherwise unrestricted , function .",
    "thus , ignoring the higher order terms , finding the nearby cmc surface @xmath36 is equivalent to solving the linear differential equation @xmath37 , with growth and/or boundary conditions on @xmath26 .",
    "the nondegeneracy of @xmath12 allows one to solve this , while controlling @xmath26 in an appropriate norm .",
    "an early example of this method is smale s bridge principle @xcite , which produces a new nondegenerate minimal surface as the boundary - connected sum of two nondegenerate minimal surfaces along a thin bridge .",
    "( kapouleas @xcite had earlier constructed many new examples of complete , noncompact cmc surfaces in @xmath6 by gluing delaunay ends and spheres together .",
    "although he did not explicitly mention nondegeneracy , his construction used a balancing condition to overcome the translation - degeneracy of the sphere . ) recently , a more flexible gluing technique @xcite has been used to explore the moduli space theory of cmc surfaces : it involves solving several boundary value problems and then matching cauchy data across interfaces , but again the gluing pieces must be suitably nondegenerate .",
    "our main theorem bounds the dimension of the space of @xmath2 jacobi fields on a large class of cmc surfaces , and as a corollary shows that almost all triunduloids are nondegenerate .",
    "[ main - thm ] let @xmath0 be a coplanar @xmath4unduloid .",
    "then the space of @xmath2 jacobi fields on @xmath5 is at most @xmath38dimensional .",

    "the spherical triangle inequalities imply @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "when these inequalities are strict , the vertices of the classifying triangle span @xmath6 , and so our main theorem asserts that the space of @xmath2 jacobi fields is @xmath43 .",
    "[ nondegen - thm ] let @xmath0 be a triunduloid .",
    "then @xmath12 is nondegenerate if its necksizes satisfy the strict spherical triangle inequalities .    when a coplanar @xmath4unduloid has cylindrical ends , theorem [ cyl - dim - bound ] improves the dimension bound in theorem [ main - thm ] , and shows many of these cmc surfaces are also nondegenerate ( see section [ questions ] ) .",
    "the main tool we develop is a conjugate jacobi field construction , which converts neumann fields to dirichlet fields .",
    "this conjugate variation field arises from linearizing the conjugate cousin construction of @xcite .",
    "although our result is similar in spirit to the nondegeneracy result of cosn and ros @xcite , their method relies on the conformality of the gauss map , and on the presence of a homothety jacobi field .",
    "both these properties are special to the minimal case and do not generalize to our cmc situation .",
    "this difference in the geometry forced us to develop a new approach .",
    "not only does it provide another proof of their nondegeneracy result , but also new insight into the classifying map for triunduloids and , more generally , for coplanar @xmath4unduloids ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our conjugate jacobi field construction also yields a simple , synthetic characterization of constant mean curvature in terms of a spinning sphere with speed @xmath44 along the surface ( see section [ moduli ] ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "notation and preliminary computations appear in section [ notation ] .",
    "the conjugate jacobi field construction is in section [ conj - var - sect ] . in section [ moduli ] we develop the spinning sphere characterization for cmc surfaces , and the interpretation of the classifying map for coplanar @xmath4unduloids .",
    "the proofs of theorem [ main - thm ] and corollary [ nondegen - thm ] are in section [ nondegen - sec ] .",
    "finally , we discuss some extensions and applications , as well as pose some related open questions , in section [ questions ] .    as with any mathematical problem which has been outstanding for so long",
    ", the present paper has benefited from fruitful discussion with many people . in particular , we wish to thank john sullivan , karsten groe - brauckmann and frank pacard for reading earlier drafts of this paper , and for their helpful suggestions .",
    "on a simply connected domain of a cmc ( or minimal ) surface , we find it convenient to use _ conformal curvature coordinates_. these are coordinates @xmath45 on a domain @xmath46 , so that the mapping @xmath47 which parameterizes the surface satisfies @xmath48 and the ( inner ) unit normal @xmath21 to the surface satisfies @xmath49 in other words , choosing conformal curvature coordinates amounts to simultaneously diagonalizing the first and second fundamental forms , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in these coordinates ,",
    "the shape operator @xmath52 is diagonal with the principal curvatures @xmath53 as its entries .",

    "one particular instance of the end - to - end gluing construction , doubling along an end , occurs when one glues @xmath5 to a copy of itself after truncating a particular end .    by corollary [ nondegen - thm ]",

    "any end of any such @xmath5 satisfies all the hypotheses for end - to - end gluing , and so one can double such a triunduloid along any of its ends .",

    "in addition , one can use end - to - end gluing to create nondegenerate cmc surfaces with any finite topology and no small necks .",
    "we now compare our proof and cosn and ros @xcite proof of the analogous result for genus zero , coplanar , minimal @xmath4noids . because of the special properties of finite total curvature minimal surfaces , they are able to prove that all bounded jacobi fields on @xmath12 are linear combinations of the components of the unit normal vector @xmath21 .",

    "next , given any bounded jacobi field @xmath26 on a finite total curvature minimal surface , one can construct an associated branched minimal surface @xmath483 with planar ends which has the same gauss map as @xmath5 , and has @xmath26 as its support function ( inner product of the position vector and unit normal vector , that is , the jacobi field corresponding to the invariance of the minimal surface equation under homothety ) .",
    "the conjugate surface @xmath484 is again a minimal surface with planar ends , and its support function @xmath339 again is a bounded jacobi field . since this conjugation from @xmath26 to @xmath317 interchanges neumann and",
    "dirichlet fields , cosn and ros conclude that the neumann fields on @xmath5 are ( multiples of ) the horizontal components of the unit normal .",
    "one can also prove their result using our methods . to prove the uniqueness of dirichlet jacobi fields , up to scaling",
    ", one can slightly modify our proof in appendix [ 2nd - dirichlet ] .",
    "the salient feature one must recall is that any bounded jacobi field @xmath26 has a decomposition on each end @xmath485 as @xmath486 where @xmath487 is the euclidean distance from the axis of the catenoid asymptote of @xmath485 , @xmath488 arises from translation along the asymptotic axis , and @xmath489 arise from translations perpendicular to the asymptotic axis .",
    "we will make the normalization that @xmath490 corresponds to vertical translations .",
    "in particular , if @xmath491 is dirichlet , then @xmath492 , and so the boundary terms in equation ( [ int - by - parts2 ] ) caused by spherical truncation approach zero .",
    "thus every bounded dirichlet jacobi field is a constant multiple of @xmath493 .",
    "one can then transform neumann jacobi fields to dirichlet jacobi fields using a construction analogous to our conjugate jacobi field construction of section [ conj - var - sect ] . in this case , the conjugate variation field @xmath185 satisfies @xmath494 now argue as in section [ neumann - sec ] , using the heights @xmath331 defined by equation ( [ heights ] ) , which still measure the vertical change in @xmath185 evolving by equation ( [ min - conj - var ] ) along @xmath205 . because equation ( [ min - conj - var ] ) contains no rotation term and @xmath495 on the ends , @xmath185 remains vertical along all the symmetry curves and at infinity .",
