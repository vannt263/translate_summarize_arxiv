    "on the other hand , pahs can be destroyed in hostile environments such as supernovae shocks @xcite .",
    "pahs can also be effectively destroyed in low - metallicity environments with hard ionization fields , due to reduced shielding by dust grains @xcite .",
    "some authors have explored the size distribution of pahs and suggested that there is a deficit of _ small _ pah molecules at low metallicites @xcite .",

    "however , the significant increase in the fraction of undetected 24@xmath0 m sources with increasing 32 ( from 38% to 91% , figure  [ fig : pah_ism]c ) suggests that the destruction of pahs in intense radiation fields may be the dominant physical mechanism . nevertheless , it is not trivial to completely differentiate between the various scenarios with our current data set .",
    "a potentially important trend observed in figure  [ fig : pah_mass ] is that above @xmath142 the @xmath5 ( or @xmath3/sfr ) reaches an almost constant value .",

    "this suggests that the constant value of @xmath5 at high metallicities is the `` intrinsic '' @xmath5 ratio .",
    "the suppressed @xmath5 at lower metallicities is indicative of preferential destruction of pahs in environments with lower dust opacity , and hence , with harder and more intense radiation fields .",
    "the paucity of pah molecules in young galaxies can also be attributed to the delayed production of pahs by agb stars and/or to the higher intensity of the radiation field in these young systems with high ssfr .",
    "the threshold at @xmath64 is the same as the value found by @xcite and close to the value 8.1 found by @xcite at @xmath61 .",
    "the lack of this threshold in n2 and o3n2 metallicity plots may be due to the potential bias of metallicity indicators involving nitrogen @xcite , which could increase the scatter in the metallicity calibrations .",
    "we present the first results of investigating variations of the brightest pah emission at 7.7@xmath0 m with metallicity and ionizing radiation intensity at high redshift . for this study ,",
    "we use the mosdef sample of star - forming galaxies at @xmath2 that covers a broad range of metallicities ( @xmath23 ) , stellar masses ( @xmath145 ) , and sfrs ( @xmath146 ) .",

    "2 .   there is a significant anti - correlation between the pah intensity and 32 .",
    "this trend is stronger than the correlation of pah with n2 and o3n2 , as the majority of 24@xmath0 m undetected galaxies have systematically high 32 ratios .",

    "the trends of the pah strength with 32 , o3n2 , and n2 suggest preferential destruction of pah molecules in low metallicity environments , characterized with harder and more intense radiation fields . additionally , there is a sharp difference in the pah intensity above and below 32 @xmath7 ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "this threshold is also observed at @xmath61 .",
    "we speculate that above this metallicity threshold dust opacity is high enough that pahs are no longer preferentially destroyed by ionizing photons , and hence , the @xmath5 ratio reaches a constant value .",
    "3 .   above the age of 600myr , we do not find a strong correlation between age and the pah intensity .",
    "however , the @xmath5 ratios of the youngest quartile of galaxies in our sample ( with ages @xmath6myr ) are significantly lower ( by a factor of @xmath89 ) than those of galaxies with ages @xmath88myr",
    ". the low pah intensity in young systems may be an indication of the delayed injection of pah molecules to the ism by carbon - rich agb stars .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that commonly - used conversions of @xmath3 ( or 24@xmath0 m flux density ; @xmath9 ) to @xmath4 underestimate the ir luminosity by more than a factor of 2 at @xmath10 . consequently , the sfr-@xmath11 relation has a shallower slope than previously derived from studies that neglected the metallicity dependence of the 24@xmath0m - to - ir conversion factor . </S>",
