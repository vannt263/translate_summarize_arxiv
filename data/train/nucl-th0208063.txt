    "a possible conclusion to be drawn from initial observations of inclusive charged particle spectra in au + au collisions at rhic , by the four detectors phobos @xcite , phenix @xcite , brahms @xcite and star @xcite , which observations , of course , are only of the final state of the collision , is that soft , strongly interacting qcd plays a dominant role in the dynamics . to be sure , there do exist potentially interesting anomalies in high @xmath4 charged @xcite and neutral @xcite pion spectra , among others .",
    "these occur for @xmath4 in the range @xmath5@xmath6 gev / c , involve only a small fraction of the integrated cross - section , and may in fact be describable by an energy loss mechanism for @xmath7 mesons acting in the later stages of a collision .    the hadronic simulation lucifer @xcite has already given a good description @xcite of the earliest phobos @xcite and star @xcite measurements of averaged mid - rapidity cross - sections for charged particles , @xmath8 for @xmath9 , including also a successful prediction @xcite of the surprisingly slight ( @xmath10@xmath11% ) rise in this observable as the collision energy is increased from @xmath12 gev to 200 gev .",
    "also correctly anticipated was the shape of the pseudo - rapidity spectrum for charged particles at higher values of @xmath13 @xcite .    here",
    ", we consider simulation results for the centrality dependence which is found by all of the detectors @xcite .",
    "these collaborations emphasize the variation of @xmath14 with the number of participants .",
    "this work concerns itself with comparisons of the spectral magnitudes and shapes as a function of centrality .",
    "the variation of experimentally defined centrality is directly related theoretically to changes in the impact parameter @xmath15 .",
    "the energy and geometrical dependence extracted from lucifer speak directly to assumptions underlying the cascade simulation , and to the nature and the number density of the resonance rescatterers employed in the model .    in earlier work",
    "@xcite we stressed that the role of our simulation was only to define the ` ordinary , ' giving experimentalists a background calculation against which to judge potentially unusual data .",
    "there do , of course , exist a variety of other simulations @xcite , having similar goals but differing approaches : some are purely partonic models and some are hybrid partonic - hadronic .",
    "it seems again appropriate to compare the , by now , extensive observations at rhic with simulations which do not assume that plasma is necessarily present .",
    "the purest such comparison would employ a model involving only colour singlet , hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the physical picture is one in which ion - ion collisions are describable in the main by multiple interactions between excited hadrons only . in such a picture , constituent quarks , present within original and produced baryons , are perhaps raised to states differing from those present in the lowest mass baryons , but glue holding the valence quarks in place remains ` sticky . '",
    "so quarks and gluons continue to act as if still confined within hadrons .",
    "in addition to excited baryons , color singlet bosonic degrees of freedom are produced and play a significant role .",
    "such a description has proven feasible in the pb + pb collisions examined in na49 @xcite .",
    "in fact , excited bosons only enter at a later stage of the simulation , often after some initial baryon - baryon interactions are completed .",
    "it remains to be seen whether at the higher energies of rhic a large number of partons , carrying a large fraction of the energy density , perhaps ` minijets ' @xcite , are in fact free and able to roam over large spatial distances , and more importantly whether sufficient ` free ' gluons are present to create the thermodynamic basis for material which could be described as quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the simulation we employ has two successive stages . in phase",
    "i , no energy is removed for soft processes .",
    "therefore , initial baryon - baryon interactions take place very nearly on the light cone .",
    "the construction of a collision history is guided by inputs from nn data , the key ones being : ( 1 ) absolute total cross - sections as a function of energy , ( 2 ) branching ratios for elastic and various inelastic processes and ( 3 ) multiplicity distributions for meson production .    our two body model has been discussed extensively in earlier work @xcite . it attempts to emulate multi - peripheral models of nucleon - nucleon scattering which divide the total cross - section into elastic , single diffractive and non - single diffractive @xcite processes .",
    "our assumption is that generic @xmath2-like and @xmath3-like resonances are the major rescatterers , _ only entering into phase ii _",
    ", of the simulation , which begins after a formation time @xmath16 , a central model parameter , has elapsed for particles produced in phase i , in their various rest frames .",
    "since these resonances themselves decay into multiple particles stable under the strong interaction on a time scale @xmath17 , which is a second important model parameter , their multiplicities must be adjusted appropriately so as to reproduce free space nn data , and they are in fact reduced in number by some two to three times relative to the expected multiplicity of stable mesons .",
    "importantly however , it then follows that any model reproducing the known nucleon - nucleon data , such as explicit string models @xcite , could have been employed up to the commencement of phase ii of the simulation .",
    "we use a resonance model of nucleon - nucleon scattering for reasons which will become clear as we proceed and because interactions which are particle - like in nature are easier to deal with than , say , the interactions of strings .",
    "we will discuss the spatial and energy densities of the ` rescatterers ' at some length in what follows and thus make evident a simplicity in both the energy and centrality dependence of the observed pseudo - rapidity densities which arises from such considerations .",
    "it appears that over an appreciable range of both energy and impact parameter , the density of generic hadronic resonances , built up during phase i , must remain nearly constant in ion - ion collisions , if the observed centrality and energy dependence of final charged particle spectra are to be correctly described .",
    "the extracted resonance size , assuming close packing or saturation , is eminently reasonable .",
    "we again adopt the position that the analysis for au + au at rhic simply presents an extrapolation from earlier na49 inclusive measurements @xcite to the considerably higher energy rhic collisions .",
    "we could equally well have normalized the absolute level of meson production to the lowest rhic energy ( @xmath18 gev ) .",
    "this normalization directly implies a determination of the average density of generic resonances , or rescatterers , in phase ii of the lucifer simulation for au + au , a theoretical observable which is then a single number characterising presently measured inclusive rhic physics .",
    "uniformity in resonance production is achieved by imposing an upper limit on total multiplicity in contiguous groups of interacting nucleons within an a + a event @xcite or , equivalently , by imposing a limit directly on the two body interactions themselves .",
    "this is accomplished by introducing this limit at a single energy .",
    "the density of the saturated resonance fluid is fixed by normalising the simulated multiplicity to the experimental multiplicity at a fixed total energy in a massive ( large a ) ion - ion collision .",
    "no such restriction is imposed on pure nn interactions , or for example p + d collisions .",
    "previously , @xcite we based our approach on ideas put forward by gottfried @xcite in describing p + a collisions . gottfried delayed interactions of particles produced in the successive nn interactions in a p + a collision , until the produced particles were physically sufficiently separated from each other and their progenitors to act as separate hadrons .",
    "the extra constraint which we impose , saturation of the rescatterer density in ion - ion collisions , may be occasioned when multiple resonances produced in neighbouring nn collisions interfere with one - another .",
    "it is almost self evident that individual resonances condensing from such two body collisions can not overlap .    after a short digression on the details of lucifer ,",
    "we develop the above ideas in two ensuing sections .",
    "first , comparisons are presented between the model and the experimental results at rhic from the various detectors , large and small .",
    "these include charged particle pseudo - rapidity measurements at @xmath19 for varying centrality , at the first rhic energy @xmath12 gev analysed in this fashion .",
    "also treated is the energy dependence for @xmath14 at @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath1 gev , using for the lowest energy , data which are available only from the phobos @xcite collaboration .",
    "also considered at @xmath12 gev , are the full pseudo - rapidity distributions for differing degrees of centrality .",
    "secondly , the distributions of underlying rescatterers , _ i.  e.  _ the dependence of the number of boson - like resonances , @xmath21 , on impact parameter and energy , are extracted from the simulations .",
    "the simple relations for the spatial and energy distributions thus obtained illuminate the physical basis for the overall simulation .",
    "in particular , the number density of meson resonances reached at the formation time @xmath16 , although not large , is sufficient to explain the observed stable meson production .",
    "the baryon density from the onset of an aa event up to the earliest formation time t=@xmath16 , involves far fewer particles , but could still in principle provide problems .",
    "the latter will be discussed at an appropriate point .",
    "for completeness we present a brief outline of the dynamics in lucifer @xcite .",
    "phase i has been adequately described above and sets the initial conditions for an ordinary hadronic cascade ( with energy loss ) in phase ii @xcite .",
    "the numbers and the properties ( flavour , mass , _ etc .",
    "_  ) of hadrons entering into phase ii are determined in phase i by recording all baryon - baryon collisions .",
    "providing complete initial conditions for phase ii requires us to specify four momenta and positions for the produced resonances .",
    "the positions are simply randomly distributed along the paths of nucleons colliding in phase i , while the momenta must conserve overall energy and momentum and be consistent with production and phase space in nn collisions .",
    "existing baryons acquire transverse momentum by making a random walk in the number of collisions , and softly produced meson resonances are given transverse momenta commensurate with soft production as observed in nn collisions .",
    "the total multiplicity of the resonances is restricted as described above .",
    "we reemphasise that the generic resonances first appear only in phase ii .",
    "the latter is a normal cascade in which energy is lost at each binary collision and during which the resonances both interact with each other and decay into pions and other stable particles .",
    "the restricted range of masses for the resonances , 300 - 1200 mev , or somewhat higher if strangeness is involved , guarantees we have only soft processes , _ i.  e.  _ that only relatively low @xmath4 is generated in the decays .",
    "we have listed the important two - body inputs in phase i , but we should make more explicit a very important feature in the elementary model , _ viz _ the energy dependence of the multiplicity distributions , which obey kno - scaling @xcite .",
    "our description of the scaling of the multiplicity distributions comes from fitting multi - prong data mostly drawn from the ua(5 ) experiment @xcite .",
    "central to this parameterization is the energy dependent average number of prongs @xmath22 entering through the definition of kno scaling    @xmath23    although we artificially limit the number of mesons produced in ion - ion collisions by our no - overlap constraint on the generic resonances , the energy dependence for increasing production of these particles still drives the final multiplicities as a function of @xmath24 . in figure [ fig : ua5dndeta ] we display a de facto prediction of the two body model , _",
    "i.  e. _  which arises via the energy dependence of @xmath25 .",
    "this is the comparison of calculated energy variation of central charged multiplicity , @xmath26 with data @xcite .",
    "since one is here dealing with a collision involving two incoming nucleons ( participants ) this quantity is , in effect , already divided by 1/2 times the number of participants .",
    "the slight increase predicted for the rise in @xmath14 for au + au , going from @xmath12 gev to @xmath1 gev , arises essentially completely from the energy dependence of @xmath27 : this dependence is weak in the two body data and equally weak for ion - ion collisions .",
    "this is a dynamic , and not merely kinematic , outcome of the simulation , but it is one which follows from the nn character of phase i.",
    "figure [ fig : olddndeta ] reviews earlier @xmath14 results for the most central collisions , indicating the predicted @xmath28-@xmath11% rise between @xmath12 and @xmath1 gev for au + au at rhic @xcite .",
    "a more complete picture of the variation in this pseudo - rapidity density @xmath14 for varying centrality cuts is shown in figure [ fig : dndetacentral ] with lucifer compared to the existing detector data @xcite for the @xmath20 gev runs .",
    "the centrality cuts on the simulation are defined in terms of the calculated @xmath29 , which is integrated to give the appropriate degree of centrality between limits @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "theoretical curves describing this @xmath15 dependence are shown in figure [ fig : bvscent ] .",
    "a more expeditious definition of the percentage centrality was employed earlier@xcite .",
    "this convenient geometrical definition is not necessarily in accord with actual experimental usage .",
    "the agreement between simulation and measurement persists out to rather high impact parameter , possibly deteriorating somewhat for @xmath33 fm . for peripheral collisions",
    "the ` constancy ' of resonance density , discussed in detail below , is not maintained in our saturated simulations .",
    "indeed for the most peripheral collisions , with say only a few nucleons colliding , there should be no multiplicity suppression .",
    "one should also confront the full pseudo - rapidity distributions insofar as they have been measured ; this we do in figure [ fig : pseudorapf ] using phobos data at @xmath12 gev @xcite .",
    "the higher energy @xmath34 yields similar comparisons . again",
    "the agreement in shape is seen to be adequate .",
    "so the most inclusive meson data , taken at @xmath12 gev , is well described by the present two phase cascade . finally , to demonstrate the similarity with other presentations of the data we include a plot , figure [ fig : partcomp ] , of participant nucleon number , @xmath35 , in lucifer versus the ` number of participants ' which was abstracted from two of the experiments .",
    "in the simulation we can easily estimate the total @xmath35 by counting the number of spectator nucleons ( they are just those initial nucleons which had no inelastic collisions in phase i or ii of the cascade ) in a sample of events having some fixed @xmath15 and subtracting that number from the total number of initial nucleons .",
    "of course only inelastic participants , which contribute to the multiplicity , must be selected for comparison with experiment where the distinction between ` inelastic ' participants and ` elastic ' participants becomes moot , so that another subtraction of purely elastic participants must be made theoretically .",
    "for the degree of centrality reached in the experiments , @xmath36 , this additional adjustment is small , but it would become an appreciable correction , tending to @xmath37 , in more peripheral events .",
    "most of the simulation results can be understood in terms of simply constructed model quantities . at the commencement of the ` soft ' cascade , phase ii",
    ", we constrained the system to avoid spatial overlap of the rescatterers . the extent to which this succeeds",
    "can be quantified as a function of impact parameter .",
    "plotted in figure [ fig : resb ] is the distribution of the @xmath2-like resonances as a function of @xmath15 , at the start of phase ii .",
    "there is of course a dispersion in the numbers @xmath21 , reflecting fluctuations from event to event , but a good estimate of the areal density of resonances can still be made .",
    "we use the term ` areal ' density in referring to the number of resonances in the area of overlap of the two nuclei , obtained when the overlap volume from phase i is projected into a plane transverse to the beam direction , for fixed impact parameter .",
    "the overlap volume or interaction region has , in our simulation of a gold - gold collision , for early times @xmath39 very nearly the form of a generalised cylinder .",
    "the directrix of this cylinder is a convex curve formed by the two circular arcs bounding the projection of the overlap volume of the spherical nuclei into the transverse plane .",
    "the generator of the cylinder is parallel to the beam direction and along the direction of longitudinal expansion of the interaction region .",
    "perhaps this volume could be appropriately be termed a ` fire cylinder . '",
    "the area in question then , is the transverse cross - section of the fire cylinder . taking the geometry of the two colliding nuclei to be sharply spherical , with radius r ,",
    "the area of overlap @xmath40 can be calculated :    @xmath41.\\ ] ]    for @xmath42 , the areal density of resonances is then found to be :    @xmath43    sample curves obtained for this density are exhibited in figure [ fig : sigma ] for varying choices of nuclear radius @xmath44 fm , the latter value being closer to the actual situation for gold nuclei , especially when the addition of a surface diffusivity converts the nuclear geometries into the more realistic forms we employ in the monte - carlo .",
    "this figure demonstrates , however , the near constancy of @xmath45 out to rather large separations of the colliding nuclei , @xmath46@xmath10 fm .",
    "this perhaps surprisingly accurate , but intuitively satisfying , uniformity of the resonance population of the fire cylinder is a representation of the constraints placed on production .",
    "the result of imposing constancy strictly out to @xmath47 fm is included in the above figure [ fig : dndetacentral ] .",
    "measurements seem to be telling us that indeed the transverse density @xmath48 varies very little",
    ".    a reasonable approach for still more peripheral events would be to smoothly cut off the degree of suppression of the resonance multiplicity , until for the most glancing collisions there was no multiplicity suppression at all , at which point one expects after all that only unadulterated two body reactions occur .",
    "the results for the latter eventuality are shown in figure [ fig : ua5dndeta ] , as explained previously a prediction of the elementary two - body model used here and extracted , in fact , from p+d reactions .",
    "it is more difficult to precisely define a volume for the interaction region or fire cylinder at the onset of phase ii of the simulation , the soft cascade . from figure",
    "[ fig : lightcone ] it is clear that after time @xmath49 in the center of momentum ( lab ) frame , up to the time of termination of phase ii , new resonances are continually appearing , at times related to their velocities @xmath50 via @xmath51 , @xmath52 being the lorentz factor peculiar to the @xmath53th resonance . in the final analysis ,",
    "a choice @xmath54 fm / c for the formation time was made , with globally similar results . in general",
    ", it is clear there is some interplay between @xmath16 and the overall normalisation of resonance number .",
    "a more extended delay time implies a more expanded system and less cascading in phase ii .",
    "too short a formation time could in fact lead to an inability for the simulation to keep within the experimental limits for total meson numbers .",
    "no such problem arises for the range of @xmath16 selected above , and these total numbers as a function of centality are well reproduced .    for these last issues of spatial densities",
    "we choose the most central collisions with @xmath55 , although little would be changed by using a fixed impact parameter .",
    "figure [ fig : gammaz ] demonstrates the strong interdependence between the number of resonances @xmath56 and the average longitudinal lorentz factor @xmath57 ( the averaging here is over all resonances ) .",
    "@xmath58 is directly related to the average length of the fire cylinder in the longitudinal direction :    @xmath59    the energy dependence of @xmath56 is then very simply and naturally described in figure [ fig : gammaz ] , and is another dynamical statement of the model .",
    "the cylinder length grows linearly with @xmath60 for increasing @xmath24 , once again a useful and easily understood , result .",
    "it is then an easy matter to compute the volume of the fire cylinder    @xmath61    and thus to obtain the three dimensional number density :    @xmath62    for this selection of very central collisions @xmath63 is found to be @xmath64 particles per @xmath65 , depending on the specific choices for nuclear radius and @xmath16 in figure [ fig : sigma ] .",
    "this leads to an average resonance size of @xmath66 fm .",
    "of course , in the simulation we treat the generic scatterers as points and their extracted size is simply a statement of the volume each resonance occupies , more or less at the time it is created .",
    "it is , however , significant that such a size is eminently reasonable for a hadronic resonance , and that the associated number density is consequently relatively low .",
    "these averages obtain of course after the formation time @xmath16 in the rest frame of produced mesons , but considerably later in say the c. of m. nevertheless , to use an earlier , ` average ' time would also involve less produced particles , and the fire cylinder densities we introduce would be little influenced .",
    "one can also estimate the transverse energy densities , @xmath67 , associated with the above number density @xmath68 .",
    "considering , for now , only the dominant bosonic contribution , one arrives at a total @xmath69 gev _ i.  e.  _",
    "@xmath70 gev/ @xmath65 .",
    "this since the average bosonic mass is somewhat over @xmath71 gev and its average @xmath4 in phase i is somewhat under @xmath71 gev / c . to this",
    "must be added the energy density from baryons present at the initiation of phase ii , an increase within the fire cylinder imagined above of some @xmath72% ; thus overall @xmath73 gev/@xmath74 .",
    "the density @xmath75 is an average over many events constructed at the start of phase ii , and is well below the average bjorken value quoted by the rhic experimental collaborations .",
    "almost independent of collider energy , a major proportion , some @xmath76 of the final mesons , and hence also a large fraction of the transverse energy , is produced via the collisions taking place in phase ii @xcite of the simulation .",
    "the variation in this fraction is only a few percent from @xmath77 to @xmath1 gev / a . combining the contributions from i and",
    "ii would yield @xmath78 gev @xmath74 , still short of the bjorken estimate .",
    "part of this discrepancy in total transverse energy densities is explained by our use of a longer formation time .",
    "however , since the final phase of the cascade occurs when the system has surely expanded considerably spatially , the extra transverse energy generated in ii contributes little to the early density , often used as a trip wire in theoretical models for the initiation of ` plasma ' creation .",
    "the question of detailed double differential cross - sections , @xmath79 , especially those at the highest transverse momenta measured , will be examined thoroughly in ensuing work . for",
    "now we present in figure [ fig : highpt ] a preliminary comparison between star data @xcite and lucifer , pertaining to total negative hadron ( @xmath80 ) production below @xmath81 .",
    "the higher ranges of this comparison , say @xmath82 gev , are possibly beyond the limits of our current modeling which largely omitted hard processes in the underlying two body scattering .",
    "large @xmath4 events certainly require more study , but the present results are nevertheless interesting .",
    "the highest @xmath4 particles are produced in the simulation by multiple scattering and are thus subject to normal energy losses expected in such scattering . despite this reservation ,",
    "the rapid drop in @xmath83 assures one that the softer part of the spectrum dominates total transverse energy production .",
    "thus the total transverse energy @xmath84 generated in the cascade is close to that seen experimentally .",
    "of course we can not really say what transpires in the earliest stages of the ion collision .",
    "we have made certain assumptions about hadron tenacity and saturation and have then obtained at the close of the second stage of the cascade conditions very much like those observed for the global , inclusive , production processes .",
    "one problem , mentioned in the introduction , concerns the earliest phase of the collision , perhaps even before the production of bosonic resonances , and involves the purely baryonic densities .",
    "if one assumes each nucleus is never less than @xmath71 fm in transverse extent , then for @xmath85 fm collisions the baryon density does not rise much above one per @xmath65 .",
    "further , the successful use of generic resonances to describe the cascading might simply reflect a correct fixing of average cross - sections and cross - section ` flow ' during an ion - ion event .",
    "the two phases of the lucifer simulation have been merged into a single , idealized , dynamical model .",
    "such a model can be only a part of the complete story , of course ; partonic degrees of freedom do exist and for sufficiently high particle transverse momentum presumably will dominate the inclusive spectra .",
    "nevertheless , in our approach centrality and energy dependence comparisons between data and simulation are understood as arising from a common physical origin : the uniform and unvarying density of resonances in the fire cylinder .",
    "the constancy of areal and volume densities of bosonic resonances and their close to linear dependence in energy with @xmath60 are notable results of the simulation .",
    "the dynamics of the collision is split into two phases , sequential in time : one could have created the initial conditions for phase ii in some alternate fashion , for example by attributing the initial meson distributions to a string model or to de - confinement and hadronisation of partons @xcite .",
    "our sole and central point here is , then , that signals other than those so far observed should show up to distinguish the present cascade from such alternatives , especially from nearly complete parton de - confinement .",
    "the string approach may in fact lead to the same results in simulating a massive ion - ion collision .",
    "we reiterate that the two - body modeling and cascading in phase i leaves strong footprints in the final results , especially in the surprisingly gentle increase in predicted , and measured , @xmath86 seen from @xmath12 to @xmath1 gev .",
    "no one can doubt that there is a saturation effect observed in meson production at rhic . to produce this effect , we reduce cascading in two fashions : ( 1 ) through the very presence of the boson resonances which eventually decay , over both phases i and ii , into many more @xmath7 or @xmath87 mesons ( @xmath88@xmath89 ) , and ( 2 ) through the near constant resonance density in the fire cylinder achieved in central collisions .",
    "this latter can be imposed in principle via , and is equivalent to , placing a no spatial overlap constraint on the produced resonances prior to the soft cascade .",
    "the data , figure [ fig : dndetacentral ] , suggest a more strict uniformity than produced in the cascade .    in any case , the relatively small observed total multiplicities , which present a problem for all models , do not strongly support a large increase in the number of degrees of freedom in the early phase of au + au collisions at rhic .",
    "one should add that no attempt was made here to divide the output of the cascade into separate dependences on numbers of participants or on the numbers of binary collisions .",
    "the cascade does this dynamically and seamlessly .",
    "one might note , however , that the participant number directly determines the overall incoming energy put into an ion collision in phase i and thus also fixes the number of resonances at reinitialisation and commencement of phase ii .",
    "the division into two phases does , however , distinguish the present approach from some alternatives ; principally in reducing the generation of transverse energy at very early times .",
    "we will return in later work to more specific questions , _",
    "e.  g. _  of flavour generation and high transverse momentum spectra , but we mention here that close to the correct ratios of strange meson production at mid rapidity , are obtained in the calculations .",
    "these contribute some @xmath10% of the particle number there .",
    "this work addresses only gross , inclusive features of existing rhic data .",
    "accordingly , the results only suggest that non - standard medium effects must be looked for in more exclusive , rare events , whose analysis we all await . places to look might include still higher transverse momenta spectra , direct @xmath90-rays , @xmath91 and @xmath92 pairs , or possibly just a sampling of events containing unusually high multiplicity fluctuations .",
