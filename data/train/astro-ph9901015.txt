    "to explain the discrepancy between the observed flux of solar neutrinos and the predicted emission rate it has been postulated that the neutrinos have two or three different mass states , and that these mass states are different from the flavor states  @xcite .",
    "this extension of the standard electroweak theory leads to oscillations between the electron neutrino and the different neutrino species . a key role in the solution of the solar neutrino problem",
    "is played by the msw theory  @xcite . in this theory",
    "there is a spherical resonance region at the radius @xmath1 .",
    "we denote the region inside the resonance radius , @xmath2 , as _",
    "region  i _ and the region outside the resonance radius , @xmath3 , as _ region  ii _ ( see fig  [ figure_paths ] ) .",
    "hereafter , we suppose the solar core to be inside region  i ( i.  e.  inside the resonance radius @xmath4 . in this case",
    "all neutrinos are emitted in region  i and they cross the resonance region once to enter region  ii on their way to the earth ( as shown in fig  [ figure_paths ] ) .",
    "the other situation , when the resonance region in inside the solar core , so that neutrinos emitted in region  ii cross the resonance twice or not at all , presents complications in notations rather than in physics , and it is discussed in appendix  a.    in our paper , we consider the case of two types of neutrino flavors and correspondingly of two types of neutrino mass states . in this case for each neutrino energy there are two orthogonal wkb solutions of dirac equation out of the resonance region , which we denote as @xmath5 _ and _ @xmath6 _ neutrino states_. these neutrino states exist in regions  i and  ii , where the wkb approximation is valid , and they coincide with neutrino pure mass states in the vacuum , but they are not given for the resonance region , where the wkb approximation breaks down .    in the adiabatic approximation",
    "the @xmath5 neutrino states are connected to each other as well as the @xmath6 states are connected .",
    "so , we say that there are two _ neutrino paths _ :",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 [ for example , the @xmath7 path means that the neutrino is emitted in region  i as the @xmath5 state and is converted , while crossing the resonance , into the @xmath5 state in region  ii ] .",
    "however , if the adiabatic approximation breaks down , then the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states jump one into another at the resonance radius . as a result , in this case there are four neutrino paths : @xmath7 , @xmath9 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 ( see fig  [ figure_paths ] ) . due to electron scattering and nonzero neutrino masses",
    "these neutrino paths gain different quantum mechanical phases during the propagation to the earth and hence interfere with each other .",
    "there are _ two neutrino eigenfunctions for each neutrino energy _ , which are solutions of dirac equation in the entire region of space ( including the resonance region , where the wkb approximation is not valid ) .",
    "it is convenient to choose them so that they coincide with the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states in region  i ( where neutrinos are emitted ) . in region",
    "ii ( after the resonance crossing ) the eigenfunctions are sums of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 states , whose coefficients are determined by resonance jump formulas  ( [ nonadiabatic_eigenfunctions])([jump_amplitude ] ) [ see fig  [ figure_paths ] ] . for this choice",
    "the entire eigenfunctions are orthogonal .",
    "each neutrino propagating to the earth with a given energy can be represented as a linear combination of two eigenfunctions or as a linear combination of four neutrino paths ( with only two independent coefficients and all others related to the jump formulas ) .",
    "for example , in the adiabatic approximation there is no jump , so , there are only two paths , the @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the two eigenfunctions correspond to these two paths ( out of the resonance region ) .",
    "the msw effect results in a reduction of the average number of detected electron neutrinos  @xcite and also produces time variations of the neutrino flux .",
    "the time variations of the detected neutrino flux are due to interference between different neutrino paths and are sensitive to the neutrino masses and the mixing angle .",
    "there are several physical effects that can destroy the coherence between neutrino paths and limit the observability of flux time variations .",
    "the most significant effect is an averaging of the observed neutrino flux over the effective detected energy band @xmath11 .",
    "this averaging wipes out a cross term between two neutrino paths if @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the difference of propagation times of these paths . for a neutrino line ,",
    "@xmath11 is simply the energy width of the line , @xmath14 ( thermal broadening effect ) . in the case of a detection of the continuous neutrino energy spectrum the energy response function of our detection device",
    "must be sufficiently narrow if one wants to observe flux time variations .    a second effect , which can destroy coherence , and which is equally important , is the averaging of the detected neutrino flux over the region of neutrino emission inside the sun .",
    "this effect depends on the electron density in a region of the solar core and it is important even for the case of very small neutrino masses ( see sec .",
    "[ averaging_over_position ] ) . as we will see below",
    ", the averaging over the position of neutrino emission greatly simplifies all calculations because only two cross terms between four neutrino paths survive .",
    "( actually one of these cross terms is much larger than another , so there is only one potentially important cross term !",
    "this cross term varies with the motion of the earth and therefore it gives time variations of the detected neutrino flux . )    a third effect that can potentially average out time variations of the neutrino flux is collisional decoherence .",
    "electric forces acting on the emitting nucleus from its neighbors lead to a negligible stark effect on a nuclear scale but they also lead to the acceleration of the nucleus .",
    "the collisional decoherence was first discussed by nussinov in @xmath15  @xcite , who used a coherence criterion @xmath16 with @xmath17 approximately equal to the electric potential due to neighboring ions . for the @xmath18 @xmath19be neutrino line nussinov got @xmath20 , although the theoretical basis is uncertain . in @xmath21 krauss and wilczek",
    "@xcite suggested the plasma full collision time as an approximate value of the coherence time .",
    "they got @xmath22 .",
    "as we will see , this is a considerable overestimate for the coherence time .",
    "more recently , loeb  @xcite considered a collisional doppler spectral broadening @xmath23 .",
    "loeb obtained a criterion @xmath24 , where @xmath25 was the harmonically averaged nuclear acceleration and @xmath26 was the collision frequency .",
    "loeb s coherence time for the @xmath18 @xmath19be neutrino line was @xmath27 .    because of the uncertainty in these estimates of the criterion for the collisional decoherence , we felt a more detailed analysis was desirable . in this paper",
    "we carry out such an analysis and derive the correct collisional decoherence criterion .",
    "it turns out that nussinov s and loeb s estimates are close to this criterion if the acceleration they used is replaced by the holtsmark acceleration .    in most of the previous papers",
    "the behavior of the neutrinos is treated as a one - dimensional problem , where a constant neutrino energy is assumed and the evolution of the neutrino in space ( or equivalently in time ) is followed as it propagates to the earth . the neutrino is assumed to be emitted into a single state in the high density solar core .",
    "it propagates to the resonant region where it nonadiabatically splits into two states .",
    "these two propagate with different momenta to the earth , and at the detector on the earth these two states can interfere according to the accumulated phase difference during this latter propagation .",
    "this procedure is adequate for treating the decoherence due to the energy averaging .",
    "however , it is not adequate to properly treat the collisional decoherence of the neutrino flux time variations , since the neutrino emitting nucleus moves erratically in time ( suffering random accelerations in different directions ) .",
    "thus , the positions and the velocities of the nucleus are different at different neutrino emission times .",
    "these emission times have to be properly defined and evaluated . to do this",
    ", both space and time must be introduced into the problem .    in our calculations",
    "we follow the prescription of fermi .",
    "we assume two definite spatial eigenfunctions for each neutrino energy ( because we assume two neutrino flavors ) .",
    "we then expand the neutrino wavefunction in terms of these eigenfunctions .",
    "the components of this expansion are functions of time alone , as the neutrino is emitted by the moving nucleus .",
    "the components themselves have probability distributions , and after second quantization these distributions are , in turn , expanded into two oscillator states corresponding to occupation or non - occupation of the neutrino eigenfunctions . finally , the differential equations in @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the time evolution ( during emission ) of the coefficients @xmath30 of the latter expansion ( i.  e.  of the oscillator occupation amplitudes ) are derived and integrated .    for a neutrino line",
    "the decaying nucleus emits a neutrino with the fixed energy in the frame co - moving with the nucleus . by integrating the differential equations one finds that each of oscillator occupation amplitudes @xmath30 is an integral over a time parameter @xmath31 corresponding to `` the time of emission '' .",
    "then we sum over excited oscillator states by integration over a spread of neutrino energies @xmath32 in the laboratory frame and summing over @xmath33 indices ( the summing over @xmath33 is actually the summing over two eigenfunctions for each energy , which coincide with the @xmath5 and @xmath6 adiabatic states at the position of emission ) .",
    "thus , the emitted neutrino wavefunction is a double integral over @xmath31 and @xmath32 and , of course , a function of @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "because of the rapidly changing phase the integrands in this double integral vary rapidly with @xmath31 and @xmath32 . for a given time and position of detection @xmath28 and @xmath34 , the main contribution to the integral comes from isolated values for @xmath31 and @xmath32 where the phase is stationary .",
    "as one would expect , these values coincide with the solutions of the causality and doppler shift equations for the emission time @xmath31 and the emitted neutrino energy @xmath32 .",
    "the method of stationary phase selects these solutions and also gives the neutrino phase .",
    "let us , for simplicity , consider that the neutrino is emitted into only one of two neutrino eigenfunctions , for example , into the one that coincides with the @xmath6 state in region  i ( as in case of high electron density in the solar core ) .",
    "then , in region  ii this eigenfunction is given by the sum of @xmath6 and @xmath5 states due to nonadiabatic resonance crossing .",
    "in other words , the entire eigenfunction is the mixture of two neutrino paths @xmath8 and @xmath10 out of the spherical resonance region ( i.  e.  in regions  i and  ii ) .",
    "these two neutrino paths have the same momenta @xmath35 in region  i but different momenta @xmath35 and @xmath36 in region  ii [ @xmath37 , see eqs  ( [ k_prime_definition ] ) and  ( [ k_prime ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , for a given time and position of the detection , one finds two solutions for @xmath31 and @xmath32 from the method of stationary phase , which correspond to the two different propagation times of the two neutrino paths .",
    "we can say that the eigenfunction is emitted twice : first the @xmath8 path contributes , then the @xmath10 path contributes .",
    "the two different values of the emission time @xmath31 are determined as the two retarded times .",
    "the corresponding two different values of the neutrino energy @xmath32 are found to be the two doppler - shifted energies , since the emitting nucleus has two different velocities at the two emission times due to its acceleration . in terms of these parameters , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ,",
    "the relative phase of the two neutrino paths ( i.  e.  of the two solutions for the emission of the eigenfunction ) can be found and the amount of interference between them can be determined .",
    "then we have to average over the distribution of nuclear accelerations , since we detect many emitting nuclei and integrate over a large interval of detection time . only in this way",
    "can we correctly determine the decoherence produced by collisions .",
    "the resulting decoherence depends on neutrino masses and the mixing angle .",
    "for the continuous neutrino spectrum one needs to appreciate that an electron is emitted as well as a neutrino . to carry out the problem in this case one , first , fixes the state into which the electron is emitted and then treats the neutrino emission as in the case of neutrino line emission .",
    "however , at the end a sum over electron states must be taken .",
    "this introduces some further complications .",
    "for example , the two neutrino paths have different energies , so if the energy band width of the detector is too narrow , the detector will be affected only by that one of these neutrino paths which has its energy inside the detector band , and the other path will be outside this energy band .",
    "thus , no interference can occur . in the case of the continuous neutrino spectrum detection both collisional decoherence and averaging over the neutrino energy",
    "must be treated simultaneously .    in this paper",
    "we present a complete self - consistent analysis ( making use of the method of stationary phase ) of the time variations of the detected neutrino flux due to interference effects .",
    "we consider a general nonadiabatic theory for two neutrino flavors .",
    "we neglect spherical geometry of the problem and use jump formulas derived under the assumption that the solar electron density varies exponentially with the radius throughout the resonance region .",
    "we make use of the last assumption only for our final numerical results .",
    "another assumption that we make is that of constant nuclear acceleration , i.e.  the acceleration of the emitting nucleus is considered constant during the delay time @xmath13 between propagations of different neutrino paths .",
    "however , the nuclear acceleration has random direction .",
    "we use a holtsmark distribution for the absolute value of the instantaneous nuclear acceleration  @xcite .",
    "the assumption of constant nuclear acceleration turns out to be sufficient for our purposes , i.e.  it is valid for all relevant cases in which time variations of the detected neutrino flux are significant .    in the second section we use the wkb approximation to solve the dirac equation in the mass state representation and to derive formulas for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 neutrino states .",
