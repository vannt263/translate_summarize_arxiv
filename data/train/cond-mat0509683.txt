    "a variety of metal surfaces , such as the ( 111 ) surfaces of the noble metals , are known to support a partially occupied band of shockley surface states with energies near the fermi level,@xcite whose dynamics have been the subject of long - standing interest . @xcite in particular , the lifetimes of excited holes at the band edge ( @xmath1 ) of these surface states have been investigated with high resolution angle - resolved photoemission ( arp)@xcite and with the use of the scanning tunneling microscope ( stm).@xcite stm techniques have also allowed the determination of the lifetimes of excited shockley and image electrons over a range of energies above the fermi level .",
    "@xcite      many - body calculations of the electron - electron ( e - e ) inelastic lifetimes of excited holes at the surface - state band edge of the ( 111 ) surfaces of the noble metals cu , ag , and au , which were based upon the @xmath6 one - dimensional scheme that had been introduced by chulkov _",

    "let us consider a semi - infinite many - electron system that is translationally invariant in the plane of the surface ( normal to the @xmath8 axis ) .",
    "the decay rate or inverse lifetime of a quasiparticle ( electron or hole ) that has been added to the system in the single - particle state @xmath9 of energy @xmath10 is obtained as follows ( we use atomic units , i.e. , @xmath11)@xcite @xmath12 where the @xmath13 sign in front of the integral should be taken to be minus or plus depending on whether the quasiparticle is an electron ( @xmath14 ) or a hole ( @xmath15 ) , respectively , @xmath16 is the fermi energy , @xmath17 and @xmath18 represent the position and wave vectors in the plane of the surface , and @xmath19 is the nonlocal self - energy operator .",

    "the difference between our predicted surface - state lifetime broadening of @xmath64 and that reported before ( @xmath65)@xcite is entirely due to our more accurate description of ( i ) the projected band structure and ( ii ) the wave - vector dependence of the surface - state wave functions @xmath66 entering the evaluation of the green function of eq .",
