    "800  nm , and repetition rate 100  khz were focused 400  m below the surface using a 40@xmath52 microscope objective and translated at 75  mm / min ( for waveguides other than 4 ) .",
    "permanent index changes result in the focus , yielding elliptical , vertically oriented , single - mode waveguides with modes approximately @xmath53  m in size at 800  nm .",
    "waveguide 3 and the sink waveguides are in a plane parallel to the surface , while angles of 120 between this plane and the other system waveguides minimise non - neighbour coupling .",
    "because couplings between elliptical waveguides are dependent on angular orientation  @xcite , we determined the couplings by writing pairs of waveguides oriented at the specified angles .",
    "couplings as a function of separation were determined by writing the pairs at different separations and measuring the output intensities after a known propagation length when only one is optically excited .",
    "the final waveguide separations were chosen to ensure that the tight - binding approximation is maintained , that @xmath34 can be matched by @xmath51 , that @xmath54 , and that the number of sink modes remains manageable .",
    "the system - sink population transfer can be modelled as a constant effective rate  @xcite @xmath55 if @xmath56 . in our case , although @xmath57 meant that the decay was not perfectly exponential , it was nevertheless effectively irreversible , considering that sufficiently many sink modes were present to prevent reflection from the far end and back into the main waveguides .    for waveguide 4 , the writing translation speed was decreased to increase the propagation constant . in a pair of waveguides with mismatched propagation constants ,",
    "the maximum power transfer depends only on the ratio @xmath58 .",
    "we used this fact to determine the translation speed decrease necessary to set @xmath59 at 800  nm . due to the measurement uncertainty ( about @xmath60 ) and day - to - day variability in the waveguide writing process",

    "<S> transport phenomena on a quantum scale appear in a variety of systems , ranging from photosynthetic complexes to engineered quantum devices . </S>",
    "<S> it has been predicted that the efficiency of quantum transport can be enhanced through dynamic interaction between the system and a noisy environment . </S>",
    "<S> we report the first experimental demonstration of such environment - assisted quantum transport , using an engineered network of laser - written waveguides , with relative energies and inter - waveguide couplings tailored to yield the desired hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> controllable decoherence is simulated via broadening the bandwidth of the input illumination , yielding a significant increase in transport efficiency relative to the narrowband case . </S>",
    "<S> we show integrated optics to be suitable for simulating specific target hamiltonians as well as open quantum systems with controllable loss and decoherence .    </S>",
    "<S> recent research into photosynthetic antenna complexes has shown evidence of coherence in excitonic energy transport  @xcite , despite the noisy cellular environment in which such complexes are found . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , environmental decoherence has been credited with increasing the efficiency of transport through these systems , an effect known as environment - assisted quantum transport ( enaqt )  @xcite or dephasing - assisted transport  @xcite . while enaqt has been the subject of many theoretical studies  whether in the photosynthetic context  @xcite or in other nanoscale transport systems  @xcite  and despite its potential for improving transport in artificial quantum systems , it has so far never been directly observed .    </S>",
    "<S> we use an integrated photonic simulator to demonstrate the first implementation of enaqt . </S>",
    "<S> our simulator was fabricated using femtosecond - laser direct writing , which allows waveguides to be drawn directly into glass using a focused pulsed laser . </S>",
    "<S> this permits the creation of three - dimensional waveguide arrays , as well as precision and repeatability in engineering interactions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we used control over the wavelength and bandwidth of the guided light to simulate effective decoherence , thereby enhancing transport efficiency .        </S>",
    "<S> we consider a single excitation on a network of @xmath0 coupled sites , governed by a tight - binding hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the excitation being localised at site @xmath3 , @xmath4 the energy of that site , and @xmath5 the coupling between sites @xmath3 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> although enaqt can occur on an ordered lattice where all the energies @xmath4 are equal  @xcite , transport enhancement was first explained in disordered systems , which we consider here .    </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the efficiency of transport from a particular initial site to a particular target site , where the excitation is trapped . in the case of a photosynthetic complex ( figure  [ fig : enaqt]a ) </S>",
    "<S> , trapping describes the transfer of excitons to a reaction center , where they drive charge separation . </S>",
    "<S> it can be modelled as irreversible coupling of the target site to a sink at rate @xmath7 ( figure  [ fig : enaqt]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency is then the probability of finding the exciton in the sink after some particular time .    </S>",
    "<S> enaqt occurs when decoherence increases the trapping probability over the fully coherent case . </S>",
    "<S> decoherence results from coupling of a quantum system to inaccessible degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in photosynthetic antenna complexes , the energies of chromophores are coupled to molecular vibrations ; tracing out this environment results in decoherence in the excitonic subspace .    in the absence of decoherence </S>",
    "<S> , energetic disorder tends to localise the wavepacket through processes such as destructive interference or anderson localisation  @xcite , thus preventing it from reaching the target . </S>",
    "<S> since these are coherent processes , they are diminished by decoherence , possibly resulting in enhancement of transport efficiency to the target site . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative but ultimately equivalent view of enaqt is that eigenstates of @xmath8 are stationary , making it difficult to reach the target if the initial and target sites differ in energy . </S>",
    "<S> incoherent processes , however , permit transitions between the eigenstates of @xmath8 , yielding greater mobility .    the first theoretical explorations of enaqt focused on the case where the decoherence takes the form of site - independent , markovian , pure dephasing  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the decoherence in our simulation is neither site - based nor markovian , this is not an obstacle to enaqt ;  @xcite transport efficiency can be enhanced as long as the decoherence allows population transfer between otherwise - stationary eigenstates .    </S>",
    "<S> we simulate enaqt in an array of coupled single - mode optical waveguides obeying the equation  @xcite @xmath9 where the light is propagating in the @xmath10-direction , @xmath11 is a creation operator for a photon in waveguide @xmath3 at position @xmath10 , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the propagation constants of the waveguides and the couplings between them . </S>",
    "<S> the former are determined by the waveguides refractive index profiles , while the latter also depend on the separations between them . </S>",
    "<S> light propagation governed by this schrdinger - like equation directly simulates evolution under @xmath8 , with @xmath13 replacing @xmath5 and the @xmath12 replacing @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus simulate different hamiltonians by controlling the number , position , and refractive indices of the waveguides .    </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic stability of laser - written waveguide arrays renders decoherence challenging to simulate . </S>",
    "<S> one approach is to stochastically modulate the index of refraction along each waveguide  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though every realization with a particular longitudinal index profile will be fully coherent , decoherence can be simulated by averaging over the recorded optical outputs from many realizations in post - processing . </S>",
    "<S> this approach was recently used to simulate decoherence - enhanced navigation of a maze  @xcite .    by contrast , we simulate decoherence by averaging over the results from a single array illuminated with many optical wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> although each individual wavelength propagates through the waveguide array coherently , decoherence can be achieved using broadband illumination and a single output intensity measurement which does not resolve wavelength . in other words , the wavelength degree of freedom </S>",
    "<S> is traced out yielding a partially mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> similar approaches are well established in optics , where for instance thick birefringent quartz plates followed by wavelength - insensitive measurements have been used to decohere the polarization states of single photons  @xcite .        as an example of our approach to simulating decoherence </S>",
    "<S> , we consider two uncoupled waveguides @xmath14 and @xmath15 that have a difference @xmath16 in their propagation constants at a wavelength @xmath17 . as light propagates along the waveguides </S>",
    "<S> , it will accumulate a phase difference @xmath18 between them . </S>",
    "<S> broadband illumination can then be seen to cause effective decoherence on a length scale comparable to the illumination coherence length : any initial coherence @xmath19 between the waveguides will decay : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the normalised first - order temporal correlation function of the light , which  being proportional to the fourier transform of the spectrum  </S>",
    "<S> decays to zero faster for spectrally broader illumination . </S>",
    "<S> the strength @xmath22 of the decoherence can be quantified as the inverse of the optical coherence length , @xmath23 , and is usually proportional to the fwhm bandwidth @xmath24 . for a uniform distribution centered at @xmath17 , @xmath25    in the case of coupled waveguides </S>",
    "<S> , wavelength dependence affects couplings in addition to the propagation constants . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting decoherence will therefore not only have characteristics of pure dephasing ( as in equation  ) , but will also include off - diagonal terms . </S>",
    "<S> however , this kind of decoherence can also result in enaqt . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the off - diagonal terms imply that our decoherence could , in principle , be used to simulate enaqt in ordered systems  @xcite , but the effect would be weaker because of the absence of the pure - dephasing contribution .    for our simulation we chose a network of four waveguide sites  arranged as in figure  [ fig : enaqt]c  because it is one of the smallest systems in which enaqt is possible and because it can give significant enhancements even with relatively weak decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> waveguide 1 was the input , waveguide 3 the target , and the sink consisted of a long linear array of tightly coupled waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling between waveguides in this sink was significantly higher than between the four main waveguides , so that any light entering the sink from waveguide 3 was largely transported away  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sink need only be long enough to prevent light reflected from the far end from returning into the main simulation waveguides .    </S>",
    "<S> we need to choose propagation constants and separations among the four main waveguides in order to best approximate this hamiltonian : @xmath26 where all parameters depend on the wavelength @xmath27 of the input light . due to their wide separations , </S>",
    "<S> couplings between non - neighbouring sites are negligible ( @xmath28 of neighbouring - site couplings ) . </S>",
    "<S> our simulator is designed so that , at our central simulation wavelength @xmath17 , @xmath29 in this case , one of the eigenstates of @xmath8 has no support on site 3 , @xmath30 , while the remaining three eigenstates all have substantial support on site 3 . </S>",
    "<S> because @xmath31 can not couple to the sink  at least at @xmath17the maximum trapping efficiency at infinite time is @xmath32 .    considering the wavelength dependence of @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> provides a different way to see the decohering effects of broadband illumination . due to </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of @xmath33 and @xmath34 on the wavelength , equation   only holds at a particular wavelength @xmath17 . at other wavelengths </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath31 will have some support on waveguide 3 and thus be able to couple to the sink , increasing the efficiency above @xmath35 , as shown in figure  [ fig : enaqt]d . </S>",
    "<S> unlike in other examples of enaqt  @xcite , the efficiency increases monotonically with the strength of decoherence , meaning there is no optimal level of decoherence in this model .    based on measurements of couplings and propagation constants in isolated pairs of waveguides ( see methods ) </S>",
    "<S> , we selected the following design parameters : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 ( see figure  [ fig : enaqt]c ) . figure  [ fig : setup]a shows numerical modelling of light propagation given these parameters . although these were designed for a center wavelength of 800  nm , variations in the implementation of the waveguide parameters resulted in equation  [ eqn : condition ] being satisfied at @xmath39  nm .    we measured the efficiency using narrowband light ( less than 1  nm bandwidth and always horizontally polarised for consistency ) from a tuneable ti : sapphire laser ( spectra - physics tsunami ) in quasi - cw mode ( figure  [ fig : setup]b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the output was imaged using a custom - built @xmath40 magnifying telescope and the optical power was measured using a large - area power - meter after isolating either the system or sink waveguides using a variable slit . </S>",
    "<S> examples of the output distribution are given in figure  [ fig : setup]c , showing the significant difference between illumination at @xmath17 and an off - center wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : results]a shows the measured efficiency ( fraction of light output in the sink modes ) for wavelengths ranging from 745 to 835  nm .        </S>",
    "<S> enaqt  shown in figure  [ fig : results]b  is the average enhancement in efficiency over the spectral band of interest , relative to the efficiency at @xmath17 , @xmath41 where the average @xmath42 over @xmath27 is taken over the top - hat distribution on @xmath43 . as predicted </S>",
    "<S> , it is an increasing function of the bandwidth , i.e. , of the decoherence strength @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the highest enaqt observed was @xmath44 at a bandwidth of @xmath45  nm . </S>",
    "<S> we thus demonstrated that coherent transport in a coupled , statically disordered system can be enhanced through decoherence .    the theoretical prediction in figure  [ fig : results]b contains no free parameters . it is a simulation of the dynamics under the simulated hamiltonian @xmath8 , together with trapping from site 3 at the rate @xmath7 discussed in methods and pure dephasing between waveguide @xmath46 and the other three waveguides at rate @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the disagreement between theory and experiment is small considering the number of possible contributing factors . </S>",
    "<S> these include the off - diagonal decoherence when the waveguides are coupled , the fact that the trapping is not perfectly exponential , errors in the measurements of the coupling constants , optical losses , and error in satisfying equation  [ eqn : condition ] . as an example , the shaded band in figure  [ fig : results]b represents the error that would arise if @xmath47 deviated from @xmath48 by up to 10% .    in our experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of enaqt was limited by the maximum achievable decoherence , which at @xmath49  @xmath50 was small compared to the inverse of the propagation length . </S>",
    "<S> we were limited by two components of equation : the tunability of our laser limited @xmath24 , while @xmath51 was limited ( via equation ) by the need to keep @xmath34 small enough to stay in the tight - binding approximation . </S>",
    "<S> these are not fundamental limitations , and future improvements that increase @xmath22 would result in significantly larger transport enhancement ; as shown in figure  [ fig : enaqt]d , the transport efficiency of this model can get arbitrarily close to 1 for sufficiently long propagation distances and decoherence strengths . </S>",
    "<S> stronger decoherence would also allow enaqt to be observed in networks that are less sensitive to decoherence than our model .    </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that integrated photonics are well - suited for simulating open quantum systems , capable of implementing a disordered target hamiltonian with controllable loss . </S>",
    "<S> the technique of using broadband excitation to introduce tuneable levels of decoherence ensures that photonics can simulate open quantum systems ; previously , low intrinsic noise in photonic devices rendered decoherence difficult to realize in integrated optics , particularly without averaging over results from many different device realizations . </S>",
    "<S> our approach will not only improve the controllability of photonic quantum simulation , but also aid in the experimental optimisation of transport in other engineered quantum systems . </S>"
