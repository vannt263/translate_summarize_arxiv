    "being at first unaware of agoh and dilcher s result , we independently proved .",
    "this was fortunate , since our method of proof actually implies a stronger result that does not follow from the methods of @xcite , and gives hints of a deeper theory at play .",

    "remarkably , we will show that the relation identifying the `` trivial zeros '' @xmath111 of @xmath36 is equivalent to that identity .",
    "it was precisely our study of the values @xmath112 which prompted the discovery of as a numerical observation for small values of @xmath1 .",

    "let us comment on the connection to the theory of modular forms .",
    "for @xmath113 , let @xmath114 denote the vector space of modular forms of weight @xmath100 for the modular group @xmath115 .",

    "the remainder of the paper is organized in roughly three parts : the first part consists of section  [ sec : bernoulli ] and [ sec : eisenstein ] , in which we give a new proof of the summation identity , and then show how a modification of our argument yields a proof of theorem  [ thm : eisenstein ] .",
    "our method is an extension of an algebraic technique introduced by zagier @xcite , that enables us to reduce the identities to a family of more conventional binomial summation identities .",
    "these identities are proved using zeilberger s algorithm and the method of wilf - zeilberger pairs .    in the second part of the paper , comprising sections  [ sec : wzeta ] and [ sec : wzeta2 ] , we study the properties of the function @xmath36 , and prove theorems  [ thm : analytic - continuation ] , [ thm : wzeta - specialvalues ] , and [ thm : wzeta - deriv0 ] .",
    "the analysis relies heavily on an integral representation for @xmath36 derived by matsumoto @xcite .",
    "in the final part , which consists of sections  [ sec : asym - genfuns][sec : proof - su3-asym ] , we apply the results concerning @xmath36 to the study of the asymptotic behavior of the sequence @xmath11 .",
    "we combine mellin transform methods with a saddle point analysis ( framed in probabilistic language as a local central limit theorem ) , culminating in the proof of theorem  [ thm : su3-asym ] .",
    "a key number - theoretic difficulty we encounter in the course of the proof is that of proving effective bounds for the decay of a certain generating function away from the saddle point ; we derive the necessary bounds by using the modular transformation properties of the jacobi theta functions .",
    "we conclude with some final comments and open problems in section  [ sec : final - comments ] .",
    "a few of the proofs in the paper involve tedious computations of a purely algebraic nature , which can be checked by hand without much difficulty but are most easily verified using a computer algebra package .",

    "then the summation above can also be written , in analogy with  , as @xmath243\\scriptstyle r , s \\in \\lambda_+(z ) \\\\[-5pt ] \\scriptstyle r \\succ s \\end{array } } - \\sum_{\\begin{array}{c } \\\\[-17pt]\\scriptstyle r , s \\in \\lambda_+(z ) \\\\[-5pt ] \\scriptstyle s \\succ r \\end{array } } \\bigg ) f_n(r , s ) = \\sum_{r \\in \\lambda_+(z)}^\\infty f_n(r , r ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{2n+1 } \\alpha_{n , j } \\right ) \\frac{g_{6n+2}(z)}{2 }   = \\frac{g_{6n+2}(z)}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus we obtain precisely the identity , proving theorem  [ thm : eisenstein ] .    in connection with the proof above",
    ", we remark that zagier s observation about the lifting of summation relations to eisenstein series was made in the context of considering general summation relations of the form @xmath244 expressing a given eisenstein series in terms of the eisenstein series with lower index .",
    "it is apparent from the formula for @xmath245 mentioned in subsection  [ subsec : bernoulli ] that for any fixed @xmath9 there must be a certain number of linearly independent relations of this kind ( the number of such relations increases linearly with @xmath9 ) , and one can use standard algorithms from linear algebra and the theory of modular forms to find all such relations . from this point of view ,",
    "the existence of summation relations of the form again , for specific values of @xmath9is not especially surprising .",
    "what is _ not _ necessarily apparent , and it is not clear to us from the discussion in @xcite whether it was envisioned by zagier , was that his technique can also be used to prove interesting _ families _ of summation relations ( other than the single relatively trivial example discussed in section 1 of his paper ) that hold for many values of @xmath9 and have the kind of elegant structure that our identity possesses .",
    "the discovery that this is in fact the case makes zagier s technique appear a lot more exciting , and opens the way to discovering and proving  possibly in an algorithmic fashion  additional families of identities ; see section  [ sec : final - comments ] for a further brief discussion of these possibilities .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove theorems  [ thm : analytic - continuation ] and [ thm : wzeta - specialvalues ] .",
    "our approach is based to a large extent on an integral representation derived by for the more general dirichlet series @xmath56 defined in ( see equation ( 5.3 ) in @xcite ) .    * the region of convergence : proof of theorem  [ thm : analytic - continuation](1 ) .",
    "* we start by giving a simple argument to prove the claim of theorem  [ thm : analytic - continuation](1 ) about the precise region of convergence of the dirichlet series defining @xmath36 .",
    "observe that @xmath246 here , the series for @xmath247 converges if and only if @xmath248 , and the summation over @xmath249 converges absolutely if and only if the simpler series @xmath250 ( where @xmath251 ) converges absolutely , since on the range of summation the multiplicative factor @xmath252 is bounded between @xmath32 and @xmath186 . it",
    "is now trivial to check that the series in converges absolutely and uniformly on compacts ( which ensures that the sum is a holomorphic function ) if and only if @xmath58 , for example by comparison with the integral @xmath253    [ [ analytic - continuation - proof - of - theoremthmanalytic - continuation2 . ] ] analytic continuation : proof of theorem  [ thm : analytic - continuation](2 ) .",

    "we recall matsumoto s ingenious method to achieve this ( which he applied in a more general context ) , but add a few more details and motivation that are missing from his analysis and that we feel add some important insight in view of our newer discoveries about the significance of @xmath36 .",
    "start with a standard contour integral formula from the class of mellin - barnes integrals ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq .  ( 3.3.9 ) , p.  91 ) , namely @xmath254 where @xmath255 denotes the vertical contour from @xmath256 to @xmath257 ( with @xmath258 , here and throughout ) , and where we assume that @xmath259 $ ] and @xmath260 . setting @xmath261 , multiplying by @xmath262 and summing over @xmath263 gives that @xmath264 provided the infinite summations converge and that the interchange of the summation and integration operations can be justified .",
    "note that the two zeta series within the integrand can be summed precisely when @xmath265 and @xmath266 , that is , when @xmath267 ( where @xmath251 as before ) . together with the constraints @xmath268 , we see that @xmath209 and @xmath269 must satisfy @xmath270 as illustrated in figure  [ fig : sing - diag](a ) , a feasible value of @xmath209 satisfying these constraints exists if and only if @xmath271 , which is consistent with our earlier observations on the region of convergence of the dirichlet series defining @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath271 , and a valid value of @xmath209 is chosen ( for example , the value @xmath272 works ) , the interchange of the summation and integration operations is easy to justify using standard facts about the exponential decay of the gamma function , and the ( at most ) polynomial growth of the zeta function , along vertical lines , namely that for @xmath273 , @xmath274 , we have that latexmath:[\\ ] ] since the discovery was based on the summation technique of sections  [ sec : bernoulli ] and [ sec : eisenstein ] , these identities should arise as specializations of similar identities for the eisenstein series .",
