    "recent advances in molecular biology techniques for the engineering of synthetic networks have made possible the measurement of populations of mrna s and proteins in simple genetic networks .",

    "we show that in this limit the rate equations should be replaced by a master equation . the rate and master equations used in the analysis of genetic networks are closely related to those that describe chemical reaction networks on small grains . in this context , the limit of low copy number is achieved for reaction networks on interstellar dust grains , due to the sub - micron size of the grains and the extremely low flux due to the low density of the interstellar gas .",
