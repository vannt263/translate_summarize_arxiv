    "the quantum correlations are responsible for the effective operation of quantum information devices having the essential advantages in comparison with their classical counterparts @xcite . according to the current stand point",
    ", the total correlations in multi - particle system are described by mutual information and quantum correlations for both pure and mixed states are characterized by the quantum discord @xcite .    studing the quantum correlations , it is important to choose the proper quantum system possessing the desirable properties and realizable in practice . in this regard",
    "we point on the chains of nuclear spins , which are suitable for realization of quantum registers and quantum devices transferring and manipulating the quantum information .",
    "it is challenging that the multiple quantum ( mq ) nmr methods @xcite allow us to construct experimentally the xy - interacting spin chains .",
    "moreover , using the nmr method , it is possible to create conditions providing the concentration of polarization at a single node of the chain ( up to the unavoidable experimental errors ) @xcite .",
    "the dynamic of quantum correlations in this model was first studied in @xcite . moreover , it was shown recently @xcite that such chains are convenient for study of the dependence of the discord on the representation basis of the density matrix describing the state of a quantum system .",
    "thus , the quantum discord calculated for the interacting nuclear spins differs from that between the fermions arising after the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite of the density matrix operator @xcite .",
    "it seemed out that the quantum discord between fermions may exhibit very interesting properties @xcite which have not been observed in the discord between nuclear spins .",
    "the most important property is the stationarity of the pairwise discord in a fermion cluster with the above initial state of a spin-1/2 chain .",
    "besides , if we polarize the proper initial node , then the quantum discord will be the same for any fermion pair in the selected fermion cluster .",
    "apparently , this fact is important for implementation of the fermion registers in the quantum devices because all fermion - nodes are equivalent from the quantum correlation point of view .",
    "the existence of such clusters motivates the study of their stability with respect to both the experimental errors in creation of the single - node polarization and the noise effects .",
    "we note that the stability of the spin dynamics in the presence of different types of noise is an attractive problem , because noise is unavoidable in any quantum process .",
    "in particular , the fidelity of the perfect ( in the absence of noises ) state transfer under noise - perturbations of the coupling constants in the hamiltonian was considered in refs.@xcite for two chains : a completely engineered chain and a chain with remote end - nodes . in both cases ,",
    "the important result is that the noise reduces the fidelity without changing the state transfer time .",
    "in this paper we study the stability of the discord distribution relative to perturbations of the initial state in a homogeneous spin chain ( i.e. the coupling constants in the hamiltonian are assumed to be stable ) .",
    "we show that the stationarity of the quantum discord in the system with the single initially polarized node may not be destroyed by the additional low polarizations of the neighboring nodes which unavoidably appear in the experiment .",
    "this perturbation just leads to the deformation of the pairwise quantum discord and may eventually destroy the clusters of fermions with the equal pairwise discord .",
    "the threshold value of the low - polarization is found .",
    "we also consider the deformation of the stationary discord distribution caused by the noise - polarization appearing in all nodes of the spin chain .",
    "it is remarkable that the discord stationarity is not disturbed in both cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the jordan - wigner transformation of the @xmath0-hamiltonian with nearest neighbor interactions is briefly discussed in sec.[section : jw ] .",
    "the stability of the pairwise discord stationarity in the jordan - wigner fermion system of a spin-1/2 chain with single initially polarized node under perturbations of the initial state is demonstrated in secs.[section : chain ] and [ section : noise ] with the numerical simulations of the spin dynamics of a 17-node chain .",
    "first , in sec.[section : chain ] , the parasitic polarization of two neighboring nodes ( with respect to the selected inner polarized node ) is considered .",
    "then , in sec.[section : noise ] , the noise polarization of all nodes is taken into account using the perturbation method .",
    "deformations of the fermion clusters with the equal pairwise discord under the above perturbations are also considered in secs.[section : chain ] and [ section : noise ] .",
    "the basic results are discussed in sec.[section : conclusions ] . a formula for calculating the discord in the @xmath1-type density matrix @xcite",
    "is represented in the appendix , sec.[section : appendix ] .",
    "[ section : jw ] hereafter we study quantum correlations in the one - dimensional open spin-1/2 chain of @xmath2 nodes governed by the xy hamiltonian with the nearest neighbor interactions , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the larmor frequency in the external magnetic field , @xmath5 is the spin - spin coupling constant between the nearest neighbors , and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) is the @xmath9th spin projection on the @xmath10-axis .",
    "following refs.@xcite , we diagonalize hamiltonian ( [ xy ] ) using the jordan - wigner transformation method @xcite @xmath11 where the fermion operators @xmath12 are determined in terms of other fermion operators @xmath13 by means of the fourier transformation @xmath14 and the fermion operators @xmath13 are determined as @xcite @xmath15 here , @xmath16 we can readily express the projection operators @xmath17 in terms of the fermion operators @xmath13 as @xmath18 hereafter , diagonal representation ( [ hdiag ] ) of the @xmath0 hamiltonian will be used to describe the dynamics of the density matrix associated with the spin-1/2 chain .",
    "the dynamics of the jordan - wigner fermions associated with the spin-1/2 chain with single initially polarized node @xmath19 has been studied in refs.@xcite .",
    "the stationarity of the pairwise discord in such systems is demonstrated therein .",
    "also the fermion clusters with the equal pairwise discord are revealed in those references .",
    "now we consider the initial state with an inner initially polarized node @xmath19 ( i.e. , @xmath20 ) and assume the parasitic low polarization of two neighboring nodes , i.e. the initial density matrix reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the plank constant , @xmath24 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath25 is the temperature of the system .    the motivation for considering this initial state is mentioned in the introduction .",
    "namely , an experimental scheme may not provide the ideal single - node polarization .",
    "so , two neighboring nodes @xmath26 get some polarization as well provided that @xmath19 is the inner node , i.e. @xmath20 .",
    "this polarization might be referred to as the parasitic one . as was shown in @xcite , a fermion cluster with equal pairwise discords ( which is of our interest in this paper )",
    "may be obtained if the polarized node @xmath19 is an inner one .",
    "this case is related to the density matrix ( [ instgen ] ) and is considered below .",
    "the evolution of the initial density matrix ( [ instgen ] ) in virtue of the fermion representation of the hamiltonian ( [ hdiag ] ) reads @xmath27 using the identity @xmath28 we transfer density matrix ( [ rhoev ] ) to the following form @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 finally ,",
    "using the fermion anti - commutation relations @xcite and relations among the coefficients @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xmath33 which follow from the orthogonality relationship @xmath34 we easily transform eq.([rhot0e ] ) to the following canonic form : @xmath35      studing quantum correlations we consider only the pairwise discord .",
    "first , in calculation of the discord between the @xmath36th and @xmath37th fermions , we have to reduce density matrix ( [ rhot3 ] ) with respect to all nodes except for the @xmath36th and @xmath37th ones resulting to the marginal density matrix of the following form : @xmath38 where all coefficients do not depend on the time @xmath39 : @xmath40 next , using the basis @xmath41 ) in the following matrix form : @xmath42      formula ( [ rednm3 ] ) shows that the diagonal elements of marginal matrix ( [ rednm3 ] ) do not depend on the time @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath39-dependence appears only in non - diagonal elements .",
    "however , the pairwise discord for the @xmath1-matrix depends on the absolute value @xmath43 of the non - diagonal element ( see the appendix , sec.[section : appendix ] ) and , consequently , does not depend on @xmath39 .",
    "this means that the perturbations considered in this section do not destroy the stationarity of the discord .",
    "however , the distribution of the discord becomes deformed which , eventually , may destroy the fermion clusters with equal pairwise discords .",
    "deformations caused by the parasitic polarizations of @xmath44th nodes are studied numerically in the following subsection .",
    "we represent numerical simulations for a particular case of @xmath45 node spin chain and assume that the polarization is initially concentrated at such a node @xmath19 that the fermion clusters with equal pairwise discord may be selected from the whole system of 17 fermions @xcite .",
    "the interest in this case appears because such clusters might be promising in the qip - devices as candidates for large quantum registers .    in accordance with @xcite",
    ", such a cluster @xmath46 appears in an odd - node spin chain in two cases .",
    "first , if @xmath19 is the middle node ( @xmath47 in our case ) , then the cluster @xmath46 is formed by the odd - fermions .",
    "second , if @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 ( in our case @xmath45 , @xmath51 , so that @xmath52 ) , then the cluster @xmath46 is formed by the all fermions except each third one . in both cases , the pairwise discord @xmath53 between the @xmath36th and @xmath37th node is @xmath54 in other words , the discord @xmath53 is zero if at least one of the subscripts @xmath36 or @xmath37 is not in the set @xmath46 .",
    "thus , we consider two clusters corresponding to two cases of the initially polarized node @xmath19 :    1 .",
    "@xmath52 , the cluster of fermions with equal pairwise discords is formed by all fermions except each third one : @xmath55 2 .",
    "@xmath47 , the odd fermions form the cluster with equal pairwise discords : @xmath56    we characterize the polarization by the inverse temperatures @xmath57 in practice , @xmath58 must be such that @xmath59 is several times less then @xmath60 . below we take @xmath61 ( the low temperature limit ) .",
    "the presence of the parasitic polarization leads to a deformation of the ideal ( when @xmath62 ) discord distribution shown in fig.[fig:3dgen]a . as a result",
    ", some spread of discord appears in the cluster @xmath46 . besides",
    ", the zero - valued discords at @xmath63 become non - zero for @xmath64 .    to characterize both these effects of parasitic polarization ,",
    "we introduce the following functions @xmath65 here , the notation @xmath66 means @xmath67 .",
    "functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 characterize the spread of the pairwise discord in clusters ( [ cl6 ] ) and ( [ cl9 ] ) , while @xmath70 and @xmath71 characterize the spread of the `` parasitic '' discord that was zero in the unperturbed case , i.e. @xmath72 the graphs of the functions @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath52 and @xmath47 are shown in fig.[fig : gen]a and fig.[fig : gen]b respectively .",
    "the function @xmath76 ( although it is non - zero for @xmath64 ) is not shown because it is not important in this section .",
    "but it will be used in sec.[section : num2 ] to characterize the noise effects .",
    "a natural question is about the critical value of the parameter @xmath58 ( characterizing the value of the `` parasitic '' polarization ) that still does not completely destroy the cluster @xmath46 .",
    "we considered the value of @xmath58 corresponding to the intersection point of @xmath74 and @xmath75 as the critical value @xmath77 , so that the cluster @xmath46 does not exist if @xmath78 .",
    "the critical value is @xmath79 for @xmath52 and @xmath80 for @xmath47 , as shown in fig.[fig : gen]a , b .",
    "an example of the discord distribution for @xmath52 and @xmath81 ( at the threshold value ) is shown in fig.[fig:3dgen]b .",
    "we see that this distribution significantly differs from the unperturbed case @xmath63 shown in fig.[fig:3dgen]a .",
    "however , we emphasize ones again , the parasitic polarization does not lead to the evolution of the discord in the considered fermion system , i.e. , the stationarity of the pairwise discord is not destroyed .",
    "in this section , we assume that there is no parasitic polarization considered in sec.[section : chain ] ( i.e. @xmath82 ) , but there is noise - polarization of all nodes .",
    "the initial density matrix ( [ instgen ] ) must be replaced with the following one : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the double noise - polarization amplitude in a spin-1/2 chain , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 are the random numbers inside of the interval @xmath87 . using eqs.([betc ] ) , ( [ izc ] ) we transform the initial density matrix to the following form @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89",
    "the quantities @xmath90 , @xmath91 , are proportional to @xmath84 and thus they are considered as small parameters hereafter .",
    "now we assume that the noise effect can be studied by the perturbation method for small @xmath84 .",
    "thus , we expand the initial density matrix in the @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "we consider two density matrices cutting the series and keeping the terms up to the order , respectively , @xmath90 and @xmath92 .",
    "taking into account the normalization condition ( trace of density matrix equals unit ) we write these matrices as follows : @xmath93 @xmath94 the evolution of these matrices @xmath95 , taking into account the fermion representation of the hamiltonian ( given by formula ( [ hdiag ] ) ) and relation ( [ identity ] ) , reads : @xmath96 @xmath97 formulas ( [ rhotnev ] ) may be transformed to form ( [ rhot30 ] ) with @xmath98 @xmath99 for the density matrix @xmath100 , or @xmath101",
    "@xmath102 for the density matrix @xmath103 . in this section , formulas ( [ rhot3]-[rednm3 ] ) hold as well .",
    "the stationarity of the pairwise quantum discord between fermions follows from the structure of the marginal matrix @xmath104 ( [ rednm3 ] ) and can be shown in a way similar to that proposed in sec.[section : chain ] .",
    "similar to the numerical simulations of sec.[section : num1 ] , we perform the numerical simulations for the particular case of @xmath45 node spin chain with the initially polarized spins @xmath52 and @xmath47 . for each fixed value of the small parameter @xmath84 in the interval @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) we average the discord over @xmath107 realizations of the random set of the parameters @xmath86 , @xmath108 , characterizing the noise - polarization of the @xmath109th node of the spin-1/2 chain . for the averaged discord",
    ", we use the same notation @xmath53 in this section .    again , to characterize the deformation of the discord distribution caused by the noise - polarization , we use the functions @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 defined by formulas ( [ clcl ] ) and ( [ zz ] ) in which we replace @xmath58 with @xmath84 to characterize the spread of the discord in the cluster @xmath46 and the spread of the parasitic discord , which is zero in the absence of noise .",
    "pairs of functions @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 are shown , respectively , in figs.[fig : noise]a and @xmath114 for @xmath52 and in figs.[fig : noise]c and [ fig : noise]d for @xmath47 .",
    "we see that the difference between the discord distribution corresponding to the density matrices @xmath100 and @xmath103 is not significant inside the interval @xmath105 , as is shown in figs.[fig : noise ] .",
    "more exactly , the curves @xmath68 corresponding to the maximal discord for the density matrices @xmath100 and @xmath103 are close to each other ( see the upper solid and dashed lines in figs.[fig : noise]a and [ fig : noise]c ) , as well as the appropriate curves @xmath69 ( see the lower solid and dashed lines in figs.[fig : noise]a and [ fig : noise]c ) .",
    "the same statement holds for the curves @xmath70 and @xmath71 in figs.[fig : noise]b and [ fig : noise]d .",
    "this serves us as a justification of using the perturbation theory .    to demonstrate the value of the deformation of the discord distribution under the small amplitude noise - polarization we represent the discord distribution in the cluster of correlated fermions for the initially polarized node @xmath52 , the density matrix @xmath115 , and the noise - amplitude @xmath116 in fig.[fig:3dnoise ] .",
    "the comparison of fig.[fig:3dnoise ] with fig.[fig:3dgen]a shows that the deformation of the discord distribution is approximately negligible in the cluster of the correlated fermions @xmath46 .",
    "it is important that the noise does not destroy the stationarity of the discord distribution , similar to the parasitic polarization considered in sec.[section : chain ] .",
    "in the previous section , we demonstrate that the pairwise discord in the jordan - wigner fermion system with a single initially polarized node remains stationary under perturbations of two types : the parasitic polarization of two neighboring nodes and the noise polarization considered by the perturbation method . in both cases , the density matrix operator involves at most three - fermion terms , see eqs.([rhot0e ] ) and ( [ rhotn ] ) .",
    "however , it can be readily shown that the stationarity may not be destroyed by the noise polarization even if we take into account all terms of the perturbed density matrix . or , even more generally , the distribution of the pairwise discord is stationary for the initial density matrix of the form @xmath117 where @xmath118 s are scalar constants .",
    "the evolution of the density matrix described by the liouville equation @xmath119 $ ] reads : @xmath120 after some transformations using equations ( [ hdiag ] ) , ( [ betc ] ) , ( [ izc ] ) and ( [ identity ] ) , we obtain the density matrix in the form ( we write the @xmath39-dependence explicitly ) @xmath121 where @xmath10 s are expressed in terms of @xmath118 s .",
    "eq.([rhot0 ] ) is an infinite series .",
    "an important fact of its structure is that the product of the operators @xmath122 appears together with the exponential @xmath123 .",
    "considering the reduced density matrix operator with respect to all fermions except for the @xmath36th and @xmath37th ones we obtain the density matrix in the form @xmath124 where all the coefficients @xmath125 s are expressed in terms of the coefficients @xmath10 s of eq.([rhot0 ] ) and do not depend on @xmath39 .",
    "we do not give the explicite expressions for the @xmath125 s .",
    "terms of higher degrees in the @xmath126-operators do not appear in the two - particle density matrix operator ( [ rhot000 ] ) because of the fermion operator property @xmath127 .",
    "using the basis ( [ basis ] ) , we may represent the density operator ( [ rhot000 ] ) in the matrix form : @xmath128 thus , the @xmath39-dependence appears only in the exponents in the non - diagonal elements .",
    "now we repeat the arguments used in the demonstration of the discord stationarity in secs.[section : stationarity ] and [ section : noise ] .",
    "namely , it is shown in the appendix , that the pairwise discord in x - matrix ( [ rednm ] ) depends on the absolute value @xmath129 of the non - diagonal element of this matrix .",
    "consequently the discord does not depend on the time @xmath39 .",
    "in this paper we show that the property of stationarity for the pairwise discord in the system of jordan - wigner fermions is stable with respect to the polarization - like perturbations of the initial state .",
    "two types of such parasitic polarizations are considered in details .",
    "the first one is associated with the experimental error in the creation of the single - node polarization initial state resulting in low polarizations of the neighboring nodes .",
    "the second one is related with the noise - polarization of all nodes .",
    "the only effect of both such perturbations is deformation of the pairwise discord distribution in the cluster @xmath46 of correlated fermions . in particular",
    ", such perturbations can destroy the cluster , which is explicitly demonstrated in sec.[section : chain ] for the case of two neighboring node parasitic polarization .",
    "thus , the discord stationarity in the jordan - wigner fermion system can be taken as a reliable and stable advantage of the considered fermion system in comparison with the original spin system .",
    "this encourages us to consider the possibility of a quantum gate realization on the basis of such systems of virtual particles .",
    "this work is supported by the program of the presidium of ras no.8  development of methods of obtaining chemical compounds and creation of new materials  and by the russian foundation for basic research , grant no.13 - 03 - 00017 .",
    "the two - particle density matrix considered in this paper is a particular case of the so - called x - matrix @xcite : @xmath130 the discord for the x - matrix was studied in @xcite .",
    "remind that the discord between particles @xmath36 and @xmath37 of a biparticle quantum system can be calculated as @xmath131 provided that the von neumann type measurements are performed over the particle @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath132 is the total mutual information @xcite , which may be written as follows : @xmath133 where @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) are the non - zero eigenvalues of the density matrix @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 and @xmath139 are the marginal density matrices .",
    "the appropriate entropies @xmath140 and @xmath141 are given by the following formulas : @xmath142 the so - called classical counterpart @xmath143 of the mutual information can be found considering the minimization over projective measurements performed on the particle @xmath37 as follows @xcite : @xmath144}(p_0 s_0 + p_1 s_1),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath145 here , the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath146 are related by the equation @xcite @xmath147 it is simple to show that the quantum discord @xmath148 obtained performing the von neumann type measurements on the particle @xmath36 is related with @xmath149 as follows : @xmath150 for the system with the density matrix @xmath151 given by eq.([xmatr ] ) .",
    "then we define the discord @xmath53 as the minimum of @xmath152 and @xmath153 @xcite @xmath154 with the obvious property @xmath155 .",
    "we see that , if @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 do not depend on the time @xmath39 , then the discord does not evolve with the time as well .",
