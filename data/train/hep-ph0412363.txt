    "the existence of pentaquark baryons is thus not conclusive at the present time . with isospin @xmath23 at a mass @xmath24 mev . ] in spite of this situation , it seems worthwhile at this stage to collect together in one place the various references to the literature with a brief review of major experimental and theoretical works in this rapidly expanding area of investigation .",
    "the results from recent experiments are summarized in tables [ tab : positive ] and [ tab : negative ] .",
    "we see that the positive ( table  [ tab : positive ] ) and negative ( table  [ tab : negative ] ) reports on the existence of @xmath20 are almost equally divided . and",

    "[ fig : kn - tm ] , we give our results for @xmath28 invariant mass distribution coming solely from the tensor meson photoproduction part .",
    "although their maximal values locate at around 1.56 gev at @xmath29 gev ( solid curve ) , the shapes are very broad and most of the magnitudes are much smaller than the other backgrounds by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , the tensor meson contributions estimated within our model based on vector meson exchange are too weak to generate any narrow peak in the presence of other much larger background processes even if the @xmath30 meson background is removed .",
    "we therefore conclude that we could not verify the claim of ref .",
    "our results also show that , if the peak is from the tensor meson background , its position should change with different photon beam energies .",
    "the double differential cross sections are calculated for the three cases ; no pentaquark , even - parity @xmath0 , and odd - parity @xmath0 .",
    "since we are interested in the existence and parity of isoscalar @xmath2 , we now focus on the @xmath19 reaction , which has larger cross sections than @xmath31 .    shown in fig .  [",

    "the dotted line is for the background , i.e. , without @xmath2 .",
    "our result shows that the differential cross sections are enhanced by the presence of even - parity @xmath2 in the forward scattering region of @xmath36 meson direction .",
    "this suggests that the kinematic cut for the angle of @xmath36 would be useful to enhance the @xmath2 peak in @xmath28 mass distributions .",
    "but for the odd - parity @xmath2 , this enhancement is small .",
    "this difference is primarily due to the magnitude of the @xmath2 couplings .",
    "we have also calculated some spin asymmetries of this reaction . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , however , we can not avoid model - dependence on the spin asymmetries in most reactions , which makes it very hard to study the parity of @xmath2 by the spin asymmetries except some special cases like the @xmath39 reaction near the threshold .",
    "therefore , we do not present our results on the spin asymmetries and do not make a definite conclusion on the dependence of spin asymmetries on the parity of @xmath2 . instead",
    ", we make a comment on the spin asymmetries of the model considered in this work .",
    "we have considered two spin asymmetries , the single photon beam asymmetry @xmath40 and beam - target double asymmetry @xmath41 for the @xmath42 reaction at the same energies as in fig .",
    "[ fig : diff2 - 2.3 ] .",
    "( for their definitions , see ref .  @xcite . )",
    "the considered asymmetries , the photon beam asymmetry and beam - target double asymmetry , were found to be rather sensitive to the parity of the @xmath0 .",
    "but in the case of beam - target double asymmetry , the difference between the odd - parity @xmath2 and the background processes is found to be not large .",
    "although the model - dependence is unavoidable , our model calculation shows that these spin asymmetries may have different values depending on the parity of @xmath0 , especially in the forward scattering region .",
    "angles are different , these two models are consistent at least qualitatively at forward angles of the @xmath36 momentum in the center of mass frame . in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is claimed that the single and double spin asymmetries are not sensitive to the parity of the @xmath0 .",
    "we found that this comes mainly from the role of the @xmath43 exchanges , fig .",
    "[ fig : theta](f , g ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors used the signal to background ratio to constrain the ratio @xmath44 , which leads to @xmath45 and @xmath46 for the even and odd parity @xmath2 .",
    "as a consequence , they have the @xmath43-exchange dominance in the @xmath2 production mechanism especially in the case of odd - parity @xmath2 , and as a result the single and double asymmetries are not sensitive to the parity of @xmath2 . in our calculation",
    "we used @xmath47 and @xmath48 for the even and odd parity @xmath2 following the quark model predictions .",
    "we also found that the spin asymmetries are sensitive to the parity of @xmath2 is @xmath49 for the odd parity @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , this illustrates the model - dependence of the asymmetries and it is very important to estimate the correct order of magnitude of @xmath50 , which is , however , not possible at the present state . ]",
    "we have also calculated these asymmetries at a given angle @xmath35 as functions of @xmath51 .",
    "( @xmath52 for @xmath40 and @xmath53 for @xmath54 ) we could find the resonance structure in these asymmetries when the @xmath2 has even parity . for odd - parity @xmath2 , as can be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : diff2 - 2.3 ] , its contribution is small and the resonance structure in the beam - target double asymmetry is not manifested .",
    "thus , although the parity of @xmath0 may not be uniquely determined by these asymmetries because of model - dependence @xcite , our results suggest that the resonance structure in the asymmetries can be used to verify the existence of @xmath2 .",
    "in this work , we have investigated how the @xmath1 reaction can be used to study the production and the properties of the pentaquark @xmath0 baryon .",
    "we study the case that @xmath0 is a spin @xmath55 and isospin @xmath56 particle , and have focused on the influence of the ( non-@xmath2 ) background amplitudes due to the ( tree ) @xmath57-channel drell diagrams ( fig .",

    "the charged tensor meson production amplitude is calculated from a one - pion - exchange model , which describes well the total cross section data of @xmath58 .",
    "the neutral tensor meson production part is estimated by using the vector meson exchange mechanisms .",
    "the coupling constants needed for calculating all of the considered background mechanisms are deduced from the data of decay widths by imposing the su(3 ) symmetry or making use of various quark model predictions .",
    "no attempt is made to calculate other background amplitudes which are kinematically allowed but can not be computed because of the lack of experimental information .",
    "thus the present work represents only a step toward a complete dynamical description of the @xmath1 reaction .",
    "nevertheless , some progress has been made in assessing the existing data concerning the existence of the @xmath0 pentaquark state .    the @xmath0 production mechanism ( fig .  [ fig : theta ] )",
    "is calculated by taking 1 mev as its decay width , which is close to the particle data group value . with the background amplitude constrained by the total cross section data of @xmath59 ( the considered isoscalar @xmath0 is not allowed in the process ) , we find that the resulting @xmath17 and @xmath18 invariant mass distributions of the @xmath19 reaction can qualitatively reproduce the shapes of the jlab data although its magnitude can not be compared",
    ". however , the predicted @xmath0 peak can not be identified unambiguously with the data .",
    "there are two possible interpretations of our results .",
    "first , it is possible that the @xmath0 is produced and the discrepancy between the data and our results is due to the low statistics and limited resolution of the experiment . on the other hand ,",
    "the discrepancy is perhaps due to the deficiency of our model in accounting for other possible non-@xmath2 mechanisms and the existence of @xmath0 is questionable .",
    "obviously , high statistics and high resolution experiments are needed .",
    "the existence of @xmath0 can be unambiguously established if and only if a very sharp resonance peak , which is very unlikely from the background amplitudes as predicted by our model , is observed .",
    "we also find that an even - parity @xmath2 is more likely to be detected , while it will be difficult to identify an odd - parity @xmath2 , even if it exists , from the background continuum , unless it has much larger coupling to the @xmath60 channel than the current quark model predictions and/or other relevant production mechanism(s ) not considered in this work .",
    "we have analyzed in some detail the contributions of the tensor meson to @xmath12 reaction , which is an important issue raised by dzierba _",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "( see also ref .",
    "these authors indicated that the observed peak at 1540 mev in the @xmath28 invariant mass distribution could be a false peak arising from tensor meson background .",

    "@xcite is based on the @xmath10 exchange mechanism which can not take place in neutral tensor meson photoproduction if the @xmath11-parity is conserved .",
    "( 2 ) instead of @xmath10 exchange , we estimate the neutral tensor meson contributions by using the vector meson exchange model , and have found that the neutral tensor meson contribution is too weak to generate any resonance peak which can be identified with the existing data of @xmath61 reaction .",
    "finally , we also present the double differential cross sections and make a comment on the spin asymmetries .",
    "our results show that some kinematic cut would enhance the peak of @xmath2 , if exists . in the spin asymmetries ,",

    "here , we discuss how we restore current conservation with the form factors in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff ] ) . introducing form factors",
    "breaks current conservation .",
    "so , motivated by the works of refs .",
    "@xcite , we restore current conservation by introducing contact diagrams , which effectively changes the form factors of some diagrams into a universal form factor .",
    "for example , let us assume that we have two diagrams , @xmath318 and @xmath319 , and , when combined , these two diagrams satisfy current conservation without form factors .",
    "the corresponding form factors @xmath320 and @xmath321 as functions of mandelstam variables break current conservation . introducing contact diagrams effectively gives the universal form factor which is a constant  @xcite or in the form of  @xcite , @xmath322 so that the current conservation condition is satisfied .",
    "it was pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite that such a choice would not satisfy crossing symmetry and another form was suggested , although not unique , @xmath323 in this work , since we have three - body final state , we extend the above method to the diagrams which spoil current conservation due to form factors .",
    "but we do not make any modification to the purely transverse amplitudes , such as the terms with @xmath43 exchanges and photo - transitions among hadrons , which are constructed to be gauge - invariant by themselves individually . for later use",
    ", we define the mandelstam variables as @xmath324 where the momenta of the initial photon and the nucleon are @xmath325 and @xmath326 , respectively , while those of @xmath327 , @xmath212 , and the final nucleon are @xmath328 , @xmath329 , and @xmath330 , respectively .      among the possible ( tree )",
    "@xmath57-channel drell diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : drell ] , those diagrams with intermediate @xmath43 have transverse amplitude only , i.e. , each diagram satisfied current conservation individually and introducing form factors does not spoil the current conservation condition .",
    "the current conservation problem occurs only when we have intermediate @xmath212 and @xmath327 mesons , namely , @xmath331 and @xmath42 , since they do not contribute to the reactions of @xmath31 and @xmath332 .",
    "then the amplitude takes a form of @xmath333 where @xmath334 where @xmath335 and the form of @xmath336 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ff ] ) .",
    "one can verify that the amplitude ( [ eq : dr ] ) satisfies current conservation condition when the form factors are set to be 1 , @xmath337 the condition , @xmath338 , is satisfied by introducing the contact diagrams , which effectively replaces @xmath320 , @xmath321 , and @xmath339 by @xmath340      since the form factors and their cutoff parameters are fixed by vector meson photoproduction and tensor meson photoproduction processes where the vector or tensor mesons are on mass - shell , we need to include the form factors in order to take into account the off - shell  ness of the intermediate vector / tensor mesons .",
    "furthermore , the amplitudes @xmath341 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vm - part ] ) and @xmath342 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tm - part ] ) are constructed to satisfy the current conservation condition .",
    "so the form factor which should be multiplied in addition to the form factors for vector / tensor meson photoproduction part reads @xmath343 where @xmath344 is the ( produced ) vector meson or tensor meson mass .        in this case , since we adopt the pseudoscalar coupling , we have five diagrams as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : hyp](a)-(e ) .",
    "the possible intermediate states are @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath153 .",
    "we first consider the case of @xmath153 , which have the properties as @xmath345 where the superscripts @xmath346 denote the proton and neutron , respectively , and the subscripts specify the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : hyp ] .    for @xmath331",
    ", we have @xmath347 because of the properties of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pr1 ] ) , we have @xmath348 without form factors .",
    "since the amplitudes @xmath349 and @xmath350 correspond to a part of @xmath163 photoproduction , which should have nontrivial form factors , we replace the form factors as @xmath351 similarly , @xmath352 so that current conservation is now satisfied with the form factors .      for @xmath19 , we have @xmath357 where the form factors @xmath320 , @xmath321 , and @xmath354",
    "are replaced by @xmath358 since @xmath359 and @xmath360 are transverse , the form factors @xmath339 and @xmath355 are not changed .      the intermediate @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath5 states are the same as the case of @xmath362 . as a consequence",
    ", these intermediate states do not exist for the @xmath31 and @xmath19 reactions .",
    "we replace the form factors as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sig1 ] ) for @xmath363 .",
    "the amplitudes for @xmath332 are all transverse .        for @xmath331 , we have @xmath365 in this case , the direct application of the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath366 can not be used .",
    "this is because the above form factor becomes 1 if , for example , any of ( @xmath320 , @xmath339 , @xmath367 ) is 1 . and",
    "this in fact happens when the intermediate @xmath208 becomes on mass - shell , @xmath368 since @xmath369 .",
    "since these diagrams are a part of photoproduction of @xmath212 and @xmath208 , this means that those amplitudes have no form factor .",

    "<S> the recent developments in the search of exotic pentaquark hadrons are briefly reviewed . </S>",
    "<S> we then focus on investigating how the exotic pentaquark @xmath0 baryon production can be identified in the @xmath1 reactions , focusing on the influence of the background ( non-@xmath2 production ) mechanisms . by imposing the su(3 ) symmetry and using various quark model predictions , we are able to fix the coupling constants for evaluating the kaon backgrounds , the @xmath3 production through the intermediate vector meson and tensor meson photoproduction , and the mechanisms involving intermediate @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 states . </S>",
    "<S> the vector meson photoproduction part is calculated from a phenomenological model which describes well the experimental data at low energies . </S>",

    "<S> the neutral tensor meson production is estimated by considering the vector meson exchange and found to be too weak to generate any peak at the position near @xmath0 . for @xmath0 production , we assume that it is an isoscalar and hence can only be produced in @xmath12 and @xmath13 reactions , but not in @xmath14 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the total cross section data of @xmath16 is thus used to fix the form factors which regularize the background amplitudes so that the signal of @xmath0 in @xmath12 and @xmath13 cross sections can be predicted . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the predicted @xmath17 and @xmath18 invariant mass distributions of the @xmath19 reaction can qualitatively reproduce the shapes of the jlab data . </S>",
    "<S> however , the predicted @xmath0 peak can not be identified unambiguously with the data . </S>",
    "<S> high statistics experiments are needed to resolve the problem . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that an even - parity @xmath2 is more likely to be detected , while it will be difficult to identify an odd - parity @xmath2 , even if it exists , from the background continuum , if its coupling constants are small as in the present quark model predictions . </S>"
