    "<S> apart from entanglement , quantum states display other correlations not present in classical systems ( meaning , here , systems where all observables commute ) . </S>",
    "<S> aiming at capturing such correlations , ollivier and zurek introduced the quantum discord @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they showed that only in the absence of discord there exists a measurement protocol that enables distant observers to extract all the information about a bipartite system without perturbing it . </S>",
    "<S> this completeness of local measurements is featured by any classical state , but not by quantum states , even some separable ones . </S>",
    "<S> thus , zero discord is a necessary condition for only - classical correlations .    </S>",

    "<S> a prevailing observation in all results obtained so far is that the absence or presence of discord is directly associated to non - trivial properties of states . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is natural to question _ how typical are positive - discord states?_. here we prove that a particular subset of states that contains _ the set of zero - discord states , has measure zero and is nowhere dense_. that is , it is topologically negligible : typically , every state picked out at random has positive discord ; and given a state with zero discord , a generic ( arbitrarily small ) perturbation will take it to a state of strictly positive discord . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , these results hold true for any hilbert space dimension and are thus in contrast with expectations based on the structure of entangled states @xcite : while the set of separable states has positive volume , the set of only - classically correlated states does not . </S>",

    "<S> we suggest a schematic geometrical representation of the set of zero discord , and study the open - system dynamics of discord . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for almost all states of positive discord , the interaction with any ( non - necessarily local ) markovian bath can _ never _ lead either to a sudden , permanent vanishing of discord , nor to one lasting a finite time - interval . in strong contrast to entanglement  which typically vanishes suddenly and permanently at a finite time @xcite  , discord can only permanently vanish in the asymptotic inifnite - time limit , i.e. at the steady state .    </S>",
    "<S> our results have wide - range implications . </S>",
    "<S> first , from a fundamental perspective , they imply that only - classically correlated states are extremely rare in the space of all quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> second , it has been recently discovered that an arbitrary unitary evolution for any system and bath is described ( upon tracing the bath out ) as a completely - positive map on the system if , and only if , system and bath are initially in a zero - discord state @xcite . in view of the rarity of zero - discord states , the fundamental recipe </S>",

    "<S> interesting fact is that quantum discord is present in typical instances of a mixed - state quantum computation @xcite , even when entanglement is absent @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite to suggest that discord might be the resource responsible for the quantum speedup in this computational model . if the mere presence of discord was by itself responsible of some speedup , then our results would imply that almost all quantum states are useful resources </S>",

    "<S> in this basis , the calculation of commutator ( [ oz_nec ] ) is straightforward and gives a set of implicit constraints on a state to belong to @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> these constraints can be inverted to obtain an explicit differentiable parametrization of the set @xmath41 which uses strictly fewer independent real parameters than the ones needed to parametrize @xmath6 . since a differentiable parametrization of a set measure zero is also measure zero , @xmath41 has measure zero in @xmath6 .    _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 is nowhere dense_. the set @xmath41 , apart from being of zero measure , is also nowhere dense , two concepts a priori independent . a set @xmath46 is called nowhere dense ( in @xmath47 ) if there is no neighborhood in @xmath47 on which @xmath46 is dense . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , @xmath46 is said to be nowhere dense if its closure has an empty interior . </S>",

    "<S> if one mixes states block diagonal in the same local basis , then the resulting state is necessarily block diagonal ( in the same basis ) , and therefore belongs to @xmath25 . in particular , every state of zero discord is connected to the maximally mixed state @xmath51 , as the latter is trivially block diagonal in any local basis . </S>",
    "<S> this already shows us that the set @xmath25 is connected . from a geometrical viewpoint </S>",
    "<S> , this means that when moving rectilinearly from every state in @xmath25 towards @xmath51 , only states in @xmath25 are encountered . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the segment from every state out of @xmath25 to @xmath51 is exclusively composed of states out of @xmath25 ( being the two - qubit werner state an instructive and simple example @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> we have shown that states with zero discord are ( densely ) surrounded by states with positive discord . as a consequence , ruling out the presence of quantum discord is , strictly speaking , experimentally impossible ( unless further assumptions are taken ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that any measurement with a non - null error range is compatible with a positive amount of discord . </S>",
    "<S> this is in striking contrast to what happens for entanglement , whose presence can instead be strictly ruled out in experiments .    </S>",
