    "given @xmath0 `` cities '' and the distances between them , the traveling salesman problem ( tsp ) consists of finding the length of the shortest closed `` tour '' ( path ) visiting every city exactly once , where the tour length is the sum of the city - to - city distances along the tour .",
    "the tsp is np - complete , which suggests that there is no general algorithm capable of finding the optimum tour in an amount of time polynomial in @xmath0 .",
    "the problem is thus simple to state , but very difficult to solve .",
    "it also happens to be the most well known combinatorial optimization problem , and has attracted interest from a wide range of fields . in operations research , mathematics and computer science , researchers have concentrated on algorithmic aspects .",
    "a particular focus has been on heuristic algorithms  algorithms which do not guarantee optimal tours  for cases where exact methods are too slow to be of use .",
    "the most effective heuristics are based on local search methods , which start with a non - optimal tour and iteratively improve the tour within a well - defined `` neighborhood '' ; a famous example is the lin - kernighan heuristic @xcite .",
    "more recent efforts have involved combining local search and non - deterministic methods , in order to refine heuristics to the point where they give good enough solutions for practical purposes ; a powerful such technique is chained local optimization @xcite .    over the last fifteen years",
    ", physicists have increasingly been drawn to the tsp as well , and particularly to _ stochastic _ versions of the problem , where instances are randomly chosen from an ensemble .",
    "the motivation has often been to find properties applicable to a large class of disordered systems , either through good approximate methods or through exact analytical approaches . in our work , we consider two such stochastic tsps .",
    "the first , the euclidean tsp , is the more classic form of the problem : @xmath0 cities are placed randomly and independently in a @xmath1-dimensional hypercube , and the distances between cities are defined by the euclidean metric .",
    "the second , the random link tsp , is a related problem developed within the context of disordered systems : rather than specifying the positions of cities , we specify the lengths @xmath11 separating cities @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the @xmath11 are taken to be independent , identically distributed random variables .",
    "the appeal of the random link problem is , on the one hand , that an analytical approach exists for solving it @xcite , and on the other hand , that when certain correlations are neglected this tsp can be made to resemble the euclidean tsp .",
    "we therefore consider the random link problem as a _ random link approximation _ to the ( random point ) euclidean problem .",
    "researchers outside of physics remain largely unaware of the analytical progress made on the random link tsp ; one of our hopes is to demonstrate how these results are of direct interest in problems where the aim is to find the optimum euclidean tsp tour length .",
    "our approach in this paper is then to examine both the euclidean problem and the random link problem  the latter for its own theoretical interest as well as for a better understanding of the euclidean case .",
    "we begin by considering in depth the euclidean tsp , including a review of previous work .",
    "we find that , given periodic boundary conditions ( toroidal geometry ) , the euclidean optimum tour length @xmath14 averaged over the ensemble of all possible instances has the finite size scaling behavior @xmath15\\mbox{.}\\ ] ] from simulations , we extract very precise numerical values for @xmath8 at @xmath16 and @xmath17 ; methodological and numerical procedures are detailed in the appendices .",
    "we also give numerical evidence that the probability distribution of @xmath14 becomes gaussian in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "in addition to these tsp results , we find a surprising universality in the scaling of the mean distance between @xmath2th nearest neighbors , for points randomly distributed in the @xmath1-dimensional hypercube .",
    "finally , we discuss the expected behavior of @xmath8 in the large @xmath1 limit .    in the second part of the paper we discuss the random link problem , considering it as an approximation to the euclidean problem . making use of the cavity method",
    ", we compare the random link @xmath6 with the euclidean @xmath8 values obtained from our simulations .",
    "we find that the random link approximation is correct to within 2% at @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "the rest of the section studies the large @xmath1 limit of the random link model and its implications for the euclidean tsp .",
    "we examine analytically how @xmath6 scales at large @xmath1 , and we relate the @xmath10 coefficient of the associated power series to an underlying @xmath1-independent `` renormalized '' model . finally , we present a theoretical analysis based on the lin - kernighan heuristic , suggesting strongly that the relative difference between @xmath6 and @xmath8 is positive and of @xmath9 .",
    "the random link results then lead to our large @xmath1 euclidean conjecture : @xmath19\\mbox{,}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is euler s constant .",
    "one of the earliest analytical results for the euclidean tsp is due to beardwood , halton and hammersley @xcite ( bhh ) .",
    "the authors considered @xmath0 cities , distributed randomly and independently in a @xmath1-dimensional volume with distances between cities given by the euclidean metric .",
    "they showed that , when the volume is the unit hypercube and the distribution of cities uniform , @xmath21 is self - averaging .",
    "this means that with probability 1 , @xmath22 where @xmath8 is independent of the randomly chosen instances .",
    "this property is illustrated in figure [ fig_selfav ] .",
    "( in fact , the bhh result is more general than this and concerns an arbitrary volume and arbitrary form of the density of cities . ) for a physics audience this large @xmath0 limit is equivalent , in appropriate units , to an infinite volume limit at constant density .",
    "@xmath21 then corresponds to an energy density that is self - averaging and has a well - defined infinite volume limit .",
    "the original proof by bhh is quite complicated ; simpler proofs have since been given by karp and steele @xcite .",
    "( 289,268 )    one of our goals is to determine @xmath8 .",
    "bhh gave rigorous lower and upper bounds as a function of dimension .",
    "for any given instance , a trivial lower bound on @xmath14 is the sum over all cities @xmath12 of the distance between @xmath12 and its nearest neighbor in space .",
    "in fact , since a tour at best links a city with its _ two _ nearest neighbors , this bound can be improved upon by summing , over all @xmath12 , the mean of @xmath12 s nearest and next - nearest neighbor distances .",
    "taking the ensemble average of this quantity ( that is , the average over all instances ) leads to the best analytical lower bound to date . for upper bounds",
    ", bhh introduced a heuristic algorithm , now known as `` strip , '' in order to generate near - optimal tours ( discussed also in a paper by armour and wheeler @xcite ) . in two dimensions",
    "the method involves dividing the square into adjacent columns or strips , and sequentially visiting the cities on a given strip according to their positions along it .",
    "the respective lower and upper bounds give @xmath23 .",
    "in addition to bounds , it is possible to obtain numerical _ estimates _ for @xmath8 .",
    "bhh used two instances , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , from which they estimated @xmath26 using hand - drawn tours .",
    "surprisingly little has been done to improve upon this value in two dimensions , and essentially nothing in higher dimensions .",
    "stein @xcite has found @xmath27 , which is frequently cited .",
    "only recently have better values been obtained , but as they come from near - optimal tours found by heuristic algorithms , they should be considered more as upper bounds than as estimates . using a local search heuristic known as `` 3-opt '' @xcite , ong and huang @xcite have found @xmath28 ; using another heuristic , `` tabu '' search ,",
    "fiechter @xcite has found @xmath29 ; and using a variant of simulated annealing , lee and choi @xcite have found @xmath30 . in what follows",
    "we shall show what is needed for a more precise estimate of @xmath8 with , furthermore , a way to quantify the associated error .      as @xmath31",
    ", @xmath32 converges with probability 1 to the instance - independent @xmath8 .",
    "our estimate of @xmath8 must rest on some assumptions , though , since only finite values of @xmath0 are accessible numerically .",
    "note first that at values of @xmath0 where computation times are reasonable , @xmath14 has substantial instance - to - instance fluctuations . to reduce and at the same time quantify these fluctuations , we average over a large number of instances .",
    "we thus consider the numerical mean of @xmath14 over the instances sampled , which itself satisfies the asymptotic relation ( [ eq_bhh ] ) but with a smoother convergence .",
    "to extract @xmath8 , we must understand precisely what this convergence in @xmath0 is .",
    "if cities were randomly distributed in the hypercube with open boundary conditions , the cities near the boundaries would have fewer neighbors and therefore lengthen the tour . in standard statistical mechanical systems at constant density , boundary effects lead to corrections of the form surface over volume .",
    "for the tsp at constant density , the volume grows as @xmath0 and the surface as @xmath33 . in a @xmath1-dimensional unit hypercube , then , the ensemble average of @xmath14 would presumably have the large @xmath0 behavior @xmath34 in order to extract @xmath8 numerically , it would be necessary to perform a fit which includes these corrections",
    ". a reliable numerical fit , however , must have few adjustable parameters , and the slow convergence of this series would prevent us from extracting @xmath8 to high accuracy .",
    "we therefore have chosen to eliminate these boundary ( surface ) effects by using _",
    "periodic _ boundary conditions in all directions .",
    "this should not change @xmath8 , but leaves us with fewer adjustable parameters and a faster convergence , enabling us to work with smaller values of @xmath0 where numerical simulations are not too slow .    for",
    "the hypercube with periodic boundary conditions , let us introduce the notation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the average of @xmath14 over the ensemble of instances .",
    "( @xmath37 is , in physical units , the zero - temperature energy density . )",
    "we then wish to understand how @xmath37 converges to its large @xmath0 limit , @xmath8 . in standard statistical mechanical systems",
    ", there is a characteristic correlation length @xmath38 .",
    "away from a critical point , @xmath38 is finite , and finite size corrections decrease as @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a measure of the system `` width . '' at a critical point , @xmath38 is infinite , and finite size corrections decrease as a power of @xmath41 . for _",
    "disordered _ statistical systems , however , this picture must be modified .",
    "even if @xmath38 is finite for each instance in the ensemble , the fluctuating disorder can still give rise to power - law corrections for ensemble averaged quantities .",
    "in the case of the tsp , this is particularly clear : the disorder in the positions of the cities induces large finite size effects even on simple geometric quantities .",
    "( 348,222 )    to see how this might affect the convergence of @xmath37 , consider the following .",
    "for a given configuration of @xmath0 points , call @xmath42 the distance between a point and its @xmath2th nearest neighbor , where @xmath43 .",
    "take the points to be distributed randomly and uniformly in the unit hypercube .",
    "let us find @xmath44 .",
    "under periodic boundary conditions , the probability density @xmath45 of finding a point at distance @xmath46 from another point is simply equal ( for @xmath47 ) to the surface area at radius @xmath46 of the @xmath1-dimensional sphere : @xmath48 the probability of finding a point s @xmath2th nearest neighbor at distance @xmath46 ( see figure [ fig_nn ] ) is equal to the probability of finding @xmath49 ( out of @xmath50 ) points within @xmath46 , one point at @xmath46 and the remaining @xmath51 points beyond @xmath46 : @xmath52 & = & { n-1 \\choose k-1}\\,\\left [ \\int_0^l \\rho(l')\\ , dl'\\right]^{k-1 } \\times\\ , ( n - k)\\,\\rho(l)\\,\\times\\ , \\left[1-\\int_0^l \\rho(l')\\,dl'\\right]^{n - k-1}\\\\ & = & { n-1 \\choose k-1}\\ , ( n - k)\\ , d\\left [ \\frac{\\pi^{d/2 } } { \\gamma(d/2 + 1)}\\right]^k l^{dk-1 } \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\pi^{d/2}}{\\gamma(d/2 + 1 ) } l^d \\right]^{n - k-1}\\mbox{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] giving the ensemble average @xmath53^k \\int_0^{1/2 } l^{dk } \\left [ 1 - \\frac{\\pi^{d/2}}{\\gamma(d/2 + 1 ) } l^d \\right]^{n - k-1 } dl\\,+\\,\\cdots \\label{lbeqn}\\ ] ] where the corrections are due to the @xmath54 case , and are exponentially small in @xmath0 .    recognizing the integral , up to a simple change of variable , as a beta function ( @xmath55 ) plus a further remainder term exponentially small in @xmath0 , we see that @xmath56\\mbox{. } \\label{eq_nn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we are confronted here with a remarkable , and hitherto unexplored , universality : the _ exact _ same @xmath57 series gives the @xmath0-dependence regardless of @xmath2 .",
    "the same finite size scaling behavior therefore applies to all @xmath2th nearest neighbor distances .",
    "it might be hoped then that the typical link length in optimum tours would have this @xmath0-dependence , and that @xmath37 would therefore have the same @xmath57 expansion .",
    "this is not quite the case .",
    "the link between cities @xmath12 and @xmath13 figures in the average @xmath44 whenever @xmath13 is the @xmath2th neighbor of @xmath12 ; it figures in @xmath37 , however , only when it belongs to the optimal tour .",
    "two different kinds of averages are being taken , and so finite size corrections need not be identical .",
    "nevertheless , it remains plausible that @xmath37 has a @xmath57 series expansion , albeit a different one from ( [ eq_nn ] ) .",
    "while we can not prove this property , it is confirmed by an analysis of our numerical data .",
    "our approach to finding @xmath8 is thus as follows : ( i ) we consider the ensemble average @xmath36 , rather than @xmath14 for a given instance , in order to have a quantity with a well - defined dependence on @xmath0 ; ( ii ) we use periodic boundary conditions to eliminate surface effects ; ( iii ) we sample the ensemble using numerical simulations , and measure @xmath37 within well controlled errors ; ( iv ) we extract @xmath8 by fitting these values to a @xmath57 series .",
    "let us consider the @xmath16 case in detail .",
    "we found the most effective numerical optimization methods for our purposes to be the local search heuristics lin - kernighan ( lk ) @xcite and chained local optimization ( clo ) @xcite mentioned in the introduction .",
    "both heuristics , by definition , give tour lengths that are not always optimal .",
    "however , it is not necessary that the optimum be found 100% of the time : there is already a significant statistical error arising from instance - to - instance fluctuations , and so a further systematic error due to non - optimal tours is acceptable as long as this error is kept negligible compared to the statistical error .",
    "our methods , along with relevant numerical details , are discussed in the appendices .",
    "for the present purposes , let us simply mention the general nature of the two heuristics used .",
    "lk works by performing a `` variable - depth '' local search , as discussed further in section [ sect_rl_estimate ] .",
    "clo works by an iterative process combining lk optimizations with random perturbations to the tour , in order to explore many different local neighborhoods .",
    "we used lk for `` small '' @xmath0 values ( @xmath58 ) , averaging over 250,000 instances at each value of @xmath0 , and we used clo for `` large '' @xmath0 values ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) , averaging over 10,000 and 6,000 instances respectively .",
    "( 300,274 )    we fitted our resulting @xmath37 estimates to a truncated @xmath57 series : the fits are good , and are stable with respect to the use of sub - samples of the data . for a fit of the form @xmath61 ,",
    "we find @xmath62 , with @xmath63 for 8 data points and 3 fit parameters ( 5 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "our error estimate for @xmath64 is obtained by the standard method of performing fits using a range of fixed values for this parameter : the error bar @xmath65 is determined by the values of @xmath64 which make @xmath66 exceed its original result by exactly 1 , i.e. , making @xmath67 in this case .",
    "it is possible to extract another @xmath37 estimate by making direct use of the universality discussed previously : the universal @xmath57 series in ( [ eq_nn ] ) suggests that there will be a faster convergence if we use the rescaled data @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "this also has the appealing property of leading to a function monotonic in @xmath0 , as shown in figure [ fig_fss ] .",
    "we find @xmath69 with the leading term having the same error bar of @xmath65 as before .",
    "note that the @xmath57 term in the fit is small  2 orders of magnitude smaller than the leading order coefficient  and so to first order the @xmath70 series is itself a good approximation .",
    "the same methodology was applied to the @xmath17 case .",
    "the @xmath66s again confirmed the functional form of the fit , and we find from our data @xmath71 . also , since our initial work @xcite , johnson _",
    "_  have performed simulations at @xmath72 , obtaining results @xcite consistent with ours : @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "while bhh and others @xcite have shown that the variance of @xmath21 goes to zero as @xmath31 ( see also figure [ fig_selfav ] ) , they have not determined how fast this variance decreases .",
    "more generally , one might ask how the _ distribution _ of @xmath21 behaves as @xmath31 .",
    "we are aware of only one result , by rhee and talagrand @xcite , showing that the probability of finding @xmath14 with @xmath76 is smaller than @xmath77 for some @xmath78 .",
    "unfortunately this is not strong enough to give bounds on the variance .",
    "let us characterize the distribution at @xmath16 by numerical simulation . for motivation",
    ", consider the analogy between @xmath21 and @xmath79 , the energy density in a disordered statistical system .",
    "if the system s correlation length @xmath38 is finite ( the system is not critical ) , @xmath79 has a distribution which becomes gaussian when @xmath80 .",
    "this is because as the subvolumes increase , the energy densities in each subvolume become uncorrelated ; the central limit theorem then applies .",
    "a consequence is that @xmath81 , the variance of @xmath79 , decreases as @xmath82 . if @xmath38 is infinite ( the system is critical ) , then in general the distribution of @xmath79 is not gaussian . in both cases",
    "though , the self - averaging of @xmath79 suggests that the scaling variable @xmath83 has a limiting distribution when @xmath80 .    in the case of the tsp",
    ", it can be argued using a theoretical analysis of the lk heuristic that at @xmath84 the system is not critical . by analogy with @xmath79",
    ", if we take subvolumes to contain a fixed number of cities , the central limit theorem then suggests that @xmath21 has a gaussian distribution with @xmath81 decreasing as @xmath85 .",
    "the scaling variable @xmath86 should consequently have a gaussian distribution with a finite width for @xmath31 ( and at @xmath84 ) .",
    "numerical results at @xmath16 ( see figure [ fig_dist ] ) give good support for this .",
    "( 288,274 )      in most statistical mechanics problems , the large dimensional limit introduces simplifications because fluctuations become negligible . for the tsp",
    ", can one expect @xmath8 to have a simple limit as @xmath87 ?",
    "again , consider the property of the @xmath2th nearest neighbor distance @xmath88 . in the large @xmath0 limit , ( [ eq_nn ] )",
    "gives @xmath89\\mbox { , } \\label{eq_largek}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 ( @xmath20 is euler s constant ) .",
    "notice that @xmath91 at large @xmath2 .",
    "this suggests strongly that unless the `` typical '' @xmath2 used in the optimum tour grows exponentially in @xmath1 , we may write for @xmath92 : @xmath93\\mbox{.}\\ ] ] up to @xmath94 , this expression is identical to the bhh lower bound on @xmath8 discussed in section [ sect_e_scaling ] , given by the large @xmath0 limit of @xmath95 .    a weaker conjecture than ( [ eq_dimscal ] ) has been proposed by bertsimas and van ryzin @xcite : @xmath96 this limiting behavior was motivated by an analogous result for a related combinatorial optimization problem , the minimum spanning tree .",
    "unfortunately , there is no proof of either ( [ eq_dimscal ] ) or ( [ eq_bertsimas ] ) ; in particular , the upper bound on @xmath8 given by strip , discussed in section [ sect_e_scaling ] , behaves as @xmath97 at large @xmath1 .",
    "thus if the conjectures are true , the strip construction leads asymptotically to tours which are on average 1.69 times too long .",
    "can we derive stronger upper bounds ?",
    "a number of heuristic construction methods should do better than strip , but there are no reliable calculations to this effect .",
    "the only improvements over the bhh results are due to smith @xcite , who generalized the strip algorithm by optimizing the shape of the strips , leading to an upper bound which is @xmath98 times greater than the predictions of ( [ eq_dimscal ] ) and ( [ eq_bertsimas ] ) at large @xmath1 .    in spite of our inability to derive an upper bound which",
    ", together with the bhh lower bound , would confirm the two conjectures for @xmath87 , we are confident that ( [ eq_dimscal ] ) and ( [ eq_bertsimas ] ) are true because of non - rigorous yet convincing arguments .",
    "one is a proof that ( [ eq_bertsimas ] ) is satisfied for the tsp if it is satisfied for another related combinatorial optimization problem ( see [ app_heuristics ] for details ) .",
    "a more powerful argument , presented in section [ sect_rl_estimate ] , relies on a theoretical analysis of the lk heuristic .",
    "it suggests that up to @xmath9 , @xmath8 is given by a random link approximation , leading to a conjecture even stronger than ( [ eq_dimscal ] ) .",
    "let us now consider a problem at first sight dramatically different from the euclidean tsp . instead of taking the positions of the @xmath0 cities to be independent random variables ,",
    "take the lengths @xmath99 between cities @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath100 ) to be independent random variables , identically distributed according to some @xmath45 .",
    "we speak of lengths rather than distances , as there is no distance metric here .",
    "this problem , introduced by physicists in the 1980s @xcite in search of an analytically tractable form of the traveling salesman problem , is called the _",
    "random link tsp_.    the connection between this tsp and the euclidean tsp is not obvious , as we now have random links rather than random points .",
    "nevertheless , one can relate the two problems . to see this ,",
    "consider the probability distribution for the distance @xmath46 between a fixed pair of cities ( @xmath12,@xmath13 ) in the euclidean tsp .",
    "this distribution , in the unit hypercube with periodic boundary conditions , is given for @xmath101 by the expression in ( [ eq_probdens ] ) : @xmath102    of course , in the euclidean tsp the link lengths are by no means _ independent _ random variables : correlations such as the triangle inequality are present .",
    "however , as noted by mzard and parisi @xcite , correlations appear exclusively when considering three or more distances , since any two euclidean distances are necessarily independent .",
    "let us adopt ( [ eq_distribution ] ) as the @xmath11 distribution in the limit of small @xmath46 for the random link tsp , where @xmath1 in this case no longer represents physical dimension but is simply a parameter of the model .",
    "the euclidean and random link problems then have the same small @xmath46 one- and two - link distributions . in the large @xmath0 limit the random link tsp",
    "may therefore be considered , rather than as a separate problem , as a _",
    "random link approximation _ to the euclidean tsp",
    ". only joint distributions of three or more links differ between these two tsps .",
    "if indeed the correlations involved are not too important , then the random link @xmath6 can be taken as a good estimate of @xmath8 .",
    "we shall see that this is true , particularly for large @xmath1 .      as in the euclidean case",
    ", we are interested in understanding the @xmath103 scaling law in the random link tsp .",
    "it is relatively simple to see , following an argument similar to the one in section [ sect_e_methodology ] , that the nearest neighbor distances @xmath88 have a probability distribution with a scaling factor @xmath104 at large @xmath0 .",
    "vannimenus and mzard @xcite have suggested that the random link optimum tour length with @xmath0 links will then scale as @xmath33 , and the tour will be self - averaging , i.e. , @xmath105 parallel to the bhh theorem ( [ eq_bhh ] ) for the euclidean case .",
    "this involves the implicit assumption that optimum tours sample a representative part of the @xmath88 distribution , so no further @xmath0 scaling effects are introduced .",
    "the assumption seems reasonable based on the analogy with the euclidean tsp , and for our purposes we shall accept here that @xmath6 exists",
    ". however , there is to our knowledge no mathematical proof of self - averaging in the random link tsp .    following the discussion of section [ sect_e_scaling ] ,",
    "let us consider some bounds on the ensemble average @xmath106 as derived in @xcite .",
    "as before , we get a lower bound on @xmath6 using nearest and next nearest neighbor distances . for an upper bound ,",
    "the `` strip '' algorithm used in the euclidean case ( section [ sect_e_scaling ] ) can not be applied to the random link case . on the other hand , vannimenus and mzard make use of an algorithm called `` greedy '' @xcite : this constructs a non - optimal tour by starting at an arbitrary city , and then successively picking the link to the nearest available city until all cities are used once and a closed tour is formed . at @xmath107 ,",
    "greedy gives rise to tour lengths that are self - averaging , and leads to the upper bound @xcite @xmath108 at @xmath109 , the presumed scaling ( [ eq_betarl ] ) suggests that @xmath106 is independent of @xmath0 , whereas greedy generates tour lengths which grow as @xmath110 .",
    "there is numerical evidence @xcite , however , that the @xmath109 model does indeed satisfy ( [ eq_betarl ] ) , and that @xmath111 .      since the work of vannimenus and mzard , several groups @xcite have tried to `` solve '' the statistical mechanical problem of the random link tsp at finite temperature using the replica method , a technique developed for analyzing disordered systems such as spin glasses @xcite . to date , it has only been possible to obtain part of the high temperature series of this system @xcite .",
    "in view of the intractability of these replica approaches , mzard and parisi have derived an analytical solution using another technique from spin glass theory , the `` cavity method . ''",
    "the details of this approach are beyond the scope of this paper , and are discussed in several technical articles @xcite . for readers acquainted with the language of disordered systems ,",
    "however , the broad outline is as follows : one begins with a representation of the tsp in terms of a heisenberg ( multi - dimensional spin ) model in the limit where the spin dimension goes to zero . under the assumption that this system has only one equilibrium state ( no replica symmetry breaking ) , mzard and parisi",
    "have then written a recursion equation for the system when a new @xmath112th spin is added .",
    "the cavity method then supposes that this new spin s effect on the @xmath0 other spins is negligible in the large @xmath0 limit , and that its magnetization may be expressed in terms of the magnetizations of the other spins .    using this method , krauth and mzard",
    "have derived a self - consistent equation for the random link tsp , at @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "they have determined the probability distribution of link lengths in the optimum tour in terms of @xmath113 , where @xmath113 is the solution to the integral equation @xmath114",

    "compared their prediction with the results of a direct simulation of the random link model ; their numerical study @xcite strongly suggests that the cavity prediction is exact in this case .",
    "it has been argued , furthermore , that the cavity method is exact at @xmath103 for _ any _ distribution of the independent random links @xcite .",
    "good numerical evidence has been found for this , notably in the case of the matching problem , a related combinatorial optimization problem @xcite .",

    "all three claims are based on a theoretical analysis of the lin - kernighan ( lk ) heuristic algorithm for constructing near - optimal tours .",
    "( 231,224 )    the lk algorithm works as follows @xcite .",
    "an _ lk search _ starts with an arbitrary tour .",
    "the principle of the search is to substitute links in the tour recursively , as illustrated schematically in figure [ fig_lk ] .",
    "the first step consists of choosing an arbitrary starting city @xmath160 .",
    "call @xmath161 the next city on the tour , and @xmath162 the link between the two .",
    "now remove this link .",
    "let @xmath163 be the nearest neighbor to @xmath161 that was not connected to @xmath161 on the original tour , and let @xmath164 be a new link connecting @xmath161 to @xmath163 .",
    "we now have not a tour but a `` tadpole graph , '' containing a loop with a tail attached to it at @xmath163 . at this point , call @xmath165 one of the cities next to @xmath163 on the original tour , and remove the link @xmath166 between the two .",
    "there are two possibilities for @xmath165 ( and thus @xmath166 ) : lk chooses the one which , if we were to put in a new link between @xmath165 and @xmath160 , would give a single closed tour . now as before , let @xmath167 be the nearest neighbor of @xmath165 that was not connected to @xmath165 on the original tour , and let @xmath168 be a new link between the two .",
    "this gives a new tadpole .",
    "the process continues recursively in this manner , with the vertex hopping around while the end point stays fixed , until no new tadpoles are found . at each step",
    ", lk chooses the new @xmath169 so as to allow the path to be closed up between @xmath169 and @xmath160 , forming a single tour ; the result of the lk search is then the best of all such closed up tours .",
    "the _ lk algorithm _ consists of repeating these lk searches on different starting points @xmath160 , each time using the current best tour as a starting tour , until no further tour improvements are possible .",
    "let us first sketch why the lk algorithm leads to tours which use only links between `` near '' neighbors , where `` near '' means that the neighborhood order @xmath2 is small and does not grow with @xmath1 . consider any tour where a significant fraction of the links connect distant neighbors ( large @xmath2 ) .",
    "the links @xmath170 which the lk search substitutes for the @xmath171 are , by definition , between very near neighbors ( @xmath172 ) . as long as many long links exist",
    ", the probability at each step of substituting a near neighbor in place of a far neighbor is significant . towards the beginning of an lk search",
    "this probability is relatively constant , so the _ expected _ tadpole length will decrease linearly with the number of steps . even taking into account the fact that closing up the path between @xmath169 and @xmath160 might require inserting a link with @xmath173",
    ", there is a high probability as @xmath103 that the improvement in tadpole length far outweighs this cost of closing the tour .",
    "thus for stochastic tsps , regardless of @xmath1 , the lk algorithm can at large @xmath0 replace all but a tiny fraction of the long links with short links .",
    "it follows that in accordance with our euclidean tsp assumption of section [ sect_e_large_d ] , the `` typical '' @xmath2 used in the optimum tour remains small at large @xmath1 .",
    "this provides very powerful support for the @xmath8 conjectures ( [ eq_dimscal ] ) and ( [ eq_bertsimas ] ) .",
    "a consequence , making use of the exact asymptotic @xmath6 result ( [ eq_rl_dimscal ] ) , is that the relative difference between @xmath8 and @xmath6 is at most of @xmath94 .",
    "our second argument concerns why @xmath6 must be greater than @xmath8 at all @xmath1 . for the random link tsp there is no triangle inequality , which means that given two edges of a triangle , the third edge is on average longer than it would be for the euclidean tsp . applying this to our lk search , we can expect the link between @xmath169 and @xmath160 closing up the tour to be longer in the random link case than in the euclidean case . thus on average , the lk algorithm will find longer random link tours than euclidean tours .",
    "in fact , this property holds as well for any lk - like algorithm where the method of choosing the @xmath171 and @xmath170 links is generalized .",
    "if the algorithm were to allow _ all _ possibilities for @xmath171 and @xmath170 , we would be sure of obtaining the exact optimum tour , given a long enough search . in that case",
    ", the inequality on the tour lengths found by our algorithm leads directly to @xmath174 .",
    "not surprisingly , the numerical data confirm this inequality at @xmath1 up to 4 ( although one should be cautious when applying the argument at @xmath109 ) .",
    "note also that the inequality in itself implies conjectures ( [ eq_dimscal ] ) and ( [ eq_bertsimas ] ) for the euclidean model , since it supplies precisely the upper bound we need on @xmath8 .",
    "finally let us explain why the relative difference between @xmath6 and @xmath8 should be of @xmath9 .",
    "this involves quantifying the tour length improvement discussed above .",
    "it is clear that any non - optimal tour can be improved to the point where links are mostly between neighbors of low order .",
    "if lk , or a generalized lk - like algorithm , is able to improve the tour further , the relative difference in length will be of @xmath94 ; we see this from ( [ eq_largek ] ) , noting that the neighborhood order @xmath2 is small both before and after the lk search .",
    "now we need to quantify the _ probability _ that lk indeed succeeds in improving the tour .",
    "we may consider the vertex of the lk tadpole graph as executing a random walk , in which case the probability of closing up a tour by a sufficiently short link is equivalent to the probability of the random walk s end - to - end distance being sufficiently small . in that case",
    "it may be shown that , over the course of an lk search , the probability of successfully closing a random link tour minus the probability of successfully closing a euclidean tour scales at large @xmath1 as @xmath175 . from this , we conclude that improvements in the euclidean model are @xmath94 more probable than in the random link model .",
    "now , the relative tour length improvement for the euclidean tsp compared to the random link tsp is simply the relative tour length improvement _ when a better tour is found _ , times the probability of finding a better tour  hence @xmath9 .",
    "if we consider a generalized lk search as described in the previous paragraph , where the algorithm necessarily finds the true optimum , then this result applies to the exact @xmath176s : the relative difference between @xmath6 and @xmath8 will scale at large @xmath1 as @xmath159 .",
    "three comments are in order concerning this surprisingly good accuracy of the random link approximation .",
    "first , the factor @xmath175 is only appropriate for large @xmath1 .",
    "it is not small even for @xmath125 .",
    "( its divergence at @xmath16 is associated with the fact that a two - dimensional random walk returns to its origin with probability 1 . )",
    "we therefore expect the @xmath159 scaling to become apparent only for @xmath177 , beyond the range of our numerical data .",
    "second , we have seen that the coefficient of the @xmath10 term in @xmath6 may be obtained by the cavity method . assuming that this method is correct and that @xmath6 and @xmath8 do indeed converge as @xmath159",
    ", this leads to a particularly strong conjecture for the euclidean tsp : @xmath178\\mbox{.}\\ ] ] third , this type of lk analysis can in fact be extended to many other combinatorial optimization problems , such as the assignment , matching and bipartite matching problems . in these cases , we expect the random link approximation to give rise to a @xmath9 relative error just as in the tsp .",
    "the first goal in our work has been to investigate the finite size scaling of @xmath14 , the optimum euclidean traveling salesman tour length , and to obtain precise estimates for its large @xmath0 behavior .",
    "motivated by a remarkable universality in the @xmath2th nearest neighbor distribution , we have found that under periodic boundary conditions , the convergence of @xmath179 to its limit @xmath8 is described by a series in @xmath57 .",
    "this has enabled us to extract @xmath64 and @xmath180 using numerical simulations at small values of @xmath0 , where errors are easy to control .",
    "furthermore , thanks to a bias - free variance reduction method ( see [ app_statistical ] ) , these estimates are extremely precise .",
    "our second goal has been to examine the random link tsp , where there are no correlations between link lengths .",
    "we have considered it as an approximation to the euclidean tsp , in order to understand better the dimensional scaling of @xmath8 . for small @xmath1 , we have used the cavity method to obtain numerical values of the random link @xmath6 . comparing these with our numerical values for @xmath8 shows that the random link approximation is remarkably good , accurate to within 2% at low dimension . for large @xmath1 , we have solved the cavity equations analytically to give @xmath6 in terms of a @xmath10 series .",
    "we have then argued , using a theoretical analysis of iterative tour improvement algorithms , that the relative difference between @xmath6 and @xmath8 decreases as @xmath159 .",
    "this leads to our conjecture ( [ eq_conjecture_text ] ) on the large @xmath1 behavior of @xmath8 , specifying both its asymptotic form and its leading order correction .",
    "let us conclude with some remaining open questions .",
    "first of all , while the cavity method most likely gives the exact result for the random link tsp , we would be interested in seeing this argued on a more fundamental physical level .",
    "readers with a background in disordered systems will recognize that the underlying assumption of a unique equilibrium state is false in many np - complete problems , and in particular in the spin - glass problem that has inspired the cavity method .",
    "what makes the tsp different ?",
    "second of all , our renormalized random link model provides an alternate approach to finding the @xmath10 coefficient of the power series in @xmath6 , and could prove a useful test of the cavity method s validity . a solution to",
    "the renormalized model using heuristic methods appears within reach .",
    "third of all , the @xmath9 convergence of the random link approximation merits further study , from both numerical and analytical perspectives .",
    "numerically , euclidean simulations at @xmath177 could provide powerful support for the form of the convergence , and thus for our conjecture ( [ eq_conjecture_text ] ) .",
    "analytically , the qualitative arguments presented in section [ sect_rl_estimate ] , based on the lk algorithm , could perhaps be refined by a more quantitative approach .",
    "lastly , it is worth noting that the @xmath9 convergence should apply equally well to the _ distribution _ of link lengths in the optimum tour .",
    "the random link prediction for this distribution can be obtained from the cavity method @xcite ; an interesting test would then be to compare it with simulation results for the true euclidean distribution .",
    "we thank e.  bogomolny , d.s .",
    "johnson , m.  mzard , s.w .",
    "otto and n.  sourlas for fruitful discussions .",

    "we discuss the procedures used to obtain the raw data from which @xmath8 and the finite size scaling coefficients are extracted .",
    "two major problems must be solved in order to get good estimates of @xmath37 .",
    "first , @xmath37 is defined as an ensemble average @xmath181 , but is measured by a numerical average over a finite sample of instances .",
    "the instance - to - instance fluctuations in @xmath14 give rise to a statistical error , which decreases only as the inverse square root of the sample size .",
    "keeping the statistical error down to acceptable levels could require inordinate amounts of computing time .",
    "we therefore find it useful to introduce a variance reduction trick : instead of measuring @xmath14 , we measure @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is a free parameter and @xmath184 can be any quantity which is strongly correlated with @xmath14 .",
    "details are given in [ app_statistical ] .",
    "a second and more basic problem is that it is computationally costly to determine the optimal tour lengths for a large number of instances , precisely because the tsp is an np - complete problem .",
    "the most sophisticated `` branch and cut '' algorithms can take minutes on a workstation to solve a single instance of size @xmath185 to optimality .",
    "however , we do not need to guarantee optimality : the statistical error in @xmath37 already limits the quality of our estimate , and so an additional ( systematic ) error in @xmath14 is admissible as long as it is negligible compared to the statistical error .",
    "we may thus use fast heuristics to measure @xmath14 , rather than exact but slower algorithms .",
    "this is discussed further in [ app_systematic ] .",
    "consider estimating @xmath186 at a given @xmath0 by sampling over many instances .",
    "if we have @xmath187 independent instances , the simplest estimator for @xmath186 is @xmath188 , the numerical average over the @xmath187 instances of the minimum tour lengths .",
    "this estimator has an expected statistical error @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is the instance - to - instance standard deviation of @xmath14 .",
    "now let us define @xmath191 to be the sum , over all cities , of @xmath2th nearest neighbor distances .",
    "@xmath192 is its ensemble average ; in terms of the notation used earlier in the text , @xmath193 .",
    "it has been noted by sourlas @xcite that @xmath14 is strongly correlated with @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "he therefore suggested reducing the statistical error in @xmath36 using the estimator @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the arithmetic mean of @xmath194 , @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the ensemble average @xmath199 can be calculated analytically from ( [ eq_nn ] ) , and so the variance of @xmath200 comes from fluctuations in the ratio @xmath201 . if @xmath14 were a constant factor times @xmath198 , this estimator would of course be perfect , i.e. , it would have zero variance .",
    "this is not the case , however , and furthermore the use of a ratio biases the sourlas estimator : its true mathematical expectation value differs from @xmath186 by @xmath202 . to improve upon this",
    ", we have introduced our own bias - free estimator @xcite : @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the arithmetic mean of @xmath194 and @xmath195 , and @xmath183 is a free parameter .",
    "our estimator has a reduced variance because @xmath14 and @xmath204 are correlated .",
    "it is easy to show that the variance of @xmath205 is minimized at a unique value of @xmath183 , @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the correlation coefficient of @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "the variance then becomes @xmath210 / m$ ] .",
    "empirically , we have found this variance reduction procedure to be quite effective , since @xmath211 at @xmath16 and @xmath212 at @xmath17 .",
    "the statistical error is thus reduced by about a factor of 3 ; this means that for a given error , computing time is reduced by about a factor of 10 .",
    "our procedure for estimating @xmath14 at a given instance involves running a good heuristic @xmath213 times from random starts on that instance , and taking the best tour length found in those @xmath213 trials .",
    "the expected systematic error can be found from the frequencies with which each local optimum appears in a large number of test trials .",
    "( this large number must be much greater than @xmath213 , the actual number of trials used in production runs . )",
    "the measurement is performed on a sufficiently large sample of instances , from which we extract the _ average _ size of the systematic error in @xmath186 as a function of @xmath213 .",
    "we have found that in practice , this error is dominated by those infrequent instances where a sub - optimal tour is obtained with the highest frequency .",
    "as @xmath0 increases , the probability of not finding the true optimum increases rather fast ; for a given heuristic , it is thus necessary to increase @xmath213 with @xmath0 in such a way that the systematic error remains much smaller than the statistical error . if the heuristic is not powerful enough , @xmath213 will be too large for the computational resources .",
    "for our purposes , we have found that the lin - kernighan heuristic @xcite is powerful enough for the smaller values of @xmath0 ( @xmath58 ) . for @xmath214",
    ", it was more efficient to switch to chained local optimization ( clo ) @xcite , a more powerful heuristic which can be thought of as a generalization of simulated annealing .",
    "( when the temperature parameter is set to zero so that no up - hill moves are accepted , as was the case for our runs , clo with embedded lin - kernighan is called `` iterated lin - kernighan '' @xcite . ) with these choices , using in two dimensions @xmath215 for @xmath216 ( lk ) , @xmath217 for @xmath59 and @xmath218 for @xmath60 ( clo ) , we have kept systematic errors to under 10% of the statistical errors",
    ".        given two sets of @xmath0 points @xmath220 and @xmath221 in @xmath1-dimensional euclidean space , the bipartite matching ( bm ) problem asks for the minimum matching cost @xmath222 between the @xmath223s and the @xmath224s , with the constraint that only links of the form @xmath225 are allowed .",
    "the cost of a matching is equal to the sum of the distances between matched pairs of points . when points @xmath223 and @xmath224 are chosen at random in a @xmath1-dimensional unit hypercube , it is natural to expect @xmath226 to be self - averaging as @xmath31 . to date , a proof of this property has not been given , even though the self - averaging of the analogous quantity in the more general matching problem ( where links @xmath227 and @xmath228 are allowed as well ) can be shown at all @xmath1 in essentially the same way as for the tsp , following arguments developed by steele @xcite .",
    "for @xmath109 , it is in fact known that self - averaging _ fails _ in the bm . for large @xmath1 , however , let us assume that @xmath226 does converge to some @xmath229 in the large @xmath0 limit .",
