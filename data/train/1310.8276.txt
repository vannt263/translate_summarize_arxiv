    "now , the transversal to @xmath152 lies in the free homotopy class of the curve formed by taking these four altitudes and two small arcs on @xmath152 joining the appropriate ends of these copies of @xmath156 . by the constraint placed on the twist parameters , these two smaller arcs have total length less than @xmath167 .",
    "thus , the length of the transversal @xmath150 is bounded above by @xmath168 now suppose that the surface @xmath1 has a cusps .",
    "we again look a pair of pants @xmath47 with boundary geodesics @xmath66 and @xmath50 so that @xmath47 has a cusp .",
    "then for both @xmath66 and @xmath50 , there exists a unique perpendicular geodesic which goes out the cusp , @xmath169 and @xmath170 respectively . adding the common perpendiculars @xmath75 from @xmath66 to @xmath50 and @xmath156 from @xmath66 to @xmath170",
    ", we decompose the front half of @xmath47 into a geodesic pentagon and a geodesic trirectangle with one ideal point . as @xmath47",
    "is made from the pasting of two isometric degenerate hexagons , we have an isometric construction on the opposite side of @xmath47 .",
    "allow @xmath159 to be the segment on @xmath66 of length @xmath171 on the front half of @xmath47 .",
    "if @xmath159 lies in the geodesic pentagon , then we can proceed exactly as above .",
    "if @xmath159 lies in the trirectangle , however , then we can use the standard trigonometric fact ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 2.3.1 ( i ) ) to conclude that @xmath172 as @xmath173 for all @xmath56 , we have that @xmath174 and we can bound the length of the transversal via the same procedure as above . for two cusps , we just create the analogous pair of geodesic trirectangles on the surface and arrive at the same bound .        as @xmath1 and @xmath25",
    "are length isospectral , the lengths of the transversals bounded in the previous proposition must appear in the spectrum of @xmath1 . by the estimate in the previous section on length spectrum growth rate ( proposition 4.3 ) , there are at most @xmath175 possible lengths in this portion of the spectrum and hence this many choices for the length of each transversal on @xmath25 .",
    "as the length of the transversal at a geodesic in our pants decomposition determines the twist parameter up to 2 possible values , we obtain the following bound after accounting for the @xmath34 geodesics in the pants decomposition :    the number of possible twist parameters for a surface length isospectral to a hyperbolic surface @xmath1 with bers constant @xmath15 and lower bound on systole length @xmath7 based on graph @xmath37 and with fixed length parameters @xmath98 is bounded above by @xmath176 .",
    "multiplying together the bounds for the graphs and length and twist parameters , we obtain the desired result .",
    "the preceding proof is adapted from the first half of the proof of theorem 1.1 in buser @xcite and arose from attempts to refine this proof .",
    "while there is room to tighten the constants used in buser s approximations , any significant improvement to the asympototics of the bound seems unlikely with his technology unless the asymptotics on the bers constant for closed surfaces is improved .",
    "the proof has a factor of @xmath177 built in to account for the different graphs corresponding to the pants decompositions , rendering improvement beyond these asymptotics impossible .",
    "the factor of the genus squared in the exponent of buser s bound comes from the same process described above : the bers constant depends on the genus , the length spectrum growth rate exponentiates this constant , and accounting for the number of geodesics in the pants decomposition introduces another factor of the genus .",
    "thus , improvement in the bers constant results directly in the improvement of the bound .",
    "+ the bound produced here is heavily dependent upon our bound on systole length .",
    "it is a consequence of the collar theorem that as a simple closed geodesic shrinks , it has an embedded cylinder of increasing length about it on the surface .",
    "this results in the lengthening of the transverse curve to the geodesic .",
    "thus , allowing for arbitrarily short geodesics results in an unbounded collection of transverse curves and the proof presented here is no longer valid .",
    "running buser s proof for the general case with just the improved bers constant would only improve the coefficient of @xmath178 to about 679 due to the complications arising from the short geodesics .",
    "this paper was written during the mathematics research experience for undergraduates at the university of michigan .",
    "i would like to thank my advisors richard canary and benjamin linowitz for their patience and insight , as well as the university of michigan mathematics department for running such a rewarding reu program ."
