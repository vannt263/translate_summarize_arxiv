    "despite the overwhelming evidence for the existence of dark matter in our universe , very little is known about its properties from the point of view of particle physics .",
    "one of the most striking properties of the particles comprising the dark matter is their longevity , evidenced by their survival from production in the early universe to the present day . among the hundreds of matter particles",
    "which have been produced and studied over the last century at accelerators , only very few have lifetimes on a cosmological scale : the proton , the electron and the three neutrinos .",
    "the longevity of the electron , which is the lightest charged particle , can be attributed to the conservation of electric charge .",
    "the longevity of the lightest neutrino , which is also the lightest fermion , is due to lorentz symmetry .",
    "the longevity of the other two neutrinos , which can decay into the lightest neutrino and a photon , is because of their tiny masses .",
    "lastly , the longevity of the proton can be attributed to the accidental conservation of baryon number in the renormalizable standard model lagrangian , which might be broken by higher - dimensional operators .",
    "however , no general principle is known which would necessitate a cosmologically long dark matter lifetime . on the contrary",
    ", the longevity of the dark matter particle can only be understood within concrete models of dark matter , and is usually due to additional symmetries imposed from the start .    in the absence of a fundamental reason to guarantee the absolute stability of the dark matter particle ,",
    "it is important to analyze the potential signatures of the decay of dark matter particles and the constraints on the dark matter lifetime which follow from cosmic - ray measurements .",
    "generally , indirect constraints on dark matter stability can be inferred from observations of gamma rays  @xcite , neutrinos  @xcite , electrons / positrons  @xcite and antiprotons / antideuterons  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the hadronic decay modes of general dark matter candidates .",
    "we use the measurements of the antiproton - to - proton fraction performed with the pamela satellite instrument  @xcite to constrain the minimum dark matter lifetime in hadronic decay modes , examining a number of possibilities for the coupling of the dark matter particle to the standard model particles .",
    "we also argue that the partial lifetime for the decay of dark matter particles into a quark ",
    "antiquark pair and a neutral fermion , @xmath0 , can also be constrained using gamma - ray observations ; more concretely via searches for monoenergetic gamma - rays which can be generated at the quantum level by radiating photons from virtual quarks . instead of photons",
    ", weak gauge bosons can also be generated at next - to - leading order in this manner , even in models where the dark matter does not decay hadronically at leading order .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : antiproton_production ] we review the production and propagation of antiprotons in the galaxy .",
    "we then derive constraints on the partial dark matter lifetime in various hadronic decay modes in section  [ sec : tree_level ] . in section  [ sec : gamma_rays ] we discuss the generation of monochromatic gamma rays from decays into quarks and compare the resulting constraints with those from cosmic - ray antiprotons .",
    "the production of antiprotons from radiative decays into weak gauge bosons is analyzed in section  [ sec : weak_gauge_bosons ] .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "antiprotons are a rare component of the cosmic radiation ( at 10 gev kinetic energy about one antiproton is observed for every @xmath1 protons  @xcite ) .",
    "these cosmic antiprotons are believed to be overwhelmingly or exclusively of secondary origin by spallation of primary cosmic rays on interstellar gas , a hypothesis which is in good quantitative agreement with observations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the cosmic - ray antiproton flux constitutes a sensitive probe for particle production in the galaxy from exotic sources like dark matter decay . in this section",
    "we briefly review the production and propagation in the galaxy of antiprotons from dark matter decay .    given a population of dark matter particles with mass @xmath2 and lifetime @xmath3 , the production rate of antiprotons per unit",
    "energy and unit volume at a position @xmath4 with respect to the center of the galaxy is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy spectrum of antiprotons produced in the decay and @xmath7 is the density profile of the distribution of dark matter in the milky way halo . for definiteness we will adopt the spherically symmetric navarro - frenk - white halo density profile  @xcite : @xmath8 ^ 2}\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , which corresponds to a local dark matter density of @xmath11  @xcite . due to the linear dependence on the dark matter density , different choices for the halo profile yield very similar constraints  @xcite .    after being produced in the milky way halo ,",
    "antiprotons propagate through the galaxy and its diffusive magnetic halo in a rather complicated manner before reaching the earth .",
    "cosmic - ray propagation in the galaxy is commonly described using a stationary two - zone diffusion model with cylindrical boundary conditions  @xcite . due to the relatively large antiproton mass",
    ", we can neglect energy losses as well as reacceleration effects in our treatment  @xcite .",
    "we furthermore neglect catastrophic losses from antiproton annihilation with ordinary matter in the galactic disk since they have a negligible effect on the total antiproton flux . under these approximations , the number density @xmath12 of antiprotons per unit",
    "kinetic energy @xmath13 satisfies the following transport equation : @xmath14 + q_{\\bar p}(t,\\vec{r})\\;.    \\label{transport}\\ ] ]    the first term on the right - hand side of the transport equation is the diffusion term , which accounts for the propagation through the tangled galactic magnetic field .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath15 is assumed to be constant throughout the diffusion zone and is parametrized by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the antiproton speed as a fraction of the speed of light and @xmath18 is the rigidity of the particle , which is defined as the momentum in gev per unit charge , @xmath19 .",
    "the second term is the convection term , which accounts for the drift of antiprotons away from the disk induced by the milky way s galactic wind .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we will assume that it has axial direction and that it is constant inside the diffusion region above and below the galactic disk : @xmath20 .",
    "lastly , @xmath21 is the source term of cosmic antiprotons as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : source - term ] ) .",
    "the solution of the transport equation at the heliospheric boundary at our position in the galaxy , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , can be formally expressed by the convolution @xmath24 where @xmath25 , with @xmath26 being the proton mass .",
    "analytical and numerical expressions for the green s function @xmath27 derived within the semi - analytical framework described above can be found in  @xcite .    given the number density ,",
    "the flux of primary antiprotons from dark matter decay at the heliospheric boundary is finally given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the speed of the antiprotons as a function of their kinetic energy .",
    "the computation of the local antiproton flux suffers from various sources of uncertainty .",
    "the most important one stems from the choice of the propagation parameters that enter in the transport equation ( the normalization of the diffusion coefficient , the power - law index of the rigidity , the height of the diffusion zone and the speed of the convective wind ) .",
    "this uncertainty in the model parameters amounts to as much as two orders of magnitude . in view of this large uncertainty",
    "we calculate our constraints for the full range of parameters compatible with observations .",
    "in contrast , the uncertainties on the choice of the dark matter halo profile and the local dark matter density are subdominant , and amount at most to a factor of order one  @xcite . due to the linear dependence of the fluxes on the dark matter density , our constraints",
    "can easily be rescaled to other values .",
    "therefore , we will just present results for the navarro - frenk - white halo profile with @xmath11 , whereas we will present the entire range of results for three different propagation models that are consistent with the observed boron - to - carbon ( b / c ) ratio and that give the maximum ( max ) , medium ( med ) and minimum ( min ) antiproton flux  @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameters are summarized in tab .",
    "[ tab : param - antiproton ] .",
    ".[tab : param - antiproton ] astrophysical parameters compatible with the observed b / c ratio that yield the minimum ( min ) , medium ( med ) and maximum ( max ) flux of antiprotons  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      with @xmath30 .",
    "we show the benchmark points from table  [ tab : benchmarks ] for comparison.,width=377 ]      analogously to the fermionic case , we also consider a scalar dark matter particle that decays leptonically via its tree level coupling to charged leptons , @xmath32 . at the one - loop level",
    ", the dark matter can also decay into a pair of gauge bosons .",
    "the rate for the loop - induced decay into a pair of photons , @xmath33 , has been discussed in the context of gamma - ray line searches in ref .",
    "antiprotons are produced in the loop - induced decays involving the massive gauge bosons .",
    "the decay rate for the loop - induced process @xmath34 can be adapted , _",
    "e.g. _ , from the results in refs .  @xcite . for the branching ratio",
    ", we find in the limit @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this radiative decay mode is suppressed because of the necessary helicity flip of the lepton in the loop .",
    "analogously , the decays @xmath39 and @xmath40 are in principle allowed .",
    "we do not examine these decay modes in detail since they are suppressed in the same manner .",
    "we have presented a general model - independent analysis of the cosmic - ray antiproton constraints on the partial dark matter lifetime in hadronic decay modes for the lowest - order decays allowed by lorentz and gauge invariance . in particular , we have investigated the possible two - body decay modes for fermionic and scalar dark matter particles , as well as three - body decays into a pair of quarks and a neutral particle ( for example , a neutrino ) for majorana dark matter particles .",
    "for the three - body decay we have paid special attention to the resulting energy spectra , which can differ slightly depending on whether the decay is mediated by a scalar or a vector particle , and whether the neutral particle produced in the final state is nearly massless or nearly degenerate with the dark matter particle . employing a semi - analytical model of cosmic - ray propagation",
    "we have scanned the mass  lifetime parameter space over several orders of magnitude , and have derived lower limits on the lifetime for three representative sets of propagation parameters from the pamela measurement of the antiproton - to - proton ratio .",
    "we have also examined kinematic enhancement of radiative decays as well as the production of monochromatic gamma rays .",
    "radiative decays into photons induced at next - to - leading order by tree - level decay into the electrically charged quarks provide an interesting complementarity to the antiproton constraints .",
    "finally , we have discussed antiproton constraints arising from loop - induced decays into weak gauge bosons for leptophilic dark matter .",
