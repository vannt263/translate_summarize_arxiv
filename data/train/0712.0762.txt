    "on a broad perspective , any self - gravitating group of stars whose members share common initial conditions can be classified as a star cluster . in this definition",
    "fit the embedded , open and globular clusters ( ocs and gcs , respectively ) , as well as the oc remnants .",
    "those objects span a wide range of ages , masses and luminosities , among other parameters .",
    "while the upper limit to the gc population may be close to 200 members ( e.g. @xcite ) , the oc ( as well as embedded and remnants ) census , which at this moment amounts to more than @xmath1 according to the webda database , is far from complete , especially at the faint - end of the luminosity distribution ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "besides , because of observational limitations associated with cluster / background contrast , we actually observe a very small fraction of the ocs in the galaxy ( @xcite ) . in this context ,",
    "derivation of astrophysical parameters of as yet unknown star clusters represents an important step to better define their statistical properties .",
    "irrespective of the initial mass , star clusters evolve dynamically because of the combination of internal and external processes .",
    "the main contributors to the internal processes are the mass loss during stellar evolution , mass segregation and evaporation , while for the external ones are tidal interactions with the disk and galactic bulge , and collisions with giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "consequently , the cluster structure changes significantly with age , to the point that most ( especially less - massive ones ) end up completely dissolved in the galactic stellar field ( e.g. @xcite ) or as poorly - populated remnants ( e.g. @xcite ) .    probably reflecting the galactocentric - dependence of most of the disruptive effects",
    ", the galaxy presents a spatial asymmetry in the age - distribution of ocs .",
    "indeed , @xcite noted that ocs older than @xmath2gyr tended to be concentrated towards the anti - centre , a region with a low density of gmcs . in this sense , the combined effect of tidal field and encounters with gmcs has been invoked to explain the lack of old ocs in the solar neighbourhood ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "near the solar circle most ocs appear to dissolve on a time - scale shorter than @xmath3gyr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , consistent with the disruption time - scales of @xmath4 for nearby clusters with mass in the range @xmath5 ( @xcite ) . in more central parts , interactions with the disk ,",
    "the enhanced tidal pull of the galactic bulge , and the high frequency of collisions with gmcs tend to destroy the poorly - populated ocs on a time - scale of a few @xmath6myr ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in general terms",
    ", the net effect of tidal interactions on a star cluster over long periods is to increase the thermal energy . on average ,",
    "member stars gain more kinetic energy after each event , leading to large - scale mass segregation and an increase in the evaporation rate .",
    "central tidal fields ( at galactocentric distances @xmath7pc ) can dissolve a massive star cluster in a very short time , @xmath8myr ( @xcite ) . a discussion on the disruptive processes and associated time - scales can be found in bonatto & bica ( 2007a , and references therein ) .",
    "besides dynamical evolution - related effects , observational completeness also plays an important rle to explain the scarcity of open clusters in the inner galaxy .",
    "high absorption and crowding in fields dominated by disk and bulge stars are expected to significantly decrease completeness , especially at the faint - end of the oc luminosity distribution .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that a large fraction of the intrinsically faint and/or distant ocs must be drowned in the field , particularly in bulge / disk directions .",
    "based on the spatial distribution of the galactic ocs and the related observational completeness , @xcite found that tidal disruption may be significant for ocs located at distances @xmath9kpc inside the solar circle .    on the observational viewpoint",
    ", the arguments discussed above also reflect the importance of deep , all - sky surveys to detect and characterise new star clusters , especially in central directions .",
    "such discoveries , in turn , can help constrain the galactic tidal disruption efficiency , improve statistics of the oc parameter space , and better define their age - distribution function inside the solar circle .",
    "recently , @xcite published a catalogue of 1021 star cluster candidates ( hereafter fsr objects ) for @xmath10 and all galactic longitudes , detected by means of an automated algorithm applied to the 2mass database .",
    "they basically worked with stellar number - densities , identifying regions with overdensities with respect to the surroundings .",
    "each overdensity region was classified according to a quality flag , 0 and 1 representing the most probable star clusters , while the 5 and 6 flags may be related to field fluctuations .",
    "nevertheless , we point out that cmds are necessary to try to distinguish star clusters from field density fluctuations .",
    "the fsr catalogue has already produced two new gcs , fsr1735 ( @xcite ) and fsr1767 ( @xcite ) , as well as the probable gc fsr584 ( @xcite ) .",
    "other prominent clusters to visual inspection on the 2mass atlas , and later confirmed to be old open clusters , are fsr1744 , fsr89 and fsr31 ( @xcite ) , and fsr190 ( @xcite ) .",
    "considering the above discoveries , it is fundamental to systematically explore the fsr catalogue guided by the quality flags of the overdensities to look for star clusters .",
    "our approach is based on 2mass photometry , on which we apply a field - star decontamination algorithm ( @xcite ) that is essential to disentangle physical from field cmd sequences .",
    "we also take into account properties of the stellar radial density profiles .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "[ targets ] we present fundamental data of the sample targets . in sect .",
    "[ photpar ] we present the 2mass photometry and discuss the methods employed in the cmd analyses , especially the field - star decontamination . in sect .",
    "[ rdps ] we analyse the stellar radial density profiles and derive structural parameters of the confirmed star clusters . in sect .",
    "[ disc ] we discuss the nature of the targets . concluding remarks",
    "are given in sect .",
    "[ conclu ] .",
    "for the present study we selected all cluster candidates with quality flags 0 and 1 basically projected against the bulge ( @xmath0 ) , taken from both tables of probable and possible candidates ( @xcite ) .",
    "information on the resulting candidate sample are listed in table  [ tab1 ] , where we also include the core and tidal radii measured by @xcite on the 2mass  images by means of a @xcite profile fit .",
    "the fsr classification as probable or possible star cluster , as well as the quality flag are given .",
    "the targets in table  [ tab1 ] are organised into three groups according to the nature implied by this work ( sect .",
    "[ disc ] ) .",
    ".general data on the fsr star cluster candidates [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table notes .",
    "@xmath11 : fsr1644 ; @xmath12 : fsr1723 . col .  2 : arcmin to parsec scale . to minimise degrees of freedom in rdp fits with the king - like profile ( see text ) , @xmath13 was kept fixed ( measured in the respective comparison fields ) while @xmath14 and  were allowed to vary .",
    "col .  5 : cluster / background density contrast ( @xmath15 ) , measured in colour - magnitude filtered rdps .",
    "we also provide in col .  7 of table  [ tab4 ] the cluster limiting radius and uncertainty , which are estimated by comparing the rdp ( taking into account fluctuations ) with the background level",
    ". corresponds to the distance from the cluster centre where rdp and background become statistically indistinguishable . for practical purposes ,",
    "most of the cluster stars are contained within @xmath16 .",
    "the limiting radius should not be mistaken for the tidal radius ; the latter values are usually derived from king ( or other analytical functions ) fits to rdps , which depend on wide surrounding fields and as small as possible poisson errors ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast ,  comes from a visual comparison of the rdp and background level .",
    "the empirical determination of a cluster - limiting radius depends on the relative levels of rdp and background ( and respective fluctuations ) .",
    "thus , dynamical evolution may indirectly affect the measurement of the limiting radius .",
    "since mass segregation preferentially drives low - mass stars to the outer parts of clusters , the cluster / background contrast in these regions tends to lower as clusters age . as an observational consequence , smaller values of limiting radii should be measured , especially for clusters in dense fields .",
    "however , simulations of king - like ocs ( @xcite ) show that , provided not exceedingly high , background levels may produce limiting radii underestimated by about 1020% .",
    "the core radius , on the other hand , is almost insensitive to background levels ( @xcite ) .",
    "this occurs because  results from fitting the king - like profile to a distribution of rdp points , which minimises background effects .",
    "the rdps of the cases with uncertain cmd morphology are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . except for fsr10 , which suffers from low - number statistics ,",
    "the remaining rdps suggest the presence of a star cluster .    finally , in fig .  [ fig8 ]",
    "we show the rdps of the remaining targets . a narrow excess in the stellar density profile near the centre is present in all cases , but they are quite different from a king - like profile ( e.g. fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "following the photometric ( sect .",
    "[ photpar ] ) and rdp ( sect .",
    "[ rdps ] ) analyses , the 20 fsr overdensity / star cluster candidates dealt with in this paper can be split into the three distinct groups discussed below .",
    "objects in the first group have well - defined decontaminated cmd sequences ( figs .  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) with relatively high values of the parameter , both considering magnitude bins ( table  [ tabstat ] ) and the integrated one ( table  [ tab2 ] ) , as well as king - like rdps ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) . in most cases , the statistical significance of the decontaminated number of probable member stars , in individual magnitude bins , is @xmath17 with respect to fluctuations in the observed number of stars .",
    "astrophysical parameters ( age , distance , reddening , core and limiting radii ) could be measured for these clusters .",
    "they are fsr70 , fsr124 , fsr133 , fsr1644 , fsr1723 and fsr1737 .",
    "the average value of  is @xmath18 .",
    "fsr70 : the decontaminated cmd ( @xmath19 ) is typical of an old cluster . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we tentatively applied the 5gyr isochrone , which resulted in a distance from the sun of @xmath20kpc , and the galactocentric distance @xmath21kpc .",
    "the rdp , with a density contrast @xmath22 , produced the structural parameters @xmath23pc and @xmath24pc . within uncertainties",
    ", the present  value agrees with that computed by @xcite ( table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "fsr124 : the presence of an intermediate - age oc was already suggested by the observed cmd . with @xmath19 in the decontaminated cmd , we derived the age @xmath25gyr , @xmath26kpc and @xmath27kpc . from the highly contrasted rdp ( @xmath28 ) we derived @xmath29pc and @xmath30pc",
    ". in this case",
    "our value of  is @xmath31 that in @xcite .",
    "fsr133 : this oc presents the highest reddening value ( @xmath32 ) among the present sample .",
    "it appears to be the most populous as well , with the decontaminated @xmath33 .",
    "we found the age @xmath34myr , @xmath35kpc and @xmath36kpc . from the rdp ( @xmath37 )",
    "we derived @xmath38pc ( @xmath39 that in @xcite ) and @xmath40pc .",
    "harvard8 , cr268 = fsr1644 : the decontamination ( @xmath41 ) was essential to uncover this oc with the age @xmath34myr , at @xmath35kpc and @xmath42kpc . from the rdp ( @xmath43 ) we derived @xmath44pc ( @xmath39 that in @xcite ) and @xmath45pc .",
    "webda provides for this optical cluster under the designation cr268 , @xmath46 , @xmath47kpc and the age 0.57gyr , in excellent agreement with the present work ( table  [ tab2 ] ) .    eso275sc1 = fsr1723 : an oc of age @xmath48gyr , at @xmath49kpc and @xmath50kpc , clearly stands out both in the observed and decontaminated ( @xmath51 ) cmds , which presents the lowest reddening ( @xmath52 ) among the sample .",
    "the king - like rdp ( @xmath53 ) is characterised by @xmath54pc ( similar to that in @xcite ) and @xmath55pc .",
    "fsr1737 : another case of an old oc whose decontaminated cmd ( @xmath56 ) suggests an age of 5gyr , or older . in the case of 5gyr , we estimated @xmath57kpc and @xmath58kpc .",
    "its rdp ( @xmath59 ) implies @xmath60pc ( @xmath39 that in @xcite ) and @xmath61pc .      in general ,",
    "targets of the second group have less defined decontaminated cmd sequences than those in the first group , which is consistent with the lower - level of the  parameter in magnitude bins , which reaches a statistical significance of @xmath62 ; however , their integrated   are , on average , of the same order ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "they are fsr10 , fsr98 , fsr1740 , fsr1769 and fsr1754 .",
    "cluster sequences are suggested by the decontaminated cmds ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) , e.g. giant clump and the top of the ms .",
    "rdps of the objects in this group ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) also suggest star clusters , although the large error bars of fsr10 reflect the low - number statistics .",
    "fsr1754 is an interesting case whose decontaminated cmd presents two sequences , a blue one with @xmath19 and a more populous red one with @xmath64 .",
    "the former may be from an intermediate - age cluster ( iac ) , while the latter might correspond to an old cluster .",
    "rdps extracted from both sequences separately ( fig .  [ fig7 ] ) also suggest star clusters .",
    "we point out that the field of fsr1754 contains the oc ngc6318 , at @xmath65 from the centre ( webda ) , which can be seen in the rdp of fsr1754 as a `` bump '' on the wing ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "decontaminated cmds and rdps taken together suggest that the above objects might be old clusters which require deeper observations .",
    "fsr10 , on the other hand , may be an iac .",
    "deeper photometry is essential in most cases , especially for old ocs for which the to is close to the 2mass limiting magnitude . in this context , we would recommend also that the same applies to fsr70 and fsr1737 ( sect .",
    "[ confclus ] ) , for a better definition of the to region and , consequently , the age and distance from the sun .",
    "decontaminated cmds of this group have -values significantly lower than those of the star clusters ( sect .",
    "[ confclus ] ) and uncertain cases ( sect .  [ dubcases ] ) . indeed ,",
    "the average integrated  is @xmath66 , while the statistical significance of the probable member stars in individual magnitude bins is below the @xmath67 level .",
    "the fact that they have @xmath68 is consistent with the method employed by @xcite to detect overdensities .",
    "however , in most cases the rdp excess is very narrow , restricted to the first bins , quite different from a king - like profile ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .",
    "the third group has essentially featureless ( observed and decontaminated ) cmds , and rdps with important deviations from cluster - like profiles .",
    "they appear to be @xmath69 fluctuations of the dense stellar field over which these objects are projected .",
    "to put the present fsr ocs into perspective we compare in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] their astrophysical parameters with those measured in ocs in different environments .",
    "we consider _",
    "( i ) _ a sample of bright nearby ocs ( @xcite ) , including the two young ocs ngc6611 ( @xcite ) and ngc4755 ( @xcite ) , _ ( ii ) _ ocs projected against the central parts of the galaxy ( @xcite ) , and _ ( iii ) _ the recently analysed ocs fsr1744 , fsr89 and fsr31 ( @xcite ) , which are similarly projected against the central parts of the galaxy as the present fsr cluster sample _ ( iv _ ) .",
    "ocs in sample _",
    "( i ) _ have ages in the range @xmath70 and galactocentric distances in the range @xmath71 .",
    "ngc6611 has @xmath72myr and @xmath73kpc , and ngc4755 has @xmath74myr and @xmath75kpc .",
    "( ii ) _ ocs are characterised by @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "fsr1744 , fsr89 and fsr31 are gyr - class ocs at @xmath78 .",
    "core and limiting radii of the ocs in samples _",
    "( i ) _ and _ ( ii ) _ are almost linearly related by @xmath79 ( panel ( a ) ) , which suggests a similar scaling in both kinds of radii , in the sense that on average , larger clusters tend to have larger cores , at least for @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "linear relations between oc core and limiting radii were also found by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . however , about @xmath82 of the ocs in samples _ ( iii ) _ and _ ( iv ) _ do not follow that relation , which suggests that they are either intrinsically small or have suffered important evaporation effects ( see below )",
    ". the core and limiting radii of fsr124 and fsr1723 are consistent with the relation at the @xmath83 level .",
    "a dependence of oc size on galactocentric distance is implied by panel ( b ) , as previously suggested by @xcite and @xcite . in this context , the limiting radii of the present fsr ocs are roughly consistent with their positions in the galaxy , especially fsr1737 , the innermost oc of the sample .",
    "since core and limiting radii appear to be linearly related ( panel a ) , a similar conclusion applies to the core radius .",
    "part of this relation may be primordial , in the sense that the higher density of molecular gas in central galactic regions may have produced clusters with smaller core radii , as suggested by @xcite to explain the increase of gc radii with galactocentric distance .",
    "in addition , there is the possibility that the core size may also be a function of the binary fraction and its evolution with age , so that loss of stars may not be the only process to determine sizes .",
    "core and limiting radii are compared with cluster age in panels ( c ) and",
    "( d ) , respectively . this relationship is intimately related to cluster survival / dissociation rates . both kinds of radii present a similar dependence on age , in which part of the clusters expand with time , while some seem to shrink .",
    "the bifurcation occurs at @xmath84gyr . except for fsr133 ( and perhaps , fsr1737 )",
    ", the remaining fsr ocs have core radii typical of the small ocs in the lower branch ; the limiting radii , on the other hand , locate in the lower branch .",
    "with respect to the astrophysical parameters discussed above , the present fsr star clusters can be taken as similar objects as fsr1744 , fsr89 and fsr31 ( @xcite ) . in that study we interpreted the relatively small radii of the latter ocs as resulting from the enhanced dynamical evolution combined to low - contrast .",
    "effects such as the tidal pull of the galactic bulge , frequency of collisions with giant molecular clouds and spiral arms , low - mass star evaporation and ejection , which are more important in the inner galaxy , tend to accelerate the dynamical evolution , especially of low - mass star clusters ( @xcite , and references therein ) . as a result , the mass of the ocs decreases with time .",
    "one consequence of the mass segregation associated to the dynamical evolution is the large - scale transfer of low - mass stars towards the external parts , which reduces the surface brightness at large radii . when projected against the central parts of the galaxy , such star clusters ( as well as the poorly - populated ones ) suffer from low - contrast effects , especially in the external parts .",
    "@xcite found that low contrast may underestimate the limiting radii of centrally projected ocs by about @xmath85 .",
    "the core radii , on the other hand , are not affected .",
    "thus , the small sizes of the present fsr clusters derived here appear to be related to dynamical effects .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we show the spatial distribution in the galactic plane of the present fsr ocs , compared to that of the ocs in the webda database .",
    "we consider the age ranges @xmath86gyr , @xmath87gyr and @xmath88gyr .",
    "fsr31 , fsr89 and fsr1744 are also shown .",
    "old ocs are found preferentially outside the solar circle , and the inner galaxy contains few ocs so far detected . the interesting point here is whether inner galaxy clusters can not be observed because of strong absorption and crowding , or have been systematically dissolved by the different tidal effects combined ( @xcite , and references therein ) . in this context ,",
    "the more ocs are identified ( with their astrophysical parameters derived ) in the central parts , the more constraints can be established to settle this issue .",
    "the discovery of new star clusters in the galaxy , and the derivation of their astrophysical parameters , provide important information that , in turn , can be used in a variety of other studies related to the star formation and evolution processes , dynamics of n - body systems , disruption time scales , the geometry of the galaxy , among others .    in this work we selected a sample of star cluster candidates projected nearly towards the dense stellar field of the bulge ( @xmath89 , @xmath90 ) , from the catalogue of @xcite .",
    "they classified them as probable and possible star clusters , with quality flag 0 or 1. the resulting 20 targets were analysed with 2mass photometry by means of field - star decontaminated colour - magnitude diagrams , colour - magnitude filters and stellar radial density profiles .",
    "of the 20 overdensities , 6 resulted with cluster - like cmds and king - like rdps ( among these are the already catalogued open clusters harvard8=cr268 , and eso275sc1 ) .",
    "these are star clusters with ages in the range 0.6gyr to @xmath91gyr , at distances from the sun @xmath92 , and galactocentric distances @xmath93 .",
    "five others have cmds and rdps that suggest old star clusters , but they require deeper photometry to establish their nature .",
    "some of the uncertain cases might be globular clusters , considering the high value of the field - star decontaminated cmd density parameter  and the similarity with the bulge cmd .",
    "the remaining 9 overdensities are likely fluctuations of the associated dense stellar field .    considering the above numbers , the fraction of overdensities that turned out to be star cluster ( @xmath94 )",
    "can be put in the range @xmath95 .",
    "the upper limit agrees with the @xmath96 estimated by @xcite .    systematic surveys such as that of @xcite are important to detect new star cluster candidates throughout the galaxy .",
    "nevertheless , works like the present one , that rely upon field - star decontaminated cmds and stellar radial profiles , are fundamental to probe the nature of such candidates , especially those projected against dense stellar fields .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for helpful suggestions . we acknowledge partial support from cnpq ( brazil ) .",
    "this research has made use of the webda database , operated at the institute for astronomy of the university of vienna ."
