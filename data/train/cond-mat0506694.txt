    "in addition , impurity phase transitions have been argued to describe aspects of so - called local quantum criticality in correlated lattice systems . here ,",
    "the framework of dynamical mean - field theory is employed to map , e.g. , the kondo lattice model onto a single - impurity bose - fermi kondo model supplemented by self - consistency conditions , for details see ref .  .",
    "diverse techniques have been used to investigate impurity phase transitions , ranging from static and dynamic large-@xmath0 calculations @xcite , conformal field theory @xcite , perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) @xcite and the local - moment approach @xcite to various numerical methods . in particular ,",
