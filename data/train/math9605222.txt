    "= 3.0 in    in this paper , we prove the existence of a complete , embedded , singly periodic minimal surface , whose quotient by vertical translations has genus one and two ends .",
    "the existence of this surface was announced in @xcite and its significance discussed in @xcite .",
    "its ends in the quotient are asymptotic to one full turn of the helicoid , and , like the helicoid , it contains a vertical line .",
    "modulo vertical translations , it has two parallel horizontal lines crossing the vertical axis .",
    "the nontrivial symmetries of the surface , modulo vertical translations , consist of : @xmath0 rotation about the vertical line ; @xmath0 rotation about the horizontal lines ( the same symmetry ) ; and their composition  a @xmath0 rotation about a line , orthogonal to the lines on the surface , and passing through a common axis point .",
    "this line meets the surface orthogonally and is referred to as a _ normal symmetry line_.    the description of the qualitative properties of the surface in the paragraph above is sufficient to determine a two - parameter family of weierstrass data ( 1.7 ) that must contain the weierstrass data for any surface with these properties  if it exists .",
    "one parameter controls the conformal type of the quotient , in this case a rhombic torus .",
    "the other can be considered as controlling the placement of the punctures corresponding to the ends .",
    "this is worked out in section 1 and presented in theorem  1 .",
    "the proof of existence of the singly periodic genus - one helicoid consists of showing that the period problem ( ( 1.8),(1.9 ) ) is solvable .",
    "this is done in theorem 2 of section 2 . in theorem 3 of section 3 , we prove that the surface is embedded by decomposing a fundamental domain into disjoint graphs . as usual , the existence and embeddedness proofs are independent .",
    "we do not use any special properties of the parameters that kill the periods .",
    "in fact we show that _ any singly periodic ( by translations ) minimal surface that , in the quotient , is asymptotic to the helicoid ( 1.1 ) and contains a vertical axis and two horizontal parallel lines must be embedded_.    other than the helicoid itself , this example was the first embedded minimal surface ever found that is asymptotic to the helicoid .",
    "it was one of the important steps in the discovery and construction of the non - periodic genus - one helicoid , whose existence is proved in @xcite .",
    "we hope that a complete understanding of this periodic surface will be helpful in giving a non - computational proof , which is not complete of this writing , of the embeddedness of the genus - one helicoid .",
    "we might have discovered this periodic surface earlier , had we been looking for it at the time . in 1989",
    ", the first two authors realized that a construction of fischer and koch @xcite could be modified to produce singly periodic , embedded minimal surfaces with multiple helicoidal ends .",
    "the fischer - koch triply periodic surface is formed of pieces congruent to the solution to the disk - type plateau problem for the boundary in figure 2 .",
    "= 1.4 in = 2.8 in    = 2.8 in    the surface extends , by @xmath0 rotation about its boundary line segments , to a triply periodic embedded surface .",
    "our modification consisted of two simple steps .",
    "first , we realized that the length of the sides marked @xmath1 could be increased without limit , producing an embedded minimal graph over a strip .",
    "this extends to an embedded , singly periodic surface with six flat ends of scherk - type .",
    "second , we observed that the fundamental piece could be modified by rotating the horizontal sides @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath3 by a fixed angle , say @xmath4 .",
    "each @xmath4 produces a fundamental embedded piece that extends by @xmath0 rotation to an embedded minimal surface , asymptotic to three coaxial helicoids , and invariant under a vertical screw motion of the form @xmath5    its weierstrass representation is suggestive of the surface to which we now turn our attention .",
    "the helicoid can be described by the data @xmath6 on @xmath7 in the weierstrass representation @xmath8 the integration produces a conformal minimal immersion , but has a period equal to @xmath9 on any closed curve @xmath10 homotopic to @xmath11 .",
    "thus the immersion in ( 1.2 ) with data ( 1.1 ) is multivalued , and its image , the helicoid , is invariant under a vertical translation produced by the period of ( 1.2 ) on the cycle @xmath11 .",
    "the minimal surface we wish to construct is singly periodic , has a helicoidal - type end and , modulo translations , will have genus equal to one . from general results @xcite and our assumptions about the geometry and topology of the surface in the introduction , we know",
    "that ( if it exists ) it will have a weierstrass representation on a twice - punctured torus and that @xmath12 and @xmath13 will extend meromorphically to the compact torus .",
    "our goal is to determine the weierstrass representation from this information and from the symmetry we assume the surface to have .",
    "we assume that , like the helicoid , our surface contains a single vertical line and  again like the helicoid  the symmetry of @xmath0 rotation about this line fixes this line and no other points .",
    "this implies that the torus is a rhombic torus , which we denote by @xmath14 .",
    "we assume in addition that the surface contains , modulo translations , two parallel _ horizontal _ lines , each meeting the vertical line in a single point .",
    "rotation of @xmath0 about either of these lines fixes both lines in the quotient . because these lines diverge",
    ", such a rotation leaves the punctures corresponding to the ends unmoved .",
    "each line diverges to _ both _ ends , forcing the fixed - point set on the torus of this @xmath0 rotation to be a single closed symmetry curve that must contain both end - punctures .",
    "this curve must cross the curve corresponding to the vertical axis in two points .",
    "the two punctures separate the symmetry line into two components corresponding to the two horizontal lines",
    ". these two points must be symmetrically placed with respect to @xmath0 rotation about the vertical line .",
    "we choose a fundamental domain for our torus so that the lines on the surface correspond to the diagonals of a rhombus . because we will use our development of elliptic functions in @xcite , these diagonals are placed to make a @xmath15 angle with the real axis in @xmath16 .",
    "see figure  4 .",
    "we think of them as the _ horizontal _ and the _ vertical _ diagonal , according to the lines on the surface in space , which are their images .",
    "to avoid possible confusion with lines in the @xmath17 and in @xmath18 , we will refer to them as the v - diagonal and the h - diagonal . without loss of generality",
    ", we may assume that the h - diagonal is the one making a @xmath19 angle with the real axis .",
    "wherever possible , we will deal only with elliptic functions , avoiding any notational reference to the complex variable in @xmath17 , which is not well defined on the torus .",
    "however we will have need of @xmath20the differential of a complex variable @xmath21which projects to the torus and is free of poles and zeros .",
    "rotation by @xmath0 about a point on the surface where the straight lines meet is a rotation about the line determined by the normal to the surface at that point , we refer to it as a",
    "_ normal symmetry_. on the quotient torus it is an orientation - preserving involution : @xmath0 rotation about the center of the torus .",
    "we denote this rotation by @xmath22 .",
    "it fixes four points that are on a half period lattice .",
    "we may choose as a fundamental domain for the torus a rhombus whose center is at one of these points and whose vertex is another such point .",
    "these two points are the intersection of the diagonals of the rhombus .",
    "the other two fixed points of the normal symmetry both lie at the same height as one or the other of the fixed points that lie on the vertical axis .",
    "_ we assume , without loss of generality , that they lie at the same height as the fixed point corresponding to the center of the rhombus . _",
    "= 3.0 in      euler s formula implies that @xmath23 is the sphere .",
    "the quotient map @xmath24 is meromorphic , has degree two , and is branched at the half - period points .",
    "we want to use this map to describe the torus analytically and for that it is necessary to turn this map into a function by identifying three points of the sphere @xmath23 with points in the complex plane .",
    "the motivation for our choice is to make the symmetries of the torus induce simple symmetries of @xmath25 .",
    "this is explained in detail in @xcite .",

    "this determines a degree - two elliptic function , which we denote by @xmath31 .",
