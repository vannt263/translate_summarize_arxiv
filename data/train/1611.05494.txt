    "if one is interested in a large number of different realisations of the output @xmath31 ( e.g. to compute moments of the form @xmath32 $ ] ) , then one needs to solve the sde in ( [ linsysafterdisintr2 ] ) a large number of times . for a state space of high dimension",

    "the last two plots in figures [ fig : btr6 ] and [ fig : btr24 ] show the logarithmic errors for position and velocity for one particular trajectory , which is the same as the one for the sample we considered in section [ sec : wave ] .     and velocity @xmath480 with @xmath481 . ]",

    "we observe that the error in the position is smaller than the error in the velocity , and , the error is smaller if a larger dimension of the reduced order model is used .",

    "moreover , both error bounds are rather tight and close to the actual error of the rom , e.g. the bounds , which are worst case bounds also provide a good prediction of the true time domain error . we also note that bt performs better than spa , both in actually computed mean errors as well as in terms of the error bounds .",
    "we have presented theory for balancing related model order reduction ( mor ) applied to linear stochastic differential equations ( sdes ) with additive lvy noise .",
    "in particular we extended the concepts of reachability and observability to stochastic systems and formulated a new reachability gramian .",
    "we then showed how balancing related mor which is well known for deterministic systems can be extended to sdes with additive lvy noise , e.g. leads to the solution of a lyapunov equation ( with a slightly different right hand side ) .",
    "we proved a general error bound for reduced ( asymptotically stable ) systems in this setting and then gave specific bounds for balanced truncation ( bt ) and singular perturbation approximation ( spa ) which depended on the neglected ( small ) hankel singular values of the linear system .",
