    "since the launch of the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ in 2008 , the on - board large area telescope ( lat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has increased the number of known gamma - ray pulsars from around 10 to over 200 .",
    "indeed , thanks to the lat , we now know pulsars to be the dominant individual gamma - ray source class within the milky way galaxy ( second fermi large area telescope catalog of gamma - ray pulsars , hereafter 2pc , * ? ? ?",
    "two - thirds of gamma - ray pulsars were first detected by observations in other wavelength regimes ( e.g. radio or x - ray pulsars ) , the rotation ephemerides from which could then be used to `` phase fold '' the lat photon arrival times to test for pulsed gamma - ray emission .",
    "however , approximately one third of the lat - detected pulsars were unknown prior to the discovery of pulsations in their gamma - ray flux @xcite .",
    "only a handful of these pulsars were subsequently detected in radio observations , the others could not have been discovered without `` blind '' searches in gamma - ray data .    the recent _",
    "fermi_-lat third source catalog ( 3fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) includes 3033 gamma - ray sources , of which about @xmath8 lack strong associations or likely counterparts from observations at other wavelengths .",
    "many of these sources have similar properties to the known gamma - ray pulsars ( i.e. low time variability and a highly curved spectrum ) .",
    "a large effort is underway to identify pulsars amongst the unidentified pulsar - like gamma - ray sources , both by performing dedicated radio searches targeting the locations of lat sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and by searching amongst the lat data itself for pulsations .",
    "this paper , and an accompanying paper ( j.  wu et al .",
    ", 2017 , in preparation , hereafter paper ii ) , will describe the latest results from the latter technique .    due to the sparsity of the lat photon data ( only about @xmath9 photons per day",
    "are detected from a typical gamma - ray pulsar ) , blindly searching for pulsations amongst the lat photon arrival times is an enormously expensive computational task .",
    "for weak pulsar signals , long integration times are required to reach a detectable , and , as a result , signal parameters must be searched with an extremely fine resolution to avoid losing the signal .",
    "in addition , ensuring sensitivity to the more extreme gamma - ray pulsars , such as young pulsars with high spin - down rates or faster spinning , requires searching over vast parameter volumes , and therefore incurs a proportionally large computation cost . to meet these requirements",
    ", we utilize the computing power of the project , which distributes the computations amongst the many thousands of participating volunteers devices @xcite .",
    "we began performing blind searches for gamma - ray pulsars on in 2011 , with the first such survey resulting in the detection of four new pulsars @xcite .",
    "in a recent study @xcite , we investigated the efficiency of different blind search schemes ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) , and developed new techniques to boost the sensitivity of a search without impacting its computational cost .",
    "these new methods are currently being used as part of a large - scale survey of pulsar - like _",
    "fermi_-lat sources , running on . in combination with the recent",
    "`` pass 8 '' improvements to the lat event reconstruction @xcite , these advances have had a spectacular effect on the blind search sensitivity , an early indication of which was given by the detection of psr  j1906@xmath100722 within one of the first sources searched in this survey @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present @xmath11 new pulsar discoveries from the full survey of @xmath12 sources .",
    "these are the result of around @xmath0  years of cpu time generously donated by volunteers .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [",
    "s : scheme ] the search methods are described ; an investigation of the sensitivity of the search follows in section [ s : sensitivity ] ; details of the newly discovered pulsars and their timing solutions are given in section [ s : timing ] ; section [ s : discussion ] contains a discussion of the sensitivity of blind searches to unidentified gamma - ray pulsars ; and finally we summarize our conclusions in section [ s : concl ] .    in paper ii",
    ", we will describe in more detail the lat data preparation procedures ; the selection of target sources and ranking based on their spectral properties ; the identification of candidate multiwavelength counterparts ; phase - resolved gamma - ray spectral analyses of the newly discovered pulsars ; and the results of dedicated follow - up radio pulsation searches .",
    "the data searched during the survey consisted of gamma - ray photons detected by the lat between 2008  august  4 and 2014  april  6 ( 2014  october  1 for some sources searched later in the survey ) with energies above @xmath13  mev .",
    "photons were included if they arrived within @xmath14 of a target source , with a zenith angle @xmath15 and when the lat s rocking angle was @xmath16 .",
    "the photons were selected and analyzed using the ` p8_source_v3 ` instrument response functions ( irfs ) .    for each target source , we performed a likelihood spectral analysis using the ` pointlike ` package @xcite .",
    "our source model included all 3fgl catalog sources within @xmath17 of the target source and used the ` template_4years_p8_v2_scaled.fits ` map cube and ` isotropic_source_4years_p8v3 ` template to model the galactic diffuse emission @xcite and isotropic background respectively .",
    "target sources were modeled with an exponentially cutoff power law typical of gamma - ray pulsars . during the likelihood fitting , we allowed the normalization of the diffuse models , and the spectral parameters of the target source and all 3fgl sources within @xmath18 to vary .",
    "sources searched near the beginning of the survey had their sky positions fixed at the 3fgl location .",
    "later sources were relocalized during the likelihood fitting to exploit the improved angular resolution offered by the pass 8 data .",
    "spectral energy distribution ( sed ) plots and test statistic ( ts ) maps were visually compared to the corresponding 3fgl sources to diagnose any problems with the fitting . with the best - fitting source model , we used ` gtsrcprob ` to compute weights representing the probability of each photon having come from our target source based on their reconstructed energy and arrival direction .",
    "full details of the data preparation methods , and a description of how target sources were prioritized for searching , will be given in paper  ii .",
    "the irfs and diffuse templates used here were internal pre - release versions of the pass 8 analysis tools because the final release versions were not yet available when the survey began .",
    "when investigating the gamma - ray emission from the region surrounding psr  j1906@xmath100722 @xcite , we found that these preliminary irfs and templates resulted in spectral parameters consistent with those found using the final pass 8 release .",
    "however , photon weights calculated with the most recent pass 8 data usually result in slightly higher pulsation significance within the same time interval ; the sensitivity estimates in section [ s : sensitivity ] are likely to be more conservative as a result .      to search for gamma - ray pulsations in lat data ,",
    "it is necessary to assume a certain `` phase model '' ( i.e. a rotation ephemeris ) relating the arrival time of every photon to a certain rotational phase , and test all possible combinations of the model parameters for pulsations , indicated by large values of a detection statistic ( described in section [ s : det_stats ] ) . in the case where a signal is present , the distribution of rotational phases will deviate significantly from uniformity . for isolated pulsars ,",
    "the phase model is typically described by a taylor series expansion in time around a chosen reference epoch @xmath19 , for photon arrival time @xmath20 at the , @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the @xmath23th time derivative of the pulsar s rotational frequency , @xmath24 . while the higher derivative terms are often measurable for young pulsars , it is usually sufficient ( and often only feasible ) to include only the first two terms in the blind search , resulting in a simplified phase model in which the spin frequency decreases by a constant spin - down rate , @xmath25 .",
    "aside from correcting for this constant spin - down , it is also necessary to account for the apparent doppler modulation of pulsations that results from the earth s orbit around the .",
    "this can be achieved by applying position - dependent corrections to the measured photon arrival times , to retrieve the set of arrival times at the , hereafter denoted as @xmath26 .",
    "the angular resolution at which sky positions must be searched increases linearly with the pulsar s spin frequency ( see equation [ e : sky_spacing ] ) . for all but the slowest of pulsars ,",
    "the required resolution is finer than the gamma - ray source localization , determined by the lat s point - spread function . for a blind survey of unidentified gamma - ray point sources ,",
    "it is therefore necessary to search in two sky positional parameters ( r.a . @xmath27 and decl .",
    "@xmath28 ) , making the overall search parameter space four - dimensional . for sources for which we used the original 3fgl locations , we searched a circular region around the source with an angular radius that was 50% larger than the semi - major axis of the 95% confidence region . for relocalized sources , we searched a conservatively large region with a radius three times larger than the semi - major axis of the @xmath29 confidence region .",
    "some pulsars ( e.g. psrs  j2017@xmath103625 and j1350@xmath306225 ) were found near the edge , or even slightly outside of their search regions , indicating that the confidence regions may be underestimated , and pulsars may have been missed by our survey as a result .",
    "this could be due to nearby , unmodeled gamma - ray sources `` pulling '' the apparent position of the source away from its true position , as was seen with psr  j1906@xmath100722 @xcite . to mitigate this effect in future surveys",
    "it may be necessary to search over larger regions , especially for sources at low galactic latitude , where source confusion is more likely .",
    "however , increasing the solid angle over which we search increases the computational cost of the search by the same factor .",
    "we split the search parameter space into two main regions : the young pulsar region , with spin frequencies below @xmath31  hz ; and the region at higher spin frequencies .",
    "this parameter space is shown by the shaded area in figure [ f : f_fdot_diagram ] , and covers all currently known young pulsars , s and magnetars . in the low - frequency region",
    "we extend the @xmath32 range from @xmath33 down to @xmath34  hz  s@xmath5 to be sensitive to the youngest and most energetic pulsars .",
    "older , recycled s have much lower spin - down rates , and we therefore only search from @xmath33 down to @xmath35  hz  s@xmath5 in this region . since more sky locations must be searched at higher frequencies , the majority of the computational cost of the search is spent in the high - frequency and high - spin - down regions .",
    "pulsars whose pulse profile features two similarly sized peaks separated by half a rotation have most power in the second harmonic of their spin frequency .",
    "for this reason , we search up to @xmath36  hz , more than twice the frequency of the fastest known , @xmath37  hz @xcite .",
    "only one known pulsar , psr  j0537@xmath306910 , has its second spin harmonic outside our parameter space @xcite .        for each of the 118 unidentified lat sources in which we searched ,",
    "this parameter space is split into @xmath38@xmath39 smaller _ work units _",
    ", each of which can be searched in a few hours on a typical home computer .",
    "these work units are then distributed amongst volunteers computers .      in all stages of a gamma - ray pulsar search ,",
    "statistical tests are used to measure the strength of pulsations for given rotational parameters .",
    "the detection statistics used in this survey are described in detail in @xcite , and briefly defined here .",
    "@xcite demonstrated the advantages of applying a weight to each photon indicating its probability of having come from the target source .",
    "the photon probability weights mentioned in section [ s : data ] , denoted by @xmath40 , were therefore used to weight the contributions of each photon to a detection statistic .",
    "weighting photons improves the sensitivity of a blind search by avoiding the need to apply specific photon energy and angular offset cuts , and by increasing the apparent fraction of flux that is pulsed .    to mitigate the computational cost of a blind search ,",
    "semicoherent methods can be used , in which only photons arriving within a certain time difference from one another are combined coherently . the ( real - valued ) semicoherent detection statistic used in this search",
    "is defined as here denotes that the detection statistic only sums power in the fundamental harmonic . ]",
    "@xmath41 } \\ ,    \\hat{w}_t^{\\rm\\tiny{rect}}(\\tau_{jk})\\ , ,    \\label{e : s1_definition}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the time difference , or lag , between the arrivals of the @xmath43th and @xmath44th photons , and @xmath45 is a rectangular window , of length @xmath46 , @xmath47 the @xmath48 term of equation ( [ e : s1_definition ] ) is a normalizing factor , @xmath49 making the noise distribution of @xmath50 well approximated by a normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance .",
    "the lag window length , @xmath46 , is an important tuneable parameter for a search based on semicoherent methods .",
    "a longer lag window offers more sensitivity , but requires a finer grid in all four search parameters , and therefore results in a more costly search .    in the case where the lag window covers the entire observation span ,",
    "then all photons are combined fully coherently , and the test statistic reduces to the well - known rayleigh test ( modulo a constant term , and normalization ) at the fundamental harmonic , @xmath51 , @xmath52 with the normalization constant , @xmath53 this is hereafter referred to as the coherent fourier power at the @xmath54th harmonic .    to gain further sensitivity to weak signals",
    ", one can also combine the coherent fourier power from several harmonics of the fundamental spin frequency .",
    "the well - known @xmath55-test developed by @xcite offers a heuristic method for combining these harmonics in the typical case where the pulsar s pulse profile ( and hence the distribution of fourier power amongst the different harmonics ) is unknown in advance by maximizing over the number of included harmonics , @xmath56 , via @xmath57 combining fourier power from higher harmonics requires finer resolution in all phase model parameters .",
    "it therefore only becomes feasible in later search stages , in which the parameter space within which a candidate signal could lie is constrained to be very narrow .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , a multistage search scheme can be used to combine the efficiency of a semicoherent search with the superior sensitivity of fully coherent methods . in this scheme",
    ", the majority of the search is spent scanning the entire parameter space with the most efficient method available , before `` following - up '' the most interesting candidates in more sensitive stages .      in this survey ,",
    "the first stage used the semicoherent detection statistic , @xmath50 , with a lag window of length @xmath58s @xmath59 days .",
    "this lag window is a factor of two longer than in previous searches @xcite .    as described in @xcite , the semicoherent detection statistic , @xmath50 , defined in equation  ( [ e : s1_definition ] ) , can be approximated more efficiently as a , by utilizing the fftw algorithms @xcite .",
    "we hereby refer to the dft form of the semicoherent detection statistic as @xmath60 .",
    "each fft searched over a frequency bandwidth of @xmath61  hz .",
    "we applied the technique of complex heterodyning , i.e. multiplying the fft input vector by an additional sine wave at the heterodyning frequency , @xmath62 , to shift the search band to higher frequencies , @xmath63  hz , without increasing the fft memory size , @xmath64  mib .",
    "this allows us to search for high - frequency signals , such as those from msps , using typical computing hardware .",
    "furthermore , since the required resolution in the sky position becomes finer at higher frequencies , we can construct individual sky grids for each frequency band to avoid oversampling sky positions at low frequencies .",
    "the first frequency band was centered at @xmath33  hz , and all frequencies below @xmath65  mhz were ignored to prevent harmonics of s orbital frequency ( @xmath66  mhz ) from `` drowning out '' any astrophysical signal .    to ensure approximately equal sensitivity throughout the frequency band",
    ", we performed lag - domain interpolation @xcite , whereby each photon pair is interpolated into the @xmath67 nearest bins on either side in the lag - series using a welch - windowed sinc kernel @xcite . since this technique introduces an additional computational cost per pair of photons , we performed a photon weight cutoff to include at most the @xmath68 highest - weight photons , ensuring that the computation time remained the dominant factor .",
    "identifying the photon weights as the probability of each photon being from a pulsar , the maximum ( coherent ) is proportional to @xmath69 . for sources where fewer than @xmath68 photons were required to reach @xmath70 of this maximum (",
    "typically sources far from the galactic plane , where the diffuse background is lower ) we increased the number of interpolation bins , up to a maximum of @xmath71 .",
    "a signal whose parameters , denoted by the vector @xmath72 , lie within the search space will , in general , not lie exactly at one of our search - grid points , and some of the s / n is lost as a result of this offset , @xmath73 .",
    "we call this ( fractional ) loss in s / n _ mismatch _ , @xmath74 we can predict the expected mismatch as a function of the distance to the nearest search - grid point using an analytical `` metric '' approximation , as described in @xcite .",
    "this prediction can then be used to construct an efficiently spaced grid of points in the parameter space at which to test for pulsations .",
    "the spacing of frequency trials is fixed by the dft formulation of @xmath60 to be @xmath75 while this spacing would result in a large average mismatch , we can improve upon this by performing simple `` interbinning '' @xcite to partially recover the lost s / n experienced by signals lying between our frequency bins . this technique does not recover the full s / n for such signals , but is far more efficient than the alternative of `` zero - padding '' the fft to double length .    in the remaining parameters , we construct a cubic lattice with spacings chosen to provide the optimal maximum mismatch in each parameter of @xmath76 according to the metric approximation . in @xmath32",
    "the spacing depends on the lag window  @xmath46 but also requires a refinement based on the full data set @xcite , @xmath77^{-1/2}\\,.\\ ] ] the grid of sky locations is first defined within a circle ( with unit radius ) in the ecliptic plane as a square grid with spacings in each direction of @xmath78^{-1/2}\\ , ,      \\label{e : sky_spacing}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the maximum frequency in the searched frequency band , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the earth s orbital semi - major axis ( in light seconds ) and orbital angular frequency respectively , and @xmath82 .",
    "these locations are then projected back into the celestial sphere to cover the lat source localization region . at each location , barycentering corrections are applied to each photon s arrival time according to the jpl de405 solar system ephemeris .",
    "each work unit performs an fft at every location in this cubic lattice within its assigned portion of the parameter space .",
    "the five highest values of @xmath60 ( including interbinned samples ) are stored in a running short list that is updated after each . at the end of the semicoherent stage , this short list is saved , and each short - listed candidate is automatically `` followed up '' in additional , more sensitive search stages .",
    "after the semicoherent stage , we are left with a small number of candidates in each work unit that have been localized to a small region of the parameter space . however , due to the large number of work units for each -lat source , weak signals in these short lists can be of low overall significance . to separate weak signals from noise candidates , we can carry out more sensitive follow - up stages to act as a veto for the large number of candidate signals reported back by the semicoherent stage .    in the survey",
    ", we implemented an intermediate refinement stage , in which candidates from the first stage are refined using a double - length lag window ( @xmath83 s @xmath84 days ) .",
    "this step is computationally cheap , and narrows down the volume in which the candidate signal lies by a factor of @xmath85 .",
    "following the semicoherent refinement stage , we now have a parameter space volume around each candidate that is small enough for a fully coherent search to be feasible with just a small associated computing cost . for this stage ,",
    "we search only in the fundamental harmonic using the @xmath86 test , with grid spacings according to the coherent metric approximation derived in @xcite .",
    "all search stages up to this point are carried out on the volunteers computers , after which the short - listed candidates from the initial semicoherent stage ( each of which were followed up ) , and the top candidates from the coherent follow - up stage are sent back to our servers .",
    "as results are sent back , we update the top 20 most significant coherent candidates ( see appendix [ a : pfa_ranking ] for a description of the ranking procedure ) overall from each source , and perform further follow - up and refinement procedures on them .",
    "first , we refine the location of the candidate using the @xmath86 statistic , but calculated over a grid with a smaller mismatch ( @xmath87 ) than that used in the third stage .",
    "we then perform a fully coherent search using the @xmath55-test to incoherently sum the fourier power in the first five harmonics .    after this refinement step , diagnostic plots for each candidate are produced that illustrate the candidates signals and their evolution throughout the -lat observation time .",
    "this allows us to identify pulsars with timing noise , whose pulsations may be visible in these plots despite having a low apparent coherent power due to variations in their signal phase .",
    "in @xcite , the sensitivity of a blind search for gamma - ray pulsations was defined as the minimum pulsed fraction of the observed photon flux that can be detected with a fixed probability , @xmath88 , and with a fixed false - alarm probability , @xmath89 .",
    "we now apply this definition to investigate the sensitivity of our search to each source in the survey .",
    "the quantity of interest is the fraction of the background - subtracted weighted photon flux that is pulsed , denoted @xmath90 .",
    "given a set of photon weights , the fractions of the weighted photon counts that can be attributed to the source , @xmath91 , and background fraction @xmath92 , are estimated as @xcite @xmath93 the probability of the @xmath43th photon being pulsed is @xmath94 , and the overall weighted pulse profile takes the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the background - subtracted pulse profile , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the pulse profile after subtracting all unpulsed emission ( background or otherwise ) .",
    "these quantities are illustrated in figure [ f : pulse_profile_example ] .",
    "note that this definition of the pulsed fraction is equal to the area under the pulse in the normalized pulse profile , as opposed to the `` rms pulsed flux '' used by e.g. @xcite , which is additionally dependent on the shape of the pulse profile .",
    "while the rms pulsed flux provides a measure of the power of pulsations , this does not provide a physically meaningful measure of the proportion of pulsed flux emitted by the pulsar @xcite .",
    "3625 illustrating the definition of the pulsed fraction .",
    "the blue dashed line indicates the background level , @xmath92 .",
    "the pulsed fraction is defined by the area under the template pulse profile above its lowest level ( the orange shaded area ) , divided by the source fraction , @xmath91 ( that is the sum of blue and orange areas ) . ]    for a pulsar to be detected by this survey , its signal must be strong enough to enter the short list of semicoherent candidates within the work unit that covers the region of the parameter space in which the signal lies . that is , the measured value of @xmath60 at the grid point nearest the signal s location in the parameter space must be greater than the lowest value in the short list of candidates , @xmath99 .",
    "the probability that a signal with a pulse profile described by the complex fourier coefficients @xmath100 will be detected by the survey , as a function of the pulsed fraction is @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the ( empirically measured ) probability that @xmath99 is less than @xmath60 , and @xmath103 is the probability density function of the measured value of @xmath60 for a signal at a random location within the searched parameter space ( see appendix [ a : app_signal_stats ] for the derivation of this distribution ) .",
    "each of these quantities depends additionally on the set of photon weights for each source ; we have omitted these dependencies from equation ( [ e : pdet ] ) for readability .",
    "this definition of the detection probability is illustrated in figure [ f : detection_probability ] .",
    "this equation can be solved numerically to recover the minimum pulsed fraction , @xmath104 , that can be detected at a given probability .",
    "will be followed - up ( and hence detected ) .",
    "the detection probability is therefore the area under the product of these functions , shown by the grey shaded area . ]",
    "the purpose of the coherent follow - up stage of the survey is to greatly improve the significance of any true signal that is detected by the first stage , and we apply our final false - alarm probability threshold to the candidates from this stage . for typical values of @xmath90 given by solving equation ( [ e : pdet ] ) , the expected coherent power corresponds to an extremely significant signal ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 ) and hence even a conservative false - alarm threshold has no real effect on the overall sensitivity estimate . in practice ,",
    "effects such as glitches or timing noise that are not included in our simplified isolated pulsar phase model can severely reduce the observed coherent power , resulting in true signals with large @xmath90 appearing with low significance .",
    "we attempt to mitigate these effects somewhat by monitoring the 20 most significant candidates from both the semicoherent stage and the follow - up stages rather than applying the false - alarm threshold rigorously .    in table",
    "[ t : minimum_pulsed_fraction ] we estimate the minimum pulsed fraction , @xmath107 , that can be detected with @xmath108 for each source in our survey , averaged over the pulse profiles from the 30 most significant pulsars in the 2pc , and assuming constant signal parameters ( i.e. no glitches or significant timing noise ) . for sources in which a new gamma - ray pulsar was discovered , we also report the measured pulsed fraction for illustration . note that while some sources have @xmath109 , this does not necessarily preclude the detection of pulsed emission from this source , since the assumptions on which these estimates are based might not always apply .",
    "for example , the true pulse profile could be narrower than average or the photon weights might not accurately represent the probability of each photon coming from the target source .",
    "the results of this sensitivity estimation displayed in figure [ f : ps_nffts ] therefore also illustrate the range of thresholds covered by the various pulse profiles observed .    while the semicoherent search stage is rather robust to the presence of timing noise , any large enough deviation from our simplified constant spin - down model",
    "will significantly affect the sensitivity of our search . glitching pulsars , for example , are particularly difficult to detect because their large jumps in spin frequency prevent the s / n from accumulating steadily throughout the observations .",
    "pulsars in binary systems are all but impossible to find in a search for isolated pulsars .",
    "our pulsed fraction thresholds therefore only represent our sensitivity to well - behaved isolated pulsars . in particular , our sensitivity estimates are likely to be most reliable for sources far from the galactic plane , where we would expect to find old , stable msps .",
    "our sensitivity estimates rely on the assumption that a pulsar lies within the sky region in which we search .",
    "as mentioned in section [ s : param_space ] , in some cases , the extension of this region may have been underestimated .",

    "[ f : pulsar_significances ] , we have plotted the point - source significance versus the @xmath55-test value for each pulsar in the 2pc , as well as the blind search pulsars detected after this catalog was produced @xcite , and those discovered by this survey ( including psr  j1906@xmath100722 , * ? ? ?",
    "we can see that the @xmath55-test value for a pulsar can be well approximated by its point - source test statistic ( ts ) value ( as shown by the dashed line in figure [ f : pulsar_significances ] ) .",

    "we begin by looking at how the coherent detection statistic , @xmath86 , varies with the observation duration , @xmath566 .",
    "since the @xmath55-test is a maximized sum over @xmath567 values , the relevant scalings with respect to the observation time will be unchanged . as shown in @xcite , the expected values of @xmath86 for a signal with average photon arrival rate , @xmath564 , pulse profile fourier coefficients , @xmath100 , and pulsed fraction @xmath568 over an observation lasting @xmath566 is approximately @xmath569 \\approx 2 p_{\\rm s}^2 \\,\\mu \\ ,",

    "this is relevant for detecting gamma - ray pulsations using known radio or x - ray ephemerides ; since only a small number of trials are required , fully coherent searches are perfectly feasible and signals only need to overcome a low threshold to be detected . as @xmath566 increases ,",
    "so too does the point - source significance , and pulsars whose gamma - ray pulsations are not initially above the detection threshold will eventually be detectable .",
    "indeed , pulsations have been detected in this way from sources all the way down to the point - source detection threshold @xcite .    however , the limiting factor in our blind searches is the sensitivity of the initial semicoherent stage .",
    "the expected semicoherent ( power ) , given a lag - window length , @xmath46 , is @xmath570 \\approx p_{\\rm s}^2 \\,\\mu \\ , \\left|\\gamma_1\\right|^2 \\",

    ", we can identify the effective coherent threshold , @xmath572 , in terms of the semicoherent s / n threshold , @xmath573 , as @xmath574 this reveals an unintuitive result : with a fixed semicoherent threshold and lag - window size , as the observation time increases our sensitivity threshold in terms of the coherent signal power ( and hence point - source significance ) actually _ increases_.    equation ( [ e : p1_thresh ] ) also reveals the solution to this problem : if we are to maintain the same source significance threshold in searches using longer observation times , we must also increase the lag - window duration by the same factor .",
    "however , as was derived in @xcite , the computational cost associated with a blind semicoherent search scales with @xmath575 .    in figure [",
    "f : sens_compcost ] , we have estimated the semicoherent s / n at the time of discovery for all gamma - ray pulsars detected in previous blind searches by calculating their @xmath86 values from the data provided by the 2pc , and scaling these down to the @xmath566 used in each search .",
    "we have also estimated the computational cost that would be required to perform each search ( only covering the young pulsar parameter space ) using the original lag - window size ( @xmath576  s ) and observation length , but with otherwise the same search scheme described in section [ s : scheme ] .",
    "searches prior to @xcite only searched for pulsations from the lat point - source location , rather than searching over many possible sky locations .",
    "while this significantly decreases the required computational cost , this requires pulsars either to be close to the lat source s estimated position , or to have a strong pulsed signal , such that they can be detected despite a large positional offset .",
    "this also rules out the detection of isolated msps , whose high frequency requires us to search sky locations with much finer resolution .",
    "we therefore exclude the cost of searching for msps from our estimated computing costs .        in this figure",
    ", we have also estimated the computational cost and s / n that each of the new pulsars would have had if we had performed these searches with the lag - window duration used by previous searches .",
    "at least four , possibly as many as seven pulsars would have been below the lowest semicoherent s / n from a previously detected pulsar , and therefore most likely would not have been detected had we not performed the more expensive search with the longer lag window .",
    "figure [ f : sens_compcost ] also shows how the computing cost and s / n increased for these pulsars as a result of using a lag - window with double the length .",
    "we see that only one pulsar detected here required less computing time than any previously detected gamma - ray pulsar , with the most expensive detection being more than @xmath13 times more costly .",
    "based on this argument , the current survey should have taken many years to complete , even taking into account a generous estimate of a doubling of the computing power between the two surveys computed on .",
    "in actuality , the first 118 sources were searched in just over one year , similar in duration to the first gamma - ray pulsar survey .",
    "we consider this a testament to the improved efficiency of the search methods developed in @xcite .",
    "the signal detected here with the lowest coherent power was from psr  j1105@xmath306037 with @xmath577 . from the spread about the diagonal of figure [ f : pulsar_significances ]",
    ", we estimate that a pulsar with a particularly narrow pulse profile should be detectable with a ts of around @xmath13 ( a significance of approximately @xmath578 ) .",
    "the lowest - significance point source in which a pulsar was detected here ( psr j1350@xmath306225 ) had a ts of @xmath579 ( approximate significance @xmath580 ) .",
    "this could be because the ranking method for our target sources depends on the sources significance ; brighter -lat sources were searched earlier than dimmer sources with similar spectral properties .",
    "it is therefore possible that as our survey continues we may yet detect a pulsar with a lower point - source significance .    in any case",
    ", the following trend is clear : as the _ fermi _ mission continues , dimmer pulsars will gradually become detectable to blind searches , but the computing cost required to detect equally low @xmath55-test signals will rise quickly as we search longer data sets .",
    "this survey received a large boost to its sensitivity in the form of the `` free '' ( in terms of computational cost ) increase in the observed photon counts offered by the pass 8 data reprocessing @xcite .",
    "it is unlikely that such a welcome jump in sensitivity will occur again in the near future , and therefore it may become necessary to make some sacrifices to maintain the current search sensitivity without the computing cost requirements becoming unrealistic .",
    "for example , reducing the spin - down range to which we are sensitive by a factor of @xmath581 will reduce the computational cost by the same factor , while only losing sensitivity to the most energetic of pulsars .",
    "indeed , one could argue that we already have greatly reduced sensitivity to these pulsars since they typically exhibit the most timing noise and large glitches",
    ".    another option would be to focus our available computing resources to perform more sensitive searches of only the most promising target sources , rather than performing wide - ranging surveys of many unidentified sources as was done here .",
    "indeed , if we look at how the computing cost was distributed amongst sources , as shown in figure [ f : ps_nffts ] , we can see that , even with a favorable pulse profile , some sources would require a pulsed fraction far higher than unity for us to detect pulsations .",
    "the procedures described in section [ s : sensitivity ] allow us to reliably predict our search sensitivity to new sources for the first time .",
    "now that we are able to predict this in advance , we can remove such sources from our search list and focus our efforts on improving our sensitivity to the more promising sources .",
    "if we relax the requirement of 95% detection probability used in producing figure [ f : ps_nffts ] slightly to reflect a more moderate chance of detecting pulsations from each source , we find that @xmath582 of the computing cost of this survey could perhaps have been better spent by removing unpromising sources .      only energetic pulsars with spin - down powers above @xmath583ergs@xmath5 are observed to emit gamma - ray pulsations @xcite .",
    "the group of non - recycled gamma - ray pulsars therefore lies at the young and energetic end of the overall pulsar population , with typical characteristic ages less than a few million years , and surface magnetic field strengths between @xmath584@xmath585 g .",
    "this contrasts with the population of non - recycled radio pulsars ( which extends to characteristic ages of up to 1 gyr , and spin - down powers as low as @xmath586ergs@xmath5 , @xcite ) and with magnetars ( whose surface magnetic fields are in excess of @xmath587 g , @xcite ) . in these respects ,",
    "the group of pulsars detected here appears to be consistent with the overall population of young gamma - ray pulsars ( see figure [ f : f_fdot_diagram ] , and table [ t : params2 ] ) .",
    "two of the new pulsars reported here ( psr  j1057@xmath305851 and psr  j1827@xmath301446 ) are the most slowly spinning gamma - ray pulsars yet discovered , at @xmath588  hz and @xmath589  hz respectively . while the existence of these pulsars is not in tension with estimates of the gamma - ray pulsar `` death line '' @xcite , their discovery does extend the known population of gamma - ray pulsars down to lower spin frequencies .",
    "sensitive blind searches that can detect faint young pulsars are important to fully explore the low-@xmath387 region of the gamma - ray pulsar population , and to reduce biases inherent in it @xcite .    also of interest",
    "are the pulsars detected here despite exhibiting significant timing noise , psr j1844@xmath300346 , and psr  j0359@xmath105414 .",
    "the large contributions of higher frequency derivatives mean that the original phase model used in the blind search could not maintain phase coherence over the full duration of the data .",
    "these effects make it very difficult for the coherent follow - up stages to pick up these signals . on the other hand ,",
    "the semicoherent stage is largely unaffected by timing noise , although large glitches are also detrimental to the semicoherent sensitivity .",
    "noisy pulsars will therefore only appear as semicoherent candidates , and may easily escape detection from our pipeline , which focuses on the results from the final coherent follow - up .",
    "further investigation of the vast number of semicoherent candidates reported by may yet reveal more noisy pulsars lurking in our results .",
    "we have presented the discovery of 13 new gamma - ray pulsars found by the ongoing survey of unidentified _ fermi_-lat sources . amongst these pulsars are two new energetic pulsars with @xmath590 erg s@xmath5 , one of which experienced a large glitch ; and the two slowest spinning gamma - ray pulsars yet detected .    as the _ fermi _ mission continues and the lat gathers more data , the sensitivity to weak pulsar signals will increase , and many currently undetectable pulsars could rise above the detection threshold in the near future , although future searches with more data will also require even more computing power to be sensitive to similarly weak signals .",
    "we also placed realistic upper limits on the pulsed flux from point sources from which no pulsations were detected .",
    "the framework for this allows us to also predict our sensitivity to other sources , enabling us to identify promising targets for searching , and also to veto sources from which pulsations would be almost impossible to detect .",
    "this will allow us to focus our computing power on increasing our sensitivity to the most promising sources in future surveys .",
    "a further exciting new advancement is the recent launch of the first survey for gamma - ray pulsars in candidate binary systems with well - constrained orbital parameters , similar to the search that discovered psr  j1311@xmath303430 @xcite .",

    "in the final follow - up stages , performed offline , we would like to only search the most significant candidates . to rank candidates by their significance",
    ", we need to account for the effective number of trials from which each candidate has resulted . while the number of ( semicoherent ) independent trials is approximately the same in each work unit within each source , there are more work units in higher frequency bands due to the density of sky locations increasing with frequency . additionally , since the grid of sky locations searched in the first stage is constructed at the highest frequency in the band , whereas the `` zoomed in '' grids are defined by the candidates spin frequencies , the number of trials in the refinement step varies from candidate to candidate .",
    "the overall result of these effects is that candidates with high detection statistic values are more likely to occur by chance in higher frequency bands than in lower frequency bands , and at the higher end of the frequency band .",
    "we construct a consistent ranking statistic by comparing candidates false alarm probabilities whilst taking the differing number of trials into account .",
    "we start from the result @xcite that the , @xmath591 , of the maximum value of @xmath592 samples of the random variable @xmath593 , is related to @xmath594 , the of @xmath593 , by @xmath595^n\\,.\\ ] ] the false alarm probability of @xmath596 after @xmath592 samples is therefore @xmath597^n\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx n p_{{\\rm fa},1}(x_{\\rm max})\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have assumed that @xmath598 . in our case ,",
    "the single - trial false alarm for a candidate with coherent power @xmath86 is @xmath599 where @xmath600 is the central chi - squared distribution with two degrees of freedom .",
    "it is considerably more difficult to estimate the effective number of independent trials , since each candidate is the result of a large number of trials in previous search stages using different detection statistics .",
    "however , since at this stage we are only interested in ranking candidates within each source , and the number of independent trials in the semicoherent step is approximately the same for each candidate , we only need to consider the varying number of trials in the follow - up stages , and the total number of work units in each frequency band .",
    "the overall false - alarm probability is therefore a function of the frequency of the candidate , @xmath24 , and the coherent power : @xmath601 where the constant of proportionality , @xmath602 , is the ( unknown ) number of independent trials per work unit , @xmath603 is the number of work units within the appropriate frequency band and @xmath604 is the number of trials in the coherent follow - up stage for a candidate at frequency @xmath24 .",
    "we define the ranking statistic , @xmath605 for follow - up analyses according to the logarithm of the inverse of the false alarm probability , @xmath606 \\nonumber \\\\ & = \\frac{\\mathcal{p}_1}{2 } -\\log\\left[n_w(f)\\right ] -\\log\\left[n_f(f)\\right]\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have removed the constant term corresponding to @xmath602 .",
    "we note that the above formulation of @xmath605 can _ only _ be used to rank pulsar candidates from the same source , as the effective number of independent trials per work unit ( @xmath602 ) varies from source to source .",
    "to estimate the sensitivity of the search , it is necessary to know the expected distribution of @xmath607 in the presence of a signal for each source . to derive this , we first expand the double sum of equation ( [ e : s1_definition ] ) and separate it into terms in which photon indices are never equal . identifying the photon weights as the probability that each photon originated from the source in question , and therefore assuming that each photon has a probability @xmath608 of having been pulsed , we find the following expressions ,    @xmath609 & = w_j^{m+1 } \\ , p_{\\rm s } \\ , \\gamma_n",

    "this is illustrated in figure [ f : detection_probability ] .",

    "the phase increment was completely free to vary and exhibits a high correlation with the glitch epoch .",

    "once an initial combination of valid glitch parameters has been found ( including a suitable combination of glitch epoch and phase increment that removes any phase discontinuity at the glitch ) we can remove this correlation by separating the total phase increment in our phase model into separate terms : a glitch epoch - dependent term accounting for the known difference in phase between the glitch model parameters being sampled and the initial `` reference '' glitch model , plus a random offset that is allowed to vary as part of the monte  carlo sampling . denoting the reference glitch model with the subscript @xmath618 , and the sampled glitch model parameters by the subscript @xmath619 ,",

    "the other terms ensure that the reference glitch model s desirable property of causing no large phase discontinuity between the pulse before and after the glitch also applies to the sampled glitch parameters .",
    "this ensures that the sampling rate ( and hence the efficiency of the timing procedure ) is not unnecessarily burdened by having to phase - fold the data with glitch models resulting in large phase discontinuities , which will obviously have a low likelihood and be rejected .",
    "removing the correlation between the glitch epoch and the part of the phase increment that is being sampled ensures that the monte  carlo chains explore the parameter space efficiently .",
    "this is especially helpful at the beginning of the monte  carlo run , as the starting locations of the chain are spread uniformly throughout the parameter space , and could otherwise easily get stuck in low - likelihood regions , as they struggle to jump to the very narrow , highly correlated region of high likelihood ."
