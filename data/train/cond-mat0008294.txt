    "_ iterated fully coordinated percolation _ ( referred to as ifc percolation from this point on ) is an extension to the ordinary percolation and the _ fully coordinated percolation _ ( referred to as fc percolation hereon ) models .",
    "these are well - known problems of geometrical phase transition where global connectivity is singular as a function of local connectivity ( see , for a review , stauffer and aharony @xcite ) .",
    "in ordinary site percolation on a square lattice , sites are randomly occupied with an independent occupation probability @xmath0 .",
    "two nearest neighbor sites are considered connected if they are both occupied . a collection of connected sites , i.e.",
    ", every site in the group is connected to every other site either directly or through the paths of nearest neighbors , is termed a cluster . when @xmath0 is increased until it reaches a critical value @xmath1 , an infinitely spanning cluster will form for the first time . the square lattice shown in fig .",

    "first perform ordinary percolation .",
    "after this is done , determine which of the occupied sites have all four of their nearest neighbors also occupied .",
    "occupied sites having this property are called _ fully coordinated sites _ and will remain occupied while the other sites will be removed .",
    "this process of winnowing occupied sites was described in @xcite and we called the resulting model the _ fully coordinated percolation _ model ( fc percolation ) . the square lattice shown in fig .",
    "[ sim_stages](b ) is an example of fully coordinated percolation constructed from the ordinary percolation sites shown in fig .",
    "[ sim_stages](a ) .",
    "the gray - filled circles are fully coordinated sites .",

    "= 1.00    notice that this problem is different from bootstrap percolation ( see , for a review , adler @xcite ) where sites of less connectivity are iteratively removed until no more sites have insufficient connectivities .",
    "this is in contrast to our problem where we only perform the culling of non - fully coordinated sites twice .    in our earlier work @xcite",
    ", we found that the sizes of the fully - connected subregions ( with no internal holes ) in an incipient infinite cluster in fc percolation are much larger than those found in ordinary percolation . in this study",
    ", we find this same increase in the sizes of the fully - connected subregions to continue when the full coordination requirement is iterated one more time .",
    "the regions of high local connectivity are generally interesting because they would seriously affect the vibrational modes in an equivalent disordered network of _",
    "springs_. in particular , it was found previously that they enter into the scaling of the normal mode spectrum @xcite .    in the same previous work @xcite",
    ", we also concluded that the dynamic critical exponents of fc percolation were close to but different from those of ordinary percolation , drawing this conclusion from numerical results on the fc percolation clusters which were grown from a seed site until prescribed sizes were reached . in this work , on the other hand ,",
    "we obtain numerical results on the corresponding dynamical critical exponents of fc and ifc percolation from the clusters generated statically on square grids of prescribed sizes .",
    "surprisingly , our new results indicate that the numerical values of these exponents are very similar for ordinary , fc , and ifc percolation , and in fact most likely to be the same .",
    "since the actual numerical estimates for fc cases are compatible within the error estimates of both works , this might simply mean that we drew an overzealous conclusion in our previous work .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility that the ensembles of clusters used in @xcite and the current work may contain subtle differences which in fact alter dynamic universality classes .",
    "the rest of this paper is divided into four sections . in sec .",

    "[ geometry ] with a particular focus on the sizes and distributions of the highly connected subregions .",
    "the difference between the methods of generating the cluster ensemble in @xcite and the current work is discussed in sec .",
    "[ comparison ] .",
    "the final section gives a summary of our results .",
    "we have determined the static and dynamic critical exponents of ifc percolation by simulations on a square grid .",
    "the culling of non - fully coordinated sites occurs in two stages .",
    "after sites in the grid are randomly occupied with an independent probability @xmath0 , all the fully coordinated sites are marked .",
    "after this marking process is done , all the occupied but unmarked sites are removed . from the resulting system of remaining sites ,",
    "we again determine which sites are fully coordinated and remove those which are not .",
    "[ sim_stages ] depict this process . to determine the connectivities among the sites ,",
    "we have used the standard hoshen - kopelman algorithm @xcite .",
    "= 0.90    the critical occupation probability , @xmath1 , is determined from the plot of susceptibility , @xmath2 , against @xmath0 .",
    "this plot is shown in fig .",
    "[ susceptibilities ] .",
    "notice that because of finite size effects , instead of a diverging @xmath2 at @xmath1 , we see clearly defined peaks at @xmath0 values near the true @xmath1 .",
    "the lattice sizes , @xmath3 , we used in our simulations were @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and each data point in fig .",
    "[ susceptibilities ] is an average over @xmath8 realizations . according to the plot ,",
    "the susceptibility peaks are pegged at @xmath9 for the larger lattices . since the larger the lattices the more our simulations mimic the asymptotic limit",
    ", we can conservatively assign the value for the critical occupation probability to be at @xmath10 .",
    ".the ratio between static critical exponents @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and the fractal dimension @xmath13 found for ordinary , fc and ifc percolation models are shown .",
    "the values at the bottom row of the table are previously determined values for ordinary percolation .",
    "the @xmath14 ratio for ordinary percolation is not determined in this work .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     listed in the second column of table  [ tab : dynamic ] are the @xmath15 values we found following eq .",
    "( [ walk_dim ] ) for ordinary , fc and ifc percolation .",
    "notice that there is an excellent agreement among the values for all three cases and that they agree with the previously known value for ordinary percolation .    in the third column of table  [ tab : dynamic ] are listed the @xmath16 values calculated using the alexander - orbach scaling law .",
    "although all three estimates from this work agree with the previously known value for ordinary percolation within the aggregate error estimates of our work and those of the previous work , there is a slight internal discrepancy between our own estimate of @xmath16 for ordinary percolation and that for ifc percolation .",
    "since @xmath16 is derived from @xmath13 and @xmath15 , the slight discrepancy may be attributed to the @xmath13 value we found for ifc percolation by direct simulation ( refer to the third column of table  [ tab : static ] ) .",
    "we suspect an unaccounted systematic error occuring when we perform each iteration process .",
    "in particular , as we will discuss in more details later , the length scales associated with fully - coordinated subregions appear to increase at each iteration .",
    "this suggests that we may have to increase the overall lattice length scale correspondingly in order to maintain a good estimate of the fractal dimension by direct simulation .",
    "since this was not done in this work , a systematic error may have crept in this way .",
    "previously @xcite , it was found that the number of _ interior _ sites in the largest cluster in fc percolation is much greater than that in ordinary percolation at their respective thresholds . in this work",
    "we find that this trend continues further for ifc percolation . as an illustration , consider figs .",
    "[ clusters](a ) and [ clusters](b ) . shown in fig .",
    "[ clusters](a ) is the largest cluster from a simulation of ordinary percolation on a @xmath17x@xmath17 square lattice at its percolation threshold .",
    "the darker dotted sites are _ fully - coordinated _ ( fc ) sites while the lighter gray dotted sites are _ partially - coordinated _ ( pc ) sites .",
    "fc sites are those all of whose neighbors are also occupied ( thus these are similar to , though not identical with , the _ interior _ sites considered in @xcite ) , while pc sites have at least one nearest neighbor not occupied . the same shading tone is used in fig .",
    "[ clusters](b ) except that what is shown is the largest cluster from a simulation of ifc percolation at its own percolation threshold .",
    "notice the difference in the number of fc sites in these figures .",
    "partially coordinated sites dominate in ordinary percolation while fc sites dominate in ifc percolation .    the average number of fc and pc sites in ordinary , fc , and ifc percolation are plotted in fig .  [ fcpc ] .",
    "linear least squares fits indicate that in ordinary percolation the pc sites are more than @xmath18 times as many as the fc sites , while the ratio in fc percolation is about @xmath19 , and in ifc percolation it is only about @xmath20 .",
    "a trend that can easily be seen here is that the number of fc sites increases as we progress from ordinary to fc and then to ifc percolation .",
    "although only a local full - coordination correlation is imposed , it clearly results in a change on the global scale .",
    "this may be reflected in some qualitative differences in a physical property if it is sensitive to the size of connected clusters of fc sites .",
    "for example , if a percolation model is used to describe a disordered substrate on which diffusive physics takes place ( such as in catalysis ) , what is expected within a given time scale ( or frequency range ) would be directly affected by the size of the high - connectivity or fc regions of the substrate where fast diffusion occurs compared to less well connected areas . in such cases , it is expected that there would be large differences depending on whether the appropriate percolation model to use is ordinary , fc , or ifc percolation .",
    "the latter cases could be a better representation if the culling of partially coordinated sites naturally occurs in the particular problem , say , due to desorption .",
    "= 1.0    = 1.0    = 0.90    = 0.90    = 0.75    = 0.75    = 0.75    the distribution of cluster sizes ( of all sites , i.e. , both fc and pc sites ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ tau ] . because of the finite size effects , only the intermediate size ranges ( about @xmath21 to @xmath22 sites ) are consistent with the cluster size scaling @xmath23 with the ordinary percolation value of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the cluster size and @xmath26 is the number of clusters having size @xmath25 .",
    "very small @xmath25 values are clearly out of the asymptotic scaling regime while the region of @xmath27 is also limited by the finite size of the grid .",
    "nonetheless , it is important to note that there is no significant difference between ordinary , fc , and ifc percolation for all @xmath25 above about @xmath21 .",
    "this suggests strongly that the asymptotic cluster size scaling ( which is known to occur for ordinary percolation ) also occurs for both fc and ifc percolation .    in making the plot for fig .",
    "[ tau ] , we did nt distinguish between pc and fc sites in the clusters .",
    "if we instead just consider fc sites and make a semi - log plot of the number of clusters formed by these sites against the corresponding cluster sizes , we should be able to roughly estimate the average cluster sizes formed by fc sites alone .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fc_clusters](a ) is @xmath28 against @xmath25 of clusters formed by fc sites in ordinary percolation .",
    "the line shown is not a best fitting line for all of the available points but instead one that best fits only the four middle points and is shown merely to obtain a crude idea of the typical size scale of fc clusters .",
    "for ordinary percolation , we found the average fc cluster size to be around @xmath29 fc sites . shown in figs .",
    "[ fc_clusters](b ) and [ fc_clusters](c ) are data for fc and ifc percolation , respectively .",
    "we found that around @xmath30 fc sites comprise the average cluster in fc percolation while around @xmath31 fc sites make up the average fc cluster in ifc percolation .",
    "this means that in order to map the fc and ifc percolation problems to the same length scale as ordinary percolation , a length rescaling by @xmath32 and @xmath33 must be performed , respectively .",
    "thus , although both static and dynamic critical exponents seem to remain the same as the full - coordination rules are iteratively applied , the local connectivity greatly changes or , equivalently , the length scale which would preserve the local connectivity changes .",
    "in this work , we follow the prescription described in the introduction closely in order to generate the ensemble of fc and then ifc clusters . the only limitation in the monte carlo portion of our work",
    "are that the grid we use to generate the clusters must be finite and that a particular boundary condition must be selected .",
    "our largest grid is @xmath7x@xmath7 and clearly , this is not very large by today s standards . since we use finite size scaling in the determination of both the static and dynamic critical exponents , the finiteness of the grid ( and cluster )",
    "is in fact necessary ; yet , there is always a possibility that an asymptotic regime of large sizes may not have been reached .",
    "also , we use the free boundary condition with no direct connectivity across the opposite edges of the grid , which may accentuate the finite size limitations .",
    "this type of ensemble is the most straightforward extension of the standard monte carlo simulation of ordinary percolation to the fc and ifc percolation models , and may be described as _",
    "static _ since there is no dependence on the order in which sites are generated or the connectivities checked . indeed , the static exponents @xmath11 , @xmath14 , and the like , agree closely with the corresponding ordinary static percolation values , and , if the length scale is identified with the grid edge length , then the cluster s fractal dimensions should also agree closely with that of ordinary percolation .",
    "= 0.75    in our previous work @xcite , we studied the static and dynamic critical behavior of fc percolation using the ensemble of clusters of specified number of sites , say , @xmath34 .",
    "those clusters were grown from a seed site by applying a _ breadth - first _ algorithm twice ; i.e. , first generating an ordinary percolation cluster in nearest neighbor shells to a sufficiently large size ( say , @xmath35 ) , and then identifying and joining only the fully coordinated sites in a second _ searching _ process from the same seed and then stopping the process when the size of the resulting connected cluster reaches the predetermined value @xmath34 .",
    "now , if we make the intermediate cluster of the first search process very large and if we do _ not _ terminate the second search process arbitrarily when @xmath34 is reached , but rather continue the search until the natural boundary of the fc cluster is found , then the resulting cluster ensemble should be _ exactly _ the same as that which would result in the _",
    "static _ ensemble of fc percolation clusters generated on an _ infinite _ grid . however , since the first stage is stopped at at most @xmath35 and since the second stage is forcibly stopped exactly at @xmath34 , which is a predefined value , we introduced a kinetic nature to the cluster ensemble .",
    "this may be somewhat similar to the differences in the degree of intrinsic anisotropy in static and _ kinetic _ ensemble of percolation clusters studied previously @xcite ( called _ equlibrium _ versus _ growing _ clusters there ) .",
    "an illustration of the cluster geometry differences arising between a static cluster and a growing one is shown in fig .",
    "[ generate ] . in the static ensemble ,",
    "every site of the spanning , connected component of the ordinary , fc , or ifc percolation models realizations within a given length scale @xmath36 ( defined to be the grid edge length ) is a part of the cluster . in the growing cluster ,",
    "on the other hand , only those sites which are within a certain path length along the nearest neighbor connections from the seed site are counted , independent of how close they are by straight line distance to the seed .",
    "also , since cluster size @xmath34 is the control parameter for this ensemble , the length scale @xmath36 is not precisely fixed but rather obtained as an average for a given value of @xmath34 .",
    "exactly which sites are counted in a cluster of length scale @xmath36 and which ones excluded do clearly depend on the particular search order that is employed .",
    "thus , typically , for the same @xmath36 , the number of sites of the percolating cluster is smaller in the growing cluster ensemble than in the static one .",
    "this tends to reduce both the fractal dimension @xmath13 and the walk dimension @xmath15 .",
    "if the effect is more pronounced for @xmath15 , then it may explain why an apparent measurement of the spectral dimension @xmath37 was larger for fc in the growing cluster ensemble .",
    "since the search algorithm is repeated to obtain an ifc cluster , the effect will be even larger in ifc than in fc percolation , as well as it is larger in fc than in ordinary percolation .",
    "in summary , we have introduced and studied an extension to ordinary site percolation on a square lattice which we call _ iterated fully coordinated percolation_. the static and dynamic critical behaviors of this model , as well as that of the ordinary and _ fully coordinated _ percolation models , were determined using methods such as monte carlo simulations , finite - size scaling , and normal mode analyses .",
    "all clusters used in our simulations were generated statically in grids of predetermined sizes on a square lattice , as opposed to growing them dynamically from a seed according to a dynamic rule .",
    "we found that the sizes of subregions of full connectivities in an incipient infinite cluster greatly increases as we simulate from ordinary to fully coordinated and then to iterated fully coordinated percolation .",
    "the length scales of such subregions increase by a factor of two to three with each iteration .",
    "although this implies a large increase in the local connectivities , our results also indicate that the ordinary , fully coordinated , and iterated fully coordinated percolation models have identical static and dynamic critical exponents within our statistical errors and thus we believe that they belong to the same universality class , both statically and dynamically .",
