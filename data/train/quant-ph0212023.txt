    "quantum theory and relativity theory emerged at the beginning of the twentieth century to give answers to unexplained issues in physics : the black body spectrum , the structure of atoms and nuclei , the electrodynamics of moving bodies .",
    "many years later , information theory was developed by claude shannon ( 1948 ) for analyzing the efficiency of communication methods .",
    "how do these seemingly disparate disciplines affect each other ? in this review , we shall show that they are inseparably related .",
    "common presentations of relativity theory employ fictitious observers who send and receive signals .",
    "these `` observers '' should not be thought of as human beings , but rather ordinary physical emitters and detectors .",
    "their role is to label and locate events in spacetime .",
    "the speed of transmission of these signals is bounded by @xmath0  the velocity of light  because information needs a _ material carrier _ , and the latter must obey the laws of physics .",
    "information is physical ( landauer , 1991 ) .    however , the mere existence of an upper bound on the speed of propagation of physical effects does not do justice to the fundamentally new concepts that were introduced by albert einstein ( one could as well imagine communications limited by the speed of sound , or that of the postal service ) .",
    "einstein showed that simultaneity had no absolute meaning , and that distant events might have different time orderings when referred to observers in relative motion .",
    "relativistic kinematics is all about information transfer between observers in relative motion .",
    "classical information theory involves concepts such as the rates of emission and detection of signals , and the noise power spectrum .",
    "these variables have well defined relativistic transformation properties , independent of the actual physical implementation of the communication system .",
    "a detailed analysis by jarett and cover ( 1981 ) showed that the transmission rates for observers with relative velocity @xmath1 were altered by a factor @xmath2 , namely the _",
    "square _ of the familiar doppler factor for frequencies of periodic phenomena .",
    "we shall later derive the same factor from classical electromagnetic theory , see eq .",
    "( [ doppler ] ) below .",
    "physics has a remarkably rigid theoretical structure : you can not alter any part of it without having to change everything ( weinberg , 1992 ) .",
    "einstein s theory elicited strong opposition when it was proposed , but is generally accepted by now . on the other hand ,",
    "the revolution caused by quantum theory still produces uneasy feelings among some physicists .",
    "standard texbooks on quantum mechanics tell you that observable quantities are represented by hermitian operators , their possible values are the eigenvalues of these operators , and that the probability of detecting eigenvalue @xmath3 , corresponding to eigenvector @xmath4 , is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the ( pure ) state of the quantum system that is observed . with a bit more sophistication to include mixed states , the probability can be written in a general way @xmath7 .",
    "this is nice and neat , but this does not describe what happens in real life .",
    "quantum phenomena do not occur in a hilbert space ; they occur in a laboratory .",
    "if you visit a real laboratory , you will never find there hermitian operators .",
    "all you can see are emitters ( lasers , ion guns , synchrotrons , and the like ) and appropriate detectors . in the latter , the time required for the irreversible act of amplification ( the formation of a microscopic bubble in a bubble chamber , or the initial stage of an electric discharge ) is extremely brief , typically of the order of an atomic radius divided by the velocity of light .",
    "once irreversibility has set in , the rest of the amplification process is essentially classical .",
    "it is noteworthy that the time and space needed for initiating the irreversible processes are incomparably smaller than the macroscopic resolution of the detecting equipment .",
    "the experimenter controls the emission process and observes detection events .",
    "the theorist s problem is to predict the probability of response of this or that detector , for a given emission procedure .",
    "it often happens that the preparation is unknown to the experimenter , and then the theory can be used for discriminating between different preparation hypotheses , once the detection outcomes are known .",
    "quantum mechanics tells us that whatever comes from the emitter is represented by a state @xmath8 ( a positive operator , for any state @xmath6",
    ". these operators are always hermitian . ]",
    "usually normalized to unit trace ) .",
    "detectors are represented by positive operators @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is an arbitrary label which identifies the detector .",
    "the probability that detector @xmath10 be excited is @xmath11 . a complete set of @xmath9 , including the possibility of no detection , sums up to the unit matrix and",
    "is called a _ positive operator valued measure _ ( povm ) .",
    "the various @xmath9 do not in general commute , and therefore a detection event does not correspond to what is commonly called the `` measurement of an observable . ''",
    "still , the activation of a particular detector is a macroscopic , objective phenomenon .",
    "there is no uncertainty as to which detector actually clicked .",
    "many physicists , perhaps a majority , have an intuitive realistic worldview and consider a quantum state as a physical entity",
    ". its value may not be known , but in principle the quantum state of a physical system would be well defined .",
    "however , there is no experimental evidence whatsoever to support this naive belief . on the contrary , if this view is taken seriously , it may lead to bizarre consequences , called `` quantum paradoxes . ''",
    "these so - called paradoxes originate solely from an incorrect interpretation of quantum theory .",
    "the latter is thoroughly pragmatic and , when correctly used , never yields two contradictory answers to a well posed question .",
    "it is only the misuse of quantum concepts , guided by a pseudorealistic philosophy , that leads to paradoxical results .    in this review",
    "we shall adhere to the view that @xmath8 is only a mathematical expression which encodes _ information _ about the potential results of our experimental interventions .",
    "the latter are commonly called `` measurements ''  an unfortunate terminology , which gives the impression that there exists in the real world some unknown property that we are measuring .",
    "even the very existence of particles depends on the context of our experiments . in a classic article , mott ( 1929 )",
    "wrote `` until the final interpretation is made , no mention should be made of the being a particle at all . ''",
    "drell ( 1978 ) provocatively asked `` when is a particle ? '' in particular , observers whose world lines are accelerated record different numbers of particles , as will be explained in sec .",
    "v.d ( unruh , 1976 ; wald , 1994 ) .",
    "the theory of relativity deals with the geometric structure of a four - dimensional spacetime .",
    "quantum mechanics describes properties of matter .",
    "combining these two theoretical edifices is a difficult proposition .",
    "for example , there is no way of defining a relativistic proper time for a quantum system which is spread all over space .",
    "a proper time can in principle be defined for a massive _ apparatus _ ( `` observer '' ) whose compton wavelength is so small that its center of mass has classical coordinates and follows a continuous world - line . however , when there is more than one apparatus , there is no role for the private proper times that might be attached to the observers world - lines .",
    "therefore a physical situation involving several observers in relative motion can not be described by a wave function with a relativistic transformation law ( aharonov and albert , 1981 ; peres , 1995 , and references therein ) .",
    "this should not be surprising because a wave function is not a physical object .",
    "it is only a tool for computing the probabilities of objective macroscopic events .",
    "einstein s principle of relativity asserts that there are no privileged inertial frames .",
    "this does not imply the necessity or even the possibility of using manifestly symmetric four - dimensional notations .",
    "this is _ not _ a peculiarity of relativistic quantum mechanics . likewise in classical canonical theories",
    ", time has a special role in the equations of motion .",
    "the relativity principle is extraordinarily restrictive .",
    "for example , in ordinary classical mechanics with a finite number of degrees of freedom , the requirement that the canonical coordinates * q * have the meaning of positions , so that particle trajectories @xmath12 transform like four - dimensional world lines , implies that these lines consist of straight segments .",
    "long range interactions are forbidden ; there can be only contact interactions between point particles ( currie , jordan , and sudarshan , 1963 ; leutwyler , 1965 ) .",
    "nontrivial relativistic dynamics requires an _ infinite _ number of degrees of freedom which are labelled by the spacetime coordinates ( this is called a field theory ) .",
    "combining relativity and quantum theory is not only a difficult technical question on how to formulate dynamical laws .",
    "the ontologies of these theories are radically different .",
    "classical theory asserts that fields , velocities , etc .",
    ", transform in a definite way and that the equations of motion of particles and fields behave covariantly .",
    "for example if the expression for the lorentz force is written @xmath13 in one frame , the same expression is valid in any other frame .",
    "these symbols ( @xmath14 , etc . ) have objective values .",
    "they represent entities that really exist , according to the theory . on the other hand ,",
    "wave functions are not defined in spacetime , but in a multidimensional hilbert space .",
    "they do not transform covariantly when there are interventions by external agents , as will be seen in sec .",
    "iii . only the classical parameters attached to each intervention",
    "transform covariantly . yet , in spite of the non - covariance of @xmath8 , the final results of the calculations ( the probabilities of specified sets of events ) must be lorentz invariant .    as a simple example , consider our two observers , conventionally called alice and bob , holding a pair of spin-@xmath15 particles in a singlet state .",
    "alice measures @xmath16 and finds + 1 , say .",
    "this tells her what the state of bob s particle is , namely the probabilities that bob would obtain @xmath17 if he measures ( or has measured , or will measure ) @xmath18 along any direction he chooses .",
    "this is purely counterfactual information : _ nothing _ changes at bob s location until he performs the experiment himself , or receives a message from alice telling him the result that she found . in particular , no experiment performed by bob can tell him whether alice has measured ( or will measure ) her half of the singlet .",
    "a seemingly paradoxical way of presenting these results is to ask the following naive question : suppose that alice finds that @xmath19 while bob does nothing .",
    "when does the state of bob s particle , far away , become the one for which @xmath20 with certainty ?",
    "though this question is meaningless , it may be given a definite answer : bob s particle state changes instantaneously .",
    "in which lorentz frame is this instantaneous ? in _ any _ frame !",
    "whatever frame is chosen for defining simultaneity , the experimentally observable result is the same , as can be shown in a formal way ( peres , 2000b ) .",
    "einstein himself was puzzled by what seemed to be the instantaneous transmission of quantum information . in his autobiography",
    ", he wrote the words `` telepathically '' and `` spook '' ( einstein , 1949 ) .",
    "examples like the above one , taken from relativistic quantum mechanics , manifestly have an informational nature .",
    "we can not separate the three disciplines : relativity , quantum mechanics , and information theory .      in this review , we shall often invoke the notion of _ probability_. quantum mechanics is fundamentally statistical ( ballentine , 1970 ) . in the laboratory , any experiment has to be repeated many times in order to infer a law ; in a theoretical discussion , we may imagine an infinite number of replicas of our gedankenexperiment , so as to have a genuine statistical ensemble .",
    "yet , the validity of the statistical nature of quantum theory is not restricted to situations where there are a large number of similar systems .",
    "_ statistical predictions do apply to single events .",
    "_ when we are told that the probability of precipitation tomorrow is 35% , there is only one tomorrow .",
    "this tells us that it may be advisable to carry an umbrella .",
    "probability theory is simply the quantitative formulation of how to make rational decisions in the face of uncertainty ( fuchs and peres , 2000 ) .",
    "a lucid analysis of how probabilistic concepts are incorporated into physical theories is given by emch and liu ( 2002 ) .",
    "physicists often tend to ignore the topological structure of the concepts that they use , or turn to it only as a last resort .",
    "actually , there is a `` bewildering '' multitude of topologies ( reed and simon , 1980 ) .",
    "many of them have a direct physical meaning ( emch 1972 ; haag , 1996 ; araki , 1999 ) .",
    "in particular , since measurements can actually be performed only with a finite accuracy , a finite number of outcomes , and a finite number of times , only bounded ranges of values are ever registered .",
    "suppose that we measure @xmath21 times the value @xmath22 of an observable @xmath23 , and a value @xmath24 is obtained @xmath25 times .",
    "a relative frequency @xmath26 is either used to extract a probability estimate , or it is taken at face value and interpreted as the estimate .",
    "thus the information about a state @xmath8 can be formulated as ( araki , 1999 ; peres and terno , 1998 )    inequalities induce a natural topology on the space of states , which is called a `` physical topology '' ( emch , 1972 ; araki , 1999 ) .",
    "more precisely , they define a weak- * topology on the observables and a weak topology on the states .",
    "this is a trace - norm topology , and physically acceptable states are trace class positive operators , the trace norm topology is the concrete realization of the physical topology . ]",
    "( reed and simon , 1980 ) .",
    "these structures are naturally accommodated in the algebraic approach to quantum theory .",
    "that approach consists in the characterization of the theory by a net of algebras of local observables , and is especially suited for the analysis of infinite systems in quantum statistical mechanics and quantum field theory .",
    "we will use results based on algebraic field theory in sec .",

    "work of sudarshan  ( 1961 ) , and later those of davies , kossakowski , kraus , lindblad , and lewis established the formalism of quantum mechanics of open systems , expressed by povms and completely positive maps , while works of helstrom , holevo , lebedev , and levitin , produced important results in what became quantum information theory .",
    "we shall discuss these subjects in sec .",
    "ii of this review .",
    "some trends in modern quantum information theory may be traced to security problems in quantum communication . a very early contribution was wiesner s seminal paper _",
    "conjugate coding _ , which was submitted circa 1970 to ieee transactions on information theory , and promptly rejected because it was written in a jargon incomprehensible to computer scientists ( this actually was a paper about physics , but it had been submitted to a computer science journal ) .",
    "wiesner s article was finally published ( wiesner , 1983 ) in the newsletter of acm sigact ( association for computing machinery , special interest group in algorithms and computation theory ) .",
    "that article tacitly assumed that exact duplication of an unknown quantum state was impossible , well before the no - cloning theorem ( wootters and zurek , 1982 ; dieks , 1982 ) became common knowledge .",
    "another early article , _ unforgeable subway tokens _ ( bennett , 1983 ) , also tacitly assumed the same .",
    "the standard method for quantum cryptography was invented by bennett and brassard ( 1984 ) , using two _ mutually unbiased bases _ , namely two bases such that @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the number of hilbert space dimensions .",
    "security may be improved by using three bases ( bru , 1998 ; bechmann - pasquinucci and gisin , 1999 ) , and even more by going to higher dimensions ( bechmann - pasquinucci and peres , 2000 ; bruand macchiavello 2002 ) .",
    "gisin , ribordy , tittel and zbinden ( 2002 ) recently reviewed theoretical and experimental results in quantum cryptography .",
    "a spectacular discovery was that of quantum teleportation ( bennett . , 1993 ) , which effectively turned quantum entanglement into a communication resource .",
    "soon afterwards , it also became a computational resource ( shor , 1994 ) and since then it continues to attract considerable attention .",

    "quantum channels are discussed by holevo ( 1999 ) , amosov , holevo , and werner ( 2000 ) , king and ruskai ( 2001 ) , and in the special issue of journal of mathematical physics ( 2002 ) * 43 * ( 9 )",

    "quantum mechanics is used by theorists in two different ways : it is a tool for computing accurate relationships between physical constants , such as energy levels , cross sections , transition rates , etc .",
    "these calculations are technically difficult , but they are not controversial . besides this , quantum mechanics also provides statistical predictions for results of measurements performed on physical systems that have been prepared in a specified way .",
    "the quantum measuring process is the interface of classical and quantum phenomena .",
    "the preparation and measurement are performed by macroscopic devices , and these are described in classical terms .",

''",
    "bohr was concerned with _ information _ , in the broadest sense of this term .",
    "he never said that there were classical systems or quantum systems .",
    "there were physical systems , for which it was appropriate to use the classical language or the quantum language .",
    "there is no guarantee that either language gives a perfect description , but in a well designed experiment it should be at least a good approximation .",
    "bohr s approach divides the physical world into `` endosystems '' ( finkelstein , 1988 ) that are described by quantum dynamics , and `` exosystems '' ( such as measuring apparatuses ) that are not described by the dynamical formalism of the endosystem under consideration .",
    "a physical system is called `` open '' when parts of the universe are excluded from its description . in different lorentz frames used by observers in relative motion , different parts of the universe may be excluded .",
    "the systems considered by these observers are then essentially different , and no lorentz transformation exists that can relate them ( peres and terno , 2002 ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that bohr never described the measuring process as a dynamical interaction between an exophysical apparatus and the system under observation .",
    "he was of course fully aware that measuring apparatuses are made of the same kind of matter as everything else , and they obey the same physical laws .",
    "it is therefore tempting to use quantum theory in order to investigate their behavior during a measurement .",
    "however , if this is done , the quantized apparatus loses its status of a measuring instrument .",
    "it becomes a mere intermediate system in the measuring process , and there must still be a _",
    "final _ instrument that has a purely classical description ( bohr , 1939 ) .",
    "measurement was understood by bohr as a primitive notion .",
    "he could thereby elude questions which caused considerable controversy among other authors",
    ". a quantum dynamical description of the measuring process was first attempted by john von neumann , in his treatise on the mathematical foundations of quantum theory ( 1932 ) . in the last section of that book , as in an afterthought , von neumann represented the apparatus by a single degree of freedom , whose value was correlated to that of the dynamical variable being measured .",
    "such an apparatus is not , in general , left in a definite pure state , and it does not admit a classical description .",
    "therefore , von neumann introduced a second apparatus which observes the first one , and possibly a third apparatus , and so on , until there is a final measurement , which is _ not _ described by quantum dynamics and has a definite result ( for which quantum mechanics can only give statistical predictions ) .",
    "the essential point that was suggested , but not proved by von neumann , is that the introduction of this sequence of apparatuses is irrelevant : the final result is the same , irrespective of the location of the `` cut '' between classical and quantum physics .",
    "these different approaches of bohr and von neumann were reconciled by hay and peres ( 1998 ) , who introduced a dual description for the measuring apparatus .",
    "it obeys quantum mechanics while it interacts with the system under observation , and then it is `` dequantized '' and is described by a classical liouville density which provides the probability distribution for the results of the measurement .",
    "alternatively , the apparatus may always be treated by quantum mechanics , and be measured by a second apparatus which has such a dual description .",
    "the question raised by hay and peres is whether these two different methods of calculation give the same result , or at least asymptotically agree under suitable conditions .",
    "they showed that a sufficient condition for agreement between the two methods is that the dynamical variable used as a `` pointer '' by the first apparatus be represented by a `` quasi - classical '' operator of the weyl - wigner type ( hillery , 1984 ) .    to avoid any misunderstanding , we emphasize that the classical description of a pointer is not by means of a point in phase space , but by a _",
    "liouville density_. quantum theory makes only statistical predictions , and any semiclassical treatment that simulates it must also be statistical .",
    "dirac ( 1947 ) wrote `` a measurement always causes the system to jump into an eigenstate of the dynamical variable being measured . '' here , we must be careful : a quantum jump ( also called _ collapse _ ) is something that happens in our description of the system , not to the system itself .",
    "likewise , the time dependence of the wave function does not represent the evolution of a physical system .",
    "it only gives the evolution of probabilities for the outcomes of potential experiments on that system ( fuchs and peres , 2000 ) .",
    "let us examine more closely the measuring process .",
    "first , we must refine the notion of measurement and extend it to a more general one : an _ intervention_. an intervention is described by a set of parameters which include the location of the intervention in spacetime , referred to an arbitrary coordinate system .",
    "we also have to specify the speed and orientation of the apparatus in the coordinate system that we are using , and various other input parameters that control the apparatus , such as the strength of a magnetic field , or that of an rf pulse used in the experiment .",
    "the input parameters are determined by classical information received from past interventions , or they may be chosen arbitrarily by the observer who prepares that intervention , or by a local random device acting in lieu of the observer .",
    "an intervention has two consequences .",
    "one is the acquisition of information by means of an apparatus that produces a record .",
    "this is the `` measurement . ''",
    "its outcome , which is in general unpredictable , is the output of the intervention .",
    "the other consequence is a change of the environment in which the quantum system will evolve after completion of the intervention . for example the intervening apparatus may generate a new hamiltonian which depends on the recorded result .",
    "in particular , classical signals may be emitted for controlling the execution of further interventions .",
    "these signals are of course limited to the velocity of light .",
    "the experimental protocols that we consider all start in the same way , with the same initial state @xmath29 , and the first intervention is the same .",
    "however , later stages of the experiment may involve different types of interventions , possibly with different spacetime locations , depending on the outcomes of the preceding events . yet , assuming that each intervention has only a finite number of outcomes , there is for the entire experiment only a finite number of possible records .",
    "( here , the word `` record '' means the complete list of outcomes that occurred during the experiment .",
    "we do not want to use the word `` history '' which has acquired a different meaning in the writings of some quantum theorists . )",
    "each one of these records has a definite probability in the statistical ensemble . in the laboratory",
    ", experimenters can observe its relative frequency among all the records that were obtained ; when the number of records tends to infinity , this relative frequency is expected to tend to the true probability .",
    "the aim of theory is to predict the probability of each record , given the inputs of the various interventions ( both the inputs that are actually controlled by the local experimenter and those determined by the outputs of earlier interventions ) .",
    "each record is objective : everyone agrees on what happened ( e.g. , which detectors clicked ) .",
    "therefore , everyone agrees on what the various relative frequencies are , and the theoretical probabilities are also the same for everyone .",
    "interventions are localized in spacetime , but quantum systems are pervasive . in each experiment , irrespective of its history , there is only one quantum system , which may consist of several particles or other subsystems , created or annihilated at the various interventions . note that all these properties still hold if the measurement outcome is the _ absence _ of a detector click . it does not matter whether this is due to an imperfection of the detector or to a probability @xmath30 that a perfect detector would be excited .",
    "the state of the quantum system does not remain unchanged .",
    "it has to change to respect unitarity .",
    "the mere presence of a detector that could have been excited implies that there has been an interaction between that detector and the quantum system . even if the detector has a finite probability of remaining in its initial state , the quantum system correlated to the latter acquires a different state ( dicke , 1981 ) .",
    "the absence of a click , when there could have been one , is also an event .",
    "interventions , as defined above , start by an interaction with a measuring apparatus , called `` premeasurement '' ( peres , 1980 ) . the quantum system and the apparatus",
    "are initially in a state @xmath31 , and become entangled into a single composite system : _",
    "s c_s|s|a _ s , c_su_s|,[premea ] where @xmath32 is a complete basis for the states of .",
    "it is the choice of the unitary matrix @xmath33 that determines which property of the system under study is correlated to the apparatus , and therefore is measured .",
    "when writing the above equation , we tacitly assumed that the quantum system and the measuring apparatus were initially in a pure state .",
    "since a mixed state is a convex combination of pure states , no new feature can result from taking mixed states ( which would admittedly be more realistic ) .",
    "relativistic restrictions on the allowed forms of @xmath33 will be discussed in sec .",
    "the measuring process involves not only the physical system under study and a measuring apparatus ( which together form the composite system ) but also their `` environment '' which includes unspecified degrees of freedom of the apparatus and the rest of the world .",
    "these unknown degrees of freedom interact with the relevant ones , but they are not under the control of the experimenter and can not be explicitly described .",
    "our partial ignorance is not a sign of weakness .",
    "it is fundamental .",
    "if everything were known , acquisition of information would be a meaningless concept .",
    "a complete description of  involves both macroscopic and microscopic variables .",
    "the difference between them is that the environment can be considered as adequately isolated from the microscopic degrees of freedom for the duration of the experiment and is not influenced by them , while _ the environment is not isolated from the macroscopic degrees of freedom_. for example , if there is a macroscopic pointer , air molecules bounce from it in a way that depends on the position of that pointer .",
    "even if we can neglect the brownian motion of a massive pointer , its influence on the environment leads to the phenomenon of decoherence , which is inherent to the measuring process .",
    "an essential property of the composite system , which is necessary to produce a meaningful measurement , is that its states form a finite number of orthogonal subspaces which are distinguishable by the observer .",
    "each macroscopically distinguishable subspace corresponds to one of the outcomes of the intervention and defines a povm element @xmath9 , given explicitly by eq .",
    "( [ emu ] ) below .",
    "let us therefore introduce a complete basis for , namely @xmath34 , where @xmath10 labels a macroscopic subspace , and @xmath35 labels microscopic states in that subspace .      up to now",
    ", the quantum evolution is well defined and it is in principle reversible .",
    "it would remain so if the environment could be perfectly isolated from the macroscopic degrees of freedom of the apparatus .",
    "this demand is of course self - contradictory , since we have to read the result of the measurement if we wish to make any use of it .",
    "a detailed analysis of the interaction with the environment , together with plausible hypotheses ( peres , 2000a ) , shows that states of the environment that are correlated to subspaces of  with different labels @xmath10 can be treated as if they were orthogonal .",
    "this is an excellent _ approximation _ ( physics is not an exact science , it is a science of approximations ) .",
    "the resulting theoretical predictions will almost always be correct , and if any rare small deviation from them is ever observed , it will be considered as a statistical quirk , or an experimental error .",
    "the density matrix of the quantum system thus is effectively block - diagonal and all our statistical predictions are identical to those obtained for an ordinary mixture of ( unnormalized ) pure states    the square of its norm . this process is called decoherence .",
    "each subspace @xmath10 is stable under decoherence  it is their relative phase that decoheres . from this moment on , the macroscopic degrees of freedom of  have entered into the classical domain .",
    "we can safely observe them and `` lay on them our grubby hands '' ( caves , 1982 ) .",
    "in particular , they can be used to trigger amplification mechanisms ( the so - called detector clicks ) for the convenience of the experimenter .",
    "some authors claim that decoherence may provide a solution of the `` measurement problem , '' with the particular meaning that they attribute to that problem ( zurek , 1991 ) .",
    "others dispute this point of view in their comments on the above article ( zurek , 1993 ) .",
    "a reassessment of this issue and many important technical details were recently published by zurek ( 2002 , 2003 ) . yet",
    ", decoherence has an essential role , as explained above .",
    "it is essential to distinguish decoherence , which results from the disturbance of the environment by the apparatus ( and is a quantum effect ) , from _ noise _ , which would result from the disturbance of the system or the apparatus by the environment and would cause errors .",
    "noise is a mundane classical phenomenon , which we ignore in this review .",
    "the final step of the intervention is to discard part of the composite system .",
    "the discarded part may depend on the outcome @xmath10 .",
    "we therefore introduce in the subspace @xmath10 two sets of basis vectors @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the new system and the part that is discarded , respectively .",
    "we thus obtain for the new system a reduced density matrix ( _)_=_m_s , t ( a_m)_s_st(a_m^*)_t , [ rhomu ] where @xmath38 is the initial state , and the notation ( a_m)_su_sm , [ au ] was introduced for later convenience . recall that the indices @xmath39 and @xmath18 refer to the original system under study and to the final one , respectively . omitting these indices , ) takes the familiar form _=_m a_ma_m^ , [ arhoa ] where @xmath10 is a label that indicates which detector was involved and the label @xmath40 refers to any subsystem that was discarded at the conclusion of the interaction .",
    "clearly , the `` quantum jump '' @xmath41 is not a dynamical process that occurs in the quantum system by itself .",
    "it results from the introduction of an apparatus , followed by its deletion or that of another subsystem .",
    "a jump in the quantum state occurs even when there is no detector click or other macroscopic amplification , because we impose abrupt changes in our way of delimiting the object that we consider as the quantum system under study .",
    "the initial @xmath8 is usually assumed to be normalized to unit trace , and the trace of @xmath42 is the probability of occurrence of outcome @xmath10 . note that each symbol @xmath43 in the above equation represents a _ matrix _ ( not a matrix element ) .",
    "explicitly , the kraus operators @xmath43 ( kraus , 1983 ) are given by eq .",

    "equation ( [ arhoa ] ) is sometimes written @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is a linear _ superoperator _ which acts on density matrices like ordinary operators act on pure states .",
    "note however that these superoperators have a very special structure , explicitly given by eq .",

    "it is noteworthy that eq .",
    "( [ arhoa ] ) is the most general completely positive linear map ( stinespring , 1955 ; davies , 1976 ; kraus , 1983 ) .",

    "if we have two systems , it is physically meaningless to reverse the direction of time for only one of them .",
    "one can write a formal expression for this impossible process , but the resulting `` density matrix '' is unphysical because it may have negative eigenvalues ( peres , 1996 ) . the case for consideration of completely positive maps",

    "where the povm elements @xmath9 commute , they are orthogonal projection operators , and the povm becomes a _ projection valued measure _ ( pvm ) .",

    "even these apparently simple notions lead to non - trivial results .",

    "see walgate and hardy ( 2002 ) .",
    "a classification of bipartite state transformations was introduced by beckman  ( 2001 ) .",

    "there are _ localizable _ operations that can be implemented locally by alice and bob , possibly with the help of prearranged entangled auxiliary systems ( ancillas ) , but without classical comunication .",

    "the requirement of no communication is relaxed and one - way classical communication is possible .",
    "it is obvious that any tensor - product operation @xmath59 is localizable .",
    "the converse is not always true , for example in bell measurements ( braunstein , mann , and revzen , 1992 ) which distinguish between the four standard bipartite entangled states ,     other classes of bipartite operations are defined as follows : bob performs a local operation @xmath60 just before the global operation @xmath56 . if no local operation of alice can reveal any information about @xmath60 , _",

    "semicausal_. if the operation is semicausal in both directions , it is called _",
    "causal_.    in many cases it is easier to prove causality than localizability .",
    "to check the causality of an operation @xmath56 whose outcomes are the states @xmath61 with probabilities @xmath62 , it is enough to consider the corresponding superoperator t():=_t _ ( ) .",
    "indeed , assume that bob s action prior to the global operation leads to one of the two different states @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "then the states @xmath65 and @xmath66 are distinguishable if and only if some of the pairs of states @xmath67 and @xmath68 are distinguishable . such probabilistic distinguishability shows that the operation @xmath56 is not semicausal .",
    "these definitions of causal and localizable operators appear equivalent .",
    "it is easily proved that localizable operators are causal .",
    "it was shown that semicausal operators are always semilocalizable ( eggeling , schlingemann , and werner , 2002 ) . however , there are causal operations that are not localizable ( beckman , 2001 ) .",
    "it is curious that while a complete bell measurement is causal , the two - outcome incomplete bell measurement is not ( sorkin , 1993 ) . indeed ,",
    "consider a two - outcome pvm e_1=|^+^+| , e_2=-e_1 , where @xmath69 ( and the kraus matrices are the projectors @xmath9 themselves ) .",
    "if the initial state is @xmath70 , then the outcome that is associated with @xmath71 always occurs and alice s reduced density matrix after the measurement is @xmath72 . on the other hand ,",

    "it can be shown that two input states @xmath73 and @xmath70 after this incomplete bell measurement are distinguished by alice with a probability of 0.75 .",
    "here is another example of a semicausal and semilocalizable measurement which can be executed with one - way classical communication from alice to bob . consider a pvm measurement , whose complete orthogonal projectors are |0|0 , |0|1 , |1|+ , |1|- , [ examp1 ] where @xmath75 .",

    "quantum measurements are usually considered as quasi - instantaneous processes . in particular , they affect the wave function instantaneously throughout the entire configuration space . measurements of finite duration ( peres and wootters , 1985 ) make no essential difference in this respect . is this quasi - instantaneous change of the quantum state , caused by a local intervention of an exophysical agent , consistent with relativity theory ?",
    "the answer is not obvious .",
    "the wave function itself is not a material object forbidden to travel faster than light , but we may still ask how the dynamical evolution of an extended quantum system that undergoes several measurements in distant spacetime regions is described in different lorentz frames .    difficulties were pointed out long ago by bloch ( 1967 ) , aharonov and albert ( 1981 , 1984 ) , and many others ( peres , 1995 and references therein ) . still before them , in the very early years of quantum mechanics , bohr and rosenfeld ( 1933 ) had given a complete relativistic theory of the measurement of quantum _ fields _ , but these authors were not concerned about the properties of the new quantum states that resulted from these measurements and their work does not answer the question that was raised above .",
    "other authors ( scarani , 2000 ; zbinden , 2001 ) considered detectors in relative motion , and therefore at rest in different lorentz frames .",
    "these works also do not give an explicit answer to the above question : a detector in uniform motion is just as good as one that has undergone an ordinary spatial rotation .",
    "( accelerated detectors involve new physical phenomena , see sec .  [ unruh ] . )",
    "the point is not how individual detectors happen to move , but how the effects due to these detectors are described in different ways in one lorentz frame or another .    to become fully relativistic ,",
    "the notion of intervention requires some refinement .",
    "the precise location of an intervention , which is important in a relativistic discussion , is the point from which classical information is sent that may affect the input of other interventions .",
    "more precisely , it is the earliest small region of spacetime from which classical information could have been sent .",
    "moreover , in the conventional presentation of non - relativistic quantum mechanics , each intervention has a ( finite ) number of outcomes , for example , this or that detector clicks . in a relativistic treatment ,",
    "the spatial separation of the detectors is essential and each detector corresponds to a different intervention .",
    "the reason is that if several detectors are set up so that they act at a given time in one lorentz frame , they would act at different times in another lorentz frame .",
    "however , a knowledge of the time ordering of events is essential in our dynamical calculations , so that we want the parameters of an intervention to refer unambiguously to only one time ( indeed to only one spacetime `` point '' ) .",
    "therefore , an intervention can involve only one detector and it can have only two possible outcomes : either there was a `` click '' or there was nt .",
    "what is the role of relativity theory here ?",
    "we may likewise ask what is the role of translation and/or rotation invariance in a nonrelativistic theory .",
    "the point is that the rules for computing quantum probabilities involve explicitly the spacetime coordinates of the interventions .",
    "lorentz invariance ( or rotational invariance , as a special case ) says that if the classical spacetime coordinates are subjected to a particular linear transformation , then the probabilities remain the same .",
    "this invariance is not trivial because the rule for computing the probability of occurrence of a given record involves a sequence of mathematical operations corresponding to the time ordered set of all the relevant interventions .",
    "if we only consider the euclidean group , all we have to know is how to transform the classical parameters , and the wave function , and the various operators , under translations and rotations of the coordinates .",
    "however , when we consider genuine lorentz transformations , we have not only to lorentz - transform the above symbols , but we are faced with a new problem : the natural way of calculating the result of a sequence of interventions , namely by considering them in chronological order , is different for different inertial frames . the issue is not only a matter of covariance of the symbols at each intervention and between consecutive interventions .",
    "there are genuinely different prescriptions for choosing the sequence of mathematical operations in our calculation .",
    "therefore these different orderings ought to give the same set of probabilities , and this demand is not trivial .",

    "often these detectors are stripped to only a few discrete degrees of freedom ( unruh and wald , 1984 ; levin , peleg and peres , 1992 ; wald , 1994 ) .",
    "an external probe which is not described by field theory and whose coupling to the fields of interest is arbitrarily adjustable is obviously an idealization .",
    "beckman  ( 2001 ) assert that if the probe variables are `` heavy , '' with rapidly decaying correlations and the field variables are `` light , '' then this idealization is credible .",
    "still , causality requirements like the absence of signalling should be checked for any proposed measurement scheme ( sec .",
    "[ no - com ] also discusses causality requirements ) .",
    "consider again the descriptions of the eprb gedankenexperiment in two coordinate systems in relative motion .",
    "there exists a lorentz transformation connecting the initial states @xmath29 and @xmath104 before the two interventions , and likewise there is a lorentz transformation connecting the final states @xmath94 and @xmath105 after completion of the two interventions . on the other hand , there is no lorentz transformation relating the states at intermediate times that are not in the past or future of _ both _ interventions ( peres , 2000b ) .",
    "the various kraus operators , acting at different times , appear in different orders .",
    "nevertheless the overall transition from initial to final state is lorentz invariant ( peres , 2001 ) .    in the time interval between the two interventions , _",
    "nothing _ actually happens in the real world .",
    "it is only in our mathematical calculations that there is a deterministic evolution of the state of the quantum system .",
    "this evolution is _ not _ a physical process .",
    "what distinguishes the intermediate evolution _ between _ interventions from the one occurring _ at _",
    "an intervention is the unpredictability of the outcome of the latter : either there is a click or there is no click of the detector .",

    "phenomena like those illustrated in fig .  1 are often attributed to `` quantum nonlocality '' and have led some authors to speculate on the possibility of superluminal communication ( actually , instantaneous communication ) .",
    "one of these proposals ( herbert , 1981 ) looked reasonably serious and arose enough interest to lead to investigations disproving this possibility ( glauber , 1986 ) and in particular to the discovery of the no - cloning theorem ( wootters and zurek , 1982 ; dieks , 1982 ) .",
    "let us examine more closely the origin of these claims of nonlocality .",
    "bell s theorem ( 1964 ) asserts that it is impossible to mimic quantum theory by introducing a set of objective _ local _ `` hidden '' variables .",
    "it follows that any classical imitation of quantum mechanics is necessarily nonlocal .",
    "however bell s theorem does not imply the existence of any nonlocality in quantum theory itself .",
    "in particular relativistic quantum field theory is manifestly local .",
    "the simple and obvious fact is that information has to be carried by _",
    "material objects _ , quantized or not .",
    "therefore quantum measurements do not allow any information to be transmitted faster than the characteristic velocity that appears in the green s functions of the particles emitted in the experiment . in a lorentz invariant theory , this limit is the velocity of light .    in summary",
    ", relativistic causality can not be violated by quantum measurements . the only physical assumption that is needed to prove this assertion is that lorentz transformations of the spacetime coordinates are implemented in quantum theory by _ unitary _ transformations of the various operators .",
    "this is the same as saying that the lorentz group is a valid symmetry of the physical system ( weinberg , 1995 ) .",
    "are relativity and quantum theory really involved in these issues ?",
    "the matter of information transfer by means of distant measurements is essentially nonrelativistic .",
    "replace `` superluminal '' by `` supersonic '' and the argument is exactly the same .",
    "the maximal speed of communication is determined by the dynamical laws that govern the physical infrastructure .",
    "in quantum field theory , the field excitations are called `` particles '' and their speed over macroscopic distances can not exceed the speed of light . in condensed matter physics , linear excitations are called phonons and the maximal speed is that of sound .    as to the eprb setup ,",
    "consider an analogous classical situation : a bomb , initially at rest , explodes into two fragments carrying opposite angular momenta .",
    "alice and bob , far away from each other , measure arbitrarily chosen components of @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "( they can measure all the components , since these have objective values . ) yet , bob s measurement tells him nothing of what alice did , nor even whether she did anything at all .",
    "he can only know with certainty what _ would _ be the result found by alice _ if _ she measures her * j * along the same direction as him , and make statistical inferences for other possible directions of alice s measurement .",
    "the classical - quantum analogy becomes complete if we use classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the distribution of bomb fragments is given by a liouville function in phase space .",
    "when alice measures @xmath108 , the liouville function for @xmath109 is instantly altered , however far bob is from alice .",
    "no one finds this surprising , since it is universally agreed that a liouville function is only a mathematical tool representing our statistical knowledge . likewise , the wave function @xmath6 , or the corresponding wigner function ( wigner , 1932 ) which is the quantum analogue of a liouville function , are no more than mathematical tools for computing probabilities .",
    "it is only when they are regarded as physical objects that superluminal paradoxes arise .",
    "the essential difference between the classical and quantum functions which change instantaneously as the result of measurements is that the classical liouville function is attached to objective properties that are only imperfectly known . on the other hand , in the quantum case",
    ", the probabilities are attached to _ potential _ outcomes of mutually incompatible experiments , and these outcomes do not exist `` out there '' without the actual interventions .",
    "unperformed experiments have no results .",
    "in our discussion of the measuring process , decoherence was attributed to the unability of accounting explicitly for the degrees of freedom of the environment .",
    "the environment thus behaves an exosystem ( finkelstein , 1988 ) and the system of interest is `` open '' because parts of the universe are excluded from its description .",
    "this leads to the introduction of reduced density matrices : let us use latin indices for the description of the exosystem ( that is , if we were able to give it a description ) and greek indices for the subsystem that we can actually describe .",
    "the components of a state vector would thus be written @xmath110 and those of a density matrix @xmath111 .",
    "the reduced density matrix of the system of interest is given by _",
    "= _ m _ m , m .",
    "[ tau ] even if @xmath8 is a pure state ( a matrix of rank one ) , @xmath112 is in general a mixed state .",
    "its _ entropy _ is defined as s=- ( ) .    in a relativistic system ,",
    "whatever is outside the past light cone of the observer is unknown to him , but also can not affect his system , therefore does not lead to decoherence ( here , we assume that no particle emitted by an exosystem located outside the past cone penetrates into the future cone . )",
    "since observers located at different points have different past light cones , they exclude from their descriptions different parts of spacetime .",
    "therefore any transformation law between them must tacitly assume that the part excluded by one observer is irrelevant to the system of the other observer .",
    "another consequence of relativity is that there is a hierarchy of dynamical variables : _ primary variables _ have relativistic transformation laws that depend only on the lorentz transformation matrix @xmath113 that acts on the spacetime coordinates .",
    "for example , momentum components are primary variables . on the other hand , _ secondary variables _ such as spin and polarization have transformation laws that depend not only on @xmath113 , but also on the momentum of the particle . as a consequence ,",
    "the reduced density matrix for secondary variables , which may be well defined in any coordinate system , has no transformation law relating its values in different lorentz frames .",

    "that equation may be meaningless if it conflicts with constraints imposed on the physical states ( beckman , 2002 ; peres and terno , 2003 ) . in the absence of a general prescription ,",

    "we first consider the relativistic properties of the spin entropy for a single , free particle of spin  and mass @xmath114 .",
    "we shall show that the usual definition of quantum entropy has no invariant meaning .",
    "the reason is that under a lorentz boost , the spin undergoes a wigner rotation ( wigner , 1939 ; halpern , 1968 ) whose direction and magnitude depend on the momentum of the particle .",
    "even if the initial state is a direct product of a function of momentum and a function of spin , the transformed state is not a direct product .",
    "spin and momentum appear to be entangled .",
    "( this is not the familiar type of entanglement which can be used for quantum communication , because both degrees of freedom belong to the same particle , not to distinct subsystems that could be widely separated . )    the quantum state of a spin-  particle can be written , in the momentum representation , as a two - component spinor , ( ) = a_1()a_2 ( ) , [ psi0 ] where the amplitudes @xmath115 satisfy @xmath116 .",
    "the normalization of these amplitudes is a matter of convenience , depending on whether we prefer to include a factor in it , or to have such factors in the transformation law ( [ tf ] ) below . following halpern ( 1968 )",
    ", we shall use the second alternative , because it is closer to the nonrelativistic notation which appears in the usual definition of entropy . in this section ,",
    "we use natural units : @xmath117 .    here",
    "we emphasize that we consider normalizable states , in the momentum representation , not momentum eigenstates as usual in textbooks on particle physics .",
    "the latter are chiefly concerned with the computation of @xmath118 matrix elements needed to obtain cross sections and other asymptotic properties . however , in general a particle has no definite momentum .",
    "for example , if an electron is elastically scattered by some target , the electron state after the scattering is a superposition that involves momenta in all directions .    in that case",
    ", it still is formally possible to ask , in any lorentz frame , what is the value of a spin component in a given direction ( this is a legitimate hermitian operator ) . in quantum information theory",
    ", the important issue does not reside in asymptotic properties , but how entanglement ( a communication resource ) is defined by different observers .",
    "early papers on this subject used momentum eigenstates , just as in particle physics ( czachor , 1997 ) .",
    "however , radically new properties arise when localized quantum states are considered .",
    "let us define a reduced density matrix , @xmath119 , giving statistical predictions for the results of measurements of spin components by an ideal apparatus which is not affected by the momentum of the particle .",
    "the spin entropy is s=-()=-_j_j , where @xmath120 are the eigenvalues of @xmath112 .",
    "as usual , ignoring some degrees of freedom leaves the others in a mixed state .",
    "what is not obvious is that in the present case the amount of mixing depends on the lorentz frame used by the observer .",
    "indeed consider another observer ( bob ) who moves with a constant velocity with respect to alice who prepared state ( [ psi0 ] ) . in the lorentz frame where bob is at rest",
    ", the same spin-  particle has a state ()=a_1()a_2 ( ) . the transformation law is ( weinberg , 1995 ) a()=[(^-1p)_0/p_0]^1/2_s d_rs[,(^-1p)]a_s(^-1p ) [ tf ] , where @xmath121 is the wigner rotation matrix for a lorentz transformation @xmath113 .",
    "further details of this transformation and its representation by a quantum circuit are given in appendix a.    as an example , take a particle prepared by alice with spin in the @xmath83 direction , so that @xmath122 . spin and momentum are not entangled , and the spin entropy is zero .",
    "when that particle is described in bob s lorentz frame , moving with velocity @xmath123 in a direction at an angle @xmath124 with alice s @xmath83-axis , a detailed calculation shows that both @xmath125 and @xmath126 are nonzero , so that the spin entropy is positive ( peres , scudo , and terno , 2002 ) .",

    "how is the linearity of the transformation laws lost in this purely quantum mechanical problem ?",

    "it is the absence of _ any _ definite transformation law which depends only on the lorentz matrix .",
    "it is noteworthy that a similar situation arises for a classical system whose state is given in any lorentz frame by a liouville function ( balescu and kotera , 1967 ) . recall that a liouville function expresses our probabilistic description of a classical system  what we can predict before we perform an actual observation  just as a quantum state is a mathematical expression used for computing probabilities of events .    to avoid any misunderstanding",

    "a complete liouville function , or rather liouville functional , must therefore contain not only all the canonical variables @xmath130 and @xmath131 , but also all the fields .",
    "however , once this liouville functional is known ( in principle ) , we can define from it a reduced liouville function , by integrating the functional over all the degrees of freedom of the fields .",
