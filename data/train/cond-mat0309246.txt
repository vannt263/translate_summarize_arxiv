    "the stoichiometric , self - doped oxide spinels lim@xmath0o@xmath1 ( with m = ti , v and mn ) can be said to constitute a periodic `` hall of fame '' . in all of them , li is monovalent and the oxygen ion , negative and divalent ; this means that the transition metal oxidation state is formally 3.5 + .",
    "the number of @xmath8 electrons per transition metal atom would therefore be 0.5 , 1.5 , 2.5 or 3.5 when m = ti , v , cr or mn respectively .",
    "liti@xmath0o@xmath1 is a superconductor with a @xmath9 of 12 k. when first prepared in 1973 @xcite it was described as a high temperature superconductor .",
    "along with babi@xmath10pb@xmath11o@xmath12 @xcite , it was amongst the only oxide superconductors with @xmath13 k until the advent of the layered cuprates .",
    "it is also the _ only _ metallic oxide spinel known .",
    "its neighbor , liv@xmath0o@xmath1 is already on the verge of localization , and as a result , displays heavy - fermion behavior @xcite  one of the few systems without @xmath14 electrons that is known to do so  limn@xmath0o@xmath1 , one more member from this family , is not only a very important cathode material in secondary li - ion batteries @xcite , but also displays charge - ordering @xcite , associated with half - integral charge that can order over two distinct sites .",
    "indeed , the well - known verweij transition in ferrite associated with the ordering of charge on the spinel lattice @xcite can perhaps be best understood by examining limn@xmath0o@xmath1 . near the charge - ordering temperature of this compound , a magnetic field can influence electrical transport and this translates to negative magnetoresistence @xcite .",
    "conspicuous in this list by its absence is the spinel licr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "attempts to prepare this compound are fraught with the difficulty of stabilizing cr in a formal oxidation state that is somewhere between 3 + and 4 + .",
    "indeed ferromagnetic cro@xmath0 with the rutile structure is well known to require high oxygen partial pressures for its preparation .",
    "cro@xmath0 decomposes at ambient oxygen partial pressures when the temperature exceeds 473 k @xcite .",
    "given that ( i ) the isostructural compounds neighboring licr@xmath0o@xmath1 are so interesting , and ( ii ) the structure and oxidation state of licr@xmath0o@xmath1 are reminiscent of cro@xmath0 , the prototypic oxide half - metal @xcite , we thought the compound licr@xmath0o@xmath1 worthy of study .",
    "in this work , we use spin - polarized first principles density functional calculations within two different schemes : full potential linearized augmented plane - wave calculations @xcite that permit an optimization of the geometry of the cubic spinel compound ( lattice parameter and internal structural parameter ) and linear muffin tin orbital ( lmto ) calculations @xcite which are geared to the visualization of spin - resolved bonding .",
    "the electronic structure of licr@xmath0o@xmath1 is compared with that of rutile cro@xmath0 , lim@xmath0o@xmath1 ( m = ti , v and mn ) , and znv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the parameter space of half - metallicity in licr@xmath0o@xmath1 is mapped out in terms of the two structural parameters .",
    "the cubic spinel crystal structure ab@xmath0o@xmath1 is completely described by two parameters , the cubic cell parameter @xmath15 , and the internal oxygen positional parameter @xmath16 where @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the a atoms ( li ) occupy tetrahedral sites created by a network of bo@xmath18 octahedra where b is here a transition metal .",
    "the octahedra of oxygen around b are perfectly regular when @xmath19 .",
    "deviations @xmath20 , @xmath21 indicate either a trigonal expansion ( @xmath22 ) or compression ( @xmath23 ) , achieved by pushing two opposite triangular faces of the octahedron apart or together .",
    "the b atom sublattice ( cr in licr@xmath0o@xmath1 ) comprises a network of b@xmath1 tetrahedra . because the b atoms form tetrahedra , antiferromagnetic ordering is frustrated on the b site of the spinel @xcite in a manner reminiscent of the residual entropy problem in the crystal structure of ice i__h _ _ @xcite .",
    "various views of the spinel crystal structure , and the structure of rutile cro@xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "scalar - relativistic kohn - sham equations were solved taking all relativistic effects into account except for the spin - orbit coupling .",
    "we performed both full potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( lapw ) calculations based on the wien97 and wien2k codes @xcite as well as linear muffin - tin orbital ( lmto ) calculations @xcite within the atomic sphere approximation ( asa ) where we used the stuttgart tb - lmto - asa program @xcite .",
    "the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the calculation of exchange correlation was considered following the perdew - burke - ernzerhof @xcite parameterization for the lapw calculations and the perdew - wang prescription @xcite for the lmto calculation@xcite .    in our lapw calculations we considered twenty inequivalent sampling @xmath24 points and the modified tetrahedron method @xcite for the brillouin zone integration during the self - consistent iterations . in order to test the accuracy of the sampling",
    ", we also performed calculations with up to 120 and 195 irreducible @xmath24-points without observing significant qualitative changes in the results apart that some spikes in the density of states plots get rounded .",
    "we set the energy threshold between core and valence states at -6 ryd @xcite .",
    "for the number of plane waves , the criterion used was rmt ( muffin - tin radius ) @xmath25 @xmath26 ( for the plane waves ) = 8 .",
    "we considered various sets of muffin - tin radii to ensure well converged spin - polarized calculations .    in our lmto calculations",
    "256 irreducible @xmath24 points were used in the primitive wedge of the bz .",
    "space filling in the unit cell of licr@xmath0o@xmath1 was ensured through the use of two empty spheres with bases of @xmath27 and @xmath28 orbitals at ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) and ( @xmath29 , 1/8 , 1/8 ) where the value of @xmath29 is set automatically by the code according to the oxygen position .",
    "lmto electronic structures were analyzed by calculating crystal orbital hamiltonian populations ( cohps ) @xcite which are densities of states weighted by appropriate hamiltonian matrix elements .",
    "cohps are indicative of the strength and nature of a bonding ( positive cohp ) or antibonding ( negative cohp ) interaction .",
    "the signs we use here are the opposite of what is used in the original definition of dronskowski and blchl @xcite .",
    "lmto - asa calculations do not allow for structural relaxation while structural relaxation process is implemented in the lapw package .",
    "we will present in what follows a comparison of the results obtained by both methods .",
    "within the lapw scheme we performed a structure optimization for licr@xmath0o@xmath1 where the cubic cell parameter @xmath15 and the oxygen position @xmath31 were varied till the optimal structure was obtained . in order to perform the optimization we considered two steps : ( i ) we first took several crystal structures with different lattice constants @xmath15 and the same @xmath31 . for each of them we performed an iteration procedure up to self - consistency and we compared the total energies .",
    "the energy minimum then defines the optimal @xmath15 .",
    "for licr@xmath0o@xmath1 the energy minimum was reached at @xmath15 = 8.11(4 )    ( see fig .  [ fig02 ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) in a second step we proceeded to optimize the oxygen positions by evaluating the atomic forces @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium oxygen position was obtained using a damped newton dynamics method according to the expression      where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the coordinate and force for the atom @xmath35 at time step @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath37 determines the speed of motion and @xmath38 changes from @xmath38 to @xmath39 if the force changes its direction from one step to the next .",
    "the optimal value we obtained for the oxygen position was @xmath31= 0.253(5 ) which implies a small distortion from the perfect spinel structure . a further unit - cell optimization did not change the result significantly .",
    "in the previous calculation scheme the unit - cell is first optimized and then the structure relaxed .",
    "since the two operations do not necessarily commute , we considered also first a structural relaxation in a bigger unit cell followed by a lattice constant optimization .",
    "the two procedures do not yield exactly the same optimal value for @xmath15 and @xmath31 , but deviations from @xmath40 and @xmath41 are small and can be considered within the error bars .",
    "we checked both in lapw and lmto that the ferromagnetic spin - polarized configuration is lower in energy than the non - spin - polarized case .",
    "we also considered within lapw an antiferromagnetic spin arrangement of the cr atoms in the spinel lattice which showed to be energetically unfavourable with respect to the ferromagnetic arrangement .",
    "figure [ fig03 ] compares the partial density of chromium @xmath8 states and oxygen @xmath28 states from spin polarized ( a ) lapw calculations and ( b ) lmto calculations . in both plots , the fermi energy is taken as the origin on the energy axis .",
    "the upper panel of each plot displays majority ( up ) spin states and the lower panel minority ( down ) spin states .",
    "cr-@xmath8 states are shown using black traces and o-@xmath28 state using grey traces .",
    "the optimized crystal structure obtained from the lapw calculations was used as the input crystal structure for the ( unrelaxed ) lmto calculations .",
    "we note immediately that in terms of gross features , the two computational methods yield quite similar results , in terms both of band positions and widths , as well as details in the structures of the projected densities of state .",
    "differences in the two plots arise only as a result of slightly larger gaps between occupied and unoccupied states between the two computational schemes ; the lapw calculations indicate larger ( by 0.5 ev ) crystal field splitting as well as larger exchange splitting ( by the same magnitude ) . this different energy shift can be understood in terms of the different nature of the two schemes and that for open structures -as the spinels are- the lmto approach is not as accurate as the lapw approach .",
    "we use here therefore the lapw results as a reference for accuracy .",
    "o @xmath28 states are found to be largely centered around -4.5 ev and possess a width of about 5 ev . there are also cr @xmath8 states in this energy region , indicative of covalency . near @xmath6",
    "we find majority cr @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) and no minority spins in the lapw dos , i.e. the polarization is 100% what characterizes the system as half - metallic . in the lmto dos there is a residual spin density of minority cr @xmath42 ( @xmath44 ) spins at @xmath45 .",
    "while strictly speaking the lmto results predict an _ approximate _ half - metal behavior , the small overall differences between both lmto and lapw approaches justifies the use of the lmto - asa calculations in some of the subsequent discussion .",
    "the @xmath46 states have a width of about 2 ev and are bimodal , with the two modes separated by a pseudo - gap .",
    "the @xmath6 lies in the center of a peak in the dos .",
    "the crystal field splitting between @xmath46 and @xmath47 is of the order of 3 ev ( taking the midpoints of the different manifolds ) and the exchange splitting between @xmath46 and @xmath48 is of the order of 2 ev .",
    "these values are in the lmto dos -as discussed above- about 0.5 ev larger .",
    "the two - peaked @xmath46 dos is puzzling .",
    "one suspect is the trigonal distortion of the oxygen octahedron around the cr atoms . in licr@xmath0o@xmath1 , the calculated oxygen position 0.253(5 )",
    "suggests a very small distortion from perfect octahedral coordination .",
    "we have performed lmto calculations using the ideal oxygen position @xmath31 = 0.250 corresponding to perfect cro@xmath18 octahedra .",
    "the differences in the dos ( between the structures where @xmath31 = 0.25 and @xmath31 = 0.253 ) are negligible and the two - peaked structure of the @xmath46 dos is retained , and @xmath6 continues to fall in the second dos peak even when o atoms are in the ideal position and the cro@xmath18 octahedra are undistorted .",
    "bimodal @xmath46 states , also observed in the electronic structure of spinel liti@xmath0o@xmath1 @xcite , could arise from the restricted b - o - b dispersion in the spinel structure ; this network can be built up from b@xmath1o@xmath1 cubes that are interconnected through b atoms .",
    "the b - o - b bond angles are therefore 90@xmath49 .",
    "this limits dispersion significantly .",
    "in fact , through the analysis of the cohp in licr@xmath0o@xmath1 in the next section we can identify that the upper lobe of the dos corresponds mainly to cr - o interactions and less to cr - cr interactions .    the most important conclusion that we draw from the dos of _",
    "licr@xmath0o@xmath1 is that states at and near @xmath6 are strongly spin - polarized and the system is indeed a magnetic half - metal .",
    "however , the fact that @xmath6 falls on a sharply peaked region of the dos suggests ( i ) that the compound might be unstable / difficult to prepare and ( ii ) if it is prepared , might be subject to electronic instabilities associated with electron correlation , i.e. the opening of a mott - hubbard gap , or charge - ordering .",
    "we suggest that various different scenarios could stabilize the structure of licr@xmath0o@xmath1 , for instance the presence of a slightly distorted antiferromagnetic structure as it is the case in znv@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "also if the system gets a little oxidized , by removing for instance some li to form li@xmath50cr@xmath0o@xmath1 , where @xmath51 , it may be then possible to have e@xmath52 sitting in the pseudogap of the dos , i.e. at the center of the bimodal dos and therefore to have a stable structure .",
    "a third possibility , as mentioned above , is the explicit consideration of the electron correlation which may open a mott - hubbard gap at e@xmath52 and therefore settle stability .",
    "it is important to compare the electronic structure of licr@xmath0o@xmath1 with the prototypic oxide half metal cro@xmath0 .",
    "present understanding of this material has been reviewed recently @xcite .",
    "this rutile compound fig .",
    "[ fig01](d ) ) has @xmath53 cr@xmath54 surrounded octahedrally by o@xmath55 .",
    "the octahedra form ribbons that share edges , and each cr can therefore be said to bond with two others through the shared edge with a cr - cr distance of 2.92    @xcite .",
    "a number of authors @xcite have described the electronic structure of this material , including korotin _",
    "@xcite who performed lda + @xmath56 calculations and argue thereof that the one - electron description of a ferromagnetic band metal does not suffice and that @xmath56 = 3.0 ev is required to explain the essential features of this compound .",
    "_ @xcite argued that when the local interaction is small compared to the bandwidth ( w ) u / w@xmath57 0.5 as in cro@xmath0 , it is disputable which method spin - polarized lda or lda+u provides a better description of the system .",
    "we have performed spin - polarized lda calculations in the lmto scheme on cro@xmath0 for two reasons .",
    "the first is that it provides us a consistent comparison with licr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "the second is that spin - polarized bonding through the use of cohps has not been presented before for this important compound .",
    "figure [ fig04 ] compares the cr @xmath8 and o @xmath28 dos of ( a ) licr@xmath0o@xmath1 and ( b ) cro@xmath0 .",
    "o @xmath28 states of cro@xmath0 are found to be quite similar to what is seen for licr@xmath0o@xmath1 , spreading from around -7 ev to -2 ev .",
    "once again , there is a strong admixture of cr @xmath8 states in this energy region .",
    "the region near the fermi energy comprised largely of cr @xmath8 states .",
    "the crystal field splitting between @xmath46 and @xmath58 is also similar in both compounds , as might be expected considering the similarity in charge and coordination .",
    "what is significantly different is the larger @xmath46 bandwidth in cro@xmath0 , as a result of the different cr - o topology in the rutile structure , that allows for easier metal - oxygen - metal hopping . unlike what we see in licr@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ", the @xmath6 in cro@xmath0 does not lay on a peak but instead , lies on the edge of a pseudo - gap in the @xmath59 states .",
    "this gap arises due to a two - in , four - out jahn - teller distortion of the cro@xmath18 octahedra @xcite .",
    "crystal orbital hamiltonian populations ( cohps ) permit a better understanding of the precise nature of the different states that would determine the properties of licr@xmath0o@xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig05 ] , we plot ( a ) cr - cr cohps and ( a ) cr - o cohps as a function of energy for licr@xmath0o@xmath1 , per primitive unit cell .",
    "this means cr interacts with six o ( at a distance of 2.00  ) and to six other cr ( at a distance of 2.86  ) .",
    "the cohps are spin resolved into interactions between orbitals with majority spin , and orbitals with minority spin . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling",
    ", majority states can not bond with minority states . in the region of the dos which was predominantly o-@xmath28 ( -7 ev to -2 ev ) we find evidence for quite strong cr - o covalency .",
    "at the @xmath6 , we find a combination of majority antibonding cr - cr interactions and majority antibonding cr - o interactions , being the cr - o interaction predominant .",
    "there are no minority interactions near the @xmath6 suggesting that the bonding is highly spin - polarized .",
    "this is what makes this compound a putative half - metal .",
    "similar cohps for cro@xmath0 [ fig .",

    ", each cr has 6 oxygen neighbors ( 4 at 1.90  and 2 at 1.91  ) , but only two cr neighbors ( at 2.92  ) .",
    "the shorter cr - o distance in cro@xmath0 , compared with licr@xmath0o@xmath1 reflects the slightly higher oxidation state of cr .",
    "the cr - o cohp suggests strong cr - o bonding in both spin directions in the region where o @xmath28 states are found .",
    "cr - cr bonding is insignificant in this structure , as a result of the larger cr - cr distance than what is found in the spinel , as well as fewer neighbors .",

    "<S> we have employed first - principles electronic structure calculations to examine the hypothetical ( but plausible ) oxide spinel , licr@xmath0o@xmath1 with the @xmath2 electronic configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the cell ( cubic ) and internal ( oxygen position ) structural parameters have been obtained for this compound through structural relaxation in the first - principles framework . within the one - electron band picture </S>",
    "<S> , we find that licr@xmath0o@xmath1 is magnetic , and a candidate half - metal . </S>",
    "<S> the electronic structure is substantially different from the closely related and well known rutile half - metal cro@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find a smaller conduction band width in the spinel compound , perhaps as a result of the distinct topology of the spinel crystal structure , and the reduced oxidation state . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetism and half - metallicity of licr@xmath0o@xmath1 has been mapped in the parameter space of its cubic crystal structure . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons with superconducting liti@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath3 ) , heavy - fermion liv@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath4 ) and charge - ordering limn@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath5 ) suggest the effectiveness of a nearly - rigid band picture involving simple shifts of the position of @xmath6 in these very different materials . </S>",
    "<S> comparisons are also made with the electronic structure of znv@xmath0o@xmath1 ( @xmath7 ) , a correlated insulator that undergoes a structural and antiferromagnetic phase transition . </S>"
