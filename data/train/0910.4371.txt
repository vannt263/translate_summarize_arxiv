    "<S> we consider the following questions .    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath3 the subdivision map of a finite subdivision rule ? 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath3 the subdivision map of a finite subdivision rule with two tile types and 1-skeleton of the subdivision complex a circle ? 3 .   </S>",
    "<S> is @xmath3 the subdivision map of a finite subdivision rule with one tile type ?    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we consider these questions for latts maps . </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this paper is to answer question 3 in the affirmative for the maps in all but finitely many analytic conjugacy classes of latts maps . </S>",
    "<S> in addition we exhibit a latts map of degree 2 for which the answer to questions 2 and 3 is negative , although the answer to question 1 is positive .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper has four sections . </S>",
    "<S> the first section develops the setting of latts maps . </S>",
    "<S> these results can be used to easily enumerate all latts maps of very small degree to test ( not so easy ) the above three questions for them .    </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec : prune ] presents the pruning lemma and immediate consequences . to describe the pruning lemma , </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath3 be a latt@xmath4 map which is the subdivision map of a finite subdivision rule with one tile type . </S>",
    "<S> this obtains a subdivision complex structure on the riemann sphere whose 1-skeleton is a tree . </S>",
    "<S> the postcritical points of @xmath3 are vertices of this tree . </S>",
    "<S> the pruning lemma states that it is possible to prune this tree to obtain a subtree for which every vertex with valence either 1 or 2 is a postcritical point and this subtree is the 1-skeleton of a subdivision complex for which @xmath3 is the subdivision map . </S>",
    "<S> so if @xmath3 is the subdivision map for a subdivision complex whose 1-skeleton is a tree , then @xmath3 is the subdivision map for a subdivision complex whose 1-skeleton is a tree with a special form . </S>",
    "<S> this special form is very restrictive .    </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec : largedeg ] contains the main result in corollary  [ cor : main ] , namely , that every map in almost every analytic conjugacy class of latts maps is the subdivision map of a finite subdivision rule with one tile type . </S>",
    "<S> this is essentially proved in two theorems . </S>",
    "<S> the first theorem , theorem  [ thm : onetilea ] , states that every latts map with sufficiently large degree is the subdivision map of a finite subdivision rule with one tile type . </S>",
    "<S> the second theorem , theorem  [ thm : onetileb ] , states that every nonrigid latts map is the subdivision map of a finite subdivision rule with one tile type . since there are only finitely many analytic conjugacy classes of rigid latts maps with a given degree ( see the end of section  [ sec : defn ] . </S>",
    "<S> ) , these two theorems give the main result . </S>",
    "<S> theorems  [ thm : onetilea ] and [ thm : onetileb ] actually say a bit more , giving additional information about the tilings .    </S>",
    "<S> the proof of theorem  [ thm : onetilea ] is much more difficult than the proof of theorem  [ thm : onetileb ] . </S>",
    "<S> it roughly parallels the proof of the main theorem of @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the strategy is to construct a finite subdivision rule @xmath0 with one tile type , bounded valence , and mesh approaching 0 combinatorially such that the subdivision map @xmath2 of @xmath0 is isotopic to the latts map @xmath3 relative to its postcritical set @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> once this is achieved , our results for expansion complexes @xcite can be used to show that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are in fact conjugate rel @xmath5 , and so @xmath3 is the subdivision map of a finite subdivision rule with one tile type . </S>",
    "<S> the finite subdivision rule @xmath0 is constructed using a lift of @xmath3 to the complex plane and a standard tiling of the plane by regular hexagons . </S>",
    "<S> our tiling of the riemann sphere by one tile lifts to a tiling of the plane which is combinatorially equivalent to this standard tiling by regular hexagons . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of theorem  [ thm : onetileb ] does not require an isotopy and hence does not require results for expansion complexes . </S>",
    "<S> in this case our tiling of the riemann sphere by one tile lifts to a standard tiling of the plane by parallelograms .    </S>",
    "<S> section  [ sec : badquadratic ] presents an example which shows that the main result does not hold for every latts map . </S>",
    "<S> this example is a quadratic latts map @xmath3 for which both question 2 and question 3 are false . </S>",
    "<S> question 1 is true for @xmath3 , as we show that @xmath3 is the subdivision map of a finite subdivision rule with two tile types , but the 1-skeleton of the subdivision complex is not a circle . </S>",
    "<S> the latts map @xmath3 has a lift to the complex plane of the form @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and the postcritical set of @xmath3 lifts to the lattice generated by 1 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the complex conjugate of @xmath3 gives another such example . </S>",
    "<S> yet another example with these properties is given by a real cubic latts map @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the map @xmath9 has a lift to the complex plane of the form @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and the postcritical set of @xmath9 lifts to the lattice generated by 1 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to prove these claims for @xmath9 much as we prove them for @xmath3 in section  [ sec : badquadratic ] . </S>",
    "<S> the three analytic conjugacy classes of latts maps represented by these three maps are probably the only ones for which question 3 is false .    as for question 1 , </S>",
    "<S> as far as we know , every rational map with finite postcritical set and no periodic critical points is the subdivision map of a finite subdivision rule . </S>"
