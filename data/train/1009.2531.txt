    "the disk scale height factors for these sources , however , are found to vary significantly .",
    "evidence for dust settling effects among the upper scorpius primordial disk sample remains inconclusive at best .",
    "the clearly different near- and mid - infrared color excess distributions of the upper scorpius and taurus - auriga class ii populations found by dahm & carpenter ( 2009 ) suggest that the upper scorpius stars have experienced some degree of inner disk evolution relative to their presumably younger counterparts in taurus - auriga .",

    "this could in part result from the limited number of models examined for each source , which do not sample the full range of available parameter space of disk structure .",
    "another limitation of the robitaille et al .",
    "( 2006 ) models is the assumption that disk gaps are completely devoid of dust , a reduction in complexity that impacts the predicted near- and mid - infrared excess distributions , critical for constraining disk emission originating from the inner disk rim .    in summary 3 of 9 late - type , disk - bearing stars in the upper scorpius sample exhibit seds that are most consistent with having inner disk radii that lie beyond the sublimation radius for silicate dust : [ pz99]j161411.0 - 230536 , j160900.7 - 190852 , and scopms31 .",

    "( 2007 ) models of the upper scorpius sample ( i.e. concurrent decreased values of the disk flaring parameter and disk scale height factor ) are inconclusive , leaving open to question the nature of the remaining upper scorpius primordial disks and their evolutionary state .",
    "transition disks are believed to represent an early stage of disk clearing and may be in the process of rapid grain growth , planetesimal and planet formation . adopting the disk classification scheme of luhman et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , many upper scorpius sources would be classified as pre - transitional objects , i.e. disks that exhibit reduced emission at wavelengths @xmath910 @xmath0 m , but that still retain significant disk emission at longer wavelengths .",
    "two of the upper scorpius pre - transitional candidates appear to exhibit gapped disk structure : j160900.7 - 190852 and scopms31 .",

    "at least one upper scorpius source , j160643.8 - 190805 , exhibits an infrared sed that is suggestive of an homologously depleted disk system as defined by currie et al .",
    "( 2009 ) .    before attributing the reduced levels of infrared excess emission in the upper scorpius sample to disk evolutionary processes , binarity must be considered as an explanation for the cleared out inner cavities ( e.g. coku tau 4 , ireland & kraus 2008 ) .",
    "two of the disk candidates included in this analysis , [ pz99]j161411.1 - 230536 and scopms 31 , are established binaries resolved by high angular resolution imaging .",
    "it must also be acknowledged that the spex sample represents only @xmath125% of all primordial disk - bearing stars expected among the @xmath1250 known late - type members of the upper scorpius ob association .",
    "observations of more late - type , disk - bearing systems are critically needed to confirm the results presented here .    improved modeling of the upper scorpius primordial disk - bearing sample",
    "is clearly needed to provide better constraints for the inner disk structure of these presumably evolved primordial disk systems .",
    "monte carlo three - dimensional , radiative transfer codes are now available that could be applied to the seds of these sources .",
    "high angular resolution imaging is also needed to identify close ( @xmath910 au ) binary companions that may account for the reduced near- and mid - infrared excess emission of these sources relative to class ii sources in taurus - auriga .",
