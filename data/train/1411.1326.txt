    "<S> ferroelectrics are attractive candidate materials for environmentally friendly solid state refrigeration free of greenhouse gases . </S>",
    "<S> their thermal response upon variations of external electric fields is largest in the vicinity of their phase transitions , which may occur near room temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the effect , however , is too small for useful cooling applications even when they are driven close to dielectric breakdown . </S>",
    "<S> insight from microscopic theory is therefore needed to characterize materials and provide guiding principles to search for new ones with enhanced electrocaloric performance . here </S>",
    "<S> , we derive from well - known microscopic models of ferroelectricity meaningful figures of merit for a wide class of ferroelectric materials . such figures of merit provide insight into the relation between the strength of the effect and the characteristic interactions of ferroelectrics such as dipolar forces . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the long range nature of these interactions results in a small effect . </S>",
    "<S> a strategy is proposed to make it larger by shortening the correlation lengths of fluctuations of polarization . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we bring into question other widely used but empirical figures of merit and facilitate understanding of the recently observed secondary broad peak in the electrocalorics of relaxor ferroelectrics .    </S>",
    "<S> the thermal changes that occur in ferroelectric  ( fe ) materials upon the application or removal of electric fields are known as the electrocaloric effect  ( ece ) .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the effect was first studied in rochelle salt in 1930  @xcite and it s the electric analogue of the magnetocaloric effect , which is commonly used to reach temperatures in the millikelvin range . the ece is the result of entropy variations with polarization , e.g. , isothermal polarization of a ferroelectric reduces its entropy while depolarization increases it . </S>",
    "<S> it is parametrized by isothermal changes in entropy @xmath0 and adiabatic changes in temperature @xmath1 and it is strongest near the ferroelectric transition .    </S>",
    "<S> since the phase transitions occur near room temperature in many fes , the potential for using the ece for cooling applications is huge : it could provide an alternative to standard refrigeration technologies based on the vapor - compression method in which the running substances are greenhouse gases such as freon and hydrochlorofluorocarbons ;  @xcite replace the widely used but inefficient small thermoelectric cooling devices such as peltier coolers ;  @xcite and lead to energy harvesting applications .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite moreover , developing cooling prototypes based on the ece  @xcite may have several advantages over those based on the more studied magnetocaloric effect as the magnetic materials of interest require expensive rare - earth elements and large magnetic fields , while many fes are ceramics or polymers , which are cheap and can be driven with electric fields that are easy to generate .    </S>",
    "<S> though promising , a major challenge is that the magnitude of the ece remains too small for useful applications : in bulk fes , @xmath2 is usually less than a few millikelvin per volt and @xmath0 is usually a fraction of a jk@xmath3mol@xmath3 .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite fe thin films exhibit eces of about an order of magnitude larger than their bulk counterparts as they can withstand larger breakdown electric fields .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite thin films , however , have small cooling power because of their small heat capacities . </S>",
    "<S> ferroelectric polymers have also received considerable attention with eces comparable to those of thin films , though they must be driven at larger electric fields than those of thin films .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in the light of these challenges , it has been recently pointed out that insight from microscopic theory into the ece may contribute to characterize known materials and provide guiding principles to search for new ones with enhanced electrocaloric performance .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite here , we provide such insight by deriving meaningful figures of merit from well - known microscopic models of ferroelectricity . </S>",
    "<S> our figure of merit allow us to set trends across different classes of fe materials ( order - disorder and displacive ) and provides insight into the relation between the magnitude of the ece and the characteristic interactions of fes ( e.g. dipolar and strain ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the long - range nature of these interactions produces trade - offs in the ece : while they can give rise to high transition temperatures ( i.e. , comparable to room temperature ) , they concomitantly give rise to long correlation lengths of polarization at finite electric fields , which , as we show here , result in a small effect . </S>",
    "<S> we make contact with well - known results derived from landau theory  @xcite and those from heuristic arguments .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite based on these findings , we then study the effects of compositional disorder . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of this is twofold : to propose a strategy to increase the magnitude of the ece and to model the ece of so - called relaxor ferroelectrics - a widely studied class of electrocaloric materials with diffuse phase transitions that could provide a broad temperature range of operation in a cooling device .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we find that the commonly observed secondary broad peak in the ece of relaxors  @xcite is expected in any ferroelectric that is deep in the supercritical region of their phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> our results also bring into question the common practice of defining the electrocaloric strength of a material as the ratio of the entropy or temperature changes over the change in applied electric field .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    to illustrate the ideas presented above , we adhere to a simple microscopic model for displacive ferroelectrics with quenched random electric fields .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite such compositional disorder is typical of relaxor ferroelectrics such as the prototype pbmg@xmath4nb@xmath5o@xmath6  ( pmn ) and it arises from the different charge valencies and disordered location of the mg@xmath7 and nb@xmath8 ions . in the absence of disorder , it is a standard minimal model of ferroelectricity .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with disorder , the model gives a good starting point for the description of the static dielectric properties of relaxors .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in calculating the ece in the presence of compositional disorder , it is important to recall that maxwell relations are not applicable . </S>",
    "<S> maxwell relations are usually invoked in ferroelectrics to indirectly determine , for instance , adiabatic changes in temperature @xmath1 from the variations of the polarization with respect to temperature .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite pure ferroelectrics are in thermodynamic equilibrium , thus maxwell relations hold . </S>",
    "<S> disordered ferroelectrics are not in thermodynamic equilibrium , thus maxwell s relations do not apply . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by the recent experimental observation that direct measurements of @xmath1 in solutions of the relaxor ferroelectric polymer pvdf - trfe - cfe with pvdf - ctfe were significantly larger than those estimated from their polarization curves .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite another difficulty is that landau theory fails for relaxors . </S>",
    "<S> landau theory is applicable away from the region of critical fluctuations of polarization that occur near the transition point . in conventional ferroelectrics , </S>",
    "<S> landau theory works remarkably well since this region is narrow .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in relaxors , on the other hand , landau theory is not expected to hold as the region of fluctuations is broad . </S>",

    "<S> as the electric field changes increase , a broad peak develops in addition to the usual sharp one at @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> such broad peak in @xmath1 is commonly observed in relaxors and it is usually attributed to nanoscaled polar domains .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite however , our model predicts a broad peak occurs in @xmath1 already in the absence of compositional disorder ( where there are no polar nanodomains ) for very strong fields . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the broad peak is simply the expected maximum in the ece for a ferroelectric that is deep in the supercritical regime , i.e. , away from the critical point  ( @xmath62 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain similar results from landau theory . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite experimentally , this broad peak is not observed in conventional ferroelectrics as their breakdown fields are close to their critical fields , e.g. , @xmath63kv / cm  @xcite and @xmath64kv / cm  @xcite for batio@xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> starting from well - known microscopic models of ferroelectricity , we have derived a meaningful figure of merit for the ece in a wide class of fe materials . when defining a figure of merit for a caloric effect </S>",
    "<S> , we find crucial to account for the well - known non - linearities that occur near the fe transition . </S>",
    "<S> the large correlation lengths of fluctuations of polarization of fes , result in a small ece . </S>",
    "<S> we predict that ultraweak fes such as those of the tscc - family should exhibit figures of merit of about an order of magnitude larger than those of conventional displacive and order - disorder fes . shortening the correlation lengths results in larger isothermal changes in entropy , lower transition temperatures , and smaller adiabatic changes in temperature . </S>",
    "<S> broad peaks in the ece such as those that have been observed in relaxors are expected for any ferroelectric that can go well into the supercritical region . </S>",
    "<S> our work has implications beyond the ece as a similar analysis could be performed for other caloric effects such as magneto- and mechano - caloric effects , which are currently being studied extensively .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite our results in combination with other recently proposed figures of merit  @xcite should provide guidance for characterizing known caloric materials and designing new ones with enhanced performance .    </S>",
