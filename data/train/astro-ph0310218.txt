    "the discovery of the very first extrasolar planet orbiting a main - sequence star , 51  peg  b , brought the surprising revelation that other planetary worlds can revolve around their host stars in extraordinarily tight orbits ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) . around approximately one per cent of all the stars targeted by radial - velocity searches , similar planets are found with periods of a few days .",
    "these short - period planets were probably formed within a protostellar disk several au away from their host stars through a sequence of physical processes outlined in the conventional ` core - accretion ' theories of planetary formation ( lissauer 1993 ; pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) . during its final accretion phase , strong interactions between a protoplanet and its natal disk lead to the formation of a gap near its orbit , which effectively terminates its growth .",
    "angular momentum exchange with the disk causes a protoplanet formed in the inner region of the disk to migrate towards its host star ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; lin & papaloizou 1986 ) . near the star , the protoplanet s migration may be halted either by its tidal interaction with a rapidly spinning host star or by entering a cavity in the disk associated with the stellar magnetosphere ( lin , bodenheimer , & richardson 1996 ) .",
    "planets may also terminate their migration with intermediate - period orbits when their natal disks are rapidly depleted ( trilling , lunine , & benz 2002 ; armitage et al .",
    "2002 ; ida & lin 2003 ) .",
    "short - period planets may be scattered to the vicinity of ( or far away from ) the stellar surface owing to dynamical instabilities associated with their long - term post - formation gravitational interaction ( rasio & ford 1996 ; weidenschilling & marzari 1996 ) . in this case",
    ", the protoplanet s orbit may initially be highly eccentric and subsequently undergo circularization owing to the tidal dissipation within its envelope ( rasio et al .",
    "scattering by residual planetesimals is another promising avenue for planetary orbital migration ( murray et al .",
    "it has also been suggested that short - period planets may be formed _ in situ _ through a sequence of planetesimal migration , coagulation , and gas accretion ( papaloizou & terquem 1999 ; bodenheimer , hubickyj , & lissauer 2000 ; sasselov & lecar 2000 ) .",
    "finally , a totally different theory of protoplanetary formation relies upon gravitational instability in a massive gaseous protostellar disk ( kuiper 1951 ; cameron 1978 ; boss 1997 ) , which produces a subcondensation with a composition close to that of the central star and having little , if any , solid core .",
    "although the inferred presence of solid cores in jupiter , saturn , uranus , and neptune ( hubbard 1984 ) favors the orderly growth scenario in our solar system , there is as yet no direct evidence for or against the existence of cores in extrasolar planets .    in the past eight years",
    ", more than 100 planets have been discovered , around approximately ten per cent of the target stars in various planet search programs .",
    "a comprehensive distribution of planetary mass , period , and eccentricity has begun to emerge .",
    "these data are particularly useful for constraining and differentiating some scenarios for the formation and evolution of short - period planets .",
    "for example , there appears to be a minimum cut - off period at about three days . if the short periods of some planets were attained through orbital migration , their observed period distribution could be attributable to the stopping mechanism involved .",
    "it is also possible that the present period distribution is established through post - formation evolution , e.g. , planets with extremely short periods may have perished subsequent to their formation .",
    "a particularly interesting characteristic of the planet - bearing stars is that they tend to be metal - rich with respect to the sun and the f ",
    "g field - star average in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , gonzalez et al .",
    "2001 ; santos , israelian , & mayor 2001 ) .",
    "this correlation may result from planets having being consumed following either migration through the protoplanetary disk ( lin 1997 ; laughlin & adams 1997 ; sandquist et al .",
    "1998 ) or gravitational interaction with other planets ( rasio & ford 1996 ) .",
    "it may also be interpreted as evidence that an enhanced metallicity in the planet - forming disk , probably resulting from a metal - rich parent cloud , is especially conducive to planet formation ( pollack et al .",
    "1996 ; fischer & valenti 2003 ; ida & lin 2003 ) .    another important set of observational data is the planets eccentricities . while the eccentricities of planets with periods @xmath1 days are uniformly distributed up to about @xmath2 , all planets with @xmath3 days have nearly circular orbits .",
    "this observed dichotomy in the eccentricity  period distribution has been attributed to the circularization of the orbits of short - period planets induced by their internal tidal dissipation ( rasio et al .",
    "1996 ; marcy et al .",
    "such a scenario would be necessary to account for the small eccentricities of the short - period planets if they were scattered into , or strongly perturbed in , the vicinity of their host stars by their planetary siblings . if , instead , the short - period planets acquired their small semi - major axes through tidal interaction with their natal disks ( lin et al .",
    "1996 ) , such a process may be able to damp the eccentricities of planets with masses @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the mass of jupiter ) ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 ; artymowicz 1992 ) , although this hypothesis remains uncertain ( papaloizou , nelson , & masset 2001 ; goldreich & sari 2003 ) . however , some of the potential stopping mechanisms , such as the planets tidal interaction with rapidly spinning host stars ( lin et al .",
    "1996 ) , can also excite their orbital eccentricities ( dobbs - dixon , lin , & mardling 2003 ) .",
    "an efficient post - formation eccentricity damping mechanism may still be needed to account for the small eccentricities of the short - period planets .",
    "although no information is available on the rotation of extrasolar planets , tidal interaction with the host star is expected to bring the rotation of a short - period planet into synchronism with its orbit and to eliminate any obliquity of its rotation axis .",
    "since the spin of a planet accounts for much less angular momentum than its orbit , synchronization proceeds more rapidly than circularization .",
    "this assumption neglects the possible effects of thermal tides , which may tend to drive the planet away from synchronism ( thomson 1882 ; gold & soter 1969 ) .",
    "tidal interaction can also modify the radii and internal structures of short - period planets . in principle , the actual sizes of extrasolar planets may be used , at least as a partial test , to infer whether they formed through core accretion or through gravitational instability of massive gaseous protostellar disks . in the fully convective envelopes of gaseous giant planets , it is difficult for the refractory elements to condense into droplets and become differentiated from the volatile elements ( cf .",
    "guillot et al .",
    "therefore planets formed through orderly core accretion are more likely to have solid cores and to be relatively compact , whereas those formed through gravitational instability are likely to retain a nearly uniform solar composition throughout their interiors and to be more extended .",
    "the detection of a transiting planet around the star hd  209458 provides an opportunity for us to measure its radius directly and thereby to constrain its present internal structure . the observed radius , @xmath6 , of this @xmath7 planet ( brown et al .",
    "2001 ) is larger than that expected for a coreless planet with a similar mass and age .",
    "a planet with a core would be still more compact , leading to an even larger discrepancy with the observational measurement .",
    "for this short - period planet , the presence of a small residual orbital eccentricity or non - synchronous rotation could lead to internal tidal dissipation with a heating rate comparable to or larger than that released by the kelvin ",
    "helmholtz contraction .",
    "provided that the dissipation of the host star s tidal disturbance occurs well below the planet s photosphere , it increases the planet s internal temperature and equilibrium radius ( bodenheimer et al . 2000 ) .",
    "star interactions may also have altered the mass distribution of the short - period planets . above a critical eccentricity , which is a function of the planet s semi - major axis , tidal dissipation of energy during the circularization process",
    "can cause a planet to inflate in size before its eccentricity is damped . for moderate eccentricities",
    ", the planet adjusts through a sequence of stable thermal equilibria in which the rate of internal tidal dissipation is balanced by the enhanced radiative flux associated with the planet s enlarged radius . for sufficiently large eccentricities ,",
    "the planet swells beyond @xmath8 and its internal degeneracy is partially lifted .",
    "thereafter , the thermal equilibria become unstable and the planet undergoes runaway inflation until its radius exceeds the roche radius ( gu , lin , & bodenheimer 2003 ) .",
    "the critical eccentricity of about 0.2 ( for a young jupiter - mass planet with a period less than three days ) may be easily attained , with the result that many short - period planets may have migrated to the vicinity of their host stars and perished there .",
    "the above discussion clearly indicates the importance of planet  star tidal interactions to the origin and destiny of short - period planets",
    ". they may determine ( 1 ) the asymptotic semi - major axis of migrating protoplanets , ( 2 ) the absence of planets with periods less than three days , ( 3 ) the structure of those planets that survive in the vicinity of their host stars , and ( 4 ) the small eccentricities and relatively low masses of the short - period planets .",
    "however , the efficiency of these processes depends crucially on the ability of the planet to dissipate tidal disturbances , which is poorly understood .",
    "an early analysis of the nature of the tidal interaction between earth and the moon was introduced by darwin ( 1880 ) based on the concept of the equilibrium tide ( see cartwright 2000 for a historical discussion ) . in this model , due originally to newton",
    ", a homogeneous spherical body continually adjusts to maintain a state of quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium in the varying gravitational potential of its orbital companion .",
    "darwin introduced a phase lag into the response , the lag being proportional to the tidal forcing frequency and attributable to the viscosity of the body .",
    "the phase lag gives rise to a net tidal torque and dissipation of energy .",
    "subsequent formulations ( munk & macdonald 1960 ; goldreich & soter 1966 ) parametrize the efficiency of the tidal dissipation , whatever its origin , by a specific dissipation function or @xmath0-value ( quality factor ) .",
    "although , in principle , @xmath0 is an unknown function of the frequency and amplitude of the tidal forcing , in the planetary science community it is usually treated as a constant property of each body in the solar system , corresponding to a constant phase lag of @xmath9 ( e.g. , murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "indeed , studies of the earth s rotation provide evidence that its @xmath0-value is approximately constant over a wide range of frequency ( munk & macdonald 1960 ) , even though a variety of mechanisms may be responsible .",
    "the tidal @xmath0-value may be predominantly determined by turbulent dissipation in the shallow seas ( taylor 1920 ; jeffreys 1920 ; see munk & macdonald 1960 for a discussion ) . in the case of the moon ,",
    "the observational constraints on @xmath0 are much weaker , but the synchronized spin of the moon suggests that the presence of an ocean is not necessary for tidal dissipation . in the context of binary stars , the assumption of a constant lag time is usually adopted ( hut 1981 ; eggleton , kiseleva , & hut 1998 ) as in darwin s viscous model .",
    "evidence of tidal dissipation can also be found in gaseous giant planets such as jupiter and saturn .",
    "for example , the laplace resonance of io , europa , and ganymede may be entered through the tidal interaction of the moons with jupiter ( goldreich 1965 ; peale , cassen , & reynolds 1979 ; lin & papaloizou 1979b ) . in order to maintain this resonant configuration despite the dissipation inside io , tidal dissipation within jupiter",
    "must continually induce angular momentum transfer from its spin to io s orbit .",
    "the magnitude of the @xmath0-value for jupiter , inferred from io s dissipation rate , is in the range @xmath10 ( yoder & peale 1981 ) .",
    "these values are similar to those inferred , for solar - type stars , from the circularization of close binaries as a function of their age and semi - major axis ( mathieu 1994 ; terquem et al .",
    "1998 ) . using these values of @xmath0 , the orbital evolution of a planetary or a stellar companion of a main - sequence star can be estimated by extrapolation , under the assumption of either a constant lag angle ( goldreich & soter 1966 ) , a constant lag time ( hut 1981 ; eggleton et al .",
    "1998 ) , or an intermediate approach ( mardling & lin 2002 ) .    in the extended convective envelopes of gaseous giant planets and low - mass stars",
    ", turbulence can lead to dissipation of the motion that results from the continual adjustment of the equilibrium tide .",
    "however , the turbulent viscosity estimated from the mixing - length theory ought to be reduced by a frequency - dependent factor owing to the fact that the convective turnover timescale is usually much longer than the period of the tidal forcing . estimating this reduction in the efficiency of the turbulent viscosity , zahn ( 1977 , 1989 ) analyzed the dissipation of equilibrium tides in low - mass stars and computed an efficiency of angular momentum transfer for a non - rotating star that matches the observationally inferred circularization timescale of solar - type binary stars ( mathieu 1994 ) .",
    "however , with a different prescription for the efficiency reduction factor ( goldreich & keeley 1977 ; goodman & oh 1997 ) , the derived rate of angular momentum transfer falls short of that required by nearly two orders of magnitude ( terquem et al .",
    "1998 ) . based on a similar approach , which gives @xmath11 from the dissipation of the equilibrium tide in jupiter ,",
    "goldreich & nicholson ( 1977 ) suggested that the tidal interaction between the galilean satellites and jupiter can not drive any significant orbital evolution .",
    "for the short - period extrasolar planets , such a high @xmath0-value would imply circularization times considerably longer than the ages of their host stars .",
    "the problem of tidal dissipation is even more acute for high - mass stars in close binaries because they have extended radiative envelopes that may be expected to be free from turbulence .",
    "yet their orbits are indeed circularized despite their short lifespans ( primini , rappaport , & joss 1977 ) . in these systems ,",
    "the tidal perturbation of the companion can induce the resonant excitation of low - frequency g - mode oscillations in the radiative region , which carry both energy and angular momentum fluxes ( cowling 1941 ; zahn 1970 ) .",
    "this wavelike , dynamical tide exists in addition to the equilibrium tide and provides an alternative avenue for tidal dissipation .",
    "the g  modes are primarily excited in the radiative envelope close to the convective core where the brunt  visl frequency is comparable to the tidal forcing frequency and the wavelengths of the gravity waves are sufficiently long to couple well with the tidal potential ( goldreich & nicholson 1989 ) . using asymptotic methods in the limit that the forcing frequency is small compared to the dynamical frequency of the star , zahn demonstrated the existence of resonant modes that amplify the dynamical response of the star at particular frequencies .",
    "this local analysis was generalized to modest frequencies in a numerical analysis by savonije & papaloizou ( 1983 , 1984 ) . despite the absence of convectively driven turbulence in the radiative envelope",
    ", the g - mode oscillations can be dissipated through radiative damping on the wavelength scale .",
    "the radiative loss in the stellar interior is generally weak so that the waves can propagate in an approximately adiabatic manner to the stellar surface where they are dissipated and the angular momentum they carry is deposited .",
    "this concept gives rise to the interesting suggestion that the stars become synchronized from the outside in ( goldreich & nicholson 1989 ) .",
    "as the dissipation layer first establishes a synchronized rotation , it presents a barrier to the outwardly propagating waves in the form of a corotation resonance at which the group velocity of the waves vanishes . just below the corotation resonance ,",
    "waves are stalled with large amplitude and dissipated .",
    "this process continues , initially inducing differential rotation but eventually leading to the global synchronization of the stellar spin .",
    "this theoretical model is in agreement with the observed spin and orbital evolution of high - mass close binary stars ( giuricin , mardirossian , & mezzetti 1984a , 1984b ) .    in the interior of a solar - type star , where a radiative core is surrounded by a convective envelope , g - mode oscillations",
    "are also excited in the radiative region and , inasmuch as they extend into the outer convective region , they are dissipated by turbulent viscosity . for some special forcing frequencies ,",
    "these g - mode oscillations can also attain a global resonance that strongly enhances the oscillation amplitude in the radiative region and the rate of dissipation in the convective region ( terquem et al .",
    "nevertheless , the overall synchronization process is limited by the less efficient tidal dissipation that occurs in between resonant frequencies .",
    "a calibration with the observed circularization periods suggests that the required viscosity is nearly two orders of magnitude larger than that inferred from the standard mixing - length model for turbulent convection and the goldreich & keeley ( 1977 ) reduction factor .",
    "although g - mode excitation is a powerful process that drives the dynamical tidal response in stars , it can be effective only in radiative regions .",
    "since the envelopes of gaseous giant planets are mostly convective , the relevance of g - mode oscillations is less well established . in a series of papers , ioannou & lindzen ( 1993a , 1993b , 1994 ) considered the dynamical response of jupiter to the tidal perturbation of io with a prescribed model for jupiter s interior .",
    "they showed that g  modes can be resonantly excited if the interior is slightly subadiabatic to the extent that an appropriately tuned wave cavity is created .",
    "when these waves are transmitted into the atmosphere and dissipated , they can produce an effective @xmath0-value comparable to that inferred from the supposed orbital evolution of io . however , current models suggest that convection may extend throughout the entire envelope of jupiter and is such an efficient heat - transport process that jupiter s envelope is adiabatically stratified and neutrally buoyant to a very high degree ( guillot et al .",
    "2003 ) . in this limit ,",
    "ioannou & lindzen s mechanism does not work and only a non - wavelike dynamical response to io s tidal perturbation would remain with a much reduced amplitude and @xmath12 .",
    "in contrast to jupiter , the surface layers of short - period extrasolar planets may be stabilized against convection because they are intensely heated by their host stars and may attain a radiative state .",
    "if so , g - mode oscillations may be excited in the radiative layer just above its interface with the planet s convective envelope and dissipated through radiative or nonlinear damping ( lubow , tout , & livio 1997 ) as suggested for high - mass stars .",
    "however , the one - sided stellar irradiation of the surface of a synchronized planet induces a large - scale , shallow circulation ( burkert et al . 2003 ) , which does not necessarily suppress convection and enhance the brunt - visl frequency over an extended region in the atmosphere .",
    "thus the efficiency of dynamical tidal dissipation via g - mode oscillations remains an outstanding issue .    in their calculation",
    "ioannou & lindzen ( 1993a , 1993b ) also considered the effects of uniform rotation .",
    "for the excitation of the dynamical response , they adopted the so - called ` traditional approximation ' in which only the radial component of the angular velocity is included in the computation of the coriolis force ( eckart 1960 ; chapman & lindzen 1970 ; unno et al . 1989 ) .",
    "this approach was justified in their model on the basis that the dynamical response occurs primarily near the atmosphere of jupiter where the horizontal scale of the motion is large and the radial velocity perturbation is relatively small .",
    "it enabled them to separate the radial and angular variables in the governing linearized equations for the perturbations .",
    "the meridional structure of jupiter s response due to io s perturbation is then determined by laplace s tidal equation , the solutions of which are hough modes ( hough 1897 , 1898 ) instead of spherical harmonics , while the radial structure is determined by a set of ordinary differential equations . using a local ( wkb ) approximation",
    ", they obtained a dispersion relation describing a mixture of gravity , inertial , and acoustic oscillations .",
    "although inertial waves can be excited in the nearly adiabatic planetary interior , ioannou & lindzen ( 1993b ) did not consider them relevant for tidal dissipation .",
    "in fact the main effect of rotation in their model is that tidal forcing by a single solid harmonic projects on to many hough modes , each with the potential to resonate .",
    "they noted that the traditional approximation of neglecting the latitudinal component of the angular velocity is , in fact , not appropriate in the planet s interior .",
    "the effects of uniform rotation have been investigated in greater depth by savonije , papaloizou , & alberts ( 1995 ) in the context of high - mass binary stars , which consist of extended radiative envelopes around small convective cores .",
    "these authors were the first to attempt a two - dimensional numerical solution of the linearized equations governing tidal disturbances , including the full coriolis force . by ` switching off ' terms deriving from the non - radial component of the angular velocity , they were able to verify that the traditional approximation can give a reasonably accurate measure of the tidal torque on a highly stratified , slowly rotating star .",
    "like ioannou & lindzen ( 1993b ) , they found that the possibilities for resonant excitation of g  modes are enhanced in a rotating star because the coriolis force couples spherical harmonics of different degrees .",
    "recently savonije & witte ( 2002 ) applied the traditional approximation to carry out a high - resolution study of the dynamical tidal interaction between a uniformly rotating solar - type star and an orbital companion including the effects of stellar evolution .    at the same time , savonije et al .",
    "( 1995 ) noted that the coriolis force introduces a rich spectrum of inertial modes in a certain frequency range , which are not adequately represented by the traditional approximation .",
    "when the full coriolis force is included , the response of the star to tidal forcing in the frequency range of the inertial modes contains large - amplitude , very short - wavelength components that could not be resolved on the grid . using an improved finite - difference numerical scheme including viscosity ( savonije & papaloizou 1997 ) and an asymptotic perturbation analysis ( papaloizou & savonije 1997 ) , they later showed that inertial modes can be resonantly excited in the adiabatic convective cores of high - mass stars and",
    "can interact with the rotationally modified g  modes and torsional r  modes in the radiative envelopes .",
    "when these waves are dissipated through radiative damping , the efficiency of the tidal interaction is greatly enhanced .",
    "the study of inertial waves is said to have originated with poincar ( see greenspan 1968 ) .",
    "much attention has been devoted to the oscillations of an incompressible fluid contained in a rotating spherical , spheroidal , or cylindrical container .",
    "when the ekman number is small , the coriolis force provides the only significant restoring force , away from viscous boundary layers , and the resulting inertial waves have remarkable mathematical and physical properties .",
    "the low - frequency oscillations of an adiabatically stratified star or planet in uniform rotation are governed by a very similar problem ( papaloizou & pringle 1981 , 1982 ) . in each case",
    "the inertial waves have frequencies ( as observed in the rotating frame ) no greater in magnitude than twice the angular velocity of the fluid , and have a rich spectrum that is dense or continuous in the absence of viscosity .    in the simplest problems , such as that of a full sphere of incompressible fluid , an apparently complete set of inviscid inertial wave solutions",
    "can be obtained analytically ( greenspan 1968 ; zhang et al .",
    "however , the calculation of inertial waves in a spherical annulus , or in a star or planet with an arbitrary density stratification , requires two - dimensional numerical computations .",
    "moreover , since the inviscid poincar equation is spatially hyperbolic in the relevant range of frequencies , the problem is ill - posed unless an explicit viscosity is included .",
    "rieutord & valdettaro ( 1997 ) calculated inertial waves in a spherical annulus , noting the behavior of the frequencies , damping rates , and eigenfunctions in the limit of small ekman number .",
    "their results were further elucidated by rieutord , georgeot , & valdettaro ( 2001 ) , who explained the important influence of the solid core . in particular ,",
    "the viscous eigenfunctions are concentrated on characteristic rays of the poincar equation , which typically converge towards limit cycles as they reflect repeatedly from the inner and outer boundaries . a balance between the focusing of the wave energy along the converging rays and a lateral viscous diffusion sets the characteristic width of the eigenfunctions and determines the damping rates of the modes .",
    "dintrans & ouyed ( 2001 ) used similar methods to calculate inertial waves in a slowly rotating polytrope at more modest ekman numbers , with potential application to jovian seismology .",
    "they considered a pure inertial wave problem , eliminating acoustic and gravity waves by adopting the anelastic approximation and using a neutrally buoyant model .",
    "indeed , in contrast to either high - mass or solar - type stars in close binaries , the entire envelope of a gaseous giant planet is likely to be convective except for a shallow atmospheric layer .",
    "in contrast to the assumption adopted by ioannou & lindzen ( 1993b ) , efficient heat transport by convection prevents the propagation or excitation of g - mode oscillations .",
    "inertial modes , however , can propagate throughout the planetary envelope .",
    "jupiter s spin frequency is a significant fraction of its dynamical frequency and is more than twice the orbital frequencies of the galilean satellites .",
    "short - period extrasolar planets probably formed as rapid rotators similar to jupiter and saturn , although most of them may have already established a state of synchronous rotation . in each case",
    "the tidal forcing occurs in the frequency range of inertial waves , which will therefore constitute the natural and dominant response of the planet .",
    "moreover , in this frequency range , the coriolis coupling between the radial and angular motions is strong and the traditional approximation is inappropriate . therefore two - dimensional computations are required .      in this paper",
    ", we revisit the issue of the excitation and dissipation of dynamical tides within gaseous giant planets .",
    "the response of the planet to low - frequency tidal forcing separates naturally into an equilibrium tide and a dynamical tide . in the convective regions of the planet",
    "the dynamical tide takes the form of inertial waves and we consider a turbulent viscosity associated with convective eddies to act on the tidal disturbance .",
    "if the planet has an outer radiative layer , outwardly propagating hough waves are also excited and we consider them to be damped in the atmosphere . we therefore allow , in principle , for three avenues of tidal dissipation : viscous dissipation of the equilibrium tide , viscous dissipation of inertial waves , and emission of hough waves .",
    "our analysis permits the planet to rotate differentially , although we focus on the case of uniform rotation in our numerical calculations .",
    "in section  2 , we briefly recapitulate the different components of the tidal potential that are responsible for evolution towards synchronization of the planet s spin and circularization of its orbit . in section  3",
    ", we carry out an analysis of low - frequency oscillation modes in a rotating planet .",
    "we formulate the perturbation equations governing both the convective and radiative regions of the planet s interior and analyze the matching conditions between these regions . in section  4 ,",
    "we consider the tidally forced disturbances , including the equilibrium tide , the dynamical response in both regions , and the matching across the interface .",
    "we construct , in section  5 , two numerical schemes to obtain global solutions of the forced perturbation equations . in section  6",
    "we present and discuss numerical results appropriate for the internal structure of gaseous giant planets . in section  7 , we compare our results with those obtained in previous investigations .",
    "we summarize our findings and discuss their implications in section  8 .",
    "we consider two bodies in a mutual keplerian orbit , and adopt a non - rotating coordinate system with origin at the center of body  1 . in our study body  1 will be a giant planet and body  2 its host star .",
    "let @xmath13 be the position vector of an arbitrary point @xmath14 in body  1 , and let @xmath15 be the position vector of the center of mass of body  2 .",
    "when evaluating the tidal force acting within body  1 it is usually adequate to treat body  2 as a point mass , i.e. , to neglect its rotational and tidal deformation .",

    "component  1 can be neglected because it is independent of time and causes only a hydrostatic distortion of the planet but no tidal dissipation .",
    "the effective forcing frequencies of the remaining four components are @xmath41 this prescription assumes that the rotation axis of the planet is perpendicular to its orbit .",
    "otherwise an additional component of the tidal potential appears at first order in the obliquity , having @xmath42 and @xmath43 , and therefore @xmath44 .    in the special case of a uniformly rotating planet , the forcing frequency of component  @xmath39",
    "lies in the spectrum of inertial waves if @xmath45 . in this frequency range ,",
    "the coriolis coupling between the radial and angular motions is strong ( savonije et al . 1995 ) . for any planet",
    "being spun down by tidal dissipation towards a synchronized state ( i.e. , @xmath46 ) , all four effective forcing frequencies lie within the spectrum of inertial waves , as illustrated in fig .  1 .",
    "once synchronism is achieved ( i.e. , @xmath47 ) , component  2 ceases to cause tidal dissipation but , if the orbit remains elliptical , the three eccentric components of the tidal potential continue to provide forcing at @xmath48 , clearly within the spectrum of inertial waves .",

    ", we note that the waves carry both energy and angular momentum fluxes , their ratio being the angular pattern speed @xmath458 .",
    "when the waves damp , their angular momentum is deposited locally in the planet .",
    "part of the energy of the waves is then required in order to change the spin of the planet , while the remainder is dissipated locally .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the dissipation rate is @xmath459 where @xmath145 is the energy flux in equation ( [ flux_forced ] ) ( factors of @xmath64 and ordering subscripts being omitted ) .    the dissipation rate via the emission of hough waves is naturally expressed in terms of the unit @xmath460 where @xmath461 is a model - dependent , dimensionless quantity .",
    "the first factor in @xmath462 , being the ratio of the density at the convective  radiative boundary to the central density of the polytropic model , is highly uncertain , being possibly in the range @xmath463 for short - period extrasolar planets , according to the models of spherically irradiated and tidally heated planets by bodenheimer et al .",
    "the second factor involves the quantity @xmath464 , which is also very uncertain but is raised only to a weak power . for planets that are distant from their host stars , such as jupiter , @xmath462 is probably so small that tidal dissipation via hough waves is entirely negligible .",
    "according to the conventional theory of the equilibrium tide , in which the efficiency of tidal dissipation is parametrized by a quality factor @xmath0 ( e.g. , goldreich & soter 1966 ) , the tidal dissipation rate in a body of negligible rigidity would be @xmath465 where @xmath466 is the second - order love number , and @xmath467 is a dimensionless number of order @xmath68 .",
    "we can therefore express the numerically determined tidal dissipation rates in terms of effective @xmath0-values given by @xmath468 for jupiter , using the volumetric radius for @xmath67 and the value @xmath469 from gavrilov & zharkov ( 1977 ) , we obtain @xmath470 ; when jupiter is spun down to a period of three days , illustrative of a short - period extrasolar planet , we obtain @xmath471 .",
    "we note that goldreich & soter ( 1966 ) assume that @xmath472 , as for a homogeneous body , and therefore the effective @xmath0-values appropriate for use with their formulae are approximately four times larger than the values we quote below .",

    "the four panels correspond to ekman numbers @xmath473 , @xmath447 , @xmath448 , and @xmath443 .",
    "the quantity plotted is the base-10 logarithm of @xmath474 , which is directly related to the effective @xmath0-value .",
    "the dotted line in panel ( d ) corresponds to a fiducial value of @xmath475 for jupiter , or approximately @xmath476 times higher for a short - period extrasolar planet .",

    "it is clear from fig .  2 that the results become more complicated , and the computations more challenging , as the viscosity is reduced .",
    "the numerical convergence of the solutions is examined in two resolution studies in figs  8 and  9 .",
    "the first of these ( fig .",
    "8) is carried out at a forcing frequency @xmath477 within the spectrum of inertial waves but not associated with an obvious resonant feature .",
    "the figure shows that higher resolution is required at lower ekman numbers , and that the dissipation rate can be either underestimated or overestimated if the resolution is insufficient .",
    "the standard resolution @xmath442 clearly gives numerically converged results for all the ekman numbers considered in fig .  2 . the second resolution study ( fig .",
    "9 ) is carried out at a forcing frequency @xmath478 , which lies near the peak of the largest resonant feature seen in fig .  2 .",
    "in this case the standard resolution is just adequate to capture the peak dissipation rate at @xmath479 with a small error .",
    "10 shows , as a dotted line , an expanded view of part of panel ( d ) of fig .  2 , the graph of viscous dissipation rate for @xmath479 .",
    "the solid line , for comparison , comes from a calculation at @xmath480 , for which the increased numerical resolution @xmath481 was necessary .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "11 illustrates the spatial structure of the velocity field induced by tidal forcing in the convective region .",
    "this calculation , at @xmath482 , is performed at the very high resolution of @xmath444 , and the forcing frequency @xmath483 is chosen to be close to the peak of a large resonance .",
    "we begin by comparing the results for the uniformly rotating planet in the full model ( figs  2 and  3 ) with those obtained under the no - coriolis approximation ( figs  4 and  5 ) .",
    "it is clear that , when the coriolis force is included , a number of resonant features are superimposed on the otherwise smooth variation of the viscous dissipation rate with forcing frequency .",
    "as expected , the resonances are restricted to the interval @xmath484 corresponding to the spectrum of inertial waves in the convective region . for @xmath446",
    "the inertial waves show up as two resonant peaks in the dissipation rate .",
    "however , as @xmath453 is reduced further , a host of resonances come into play .",
    "this trend is consistent with the idea that the spectrum of inertial waves is dense or continuous in the absence of viscosity , while it consists of a discrete set of damped modes in the presence of viscosity . when @xmath446 the discrete nature of the modes is clearly evident , but when @xmath479 the individual resonances can barely be discerned , except for the most prominent examples , and a resonant response is almost guaranteed for any forcing frequency within the spectrum of inertial waves . under the no - coriolis approximation",
    "the convective regions of the planet have no wavelike response and no dynamical tide is excited . the slow , large - scale motion associated with the equilibrium tide",
    "is damped by viscosity , leading to a dissipation rate that vanishes linearly with the viscosity .",
    "the same dependence does not occur in the full model for frequencies within the spectrum of inertial waves .",
    "this behaviour reflects the fact that the characteristic spatial scale of the tidally forced inertial waves diminishes as the viscosity is reduced .",
    "rather as occurs in hydrodynamic turbulence , the dissipation rate then has a non - trivial finite limit as the viscosity tends to zero .",
    "the dissipation rate via hough waves is differently normalized , owing to the model - dependent prefactor @xmath462 .",
    "if this factor is of the order of @xmath463 , as may occur in short - period extrasolar planets , the hough dissipation rate could dominate over the viscous dissipation rate .",
    "a comparison of figs  2 and  3 indicates that the hough dissipation rate responds to the inertial - mode resonances when the full coriolis effect is used .",
    "this result reflects the fact that the hough waves are excited partly by the pressure of the inertial waves at the convective  radiative boundary .",
    "these resonant features become stronger and sharper as the ekman number is reduced , but otherwise the hough dissipation rate is essentially independent of the viscosity .",
    "the feature at @xmath431 is the toroidal mode resonance mentioned in section  [ hough ] . in the neighborhood of this forcing frequency , a global toroidal mode is excited in the radiative region , contrary to the assumptions of this paper , and the hough dissipation rate can not be trusted .",
    "the no - coriolis approximation fails to reproduce any of these features but , generally , significantly overestimates the hough dissipation rate .",
    "this discrepancy may be attributable to the fact that , depending on their frequency , the hough modes are confined by the coriolis force to propagate only in certain ranges of latitude , unlike the g  modes in a non - rotating planet .    now comparing figs  2 and  3 with figs  6 and  7",
    ", we find that , within the inertial region , the traditional approximation gives a totally inaccurate representation of the tidal dissipation rate .",
    "while the traditional approximation does allow for a resonant response in the convective region , the details are quite wrong and the viscous dissipation rate is generally overestimated by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "this difference may occur because of a artificial decoupling between the angular and radial structures of the response that occurs when the traditional approximation is employed .",
    "this decoupling implies that , when the conditions for resonance are met , a global amplification of the response occurs .",
    "we conclude that , within the spectrum of inertial waves , the traditional approximation is , if anything , even worse than the no - coriolis approximation , and should therefore never be used for inertial waves in gaseous giant planets .",
    "returning to the full model , we see clearly from the expanded view in fig .",
    "10 that the viscous dissipation rate does not simply vanish linearly with the viscosity . instead ,",
    "as the ekman number is reduced ( in this case by a factor of @xmath485 ) the resonant peaks become more numerous , sharper , and taller . the frequency - averaged viscous dissipation rate for the interval shown in fig .",
    "10 is very nearly _ independent of the viscosity _ , decreasing by approximately four per cent when the ekman number is reduced by a factor of @xmath485 . in fact , the frequency sampling in fig .",
    "10 is such that the resonant peaks for the case @xmath480 are not perfectly captured , and this inaccuracy may be sufficient to account for the four per cent reduction .",
    "this finding suggests what may be a very important result : although the effective @xmath0-value derived from the dissipation of inertial waves at very low ekman number may be an exceedingly complicated function of the forcing frequency , a robust average @xmath0-value may be obtained that is asymptotically independent of the viscosity as @xmath486 . in appendix",
    "a we present a toy model that may explain this effect .",
    "the toy model , based on a simplified cartesian geometry , has the advantage of possessing an analytical solution from which it can be shown that the frequency - averaged dissipation rate is exactly independent of the viscosity .",
    "we suggest that this property may be typical of situations in which forcing is applied to systems that exhibit a dense or continuous spectrum in the absence of dissipation .",
    "it is conceivable that the dissipation rate , averaged locally in frequency , may be essentially independent of the details of the dissipation mechanism , whether it is due to a navier  stokes viscosity , damping by turbulent convection , or nonlinear wave damping .",
    "we are far from having demonstrated such a result .",
    "nevertheless , our results suggest that a @xmath0-value of the order of @xmath487 can be obtained for jupiter or saturn through this mechanism .",
    "the value for a synchronized short - period extrasolar planet would be some @xmath476 times greater owing to its slower rotation .    fig .",
    "11 illustrates the spatial structure of the tidal response in the convective region . in line with work by rieutord et al .",
    "( 2001 ) on free inertial waves in an incompressible fluid contained in a spherical annulus , we find that the disturbance is localized near rays , which are the characteristics of the spatially hyperbolic equations governing inertial waves , and are seen to reflect many times from the inner and outer boundaries . in a uniformly rotating planet",
    "the rays are straight and a simple relation exists between the wave frequency and the angle made by the rays with the vertical .",
    "a mild near - singularity occurs when the rays approach the axis of rotation .",
    "the overall wave pattern does not appear as neat as that in the calculations by rieutord et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , perhaps because the density is non - uniform , but more probably because of an interference effect between the equilibrium and dynamical tides .",
    "we have also made a very preliminary investigation of the possible effects of differential rotation .",
    "unfortunately , without a reliable theory of how differential rotation is generated by convection and other processes in giant planets and stars , the choice of angular velocity profile is unconstrained .",
    "we considered the case of a linear profile @xmath312 of angular velocity in the convective region .",
    "there are clear similarities between the graphs of viscous dissipation rate versus forcing frequency ( which we omit here ) and those shown in fig .  2 for a uniformly rotating planet . even with a differential rotation of @xmath488 per cent , however , the resonant response is substantially richer and stronger .",
    "the tidal response also looks qualitatively similar to that shown in fig .  11 , although the rays are curved in a differentially rotating planet .",
    "we emphasize that we have not considered the possible effects of corotation resonances .",
    "while such resonances in the radiative region may absorb outgoing hough waves , as noted by goldreich & nicholson ( 1989 ) , there may also be a direct tidal torque and energy dissipation associated with tidal forcing at the corotation resonance , as occurs in differentially rotating disks ( e.g. , goldreich & tremaine 1980 ) .",
    "there is also the possibility of an angular velocity that depends on latitude .",
    "the numerical method used in this paper is not well suited to such a situation , unless @xmath175 depends in a sufficiently simple way on @xmath171 that the couplings between different spherical - harmonic components of the velocity field are strongly restricted .",
    "therefore there remains much to be investigated with regard to tides in differentially rotating planets and stars .",
    "the previous work most closely related to the present paper is that by savonije & papaloizou ( 1997 ) and papaloizou & savonije ( 1997 ) .",
    "the former paper presents a numerical analysis of the linearized response of a uniformly rotating high - mass star to @xmath357 tidal forcing . unlike the planet considered in our calculations ,",
    "the star is predominantly radiative and has only a small convective core . in comparison with our study ,",
    "savonije & papaloizou ( 1997 ) take a more direct numerical approach to the full linearized equations , including non - adiabatic effects and a small viscosity , but retaining only terms of first order in the angular velocity . perhaps because the convective core is small , they find that main effects of rotation occur through the resonant excitation of hough modes in the radiative region , rather than inertial modes in the convective region .",
    "indeed , they find a number of toroidal mode resonances for negative forcing frequencies , whereas precisely one such resonance is allowed in our analysis .",
    "our calculation is more dedicated to the exacting task of resolving the tidally forced inertial waves in the convective region and examining more carefully the limit of small viscosity .",
    "the reduction of the basic equations that we carry out allows us to solve the resulting equations much more efficiently , and the numerical method that we employ is particularly well suited to this problem .",
    "the accompanying paper by papaloizou & savonije ( 1997 ) provides an asymptotic analysis of low - frequency tidal forcing in the same type of star .",
    "there is much in common between their concisely expressed analysis and the present paper .",
    "we have attempted to give a fuller exposition of the problem , formally justifying the approximations involved and allowing for the important possibility of differential rotation .",
    "we have thereby generalized the derivation of reduced equations for inertial modes and hough modes .",
    "furthermore , our analysis should be useful for future direct numerical simulations of tides , as it clarifies the role of the anelastic and cowling approximations .",
    "these approximations are satisfied by the dynamical tide but not by the equilibrium tide ( in papaloizou & savonije 1997 the effect of self - gravitation on the equilibrium tide is neglected ) .",
    "related work for non - rotating stars and planets has also been published by goldreich & nicholson ( 1989 ) , lubow et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , and goodman & dickson ( 1998 ) , who arrive at asymptotic expressions for the tidal dissipation rate through the emission of g  modes at a convective  radiative interface .",
    "there is a close formal relation between these expressions and our equation ( [ flux_forced ] ) .",
    "however , the expression can only be evaluated , in the case of a rotating star or planet , if the inertial wave problem in the convective region has been solved numerically . in this connection",
    "it would be interesting to re - examine the problem of tidal forcing in rotating solar - type stars with convective envelopes ( cf .",
    "terquem et al .",
    "1998 ; goodman & dickson 1998 ) taking into account either uniform or differential rotation . in the latter case the angular velocity profile of the solar convective envelope , inferred from helioseismic studies , could be used as a guide .",
    "in this paper we have revisited the classical problem of the response of a giant planet to low - frequency tidal forcing .",
    "much of our general analysis of this problem applies equally to tidal forcing in stars .",
    "the novel feature of our approach is that we take into account the slow and possibly non - uniform rotation of the planet .",
    "( here ` slow ' rotation means that we include the full coriolis force but not the centrifugal distortion of the planet . )",
    "convective regions of the planet then support low - frequency inertial waves with an intricate spatial structure and a rich frequency spectrum , while radiative regions support ( generalized ) hough modes , some of which may be regarded as g  modes of high radial order , modified by the ( differential ) rotation .",
    "we have argued that , in many cases of interest , such as that of an extrasolar planet that orbits close to its host star , the effective tidal forcing frequency lies within the spectrum of inertial waves in the convective regions of the planet , and a resonant response can be expected . as a result , the rate of tidal dissipation may be greatly enhanced relative to a model that neglects the rotation of the planet .",
    "the dissipation occurs both through the viscous or turbulent dissipation of the inertial waves in the convective region and through the emission of generalized hough waves that propagate through the radiative envelope towards the surface , where they presumably damp .",
    "enhancement of the tidal dissipation rate implies a more rapid synchronization of the planet s spin with its orbit , a faster circularization of the orbit , and a more intense heating of the planet , which may lead in turn to inflation and even roche - lobe overflow ( gu et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "we have presented a systematic asymptotic analysis of the linearized response of a differentially rotating planet to tidal forcing with a frequency that is small compared to the dynamical frequency of the planet .",
    "the response separates naturally into an equilibrium tide , which represents a large - scale , quasi - hydrostatic distortion of the planet in the imposed tidal potential , and a dynamical tide , which constitutes a mostly wavelike correction .",
    "we obtain the reduced system of equations governing the dynamical tide in convective and radiative regions separately , and explain the asymptotic matching procedure between the two solutions .    in convective regions , which we model as being adiabatically stratified",
    ", the dynamical tide takes the form of an indirectly forced inertial wave confined in a spherical annulus .",
    "the reduced equations are intrinsically two - dimensional and require a numerical solution . moreover , for effective forcing frequencies within the dense or continuous spectrum of free inertial waves , the problem is mathematically ill - posed unless viscosity is included . a question of particular interest is how the dissipation rate varies with the viscosity in the limit that the viscosity tends to zero .",
    "in radiative regions , the dynamical tide involves predominantly horizontal motions and takes the form of a wave ( or evanescent disturbance ) with a short radial wavelength .",
    "a separation of variables is possible , and we find that the angular structure of the wave is governed by a generalization of laplace s tidal operator .",
    "we call the resulting solutions generalized hough modes and discuss some mathematical properties of the operator concerned .",
    "our analysis clarifies the role in the tidal problem of certain well known approximations to the equations of fluid dynamics .",
    "we find that the so - called traditional approximation , in which the latitudinal component of the angular velocity is neglected , is not applicable to inertial waves in convective regions and should never be used for this purpose .",
    "in fact , it gives highly misleading results for the tidal dissipation rate , perhaps worse than neglecting the coriolis force altogether . on the positive side",
    ", we argue that the dynamical tide satisfies both the anelastic and cowling approximations , which eliminate acoustic waves and self - gravitation , respectively , from the problem .",
    "however , the equilibrium tide satisfies neither of these approximations .",
    "these considerations are important not only for analytical or semi - analytical studies but also for direct numerical simulations of tidal forcing .",
    "such simulations will be needed in order to determine properly how the dynamical tide interacts with turbulent convection , as well as the role of nonlinearity in the tidal problem .",
    "it is highly convenient and appropriate to simulate convection with a numerical method based on the anelastic and cowling approximations .",
    "our analysis indicates that the dynamical tide can also be captured within this approach , and shows how the subtle , indirect forcing of the dynamical tide by the equilibrium tide can be achieved through the inertial terms in the equation of motion .",
    "we have presented the results of full numerical calculations of the tidal response for an idealized model of a giant planet that is predominantly convective but also contains a solid core and has a thin radiative envelope .",
    "the numerical method is suited to the case of ` shellular ' rotation in which the angular velocity is independent of latitude , and we have focused mainly on the case of uniform rotation .",
    "high - resolution calculations , using a pseudospectral method , are required to access the physically interesting regime of small ekman number ( small viscosity ) and reveal the intricate spatial structure of the inertial waves while properly resolving the dissipative structures .",
    "we have calculated the tidal dissipation rate , both by viscous dissipation in the convective region and via the emission of hough waves , as a function of the tidal forcing frequency , for the important case of a tidal potential proportional to the @xmath357 solid harmonic , and for forcing frequencies that span the spectrum of inertial waves .",
    "we find that the viscous dissipation rate is strongly enhanced , relative to a calculation in which the coriolis force is neglected , in a number of inertial - mode resonant peaks that become more numerous , sharper , and taller as the ekman number is reduced . as a result",
    ", the viscous dissipation rate does not vanish linearly with the viscosity . depending on the physical conditions at the convective  radiative boundary",
    ", the hough dissipation rate may possibly exceed the viscous dissipation rate , and also responds to the inertial - mode resonances .",
    "a single ` toroidal mode resonance ' is also possible , in which residual forcing excites a large - scale mode ( related to a rossby wave ) , rather than a short - wavelength response , in the radiative region .",
    "when the planet rotates differentially , the inertial - mode resonances are yet stronger and more numerous , and the viscous dissipation rate is further enhanced .",
    "examination of the spatial structure of the tidal response in the convective region shows , in line with work by rieutord et al .",
    "( 2001 ) on free inertial waves in an incompressible fluid contained in a spherical annulus , that the disturbance is localized near rays , which are the characteristics of the spatially hyperbolic equations governing inertial waves , and are seen to reflect many times from the inner and outer boundaries .",
    "the rays are straight or curved depending on whether the planet rotates uniformly or differentially .",
    "the dissipation rate associated with inertial waves at very low ekman number is , in principle , a highly erratic function of the forcing frequency ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "as we will discuss in future work , when realistic scenarios for tidal evolution are considered , there are various reasons why it may be more appropriate to apply a smoothed version of this ` fractal ' curve rather than taking every resonant peak literally .",
    "we have presented both numerical evidence ( fig .",
    "10 ) , and an analytical demonstration based on a toy model ( appendix  a ) , that the frequency - averaged tidal dissipation rate associated with inertial waves may be asymptotically independent of the viscosity in the limit of small ekman number .",
    "if correct , this result is most important because the ekman number based on the microscopic viscosity in the interior of jupiter is exceptionally small and beyond the range of any numerical calculation .",
    "even the eddy viscosity based on turbulent convection gives rise to a very small ekman number , which should probably be further reduced owing to the mismatch between the typical tidal forcing frequency and the characteristic timescale of the convective motion .",
    "the resulting tidal dissipation rates are not adequately represented by a constant @xmath0-value as is commonly adopted in parametrized models .",
    "one reason for this is that the dissipation rate associated with inertial waves scales naturally with the spin frequency of the planet in a way that is not captured in the constant-@xmath0 model",
    ". nevertheless , the effective @xmath0-values obtained are of the order of @xmath487 for jupiter or saturn , or some @xmath476 times greater for a synchronized short - period extrasolar planet owing to its slower rotation .    these values are probably adequate to explain the historical evolution and current state of the galilean satellites ( e.g. , peale 1999 ) .",
    "we consider the alternative model of ioannou & lindzen ( 1993b ) improbable as it requires the interior of jupiter to be subadiabatically stratified , in contradiction of current models ( guillot et al .",
    "2003 ) which suggest that it has a minuscule superadiabatic gradient owing to the high efficiency with which convection can transport the required heat flux .    in the case of short - period extrasolar planets ,",

    "<S> many extrasolar planets orbit sufficiently close to their host stars that significant tidal interactions can be expected , resulting in an evolution of the spin and orbital properties of the planets . </S>",
    "<S> the accompanying dissipation of energy can also be an important source of heat , leading to the inflation of short - period planets and even mass loss through roche - lobe overflow . </S>",
    "<S> tides may therefore play an important role in determining the observed distributions of mass , orbital period , and eccentricity of the extrasolar planets . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , tidal interactions between gaseous giant planets in the solar system and their moons are thought to be responsible for the orbital migration of the satellites , leading to their capture into resonant configurations .    traditionally , the efficiency of tidal dissipation is simply parametrized by a quality factor @xmath0 , which depends , in principle , in an unknown way on the frequency and amplitude of the tidal forcing . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we treat the underlying fluid dynamical problem with the aim of determining the efficiency of tidal dissipation in gaseous giant planets such as jupiter , saturn , or the short - period extrasolar planets . </S>",
    "<S> efficient convection enforces a nearly adiabatic stratification in these bodies , which may or may not contain rocky cores . with some modifications , our approach can also be applied to fully convective low - mass stars .    in cases of interest , the tidal forcing frequencies are typically comparable to the spin frequency of the planet but are small compared to its dynamical frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore study the linearized response of a slowly and possibly differentially rotating planet to low - frequency tidal forcing . </S>",
    "<S> convective regions of the planet support inertial waves , which possess a dense or continuous frequency spectrum in the absence of viscosity , while any radiative regions support generalized hough waves . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate the relevant equations for studying the excitation of these disturbances and present a set of illustrative numerical calculations of the tidal dissipation rate .    </S>",
    "<S> we argue that inertial waves provide a natural avenue for efficient tidal dissipation in most cases of interest . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting value of @xmath0 depends , in principle , in a highly erratic way on the forcing frequency , but we provide analytical and numerical evidence that the relevant frequency - averaged dissipation rate may be asymptotically independent of the viscosity in the limit of small ekman number . for a smaller viscosity , the tidal disturbance has a finer spatial structure and individual resonances are more pronounced .    in short - period extrasolar planets , </S>",
    "<S> tidal dissipation via inertial waves becomes somewhat less efficient once they are spun down to a synchronous state . </S>",
    "<S> however , if the stellar irradiation of the planet leads to the formation of a radiative outer layer that supports generalized hough modes , the tidal dissipation rate can be enhanced , albeit with significant uncertainty , through the excitation and damping of these waves . </S>",
    "<S> the dissipative mechanisms that we describe offer a promising explanation of the historical evolution and current state of the galilean satellites as well as the observed circularization of the orbits of short - period extrasolar planets . </S>"
