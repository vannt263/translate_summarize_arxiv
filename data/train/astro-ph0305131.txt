    "there are also different proposals to explain the origin of the initial seed .",
    "astrophysical batteries rely on gradients of the charge density concentration and pressure and their efficiency in producing seeds of the necessary amplitude is still very much discussed@xcite",
    ". primordial magnetic fields that could be the seeds for dynamo amplification can be generated at different stages in the history of the early universe , in particular during inflation , preheating and or phase transitions@xcite .",
    "primordial ( hyper ) magnetic fields may have important consequences in electroweak baryogenesis@xcite , big bang nucleosynthesis ( see@xcite ) , the polarization of the cmb@xcite via the same physical processes as faraday rotation , and structure formation@xcite , thus sparking an intense program to study the origin and consequences of the generation of magnetic fields in the early universe@xcite-@xcite .",
    "a reliable estimate of the amplitude and correlations of seed magnetic fields must include the dissipative properties of the plasma , in particular the conductivity@xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite we have introduced a formulation that allows to compute the generation of magnetic fields from processes strongly out of equilibrium .",
    "this formulation , which is based on the exact set of schwinger - dyson equations for the transverse photon propagator is manifestly gauge invariant and is general for any matter fields and any cosmological background ( conformally related to minkowski space - time ) . in the case in which strongly out of equilibrium effects arise from long - wavelength fluctuations , such as during phase transitions , this formulation allows to separate the contribution of the hard degrees of freedom which are in local thermodynamic equilibrium from that of the soft degrees of freedom that fall out of lte ( local thermal equilibrium ) during the phase transition and whose dynamics is strongly out of equilibrium .",
    "this separation of degrees of freedom leads to a consistent incorporation of the dissipative effects via the conductivity ( for details see@xcite ) .",
    "in that reference a study of magnetogenesis in minkowski space - time during a supercooled phase transitions was presented and the results highlighted the main aspects of the generation of magnetic and electric fields in these situations .",
    "we study the generation of large scale ( hyper ) magnetic fields by a cosmological phase transition during a radiation dominated era by implementing the formulation introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the setting is a theory of @xmath0 charged scalar fields coupled to an abelian gauge field ( hypercharge ) .",
    "we consider the situation when this theory undergoes a phase transition after the reheating stage and before either the electroweak or the qcd phase transition , since we expect that these transitions will lead to new physical phenomena .",
    "the non - perturbative dynamics out of equilibrium is studied in the limit of a large number @xmath0 of ( hyper ) charged fields and to leading order in the gauge coupling .",
    "the non - equilibrium dynamics of the charged scalar sector features two distinct stages .",
    "the first one describes the early and intermediate time regime and is dominated by the spinodal instabilities which are the hallmark of the process of phase separation and domain formation and growth .",
    "this stage describes the dynamics between the time at which the phase transition takes place and that at which non - linearities become important via the backreaction .",
    "the second stage corresponds to a _ scaling regime _ which describes the slower non - equilibrium evolution of goldstone bosons and the process of phase ordering@xcite and growth of horizon - sized domains .",
    "this scaling regime is akin to the solution found in the _ classical _ evolution of scalar field models with broken continuous symmetries after the phase transition that form the basis for models of structure formation based on topological defects@xcite .",
    "the solution of the scalar field dynamics @xcite is the input in the expression for the spectrum of the magnetic field obtained in  @xcite to obtain the amplitude of the primordial seed generated during both stages .",
    "we find that scaling stage is the most important for the generation of large scale magnetic fields .",
    "large scale magnetic fields are generated via loop effects from the dynamics of modes that are at the scale of the horizon or smaller .",
    "the leading order processes that result in the generation of large scale magnetic fields are : i ) pair * production * , ii ) pair annihilation and iii ) low energy bremsstrahlung .",
    "these processes would be forbidden in equilibrium by energy momentum conservation , but they are allowed strongly out of equilibrium because of the rapid time evolution of the cosmological background and the fast dynamics of the scalar field fluctuations .",
    "the resulting spectrum is rather insensitive to the diffusion length scale which is much smaller than the horizon during the radiation dominated era .",
    "the ratio of the magnetic energy density on scales larger than @xmath1 ( today ) to the energy density in the background radiation @xmath13 is summarized in a compact formula [ eq.([rreges ] ) ] . for @xmath14 ( today ) we find @xmath15 at the electroweak scale and @xmath16 at the qcd scale , suggesting the possibility that these primordial seeds could be amplified by dynamo mechanisms to the values of the magnetic fields consistent with the observed ones on these scales .",
    "whether a symmetry breaking phase transition occurs in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) or not is a detailed question of time scales .",
    "two important time scales must be compared , the time scale of cooling through the critical temperature @xmath17 and the relaxation time scale of a fluctuation of typical wavelength @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "if cooling through @xmath20 occurs on time scales _ slower _ than the relaxation scale ,",
    "i.e , @xmath21 then a fluctuation of wavevector @xmath18 adjusts to lte and for these scales the phase transition occurs in lte . on the other hand if @xmath22 fluctuations of wavelength @xmath23 can not adjust to the conditions of lte and fall out of equilibrium , i.e , _ freeze out _ and for these scales the phase transition occurs on very short time scales like a quench from a high temperature phase into a low temperature phase  @xcite .",
    "while short wavelength modes typically have very short relaxation time scales and remain in lte during the phase transition , long - wavelength modes undergo critical slowing down near @xmath20 and their relaxational dynamics becomes very slow@xcite .",
    "thus as the temperature nears the critical with a non - vanishing cooling rate , long - wavelength modes freeze out falling out of lte , namely for these modes the phase transition occurs out of equilibrium . in theories in which the _ equilibrium _ phase transition is of second order ,",
    "the _ non - equilibrium _ dynamics below the critical temperature is described by the process of _ spinodal decomposition _ : long - wavelength fluctuations become unstable and grow . in minkowski space - time",
    "this growth is exponential in time but in an expanding cosmology the growth will depend on the time dependence of the scale factor .",
    "the growth of long - wavelength fluctuations entails that the field becomes correlated within regions characterized by a time - dependent correlation length @xmath24 and the amplitude of the long - wavelength fluctuations becomes non - perturbatively large .",
    "the non - perturbative amplitudes of long - wavelength fluctuations , becoming of @xmath25 with @xmath26 the scalar self - coupling are a consequence of the fact that the mean - square root fluctuation of the field probes the broken symmetry states with @xmath27 with @xmath26 .",
    "this is the hallmark of the process of phase separation , the correlated regions correspond to domains , inside these domains the field is near one of the vacuum states . a particular time scale , the nonlinear time @xmath28 , determines the transition from a regime of linear instabilities to one in which the full non - linearities become important .",
    "this time scale roughly corresponds to when the mean square root fluctuation of the scalar field samples the broken symmetry states and the phase transition is almost complete . at this stage",
    "the amplitude of the long - wavelength fluctuations become of @xmath29 , the phases freeze out and the long - wavelength fluctuations become _ classical _ but stochastic@xcite-@xcite .",
    "consider now the situation where the scalar field carries an abelian charge and is coupled to the electromagnetic gauge field .",
    "the strong spinodal fluctuations in the scalar field will induce fluctuations in the current - current correlation function , and while the expectation value of the current must vanish by translational and rotational invariance , the current and charge correlators will have strong non - equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "these current fluctuations will in turn generate a magnetic field with a typical wavelength corresponding to the wavelength of the spinodally unstable modes .",
    "this is the main premise of this article : the spinodal instabilities which are the hallmark of a non - equilibrium symmetry breaking phase transition will lead to strong charge and current fluctuations of the charged scalar fields which in turn , lead to the generation of magnetic fields through the non - equilibrium evolution .",
    "the main ingredients that must be developed in order to understand the generation of magnetic fields through this non - equilibrium process are :    * a consistent framework to compute the spectrum of generated magnetic field , namely @xmath30 with @xmath31 the spatial fourier transform of the heisenberg magnetic field _ operator _ and @xmath32 the ( comoving ) volume of the system .",
    "* we anticipate that plasma effects must be included to assess the generation and eventual decay of the magnetic fields .",
    "if there is a large conductivity in the medium the magnetic field will diffuse but also its generation will be hindered .",
    "this will be a point of particular importance within the cosmological setting@xcite . *",
    "a major challenge of _ any _ mechanism of large scale magnetogenesis is to generate the seed magnetic fields from microscopic , _ causal _ processes .",
    "an important aspect of the results presented here is that this generation mechanism is mediated by _ loop _ effects and correspond to processes that are forbidden in equilibrium but allowed strongly out of equilibrium .",
    "these ingredients will be analyzed in detail below .",
    "the cosmological setting in which we are primarily interested corresponds to a symmetry breaking phase transition in a radiation dominated universe .",
    "such phase transition is in principle different from the electroweak one and presumably occurs at a much higher energy scale , such as the gut scale @xmath33 but is assumed to be described by a particle physics model that includes many fields with ( hyper)-charge either fermionic or bosonic . we will not attempt to study a particular gauge theory phenomenologically motivated by some gut scenario , but will focus our study on a generic scalar field model in which the scalar fields carry an abelian ( hyper)charge .",
    "the simplest realization of such model is scalar electrodynamics with @xmath0 charged scalar fields @xmath34 and one neutral scalar field @xmath35 whose expectation value is the order parameter associated with the phase transition .",
    "the neutral field is not coupled to the gauge field and its acquiring an expectation value does not break the @xmath36 gauged symmetry .",
    "this guarantees that the abelian gauge symmetry identified with either hypercharger or electromagnetism is _ not spontaneously broken _ to describe the correct low energy sector with unbroken @xmath37 .",
    "we will take the neutral and the @xmath0 complex ( charged ) fields to form a scalar multiplet under an @xmath38 isospin symmetry .",
    "the electromagnetic coupling explicitly breaks the @xmath38 symmetry down to @xmath39 . in the absence of electromagnetic coupling",
    "as the neutral field acquires an expectation value the isospin symmetry is spontaneously broken to @xmath40 .",
    "since by construction only the neutral field acquires a non vanishing expectation value under the isospin symmetry breaking the photon remains massless ( it will obtain a debye screening mass from medium effects , see discussion below ) .    the action that describes this theory in a general cosmological background is given by @xmath41\\ ] ] where @xmath42 \\ ; .\\ ] ] and @xmath43 furthermore , anticipating a non - perturbative treatment of the non - equilibrium dynamics of the scalar sector in a large @xmath0 expansion , we have rescaled the quartic coupling in such a way as to display the contributions in terms of powers of @xmath44 , keeping @xmath26 fixed in the large @xmath0 limit .    a friedmann - robertson - walker line element @xmath45",
    "is conformally related to a minkowski line element by introducing the conformal time @xmath46 and scale factor @xmath47 as @xmath48 in terms of these the line element and metric are given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the minkowski metric . introducing the conformal fields @xmath51 and in terms of the conformal time",
    ", the action now reads @xmath52\\ ] ] with @xmath53 and the primes refer to derivatives with respect to conformal time .",
    "obviously the conformal rescaling of the metric and fields turned the action into that of a charged scalar field interacting with a gauge field in _ flat minkowski space - time _ , but the scalar field acquires a time dependent mass term . in particular , in the absence of electromagnetic coupling , the equations of motion for the gauge field @xmath54 are those of a free field in flat space time .",
    "this is the statement that gauge fields are _ conformally _ coupled to gravity and no generation of electromagnetic fields can occur from gravitational expansion alone without coupling to other fields or breaking the conformal invariance of the gauge sector .",
    "the generation of electromagnetic fields must arise from a coupling to other fields that are not conformally coupled to gravity , or by adding extra terms in the lagrangian that would break the conformal invariance of the gauge fields@xcite .",
    "the conformal electromagnetic fields @xmath55 are related to the physical @xmath56 fields by the conformal rescaling @xmath57 corresponding to fields of scaling dimension two .",
    "* gauge invariance : * since we will study the generation of magnetic fields through loop effects and keeping only low order terms in the diagrammatic expansion , it is important to guarantee that the results obtained are _ gauge invariant _ , namely physical .",
    "a gauge invariant formulation leads to the following lagrangian density ( for details see@xcite ) @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a gauge invariant _ local _ field which is non - locally related to the original fields , and @xmath60 is the transverse component of the vector field ( @xmath61 ) and @xmath62 is a non - propagating field as befits a lagrange multiplier , its dynamics is completely determined by that of the charge density  @xcite .",
    "the main point of this discussion is that the framework to obtain the power spectrum of the generated magnetic field presented below is fully _ gauge invariant_.",
    "we consider here a phase transition in a radiation dominated cosmology in a theory with a critical temperature near but below a gut scale , and we take the reheating temperature of the post - inflationary universe to be higher than the critical temperature . furthermore we assume that after reheating the universe is described by a state of local thermodynamic equilibrium and the background radiation dominates the dynamics of the hubble expansion .    in this",
    "radiation dominated cosmology , as the initial state local thermodynamic equilibrium at an initial temperature @xmath63 the expansion results in cooling and the temperature eventually falls below the critical triggering the phase transition .",
    "using finite temperature field theory in an expanding background geometry , it is shown  @xcite that the effective time dependent mass term depends on the effective time dependent temperature @xmath64 ( see discussion below ) which reflects the cooling from the cosmological expansion .",
    "hence at a given time the temperature equals the critical and the phase transition occurs .",
    "field modes with wavectors much larger than the symmetry breaking scale @xmath65 will remain in lte and will not be affected by the symmetry breaking dynamics@xcite , but those with wavevectors much smaller than the symmetry breaking scale will fall our of equilibrium and become spinodally unstable@xcite .",
    "we normalize the scaling factor @xmath47 at the reheating time @xmath66 in such a way that @xmath67 then the explicit expression for @xmath47 reads @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the hubble constant at the reheating time , @xmath70",
    ".    we can relate @xmath69 to the reheating temperature and the planck mass @xmath71 through the equation @xmath72 and the einstein - friedman equation @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the effective number of degrees of freedom at the reheating temperature and we introduced the scale @xmath75 of the order of the planck mass @xmath76 in radiation dominated epoch the time - dependence of the mass term ( [ masconf ] ) is given by the expression @xmath77 where we see the emergence of a new mass scale @xmath78 this scale will play an important role in the following discussion and in the comparison with results obtained in minkowski space - time@xcite .",
    "there is a last scale which plays a relevant role , the horizon scale @xmath79 which is fixed by the evolution on the time of the hubble constant : @xmath80 modes with physical wavelength @xmath81 inside the horizon @xmath82 are causally connected , modes outside the horizon are causally disconnected .",
    "the relaxation rate of hard modes of the charged fields is given by@xcite @xmath83 where the effective temperature varies with time as @xmath84 and the expansion rate given by @xmath85 therefore , @xmath86 } \\ ; .\\ ] ] thus hard modes are in thermal equilibrium for @xmath87 .",
    "in particular , modes with @xmath88 are the hard modes that give the leading contribution to the conductivity in the high temperture limit@xcite . modes with @xmath89 will manifest the long - wavelength spinodal instabilities and their dynamics will be strongly out of equilibrium@xcite .",
    "their amplitude becomes non - perturbatively large@xcite and will be responsible for the non - equilibrium generation of the primordial magnetic field@xcite .    using eqs.([c - rde ] ) and ( [ tef ] ) we can write the conformal time as @xmath90 as it will become clear below an important cosmological quantity is the product @xmath91 the ratio @xmath92 is a kinematical invariant .",
    "its value today is determined by the scale @xmath1 which will be typically chosen to correspond to a galactic scale or the scale of galaxy clusters , and the temperature of the cmb .",
    "it is given by , @xmath93 therefore , @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "thus , during the regime of interest in this article , @xmath96 for scales of galaxy clusters . a noteworthy aspect of eq.([horiz ] ) is that the wavelengths corresponding to the scale of galaxies or clusters today were well outside the horizon during the radiation dominated era when the electroweak and qcd phase transitions occurred .",
    "thus the challenge for any mechanism of primordial magnetogenesis operating on scales well inside the hubble radius , such as causal microscopic processes , must generate magnetic fields with wavelengths which are much larger than the hubble radius .",
    "another important quantity is the ratio of the wavevector @xmath18 of the primordial magnetic field to the conductivity .",
    "as it will be discussed below , the physical conductivity is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is a constant of @xmath99 , @xmath100 is the number of ultrarelativistic charged species , and we have neglected the ( logarithmic ) dependence on the energy scale in the running coupling constant . for this discussion",
    "we will neglect the time dependence of @xmath100 assuming that the number of charged ultrarelativistic species remains constant ( this assumption can be relaxed without qualitative modifications of the main argument ) . under this assumption @xmath101 with @xmath102 being the _ comoving _ conductivity determined at the time of reheating @xmath103 thus the ratio , @xmath104 neglecting logarithmic corrections .    furthermore , @xmath105 where we have neglected logarithmic corrections .",
    "therefore @xmath106 throughout the radiation dominated era considered in this article .",
    "the regime @xmath107 is dominated by the ( slow ) hydrodynamic relaxation of the magnetic field .",
    "another relevant estimate involves the ( comoving ) _ diffusion length _",
    "@xmath109 where again we have neglected logarithmic terms .",
    "therefore the diffusion length is much smaller than the hubble radius during the radiation dominated era . finally , combining ( [ difflength ] ) and ( [ horiz ] ) we find @xmath110 between reheating and the time of the qcd phase transition .",
    "the contribution from the hard modes of both the charged scalar and gauge fields which remain in local thermodynamic equilibrium lead to an effective mass for the scalar field .",
    "this _ thermal _ mass is obtained from the long - wavelength limit of the scalar field self - energy and includes the hard thermal loop contributions from the gauge and scalar fields@xcite .",
    "this thermal mass is given by @xmath111 finally , another important quantity is the debye screening length that determines the scale at which long - range forces are screened by the polarizability of the medium . in an ultrarelativistic plasma ,",
    "the comoving debye screening length is given by@xcite @xmath112 the ratio of the debye screening length to the hubble radius is given by @xmath113 hence @xmath114 for @xmath115 , thus long range forces are screened over very short distances .",
    "the formation of long - wavelength domains with typical size of the order of the hubble radius@xcite leading to strong charge and current fluctuations that will seed magnetic fields , will not be hindered by long - range forces , which are effectively screened over sub - horizon distances .",
    "magnetic field generation via charge asymmetries during a period in which electromagnetism was spontaneously broken was previously studied by dolgov and silk@xcite who argued that long - range forces would be screened by the higgs mechanism .",
    "this is different from the situation studied in this article , where the @xmath36 symmetry associated with electromagnetism ( rather hypercharge ) is _ not _ spontaneously broken .",
    "long range forces are screened by the plasma , a situation not considered in@xcite .      for completeness and to highlight the aspects of the non - equilibrium dynamics most relevant to the generation of magnetic fields ,",
    "we summarize the main features of scalar field dynamics . for further details the reader",
    "is referred to  @xcite . in what follows",
    "we will neglect the backreaction of the gauge fields on the dynamics of the scalar fields .",
    "the rationale for this is that the main non - equilibrium processes that lead to magnetogenesis will be non - perturbative in the _ scalar _ sector and result from the instabilities associated with the phase transition .",
    "the contribution from the gauge fields , in the form of self - energies for the scalar fields , do not feature the instabilities associated with the phase transition and will , furthermore , be suppressed at least by one power of @xmath116 the ( hyper ) electromagnetic coupling constant as compared to the scalar self - interaction .",
    "as described above , the non - equilibrium evolution of long - wavelength modes begins with the spinodal instabilities which result in an exponential growth of the amplitudes for long - wavelength fluctuations . when the non - linearity becomes of the same order as the tree - level terms in the equations of motion , the back reaction of these fluctuations shuts - off the instabilities   @xcite .",
    "therefore a non - perturbative treatment of the dynamics is required .",
    "the large @xmath0 limit of the scalar sector allows a systematic non - perturbative treatment of the dynamics which is renormalizable and maintains the conservation laws@xcite .",
    "we will therefore study the dynamics in leading order in the large @xmath0 limit that already reveals the important non - equilibrium features of the evolution .",
    "the contribution from the gauge fields to the equations of motion of the long - wavelength modes of the scalar fields arise through self - energy corrections .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath116 these are dominated by the hard modes of the gauge fields ( hard thermal loops ) which lead to a contribution to the thermal mass given by @xmath117  @xcite and had already been accounted for in the thermal mass ( [ thermalmass ] ) .",
    "the _ non - equilibrium _ effects in the gauge contribution of the scalar self - energy will arise from polarization loops in the intermediate photon lines and are , therefore , of @xmath118 . since our calculation will be to lowest order in @xmath116",
    ", we will neglect these contributions .",
    "thus , to this order the gauge field contribution to the scalar self - energy is accounted for in the thermal mass .",
    "hence the dynamics of the scalar field is studied along the same lines as presented in refs .  @xcite but the only difference is in the initial conditions in the modes that reflect the thermal mass in lte .    since symmetry breaking",
    "is chosen along the direction of the neutral field @xmath119 we write @xmath120 where the expectation value is taken in the time evolved density matrix or initial state .",
    "the leading order in the large n limit is obtained either by introducing an auxiliary field and establishing the saddle point or equivalently by the factorizations@xcite @xmath121 the non - linear terms of the @xmath122 field lead to contributions of @xmath123 in the large @xmath124 limit , and to leading order the dynamics is completely determined by the @xmath124 complex scalars @xmath125 .",
    "this factorization that leads to the leading contribution in the large @xmath124 limit makes the lagrangian for the scalar fields quadratic ( in the absence of the gauge coupling ) at the expense of a self - consistent condition : thus charged fields @xmath59 acquire a self - consistent time dependent mass .",
    "the dynamics is determined by the heisenberg equations of motion of the neutral field @xmath126 and the charged fields @xmath127  @xcite . we will consider that at the onset of the radiation dominated era , the system is in the symmetric high temperature phase in local thermal equilibrium with a vanishing expectation value for the scalar fields . in the absence of explicit symmetry",
    "breaking perturbations the expectation value of the scalar field will remain zero throughout the evolution , thus @xmath128 .",

    "the initial conditions on the mode functions @xmath132 depend on the value of the wavevector @xmath18 as compared to the horizon scale @xmath133 at the reheating time :    * @xmath134 : for fluctuations inside the horizon , we may assume thermal quasi - particle boundary conditions at the reheating temperature : @xmath135 where the frequencies @xmath136 are quasi - particle frequencies with thermal mass @xmath137 given by eq.([thermalmass ] ) at the reheating temperature , @xmath138 for these modes the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium is well motivated and we have @xmath139 * @xmath140 : for superhorizon fluctuations , which are causally disconnected at the reheating time , we can not assume a thermalized distribution .",
    "the correct distribution has to be derived by following the dynamics from the inflationary stage , when the fluctuations were well inside the horizon .",
    "while a complete discussion of the initial conditions is left to a forthcoming article , the case under consideration we will see that the dependence on the initial conditions is rather weak and only during the initial stages of the phase transition . for the later stages , dominated by the scaling solution described below ,",

    "a very important aspect that must be taken into account in the dynamics of gauge fields is the electric conductivity , which leads to dissipative processes .",

    "long wavelength modes , those with wavectors of the order of or smaller than the symmetry breaking scale undergo critical slowing down and fall out of equilibrium during the phase transition .",
    "these modes become spinodally unstable during the early stages of the transition as summarized above and analyzed in detail in refs .",

    "thus the contributions from the charged particle fluctuations to the photon polarization must be separated into two very different regimes : a ) the hard momenta @xmath247 correspond to charge fluctuations that are always in local thermodynamic equilibrium , b ) the soft momenta @xmath248 fall out of equilibrium and undergo long - wavelength spinodal instabilities and enter the scaling regime .    the contribution from hard momenta will lead to a large _ equilibrium _ conductivity in the medium , while the contribution to the polarization from soft momenta will contain all the non - equilibrium dynamics that lead to the generation of electromagnetic field fluctuations .    as the instabilities during the phase transition develop , the fluctuations of the charged fields will generate non - equilibrium fluctuations in the long - wavelength components of the electric and magnetic fields with the ensuing generation of long - wavelength magnetic fields .",
    "however the large conductivity of the medium will hinder the generation of electromagnetic fluctuations , hence the conductivity must be fully taken into account to assess the spectrum of the magnetic and electric fields generated during the non - equilibrium stage@xcite .",
    "we are interested in the generation of long wavelength magnetic fields , namely @xmath249 but also @xmath250 , since within the astrophysical application , the wavelength of interest for magnetic fields are of galactic scale , while @xmath156 corresponds to a wavelength at the peak of the cmb which today is @xmath251 .",

    "the correct scaling dynamics can not be captured within the kinetic description either since it describes the evolution of coherent domains correlated on scales comparable to the hubble radius .",
    "thus the formulation presented here based on the schwinger - dyson equations provides the necessary calculational scheme to describe reliably from first principles the generation of magnetic fields during and after non - equilibrium phase transitions .    in order to reveal the enhancement during the scaling regime in a more transparent manner ,",
    "it is convenient to use the relations ( [ h - t ] ) , ( [ eta.t ] ) , ( [ crittemp ] ) and the explicit expression for the conductivity ( [ sigmacond ] ) in the form @xmath515\\ ; \\frac { n~t_r}\\alpha \\quad , \\quad c[\\alpha , n ] \\equiv \\frac{\\mathcal{c}}{\\ln[\\frac{1}{\\alpha \\ ,",

    "we note that in the final result ( [ rreges ] ) there is no dependence on the reheating temperature but only on the scale of symmetry breaking @xmath65 , the temperature at the time @xmath46 and the scalar and gauge couplings .",
    "this is expected since the non - equilibrium processes begin in earnest after the phase transition , local thermal equilibrium prevailed between the time of reheating and the phase transition .",
    "the dependence on the scalar self coupling @xmath519 is a hallmark of the non - perturbative nature of the growth of unstable modes and spinodal decomposition , it is ubiquitous in the non - equilibrium dynamics of phase transitions@xcite .",
    "large scale magnetogenesis is more efficient for large symmetry breaking scale @xmath65 , since the larger the symmetry breaking scale , the longer lasts the scaling stage .",
    "consider for instance the case in which the symmetry breaking scale @xmath520 and @xmath521 , corresponding to a critical temperature of order of a gut scale @xmath177 and suppose that the scaling regime lasts until the electroweak phase transition scale , i.e. @xmath46 is such that @xmath522 .",
    "then the factor @xmath523 compensates for the factor @xmath524 . taking @xmath0 and @xmath525 of the order of @xmath526 ( these values are taken as representative and they can be changed simply in the final expressions ) we can write the expression for the ratio as @xmath527 therefore @xmath528 thus if the scaling regime lasts until a time between the ew and the qcd phase transitions the amplitude of the large scale magnetic fields is within the range necessary to be amplified by some dynamo models .",
    "the amplitude of the seed magnetic field is strongly dependent on the duration of the scaling regime .",
    "we have only focused on a scaling regime terminating either at the ew or qcd phase transition since there will surely be new phenomena associated with these that must be included in the dynamics of magnetogenesis .      *",
    "* validity of the approximations : * there are two main approximations that were used to obtain the results quoted above , i ) the long - wavelength approximation @xmath96 and ii ) the weak coupling approximation .",
    "we now provide an estimate of the reliability of both these approximations to establish the limit of validity of our results .",
    "+ * i ) : long - wavelength approximation : * in order to reach our final result for the rate @xmath279 we have explicitly used a series of approximations which are valid for long wavelengths but whose validity must be checked before we reach any conclusion regarding the spectrum at _ small _ scales . in particular we must address the limits of applicability of the result ( [ rreges ] ) .",

    "as discussed in the introduction , we are considering a situation in which the magnetic field is considered as a perturbation of a pre - existing thermal blackbody background . for consistency",

    "+ * ii ) : weak electromagnetic coupling : * in order to study the amplitude for much smaller scales the calculations must be done without the long wavelength approximations invoked above . in this case",
    "we must expect a breakdown of perturbation theory and we can not give a reliable estimate in the present framework .",
    "furthermore , for scales well inside the hubble radius , microphysical processes _ not included _ in our approximations , such as scattering between charged fields and between charged and gauge fields must be included .",
    "these processes will restore equilibrium between the different fields , if there is a substantial transfer of power from the charged fluctuations to the radiation field , this may lead to a change in the equation of state and the full backreaction on the metric must be included . at",
    "longer time scales the effects of the backreaction of the gauge fields on the dynamics of the scalar field , as well as the non - equilibrium contributions to equation of state and the friedmann equations must be included self - consistently . *",
    "* generation on short distance scales : * for scales well inside the horizon during the scaling regime , namely @xmath540 , we must account for causal microscopic processes that tend to equilibrate the electromagnetic fields generated by the non - equilibrium processes . in order to understand these processes we must look at the kinetics of equilibration",
    ". the mode functions for wavevectors well inside the horizon are minkowski - like , of the form @xmath541 where the coefficients @xmath542 must be determined from a full numerical evolution .",
    "however the constancy of the wronskian entails that @xmath543 which suggests the identification @xmath544 , @xmath545 is the number of ( asymptotic ) quanta created during the time evolution .",
    "this form of the asymptotic mode functions leads to the equipartition between the electric and magnetic field generation , since spatial and time derivatives are the same .",
    "in turn this entails that we can understand the generation of electric and magnetic fields by obtaining a _ kinetic _",
    "equation for the number of photons .",
    "such kinetic equation must necessarily be of the form @xmath546\\gamma^>_k(\\eta)-n_k(\\eta)\\gamma^<_k(\\eta)\\ ] ] which displays the familiar gain minus loss contributions in terms of the forward and inverse rates .",
    "eventually a steady state will be reached which will describe a stationary distribution of photons .",
    "the computation of the forward [ @xmath547 and inverse [ @xmath548 require a _",
    "detailed _ knowledge of the distribution @xmath545@xcite since these generalized rates are functionals of these occupation numbers .",
    "clearly such computation lies beyond the scope of this article and is a task that we will undertake elsewhere .",
    "however , the kinetic equations above will tend to an equilibrated state of local thermodynamic equilibrium . *",
    "* effect on the lss : * it is important to estimate the effect of the magnetic field on scales corresponding to those of the last scattering surface , which today are @xmath549 . from eq .",
    "( [ finrat ] ) we see that at the electroweak temperature @xmath550 , taking the fourth root we can provide an estimate of the temperature fluctuation induced by the primordial magnetic field @xmath551^{\\frac{1}{4 } } \\sim 10^{-11}$ ] which is negligible compared to the cmb temperature fluctuation at this scale @xmath552 . on the other hand , a similar estimate at the time of the qcd phase transition gives @xmath553 which is marginally compatible with the current observations .",
    "thus the reliability of the approximation of weak gauge coupling combined with the effects on the temperature anisotropy at the last scattering surface seem to lead us to conclude that _ if _ a phase transition during a radiation dominated era occurs near the gut scale and results in a scaling stage , our results for primordial magnetogenesis will be reliable down to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "we review here large scale primordial magnetogenesis during a phase transition in the radiation dominated era after reheating in a model of @xmath0-charged scalars coupled to an abelian gauge field@xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the magnetic field generated during the non - equilibrium evolution was computed using the formulation recently introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the dissipative effects of the conductivity are included by separating the contribution from hard modes ( with momenta of order @xmath334 ) to the polarization tensor of the gauge fields .",
    "these modes are always in local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the non - perturbative , non - equilibrium dynamics of the scalar field after the phase transition was studied in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "the dynamics after the phase transition features two distinct stages : an early and intermediate time , spinodal stage , which is dominated by the growth of long - wavelength fluctuations , followed by a scaling regime during which the scalar field becomes correlated over horizon - sized domains . during both regimes ,",
    "strong non - equilibrium fluctuations lead to large current - current correlation functions which entail the generation of magnetic fields .",
    "the scaling regime is the most effective for primordial magnetogenesis since this stage lasts the longest . during this stage",
    "magnetic fields with superhorizon wavelengths are generated via _ loop _ effects , the scalar field momenta in the polarization loop corresponds to wavelengths of the order of or shorter than the horizon .",
    "thus causal scalar field fluctuations lead to the generation of magnetic fields on superhorizon scales .",
    "in particular the processes that yield the leading contribution to magnetic field generation are i ) : pair production , ii ) pair annihilation and iii ) low energy bremsstrahlung , which can not occur in equilibrium because of energy momentum conservation , but do occur out of equilibrium because of the rapid time evolution due to the expansion and the evolution of the scalar field out of equilibrium .",
    "the generation of magnetic field is hindered by the large conductivity of the plasma and equipartition between electric and magnetic fields does not hold .",
    "the spectrum of the primordial magnetic field is insensitive to the magnetic diffusion length which is sub - horizon during the radiation era .",
    "our final result for the spectrum generated during the scaling regime is given by eq.([sbesf ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the energy density of the magnetic fields on scales larger than @xmath1 to the energy density in the cosmic background radiation @xmath554 is given by equation ( [ rreges ] ) .",
    "for values of @xmath0 , and the gauge coupling consistent with particle physics models we find that @xmath555 therefore , @xmath556 therefore , the large scale primordial magnetic fields generated during the scaling stage after a phase transition may be a plausible mechanism to generate primordial magnetic fields which will be further amplified by the collapse of protogalaxies and by astrophysical dynamos .",
    "probably a phase transition at a temperature much larger than the electroweak leading to a scaling regime lasting until the qcd phase transition is ruled out by the temperature inhomogeneities at the last scattering surface .",
    "furthermore the generation of electromagnetic fields on sub - horizon scales requires a full kinetic equation that incorporates the microscopic causal processes that lead to thermalization , the study of these is beyond the scope of this article .",
    "* magnetogenesis _",
    "after _ the qcd phase transition ? * the model that we studied here is assumed to describe the robust features from the non - equilibrium dynamics of a charged sector coupled to a ( hyper ) charge gauge field .",
    "gut s or susy theories may provide the corresponding framework .",
    "however we now argue that precisely the model studied here can actually describe the non - equilibrium dynamics _",
    "after _ the qcd phase transition(s ) .",
    "after hadronization and chiral symmetry breaking most of the hadrons produced will be pions , at least this is the experimental situation in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions . neglecting the charge form factor ( which is justified for momenta much smaller than the @xmath557 meson mass @xmath558 ) the charged pions couple to the electromagnetic field with minimal coupling .",
    "the chiral transition is conjectured to be in the same universality class as the @xmath559 linear sigma model@xcite .",
    "thus the model presented in this article , is the _ low energy effective field theory _ for the triplet of pions , two charged and one neutral .    thus we conjecture that the study in this article can be applied to the study of the generation of magnetic fields by long - wavelength pions .",
    "therefore the analysis of this article can apply to magnetogenesis during the _ chiral _ phase transition in qcd . while the charged pions couple to electromagnetism via the minimal coupling in the long - wavelength limit , the neutral pion couples to the electromagnetic field through the chiral anomaly @xmath560 and such process will also produce magnetic fields .",
    "then if the chiral phase transition is second order , it will occur in lte",
    ". however if it is first order as suggested by the fact that the pions are massive , then non - equilibrium effects may arise and primordial magnetic fields may be generated by charged pion bremsstrahlung or pair annihilation or by neutral pion decay .",
