    "we see that the classical phase diagram has the same structure as the u(1)-invariant model , @xcite but the interpretation of the phases are different .",
    "the conventional superfluid phase is replaced with an easy - axis ferromagnetic ordered phase resulting from the spontaneously broken @xmath1 symmetry along the @xmath13-axis .",
    "this phase is predominant in the limit @xmath34 , @xmath61 . as the magnetic field",

    "we have performed spin wave theory of eq .   using the standard approach ( see the appendix).@xcite the crucial feature of the hamiltonian , eq .  , is that the average spin - deviation operator @xmath68 is much smaller than the u(1)-invariant model .",
    "as we shall see in the subsequent sections , the physical reason behind this is because the excitation spectra of eq .",
    "are gapped in the entire brillouin zone , with a maximum contribution from the @xmath71 mode . as a result",

    "since @xmath72 , the smallness of this quantity comes from the @xmath71 mode .",
