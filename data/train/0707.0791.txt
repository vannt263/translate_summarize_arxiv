    "the physical properties of interacting disordered materials are often qualitatively different from their noninteracting counterparts .",
    "for example , it has long been known that noninteracting quasiparticles in two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials are localized by arbitrarily weak disorder ; however , there is evidence that interactions can drive an insulator - metal transition in 2d.@xcite similarly , there is a growing awareness that disorder can fundamentally alter the physical properties of interacting systems .",
    "this arises in a number of transition - metal oxides,@xcite where the predominantly d - orbital character of the conduction electrons results in a large intra - orbital ( on - site ) coulomb interaction relative to the bandwidth .",
    "these materials are of interest because they have an interaction - driven insulating ( mott - insulating ) phase and because of the variety of exotic phases , such as high temperature superconductivity , which appear near half - filling .",
    "however , transition metal oxides are typically doped by chemical substitution and , with few exceptions , are intrinsically disordered . at present , there is little consensus on the effects of this disorder , particularly near the transition to the mott - insulating phase .    here , we discuss the effects of strong electronic correlations on disordered two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials via a numerical study of the anderson - hubbard model , @xmath0 where @xmath1 refers to nearest neighbor lattice sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the spin index , and @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the local charge density operator .",
    "the model has four parameters : the kinetic energy @xmath7 , the intra - orbital coulomb interaction @xmath8 , the width @xmath9 of the disorder - potential distribution , and the chemical potential @xmath10 .",
    "disorder is introduced through randomly chosen site energies @xmath11 , which in this work are box - distributed according to @xmath12 .    for @xmath13",
    ", it is well understood that the single - particle eigenstates of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) are anderson localized for @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the critical disorder and @xmath16 in two and fewer dimensions . for @xmath17 , and at half - filling ( ie .",
    "@xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the charge density ) , there is a critical interaction strength @xmath20 such that the model is a gapped mott insulator for @xmath21 and ( neglecting possible broken - symmetry phases ) a strongly - correlated metal for @xmath22 or for @xmath23 .",
    "there is evidence that the mott transition is fundamentally different in the presence of disorder .",
    "for example , some work has shown that @xmath24 in clean low - dimensional systems with nested fermi surfaces,@xcite while in the disordered case @xmath20 is not only nonzero , but rapidly becomes of order the bandwidth as a function of @xmath9.@xcite in fact , it has become clear through numerous studies that the general @xmath8-@xmath9-@xmath19 phase diagram is complicated and also potentially contains superconducting , antiferromagnetic , and spin glass phases.@xcite much of the recent progress has been for infinite - dimensional systems@xcite and the applicability of this work to two and three dimensions is not well established .",
    "a recent focus has been the extent to which interactions screen the disorder potential@xcite and whether screening may lead to an insulator - metal transition.@xcite in particular , some calculations show perfect screening near the mott transition.@xcite    part of the confusion surrounding the anderson - hubbard phase diagram stems from the variety of theoretical approaches that have been applied .",
    "self - consistent hartree - fock ( hf ) calculations@xcite treat the disorder potential exactly but do not capture the strong - correlation physics of the mott transition .",
    "dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) approaches contain the necessary strong - correlation physics but are based on a local approximation that generally precludes exact treatment of disorder .",
    "a variety of coherent - potential - approximation ( cpa ) and cpa - like approximations have been employed in conjunction with dmft.@xcite while the cpa reproduces some disorder - averaged quantities accurately , eg .  the density of states ( dos ) in the noninteracting limit",
    ", it fails to reproduce quantities that depend on explicit knowledge of spatial correlations between lattice sites . as a notable example , the cpa fails to predict the altshuler - aronov dos anomaly which appears at the fermi energy in disordered metals.@xcite quantum monte carlo@xcite and exact diagonalization@xcite ( ed ) methods treat both disorder and interactions exactly , but suffer from severe finite - size limitations , typically generate only equal - time correlations , and ( in the case of quantum monte carlo ) suffer from the fermion sign problem .    in this work",
    ", we use an extension of dmft , known as statistical dmft,@xcite that incorporates both strong correlations and an exact treatment of the disorder potential . by varying @xmath8 for a fixed disorder strength , we are able to move smoothly from the well - understood weakly - correlated regime into the unknown territory of strongly - correlated disordered systems . because our approach retains spatial correlations between the local self - energy at different lattice sites , but can also be applied to reasonably large lattices in finite dimensions , it provides a bridge between the various methods described above . up to now , statistical dmft has been applied only on a bethe lattice . here",
    ", we work with a two - dimensional square lattice and present results for the density of states , scaling of the inverse participation ratio , and the screened potential .",
    "we focus on paramagnetic solutions on the 2d square lattice , for which the noninteracting bandwidth is @xmath25 . on an @xmath26-site lattice",
    ", the single - particle green s function can be expressed as an @xmath27 matrix in the site - index : @xmath28^{-1 } \\label{g}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 the identity matrix , @xmath30 the matrix of hopping amplitudes , @xmath31 the diagonal matrix of site energies @xmath11 and @xmath32 the matrix of self - energies .",
    "the matrix @xmath30 has nonzero matrix elements @xmath33 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 corresponding to nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "we assume that @xmath32 is local , having only diagonal matrix elements @xmath34 .",

    "for each site @xmath2 , one defines a weiss mean field @xmath36^{-1}$ ] where @xmath37 are the matrix elements of @xmath35 . as in the conventional dmft ,",
    "one then solves for the full green s function @xmath38 of an anderson impurity whose noninteracting green s function is @xmath39 .",
    "the self - energy is then updated according to @xmath40 and the iteration cycle is restarted . in the disorder - free case , this algorithm reduces to the conventional dmft .",
    "we have used the hubbard - i ( hi ) approximation as a solver for @xmath41 , for which , in the paramagnetic case , @xmath42^{-1}$ ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is self - consistently determined for each site .",
    "the hi approximation is the simplest improvement over hartree - fock ( hf ) that generates both upper and lower hubbard bands .",
    "when either the hf or hi approximations are used as a solver , the dmft result is in fact equivalent to the result obtained directly from the corresponding approximation .",
    "however , the statistical - dmft procedure outlined above , applied to a physical lattice , and hence implemented through a matrix inversion [ eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) ] , is very computationally intensive .",
    "in particular , it can be difficult to achieve a converged self - consistent solution to the @xmath26 coupled equations for @xmath34 .",
    "this work , aside from being a simple improvement beyond hf , represents an important proof of principle regarding the feasibility of this statistical dmft approach .",
    "the fact that we are studying disordered systems bears on two important and related issues : ( i ) the accuracy of the hi approximation and ( ii ) the validity of single - site ( as opposed to cluster or cellular ) dmft in a finite dimensional system .",
    "the strengths and weaknesses of the hi approximation are well documented in the clean limit : it is exact in the atomic limit ( @xmath45 ) but is nonconserving and fails to satisfy luttinger s",
    "theorem.@xcite however , it is uniquely effective in low - dimensional disordered systems because @xmath46 corresponds to the atomic limit for arbitrary @xmath8 in systems with finite coordination number .",
    "this is in apparent contradiction to the general result that dmft is only exact in infinite dimensions , while nonlocal terms in the self - energy , neglected in dmft , can have a dramatic effect on the mott transition in 2d.@xcite in the disordered case , however , we have compared our results with ed studies on small clusters@xcite and have found qualitative agreement for @xmath47 ( ie .",

    "there is a transition from a single band to a gapped mott - insulating state at a critical interaction @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , the ldos [ figs .  [",
    "fig : dos](e)-(g ) ] develops a local mott gap at much smaller values of @xmath8 .",
    "we note that , at most sites , the noninteracting ldos has a single strong resonance near the bare site energy [ fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](e ) ] indicating proximity to the atomic limit where hi becomes exact .",
    "the coordination number of the lattice determines the disorder strength required to approach the atomic limit . in lattices with infinite coordination number , each site couples to a continuum of states and the atomic limit is never reached for finite @xmath9 .",
    "thus , somewhat paradoxically , dmft with the hi solver works best , in disordered systems , for lattices with low coordination number .",
    "it is useful to compare the dos evolution in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] with existing published work .",
    "first , we note that the mott transition occurs at @xmath54 in both our dmft and ed calculations .",
    "this is consistent with qmc results for three dimensions,@xcite as well as infinite - dimensional dmft results,@xcite but @xmath20 is somewhat larger than found in one dimension.@xcite our @xmath20 is also significantly larger than in unrestricted hf calculations for three dimensions;@xcite however , in hf calculations , the metal - insulator transition is of the slater - type and could therefore be expected to respond differently to disorder .",
    "previously published results for the dos near the mott transition in the large - disorder limit , to our knowledge , are for infinite dimensions where cpa - like approximations can be made .",
    "the main distinction between our results and those for infinite - dimensions is the quasiparticle resonance due to kondo screening of the local moments that appears at the fermi energy for @xmath55 in the latter case.@xcite ( the peak at @xmath56 for @xmath57 comes from the overlap of the lower and upper hubbard bands . )",
    "the hi solver can not give such a peak ; however , ed calculations for small clusters@xcite also find no resonance at any @xmath8 .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ fig : dos](c ) shows ed results for parameters corresponding to a maximum quasiparticle resonance height in refs .",
    ". the difference between our results and those for infinite - dimensions might seem unsurprising since there is also no resonance in the clean limit in 2d.@xcite however , the reason for this absence appears to be different in the clean and disordered systems .",
    "the lack of a quasiparticle resonance in clean 2d systems has been attributed to nonlocal terms in the self - energy,@xcite terms which are not included in hi .",
    "these nonlocal terms describe short - ranged antiferromagnetic correlations whose effect is to suppress @xmath20 to zero in the clean limit.@xcite in our work , the absence of a quasiparticle peak stems from the calculations being in the atomic limit . that the same physics controls the ed results is supported by the fact that @xmath20 is nearly identical in hi and ed calculations .",
    "it therefore appears as if the limitations of the hi solver do not hide key physics in the large disorder limit .    the dos at quarter - filling , fig .  [",
    "fig : dos](d ) , _ does _ have a peak at the fermi energy , but the origin of this peak is unrelated to strong correlations .",

    "this altshuler - aronov dos anomaly is absent at half - filling in our calculations , in contradiction with the hf calculations , indicating that strong correlations suppress the peak .",
