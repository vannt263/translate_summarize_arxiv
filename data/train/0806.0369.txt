    "the quantum radiative corrections to the mass of the solitons have been of great interest since the 1970 s , and has had a long , complicated , and at times controversial history . in 1974 ,",
    "dashen _ et .",
    "al _ ( dhn)@xcite computed the one - loop correction to the mass of the bosonic kink in @xmath0 field theory for the first time . in that article they used the mode number cutoff method with a continuous form for the phase shifts of the scattering states .",
    "after dhn , several other authors have used similar methods to compute quantum corrections for analogous problems @xcite . ever since dhn s work , several other methods have been invented or used for analogous problems , the most important five of which are the following .",
    "first is the energy momentum cutoff using discontinuous form of the scattering states phase shifts @xcite .",
    "the above two approaches have sparked remarkable controversies @xcite .",
    "second is the derivative expansion of the effective action using summation of the series for the exactly solvable cases , which embeds an analytic continuation , or pad approximation or borel summation formula for the approximately solvable cases @xcite .",
    "third is the scattering phase shift method in which the change in the density of states due to the presence of the disturbance is represented by the scattering phase shifts @xcite .",
    "fourth is the dimensional regularization technique in which the zero point energy of the free vacuum is subtracted and dimensional regularization is used @xcite .",
    "fifth is the zeta function regularization technique which completely bypasses the explicit subtraction of free vacuum energy @xcite .",
    "obviously all these methods have eventually confirmed the dhn result . as a side note",
    "we should mention that analogous corrections to the mass of the bosonic kink have been computed in supersymmetric models ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the main issue that we discussed in previous papers @xcite is that the presence of nontrivial boundary conditions or strong nontrivial ( position dependent ) backgrounds such as solitons , which could also affect the boundary conditions , are in principle nonperturbative effects .",
    "therefore they define the overall structure and the properties of the theory and obviously can not be ignored or even taken into account perturbatively .",
    "we believe that the renormalization program should be self - contained , and automatically take into account the aforementioned conditions in a self - consistent manner .",
    "note that , the presence of either nontrivial boundary conditions or nontrivial backgrounds or both break the translational symmetry of the system .",
    "obviously the breaking of the translational symmetry has many manifestations .",
    "most importantly all the _ n_-point functions of the theory will have in general nontrivial position dependence in the coordinate representation .",
    "the procedure to deduce the counterterms from the _ n_-point functions in a renormalized perturbation theory is standard and has been available for over half a century .",
    "this , as we have shown , could lead to a set of uniquely defined position dependent counterterms . therefore , the radiative corrections to all the input parameters of the theory , could be in general position dependent .",
    "we have used this program to compute the one - loop radiative correction to the casimir effect within @xmath0 theory @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the implications of this proposed renormalization program @xcite , as applied to the computation of the one - loop radiative correction to the mass of the @xmath0 kink in 1 + 1 dimensions .",
    "this problem is analogous to the casimir problem with the kink as its static background .",
    "we choose the kink as our example because it has simultaneously two nontrivial properties which are its spatial dependence and boundary conditions .",
    "it is worth mentioning that for this category of problems , in all the papers that we are aware of , the authors use free counterterms , by which we mean the ones derived for the free case , i.e. cases with no nontrivial boundary conditions or spatial backgrounds .",
    "we use the counterterm obtained through our renormalization procedure @xcite .",
    "the difference between our position dependent counterterm and the position independent free one , turns out to be small terms proportional to the lowest lying localized state distributions .",
    "this difference , depicted in @xcite , will lead to a small difference between our result and the previously reported one @xcite .",
    "our method can be compared with the mean field approach applied to this problem @xcite .",
    "we have organized the paper in four sections as follows . in section [ sec.2 ]",
    "we set up the usual problem of @xmath0 theory for a real scalar field in 1 + 1 dimensions , in the spontaneously broken phase .",
    "we find the static background solutions which include the trivial and the kink sectors .",
    "we also exhibit the quantum fluctuations in both sectors , the latter of which includes two normalized states : one zero mode state reflecting the invariance of the system under translation of the kink and the other a true bound state .",
    "then in section [ sec3 ] we calculate the one - loop radiative correction to the kink mass by subtracting the vacuum energies of the two sectors .",
    "the part of this energy which dose not depend on the counterterms is calculated using the mode number cutoff .",
    "we then calculate the contribution from the mass counterterms .",
    "when we add up all the contributions , we find an extra term which is due to the nontrivial counterterm in the kink sector .",
    "finally in section [ sec4 ] we compare our methods and results to some earlier work , and conjecture on some possible implications of our method .",
    "in this section we shall very briefly state the standard results for the static background solutions and their quantum fluctuations for the bosonic @xmath0 theory . for a comprehensive review of the standard materials",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "we start with the lagrangian density for a neutral massive scalar field , within @xmath0 theory , appropriate for the spontaneously broken symmetry phase in 1 + 1 dimensions : @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2=\\frac{\\lambda _ 0}{4}\\left ( \\phi^2 - \\frac{\\mu _ 0 ^ 2}{\\lambda_0 } \\right)^2 $ ] . the euler - lagrange equation can be easily obtained and is a second - order nonlinear pde with the following lowest lying solutions : two non - topological static solutions @xmath3 , and two topological static ones @xmath4 $ ] which are called kink and antikink , respectively .",
    "the presence of @xmath5 indicates the translational invariance , and this will lead to a zero mode .",
    "the total kink energy , sometimes called the classical kink mass is given by @xmath6 . in order to find the quantum corrections to this mass",
    ", we have to make a functional taylor expansion of the potential about the static solutions which yields the stability equation @xmath7\\eta ( x ) = \\omega'^2 \\eta ( x),\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath8 .",
    "the results in the trivial sector are the following continuum states @xmath9 with @xmath10 . in the kink sector",
    "we have the following two bound states and continuum states : @xmath11 ,   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . here",

    "we believe the phase shifts should be in principle defined to be continuous functions of their arguments .",
    "this is particularly apparent in their use in the levinson theorem ( see for example @xcite ) . for this particular case",
    "the phase shift is illustrated in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "a direct calculation of the phase shift yields the graph on the top .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "in this section we calculate the first order quantum correction to the kink mass .",
    "as is well known , this is analogous to the casimir problem for this case .",
    "that is , the exact kink mass is the difference between the vacuum energies in the presence and absence of the kink . to calculate this effect we set up renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "we should mention that in these 1 + 1 dimensional problems , one usually chooses a minimal renormalization scheme defined at all loops by @xcite @xmath22 the sufficiency of these conditions is supported by the fact that for any theory of a scalar field in two dimensions with nonderivative interactions , all divergences that occur in any order of perturbation theory can be removed by normal - ordering the hamiltonian @xcite",
    ". however , relaxing the first condition will lead to some extra finite contributions @xcite . here , for ease of comparison with the previously reported result we use the renormalization program with the above stated conditions but with nontrivial mass counterterm @xmath23 .",
    "now we can split the expression for mass of the kink into the following two parts , @xmath24 where the first part is in the vacuum sector of each , and the second part is due to the counterterms .",
    "we put our solutions in a box of length @xmath25 and impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the continuum limit is reached by taking @xmath25 to infinity and the sum turns into an integral .",
    "now we use the usual mode number cutoff as advocated by dhn @xcite to calculate the first part of eq .",
    "( [ casimir ] ) . in this method",
    "one subtracts the energies of the bound states in the presence of solitons from the same number of lowest lying quasi - continuum states in the vacuum of the trivial sector .",
    "then one subtracts the remaining quasi - continuum states from each other in ascending order . in this case",
    "our two lowest lying states are the aforementioned two normalizable states which are to be subtracted from @xmath26 .",
    "then we subtract the quasi - continuum @xmath27 from the remaining @xmath28 one by one .",
    "the periodic boundary condition implies , @xmath29 the first part of eq .",
    "( [ casimir ] ) can be easily calculated as follows @xmath30\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{-.2cm}=\\frac{m^3}{3\\lambda}+ \\frac{{\\sqrt3 m}}{4}- m + \\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^n{\\left[{m(\\frac{q_n ^2}{4}+ 1)^{\\frac{1}{2}}-(k_{n+1}^2 + m^2)^{\\frac{1}2}}\\right]}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hspace{-.2cm}\\to \\frac{m^3}{3\\lambda}+ \\frac{{\\sqrt 3 m}}{{4 } } - \\frac{{3 m } } { 2\\pi } - \\frac{{3 m}}{{4\\pi } } \\dd \\int _ { - \\infty } ^\\infty    { \\frac{{k^2   + m^2/2 } } { { \\sqrt { k^2   + m^2 } ( k^2   + \\frac{{m^2 } } { 4 } ) } } }    dk,\\nonumber\\\\\\label{17}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the last step we have taken the continuum limit , performed an integration by parts taking the appropriate boundary values of the phase shift into account , as explained earlier .",

    "now we calculate the second part of eq .",
    "( [ casimir ] ) : @xmath31},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the mass counterterms in the kink and vacuum backgrounds , respectively , and are calculated below .",
    "we first start with the mass counterterms in vacuum background . the procedure for obtaining this quantity",
    "is well known , e.g. by setting the tadpole equal to zero @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath34 which is logarithmically divergent .",
    "the appropriate mass counterterm in the kink background is @xcite , @xmath35 which , as expected earlier , is different from mass counterterm in the trivial sector , i.e. the last term in eq .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) .",
    "in fact it has extra finite @xmath36-dependent terms due to the presence of the bound states , and obviously this difference tends to zero as @xmath37 , since the kink solution also tends to either of the trivial vacuum states in this limit .",
    "however , note that introducing an @xmath36-dependent counterterm into the lagrangian dose not introduce any unaccounted - for interactions to the system , since eq .",
    "( [ ren . ] ) is always valid . to complete the calculation",
    "we need to calculate eq .",

    "( [ 34 ] ) which is small .",
    "in this paper we have calculated the one - loop radiative correction to the mass of the kink using an alternative renormalization approach , and have compared it with the previously reported value .",
    "it has been argued that the presence of a kink has nonperturbative effects , and once its position is fixed the translational symmetry of the system is broken and this has profound consequences .",
    "therefore these properties define the overall structure of the theory and obviously can not be taken into account perturbatively .",
    "in particular all of the _ n_-point functions of the theory , the counterterms , and the renormalized parameters of the theory could in general become position dependent . in particular in eq .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) the difference between @xmath44 and @xmath39 is shown explicitly .",
    "this has led to a small difference between the result obtained by this renormalization program and the perviously reported value .",
