    "spherically symmetric self - similar perfect fluid spacetimes have attracted considerable attention during the last couple of decades ( see e.g. , @xcite for references ) .",
    "this is not surprising since they lead to ordinary differential equations while still providing an arena for a number of interesting physical phenomena : shock waves @xcite ; self - similar perturbations of the flat friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) solution , which are of relevance for the growth of primordial black holes and evolution of voids ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; and violation of cosmic censorship @xcite , are some examples .",
    "these models also have broader implications .",
    "for example , they have turned out to be of essential importance when it comes to understanding spherically symmetric black hole formation @xcite .",
    "self - similar spherically symmetric perfect - fluid models exhibit several preferred geometric structures .",
    "there are preferred directions associated with the 4-velocity of the fluid and the homothetic killing vector ( with self - similar spacetimes here we mean spacetimes with a homothetic killing vector . for a discussion about self - similarity , see @xcite ) .",
    "another preferred structure is the area of the spherical symmetry surfaces .",
    "these three structures have led to three approaches , each using a specific coordinate gauge .",
    "the first is ` the comoving perfect - fluid approach ' initiated by cahill and taub @xcite .",
    "the second is ` the homothetic approach ' used by bogoyavlensky and co - workers @xcite .",
    "the third is ` the schwarzschild approach ' used by , for example , ori and piran ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "each gauge suggests more or less natural variables and each gauge has its individual physical interpretational advantages .",
    "thus they are all complementary .",
    "however , it is possible to express many features gauge invariantly .",
    "this makes it possible to algebraically relate the variables one has used in the various approaches ( this will be done in [ sec : coord ] ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that apart from the above three approaches there are also some other approaches , useful for studying the spacetime structure ` near ' singularities and for investigating global spacetime features , based on synchronous coordinate systems @xcite and null coordinates @xcite .",
    "we will use the homothetic approach as our starting point .",
    "the homothetic approach has the advantage that it reveals a considerable structural similarity between the field equations for the self - similar spherically symmetric models and the hypersurface homogeneous models ( e.g. spatially homogeneous ( sh ) models ) .",
    "there is a considerable literature about how one can treat the field equations of the hypersurface homogeneous models .",
    "thus the homothetic approach makes it possible to transfer ideas from the hypersurface homogeneous arena to the present situation .",
    "however , the homothetic approach , where one chooses a coordinate along the orbits of the homothetic killing vector ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , has a disadvantage . in general , the symmetry surface changes causality .",
    "if one uses a homothetic diagonal gauge for the spherically symmetric case , then the spacetime must be covered with several coordinate patches ; one for the region where the homothetic killing vector is spacelike and one where it is timelike .",
    "then one has to join the regions where the homothetic killing vector is null .",
    "this is the first paper in a series with the aim of obtaining a global picture of the space of solutions for self - similar spherically symmetric perfect - fluid models . here",
    "we will consider the case where the homothetic killing vector is spacelike ; the so - called spatially self - similar ( sss ) spherically symmetric models .",
    "these models are characterized by a four - dimensional homothetic symmetry group acting multiply transitively on three - dimensional spatial surfaces . in a subsequent paper @xcite we will deal with the timelike self - similar ( tss ) spherically symmetric perfect - fluid models , i.e. the models where the homothetic killing vector is timelike .",
    "most of the physically interesting phenomena , e.g. shock waves , are actually associated with the tss region , and consequently it is not surprising that most previous work has focused on this region . however , to obtain a global understanding one also needs to consider the spatial region . in a third paper",
    "we will address the specific problem of matching solutions between the two regions as well as focusing more on physical properties of the space of solutions .",
    "therefore the mathematical nature of the present paper is justified as the results are needed in the subsequent studies .",
    "however , one physically interesting property pertaining to the sss region , density perturbations of the flat flrw solution , is treated in the present paper .    by using the homothetic approach and ideas from hypersurface homogeneous models",
    "we will reformulate einstein s field equations so that the dynamics takes place in a reduced and compact phase space ; one system for the spacelike case and one for the timelike case .",
    "moreover , it will turn out that in our formulation , all equilibrium points ( critical points , singular points , fixed points ) are hyperbolic ( here we also include the case of a line of equilibrium points where there is one zero eigenvalue corresponding to the line ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast to earlier treatments where noncompact variables have been used and where certain parts of phase space have been ` crushed ' . to deal with these problems ,",
    "one has made numerous variable changes and special treatments of various parts of phase space ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this has resulted in an incomplete , or even misleading , picture of the global solution structure .",
    "the line element for sss spherically symmetric models , written in diagonal form where one of the coordinates is adapted to the homothetic symmetry , takes the form @xcite @xmath0 .\\ ] ]    we will consider perfect fluid models .",
    "the energy momentum tensor , @xmath1 , is thus given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the energy density , @xmath4 is the pressure and @xmath5 the 4-velocity of the fluid .",
    "we will assume @xmath6 as an equation of state , where the parameter @xmath7 takes values in the interval @xmath8 which include radiation ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "consequently , we have excluded dust ( @xmath10 ) and stiff fluids ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "these models behave quite differently compared to those in the above interval , and thus need special treatment .",
    "the dust solutions are known explicitly ( these models are just special cases of the general spherically symmetric dust solutions , which are all known explicitly , see e.g. , @xcite ) .    the outline of the paper is the following . in section 2",
    "einstein s field equations are rewritten in terms of a dimensionless set of variables in order to obtain a maximal reduction of the coupled system of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the variables are chosen so that they take values in a compact phase space . in section 3",
    "the equations are subsequently analysed by means of methods from the theory of dynamical systems . in section 4",
    "a numerical investigation is undertaken and global dynamical features are considered .",
    "we end with a discussion in section 5 .",
    "appendix a describes the properties of the fluid congruence , the condition for the spacetimes to belong to petrov type 0 and also some expressions relevant for the mass function and density perturbations .",
    "appendix b gives the relation between various coordinates and the relation between the present variables and other variables used in the literature .",
    "following @xcite we introduce @xmath12 where the dot denotes @xmath13 . the quantities",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 describe the kinematical properties of the normal congruence of the symmetry surfaces in the @xmath16 spacetime that is conformally related to the physical spacetime @xmath17 with the homothetic factor ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) ; @xmath14 is the expansion while @xmath15 describes the shear . the orthonormal frame components , in @xmath16 , of the fluid velocity are conveniently parametrized by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is just the 3-velocity with respect to the symmetry surfaces .",
