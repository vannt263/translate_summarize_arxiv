    "the experimental fact that all objects fall with the same acceleration is known as the weak equivalence principle @xcite .",
    "the first systematic tests of the universality of free fall were done by galileo @xcite , who measured the acceleration of freely falling objects , or of objects rolling down an inclined plane .",
    "such an approach suffers from great inaccuracies , which are related to the short time scales involved .",
    "indeed , galileo was unable to accurately determine @xmath0 , the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the earth , due to the lack of an accurate clock .",
    "galileo concluded that a much better way to check the universality of free fall was to use a pendulum .",
    "newton , and following him others , improved on galileo s experiments , and were able to determine @xmath0 quite accurately .",
    "( notice that it is much harder to measure @xmath0 than it is to test the weak equivalence principle . ) because the period is cumulative , by measuring the time over many cycles of the pendulum one can increase the accuracy in the measurement of @xmath0 significantly .",
    "is the value of the gravitational acceleration as determined by free - fall experiments identical to the value of the gravitational acceleration as determined by the period of a pendulum ? in this paper we shall study this question , and show that the spherical geometry of the earth affects the _ effective _ gravitational acceleration differently in the two types of experiments : the effective gravitational acceleration is greater than @xmath0 for pendulum experiments , and smaller than @xmath0 for free - fall experiments .",
    "the approximation that both galileo and newton used ( and which is also used in virtually all physics textbooks from the high school level to the advanced undergraduate level @xcite ) , is to make the following two assumptions on the earth s gravitational field .",
    "first , one assumes that the gravitational acceleration is independent of the altitude above the surface of the earth .",
    "that is , one assumes that during its motion , a freely falling object or the pendulum s bob experiences a constant acceleration due to gravity , such that the variation of the gravitational acceleration with altitude ( `` vertical inhomogeneities '' of the gravitational field ) is neglected .",
    "second , for the case of a pendulum , one assumes that the gravitational field lines are parallel .",
    "that is , one neglects the variations in the direction of the gravitational field ( `` lateral inhomogeneities '' of the gravitational field ) which come about because the gravitational field lines direct towards the center of the earth . effectively , this latter approximation amount to adopting a model for the earth wherein the earth is flat .",
    "we shall dubb this latter approximation henceforth as the `` flat earth '' ( fe ) approximation .",
    "the former approximation , when taken in tandem with the fe approximation , is equivalent to assuming that the flat earth extends indefinitely is all directions . as in usual pendulum experiments both assumptions",
    "are regularly made , we shall refer by the fe approximation to both assumptions taken together .",
    "it turns out that the values of the gravitational acceleration as determined by free fall or by using a pendulum are not identical if one uses the flat earth approximation ( even without neglecting the vertical inhomogeneities ) . specifically , the finite size of the spherical earth acts in opposite ways : it effectively _ decreases _ the gravitational acceleration in free fall experiments , and effectively _ increases _ the gravitational acceleration in pendulum experiments . under most circumstances ,",
    "the deviations of the effective gravitational acceleration from @xmath0 due to the spherical earth are tiny : the relative change in @xmath0 is of order of the ratio of the length of the arm of the pendulum to the radius of the earth . for short pendula ,",
    "the systematic error involved in neglecting this effect is smaller than the systematic errors in the neglections of other effects , notably the finite amplitude effect , the mass of the wire which suspends the bob , the finite size of the bob , decay of finite amplitudes , or the buoyancy effect @xcite .",
    "nelson and olsson @xcite listed many systematics , and included many sources for error which affect the measurement of @xmath0 with a pendulum only minutely .",
    "even with a wire of moderate length ( nelson and olsson used a wire whose length was 3 m ) , the fe approximation is responsible for a systematic error which is considerably larger than some of the systematics which nelson and olsson did discuss . with longer arm ,",
    "the spherical earth effect becomes even more important .",
    "as we shall see , for pendula of lengths comparable with the usual length of the foucault pendulum , the spherical earth effect is comparable to the finite amplitude effect . and",
    "yet , the effect of the spherical earth is usually neglected in most treatments .",
    "the spherical earth effect was treated briefly by gough @xcite , who assumed an infinitely small amplitude .",
    "it turns out , however , that the spherical earth effect couples with finite amplitudes in a rather complicated manner .    in this paper",
    "we shall consider the effect of a spherical earth on the period of a simple pendulum , and show that this effect acts to shorten the period .",
    "that is , when one uses the fe model and fits experimental data to the parameters of that model , one gets a value for the gravitational acceleration which is slightly higher than the actual one . as the fe approximation is used so frequently at all level of instruction ( from the high school level to the advanced undergraduate level ) , it is instructive to understand the nature of the fe approximation .",
    "in addition , the analysis in the paper is appropriate for classroom instruction or as a homework assignment at the intermediate or advanced undergraduate levels .",
    "consider a simple pendulum of arm length @xmath1 , which moves under the earth s gravity , in the absence of any non - gravitational forces ( such as friction ) .",
    "we assume that the pendulum moves in a perfect vacuum , is suspended from a perfectly rigid support by an inextensible massless string , and that the bob is a point .",
    "we further assume that the earth is perfectly spherical .",
    "the radius of the earth is @xmath2 , and its mass is @xmath3 . at the surface of the earth",
    "the gravitational acceleration then is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is newton s constant .",
    "the opening angle of the pendulum is @xmath6 .",
    "( see figure [ fig1 ] . )",
    "we assume that the arm of the pendulum is extensionless and weightless , such that the entire mass of the pendulum @xmath7 is in the bob . denoting by @xmath8 the distance of the bob from the center of the earth , we find that @xmath9 .",
    "the energy per unit mass @xmath10 of the bob is @xmath11 where an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time . denoting @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath13 conservation of energy implies that @xmath10 equals at all times its value at the turning point of the motion , where @xmath6 equals its maximum value @xmath14 . at the turning point",
    "@xmath15 , such that @xmath16    epsf    7.0 cm    define next @xmath17 , and find that @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "notice that for small values of @xmath20 , @xmath21 is at order @xmath20 .",
    "the period of the motion @xmath22 is given by @xmath23    this integral can be evaluated numerically .",
    "however , we can gain much insight into it by approximating the integrand .",
    "as @xmath24 , we can expand the expression inside the brackets as @xmath25 neglecting terms which are at order @xmath26 .",
    "then , to that order , we find that @xmath27    the integral is the usual complete elliptic integral ( see appendix [ appa ] ) @xcite , such that @xmath28 recall that this result is accurate only to @xmath29 .",
    "we write in eq .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) the result in terms of the elliptic integral just for easy notation and comparison with the usual result of the fe model . in the limit of @xmath30",
    "( radius of the earth goes to infinity ,  flat earth model \" ) , we recover the regular result for the period of a simple pendulum , i.e. , @xmath31 . for finite values of @xmath20 , however , we find that the result can be expressed through an effective gravitational acceleration @xmath32 , which means that effectively gravity for a pendulum is enhanced in the spherical earth compared with the flat earth model .",
    "consequently , we find that the period of a pendulum when the spherical earth is taken into consideration is shorter than in the flat earth model .",
    "specifically @xmath33    we can also write the solution including higher - order corrections in @xmath20 . in this case",
    "one can no longer write the solution easily in closed form . instead",
    ", one can write it as a series expansion as @xmath34 \\ , . \\label{e9}\\ ] ] notice that the period in eq .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) separated into a product of a function of @xmath20 and a function of @xmath35 .",
    "this happened just because of the small @xmath36 approximation we made .",
    "in general , the period is not separable , as is clear from eq .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) . as the elliptic function @xmath37 , in the limit of @xmath30 eq .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) indeed agrees with eq .",
    "( [ e8 ] ) .",
    "notice that the usual effect of finite amplitude is to lengthen the period of the pendulum .",
    "the effect of the spherical earth is in the opposite direction : it shortens the period .",
    "this shortening of the period comes about because effectively the gravitational acceleration is enhanced compared with its value at the surface of the earth . to understand this heuristically ,",
    "consider the forces which act on the bob .",
    "because the bob is at height @xmath38 above the surface of the earth , the gravitational acceleration there is given by @xmath39 . because the weight of the bob directs towards the center of the earth ,",
    "its angle with the string of the pendulum is not @xmath6 , but rather @xmath40 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the definitions of the geometrical quantities . )",
    "consequently , the projection of the bob s weight perpendicularly to the pendulum s arm , which is the force @xmath41 which determines the torque which drives the oscillations , is given by @xmath42 simple geometrical considerations show that @xmath43 , and @xmath44 .",
    "expanding @xmath41 in small @xmath45 , and keeping only the leading terms in @xmath46 and @xmath45 , we find that @xmath47 this has the same form as the force which acts on the bob in the flat earth model , but with a slightly enhanced gravitational acceleration .",
    "gravity being effectively stronger , it is clear why the period of the pendulum s oscillations shortens .",
    "as the period of the pendulum is inversely proportional to the square root of the gravitational acceleration , we immediately recover eq .",
    "( [ period ] ) .    in the flat earth model",
    "we effectively take the limit as @xmath48 .",
    "this implies that when we compute the gravitational acceleration using a pendulum , we in fact measure @xmath49 , not @xmath0 , that is , we measure a slightly larger acceleration .",
    "of course , with reasonable length for the pendulum , this effect is smaller than typical experimental errors . compare this with the gravitational acceleration which we measure using a free - fall experiment ( or an inclined surface ) .",
    "the gravitational acceleration decreases with height , such that at all times it is slightly smaller than @xmath0 at the earth s surface .",
    "specifically , the gravitational acceleration is given by @xmath50 .",
    "when we use the flat earth ( with infinite extension ) model , we in fact neglect this small variation in the gravitational acceleration .",
    "that is , when measuring the gravitational acceleration using a free fall experiment , we are in effect measuring @xmath50 , not @xmath0 .",
    "notice that @xmath51 , whereas @xmath52 .",
    "that is , when we use the flat earth model we measure different quantities for the gravitational acceleration when we do a pendulum experiment or a free fall experiment .",
    "the fractional change in the pendulum s period being at order @xmath45 implies that this effect is very small under most circumstances .",
    "as @xmath53 m , even if we take a long pendulum , of length @xmath54 m , the change in the period would be just one part in @xmath55 .",
    "this effect , which is typically ignored in textbooks , however , can be at the same order of magnitude as other effects , which many standard textbooks do discuss @xcite .",
    "specifically , one can choose reasonable parameters for which this effect is at the same order as the usual lengthening of the period due to finite amplitude effects .",
    "in fact , because these two effects are competing , one can easily choose parameters for which the spherical earth effect compensates for the finite amplitude effect at leading order , such that dependence on amplitude would be at order @xmath56 ( rather than @xmath57 ) .    comparing the two effects , we find that they are comparable if @xmath58 .",
    "take , say , @xmath59rad",
    ". the two effects are comparable if @xmath60 , or @xmath61 m .",
    "this length is the length of the foucault pendulum in the science museum of virginia , and about the length of many foucault s pendula which are used in many science museums for demonstration of the earth s rotation .",
    "the length of the arc of the pendulum s motion then is about @xmath62 m , which is large enough to be set conveniently .",
    "i thank richard price for stimulating discussions .",
    "this research was supported by the national science foundation through grant no .",
    "in this appendix we show how to bring the integral in eq .",
    "( [ per ] ) to the familiar form of the complete elliptic integral of the first kind .",
    "the strategy is to change the variables such that the interval of integration would be from @xmath63 to @xmath64 .",
    "we choose then a new variable @xmath65 , defined by @xmath66 .",
