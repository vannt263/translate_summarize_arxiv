    "quantum computing has attracted much attention over the last ten to fifteen years , partly because of its promise of super - fast factoring and its potential for the efficient simulation of quantum dynamics .",
    "there are many different architectures for quantum computers based on many different physical systems .",
    "these include atom- and ion - trap quantum computing , superconducting charge and flux qubits , nuclear magnetic resonance , spin- and charge - based quantum dots , nuclear spin quantum computing , and optical quantum computing ( for a recent overview see spiller et al .",
    "all these systems have their own advantages in quantum information processing .",
    "however , even though there may now be a few front - runners , such as ion - trap and superconducting quantum computing , no physical implementation seems to have a clear edge over others at this point .",
    "this is an indication that the technology is still in its infancy .",
    "quantum computing with linear quantum optics , the subject of this review , has the advantage that the smallest unit of quantum information ( the photon ) is potentially free from decoherence : the quantum information stored in a photon tends to stay there .",
    "the downside is that photons do not naturally interact with each other , and in order to apply two - qubit quantum gates such interactions are essential .",
    "therefore , if we are to construct an optical quantum computer , one way or another we have to introduce an effective interaction between photons . in section",
    "[ sec : kerr ] , we review the use of so - called large cross - kerr nonlinearities to induce a single - photon controlled - not operation",
    ". however , naturally occurring nonlinearities of this sort are many orders of magnitude smaller than what is needed for our purposes . an alternative way to induce an effective interaction between photons is to make projective measurements with photo - detectors .",
    "the difficulty with this technique is that such optical quantum gates are probabilistic : more often than not , the gate fails and destroys the information in the quantum computation .",
    "this can be circumvented by using an exponential number of optical modes , but this is by definition not scalable ( see also section [ sec : kerr ] ) . in 2001 ,",
    "knill , laflamme , and milburn ( klm 2001 ) constructed a protocol in which probabilistic two - photon gates are teleported into a quantum circuit with high probability .",
    "subsequent error correction in the quantum circuit is used to bring the error rate down to fault - tolerant levels .",
    "we describe the klm protocol in detail in section [ klm ] .",
    "initially , the klm protocol was designed as a proof that linear optics and projective measurements allow for scalable quantum computing in principle .",
    "however , it subsequently spurred on new experiments in quantum optics , demonstrating the operation of high - fidelity probabilistic two - photon gates . on the theoretical front ,",
    "several improvements of the protocol were proposed , leading to ever smaller overhead cost on the computation .",
    "a number of these improvements are based on _ cluster - state _ quantum computing , or the one - way quantum computer .",
    "recently , a circuit - based model was shown to have similar scaling properties as the best - known cluster state model . in section [ sec : imp ] , we describe the several improvements to linear optical quantum information processing in considerable detail , and in section [ sec : real ] , we describe the issues involved in the use of realistic components such as photon detectors , photon sources and quantum memories .",
    "given these realistic components , we discuss loss tolerance and general error correction for linear optical quantum computing ( loqc ) in section [ sec : error ]",
    ".    we will restrict our discussion to the theory of single - photon implementations of quantum information processors , and we assume some familiarity with the basic concepts of quantum computing . for an introduction to quantum computation and quantum information ,",
    "see e.g. , nielsen and chuang ( 2000 ) . for",
    "a review article on optical quantum information processing with continuous variables , see braunstein and van loock ( 2005 ) . in section [ sec : outlook ]",
    "we conclude with an outlook on other promising optical quantum information processing techniques , such as photonic band - gap structures , weak cross - kerr nonlinearities , and hybrid matter - photon systems .",
    "we start our review with a short introduction to linear optics , @xmath0 port optical interferometers and circuits , and we define the different versions of the optical qubit .",
    "the basic building blocks of linear optics are beam splitters , half- and quarter - wave plates , phase shifters , etc . in this section",
    "we will describe these devices mathematically and establish the convention that is used throughout the rest of the paper .",
    "the quantum - mechanical plane - wave expansion of the electromagnetic vector potential is usually expressed in terms of the annihilation operators @xmath1 and their adjoints , the creation operators : @xmath2 where @xmath3 indexes the polarisation in the coulomb gauge and @xmath4 is the corresponding polarisation vector . for the moment",
    "we suppress the polarisation degree of freedom and consider general properties of the creation and annihilation operators .",
    "they bear their names because they act in a specific way on the fock states @xmath5 : @xmath6 where we suppressed the @xmath7 dependence .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath8 is the number operator @xmath9 for a given mode with momentum @xmath7 .",
    "the canonical commutation relations between @xmath10 and @xmath11 are given by @xmath12 & = & \\delta(k - k ' ) \\cr   \\left[\\hat{a}(k),\\hat{a}(k')\\right ] & = & \\left[\\hat{a}^{\\dagger}(k ) ,   \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}(k')\\right ] = 0\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the rest of this review , we denote the information about the spatial mode , @xmath7 , by a subscript , since we will not be concerned with the geometrical details of the interferometers we describe , only how the spatial modes are connected . also , to avoid notational clutter we will use operator hats only for non - unitary and non - hermitian operators , as well as cases where omission of the hat would lead to confusion .",
    "an important optical component is the single - mode _ phase shift_. it changes the phase of the electromagnetic field in a given mode : @xmath13 with the interaction hamiltonian @xmath14 ( here , and throughout this review , we use the convention that @xmath15 , and the time dependence is absorbed in @xmath16 ) .",
    "this hamiltonian is proportional to the number operator , which means that the photon number is conserved .",
    "physically , a phase shifter is a slab of transparent material with an index of refraction that is different from that of free space .",
    "another important component is the _ beam splitter _ ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bs ] ) .",
    "physically , it consists of a semi - reflective mirror : when light falls on this mirror , part will be reflected and part will be transmitted .",
    "the theory of the lossless beam splitter is central to loqc , and was developed by zeilinger ( 1981 ) and fearn and loudon ( 1987 ) .",
    "lossy beam splitters were studied by barnett et al .",
    "the transmission and reflection properties of general dielectric media were studied by dowling ( 1998 ) .",
    "let the two incoming modes on either side of the beam splitter be denoted by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and the outgoing modes by @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "when we parameterise the probability amplitudes of these possibilities as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and the relative phase as @xmath23 , then the beam splitter yields an evolution in operator form @xmath24 the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the beam splitter are @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the relative phase shift @xmath29 ensures that the transformation is unitary .",
    "typically , we choose either @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "mathematically , the two parameters @xmath32 and @xmath23 represent the angles of a rotation about two orthogonal axes in the poincar sphere .",
    "the physical beam splitter can be described by any choice of @xmath32 and @xmath23 , provided the correct phase shifts are applied to the outgoing modes .    in general the hamiltonian @xmath33 of the beam splitter evolution in eq .",
    "( [ 2bs ] ) is given by @xmath34 since the operator @xmath33 commutes with the total number operator , @xmath35=0 $ ] , the photon number is conserved in the lossless beam splitter , as one would expect .",
    "the same mathematical description applies to the evolution due to a _ polarisation rotation _",
    ", physically implemented by quarter- and half - wave plates . instead of having two different spatial modes @xmath36 and @xmath37 , the two incoming modes have different polarisations .",
    "we write @xmath38 and @xmath39 for some orthogonal set of coordinates @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( i.e. , @xmath42 ) . the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath23 are now angles of rotation : @xmath43 this evolution has the same hamiltonian as the beam splitter , and it formalises the equivalence between the so - called polarisation and dual - rail logic .",
    "these transformations are sufficient to implement any photonic single - qubit operation @xcite .",
    "the last linear optical element that we highlight here is the polarising beam splitter ( pbs ) . in circuit diagrams",
    ", it is usually drawn as a box around a regular beam splitter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pbs]a ) . if the pbs is cut to separate horizontal and vertical polarisation , the transformation of the incoming modes ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) yields the following outgoing modes ( ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) : @xmath46 we can also cut the pbs to different polarisation directions ( e.g. , @xmath47 and @xmath25 ) , in which case we make the substitution @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "diagrammatically a pbs cut with a different polarisation usually has a circle drawn inside the box ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pbs]b ) .    at this point",
    ", we should devote a few words to the term `` linear optics '' .",
    "typically this denotes the set of optical elements whose interaction hamiltonian is bilinear in the creation and annihilation operators : @xmath50 an operator of this form commutes with the total number operator , and has the property that a simple mode transformation of creation operators into a linear combination of other creation operators affects only the matrix @xmath51 , but does not introduce terms that are quadratic ( or higher ) in the creation or annihilation operators .",
    "however , from a field - theoretic point of view , the most general linear bogoliubov transformation of creation and annihilation operators is given by @xmath52 clearly , when such a transformation is substituted in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bilinear ] ) this will give rise to terms such as @xmath53 and @xmath54 , i.e. , squeezing .",
    "the number of photons is not conserved in such a process . for the purpose of this review",
    ", we exclude squeezing as a resource other than as a method for generating single photons .    with the linear optical elements introduced in this section we can build large optical networks . in particular , we can make computational circuits by using known states as the input and measuring the output states .",
    "next we will study these optical circuits in more detail .",
    "an optical circuit can be thought of as a black box with incoming and outgoing modes of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the black box transforms a state of the incoming modes into a different state of the outgoing modes .",
    "the modes might be mixed by beam splitters , or they may pick up a relative phase shift or polarisation rotation . these operations all belong to a class of optical components that preserve the photon number , as described in the previous section .",
    "in addition , the box may include measurement devices , the outcomes of which may modify optical components on the remaining modes .",
    "this is called _ feed - forward _ detection , and it is an important technique that can increase the efficiency of a device @xcite .",
    "optical circuits can also be thought of as a general unitary transformation on @xmath0 modes , followed by the detection of a subset of these modes ( followed by unitary transformation on the remaining modes , detection , and so on ) .",
    "the interferometric part of this circuit is also called an @xmath0 port interferometer .",
    "@xmath0 ports yield a unitary transformation @xmath55 of the spatial field modes @xmath56 , with @xmath57 : @xmath58 where the incoming modes of the @xmath0 port are denoted by @xmath59 and the outgoing modes by @xmath60 . the explicit form of @xmath55 is given by the repeated application of transformations such as given in eqs .",
    "( [ ps2 ] ) , ( [ 2bs ] ) , and ( [ 2polrot ] ) .",
    "the two - mode operators @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 form an @xmath64 lie algebra : @xmath65 = \\pm \\hat{l}_{\\pm } \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad   [ \\hat{l}_+,\\hat{l}_- ] = 2 \\hat{l}_0\\ ; .\\ ] ] this means that any two - mode interferometer exhibits @xmath66 symmetry ) , which is why an interferometer is described by @xmath67 , rather than @xmath68 . ] . in general , an @xmath0 port interferometer can be described by a transformation from the group @xmath67 .",
    "reck et al .",
    "( 1994 ) demonstrated that the converse is also true , i.e. , that any unitary transformation of @xmath0 optical modes can be implemented efficiently with an @xmath0 port interferometer .",
    "they showed how a general @xmath67 element can be broken down into @xmath69 elements , for which we have a complete physical representation in terms of beam splitters and phase shifters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : reck ] ) .",
    "the primitive element is a matrix @xmath70 defined on the modes @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which corresponds to a beam splitter and phase shifts .",
    "implicit in this notation is the identity operator on the rest of the optical modes , such that @xmath73 .",
    "we then have @xmath74 where @xmath16 is a single - mode phase . concatenating",
    "this procedure leads to a full decomposition of @xmath67 into @xmath26 elements , which in turn are part of @xmath69 .",
    "the maximum number of beam splitter elements @xmath26 that are needed is @xmath75 .",
    "this procedure is thus manifestly scalable .",
    "subsequently , it was shown by trm et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) and jex et al .",
    "( 1995 ) how one can construct multi - mode hamiltonians that generate these unitary mode - transformations , and a three - path mach - zehnder interferometer was demonstrated experimentally by weihs et al.(1996 ) . a good introduction to linear optical networks is given by leonhardt ( 2003 ) and a determination of effective hamiltonians is given by leonhardt and neumaier ( 2004 ) . for a treatment of optical networks in terms of their _ permanents",
    "_ , see scheel ( 2004 ) . optical circuits in a ( general ) relativistic setting are described by kok and braunstein ( 2006 ) .",
    "formally , a qubit is a quantum system with an @xmath69 symmetry .",
    "we saw above that two optical modes form a natural implementation of this symmetry .",
    "in general , two modes with fixed total photon number @xmath76 furnish natural irreducible representations of this group with the dimension of the representation given by @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "it is at this point not specified whether we should use spatial or polarisation modes . in linear optical quantum computing , the qubit of choice is usually taken to be a single photon that has the choice of two different modes @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this is called a dual - rail qubit .",
    "when the two modes represent the internal polarisation degree of freedom of the photon ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) , we speak of a _ polarisation qubit_. in this review we will reserve the term `` dual rail '' for a qubit with two spatial modes . as we showed earlier , these two representations are mathematically equivalent , and we can physically switch between them using polarisation beam splitters .",
    "in addition , some practical applications ( typically involving a dephasing channel such as a fibre ) may call for so - called _ time - bin _ qubits , in which the two computational qubit values are `` early '' and `` late '' arrival times in a detector .",
    "however , this degree of freedom does not exhibit a natural internal @xmath69 symmetry : arbitrary single - qubit operations are very difficult to implement . in this review",
    "we will be concerned mainly with polarisation and dual - rail qubits .    in order to build a quantum computer , we need both single - qubit operations as well as two - qubit operations .",
    "single - qubit operations are generated by the pauli operators @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 , in the sense that the operator @xmath85 is a rotation about the @xmath3-axis in the bloch sphere with angle @xmath32 .",
    "as we have seen , these operations can be implemented with phase shifters , beam splitters , and polarisation rotations on polarisation and dual - rail qubits . in this review",
    ", we will use the convention that @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 denote physical processes , while we use @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for the corresponding logical operations on the qubit .",
    "these two representations become inequivalent when we deal with logical qubits that are encoded in multiple physical qubits .    whereas single - qubit operations are straightforward in the polarisation and dual - rail representation , the two - qubit gates are more problematic .",
    "consider , for example , the transformation from a state in the computational basis to a maximally entangled bell state : @xmath89 this is the type of transformation that requires a two - qubit gate . in terms of the creation operators ( and ignoring normalisation ) , the linear optical circuit that is supposed to create bell states out of computational basis states",
    "is described by a bogoliubov transformation of both creation operators @xmath90 it is immediately clear that the right - hand sides in both lines can not be made the same for any choice of @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , and @xmath94 : the top line is a separable expression in the creation operators , while the bottom line is an entangled expression in the creation operators .",
    "therefore , linear optics alone can not create maximal polarisation entanglement from single polarised photons in a deterministic manner @xcite .",
    "entanglement that is generated by changing the definition of our subsystems in terms of the global field modes is inequivalent to the entanglement that is generated by applying true two - qubit gates to single - photon polarisation or dual - rail qubits .",
    "note also that if we choose our representation of the qubit differently , we _ can _ implement a two - qubit transformation .",
    "consider the _ single - rail _ qubit encoding @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "that is , the qubit is given by the vacuum and the single - photon state .",
    "we can then implement the following ( unnormalised ) transformation deterministically : @xmath97 this is a 50:50 beam splitter transformation .",
    "however , in this representation the single - qubit operations can not be implemented deterministically with linear optical elements , since these transformations do not preserve the photon number @xcite .",
    "this implies that we can not implement single - qubit and two - qubit gates deterministically for the same physical representation . for linear optical quantum computing",
    ", we typically need the ability to ( dis- ) entangle field modes .",
    "we therefore have to add a non - linear component to our scheme .",
    "two possible approaches are the use of kerr nonlinearities , which we briefly review in the next section , and the use of _ projective measurements_. in the rest of this review , we concentrate mainly on linear optical quantum computing with projective measurements , based on the work by knill , laflamme , and milburn .    finally , in order to make a quantum computer with light that can outperform any classical computer , we need to understand more about the criteria that make quantum computers `` quantum '' . for example , some simple schemes in quantum communication require only superpositions of quantum states to distinguish them from their corresponding classical ones . however , we know that this is not sufficient for general computational tasks .",
    "first , we give two definitions .",
    "the _ pauli group _",
    "@xmath98 is the set of pauli operators with coefficients @xmath99 .",
    "for instance , the pauli group for one qubit is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the identity matrix .",
    "the pauli group for @xmath76 qubits consists of elements that are products of @xmath76 pauli operators , including the identity .",
    "in addition , we define the _ clifford group _ @xmath102 of transformations that leave the pauli group invariant . in other words , for any element of the clifford group @xmath103 and any element of the pauli group @xmath71 , we have @xmath104 prominent members of the clifford group are the hadamard transformation , phase transformations , and the controlled - not ( cnot ) ) for a definition of the cnot operation . ] note that the pauli group is a subgroup of the clifford group .",
    "the gottesman - knill theorem ( 1999 ) states that any quantum algorithm that initiates in the computational basis and employs only transformations ( gates ) from the the clifford group , along with projective measurements in the computational basis , can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer .",
    "this means there is no computational advantage in restricting the quantum computer to such circuits .",
    "a classical machine could simulate them efficiently .    in discrete - variable quantum information processing",
    ", the gottesman - knill theorem provides a valuable tool for assessing the classical complexity of a given process .",
    "( for a precise formulation and proof of this theorem , see nielsen and chuang , page 464 ) .",
    "although the set of gates in the pauli and clifford groups does not satisfy the universality requirements , the addition of a single - qubit @xmath105 gate will render the set universal . in single - photon quantum information processing",
    "we have easy access to such single - qubit operations .      before the work of knill , laflamme , and milburn ( klm ) , quantum information processing with linear optics was studied ( among other things ) in non - scalable architectures by cerf , adami , and kwiat ( 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "their linear optical protocol can be considered a _ simulation _ of a quantum computer : @xmath76 qubits are represented by a single photon in @xmath106 different paths . in such an encoding , both single- and two - qubit gates are easily implemented using ( polarisation ) beam splitters and phase shifters . for example , let a single qubit be given by a single photon in two optical modes : @xmath107 and @xmath108 . the hadamard gate acting on this qubit",
    "can then be implemented with a 50:50 beam splitter given by eq .",
    "( [ 2bs ] ) with @xmath30 , and two @xmath109 phase shifters ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cerf]a ) : @xmath110 where we suppressed the normalisation .",
    "the cnot gate in the cerf , adami , and kwiat protocol is even simpler : suppose that the two optical modes in fig .",
    "[ fig : cerf]b carry polarisation .",
    "the spatial degree of freedom carries the control qubit , and the polarisation carries the target . if the photon is in the vertical spatial mode , it will undergo a polarisation rotation ; thus implementing a cnot .",
    "the control and target qubits can be interchanged trivially using a polarisation beam splitter .",
    "since this protocol requires an exponential number of optical modes , this is a simulation rather than a fully scalable quantum computer .",
    "other proposals in the same spirit include work by clauser and dowling ( 1996 ) , summhammer ( 1997 ) , spreeuw ( 1998 ) , and ekert ( 1998 ) . using this simulation , a classical version of grover s search algorithm",
    "can be implemented @xcite .",
    "general quantum logic using polarised photons was studied by trm and stenholm ( 1996 ) , stenholm ( 1996 ) , and franson and pittman ( 1999 ) .    prior to klm",
    ", it was widely believed that scalable all - optical quantum computing needed a nonlinear component , such as a _",

    "a beam traversing through a kerr medium will then experience a phase shift that is proportional to its intensity .",
    "a variation on this is the _ cross - kerr _ medium , in which the phase shift of a signal beam is proportional to the intensity of a second probe beam . in the language of quantum optics",

    "consider two photons in separate spatial modes interacting on a 50:50 beam splitter .",
    "the transformation will be @xmath141 it is clear ( from the second and third line ) that the bosonic nature of the electromagnetic field gives rise to _ photon bunching _ : the incoming photons pair off together .",
    "this is a strictly quantum - mechanical effect , since classically , the two photons could equally well end up in different output modes . in terms of quantum interference ,",
    "there are two paths leading from the input state @xmath142 to the output state @xmath143 : either both photons are transmitted , or both photons are reflected .",
    "the relative phases of these paths are determined by the beam splitter equation ( [ 2bs ] ) : @xmath144 , and the two paths cancel exactly , irrespective of the value of @xmath23 .",
    "the absence of the @xmath145 term is called the hong - ou - mandel effect @xcite , and it lies at the heart of linear optical quantum computing .",
    "however , as we have argued in section [ qulo ] , this is not enough to make deterministic linear optical quantum computing possible , and we have to turn our attention instead to _ probabilistic gates_.    as was shown by lloyd ( 1995 ) , almost any two - qubit gate is universal for quantum computing ( in addition to single - qubit gates ) , but in linear optics we usually consider the controlled - phase gate ( cz , also sometimes known as cphase or csign ) and the controlled - not gate ( cnot ) . in terms of a truth table , they induce the following transformations @xmath146 which is identical to    @xmath147 takes the qubit values 0 and 1 , while @xmath148 is taken modulo 2 .    a cz gate can be constructed in linear optics using two _ nonlinear sign _ ( ns ) gates .",
    "the ns gate acts on the three lowest fock states in the following manner : @xmath149 its action on higher number states is irrelevant , as long as it does not change the amplitudes of @xmath150 , @xmath151 , or @xmath152 .",
    "consider the optical circuit drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : cz_klm ] , and suppose the ( separable ) input state is given by latexmath:[$|\\phi_1\\rangle \\otimes |\\phi_2\\rangle = ( \\alpha |0,1\\rangle + \\beta |1,0\\rangle)(\\gamma |0,1\\rangle + \\delta    to the first and third mode , and find the hong - ou - mandel effect only when both modes are populated by one photon .",
    "the ns gates will then induce a phase shift of @xmath139 . applying a second beam splitter operation yields @xmath154",
    "this is no longer separable in general .",
    "in fact , when we choose @xmath155 , then the output state is a maximally entangled state . the overall probability of this cz gate @xmath156 .",
    "it is immediately clear that we can not make the ns gate with a regular phase shifter , because only the state @xmath152 picks up a phase .",
    "a linear optical phase shifter would also induce a factor @xmath157 ( or @xmath158 ) in the state @xmath151 .",
    "however , it is possible to perform the ns - gate _ probabilistically _ using projective measurements .",
    "the fact that two ns gates can be used to create a cz gate was first realized by knill , laflamme , and milburn ( 2001 ) .",
    "their probabilistic ns gate is a 3-port device , including two ancillary modes the output of which is measured with perfect photon - number discriminating detectors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ns_klm ] ) .",
    "the input states for the ancill  are the vacuum and a single - photon , and the gate succeeds when the detectors @xmath159 and @xmath160 measure zero and one photons , respectively . for an arbitrary input state @xmath161 gate defined by @xmath162 .",
    "several simplifications of the ns gate were reported shortly after the original klm proposal .",
    "first , a 3-port ns gate with only marginally lower success probability @xmath163 was proposed by ralph et al .",
    "( 2002b ) .",
    "this gate uses only two beam splitters ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : ns_rwmm ] ) .",
    "secondly , similar schemes using two ancillary photons have been proposed @xcite .",
    "these protocols have success probabilities of 20% and 25% , respectively .",
    "finally , a scheme equivalent to the one by ralph et al .  was proposed by rudolph and pan ( 2001 ) , in which the variable beam splitters are replaced with polarisation rotations",
    ". these might be more convenient to implement experimentally , since the irrational transmission and reflection coefficients of the beam splitters are translated into polarisation rotation angles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ns_rudolph ] ) . for pedagogical purposes",
    ", we treat this gate in a little more detail .",
    "assume that the input mode is horizontally polarised .",
    "the polarisation rotation then gives @xmath164 and the input state transforms according to    @xmath165 \\hat{b}_v^{\\dagger } |0\\rangle \\ ; .\\ ] ]    detecting no photons in the first output port yields @xmath166 after which we apply the second polarisation rotation : @xmath167 and @xmath168 .",

    "finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : knill ] , the circuit of the cz gate by knill ( 2002 ) is shown .",
    "the success probability is 2/27 .",
    "this is the most efficient cz gate known to date .",
    "sometimes it might be sufficient to apply destructive two - photon gates .",
    "for example , a bell measurement in teleportation does not need to be non - destructive in order to sucessfully teleport a photon . in this case",
    ", we can increase the probability of success of the gate considerably . a cnot gate that needs post - selection to make sure",
    "there is one polarised photon in each output mode was proposed by ralph et al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "it makes use only of beam splitters with reflection coefficient of 1/3 , and polarising beam splitters .",
    "the success probability is 1/9 .",
    "an identical gate was proposed independently by hofmann and takeuchi ( 2002 ) .",
    "it was also shown that the success probability of an array of @xmath76 cz gates of this type can be made to operate with a probability of @xmath174 , rather than @xmath175 @xcite .",
    "a special optical gate that will become important in section [ sec : imp ] is the so - called _",
    "parity check_. it consists of a single polarizing beam splitter , followed by photon detection in the complementary basis of one output mode .",
    "if the input modes are denoted by @xmath176 and @xmath123 , and the output modes are @xmath103 and @xmath177 , then the bogoliubov transformation is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : pbs ] ) . for two input qubits in the computational basis",
    "@xmath178 this gate induces the following transformation : latexmath:[\\ ] ] note that the second and third terms in this sum have no photons in modes @xmath123 and @xmath176 , respectively . we then have that @xmath443 if the excitation probability amplitudes at each frequency are identical , @xmath444 this quantity is zero .",
    "in other words , only if the two - single photon wave packets are identical do we see a complete cancellation of the coincidence probability .",
    "this is the second essential diagnostic for a single - photon source .",
    "of course in practice , complete cancellation is unlikely . the extent to which the coincidence rate approaches zero is a measure of the quality of a single - photon source as far as loqc is concerned . whether or not this is the case depends on the nature of the single photon sources . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hom ] we have reproduced the experimental results for the hong - ou - mandel effect , shown with one of the inas quantum dot single - photon sources of santori et al .  ( 2002b ) .    broadly speaking , there are currently two main schemes used to realise single photon sources : ( i ) conditional spontaneous parametric down conversion , and ( ii ) cavity - qed raman schemes . as discussed by rohde and ralph ( 2005 ) , type ( i )",
    "corresponds to a gaussian distribution of @xmath436 as a function of @xmath76 and thus is the continuum analogue of the binomial state defined in eq .",
    "( [ binomial ] ) .",
    "the second scheme , type ( ii ) , leads to a temporal pulse structure that is the convolution of the excitation pulse shape and the lorentzian line shape of a cavity .",
    "if the cavity decay time is the longest time in the dynamics , the distribution @xmath436 takes the lorentzian form given in eq .",
    "( [ lorentzian ] ) . an early single - photon source based on an optical emitter in a micro - cavity was proposed and demonstrated by de  martini et al .",
    "( 1996 ) .",
    "cavity - based single - photon sources are very complicated experiments in their own right , and instead , most single - photon sources used in loqc experiments are based on parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) . in pdc",
    "a short - wavelength pump laser generates photon pairs of longer wavelength in a birefringent crystal .",
    "pdc can yield extremely high fidelities ( @xmath445 ) because the data is usually obtained via post - selection : we take only those events into account that yield the right number of detector coincidents .",
    "in addition , pdc facilitates good mode matching due to energy and momentum conservation in the down - conversion process .",
    "the output of a non - collinear type - i pdc can be written as @xmath446 where @xmath5 is the @xmath76-photon fock state , and @xmath447 is a measure for the amount of down - conversion .",
    "the probability for creating @xmath76 photon pairs is @xmath448 , which exhibits pair bunching .",
    "when @xmath447 is small , we can make a probabilistic single - photon gun by detecting one of the two modes .",
    "however , if we use only bucket detectors without single - photon resolution , then increasing @xmath447 will also increase the amplitudes for a two - photon pair and ultimately high - photon pairs to the output state .",
    "consequently , the single - photon source will deteriorate badly .",
    "a detailed study of the mode structure of the conditional photon pulse has been undertaken by grice et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "another consideration regarding parametric down - conversion is that the photons in a pair are typically highly entangled in frequency and momentum .",
    "when we use a bucket detector that is sensitive over a broad frequency range to herald a single photon in the freely propagating mode , the lack of frequency information in the detector read - out will cause the single - photon state to be mixed . in principle , this can be remedied by embedding the down - converting material in a micro - cavity such that only certain frequencies are allowed @xcite .",
    "the source will then generate photon pairs with frequencies that match the cavity , and a narrow - band bucket detector can herald a pure single - photon state with a small frequency line width .    alternatively , we can use the following method of making single - photon sources @xcite : consider an array of pdcs with one output mode incident on a photon detector , and the other entering the quantum circuit .",
    "we fire all pdcs simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , all pdc have small @xmath447 , but if there are approximately @xmath449 of them we still create a single photon on average . given that in current pdc configurations @xmath450 , this is quite an inefficient process .",
    "nevertheless , since it contributes a fixed overhead per single photon to the computational resources , this technique is strictly speaking scalable .",
    "for a detailed description of parametric down - conversion as a photon source see uren et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    to illustrate the experimental constraints on the generation of single - photon states , we now review an example of a cavity - qed raman scheme implemented by keller et al .",
    "photon anti - bunching from resonance fluorescence was demonstrated long ago .",
    "if an atom decays spontaneously from an excited to a ground state , a single photon is emitted and a second photon can not be emitted until the atom is re - excited .",
    "unfortunately the photon is emitted into a dipole radiation pattern over a complete solid angle .",
    "clearly we need to engineer the electromagnetic environment with mirrors , dielectrics , etc .",
    ", to ensure a preferred mode for emission .",
    "however as pointed out by kiraz et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , this comes at a price . for example , a carefully engineered cavity around a single dipole emitter can change the free field spectral density around the emitter such that a photon is indeed emitted in a preferred direction with an increased rate compared to free space emission .    however , single - photon sources based on spontaneous emission are necessarily compromised by the random nature of spontaneous emission . as demonstrated by rohde , ralph , and nielsen ( 2005 ) ,",
    "single - photon sources that create gaussian wave packets are much more robust to mode mismatching than sources that create lorentzian wave packets .",
    "spontaneous emission processes fall in this last category .",
    "clearly , we prefer a _ stimulated _ emission process yielding a gaussian wave packet . to this end , a number of schemes based on stimulated raman emission into a cavity mode have been proposed @xcite . as an example , we discuss the experiment by keller et al .",
    "( 2004 ) in some detail .",
    "consider the three - level atomic system in fig .",
    "[ fig : raman ] .",
    "the ground state is coupled to the excited state via a two - photon raman process mediated by a well - detuned third level . in the experiment by keller et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , a calcium ion @xmath451 was trapped in a cavity via an rf ion trap .",
    "the cavity field is nearly resonant with the @xmath452 transition .",
    "initially there is no photon in the cavity .",
    "an external laser is directed onto the ion and is nearly resonant with the @xmath453 transition .",
    "when this laser is switched on , the atom can be excited to the @xmath454 level by absorbing one pump photon and _ emitting _ one photon in to the cavity . since this is a stimulated raman process , the time of emission of the photon into the cavity is completely controlled by the temporal structure of the pump pulse .",
    "the photon in the cavity then decays through the end mirror , again as a poisson process , at a rate given by the cavity decay rate .",
    "this can be made very fast .    in principle",
    "one can now calculate the probability per unit time to detect a single photon emitted from the cavity . if we assume every photon emitted is detected , this probability is simply @xmath455 where @xmath456 is the cavity decay rate and @xmath457 are the annihilation and creation operators for the _ intra - cavity _ field and @xmath458 , \\ ] ] where @xmath459 is the total density operator for ion - plus - cavity - field system .",
    "this may be obtained by solving a master equation describing the interaction of the electronic states of the ion and the two fields , one of which is the time - dependent pump . of course",
    ", for a general time - dependent pump pulse - shape this can only be done numerically .",
    "some typical examples are quoted by keller et al . indeed by carefully controlling the pump pulse shape considerable control over the temporal structure of the single - photon detection probability may be achieved . in the experiment",
    "the length of the pump pulse was controlled to optimise the single - photon output rate .",
    "the efficiency of emission was found to be about @xmath460 , that is to say , @xmath461 of the pump pulses did not lead to a single - photon detection event .",
    "this was in accordance with the theoretical simulations .",
    "these photons are probably lost through the sides of the cavity .",
    "it is important to note that this kind of loss does not affect the temporal mode structure of the emitted ( and detected ) photons .    in a similar way we can compute the second - order correlation function via @xmath462,\\ ] ] where @xmath463 is a formal specification of the solution to the master equation for a time @xmath26 after the `` initial '' conditional state @xmath464 . once again , due to the non stationary nature of the problem , this must be computed numerically .",
    "however , if the pump pulse duration is very short compared to the cavity decay time , and the cavity decay time is the fastest decay constant in the system , the probability amplitude to excite a single photon in a cavity at frequency @xmath403 is very close to lorentzian .",
    "the experiment revealed a clear suppression of the peak at @xmath426 in the normalised correlation function @xmath465 , thus passing the first test of a good single photon source .",
    "unfortunately , a hong - ou - mandel interference experiment was not reported .",
    "for a practical linear - optical quantum computer , however , we need good microscopic single - photon sources that can be produced in large numbers .",
    "a recent review on this topic by lounis and orrit ( 2005 ) identifies six types of microscopic sources : i ) atoms and ions in the gaseous phase ; ii ) organic molecules at low temperature and room temperature ; iii ) chromophoric systems ; iv ) colour centres in diamond , such as nitrogen - vacancy or nickel - nitrogen ; v ) semiconductor nano - crystals ; and vi ) self - assembled quantum dots and other hetero - structures such as micro - pillars and micro - mesa , quantum dots , and electrically driven dots .",
    "the typical physical mechanisms that reduce the indistinguishability of the single - photon sources are dephasing of the optical transition , spectral diffusion , and incoherent pumping .",
    "an earlier review on this topic is given by greulich and thiel ( 2001 ) .",
    "the subject of single - photon sources using quantum dots was reviewed by santori et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    when single - photon sources are less than ideal , linear optics might be employed in order to improve the output state .",
    "for example , if the source succeeds with probability @xmath71 , then the output of the source might be @xmath466 , where we assumed that the failure output results in a vacuum state .",
    "using multiple copies of @xmath207 , linear optics , and ideal photon detection , one may increase the probability up to @xmath329 , but not higher @xcite . a general discussion on improving single - photon sources with linear optical post - processing is given by berry et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "single - photon sources must not only create clean single - photon states , in the sense described above , but all sources must also generate _",
    "identical _ states in order to achieve good visibility in a hong - ou - mandel test .",
    "typical experiments demonstrating single - photon sources create subsequent single - photon states in the _ same _ source and employ a delay line to interfere the two photons .",
    "this way , two - photon quantum interference effects are demonstrated without having to rely on identical sources @xcite .",
    "de riedmatten et al . demonstrated quantum interference by using identical pulse shapes triggering different photon sources @xcite . in applications other than loqc , such as cryptography",
    ", the requirement of indistinguishable sources may be relaxed .",
    "this leads to the concept of the _ suitability _ of a source for a particular application @xcite .",
    "a variation on single - photon sources is the _ entangled - photon source_. we define an ideal entangled - photon source as a source that creates a two - photon polarisation bell state .",
    "this is an important resource in both the browne - rudolph and the gilchrist - hayes - ralph protocol .",
    "it is known that these states can not be created deterministically from single - photon sources , linear optics and destructive photon detection @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such states are very desirable , since they would dramatically reduce the cost of linear - optical quantum computing .",
    "the same error models for single - photon sources apply to entangled - photon sources .",
    "again , a great variety of proposals for entangled - photon sources exist in the literature , using quantum dots ( benson et al .",
    "2000 ; stace et al .  2003 ) or parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "two - photon states without entanglement have been created experimentally by moreau et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and santori et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , as have entangled photon pairs @xcite .",
    "in addition to detector errors , and errors in the single - photon sources , there is a possibility that the optical circuits themselves acquire errors .",
    "probably the most important circuit error is _",
    "mode mismatching_. it occurs when non - identical wave packets are used in an interferometric setup [ e.g. , the coefficients @xmath436 and @xmath437 in eq .",
    "( [ modematch ] ) are not identical ] .",
    "there is a plethora of reasons why the coefficients @xmath436 and @xmath437 might not be equal .",
    "for example , the optical components might not do exactly what they are supposed to do .",
    "more precisely , the interaction hamiltonian of the components will differ from its specifications .",
    "one manifestation of this is that there is a finite accuracy in the parameters in the interaction hamiltonian of any optical component , leading to changes in phases , beam splitter transmission coefficients , and polarisation rotation angles .",
    "in addition , unwanted birefringence in the dielectric media can cause photo - emission and squeezing .",
    "inaccurate hamiltonian parameters generally reduce the level of mode matching , leading , for example , to a reduced hong - ou - mandel effect and hence inaccurate cz gates .",
    "indeed , mode matching is likely to be the main circuit error .",
    "most of this effect is due to non - identical photon sources , which we discussed in the previous section .",
    "the effect of frequency and temporal mode mismatching was studied by rohde and ralph ( 2005 ) , and by rohde , ralph , and nielsen ( 2005 ) .",
    "a second error mechanism is that typically , components such as beam splitters , half- and quarter - wave plates , etc .",
    "are made of dielectric media that have a ( small ) absorption amplitude .",
    "scheel ( 2005 ) showed that there is a lower bound on the absorption amplitude in physical beam splitters .",
    "in addition , imperfect impedance matching of the boundaries will scatter photons back to the source .",
    "this amounts to photon loss in the optical circuit . in large circuits",
    ", these losses can become substantial .",
    "a third error mechanism is due to classical errors in the feed - forward process .",
    "this process consists of the read - out of a photon detector , classical post - processing , and conditional switching of the optical circuit .",
    "the detection errors have been discussed in section [ sec : detectors ] and classical computing is virtually error - free due to robust classical error correction .",
    "optical switches , however , are still quite lossy @xcite . in addition ,",
    "when high - voltage pockels cells are used , the repetition rate is slow ( on the order of 10 khz ) .",
    "this may become too slow , as photons need to be stored in a quantum memory ( e.g. , a delay loop ) , which itself may be lossy and needs feed - forward processing .",
    "feed - forward control for loqc was demonstrated by pittman et al .",
    "( 2002a ) and giacomini et al.(2002 ) .    an important component of linear optical quantum computing that we have ignored",
    "so far is the _",
    "quantum memory_. when the probability of a successful ( teleported ) gate or addition to a cluster state becomes small , the photons that are part of the circuit must be stored for a considerable time while the off - line preparation of entangled photons is taking place .",
    "the use of mere fibre loops then becomes problematic , as these induce photon losses ( 0.17  db@xmath467km@xmath468 in a standard telecom fibre at 1550  nm ) .",
    "for example , to store a photon for 100  @xmath395s in a fibre has a loss probability of @xmath469 . at present , all linear optical quantum computer proposals need some kind of quantum memory .",
    "this may be in the form of delay lines with error correction , atomic vapours , solid - state implementations , etc .",
    "in general , the effect of a quantum memory error boils down to the inequality of the input state @xmath470 and the ( time - translated ) output state @xmath471 .",
    "a good figure of merit is the fidelity @xmath472 : @xmath473 ^ 2 \\ ; .\\ ] ] the absence of a photon in the output state is an obvious failure mechanism , but other ways the memory can fail include qubit decoherence and mode mismatching of the input / output modes . in this sense , the design specifications of a solid - state based quantum memory are more stringent than those for solid - state single - photon sources : not only does it need to produce a single photon with very high fidelity , it also needs the ability to couple a photon _ into _ the device with very high probability .",
    "note that we do not have to couple a photonic _ qubit _ into a quantum memory : we can use two photon memories to store one qubit , provided the memory does not retain information about whether a photon was stored or not .",
    "a proof - of - principle for a free - space delay line was given by pittman and franson ( 2002 ) , and quantum memory delay lines using quantum error correction and qnd measurements were proposed by gingrich et al .",

    "other proposals include dark - state polaritons @xcite , and single - photon cavity qed @xcite .",
    "to achieve quantum computing despite inevitable physical errors in the quantum computer , we have to employ error correction ( ec ) .",
    "typically , an error - correction protocol consists of a circuit that can correct for one or more types of error .",
    "however , these circuits will in turn introduce errors . for an ec protocol to be useful , the error in the circuit _",
    "after _ the ec protocol must be smaller than the error _ before _ the ec protocol . repeated nested application of the ec protocol ( so - called _ concatenation _ ) can then reduce the errors to arbitrarily small levels . in doing so",
    ", we must take care not to sacrifice the scaling behaviour of the quantum computer .",
    "this is captured in the notion of _ fault tolerance_. the magnitude of the errors for which fault tolerance breaks down is called the fault - tolerant _ threshold_. for more details , see nielsen and chuang ( 2000 ) .",
    "general fault - tolerant thresholds for quantum computing have been derived by steane ( 2003 ) and knill ( 2005 ) , and here we address loqc specific error correction and fault - tolerant thresholds .",
    "we have seen that the klm scheme employs a certain level of error correction in order to turn high - probability teleported gates into near - deterministic gates , even though all - optical components are ideal . in this section ,",
    "we discuss how an loqc architecture can be developed with robustness against component errors .",
    "different error models will typically lead to different levels of robustness .",
    "for example , in the cluster - state approach of browne and rudolph , we can relax the condition of perfect photon counting given ideal photon sources . the type - ii fusion operation described in section [ sec : br ] must give a coincidence count in the two detectors .",
    "any other detector signature heralds an error .",
    "so if the photon detectors are lossy , the rate of coincidence counts is reduced .",
    "since the fusion operation is already probabilistic , a reduced success rate translates into a larger overhead in the cluster - state generation .",
    "however , if the photon sources are not ideal and if there is a substantial number of dark counts in the detectors , then we rapidly lose quantum information .",
    "this raises two important questions : ( 1 ) given a certain error model , what is the error correcting capability for a given loqc architecture ?",
    "( 2 ) what is the realistic error model ?",
    "this last question depends on the available photon sources , detectors and memories , as well as the architecture of the optical quantum computer .",
    "currently , theoretical research in loqc is concentrating on these questions .",
    "the three main errors that need to be coded against are inefficient detectors , noisy photon sources , and unfaithful quantum memories .",
    "there are other error mechanisms as well ( see section [ sec : real ] ) , and these will become important in concatenated error correction . in order to find the fault - tolerant level for a given architecture , these other errors must be taken into account . in the next section ,",
    "we discuss how photon loss can be corrected in both the cluster - state model and the circuit - based model . in section [ sec : ft ]",
    "we discuss fault - tolerant quantum computing in the cluster - state model .",
    "we first consider photon loss .",
    "its effect on the original teleportation component in the klm protocol was studied by glancy et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , who found that in the klm scheme a gate teleportation fidelity better than 99% requires detectors with an efficiency @xmath474 . using the seven qubit css quantum code , the photon loss @xmath262 in the klm scheme",
    "is allowed to be as large as @xmath475 , depending on the construction of the entangling gates @xcite . using the type - i and type - ii fusion gates in creating entanglement",
    ", the photon loss can be much higher : in the browne - rudolph protocol , a low detection efficiency merely reduces the rate with which the cluster state is created , whereas in the circuit - based model a low detection efficiency requires a higher level of encoding .",
    "however , we not only need the ability to grow the cluster or the parity encoding efficiently , we also need to do the single - qubit measurements .",
    "since in loqc the single - qubit measurements amount to photon detection , we have a problem : failing to measure a photon is also a single - qubit failure .",
    "therefore , every logical qubit must be constructed with multiple photons , such that photon loss can be recovered from . in particular",
    ", this means that we can no longer straightforwardly remove redundant qubits in the cluster - state model if they are not properly encoded . in this section ,",
    "we show how cluster states can be protected from photon loss by `` planting trees '' in the cluster @xcite , and we will describe how an extra layer of encoding protects the circuit model of ralph , hayes , and gilchrist ( 2005 ) from detection inefficiency , probabilistic sources , and memory loss .",
    "varnava , browne , and rudolph ( 2005 ) introduced a code exploiting the property that a cluster state is an eigenstate of every stabiliser generator , and that the eigenvalue of each is known beforehand ( we will assume that all eigenvalues are @xmath476 ) .",
    "this allows us to measure the value of a lost qubit as follows : suppose we wish to measure a qubit in the computational basis , that is , we require a @xmath88 measurement .",
    "if that qubit is no longer present , we can choose @xmath477 such that our lost qubit is in the neighbourhood @xmath478 of the @xmath479 qubit . if we successfully measure @xmath480 and all @xmath481 except for the lost qubit",
    ", we can multiply the eigenvalues to find either @xmath476 or @xmath482 .",
    "since the stabiliser generator has eigenvalue @xmath476 , this determines the @xmath88 eigenvalue , and therefore the @xmath88 eigenstate of our lost qubit . in figure",
    "[ fig : horticulture]a , we show how an @xmath86 measurement can be performed on a lost qubit by @xmath88 measurements on the adjacent qubits .    in cluster - state quantum computing",
    ", we need the ability to do single - qubit measurements in an arbitrary basis ; @xmath483 .",
    "to this end , we use the cluster - state property that two adjacent @xmath86 measurements remove the qubits from the cluster and transfer the bonds .",
    "this way , we can plant the qubit labelled @xmath51 into the cluster ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : horticulture]b ) . instead of doing the @xmath51 measurement on the in - line qubit",
    ", we perform the measurement on a qubit in the third ( horizontal ) level .",
    "when this measurement succeeds , we have to break the bonds with all the other qubits in the tree .",
    "therefore , we measure all the remaining qubits in the third level as well as the qubits in the fourth level that are connected to the @xmath51 qubit in the @xmath88 basis .",
    "sometimes the photon detection that constitutes the qubit measurement @xmath51 will fail due to the detector inefficiency . in that case , we can attempt the @xmath51 measurement on a second qubit in the third level .",
    "again , the remaining qubits and the fourth - level qubits connected to the @xmath51 qubit must be measured in the @xmath88 basis . whenever such a @xmath88 measurement fails ( as is the case for the qubit that failed the @xmath51 measurement ) , we need to do an",
    "_ indirect _",
    "@xmath88 measurement according to the method outlined above : when a photonic qubit is lost , we need to choose a stabiliser generator for which that photon was represented by a @xmath88 operator .",
    "the tree structure ensures that such an operator can always be found .",
    "we then measure all the photons in this stabiliser generator to establish the @xmath88 eigenvalue for the lost photon . in the case of additional photon loss",
    ", we repeat this process until we succeed .",
    "when the success probability of the measurement of a logical qubit is given by @xmath71 , then the number of qubits in a tree @xmath76 is given by @xmath484 numerical simulations indicate that a detector loss of up to 50% can be corrected @xcite .",
    "if more than 50% of the photons were allowed to be lost , then we can imagine that all the lost photons are collected by a third party who can perform a measurement complementary to @xmath51 on the same qubit .",
    "since this would violate various no - cloning bounds , such a strategy must be ruled out .",
    "hence , a detection efficiency of 50% is the absolute minimum @xcite .    in the circuit - based model by gilchrist , hayes , and ralph ,",
    "the lowest level of encoding consists of a polarised photon such that @xmath485 and @xmath486 .",
    "the second level of encoding is the parity code @xmath487 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhg ] ) , which allows us to use the probabilistic fusion gates in a deterministic manner . the third level of encoding is a _ redundant encoding _ such that a logical qubit is encoded in a ghz state of parity - encoded qubits @xcite : @xmath488 to demonstrate that this code protects quantum information from photon loss , we show that heralded photon loss merely yields a recoverable error , and that we can perform a universal set of deterministic quantum gates on these logical qubits .",
    "first of all , we note that every pair of optical modes that constitutes the lowest level qubit encoding must contain exactly one photon , and no high number counting is required ( contrary to the klm scheme ) .",
    "this is also true for the browne - rudolph protocol .",
    "we therefore assume that we have bucket detectors with a certain detection efficiency @xmath355 and a negligible dark count rate .",
    "the type - i and type - ii fusion gates are then no longer ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,1 ) strategies , respectively .",
    "the type - i fusion gate ceases to yield pure output states , while the type - ii gate yields a pure output state only if a detector coincidence is found ( we assume perfect sources ) .",
    "a failure not only removes the mode that was involved with the pbs , but we should also measure one mode in order to purify the cluster .",
    "hence , the type - ii fusion gate with bucket detectors is a ( 2,2)-strategy , and the growth requirement is @xmath489 .",
    "suppose we wish to measure the value of the logical qubit @xmath490 in the computational basis ( as we discuss below , any other measurement can be performed by first applying a single - qubit rotation to @xmath490 ) . since the logical qubit is a ghz state , it is sufficient to measure only one parity qubit , e.g. , the first one .",
    "physically , this measurement constitutes a counting of horizontally and vertically polarised photons : if the number of vertically polarised photons is even , then the value of the parity qubit is @xmath491 , and if it is odd , then its value is @xmath492 . in order to successfully establish the parity",
    ", we therefore need to detect _ all _ @xmath76 photons .",
    "when we include photon loss in this measurement , there are three possible measurement outcomes for every optical mode : `` horizontal '' , `` vertical '' , or `` detector failure '' . in the language of povms , this can be written as @xmath493 these povms add up to unity in the subspace spanned by @xmath494 and @xmath495 , as required . a particular measurement outcome on @xmath76 modes can then be written as a string of @xmath76 outcomes @xmath496 , where every @xmath497 .",
    "the optical state after finding a particular measurement outcome @xmath132 is then @xmath498 \\ ; .\\ ] ] when all photons are detected , the qubit is projected onto its logical value .",
    "however , when one or more qubits are lost it is no longer possible to establish the parity .",
    "therefore , as soon as a photon is lost the next photon is measured in a diagonal basis , thus disentangling the parity qubit from the other parity qubits .",
    "a few lines of algebra shows that the remaining @xmath499 parity qubits are in the state @xmath500 in other words , the encoding has become smaller but the quantum information _ has not been erased_. we can therefore retry the measurement of the qubit @xmath72 times .",
    "next , we have to show that we can perform deterministic one- and two - qubit gates using this redundant encoding . to this end ,",
    "recall how deterministic gates were implemented in the parity encoding : a universal set of gates is @xmath501 .",
    "we added a superscript @xmath502 to indicate that these gates act on the parity qubit .",
    "as we have seen , the gates @xmath503 and cnot@xmath504 can not be implemented deterministically , and have to be built using fusion gates .",
    "how can these gates be used to form a universal set on the redundantly encoded ( logical ) qubit ?",
    "first , the single - qubit gate @xmath88 is still implemented deterministically : @xmath505 . therefore , in order to apply a @xmath88 gate , a @xmath84 operation must be applied to all @xmath76 photons in _ one and only one _ parity qubit .",
    "secondly , the gate @xmath283 is diagonal in the computational basis , and can therefore be implemented using one @xmath503 .",
    "thirdly , the @xmath349 gate on the redundantly encoded qubit is somewhat problematic , since the gate transforms separable states of parity qubits into highly entangled ghz states .",
    "however , if we apply @xmath506 cnot@xmath504 gates , we can decode the qubit such that its state is @xmath507 to the first parity qubit , and use another set of @xmath506 cnot@xmath504 gates to re - encode the qubit .",
    "therefore , the gate @xmath349 `` costs '' @xmath508 cnot@xmath504 gates . finally , the cnot gate on the redundantly encoded qubit can be implemented using @xmath72 cnot@xmath504 gates .",
    "since every single - qubit operation can be constructed from @xmath349 and @xmath283 , we can perform arbitrary single - qubit measurements .",
    "we now have a universal set of gates on our logical qubit , together with computational - basis read out and an efficient encoding mechanism .",
    "numerical simulations indicate that this method allows for combined detector , source and memory efficiencies of @xmath509 @xcite .",
    "note that there seem to be conflicting requirements in this code : in order to execute successful fusion gates , we want @xmath76 to be reasonably large .",
    "on the other hand , we want @xmath76 to be as small as possible such that the probability of measuring all @xmath76 photons @xmath510 is not too small .",
    "we assumed that every parity qubit is encoded with the same number of photons @xmath76 , but this is not necessary . in principle , this method works when different parity qubits have different - sized encodings .",
    "however , some care should be taken to choose every @xmath511 as close to the optimal value as possible .",
    "as we mentioned before , photon loss is not the only error in loqc , and creating large cluster trees or a sizable redundant encoding in the circuit model will actually amplify other errors , such as dephasing .",
    "a truly fault - tolerant quantum computer architecture must therefore be able to handle the actual physical noise that will be present . given a certain noise model and error correcting codes , we can derive fault - tolerant _ thresholds _ : the errors must be smaller than the threshold value for concatenated error correction to eliminate them all .",
    "knill et al .  ( 2000 ) considered a combination of photon loss and dephasing in the original klm proposal and found that the accuracy threshold for the optical components in that scheme was higher than 99% .",
    "dawson , haselgrove , and nielsen ( 2006a , b ) performed an extensive numerical study of fault - tolerant thresholds for linear optical cluster state quantum computing .",
    "the computational model they adopted is nielsen s micro - cluster approach , described in section [ sec : nielsen ] , with type - i fusion gates instead of klm - type cz gates .",
    "the physical operations in this model are bell - state preparation , single - photon gates and memories , type - i fusion gates , and photon measurements . the computation proceeds in time steps , with exactly one operation at each step .",
    "furthermore , it is assumed that any two single - photon qubits in the computation can serve as the inputs of the fusion gate . in other words",
    ", we have a _ direct interaction _ between qubits .",
    "in addition , parallel operations are allowed to speed up the computation and minimise the use of quantum memories .",
    "finally , the classical computation needed to control the cluster state computing is taken to be sufficiently fast .    the noise model adopted by dawson et al .",
    "consists of the inherent probabilistic nature of the fusion gates , as well as photon loss and depolarisation at every time step in the computation .",
    "the photon loss is characterised by a uniform loss probability @xmath512 , and the depolarisation comes in two flavours : single - qubit operations have a probability @xmath513 of undergoing a pauli operation @xmath86 , @xmath87 , or @xmath88 . after the bell - state preparation and before the fusion gate input , the two photons undergo a correlated depolarising noise : with probability @xmath514 nothing happens to the qubits , while with probability @xmath515 any of the remaining 15 two - qubit pauli operators are applied .",
    "this is a completely general model for the noise that can affect optical cluster state quantum computing , and the resulting fault - tolerance simulation gives an accuracy threshold region on @xmath512 and @xmath262 .",
    "thresholds were obtained for both a seven - qubit css error correction code and a 23-qubit golay error correction code .",
    "the study shows that scalable quantum computing with the 23-qubit code is possible for a maximum loss probability of @xmath516 and a maximum depolarising probability of @xmath517 .    even though this noise model accounts for general noise , and the fault - tolerant threshold puts a bound on its magnitude , it is clearly a simplification of the physical noise that is expected in cluster state loqc .",
    "it is argued that the difference between correlated two - qubit noise and independent noise does not change the threshold much .",
    "similarly , using one parameter to describe both photon absorption and detector efficiency will not have a dramatic effect on the threshold @xcite .",
    "the next milestone for establishing fault - tolerance thresholds is to adopt a noise model in which the parameters are measurable quantities , such as the visibility in a hong - ou - mandel experiment and photon loss probabilities .",
    "when various parameters in a noise model differ significantly , it might be beneficial to diversify the error correction codes . ec codes that correct specific errors such as photon loss or depolarisation may be smaller than generic ec codes , and therefore introduce less noise . a round of special error correction might be used to reduce large errors , and subsequent generic error correction will further reduce the errors below the fault - tolerant threshold .",
    "in addition , certain types of errors or noise might be naturally suppressed by a suitable alteration in the architecture . for example",
    ", there is a way to create high - fidelity four - photon ghz states with lossy bucket detectors and inefficient sources @xcite .",
    "assume that the bell - pair source creates a state of the form @xmath518 , where @xmath519 is the two - photon polarization singlet state .",
    "this is a reasonable error model when the source obeys selection rules that prevent single - photon components to contribute to the output state ( c.f . ,",
    "benson et al.2000 ) . in order to make a three - photon ghz state using these sources we use a type - i fusion gate and post - select on a single detector click .",
    "the detector click indicates that at least one source created a photon pair .",
    "however , if only one photon pair was created , the output mode of the type - i fusion gate must necessarily empty . by taking the output modes of two type - i fusion gates in two separate three - photon ghz creation attempts , and leading them into a type - ii fusion gate",
    ", we can post - select on finding two detector clicks . as a result",
    ", high - fidelity four - photon ghz states are produced .",
    "several other specialised circuits have been proposed that either detect errors or correct them .",
    "for example , ralph ( 2003 ) proposed a simple demonstration circuit that detects and corrects bit flip errors on a single qubit using the encoded qubit state @xmath520 outlook : beyond linear optics -----------------------------    we have seen in this review that it is possible to construct a quantum computer with linear optics , single - photon sources , and photon detection alone .",
    "knill , laflamme , and milburn ( 2001 ) overturned the conventional wisdom that a lack of direct photon - photon interactions prohibits scalability . since klm",
    ", several groups have proposed modifications to building a linear optical quantum computer with reduced resources and realistic ( noisy ) components .",
    "the basic principles of loqc have all been demonstrated experimentally , predominantly using parametric down - conversion ( pdc ) and bucket photon detection . due to the small efficiency of pdc photon sources ,",
    "however , these techniques can not be considered scalable in a practical sense .",
    "currently , there is a concerted effort to build the necessary single - photon sources , photon detectors , and quantum memories for a scalable linear optical quantum computer . on the theoretical front",
    ", there is an ongoing effort to design more efficient architectures and effective error correction codes tailored to the noise model that is relevant to loqc .    nevertheless , constructing the necessary components and using fault - tolerant encoding is hard , and several extensions to loqc have been proposed . in this last section",
    "we sketch a few additions to the linear optical toolbox that can make quantum computing a little bit easier .",
    "first , we have seen in section [ sec : kerr ] that a cross - kerr nonlinearity can be used to induce a photon - photon interaction , and how two - qubit quantum gates can be constructed using such a nonlinearity .",
    "unfortunately , natural kerr nonlinearities are extremely small , and this is not a practical method for creating optical gates .",
    "however , recently it was suggested that a small nonlinearity might still be used for quantum computing .",
    "it was shown by munro et al .",
    "( 2005 ) how such nonlinearities can make a number - resolving qnd detector , and barrett et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed how a small cross - kerr nonlinearity can be used to perform complete bell measurements without destroying the photons .",
    "subsequently , it was realized by nemoto and munro ( 2004 ) that this technique can also be used to create a deterministic cnot gate on photonic qubits .",
    "recent work in electromagnetically induced transparencies by lukin and imamolu ( 2000 , 2001 ) suggests that the small - but - not - tiny nonlinearities needed for this method are on the threshold of becoming practical .",
    "alternatively , relatively large nonlinearities can be obtained in photonic band - gap materials @xcite .    secondly ,",
    "if we have high - fidelity single - photon sources and memories , it might become beneficial to engineer these systems such that they support coherent single - qubit operations .",
    "this way , we can redefine our qubits as isolated static systems , and we have circumvented the problem of qubit loss . when these matter qubits emit a qubit - dependent photon , they can in turn be entangled using techniques from linear optical quantum computing .",
    "it was shown by barrett and kok ( 2005 ) that such an architecture can support scalable quantum computing , even with current realistic components .",
    "independently , lim et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed how a similar setup can be used to implement deterministic two - qubit quantum gates .",
    "recently , these two methods were combined in a fault tolerant , near - deterministic quantum computer architecture @xcite .",
    "thirdly , franson , jacobs , and pittman proposed the implementation of a two - qubit @xmath521 gate using the quantum zeno effect : two optical fibres are fused and split again , such that the input modes overlap in a small section of the fibre .",
    "this acts as a beam splitter on the modes in the input and output fibres . at regular intervals inside the joint fibre we place atoms with a two - photon transition .",
    "this transition acts as a two - photon measurement , while single - photon wave - packets propagate through the fibre undisturbed .",
    "furthermore , the single - photon wave - packets maintain coherence .",
    "the effect of this repeated two - photon measurement is to suppress the hong - ou - mandel effect via the quantum zeno effect . in this way ,",
    "two single - photon qubits in the input modes are transformed into two single - photon qubits in the output modes and undergo a @xmath521 gate .",
    "finally , an alternative approach to linear optical quantum computing involves encoding qubits in squeezed or coherent states of light @xcite .",
    "linear elements take on a new capability in these implementations .",
    "for example bell measurements and fan - out gates become deterministic elements @xcite .",
    "the downside is that it is difficult to produce the superposition states that are required as resources in such schemes , although considerable theoretical and experimental progress has been made recently @xcite .",
    "if this problem is solved , considerable savings in resources could result from adopting such implementations .    whatever the ultimate architecture of quantum computers will be , there will always remain a task for ( linear ) optical quantum information processing : in order to distribute quantum information over a network of quantum computers , the qubit of choice will most likely be optical .",
    "we therefore believe that the techniques reviewed here are an important step towards full - scale distributed quantum computing  the quantum internet .",
    "we would like to thank james franson , andrew white , geoff pryde , philip walther , and their co - workers for providing us with the experimental data of their respective cnot gates , and charles santori for allowing us to reproduce his figures . pk wishes to thank sean barrett and dan browne for stimulating discussions , radu ionicioiu , michael raymer , and colin williams for valuable comments , and michael nielsen for extensive correspondence on fault - tolerance in loqc .",
