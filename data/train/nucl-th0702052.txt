    "the growing interest in isospin effects in nuclear reactions is motivated by an increasing awareness of the importance of the symmetry term in the nuclear equation of state .",
    "the availability of beams with large neutron - to - proton ratio , @xmath7 , provides the opportunity to explore the symmetry energy in very isospin - asymmetric nuclear systems . in such reactions ,",
    "isospin degree of freedom has prominent roles and can be served as a valuable probe of the symmetry energy term of the nuclear equation of state .",
    "the isotopic composition of the nuclear reaction products contains important information on the role of the isospin on the reaction process .",
    "@xmath7 degree of freedom and its equilibration , as well as the isospin asymmetry dependent terms of the nuclear equation of state ( eos ) @xcite , have motivated detailed measurements of the isotopic distributions of reaction products .",
    "one important observable in heavy - ion collisions for determining the symmetry energy experimentally is the fragment isotopic composition investigated with the recently developed isoscaling approach @xcite .",
    "the isoscaling approach attempts to isolate the effects of the nuclear symmetry energy in the fragment yields , thus allowing a direct study of the symmetry energy term in the nuclear binding energy during formation of hot fragments .",
    "isoscaling refers to a general exponential relation between the yield ratios of given fragments between two reactions which differ only in their isospin asymmetry @xmath8 . in particular ,",
    "if two reactions , 1 and 2 , lead to primary fragments having approximately same temperature but different isospin asymmetry , the ratio @xmath9 of the yields of a given fragment @xmath10 from these primary fragments exhibits an exponential dependence on the neutron number @xmath11 and the atomic number @xmath12 by following form : @xmath13 where @xmath0 and @xmath1 are two scaling parameters and @xmath14 is an overall normalization constant .",
    "this scaling behavior has been observed in a very broad range of reactions @xcite and theoretical calculations @xcite .",
    "a review paper can be found in recent international `` world consensus initiative '' book on `` dynamics and thermodynamics with nuclear degrees of freedom '' @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the isospin effect in sequential binary decay implemented into gemini code by isolating formation of the excited composite system , to learn the sensitivity of the isoscaling parameters with respect to the observable characterizing the source s state by only observing the first step decayed fragments , such as @xmath7 distribution and isotopic characteristics of the evaporated light particle .",

    "<S> isospin effect of the statistical emission fragments from the equilibrated source is investigated in the frame of statistical binary decay implemented into gemini code , isoscaling behavior is observed and the dependences of isoscaling parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 on emission fragment size , source size , source isospin asymmetry and excitation energies are studied . </S>",
