    "plasma emission is proposed as the emission mechanism for most solar radio bursts at meter wavelengths , such as type iii bursts @xcite , type i continuum @xcite , and type ii bursts @xcite . plasma emission is a multistage process .",
    "it includes the generation of langmuir waves ( lws ) , the conversion of lws into fundamental radiation , and the coalescence of langmuir wave pairs into harmonic wave emission @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that fundamental and harmonic radiations are produced by three - wave processes .",
    "parent lws(@xmath6 ) excited by beam instability first decay into product lws(@xmath7 ) and ion sound waves ( @xmath8 ) via the electrostatic decay process @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "then product @xmath7 wave coalesces with parent @xmath6 wave and generates the harmonic emission near @xmath10 by @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the fundamental emission is generated via the process @xmath12 @xcite .    for type iii bursts",
    ", it is widely accepted that the lws are excited by a streaming instability @xcite .",
    "there are two versions of streaming instability , the bump - in - tail instability and weak - beam instability @xcite .",
    "the bump - in - tail version is a resistive instability which is described in term of negative absorption and attributed to a maser action @xcite .",
    "a positive slope of the electron reduced distribution function , @xmath13 , is essential in the resistive instability .",
    "the most favored model for type ii bursts is that type - iii - like streams produced in the shock front drive the langmuir turbulence . for type i bursts ,",
    "the lws could be excited by a loss - cone instability because type i bursts are produced by energetic electrons trapped in magnetic field @xcite . @xcite and @xcite suggested that langmuir turbulence can grow due to a loss - cone anisotropy .",
    "it is a general consensus that type iii radio bursts are produced by the energetic electrons which escape from the sun and generate langmuir turbulence along the field lines , while hard x - ray emissions are produced by bremsstrahlung of the downward electron beams which penetrate to the lower and higher density plasma .",
    "observation investigations @xcite show a strong relationship between the radio type iii bursts and the hard x - ray emissions .",
    "the relationship imply that the energetic electrons which excite the type iii bursts and those which produce the hard x - ray emission during a solar flare originated from a common acceleration site , i.e. , the upward and downward electron beams have the same energy spectrum distribution .",
    "hard x - ray observations demonstrate that energetic electrons usually have a power - law energy distribution with a lower energy cutoff @xcite .",
    "for example , solar hard x - ray observations present that flare - electrons display a power - law distribution within a deka - kev energy range @xcite . the spectrum index usually in the range of 2 - 6 @xcite .",
    "therefore we believe the energetic electrons which produce the type iii radio bursts also have a power - law energy distribution with the lower energy cutoff . in this paper , we study the effects of lower energy cutoff behavior of power - law electrons on the langmuir turbulence .",
    "the power - law electrons can have an reversed distribution below the lower cutoff energy @xmath14 when @xmath15 , here @xmath16 is the temperature of thermal electrons in the ambient plasma .",
    "the effects of magnetic field on the particle - wave interaction can be neglected when @xmath17 , here @xmath18 is the plasma frequency and @xmath19 is the electron gyrofrequency @xcite .",
    "specifically , for solar radio bursts at meter wavelengths , the effects of magnetic field on the interaction between energetic electrons and lws can be neglected because @xmath17 is generally satisfied in the corona plasma @xcite .",
    "this means the energetic electrons in the corona are unmagnetized when in the interaction with lws .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we describe the lower energy cutoff behaviors of power - law electrons and introduce the distribution .",
    "then , the calculating results of the growth rates of lws are discussed in section 3 .",
    "finally summary is presented in section 4 .",
    "as mentioned above , solar hard x - ray observations demonstrate that energetic electrons frequently exhibit a negative power - law energy distribution with a lower energy cutoff .",
    "however , it is difficult to determine the special form of the lower energy cutoff behavior based on observations .",
    "the extreme cases like sharp cutoff and saturation cutoff behavior are discussed in relevant literatures @xcite .",
    "@xcite fitted a more general power - law spectrum with a steepness cutoff by a hyperbolic tangent function . in this paper",
    ", we discuss the lws excited by the power - law electrons with steepness cutoff behavior .",
    "the distribution function of energetic electron beams has the following form in the velocity space : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 is the velocity of energetic electrons which parallel to the ambient magnetic field , @xmath22 is the kinetic energy . @xmath23 and",
    "@xmath14 denote the lower cutoff energy .",
    "@xmath2 is the spectrum index of power - law electrons , @xmath1 is the steepness index and hyperbolic tangent function @xmath24 describe the lower energy cutoff behavior @xcite .",
    "normalized factor @xmath25 can be determined by @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the electron number density of the energetic electrons .",
    "the energy distribution function of the energetic electrons , @xmath28 , can be obtained from @xmath29 as : @xmath30    .",
    "it shows that the slope @xmath31 below @xmath14 is positive when @xmath32 and becomes steeper when steepness index @xmath1 increases.,height=377 ]    figure 1 shows the distribution function @xmath28 versus the kinetic energy @xmath22 of energetic electrons for different steepness index @xmath1 but fixed spectrum index @xmath33 .",
    "the plot shows that the slope @xmath31 is positive ( the positive slope indicates a population reversion ) below the cutoff energy @xmath14 for the general cases of @xmath32 .",
    "it also shows that the slope becomes steeper when steepness index @xmath1 increase .",
    "when @xmath34 , the lower energy cutoff behavior corresponds to the sharp cutoff case , and when @xmath35 , the slope is negative , which is the saturation cutoff case .",
    "wave emission in the corona plasma usually comes up in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "the effect of magnetic fields can be neglected in the emission equations when the frequency of lws is much higher than electron gyrofrequency @xcite . under this assumption ( i.e. , @xmath17 )",
    ", the spiraling motion of energetic electrons can be neglected because the gyroradius ( @xmath36 ) is much larger than the langmuir wavelength ( @xmath37 ) @xcite .",
    "so the dispersion relation of lws becomes @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the wave number of lws , @xmath5 is the thermal velocity of electrons . for a resistive instability of lws and nonrelativistic electrons ,",
    "the growth rate is given by @xcite @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the normalized function by factoring out the factor @xmath27 from @xmath42 .    from the distribution function in equation ( 1 )",

    "@xmath48 is the electron debye length defined with respect to the background plasma .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the relation between the growth rates and steepness index @xmath1 .",
    "different curves are for different steepness index @xmath49 , 5 , 6 , and 7 .",
    "the spectrum index @xmath33 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( c is the velocity of light in vacuum ) have been used .",

    "the growth rates are normalized by @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the electron number density of the ambient plasma . figure 2(a )",
    "clearly shows that , with the increasing of steepness index @xmath1 , the growth rates become higher .",
    "this means that power - law electrons with steepness lower energy cutoff behavior indeed can excite lws and electrons with steeper cutoff behavior ( i.e. , larger steepness index @xmath1 ) can excite lws more easily .",
    "saturation cutoff case is not shown in the plot because energetic electrons with such cutoff behavior can not excite the lws .",
    "as shown in figure 2(b ) , the growth rates of lws decrease with spectrum index @xmath2 . when spectrum index @xmath2 approach to the steepness index @xmath1 , the growth rates are nearly zero and the lws are suppressed .",
    "this indicates that the power - law spectrum of energetic electrons can depress the instability distinctly and the softer spectrum ( i.e. , with a larger @xmath2 ) leads to a lower growth rate .",
    "figure 2(a ) and 2(b ) both show that all the curves reach the maximum growth rates at the approximate equal wave number @xmath57 .",
    "it means that indexes @xmath1 and @xmath2 only determine the magnitude of the growth rates .",
