    "the development of pulse shaping techniques opens new ways to control atomic or molecular processes by laser fields .",
    "many promising results have been obtained in the implementation of closed - loop control experiments ( clc ) based on genetic or evolutionary algorithms ( see @xcite to cite a few ) .",
    "this setup is made of a pulse shaper controlled by the algorithm which from the results of the preceding experiments builds an improved new control field . such algorithms lead to very efficient solutions , but have some negative points . in particular , no insight into the control mechanism is gained from this approach since no knowledge ( or a minimal one ) about the system is needed and the control field is not optimal by construction .    on the theoretical side , optimal control theory ( oct ) is a powerful tool to design electric fields to control quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "numerical aspects of optimal control theory have been largely explored . for simple systems with few energy levels , geometric aspects of optimal control based on the pontryagin maximum principle",
    "@xcite have also been investigated @xcite .",
    "monotonically convergent algorithms is other efficient approach to solve the optimality equations @xcite .",
    "they have been applied with success to a large number of controlled quantum systems in atomic or molecular physics and in quantum computing .",
    "these methods are flexible and can be adapted to different non standard situations encountered in the control of molecular processes . among recent developments",
    ", we can cite the question of nonlinear interaction with the control field @xcite and the question of spectral constraints on the field @xcite .",
    "this latter problem is particularly important in view of experimental applications since not every control field can be produced by pulse shaping techniques @xcite .",
    "for instance , liquid crystal pulse shapers are able to tailor only a piecewise constant fourier transform of the control field in phase and in amplitude .",
    "experimentally , the spectral amplitude and phase are discretized , e.g. into 640 points which is the number of pixels in a currently used standard mask . in this context",
    ", a challenging question is to incorporate advantages and efficiency of oct into clc .",
    "oct should provide insights into the control mechanisms and speed up the convergence of the experimental algorithm towards an optimal solution .",
    "note that the theoretical analysis of the control dynamics is more efficient if the computational schemes can include experimental constraints directly in the algorithm . a brute force strategy which consists in applying the constraints after the optimization leads to worse results .",
    "this paper aims at taking a step towards the answer to this question . for that purpose , we present a monotonically convergent algorithm which can take into account spectral constraints on the control field .",
    "unlike other proposals in the literature  @xcite our approach exactly enforces the monotonicity property which is important to ensure the convergence of the algorithm .",
    "the construction of a monotonic algorithm with spectral constraints is a very difficult task , since constraints in the frequency domain require nonlocal knowledge of the control field at all times whereas this field is computed progressively in time by the algorithm .",
    "these two requirements are incompatible .",
    "this difficulty has been bypassed in  @xcite for finite impulse response filters by using the control field of the preceding iteration to construct the fourier transform in order to satisfy spectral constraints . here",
    "we propose a similar algorithm but with a modified electric field .",
    "this means that we consider a standard monotonically convergent algorithm @xcite giving at each iteration a control field .",
    "in particular , only the energy of the field is penalized by the cost which does not depend on spectral constraints .",
    "we then apply a filter to this field to obtain a filtered control field .",
    "we next construct a new field as a linear combination of these two fields .",
    "the parameter of the linear combination is such that the algorithm remains strictly monotonic and the new control field is as close to the filtered field as possible .",
    "as expected , the filtering comes with the price of a slow down in convergence .",
    "we test the efficiency of this approach on molecular alignment which is a well - established topic in quantum control @xcite .",
    "molecular alignment has been optimized both experimentally @xcite and theoretically in different studies using genetic algorithms @xcite or optimal control theory @xcite .",
    "note that previous optimal control studies have not considered spectral constraints .",
    "the use of spectral constraints will allow one to construct new optimal control fields to reach a high alignment efficiency . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that aligned states are reached by rotational ladder climbing , i.e. , by successive rotational excitations .",
    "using spectral constraints , we determine an optimal control field that induces only particular rotational transitions .",
    "this shows how to guide the algorithm towards a particular mechanism . in a second step ,",
    "we consider spectral constraints corresponding to experimental pulse shaping techniques .",
    "our new algorithm leads to an optimal solution that could be implemented experimentally .",
    "the solutions determined from genetic algorithms in @xcite do not correspond to an optimal solution both maximizing the alignment and minimizing the energy of the control field .",
    "minimizing the intensity of the field can be interesting to avoid parasitic phenomena such as ionization .",
    "finally , we recall that in molecular alignment , due to the rapid oscillations of the laser field , the effect of the permanent dipole moment averages to zero and plays no role in the control of the dynamics .",
    "the interaction between the molecule and the electric field is therefore of order 2 .",
    "since the interaction is nonlinear , we use the monotonic algorithm introduced in @xcite with a non - standard cost of power 4 in the electric field to compute the optimal solution .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we present the problem of laser induced alignment of a linear molecule by non - resonant laser fields .",

    "is governed by the schrdinger equation . in a high - frequency approximation",
    "@xcite , this equation can be written as @xmath3|\\psi(t)\\rangle\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the rotational constant and @xmath5 is the difference between the parallel and perpendicular components of the polarizability tensor .",
    "we use atomic units unless otherwise specified . for numerical applications",
    "we consider the molecule @xmath6 with the following parameters @xmath7 @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 in atomic units @xcite .",
    "the optimal control problem is solved by a monotonically convergent algorithm .",
    "the goal of the control is to maximize the projection of the system at time @xmath11 onto a target state where @xmath11 is the duration of the control .",
    "the target state is taken as the state which maximizes the alignment in a reduced finite - dimensional hilbert space spanned by the @xmath12 first rotational levels @xcite .",
    "the reduced hilbert space is denoted @xmath13 . we assume in this paper that @xmath14 .",
    "a basis of the hilbert space is given by the spherical harmonics @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in case of pure state systems at a temperature @xmath18 , the target state @xmath19 is simply the eigenvector of maximum eigenvalue of the projection of the operator @xmath20 onto @xmath13 . the optimal control of molecular orientation and alignment has been considered in a series of articles @xcite .",
    "the novelty of our approach lies in the fact that we will consider in addition spectral constraints which leads to new optimal control fields . in other words",
    ", this means that there exists no unique optimal control field to reach a given target state and that it is possible to select an optimal solution via spectral constraints .",
    "due to the interaction of order 2 between the system and the field , we use the algorithm introduced in @xcite with a cost which is quartic in the field .",
