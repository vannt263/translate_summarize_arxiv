    "the scattered electron ( @xmath3 ) and kaon ( @xmath4 ) were measured in coincidence using the he s ( high resolution electron spectrometer ) and hks ( high resolution kaon spectrometer ) , dedicated electron and kaon spectrometers .",
    "the positions and angles of the scattered particles were measured with tracking detectors in the focal planes of each spectrometer and this information was used to reconstruct a missing mass .",

    "an aerogel erenkov detector and a water erenkov detector , used to reject @xmath5s and protons both on - line and off - line , played an important role in @xmath4 identification .",
    "these erenkov detectors were mounted close to the hks dipole magnet ( figure  [ fig : hks_setup ] ) in order to minimize loss of kaons due to decay .",
    "therefore , fringe field of up to @xmath2  5  g were observed in the region of the photomultipler tubes ( pmts ) on the erenkov detectors .",
    "it was expected that the @xmath4 identification efficiency would be reduced because of the effects of magnetic fields on pmt performance .",

    "as the kaon and proton velocities are below threshold in aerogel , @xmath6 and lighter particles can be rejected .",
    "the water erenkov detector is sensitive to all three particle species , but can distinguish protons and kaons by the difference in photon yields .",
    "we required that a on - line rejection ratio of the order of 1/100 for @xmath6 and @xmath15 to obtain the desired hypernuclear yield and signal to accidental background ratio .",
    "the goal of a high background rejection ratios must be balanced against the desire to maximize the efficiency of @xmath16 detection , particularly in the water erenkov detectors .",
    "this efficiency is determined by photo - electron collection efficiency of pmts , a property that is strongly affected by magnetic fields .",
    "a monte carlo simulation was done to estimate on - line background rejection ratios and kaon detection efficiency .",

    ", two layers of water erenkov cuts that rejects @xmath17 of protons will accept @xmath16 with a @xmath18 efficiency .",
    "however , when the mean number of photoelectrons is reduced by @xmath19 ( mean signal of 13 photoelectrons ) , the @xmath16 acceptance rate drops to @xmath20 for the same proton rejection ratio , directly reducing the yield for @xmath0 hypernuclei . given the limits on beam time , efforts to mitigate the effect of magnetic field on kaon detection efficiency are justified . in order to maximize the yield of @xmath0 hypernuclei and the signal to noise ratio , we set a goal that magnetic fields should not reduce photoelectron yields by more than @xmath21 .",

    "<S> aerogel and water erenkov detectors were employed to tag kaons for a @xmath0 hypernuclear spectroscopic experiment which used the @xmath1 reaction in experimental hall c at jefferson lab ( jlab e05 - 115 ) . </S>",
    "<S> fringe fields from the kaon spectrometer magnet yielded @xmath2  5 gauss at the photomultiplier tubes ( pmt ) for these detectors which could not be easily shielded . </S>",
    "<S> as this field results in a lowered kaon detection efficiency , we implemented a bucking coil on each photomultiplier tubes to actively cancel this magnetic field , thus maximizing kaon detection efficiency . </S>"
