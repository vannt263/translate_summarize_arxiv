    "some molecular cloud filaments are likely to be transitory objects , but others collapse further under gravity and fragment into star - forming cores .",
    "the resulting stars help to disperse the remaining parts of the filament through their ionizing radiation and winds / outflows .",
    "however , the efficiency of this process remains contentious : @xcite find that the ionizing flux from massive clusters forming at the base of strong filamentary accretion flows has little effect on the filaments , while @xcite find that massive stars are able to completely evacuate dense gas to 10pc distances .",
    "filaments located near regions of massive star formation can also be strongly affected by high speed shocks and winds .",
    "for example , the b59 filament in the pipe nebula is clearly being shaped by a wind from the nearby sco ob2 association @xcite .",
    "similarly , the winds and radiation from the ob stars in the cyg  ob2 and cyg  ob9 associations appear to be affecting the molecular clouds of the cyg  x complex @xcite , while @xcite suggest that stellar wind driven compression is consistent with the kinematics and structure of the co gas in orion  a and orion  b. winds may also play a part in disrupting molecular clouds , such as the rosette nebula @xcite .",

    "an adiabatic shock striking a non - magnetized filament represents the most basic idealized scenario of a shock - filament interaction .",
    "the interaction depends on five parameters : 1 ) the mach number of the shock , @xmath2 ; 2 ) the density contrast of the filament , @xmath3 ; 3 ) the filament aspect ratio ; 4 ) the orientation of the filament ; 5 ) the ratio of specific heats , @xmath4 . as no physical scales",

    ", we can expect mach - scaling to also hold ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so our high mach number calculations will be representative of any other high mach number simulation .",
    "our idealized filament is assumed to have a cylindrical centre , of length @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the filament radius , which is capped by a hemisphere at each end ( see , e.g. , fig .  [",
    "fig : m10c2l8s_xy_xz_montage ] ) .",
    "we choose this definition so that spherical clouds have @xmath8 .",
    "the total length of the filament is @xmath9 , and the ratio of the lengths of its major and minor axes is @xmath10 .",
    "the filament s orientation is specified by the angle @xmath11 , which is the angle between its major - axis and the shock _",
    "surface_. our setup is clearly idealized , not least because observations of actual filaments in molecular clouds show a great deal of sub - structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , and may be composed of multiple strands of gas .    nevertheless , this description is adequate for our purposes and allows us to investigate how the interaction changes as @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath12 , and @xmath11 are varied .",
    "the filament is assumed to have soft edges over about 10 per cent of its radius ( we adopt @xmath13 in keeping with our earlier work , cf .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "filaments in molecular clouds with a plummer - like density profile are like soft - edged clouds and we can expect that instabilities will take relatively longer to develop ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the filament is also in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings which have a mass density of @xmath14 .",
    "the first numerical studies of a planar adiabatic shock striking a single isolated spherical cloud were published in the 1970s .",
    "the nature of the interaction changes with the specific values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the cloud s density profile , but in all cases the cloud is initially compressed and then re - expands .",
    "vorticity is deposited at the surface of the cloud , and the cloud is subject to numerous dynamical instabilities , including kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) , rayleigh - taylor ( rt ) and richtmyer - meshkov ( rm ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the vorticity deposition and growth of kh instabilities is strongest when the cloud has sharp edges .",
    "the interaction is more gentle at lower mach numbers and for clouds with soft edges ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the cloud is more rigid , and is better able to resist the passage of the shock , as @xmath3 increases ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for all but weak shocks",
    ", the interaction is characterized by a series of shocks and rarefaction waves moving through the cloud which cause the cloud to reverberate - at some moments in time the cloud is pancaked , while at other moments the cloud becomes hollow and `` voided '' .",
    "shocks leaving the cloud introduce reflected rarefaction waves into the cloud , and shocks into the external medium .",
    "rarefaction waves within the cloud which reach the cloud boundary introduce a transmitted rarefaction wave into the external medium and a reflected shock which moves back into the cloud .    for relatively sharp - edged clouds , the cloud lifetime , @xmath15 , defined as",
    "when material from the core of the cloud is well mixed with the ambient material , is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the growth - timescale for the most disruptive , long - wavelength , kh instabilities @xcite . at high mach numbers and for @xmath18 , this is equivalent to @xmath19 . in 3d simulations ,",
    "non - axisymmetric instabilities develop @xcite , but for sharp - edged and reasonably sharp - edged clouds these do not significantly affect either the cloud lifetime or its acceleration @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that the break - up of the vortex ring in 3d experiments and simulations led to significant differences in the hollowing or `` voiding '' of the cloud compared to 2d simulations .",
    "however , @xcite showed that 2d axisymmetric and fully 3d simulations evolve almost identically until the late stages of the interaction , and put this contradiction down to the different numerical codes and initial conditions used by @xcite .",
    "while the hydrodynamical nature of the interaction of a shock with a spherical cloud is now well understood , very little work exists in the current literature on how the interaction changes when the cloud is not spherical .",
    "@xcite were amongst the first to look into this when they investigated the interaction of a shock with a cloud with an aspect ratio of 3:1 ( see their  sec 9.1 ) .",
    "their calculation was in 2d axisymmetry with the long - axis of the cloud aligned with the direction of propagation of the shock ( so the `` filament '' was hit from one end ) .",
    "they introduced a modified cloud crushing timescale ( @xmath20 , their eq .",
    "9.2 ) and found reasonably good agreement with the spherical case when comparing as a function of @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , @xcite noted that their main conclusions were unaffected by modest changes in the initial shape of the cloud .",
    "@xcite conducted some of the first 3d shock - cloud simulations in order to investigate how the interaction depends on the shape of the cloud .",
    "their use of 3d allowed arbitrary orientations of the cloud relative to the shock , thus avoiding the restrictions in @xcite s work .",
    "they instead noted that the nature of the interaction _ is _ quite different for spherical and prolate clouds : an aligned prolate cloud does not form a vortex ring , and accelerates faster than a spherical cloud , whereas an inclined prolate cloud is `` spun around '' and instabilities develop differently .",
    "they further found that the mixing rate of a prolate cloud is much faster than a spherical cloud of the same mass as a result of the higher surface - to - volume ratio of the cloud . in both of their calculations",
    "an axial ratio of 2:1 was adopted .",
    "to our knowledge , there exists no other dedicated numerical study of shocks striking prolate or filamentary clouds .",
    "the current work therefore extends the investigations of @xcite and @xcite to interactions where the aspect ratio of the cloud and its density contrast are greater .",
    "our work builds on recent spherical - cloud simulations where the dependence of the interaction with a shock was explored for a variety of density contrasts and shock mach numbers @xcite .",
    "the calculations were performed on a 3d xyz cartesian grid using the mg eulerian adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) hydrodynamic code @xcite .",
    "the normal eulerian equations are solved for conservation of mass , momentum and energy : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 = 0 , \\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the mass density , @xmath25 is the velocity , @xmath26 is the total energy density , and @xmath27 is the thermal pressure .",
    "mg uses piece - wise linear cell interpolation and solves the riemann problem at cell interfaces to obtain the conserved fluxes for the time update .",
    "a linear solver is used for most cases , with the code switching to an exact solver when there is a large difference between the two states .",
    "the flux update occurs for all directions simultaneously .",
    "the time integration proceeds first with a half time - step to obtain fluxes at this point .",
    "the conserved variables are then updated over the full time - step .",
    "the code is thus 2@xmath28-order accurate in space and time .",
    "the two coarsest levels ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) cover the whole computational domain , and finer cells are added or removed as needed .",
    "steep gradients in the fluid variables , such as at shocks or contact discontinuities , cause the mesh to be more refined than in more uniform regions .",
    "each level is generated from its predecessor by doubling the number of computational grid cells in each spatial direction .",
    "this technique enables the generation of fine grids in regions of high spatial and temporal variation , and conversely , relatively coarse grids where the flow field is numerically smooth .",
    "values for newly created cells are obtained by linear interpolation from the coarser level . to maintain accuracy",
    ", the solution in finer grid cells overwrites that in coarser cells , and flux corrections are applied at coarse - fine boundaries .",
    "double refinements are not allowed .",
    "refinement is performed on a cell - by - cell basis and is controlled by the difference in the solutions on the coarser grids . in this work",
    "only the difference in density is compared , and cells are marked for refinement if @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the density in the fine cell and @xmath33 is the interpolated density from the coarser cell , _ before _ the solution in the coarse cell has been overwritten by that in the finer cells . in this way the refinement algorithm really is comparing an error . in all of our calculations",
    "the @xmath29 grid has a cell width of @xmath34 , so that calculations with 32 cells across the filament semi - minor axis on the finest grid ( henceforth @xmath35 ) use 7 grid levels in total ( @xmath29 to @xmath36 ) .    in this work",
    "we conduct a purely hydrodynamic study , and ignore the effects of magnetic fields , thermal conduction , cooling and self - gravity .",
    "all calculations were perfomed for an ideal gas with @xmath18 and are adiabatic .",
    "our calculations are thus scale - free and can be easily converted to any desired physical scales .",
    "an advected scalar is used to distinguish between cloud and ambient material , and thus to track the ablation and mixing of the cloud , and the cloud s acceleration by the passage of the shock and subsequent exposure to the post - shock flow .",
    "the filament is initially centered at the grid origin @xmath37 while the shock is located at @xmath38 .",
    "the grid has zero gradient conditions on each boundary and is set large enough so that the filament is well - dispersed and mixed into the post - shock flow before the shock reaches the downstream boundary .",
    "the grid extent is dependent on @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and the filament orientation and is noted in table  [ tab : gridextent ] .",
    "note that we do not impose any symmetry constraints on the interaction , unlike the earlier work of @xcite .",
    "we define motion in the direction of shock propagation as `` axial '' ( the shock propagates along the x - axis ) , while motion perpendicular to this ( in the y and z directions ) is termed `` radial '' or `` transverse '' .",

    "* ) . however , it is not clear whether clouds can be accelerated by the ram pressure of the hot wind to the observed distances and velocities .",
    "for instance , @xcite find that clouds are completely disrupted by their interaction with a wind by the time they travel @xmath203 , and that it is therefore very difficult to explain the 100kpc distances at which cool gas is seen from nearby galaxies .",
    "they also find that clouds are accelerated to only very small fractions ( @xmath204 ) of the wind speed . on the other hand",

    "an obvious question is whether filaments as opposed to spherical clouds can alleviate some of these issues .",
    "the current paper indicates that @xmath152 varies little with filament length , and that side - on or nearly - side on filaments accelerate at approximately the same rate as spherical clouds ( @xmath152 is within @xmath207% ) . for longish filaments oriented nearly end - on ( @xmath208 ) ,",
    "@xmath115 can be a factor of 2 longer .",

    "the average displacement of the filament in the downstream direction @xmath212 at @xmath210 is noted in table  [ tab : results ] .",
    "some trends are worth noting .",
    "firstly , @xmath213 roughly decreases with increasing @xmath11 ( e.g. , from a value of 21.2 for simulation _",
    "m10c2l8s _ to 11.9 for simulation _ m10c2l8o85 _ ) .",
    "second , @xmath213 increases with @xmath12 for sideways - on filaments ( e.g. , from 14.8 for _ m10c2l2s _ to 21.2 for _ m10c2l8s _ ) , and also increases with @xmath3 for @xmath0 , @xmath52 , sideways - on filaments ( from 17.6 for _ m10c1l8s _ to 28.6 for _ m10c3l8s _ ) .",
    "in fact , table  [ tab : results ] indicates that simulation _",
    "m10c3l8s _ has the highest value of @xmath213 ( @xmath214 ) at @xmath210 ( @xmath215 for this simulation ) .",
    "this filament travels nearly as far as the furthest distance reported by @xcite , where @xmath216 for their simulation _ m11.4v3000 _ ( @xmath217 ) at @xmath218 ( defined as the time when only 33% of the cloud mass is at or above the original density , which corresponds to @xmath219 in this simulation ) .",
    "however , the velocity of the cloud material differs markedly between our work and theirs .",
    "the core material in our simulation has @xmath220 whereas in their simulation their cloud has only reached a velocity of @xmath221 ( @xmath222 ) . at face level",
    "our results would seem to be more favourable compared to observations of galactic winds .",
    "however , it is hard to make a more direct comparison because of the different tracers used for the cloud ( @xmath116 in our work versus @xmath223 in their work ) , and a dedicated study is needed to investigate this issue further .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the hydrodynamic interaction of a shock with a filament .",
    "this extends previous investigations of a shock striking a spherical cloud ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to interactions with highly elongated clouds .",
    "two additional parameters are introduced : the length of the filament ( @xmath12 ) and its orientation to the shock ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we have performed 3d simulations in which these parameters are varied , with our main focus on a mach 10 shock interacting with a @xmath1 filament .",
    "our main conclusions are as follows :    1 .",
    "we find significant differences in the interaction as @xmath12 and @xmath11 are varied .",
    "in particular , we find that filaments with @xmath224 which are oriented at @xmath225 form 3 parallel rolls during the interaction , which move away from each other as the filament material mixes into the ambient flow . in sideways - on filaments , the filament material expands preferentially along its minor - axis and in the direction of shock propagation , and much less so along its major - axis .",
    "the nature of the interaction changes significantly with the initial obliquity of the filament .",
    "filaments oriented only slightly oblique to the shock surface ( at @xmath71 ) spill flow with high vorticity around the upstream end of the filament , while periodic vortex shedding occurs at the downstream end .",
    "their wakes are longer and less symmetrical . increasing the obliquity",
    "further ( @xmath128 ) supresses the 3-parallel rolls - instead the vortex ring which forms at the upstream end of the filament is the dominant flow feature and is the cause of the filament s fragmentation .",
    "filaments which are almost end - on to the shock ( @xmath127 ) suffer dramatic `` hollowing '' or `` voiding '' , followed by strong instabilities at their upstream end .",
    "destruction occurs by the time that the transmitted shock reaches the back of the filament .",
    "sideways - on filaments initially lose mass more quickly , but since they are also accelerated more quickly the final 20% of their mass loss occurs more gradually .",
    "filaments oriented at an angle of @xmath123 to the shock front lose mass more slowly than those at other orientations .",
    "even a small elongation from spherical can significantly change the destruction timescale .",
    "4 .   the rate at which the filaments lose mass shows less variance between different simulations when the time is normalized in terms of @xmath121 , the `` cloud crushing time '' for a spherical cloud of the same density contrast and equivalent mass .",
    "when normalized in terms of @xmath121 , side - on filaments are destroyed more quickly than spherical clouds due to their greater surface area to volume ratio .",
    "filaments which are oriented at an angle to the shock can obtain velocities of order 10% of the shock speed in directions perpendicular to the shock normal , for short periods of time .",
    "filaments which are closely aligned with the shock normal can actually be pushed in a different transverse direction than expected .",
    "the filament velocity dispersion varies very little with length or orientation , except for filaments with @xmath226 which have their long - axis within @xmath64 of the shock normal .",
    "there does not seem to be any significant difference in @xmath227 with filament orientation , despite clear differences in @xmath144 . 7 .",
    "sideways - on filaments have a lower value of @xmath115 ( i.e. they accelerate faster ) .",
    "@xmath115 can vary by a factor of 2 or so due to changes in the orientation of the filament : @xmath115 increases as the filament orientation moves from sideways - on towards end - on , but the variation is not completely monotonic , and there is a slight reduction as the filament becomes nearly end - on .",
    "@xmath117 shows similar behaviour .",
    "the nature of the interaction mirrors that of spherical cloud interactions as @xmath2 and @xmath3 are varied .",
    "the interaction is much less violent at lower mach numbers , and both @xmath228 and @xmath229 increase .",
    "filaments with a lower density contrast are less able to resist the shock and their immersion in the post - shock flow , and are rapidly accelerated towards the postshock speed .",
    "filaments with a higher density contrast are accelerated more slowly and are subject to stronger instabilities .    in a companion paper",
    "@xcite we examine the effect of a magnetic field on shock - filament interactions , and in future work we will explore the effects of additional physics , such as radiative cooling , and the interaction with a wind rather than a shock .",
