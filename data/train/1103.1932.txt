    "quasar absorption lines ( qals ) provide us a unique tool to study abundances , physical conditions and kinematics of gas in a wide variety of astrophysical environments . many of the early detected qals are associated systems with redshifts close to the quasar emission redshifts ( e.g. , burbidge et al .",
    "1966 ; schmidt 1966 ) .",
    "the discovery of intervening qals was first reported by bahcall et al .",
    "bahcall ( 1968 ) developed the first systematic method for identifying absorption systems on quasar spectra .",
    "to date , thousands of qals have been detected ( e.g. , nestor et al . 2005 ; prochter et al .",
    "2006 ) thanks to the huge quasar database from sdss ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the existence of dust content in quasar damped ly@xmath4 absorbers ( dlas ) was first detected through reddening measurements of quasar continuum spectra ( fall et al .",
    "1989 ; pei et al .",
    "it was later confirmed by measurements of depletion of different metal elements in the gas phase onto dust grains ( e.g. , pettini et al .",
    "1994 , 1997 , 1999 ; lu et al . 1996 ) .",
    "murphy & liske ( 2004 ) further investigated dust reddening of dlas on background quasars by comparing the spectral index distribution of a sample of 70 dlas at @xmath6 to that of a large control sample , but they found no evidence for dust reddening .",
    "vladilo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) revisited dust reddening of dlas by deriving the color excess of background quasars , and they found significant color excess caused by the foreground absorbers in their sample of 248 dlas at @xmath7 .",
    "by studying the average extinction curves on quasar spectra with mg  ii absorption lines , york et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found clear evidence for presence of dust in intervening absorption systems with @xmath8 .",
    "recently , mnard et al . ( 2008 ) confirmed dust reddening in a much larger absorber sample with nearly 7000 strong mg  ii absorption systems at @xmath9 .",
    "all these dust reddening studies show that , on average , the dust grain size distribution of quasar absorption systems is similar to that of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; pei 1992 )",
    ". the extinction curve does not show presence of the broad bump around 2175- found in the milky way ( mw ) interstellar clouds ( e.g. , stecher 1965 ; savage & mathis 1979 ; fitzpatrick 1989 ) .",
    "the 2175- dust feature has been found in a handful of local galaxies , where the reddening law of their inter - stellar medium ( ism ) can be studied spatially ( keel et al .",
    "the 2175- bumps in the mw extinction curves appear to be the strongest among all of the known galaxies .",
    "the strength of the bump in the extinction curves from the large magellanic clouds 2 ( lmc2 ) supershell ( near the 30 dor star formation region ; gordon et al .",
    "2003 ) is quite moderate while the bumps are nearly absent in the smc extinction curves .",
    "it is very likely that the mw - like dust is a minor population among ism dust in the universe .",
    "therefore , the 2175- dust extinction bumps can not be recovered by using any average extinction curves method .",
    "the detections of the 2175- extinction bump in individual quasar absorption systems were well reviewed by wang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . recently ,",
    "several new detections have been reported ( e.g. , srianand et al .",
    "2008 ; noterdaeme et al . 2009 ; zhou et al .",
    "all the recent ones were detected on sdss spectra by comparing the reddened quasar spectrum with the sdss composite quasar spectrum ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ) . in nearly parallel efforts ,",
    "the analysis of gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) afterglow spectra has also revealed several positive detections of 2175- dust feature from intervening absorbers and from gas in the grb host galaxies ( e.g. , ellison et al .",

    "in this paper , we report detections of 39 2175- dust extinction bump candidates associated with strong mg  ii absorption line systems on quasar spectra in sdss dr3 based on the fm90 parameterization modeling of optical / uv extinction curves .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in  2 we describe the parameterization of optical / uv extinction curves ; in  3 we introduce the procedures of searching for 2175- absorbers in a strong mg  ii absorber sample from sdss dr3 and report 39 candidates ; in  4 further investigations and follow - up observations in future are discussed ; more relevant discussions and a short summary are given in  5 .",
    "previous studies by cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ; ccm ) show that most of the variation in the mw extinction curves can be described as an empirical relationship based on a single parameter , @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath11 is a rough measurement of an average dust grain size , the @xmath11 dependent ccm relationship gives a physical basis for the variation in the mw extinction curves .",
    "however , the width and the peak position of the galactic 2175- extinction bump are uncorrelated with @xmath11 ( see figure 10 in cardelli et al . 1989 and figure 20 in fitzpatrick & massa 2007 ) .",
    "this indicates that the carriers of bumps are likely independent of the dust grains responsible for @xmath11 variations .",
    "thus , it is necessary to use an independent parameterization model to properly describe the 2175- dust extinction bump .",
    "we use a parameterized extinction curve ( fm90 parameterization ) constituted by a linear component and a drude component to describe the optical / uv extinction curve in the rest frame of an absorber on sdss spectra for quasar absorption line systems .",
    "the linear component is used to model the underlying extinction , while the drude component is used to model the possible 2175- extinction bump .",
    "the parameterized extinction curve is written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 .",
    "and @xmath14 is a drude profile , which is expressed as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 is the peak position and fwhm of the drude profile , respectively .",
    "dust reddened sdss quasar spectra are modeled by reddening the sdss composite quasar spectrum with a parameterized extinction curve in the rest frame of the absorber of interest .",
    "our aim is to unveil the 2175- absorption feature associated with absorption line systems on quasar spectra .",
    "here we have no intention to derive the absolute extinction curve . instead , our derived curve is a relative extinction curve without being normalized by e ( ) .",
    "therefore , we can not precisely extract the conventionally defined extinction parameters , such as @xmath18 , e ( ) and @xmath11 , from the derived extinction curve .",
    "however , all the features of 2175- absorption bump are preserved in our derived curve .",
    "the strength of bump can be measured by the area of the bump @xmath19 , which can be interpreted as rescaling the integrated apparent optical depth of the bump absorption ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "in this section , we present the procedures for searching for 2175- extinction bumps associated with strong mg  ii absorption lines on sdss dr3 quasar spectra .",
    "the full sample of strong mg  ii absorption line systems in sdss dr3 was compiled by prochter et al .",
    "it contains 7,421 confirmed mg  ii absorption systems with the rest equivalent width refers to the rest equivalent width of the mg  ii @xmath212796 transition ] @xmath22 1.0  , spanning a redshift range of 0.35@xmath232.3 .",
    "we applied two redshift criteria to select spectra for searching for the 2175- extinction bumps on them .",
    "we restricted the redshifts of mg  ii absorption lines to within 1.0@xmath24 to allow the potential 2175- extinction feature to lie completely within the sdss spectrograph operation wavelength region ( 3,8009,200 ; york et al .",
    "we also set an upper limit of z=2.1 for the background quasar redshifts to avoid the ly@xmath4 forest line contamination in the potential 2175- bump features . the final sample which meets both criteria has a total of 2,951 strong mg  ii absorbers .",
    "the spectroscopic and photometric data in this work are extracted from the sdss dr7 database ( abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) to take advantage of the new photometric and spectrophotometric calibrations .",
    "these calibrations are critical for determining the overall shape of spectra .",
    "we adopted the redshifts and @xmath25s of mg  ii absorption lines measured by prochter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) based on sdss dr3 spectra . although the wavelength calibration has been updated in sdss dr7 , the measurement of absorption redshift in prochter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is still adequate for this work since the width of expected 2175- extinction bumps are so broad that our result is not sensitive to the accuracy of absorption redshifts .",
    "the error of @xmath25s is dominated by systematic uncertainty due to continuum fitting and contamination by absorption lines from other redshift absorbers and the earth s atmosphere .",
    "the expected typical error on @xmath25s is 0.20.3  ( prochter et al .",
    "we measured the @xmath25s for a few mg  ii absorbers by using their dr7 spectra to examine whether the new calibrations affect the measurement of @xmath25 .",
    "our results are consistent with the values reported in prochter et al .",
    "( 2006 ) within the expected error ( 0.20.3  ) .",
    "therefore , we take the @xmath25s measured by prochter et al . ( 2006 ) and put conservative errorbars ( 0.3  ) on the measurements uniformly in this paper .",
    "we assumed that the quasar spectra are free of contamination of starlight from the host galaxy because the quasars in this work have redshifts @xmath26 .",
    "all the photometric and spectroscopic sdss data are corrected for galactic reddening by using the dust map of schlegel et al .",

    "there are two main considerations to update it : ( 1 ) the change of spectral calibration method between edr and dr7 ; ( 2 ) the change of quasar selection criteria .",

    "the simulation begins with the selection of a control sample of sdss quasar spectra at the similar redshift to the quasar of interest . in this work , we selected the control quasar spectra with an i band signal - to - noise ratio of snr@xmath315 and emission redshifts in the range of @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the emission redshift of the studied quasar , in the sdss dr7 database ( schneider et al .",

    "the bump candidates are labeled with filled color circles .",
    "their bump strengths are much weaker than those of the mw bumps on average , but similar to the lmc2 supershell bumps . among the 6 previous bump detections on sdss quasar spectra , there are two strong mw - like bumps : the 2175- absorber toward the quasar j100713.68 + 285348.4 at z @xmath0 0.9 ( zhou et al . 2010 ) and the other one toward the quasar j145907.19 + 002401.2 at z @xmath0 1.4 ( jiang et al .",
    "2010b ) .",
    "figure 5 also shows that the strengths of low confidence candidates ( filled green circles ) increase with the increasing bump widths .",
    "this trend can be explained naturally with the simulation technique . for a spectrum without a real extinction feature in the control sample ,",
    "the fitted bump strength is actually an integration of random fluctuations over the wavelength range covered by it . in principle",
    ", a broader integration makes the resultant fitted bump strengths to appear stronger .",
    "therefore , a broad bump must be stronger than a narrow one in order to be significantly distinguished from random fluctuations of quasar spectra . in other word , the detection threshold is higher for broader bumps .",
    "we also notice that some rejected bump candidates are even stronger than some of the confidence candidates with the same widths .",
    "this is because that the distribution of fitted bump strengths in the simulations is also dependent on x@xmath37 , which is the center of the bump in the rest frame of quasar emissions .",
    "since we mask the region with strong emission lines when fitting quasar spectra , the bumps on / near broad emission lines can not be well constrained .",
    "the deviation of the resultant strength distribution becomes larger when the bump center is close to a strong broad emission line .",
    "therefore , the detection threshold depends on x@xmath37 as well as the width @xmath17 . in summary , every bump candidate needs to be analyzed individually to derive its statistical significance .    in order to investigate how x@xmath37 and @xmath17 affect the detection threshold quantitatively , we designed a set of simulations by using all the quasar spectra with redshifts in the range of @xmath38 in sdss dr7 .",
    "we conducted simulations for a fairly wide range of x@xmath37 and @xmath17 listed in table 6 .",
    "first , we collected all the spectra which could fully contain a 2175- bump with the specified pair of x@xmath37 and @xmath17 as a sample .",
    "we then derived the distribution of fitted bump strengths by fitting every quasar spectrum with a composite quasar spectrum reddened by a fm09 parameterized optical / uv extinction curve .",
    "the resultant distribution of strengths is fitted with a gaussian profile .",
    "basically the procedures are almost the same as those of significance simulations described above , except for the selection of the quasar sample . in table 6",
    ", we list the 3@xmath5 and 5@xmath5 detection thresholds for different pairs of x@xmath37 and @xmath17 . figure 6 illustrates the simulation results .",
    "the dotted spectra are sdss quasar composite spectra redshifted to @xmath39",
    ". then we redden the composite spectra by an extinction bump of a x@xmath37 and @xmath17 pair with the corresponding 5 @xmath5 threshold strength .",
    "we do not apply any underlying linear extinction on composite spectra .",
    "the spectra for different x@xmath37s are organized in separated panels ; the spectra in the same panel are for increasing @xmath17 from top to bottom .    in figure 7 , we study the correlationship between bump strength of the candidates and @xmath25 of mg  ii@xmath212796 and the correlationship between strength and relative color @xmath40 of the background quasar .",
    "the color of quasars is redshift dependent , since the broad emission features on underlying continuum move in / out the photometric passbands at different redshift ( richards et al .",
    "richards et al .",
    "( 2003 ) introduced a relative color @xmath40 to determine the underlying continuum color of quasars by subtracting the median colors of quasars at the redshift of each quasar from the measured colors of each quasar .",
    "the distribution of relative colors should be a gaussian , assuming a gaussian distribution of power - law spectral indices of quasars .",
    "however , @xmath40 shows a significant asymmetric tail to the red end .",
    "the objects in this tail are reddened by dust ( richards et al .",
    "figure 7a illuminates the distribution of the 2,951 redshift selected mg  ii absorbers and the 39 2175- absorber candidates in the space of @xmath25 and @xmath40 .",
    "the reddened tail of the distribution of @xmath40 for the mg  ii absorber sample is prominent .",
    "the average @xmath40 of detected 2175- absorbers is 0.39 and all of them have relative colors @xmath40s of @xmath34 0 .",
    "the 2175- absorbers should be dusty since the 2175- dust extinction feature is already detected on their spectra .",
    "however , about one third of our confidence candidates are not located in the dust reddening tail in figure 7a .",
    "it could be explained if the background quasars of these relative blue 2175- absorbers have very flat spectral index intrinsically .",
    "another possible explanation is that the underlying linear extinction curves of these relative blue candidates are fairly flat in uv bands . in this work , the linear component of fm90 extinction curve accounts for the variation of the intrinsic quasar spectral slopes as well as the dust reddening",
    "this is different from the fitting method used by srianand et al ( 2008 ) and noterdaeme et al .",
    "both of them used the average mw and lmc2 extinction curves when reddening the sdss composite quasar spectrum . on these average curves , the strength of the 2175- bump and the slope of the linear component",
    "are fixed together .",
    "a quasar spectrum possessing a strong bump feature has to have a very red @xmath40 in their cases .",
    "otherwise , the quasar spectrum can not be fitted with their method . in figure 7b , we plot the bump strength of our candidates versus @xmath40 of their background quasars .",
    "we indeed obtain several fairly strong bumps in the region of small positive @xmath40 .",
    "no correlation appears in this plot .",
    "another difference between our fitting method and the average mw extinction curve method is that the width of 2175- bump is free .",
    "the width of the bump is fixed in srianand et al ( 2008 ) and noterdaeme et al .",
    "( 2009 ) to the width of average mw bump ( 0.922@xmath41m@xmath42 ) or the width of average lmc2 bump ( 0.945@xmath41m@xmath42 ) .",
    "however , the widths of known mw and lmc2 bumps distribute widely from 0.5@xmath41m@xmath42 to 2.7@xmath41m@xmath42 .",
    "it is reasonable to expect some broad bump features appearing on quasar spectra .",
    "these spectra can not be well fitted by their method ( e.g. , the 2175- absorber toward j145907.19 + 002401.2 in jiang et al .",
    "the bump strengths of our candidates are plotted versus @xmath25 is figure 7c .",
    "we found no correlationship between them .",
    "in this paper , we use the sdss composite quasar spectrum to model the `` dereddened '' spectrum of background quasar .",
    "this approach has been applied by most of the researchers who study the 2175- bumps on sdss quasar spectra ( e.g. , srianand et al .",
    "2008 ; noterdaeme et al . 2009 ; zhou et al .",
    "composite quasar spectrum serves as a good approximation for the individual quasar spectrum in these works .",
    "however , the quasar spectra varies a lot in the spectral slope of nonthermal continuum , the width of broad emission lines , the intensity of broad emission lines .",
    "the most important problem is the pseudo - continuum due to fe  ii broad emission lines while investigating the 2175- absorption bumps .",
    "the fluctuation of pseudo - continuum can mimic a broad absorption bump feature on a quasar spectrum in some cases ( e.g. , pitman 2000 ; noterdaeme et al .",
    "2009 ) . assuming the fluctuation is purely random",
    ", researchers tried to rule out the fake bumps in statistical ways ( e.g. , noterdaeme et al .",

    "we use the same statistical method with jiang et al .",
    "2010b to gauge the significance of the 2175- bump candidates . in a conservative manner",
    ", we prefer to name the selected 39 2175- bumps in this work as candidates rather than detections .",
    "we think further investigation is necessary to rule out some of possible false detections .",
    "the spectrum fitting of continuum and emission lines of quasar has been widely studied by researchers interested in quasar emissions ( e.g. , boroson & green 1992 ; dong et al .",
    "2005 , 2008 ; wang et al .",
    "there are three main components in the model .",
    "the agn continuum is usually modeled with a power law ; the broad fe  ii multiplets ( pseudo - continuum ) is modeled with the uv fe  ii template , which was generated by tsuzuki et al .",
    "( 2006 ) based on their measurements of i zw1 ; the other emission lines are modeled with gaussians . for a reddened quasar ,",
    "an extinction curve needs to be considered in the model . in practice ,",
    "the fitting with this full model is fairly complicated . in most cases ,",
    "the fitting can not be solved .",
    "although it is difficult , the full model fitting provides us a possible tool to distinguish the real 2175- absorption bump with the pseudo - continuum due to broad fe  ii multiplets on a quasar spectrum .",
    "the high resolution and high s / n follow - up observations could enable us to attempt the full model fitting on the 2175- bump candidates .",
    "if succeed , the existence of bumps can be determined more firmly and their shape can be measured more precisely .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up observation may also reveal the chemical and physical natures of 2175- bump absorbers , such as metallicity , dust depletion , temperature , ionization state and density as well as velocity profile .",
    "srianand et al .",
    "( 2008 ) detected 21-cm absorption lines associated with two 2175- quasar absorbers .",
    "the 21-cm absorption is usually an indicator of cold dense gas clouds .",
    "jiang et al . ( 2010b ) measured the relative abundance of two strong 2175- absorbers and found the high dust depletion [ fe / zn]=-1.59 ( i.e. a characteristic of cold dense clouds in the mw ) in both of them .",
    "in addition , noterdaeme et al . ( 2009 ) measured a similar high dust depletion level ( [ fe / zn]=-1.47 ) of a 2175- absorber at @xmath43=1.64 toward the quasar sdss j160457.50 + 220300.5 and detected c  i and co absorption lines associated with this absorber .",
    "these are important clues to the cold ism origin of the 2175- dust absorption feature . however , the carrier of the 2175- bump is still not very clear ( e.g. draine 2003 and reference therein ) .",
    "the large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules , which have strong @xmath44 absorption in the 20002500  region , are proposed to be a promising candidate for the carrier of 2175- absorption ( li & draine 2001 ) . in figure 5 , we see a wide distribution of strengths and widths for the bumps observed in local galaxies",
    ". it could be caused by the varying size of pah molecules from one sightline to another .",
    "draine ( 2003 ) interpreted the observed variations in bump widths ( and small variations in peak positions ) of the galactic 2175-  extinction bump profile can result from differences in the pah mix .",
    "this difference can also affect the oscillator strength per molecule and lead to the deviation of bump strengths .",
    "the sdss dr7 database contains 105,783 quasar spectra ( schneider et al . 2010 ) . we expect to find more than 50 significant 2175- bumps associated with mg  ii absorption line systems by implementing the same searching strategy in this paper",
    ". another possible approach of searching for the 2175- extinction bump on quasar spectra is to compare the reddened quasar with a blue quasar template ( j. wang et al . , 2011 , in preparation ) .",
    "the blue quasar template is defined as the spectrum of an observed sdss blue quasar with similar width and strength of broad emission lines ( including the broad feii emission lines ) with the reddened quasar of interest .",
    "the only difference between the reddened quasar and its blue template is considered to be dust reddening .",
    "this idea is very similar to the method used to extract the extinction curves by comparing the spectrum of a reddened hot early - type star with a unreddened star having the same stellar type in the mw ( e.g. trunpler 1930 ; welty & fowler 1992 ) .",
    "this method may measure the 2175- bump on quasar spectrum more precisely when compared with the composite spectrum method since the emission lines are matched .",
    "however , the selection of blue quasar template needs to be studied carefully .",
    "dust extinction and reddening effects can change the magnitude and color of background quasars .",
    "it is very likely that some dust reddened quasars can not be recovered by the sdss quasar target selection algorithm ( richards et al . 2002 ) , which is mainly based on the sdss imaging magnitudes and colors .",
    "in addition to searching for 2175- absorbers in the current sdss quasar spectra database , we also plan to select the 2175- quasar absorber candidates in the sdss image database for follow - up spectroscopic observations in future .",
    "the wavelength coverage of sdss spectrum is from 3800  to 9200  .",
    "it allows us to detect galactic 2175- extinction feature up to redshift @xmath6 .",
    "the highest redshift for identified 2175- bump to date is @xmath45 , which was detected by prochaska et al .",
    "( 2009 ) using the afterglow optical / ir photometry of gamma - ray burst grb 080607 .",
    "another high redshift 2175- bump was detected by elasdttir et al .",
    "( 2009 ) on the afterglow optical spectrum of grb 070802 at @xmath46 .",
    "we are also studying the feasibility of using our method to search for high redshift 2175- bumps .",
    "the main difficulty to implement our method to high redshift bumps is that the random ly@xmath4 limit absorptions are present blueward of the ly@xmath4 emission line on the spectrum of quasar beyond @xmath47 .",
    "they make the spectrum fitting procedure more complicated .",
    "however , a further developed detection method for high redshift bumps would be very helpful for us to search for 2175- dust extinction bumps on the spectra of @xmath0160,000 quasars at redshifts @xmath48 from the sdss - iii s baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ; eisenstein et al .",
    "2011 ) in future .    in this paper",
    ", we searched for 2175- dust extinction bumps associated with strong mg  ii absorption lines on quasar spectra in sdss dr3 .",
    "the search results in 12 high confidence candidates with a 5@xmath5 level of statistical significance , 10 median confidence candidates with a 4@xmath5 level and 17 low confidence candidates with a 3@xmath5 level . the total number of 2175- bump detections have been largely increased by this work .",
    "follow - up observations may rule out some of possible false detections and reveal the physical and chemical natures of 2175- quasar absorbers .",
