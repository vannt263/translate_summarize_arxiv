    "this generalization leads to the following relation for the velocity of the stars moving on a circular orbit around the center of the galaxy @xmath198 where @xmath112 stands for the velocity of the star around the center of the presumed galaxy . examining the rotational curves of the spiral galaxies fig.[fig2 ] , we see that the constant asymptotic velocity can be approximated by @xmath199 in large scales . in these distances ,",
    "the first term of is small , thus implies @xmath200 is needed to describe the constant velocity of the within the borders of a typical spiral galaxy . the high precision measurement around the earth , however , requires @xmath201 therefore , discards and implies that @xmath202 has no chance to describe the flat rotational velocity curves of the spiral galaxies",
    ".    it is worth noting that the riemann scalar curvature in the solar system and around the earth satisfies @xmath203 while in the regime where the anomalous rotational curvature of the spiral galaxies happens , it satisfies @xmath204 where a galaxy with a central mass at order @xmath205 with the boundary of about @xmath206kpc is alleged . if we assume that a simple action in the form of a polynomial in terms of the riemann tensor dictates the dynamics of the space - time in both of the regimes given by and we observe that the value of @xmath38 will be needed to describe the anomalous flat rotational curve of the spiral galaxies is not in agreement with the accurate measurements of the space - time geometry around the earth , as illustrated in fig.[fig1 ] as well .",
    "we , however , lack experimental justification or observational data supporting this assumption .",
    "any functional of the riemann tensor squared , @xmath207=\\theta[r_{\\mu\\nu\\eta\\gamma}r^{\\mu\\nu\\eta\\gamma}]$ ] , which becomes sufficiently small for but constant for can be utilized to suggest the following phenomenological action for gravity : @xmath208~ ( r_{\\mu\\nu\\eta\\gamma}r^{\\mu\\nu\\eta\\gamma})^{\\frac{1}{2}})\\,,\\ ] ] which has a chance not only to be consistent with the solar system s data but meets as well .",
    "the exact solutions of precedes reaching a concrete conclusion on the validity of the above suggestion . addressing the exact solution of or",
    "a similar action in which @xmath209 is replaced with the gauss - bonnet lagrangian lays outside the scope of the current work .",
    "we have approximated the space - time geometry in the solar system by a ricci flat geometry , a geometry of vanishing ricci tensor .",
    "we have shown that a correction to the einstein action would ` non - trivially ' perturbs the space - time geometry around a ricci flat geometry in case the correction involves the riemann tensor per se .",
    "after that we have considered the simplest family of these corrections ; the corrections which are arbitrary functional of the riemann tensor s squared :    @xmath210    then we have computed the corrections to the schwarszchild black - hole in an asymptotically flat 4d geometry for a general @xmath211 .",
    "we have observed that @xmath1 gives rise to a constant anomalous acceleration for objects orbiting the sun onward the sun .",
    "this leaded us to the conclusion that @xmath2 would have covariantly resolved the pioneer anomaly if this value of @xmath3 had not contradicted with other observations .",
    "we have shown that the experimental bounds on @xmath4 becomes stronger in case we examine the deformation of the space - time geometry around objects lighter than the sun .",
    "we therefore have used the high precision measurements around the earth ( lageos and lunar laser ranging ) and have obtained a strong constraint on the corrections in the form of @xmath0 and in particular @xmath5 .",
    "it is interesting that the high precision measurements around the earth provide a strong constraint on the possible correction to the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "the high precision measurements around the earth requires @xmath6 , therefore , they refute the covariant resolution of the pioneer anomaly .",
    "so the pioneer anomaly can not be covariantly resolved within the general family of corrections we have considered .",
    "this supports the idea that the pioneer anomaly is on board systematic or due to non - gravitational effects .",
    "we also have noted that @xmath43 gives rise to an effective logarithmic gravitational potential .",
    "we have raised the question if @xmath43 may be useful in describing the anomalous flat rotational velocity curves of the spiral galaxies , before having proved that a simple correction in the form of @xmath43 is not either in agreement with the high precision measurements around the earth , or can not describe the flat rotational velocity curves of the spiral galaxies .",
    "i thank mohammad mehdi sheikh - jabbari and amir hajian for fruitful discussions .",
    "i thank mahmood exirifard for his sharp comments on the english structure and writing of the first version of the manuscript .",
    "i thank peter bender for informing me of the lageos and llr experiments by the criticism that he ruled out the prediction of the first version of this manuscript .",
    "i appreciate the comments and criticisms made by anonymous referees of cqg .",
    "there exists a debate in the literature on the consistency of @xmath212 for @xmath213 with the solar system tests , for example look at @xcite . in particular ref .",
    "@xcite claims that properly matching the metric inside and outside the sun rules out @xmath34 gravity .",
    "a sharp inspection of @xcite , however , reveals that @xcite has not properly studied the equations .",
    "this was also noticed by @xcite . in the following",
    "we would like to clarify why the conclusion of @xcite is not right in addition to demonstrating the source of this wrong conclusion .",
    "contracting the equations of motion of with the inverse of the metric yields @xmath214 where @xmath215 and the speed of light is set one .",
    "now let us define a new variable , @xmath216 , through @xmath217 .",
    "rewriting in terms of @xmath216 and rearranging the terms yields @xmath218 note that the einstein - hilbert gravity holds @xmath219 .",
    "we can obtain the order of magnitude of @xmath220 for the sun by @xmath221 where @xmath222 is the radius of the sun . knowing the order of magnitude of @xmath220 ,",
    "we can obtain the order of magnitude for deviation from @xmath219 in : @xmath223 where @xmath224 is the schwarszchild radius associated to the mass of the sun .",
    "using @xmath225 , @xmath226 and @xmath227 , the order of magnitude of the deviation from @xmath219 in reads @xmath228 note that the order of magnitude of the coffiecient in the front of @xmath229 and similar terms in is @xmath230 .",
    "therefore even the non - homogeneouty of the matter s distribution in the sun does not produce a significant deviation from @xmath219 inside the sun .",
    "recalling that the einstein - hilbert gravity holds @xmath219 besides extraordinarily small deviation from @xmath219 , we conclude that the einstein - hilbert action quite - perfectly describes the physics in and outside the sun for .",
    "now let us inspect what leads @xcite to the wrong conclusion .",
    "@xcite defines a function by @xmath231 which we refer to as the c - function .",
    "the authors then take granted that the c - function encodes the deviation from the vacuum solution even outside the matter s distribution .",
    "this means that the authors fail to realize that the c - function can be identically zero outside the matter s distribution . in other words",
    "the deviation from the vacuum solution might be encoded in other scalars rather the ricci scalar or equivalently the c - function .",
    "they than rewrite in terms of the c - function @xmath232 before approximating it to @xmath233 it then appears that the authors assume that the c - function and its derivatives are continuous on the surface of the sun .",
    "but in the enistein - hilbert gravity what remains continuous on the boundaries are the metric and its first derivatives .",
    "for example we know that the ricci scalar or equivalently the c - function is not continuous on the boundary .",
    "therefore instead of choosing c - function as what @xcite has chosen , we must choose it in the following way      the above choice means that within the electrostatic approximation to the equations - - , the surface of the sun effectively plays the role of a conducting surface accommodating some amount of ` charge ' that completely cloaks the ` charge ' inside the sun .",
    "setting @xmath235 outside the sun leads to the schawrszchild metric in the solar system which is in agreement with observation .",
    "therefore 1/r gravity is not ruled out at least due to reason addressed in @xcite .",
