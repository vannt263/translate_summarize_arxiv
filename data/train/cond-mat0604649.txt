    "these units are not unique but always chosen to be as small as possible .",
    "the reason for this is the desire to obtain maximally independent or unconnected units which will host collections of localized magnons without interaction , the so - called @xmath3-lm states .",
    "+ the lm states yield several spectacular effects near saturation field : due to these states at zero temperature there is a macroscopic magnetization jump to saturation in spin systems hosting lm states @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one observes a magnetic field induced spin - peierls instability @xcite , and , last but not least , a residual ground - state entropy at the saturation field @xcite .",
    "whereas huge ground - state manifolds as such are not unusual in frustrated magnetism @xcite , exact degeneracies in _ quantum _ frustrated magnets are not so common .",

    "( b ) : :    does the set of lm states span the whole subspace of ground states or    are there more ground states than those of lm type ?    the answers to these questions are , on the one hand , of general interest , since they provide exact statements about non - trivial quantum many body systems , but are , on the other hand , crucial for the contribution of the lm states to the thermodynamics at low temperatures and magnetic fields close to the saturation field . however ,",

    "<S> at the magnetic saturation field , certain frustrated lattices have a class of states known as  localized multi - magnon states \" as exact ground states . </S>",
    "<S> the number of these states scales exponentially with the number @xmath0 of spins and hence they have a finite entropy also in the thermodynamic limit @xmath1 provided they are sufficiently linearly independent . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we present rigorous results concerning the linear dependence or independence of localized magnon states and investigate special examples . for large classes of spin lattices including what we called the orthogonal type and the isolated type as well as the kagom , the checkerboard and the star lattice we have proven linear independence of all localized multi - magnon states . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> the pyrochlore lattice provides an example of a spin lattice having localized multi - magnon states with considerable linear dependence . </S>"
