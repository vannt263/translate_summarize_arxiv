    "time - domain surveys in various wavelengths have been making mysterious new transients discoveries .",
    "these results are remarkable , and newly discovered transients are revolutionizing our knowledge of astronomy and astrophysics .",
    "the hard x - ray survey of _ swift _ and related multi wavelength follow - ups found one unusual transient to be the tidal disruption of a star by a dormant super massive black hole @xcite .",
    "this discovery confirmed tidal disruption events as actual stellar phenomena .",
    "other candidates for tidal disruption flares have been reported by optical imaging surveys @xcite .",
    "optical untargeted imaging surveys have also been discovering new stellar explosions .",
    "the discovery of sn2007bi has provided possibly the first evidence of pair - instability supernova ( sne ) , which are thought to be triggered by very massive stars @xcite .",
    "ultra - luminous sne are another recent discoveries @xcite .",
    "these transients are characterized by high optical luminosities reaching peak absolute magnitudes of @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "because of their luminosity , they could possibly be detected with an 8-m class telescope even at higher redshift such as @xmath9 @xcite .    several other optical transients",
    "are theoretically predicted but have not yet been observationally confirmed .",
    "one of them is an orphan grb afterglow that is thought to arise as a natural consequence of grb jets @xcite .",
    "however , because of the limited sensitivity of current optical equipment , there is no promising candidate of orphan grb yet . to extend the redshift frontiers of these transients and to search for transients undetected by optical surveys",
    ", we performed systematic transient searches and classification using a deep survey conducted by subaru / suprime - cam . in this letter",
    ", we report the discovery of an unusually luminous long - duration optical transient . throughout this paper ,",
    "magnitudes are in the ab system .",
    "we obtained available optical imaging data sets of the subaru deep field ( sdf ; @xcite ) .",
    "the original sdf survey was conducted from 2002 to 2003 with 5 broad - band filters@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 and two narrow - band filters , nb816 and nb921 using the suprime - cam attached to the subaru telescope .",
    "the 3 @xmath13 limiting magnitudes of the final stacked images reach @xmath1428.45 , @xmath1527.74 , @xmath1627.80 , @xmath1=27.43 , and @xmath2=26.62 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the field was also monitored using the same camera before and after the sdf survey for various purpose with several programs .",
    "the total temporal coverage is @xmath17 d from 2001 to 2008 .",
    "although the observations for @xmath10 and @xmath11 were made by a single - epoch observation , multi - epoch data are available for @xmath12 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands .",
    "these were particularly suitable for the transient survey .",
    "this field was also observed in u - band by the kpno mayall 4 meter telescope @xcite , near - infrared by ukirt @xcite and ultraviolet by galex @xcite .",
    "these multi - wavelength data sets were crucial for constraining the sed of the transients and/or their host galaxies .",
    "the basic reduction of the suprime - cam data was performed using the sdfred @xcite . to discover the transients and variable objects , we made nightly stacked images for @xmath18 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "for these 3 bands , differential images were also generated with special - purpose software tuned to the subaru / suprim - cam data and based on an algorithm in @xcite .",
    "figure [ image ] shows the optical transient found in images taken on 5 march 2005 at ra@xmath19 and dec@xmath20 .",
    "the sdss serendipitously - detected this transient and lists it as a stellar - like object .",
    "we investigated available sdss images taken on 18 january 2005 with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 band filters .",
    "as in the sdf photometry , we measured the magnitudes in the @xmath23 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands on these images .",
    "there were marginal detections in the @xmath22 and @xmath23 bands .",
    "this sdss observation is the first time this object has been reported in this position .",
    "hereafter , we define 18 january 2005 as the starting point of the transient ( t@xmath24 ) .",
    "figure [ lc ] shows light curves for this transient with @xmath12 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "there is no significant variability between march 2001 and april 2003 .",
    "the amplitude of the event was about 3.4 mag and the transient faded out until june 2008 . although the light curves have no temporal coverage for the brightening period , the duration of the transient is approximately 800 d , which is significantly longer than that for typical ia , ib / c and iip sne .",
    "the host galaxy of the transient was identified using the deep - stacked @xmath10- and @xmath11-band images generated by @xcite .",
    "we also made deep - stack images for the @xmath18 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 bands using images taken before 5 march 2005 to exclude the transient component .",
    "as shown in figure [ image ] , the host galaxy of the transient is discernible in all 5 bands .",
    "we also confirmed that the source is significantly extended , compared to the size of the point spread function . by comparing the positions of nearby stars in our reference frame with the image in which transient was discovered , we are able to align the images with accuracy of @xmath25 rms . with an observed offset between the transient and the host galaxy of @xmath26 and @xmath27 ,",
    "the likelihood of a nuclear origin for the transient is only 0.03% .",
    "these deep images also allowed us to measure the brightness of the host galaxy accurately .",
    "based on the publicly released sdf catalog , we made a photometric calibration and performed aperture photometry for the host galaxy using a 2@xmath28 radius that was the same as that used for the sdf catalog .",
    "although the very deep u - band and nuv ( 175 - 275 nm ) images are available for this field , there is no counterpart at the position .",
    "the @xmath29 limits are @xmath30 in u - band and @xmath31 mag in nuv , respectively .",
    "we estimated a photometric redshift of the host galaxy using hyper - z @xcite code .",
    "the best - fitting result is @xmath32 with reduced @xmath33 of 1.02 using the burst template ( age of 0.13 gyr and the intrinsic extinction @xmath34 of 0.2 mag ) .",
    "the 3-sigma error range is 0.50 - 0.70 .",
    "figure [ photz ] shows the best - fitting model with actual measurements .",
    "the age of the host tends to be about 1.5@xmath352 times older than those of grb host galaxies @xcite .",
    "we also estimated the photometric redshift by using only the templates from coleman , wu & weedman ( 1980 , hereafter cww ) . in this case , the best - fitting galaxy is irregular , and the redshift estimation is @xmath36 with a reduced @xmath33 of 1.19 . in both cases ,",
    "the values are in agreement as @xmath3 . with this photometric redshift",
    ", the peak absolute magnitude of this transient is estimated to be @xmath37 mag , which is 2 - 3 magnitudes brighter than bright core - collapse sne . even at the lower limit of redshift ,",
    "the peak absolute magnitude is still @xmath38 mag . assuming no bolometric correction , the total integrated optical output from sdf-05m05 during the observations ( @xmath35850 days ) was @xmath39 erg , which is comparable with those of grbs @xcite .",
    "the absolute host magnitude was also calculated as @xmath40 mag , which is comparable to or rather fainter than that of smc .",
    "the transient was also imaged in the @xmath41 and @xmath42 bands by ukirt / wfcam on 15 april 2005 , and the corresponding catalog was generated by @xcite .",
    "at the transient position , we found a point source in both the j and k bands .",
    "although the contribution of the host galaxy is unclear in this photometry , the contamination is thought to be insignificant because the timing of the observation was close to the peak in the optical light curves ( figure [ lc ] ) and the shapes on the @xmath41 and @xmath42 images are point - like sources while the host in the optical data is significantly extended .",
    "furthermore , the expected magnitudes from the sed fitting of the host galaxy ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) are more than 2 mag fainter than the photometric result of ukirt .",
    "therefore , the blue of the source could be originating from the transient .",
    "we also generated the sed of the transient at 88 d after the first detection with sdf data .",
    "as shown in figure [ sed ] , the sed is significantly different from power law and well - fitted by a blackbody with a temperature of @xmath45 k.",
    "we presented detailed sdf data and photometric results of an optical transient search , which contain evidence of an unusual optical transient .",
    "its key features are as follows : a long duration light curve ; an intensive absolute magnitude ( remaining brighter than @xmath4619 mag over 300 d ) ; blue sed in nir data around the first detection ; offset from the center of host galaxy ; and a faint host galaxy .",
    "these key features suggest that the unusual transient may be unique supernova such as an ultra - luminous supernova , or a peculiar supernova with type iin spectral features .",
    "below , we discuss differences from agn and a tidal diruption flares and possibilities of these two supernova cases .",
    "agn origin is unlikely due to the offset from the center of host galaxy .",
    "in addition , the large amplitude of the transient also support this . because typical amplidude of agn variablity is less than 1 mag based on the long term sdss observations for the stripe 82 field ( e.g. ai et al .",
    "2010 , butler & bloom 2011 , macleod et al 2012 ) .",
    "the tidal disruption of stars by massive black holes at the centers of galaxies show the large amplitude flare at optical , uv , and x - ray wavelengths although some event showed no uv / transient emission due to a large amount of dust obscuration @xcite .",
    "but the tidal disruption flare is also unlikely due to the offset . besides the location in the host ,",
    "the sed and temporal evolutions are also different from expectation of the tidal diruption flare at x - ray or uv wavelengths ( the temperature of the inner accretion disc is @xmath47 k ) .",
    "because the observed temperature in present case is significantly lower than that predicted for a tidal disruption , this transient is unlikely to be a typical one of that type .",
    "@xcite predicted that an early stage super - eddington outflow would produce an intensive optical emission with a blackbody spectrum initially peaking at optical / uv wavelengths .",
    "the expected color evolution becomes bluer if the observation is made close to the peak wavelength , or showing no colour change if the observation is on the rayleigh ",
    "jeans tail .",
    "the blackbody spectrum peak at around 6500k is consistent with this prediction @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ lc ] , the current event shows both bluer and redder colors changing at 750 d after the first detection .",
    "this is inconsistent with the prediction .",
    "the key features of ultra - luminous sne are a roughly symmetric light curve , an absolute peak magnitudes of @xmath4821 to @xmath8 mag , and a faint host galaxy ( a low mass and presumably a low - metallicity environment where are desirable for their massive progenitors ( e.g. stoll et al .",
    "2011 ; neill et al .",
    "recent systematic studies by the palomar transient factory , pan - starrs and others have identified a number of such events ( e.g. , ofek et al .",
    "2007 , pastorello et al .",
    "2010 , quimby et al . 2011 ; chomiuk et al .",
    "2011 ) . to compare the present case with ultra - luminous sne",
    ", we plotted the light curves of sn2010gx @xcite , scp06f6 @xcite , sn2006gy @xcite , and sn2008es @xcite together with that of the current event . here , we note that former two events have no obvious evidence of circumstellar interaction , sn2006gy show it , and sn2008es has implications .",
    "figure [ comp ] shows clear differences in absolute magnitude ( @xmath49 mag fainter ) and duration ( @xmath49 times longer ) .",
    "the current event is therefore unlikely to be of ultra - luminous sne origin .",
    "the third possibility is that the observed transient is an sne with type iin spectral features .",
    "such events are still rarely observed , but the number of detections is increasing .",
    "figure [ comp ] shows the light curves of sn1997cy @xcite , sn2003ma @xcite , sn2005kd @xcite , and sn2008iy @xcite .",
    "all 4 events show extremely long ( @xmath50 d ) durations . for sn2008iy ,",
    "additional data points were collected from the 3@xmath51-survey of pan - starrs1 @xcite .",
    "this was because the time coverage of the data available from literature was insufficiently long to allow a comparison with the current event .",
    "the survey successfully detected the late phase ( 490@xmath351000 d after the peak ) of sn2008iy in @xmath52 and @xmath53 band @xcite .",
    "besides sn2003ma , the temporal evolution of the current event resembles those of sn1997cy , sn2005kd and sn2008iy in the temporal breaks at around @xmath54 d in the rest frame .",
    "the linear decline rates of sn1997cy and sn2005kd before and after the break of these events are commonly @xmath55 mag/100 d and @xmath56 mag/100 d , respectively .",
    "the latter is faster than the expected rate of decline for radioactive @xmath57 ( 0.98 mag/100 d ) .",
    "although the temporal duration of the current event is comparable to those of peculiar sne , there are significant differences in the decline rates .",
    "the linear decay rates of sdf-05m05 in the @xmath1-band before and after the temporal break are 0.28 mag/100 d and 0.76/100 d , respectively .",
    "these decline rates are all slower than the expected rate of the decline for radioactive @xmath57 .",
    "sn2008iy has a decline rate similar to that of sdf-05m05 .",
    "however , the broad - band sed of the current transient is well fitted by the single - temperature blackbody model , whereas that of sn2008iy deviates from the blackbody and is more like that of usual type iin event @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ sed ] , this broad - band sed property is also another significant differences between sn type iin and sdf-05m05 .",
    "in addition , the temperature was lower than that of type iin sn2003ma and sn2008am , which had blackbody spectrum @xcite .",
    "although we can not entirely rule out the possibility of this event being of peculiar sne - iin origin because of unclear common properties of peculiar - iin events , the current energetic event may be a new type of optical transient altogether .",
    "all of these luminous optical transients are found in faint host galaxies .",
    "although this may be due to selection bias , the characteristics of the host galaxies are crucial to an understanding of the origins and occurrence rates of the transients .",
    "considering to the luminosity function of various types of galaxies ( e.g zucca et al .",
    "2006 ) , the fraction of faint galaxies , such as the host galaxy of sdf-05m05 , is expected to increase with redshift .",
    "@xcite used the same 4 cww galaxy templates used for the photometric redshift in the present study .",
    "this may make detections of luminous events rare in nearby universe but common at higher redshift ( e.g. , @xmath58 ) .",
    "the apparent magnitudes at higher redshift will be fainter than 22 - 23 mag as same as in the current event .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of the medium deep survey of pan - starrs is comparable with the maximum brightness of the current event .",
    "hence , it is expected that pan - starrs has been detecting numbers of these long and luminous optical transients associated with faint host galaxies .",
    "however , a slow evolution and the presence of a faint host galaxy make it difficult to classify these events as real optical transients .",
    "therefore , coordinated long - term monitoring with larger - aperture telescopes is needed to better determine their origins . in such work , the planned strategic survey with a time - domain - survey cadence using the new wide - field imager , hyper - suprime - cam attached to subaru will prove invaluable .",
    "this work is supported by grants nsc 100 - 2112-m-008 - 007-my3 ( yu ) , 99 - 2112-m-002 - 002-my3 ( kyh ) and the grant - in - aid for scientific research ( 19540238 ) from the jsps of japan .",
