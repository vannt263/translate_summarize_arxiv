    "the rapid growth of observational measurements on expansion history reveals the expanding paradigm of the universe .",
    "this fact is based on accumulative observational evidences mainly from type ia supernova and other renowned sources @xcite .",
    "the expanding phase implicates the presence of a repulsive force which compensates the attractiveness property of gravity on cosmological scales .",
    "this phenomenon may be translated as the existence of exotic matter components and most acceptable understanding for such enigma is termed as dark energy ( de ) having large negative pressure .",
    "various de models and modified theories of gravity have been proposed to incorporate the role of de in cosmic expansion history ( for review see @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to einstein s relativity and its proposed modifications where the source of gravity is determined by curvature scalar terms , another formulation is presented which comprises torsional formulation as gravity source @xcite .",
    "this theory is labeled as tegr ( teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ) and it is determined by a lagrangian density involving a zero curvature weitzenb@xmath2ck connection instead of a zero torsion levi - civita connection with the vierbein as a fundamental tool .",
    "the weitzenb@xmath2ck connection is an specific connection which characterizes a globally flat space - time endowed with a non - zero torsion tensor . using that connection",
    ", one can construct an alternative and equivalent theory of gr .",
    "the later comes out since the scalar torsion only differs by a boundary term @xmath3 with the scalar curvature by the relationship @xmath4 , making both variations of the einstein - hilbert and tegr actions the same .",
    "thus , these two theories have the same field equations . however , these two theories have different geometrical interpretations since in tegr the torsion acts a force meanwhile in gr , the gravitational effects are understood due to the curved space - time .",
    "tegr is then further extended to a generalized form by the inclusion of a @xmath5 function in the lagrangian density ( as @xmath6 is the extension of gr ) and it has been tested cosmologically by numerous researchers @xcite .",
    "it is important to mention that @xmath5 and @xmath6 are no longer equivalent theories , and in order to consider the equivalent teleparallel theory of @xmath6 , one needs to consider a more generalized function @xmath7 , incorporating the boundary term in the action @xcite .",

    "they also discussed the validity of generalized second law of thermodynamic in cosmological constant regime @xcite .",
    "another very studied approach in modified theories of gravity is to change the matter content of the universe by adding a scalar field in the matter sector .",
    "these models have been considered several times in cosmology , having different kind of scalar fields such as quintessence , quintom , k - essence , etc ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , we can also extend that idea by adding a coupling between the scalar field and the gravitational sector ( see @xcite ) where cosmologically speaking , we can have new interesting results such as the possibility of crossing the phantom barrier .",
