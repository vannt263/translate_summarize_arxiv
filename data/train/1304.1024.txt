    "linear atomic chains of metal atoms on semiconductor surfaces offer , in principle , the physical realization of phenomena predicted theoretically for one - dimensional model systems . in practice , however , unanticipated interactions can often complicate the picture and lead to behavior not easily explained by simple models . in this article we demonstrate theoretically how the complex interactions among polarized electron spins in silicon surface states determine the observed behavior of a well - studied atomic chain system , si(553)-au , over a wide range of temperatures . the methods developed here and the resulting predictions  which are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with experimental observations",
    " are also likely to apply more broadly to other vicinal si / au chain systems , such as si(557)-au .",
    "the si(553)-au surface was first investigated in ref .  ,",
    "an experimental study which established that the electronic band dispersion and fermi surface were indeed those of a nearly one - dimensional metal . since then , numerous lines of research have emerged .",
    "efforts to determine the basic atomic structure of the surface have been based on data from diffraction experiments@xcite and on the results of theoretical total - energy calculations.@xcite these were greatly aided by the first definitive determination of the coverage of au atoms on si(553)-au.@xcite other investigations have explored the properties of finite - length chains@xcite as well as various native defects@xcite and foreign adsorbates @xcite on the nominally clean si(553)-au surface .",
    "one particularly interesting line of research has focused on the collective behavior in si(553)-au that emerges at low temperature .",
    "ideal one - dimensional metals with partially filled bands exhibit a broken symmetry at low temperature , namely a charge - density wave arising from the peierls instability .",
    "indeed , broken symmetries in si(553)-au were observed using scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) in refs .   and .",
    "images acquired at room temperature showed alternating bright and dim rows with unit periodicity @xmath3 along the rows . below @xmath050",
    "k these rows separately developed higher - order periodicity : a tripled period ( 3@xmath3 ) along the bright rows and a doubled period ( 2@xmath3 ) along the dim rows .",
    "subsequent review articles have discussed possible explanations for these observations.@xcite    notwithstanding the fact that peierls instabilities lead to higher - order periodicity , a completely different theoretical explanation for the coexisting triple and double periodicities in si(553)-au was proposed in ref .  .",
    "the key idea , which was based on the results of density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations , was that the ground state of si(553)-au is spin polarized . in the dft ground state , the silicon atoms that comprise the steps on this vicinal surface have dangling bonds , every third of which is occupied by a single fully polarized electron while the other two are doubly occupied .",
    "the bright rows seen in empty - state stm images arise from these step - edge silicon atoms . at low temperature",
    "the @xmath4 peaks that appear in this row are from the spin - polarized atoms , which have precisely this periodicity .",
    "the dft ground state also reveals a period doubling within the row of au atoms . both of these higher - order periodicities disappear if spin polarization is suppressed in the calculation , providing compelling evidence that spin polarization is the primary mechanism underlying the observed symmetry breaking in si(553)-au .",
    "experiments were subsequently carried out to look for a spectroscopic signature of this predicted spin - polarized ground state .",
    "the dft calculations showed that an unoccupied state should exist 0.5 ev above the fermi level and be localized at the polarized silicon atoms.@xcite the existence and spectral and spatial location of this state was indeed confirmed by two - photon photoemission @xcite and by scanning tunneling spectroscopy.@xcite    the predictions of ref .   only addressed the zero - temperature ground state of si(553)-au .",
    "left unanswered in that work was the question of how the broken - symmetry ground state evolves to have normal @xmath3 periodicity above @xmath050 k. this article addresses that question from a theoretical and computational perspective .",
    "although it may seem obvious that thermal fluctuations are important , the nature of these fluctuations turns out to be unexpectedly subtle .",
    "nevertheless , we derive here a number of detailed qualitative as well as quantitative predictions that can easily be tested experimentally .",
    "the results of these tests will furnish additional evidence for evaluating the validity of the basic mechanism proposed in ref .  .",
    "the physical and magnetic structure of si(553)-au in its ground state were first proposed and discussed in ref .   and for reference",
    "are reproduced in fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "this is a stepped surface consisting of ( 111 ) terraces and bilayer steps , and is stabilized by au atoms that substitute for si atoms in the surface layer of the terrace .",

    ", arrows ) from the complete polarization of the electron occupying the dangling - bond orbital .",
    "the sign of the polarization ( red vs.  blue ) alternates along the step .",
    "the six atoms in the outlined box are the focus of the ab - initio molecular dynamics discussed in sec .",
    "[ model],width=302 ]    the surface electronic structure of si(553)-au has two main contributions .",
    "the first consists of two intense quasi-1d parabolic electron bands centered at the boundary of the surface brillouin zone .",
    "these `` au bands '' arise from the bonding and antibonding combinations of au 6@xmath5 and subsurface si orbitals ( purple atoms ) .",
    "the bonding au band is approximately half - filled and the antibonding band approximately one - fourth filled .",
    "the second contribution arises from the very edge of the si honeycomb chain , which consists of threefold - coordinated si atoms .",
    "the unpassivated @xmath6 orbitals of these atoms can in principle be occupied by zero , one , or two electrons .",
    "the si atoms themselves supply , on average , one electron per orbital",
    ". the step edge does not necessarily maintain this average occupancy , because electronic charge can also be transferred to or from the au bands .",
    "indeed , dft calculations predict that the lowest energy configuration has one electron in every third orbital ( red and blue atoms in fig.[model ] ) and double occupancy everywhere else ( green atoms ) .",
    "the singly occupied orbitals are completely spin - polarized and hence have local spin moments of 1 bohr magneton each . physically , these atoms relax slightly downward , by 0.3  , compared to their nonpolarized neighbors . the sign of the spins alternates along the step edge , with antiferromagnetic order favored by 15 mev per spin relative to ferromagnetic order .",
    "therefore the magnetic periodicity is 6@xmath3 , where @xmath3 is the si surface lattice constant .",
    "this is also the smallest period that allows for the coexistence of 3@xmath3 spacing of the spins and 2@xmath3 spacing ( period doubling ) within the au chain .",
    "this coexistence was first observed in stm experiments@xcite and emerges naturally in dft calculations ",
    "but only when the spin degree of freedom is unconstrained.@xcite",
    "the remainder of this article explores excitations of si(553)-au from its ground state due to finite temperature .",
    "two main theoretical tools were used : ab - initio molecular dynamics ( md ) and kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations .",
    "the first was used to identify the most important low - energy activated processes and to determine their activation barriers . because of the complexity of the system only small time scales",
    "( tens of ps ) and a small ( 1@xmath76 ) simulation cell could be addressed using ab - initio md . to reach much longer time scales ( tens of ns ) and larger system sizes ( up to 128 spins ) we constructed a one - dimensional kmc model based on the processes and barriers determined from ab - initio md .",
    "in particular , the kmc model allowed us to investigate finite - temperature behavior in the presence of pinning defects  providing useful insight into temperature - dependent results from scanning probe experiments , where defects often play a critical role .",
    "two simplifying assumptions were used throughout this work .",
    "( 1 ) electronic excitations were not considered , and consequently the system stays on the born - oppenheimer surface .",
    "this assumption is reasonable in view of the modest temperatures  room temperature and lower  considered here .",
    "( 2 ) spin flips were not allowed .",
    "although , as we will see below , the spins can diffuse among the si step - edge atoms , their signs and ordering remained that of the original antiferromagnetic ordering .",
    "although a different initial spin ordering might affect some details of the simulation , the overall qualitative findings would be very similar .",
    "the md simulations were performed using the same basic geometry and computational parameters described in ref .  .",
    "the si(553)-au surface was represented by six layers of si plus the reconstructed top surface layer and a vacuum region of 10  .",
    "all atoms were free to move during the simulation except the bottom si layer and its passivating hydrogen layer .",
    "total energies and forces were calculated within the generalized - gradient approximation of perdew , burke , and ernzerhof to dft using projector - augmented wave potentials , as implemented in vasp.@xcite the plane - wave cutoff was 200 ev and only the @xmath8 point was used .",
    "the dynamics simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble using a nos thermostat and a time step of 3 fs .",
    "five temperatures , equally spaced in @xmath9 , were used ( 57 , 67 , 80 , 110 , 133 k ) .",
    "for each temperature a thermalization run of 10 ps was first performed , followed by a dynamics run of 20 ps .",
    "figure [ stepheightmom ] shows the resulting atomic trajectories during the entire run of 10@xmath10 md time steps for the lowest temperature studied , 57 k. the six curves are for the six si step - edge atoms in the outlined box of fig .",

    "the upper and lower panels show the relative heights of the atoms and their local spin moments , respectively .",

    "the spin - up red atom went rapidly to zero while , concurrently , a spin - up moment rapidly developed on the neighboring cyan atom . at essentially the same time",
    "the height of the red atom increased by 0.3   to that of a non - polarized atom , while the cyan atom moved down by the same amount . in summary ,",
    "the spin - up moment that was localized on the red atom hopped to one of its neighbors .",
    "very soon after , a second hop occurred at 15.71 ps .",
    "this hop was made by the other spin ( with the opposite sign ) which moved from the blue atom to the magenta atom .",
    "it is not a coincidence that this hop occurred so soon after the first .",
    "the first hop changed the minimum spacing between spins from 3@xmath3 to 2@xmath3 , incurring an energy penalty ( discussed in detail below ) .",
    "this increase in energy in turn reduced the barrier for any hop that restores the spacing to its optimal value .",
    "the cyan and magenta atoms are indeed separated by 3@xmath3 , and thus after two rapid spin hops the system was restored to an equivalent ground state configuration , in which it remained for the rest of the simulation .",
    "the very small number of hops observed at 57 k makes it clear that ab - initio md simulations of si(553)-au at still lower temperatures , where many of the relevant experiments are conducted , are not feasible .",
    "instead we turn to higher temperatures and ask how the frequency of hopping events depends on temperature .",
    "this information will be useful in sec .",
    "[ kmc ] for calibrating and validating our kmc model in a temperature range accessible to both methods .",
    "figure [ rates ] shows the resulting time - averaged hopping rate for a single spin , versus inverse temperature .",
    "the rates for low temperatures have large statistical uncertainties ( not shown ) and hence it is reasonable to describe these results by a simple linear arrhenius fit , as shown . the attempt frequency , @xmath11 s@xmath12 , is on the order of a surface vibrational frequency , as expected .",

    "we used dft results obtained from the full si(553)-au system for this task . in the spirit of simplicity",
    "we constructed the kmc model itself to be strictly one - dimensional , with an arbitrarily large unit cell and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus the kmc simulations inherit much of the accuracy of the dft calculations but make the additional approximation that spin hops along different step edges are independent .",
    "figure [ barriers ] shows the dft potential energy surface for the spin hop observed in fig .",

    "[ md ] , that the red - to - cyan ( forward ) spin hop incurs an energy penalty that leads to a smaller barrier for the cyan - to - red ( reverse ) hop .",
    "specifically , the activation barrier for the forward hop is 30 mev , the resulting energy penalty is 25 mev , and the barrier for the reverse hop is 5 mev .",
    "these two types of hops , and their calculated barriers , are two of the three fundamental processes included in our kmc model .    for convenience",
    "we define here a more compact notation for enumerating the different types of spin hops .",
    "careful examination of the ab - initio md trajectories reveals that all spin hops were to an adjacent site ; there were no double hops .",
    "hence we can label every hop as either leftward ( @xmath18 ) or rightward ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "we assume that the barrier for a spin hop depends only on the spin s immediate environment , that is , on the distances @xmath20 and @xmath21 to the left and right neighboring spins , respectively , measured before making the hop . using this notation",
    "we can express the barriers for the two hops shown in fig .",
    "[ barriers ] as @xmath22 mev and @xmath23 mev , where the two numerical arguments denote @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",

    "[ barriers ] . from dft nudged elastic - band calculations we find @xmath27 = @xmath28 mev ( the barriers are equal by symmetry ) .",
    "as expected from the distances to the neighboring spins , this barrier is in between the previous two .",
    "the md trajectories also show that two spins never occupy adjacent sites . because of this",
    ", our enumeration of the possible spin hops is already complete for all cases with @xmath29 .",
    "( it is worth noting that the configuration in which a spin has both neighbors at @xmath30 is allowed , but because its adjacent sites can not be occupied this spin can not hop until one of its neighbors does . )",
    "the cases with @xmath31 are difficult to treat within dft but occur more rarely and thus are less important .",
    "for this reason we treated the effect of neighbors beyond @xmath4 as negligible , used the barrier of 30 mev for any hop that brings a spin within @xmath30 of its neighbor , and assigned a single ( arbitrary ) barrier of 10 mev to hops that maintain larger separations than this .",
    "this completes our enumeration .",
    "to finish the construction of the kmc model , we assumed that the rates for all allowed spin hops are given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is a common prefactor and @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the dft barriers .    to determine the optimal value of @xmath33 and compare the predictions of the kmc model to the ab - initio md results",

    "the kmc rates have negligible statistical errors and it is clear that a simple arrhenius fit describes them very well . moreover , the fitted attempt frequency , @xmath13 s@xmath12 , and activation energy , 12 mev , are within 10% of the md values .",
    "this confirms that the kmc model accurately reproduces the ab - initio results within the temperature range considered .      in real systems , the behavior of collective phenomena",
    "is often controlled by defects that pin the phase of a low - temperature state having broken symmetry . on the si(553)-au surface , a variety of defects ",

    "we prepared a system consisting of 128 independent spins , with periodic boundary conditions , initially arranged in the antiferromagnetic ground state with uniform 3@xmath3 spacing .",
    "one of the spins ( at position 0 ) was pinned in place throughout the simulation , thus representing a generic immobile defect .",

    "figure [ trajdefect ] displays the resulting trajectories at 300 k of all the spins over the first 10 ns of the simulation . for clarity",

    "a histogram was made representing the position of that spin at 300 k. at this temperature a simulation time of 1 @xmath40s was sufficient to obtain the steady - state distribution .",
    "it is readily apparent from examining the colored histograms that each is well described by a gaussian function centered on the spin s initial position .",
    "thus each of these gaussians is entirely specified by its variance @xmath41 , whose value depends on the distance @xmath39 to the pinning defect . to deduce this dependence",
    "we first note that the area under each gaussian is by construction the same .",
    "hence the height of each gaussian is proportional to @xmath42 .",
    "we find empirically that the dependence of these heights on distance is given with excellent accuracy as @xmath38 .",
    "an envelope function with this dependence is shown on the histogram plot as a heavy black curve . from this dependence",
    "we thus deduce that the thermally induced widths @xmath43 , defined here as @xmath44 , increase with distance from a pinning defect as @xmath45 .",

    "the light gray shaded area is bounded by logarithmic fits to the lower ( red ) and upper ( orange ) data points .",
    "the characteristic temperatures @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 describe different criteria by which thermal wandering of spins is expected to be either eliminated or suppressed ; see discussion in text .",
    "[ widthsdefect],width=302 ]    figure [ widthsdefect ] summarizes the resulting temperature dependence .",
    "the six datasets show @xmath50 for every tenth spin of the 128-spin simulation cell . for reference",
    ", the six values at @xmath51 k correspond to the six gaussian widths in the upper half of the histogram panel in fig .",
    "[ trajdefect ] .",
    "we find empirically that the dependence of each dataset on temperature is close to logarithmic , as shown by the light gray shaded area .",
    "this implies that the dependence of the thermal widths on distance and temperature can be separated and written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 and the characteristic temperature @xmath47 has the fitted value 21 k. all thermal wandering is , by definition , completely eliminated at @xmath47 .",
    "but two less restrictive criteria may be more relevant for interpreting the experimentally observed transition to the period - tripled ground state . at @xmath54",
    "k the thermal widths for all 128 spins become smaller than the width of a single lattice site . hence , below this temperature the spins will in effect be frozen into place on every third lattice site . at still higher temperature ,",
    "@xmath55 k , all thermal widths are less than or equal to the average spacing ( three lattice sites ) between spins . hence the spins will first become distinguishable as the system is cooled below this temperature .    to generalize this result and make predictions that can be tested by experiment , we first assume that real systems can be characterized by a known average concentration @xmath56 of pinning defects . because the defects are distributed in 1d , the characteristic distance @xmath39 from a spin to the nearest defect scales as @xmath57 . by inverting eq.[eq :",
    "w ] we then immediately obtain a simple result : the temperatures @xmath58 at which all spins in the system become either frozen into place or distinguishable will scale as @xmath59 .",
    "thus we predict this scaling to describe the temperature at which the period - tripled ground state of si(553)-au is first observed .    by inserting into this qualitative relationship the appropriate constants obtained from the kmc simulations ,",
    "we derive a quantitative prediction for the freezing temperature , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a dimensionless constant and @xmath56 is expressed in the dimensionless units of defects per lattice site . the corresponding equation for @xmath49",

    "this transition occurs with a characteristic temperature comparable to that obtained , @xmath76 k , by extrapolating from the behavior in the presence of defects .",
    "thus these two complementary approaches lead to qualitatively as well as quantitatively similar conclusions .",
    "a guiding principle in one - dimensional physics is provided by the mermin - wagner theorem , which states that phase transitions can not occur above @xmath1 if the interactions are short - ranged.@xcite exploring the different manifestations of this theorem in real systems can yield new and unanticipated insights .",
    "for example , a previous publication by one of us demonstrated theoretically that when the interactions are @xmath77 short - ranged , as for @xmath78 coulomb interactions , then a well - defined thermodynamic phase transition can indeed occur  and likely does occur for a system of ba adsorbates on si(111).@xcite in the present article the new insights into 1d physics are of a different kind : we have shown that even when the interactions are short - ranged , and the system purely 1d , a well - ordered phase with the clear signature of a broken symmetry can form well above @xmath1 . moreover",
    ", an approximate transition temperature can be readily identified using realistic simulations and straightforward statistical analysis .",
    "for si(553)-au the precise nature of the interacting entities is unexpected and somewhat subtle : our md simulations showed that they are neither simple vibrations of atoms , nor spins on a simple fixed lattice , but rather a tightly coupled combination of both . in this sense",
    "a description of si(553)-au based on spin polarons is appropriate .",
    "our kmc simulations showed that as the temperature of the system is raised , the ground state @xmath4 crystal formed by these polarons melts at a temperature we estimate to be @xmath030 k for perfectly clean systems , and higher for systems with pinning defects .",
    "a direct experimental test of this description is afforded by eq.[eq : t ] , which predicts how the transition temperature varies with the concentration of defects .",
    "it is important to acknowledge some limitations of this work .",
    "because our focus has been on the behavior of si(553)-au at low temperature , we have assumed that the spin - polarized silicon states remain polarized at higher temperatures .",
    "our preliminary calculations indicate that this assumption is completely justified at the temperatures of interest here .",
    "however , at much higher temperatures the thermally induced vibrations of the step edge atoms increasingly render the system nonpolarized for part of the time .",
    "for example , at room temperature the average spin moment is reduced to roughly 2/3 of its low - temperature value of 1 bohr magneton .",
    "future theoretical investigations into the behavior of si(553)-au near room temperature will have to account for this thermal suppression of the spin polarization .",
    "finally , as mentioned in sec .  [ finitetemp ] , we have throughout assumed for simplicity that the ordering of the spins remains antiferromagnetic , as in the ground state .",
    "preliminary calculations show that the barriers for spin hopping depend quantitatively , although not qualitatively , on the signs of the neighboring spins . a generalization of our kmc model that includes spin flips would be a very interesting direction to pursue , but we anticipate that the qualitative conclusions drawn here  as well as the overall consistency between our findings and those of existing experiments  would be largely unchanged .    many discussions with f.j .",

    "<S> when gold is deposited on si(553 ) , the surface self - assembles to form a periodic array of steps with nearly perfect structural order . in scanning tunneling microscopy these steps </S>",
    "<S> resemble quasi - one - dimensional atomic chains . at temperatures below @xmath050 </S>",
    "<S> k the chains develop a tripled periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> we recently predicted , on the basis of density - functional theory calculations at @xmath1 , that this tripled periodicity arises from the complete polarization of the electron spin on every third silicon atom along the step ; in the ground state these linear chains of silicon spins are antiferromagnetically ordered . </S>",
    "<S> here we explore , using ab - initio molecular dynamics and kinetic monte carlo simulations , the behavior of silicon spin chains on si(553)-au at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> thermodynamic phase transitions at @xmath2 in one - dimensional systems are prohibited by the mermin - wagner theorem . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless we find that a surprisingly sharp onset occurs upon cooling  at about 30 k for perfect surfaces and at higher temperature for surfaces with defects  to a well - ordered phase with tripled periodicity , in good agreement with experiment . </S>"
