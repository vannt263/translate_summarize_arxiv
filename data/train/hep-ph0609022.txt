    "although the maximum oscillation probability in fig . [ fig : plot ] is the same as for vacuum oscillations , _",

    "[ fig : multiunit ] with realistic material slab densities . in comparison ,",
    "neutrino propagation through a single material slab of density @xmath129 g/@xmath116 has virtually no effect on the oscillation length due to the smallness of @xmath112 . in order to probe for this parametric resonance effect",
    ", one would consequently need an experimental setup with consecutive material slabs of density @xmath130 g/@xmath116 and an effective neutrino trajectory of less than 1 km .",
    "we stress the fact that the idea of substantially increasing the oscillation length by means of the parametric resonance effect is experimentally realistic and constitutes an interesting meta - effect that could yield information concerning the validity of a 2 or 1 + 1 flavor approximation in a neutrino factory .",
    "thus , the results presented in this paper could prove useful in light of future short - baseline accelerator neutrino detection experiments .    finally , we comment upon potential obstacles and competing effects that are vital to take into account when considering this type of parametric resonance effect . for instance , in a disappearance experiment where a deficit of @xmath131 signatures is measured , it is important to estimate the magnitude of @xmath132 conversions where @xmath133 in order to be certain of that one is truly observing the present parametric resonance effect .",
    "consider for instance production of @xmath134 at a neutrino source in a disappearance experiment where @xmath135 oscillations would be a competing effect with the parametric resonance presently discussed .",
    "making use of eq .",
    "( [ eq:3prob ] ) to estimate the conversion of active - active type as opposed to active - sterile , it is found that for the established large mixing angle ( lma ) parameters aforementioned for distances @xmath136 km , @xmath137 = @xmath138 when the neutrino energy is @xmath120 mev .",
    "this amounts to roughly one third of the maximun oscillation probability in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] , which obviously is a non - negligible contribution to the total conversion rate of @xmath134 .",
    "discrimination of active - active conversions from active - sterile conversions could be obtained from _",
    "e.g. _ the process @xmath139 in a scintillator detector .",
    "we stress that the active - active flavor oscillations are not subject to the parametric resonance conditions given our present values of @xmath140 and @xmath109 ( see previous section ) and simply mimic the ordinary vacuum oscillation probability in spite of the presence of slabs .",
    "the active - sterile flavor oscillations , however , are subject to the interesting manipulation illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] .",
    "moreover , it is clear that the observation of this effect demands that the specific oscillation probability profile of fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] is identified with enough accuracy to unquestionably distinguish it from pure vacuum oscillations .",
    "this would preferably require several detectors placed along the trajectory of the antineutrinos instead of one ; _",
    "e.g. _ an intermediate detector at for instance @xmath141 km . clearly , the solid line shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] offers the most promising scenario for the study of the oscillation probability profile since fewer oscillations will have taken place than in the case of the dashed and dotted lines at any distance .",
    "another issue that also deserves comment concerns the collimation of the neutrino beam .",
    "a large angular spreading of the neutrino trajectories could endanger the validity of the parametric resonance conditions for a setup as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multiunit ] .",
    "short - baseline experiments of type lsnd with a distance source - detector of less than , say , 100 m , will benefit from a better collimation than distances approaching 1 km .",
    "the collimation in the latter case would also be worse than neutrinos with energies of order @xmath142(gev ) in long - baseline experiments .",
    "as an estimate for the loss of neutrino flux poor collimation can give rise to , thus lowering the number of neutrino trajectories originating from the source that are subject to the parametric resonance conditions , consider the following scenario .",
    "assume that the slabs in fig .",
    "[ fig : multiunit ] are of height 2 m and that the entire neutrino flux is incident on the first slab located at @xmath143 but spreads out in a cone from the source . at a distance of @xmath144 km , the neutrino flux through the last slab ( _ e.g. _ a detector ) would then have been reduced to a fraction @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the radius of the cross - section of the cone at that distance . with the given conditions ,",
    "one easily finds that @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the angle at which the neutrino beam is spread compared to horisontal ground .",
    "thus , @xmath149 and it is seen that a considerable fraction of the neutrino flux is removed from the trajectories passing through the slabs . consequently , this would constitute a possible limiting factor of the applicability of the parametric resonance effect depending on the size of the neutrino flux of the source , or at least place high demands upon the collimation of the neutrino beam .",
    "in summary , we have derived an exact analytical expression for parametric resonance for antineutrino flavor conversions in a 3 + 1 flavor scenario for lsnd best - fit results . in order to exploit the idea of multiple non - adiabatic density shifts to obtain an oscillation probability that _ exceeds _ the maximum oscillation probability in vacuum ( matter )",
    ", it follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq : resprob ] ) that @xmath150 must be satisfied .",
    "consequently , the observability and application of a parametrically enhanced oscillation probability depends on obtaining a large @xmath112 , which is impossible to achieve for realistic densities .",
    "however , the parametric resonance effect offers an interesting possibility to increase the _ effective _ neutrino oscillation length , thus leading to the maximum vacuum oscillation probability being sustained over a much larger interval than in the scenario of pure vacuum oscillations or even oscillations in a single medium .",
    "we showed that this effect would be observable in a realistic experimental setup using material slabs of density @xmath151 g/@xmath116 and a total neutrino trajectory of less than 1 km , giving rise to a specific oscillation probability profile where the effective oscillation length is manifested as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] .",
    "we stress that the maximum oscillation probability is _ not _ enhanced over this distance , but rather the effective oscillation length . with regard to detection",
    ", a disappearance experiment could search for @xmath152 oscillations in both the cc and nc channel , while @xmath153 and @xmath154 oscillations would be harder to detect since interactions with @xmath155 , @xmath156 only occur in the nc channel .",
    "furthermore , there are experimental complications associated with probing of the parametric resonance effect in terms of competing active - active flavor oscillations and the collimation of the neutrino beam over a longer distance source - detector ( 1 km ) than most short - baseline accelerator experiments .",
    "these arguments must be taken into account upon considering realistic approaches in terms of exploiting the parametric resonance effect for active - sterile antineutrino conversions .",
    "it is clear that this parametric resonance of the oscillation probability would be applicable to any 2 or 1 + 1 flavor scenario . in light of the expected miniboone results ,",
    "the validity of such an approximation could yield an interesting opportunity to take advantage of this effect .",
