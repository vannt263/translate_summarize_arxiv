    "the phase structure of ising models with extended range interactions in two and three dimensions is very rich in general @xcite . in 3d",
    "when the spin interfaces are regarded as describing a gas of closed surfaces one gets a similarly rich diagram for morphological transitions in an equivalent plaquette surface model @xcite .",
    "the relation between the weighting of area , right - angled bends and intersections in a plaquette surface model and the couplings of an ising model with nearest neighbour , next to nearest neighbour and plaquette interactions on the dual lattice is explicitly known @xcite .",
    "this equivalence between an ising model and a surface gas is particularly convenient for performing monte carlo simulations , where the ising model transcription offers obvious practical advantages .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in a class of ising model hamiltonians which assign zero weight to the area of an interface .",
    "any surface tension that appears in the model is thus generated by fluctuations .",
    "higher spin models with zero bare surface tension @xcite have been investigated in some detail , particularly in the context of wetting transitions @xcite , but the gonihedric ising model realization is still relatively unexplored .",
    "the genesis of the gonihedric ising models lies in a random surface model developed by savvidy et al .",
    "@xcite where the action for a triangulated 2d surface embedded in @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 the sum being over the edges of some triangulated surface , @xmath9 , @xmath10 is some exponent ( smaller than one , or else the model is ill - defined @xcite ) , and @xmath11 is the dihedral angle between adjacent triangles .",
    "this action was proposed to cure some of the diseases of other triangulated random surface theories , which have proved remarkably reluctant to yield smooth continuum limits .",
    "taking the discretization a stage further and discretizing the target space , which thus becomes @xmath12 , the authors of @xcite rewrote the resulting theory as precisely the sort of extended ising model considered in @xcite .",
    "specializing to three dimensions , the energy of a plaquette surface in the gonihedric model is given by by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the number of links where two plaquettes meet at a right angle and @xmath15 is the number of links where four plaquettes meet at right angles .",
    "@xmath0 is a free parameter which determines the relative weight of the intersections compared with the right - angled bends .",
    "the results of @xcite show that an ising hamiltonian which gives @xmath13 contains nearest neighbour ( @xmath16 ) , next to nearest neighbour ( @xmath17 ) and round a plaquette ( @xmath18 $ ] ) terms @xmath19}^ { } \\sigma_{i } \\sigma_{j}\\sigma_{k } \\sigma_{l}. \\label{e1}\\ ] ] of course it should be pointed out that the equivalence between eqs .",
    "( [ e4a ] ) and ( [ e1 ] ) is only at a very intuitive level .",
    "ising surfaces have a degree of self - avoidance , which the gonihedric action has not .",
    "the resolution of the resulting spin configurations in terms of plaquette surfaces is ambiguous too ( do the surfaces touch or cut each other ? ) , but for large enough ( additional ) self - avoidance coupling @xmath0 the distinction may be irrelevant .",
    "the ratio of coefficients that appear in eq.([e1 ] ) is rather particular , it corresponds to the so - called disorder variety as calculated in the mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "the above hamiltonian displays a `` flip '' symmetry  a plane of spins may be flipped at zero energy cost if it does not intersect any other planes .",
    "this symmetry poses some problems in monte carlo simulations when one is attempting to measure e.g. magnetic exponents as lamellar low temperature configurations with arbitrary interlayer spacing render the standard magnetization @xmath20 meaningless .",
    "the solution adopted in @xcite was to fix three perpendicular planes of spins , which provided a sufficient penalty to suppress the lamellar state degeneracy and still allowed one to retain the periodic boundary conditions which minimize finite size effects .",
    "the phase structure of the hamiltonian in eq.([e1 ] ) has been explored by both monte carlo @xcite and cluster - variational ( cvpam ) methods @xcite with similar results : there is a single transition from a paramagnetic high temperature phase to ( with appropriate boundary conditions in the monte carlo case ) a ferromagnetic phase .",
    "the transition point appears to be independent of @xmath0 for @xmath0 sufficiently large .",
    "the transition is continuous for these values of @xmath0 .",
    "the critical indices are also independent of @xmath0 . however , in the vicinity of @xmath21 , where the model displays an additional `` antiferromagnetic '' symmetry ,",
    "the transition becomes first order @xcite .",
    "a modified mean - field approach @xcite also predicts the same phase structure , but underestimates @xmath22 and gives a much stronger variation of @xmath22 with @xmath0 than is seen in the simulations and cvpam approach .",
    "it was suggested in @xcite that consideration of a larger space of coupling constants for the terms in eq.([e1 ] ) indicated that the observed exponents were effective exponents arising from the proximity of the transition point to the critical end point of a paramagnetic - ferromagnetic line .",
    "it was remarked in earlier work by savvidy et.al .",
    "@xcite that @xmath22 was close to that of the standard two - dimensional ising model with nearest neighbour interactions on a square lattice and the simulations in @xcite found @xmath23 , close to the onsager 2d ising value of 1.75 .",
    "these authors also found @xmath24 is inadvertently transposed with @xmath25 in @xcite . ] , not far off the 2d ising value @xmath26 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath27 was estimated to be a lot smaller than the onsager value of 0.125 .",
    "direct and finite size scaling fits on the specific heat data in @xcite for @xmath3 were not very reliable due to the presence of the unknown analytic part in the specific heat , which leads to an extra adjustable parameter in the fits .",
    "part of the motivation for the current work was to obtain an alternative estimator for @xmath3 that sidestepped these problems .",
    "another factor was the apparent impossibility of finding discretized surface models exhibiting a proper scaling of the string tension .",
    "the ordinary 3d ising model has a scaling string tension , but it is unclear to which continuum surface model it corresponds .",
    "it is thus interesting to find equally simple models with different scaling properties particularly if , as for the one presented here , they have a nice geometrical interpretation .",
    "an additional reason to undertake this project was that , if present , the string tension in the gonihedric models should be entirely generated by fluctuations , so the simulations allow one to confirm that the standard scaling ansatze still apply in such a case .",
    "finally , the behaviour of the string tension is an excellent indicator of a first order transition , so a simulation at , or around , @xmath21 can confirm the first order nature of the transition in this case .",
    "we have hypothesized in @xcite that the apparent impossibility of defining a continuum limit for  ghost \" surfaces ( @xmath21 implies no self - avoidance ) may be related to the fact that eq .",
    "( [ e4a ] ) leads to problems if @xmath28 , which the ising discretization naively corresponds to .",
    "we now move on to discuss the measurement of the surface tension and extraction of estimates for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "normally when one is trying to measure a string tension in an ising like model it is sufficient to use anti - periodic boundary conditions in one direction because this guarantees the presence of an interface .",
    "the string tension can then be defined by the difference between the bulk partition function @xmath29 and the partition function with an interface @xmath30 @xmath31 where we have assumed that we have a square interface spanning an @xmath32 boundary . however , as we have seen , the gonihedric ising models possess a symmetry which allows planes of spins to be flipped at no energy cost , so antiperiodic boundary conditions are insufficient to force an interface .",
    "something more coercive , in the form of the fixed , or perhaps more accurately `` mixed '' , plus and minus spin boundary conditions shown in fig.1a is necessary in order to make sure an interface exists .",
    "the fixed spins on the faces make sure that any flipped spin planes will be penalized by a boundary energy and thus discouraged . while this has the disadvantage of greater finite size effects than antiperiodic boundaries one can also use fixed boundary conditions in calculating the `` bulk '' contribution @xmath29 , but now with all spins plus in order to eliminate the interface as shown in fig1b .",
    "the string tension is given by a ratio of free energies , so there should be a degree of cancellation in the finite size effects for @xmath29 and @xmath30 .    in practice one can not measure a partition function or free energy directly in the simulations , so one considers the derivative of the string tension with respect to @xmath27 , which gives the ( internal ) energy difference between configurations with and without an interface .",
    "@xmath33 where we have denoted the mixed boundary conditions that give the interface by @xmath34 and the fixed boundary conditions by @xmath35 and the @xmath36 s are energy densities .",
    "the volume of the system is @xmath37 .",
    "if @xmath38 , the standard finite size scaling behaviour for the specific heat @xmath39 and the relation @xmath40 mean that one would expect @xmath41 where the constant @xmath42 has its origin in the regular term in the specific heat and would be expected to appear for both sets of boundary conditions .",
    "a measurement of the energy with a single set of boundary conditions thus gains nothing over specific heat measurements as there is still a constant term @xmath42 .",
    "however , if one considers both mixed and fixed boundary conditions one would expect the _ same _ regular part @xmath42 for both sets .",
    "a measurement of the energy difference therefore eliminates @xmath42 and a simple power law fit to @xmath43 determines the exponent @xmath44 .",
    "similar methods have been used to extract @xmath3 for the heisenberg model by holm and janke @xcite .    in order to extract further estimates from our simulations we also considered the standard scaling ansatz @xcite for the string tension on an asymmetric lattices .",
    "then @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "this gives directly @xmath47 so at the critical point @xmath48 for @xmath49 we simulated lattices with various aspect ratios , @xmath50 , and adjusted the exponent @xmath44 in a plot of @xmath51 in order to attempt to obtain a smooth scaling function @xmath52 .",
    "the `` best '' curve then gives an estimate of @xmath53 .",
    ", @xmath54 , so the two definitions of @xmath44 we have given are equivalent . ]",
    "the approach can also be used on symmetric lattices away from the critical point as , referring to eq.([de ] ) when @xmath38 , we can see that @xmath55 plotted against @xmath56 should collapse the data for various lattice sizes and temperatures to give a smooth scaling function for the correct choice of @xmath4 .",
    "the simulations were carried out on symmetric lattices of size @xmath57 and @xmath58 for @xmath59 . for @xmath49 lattices with various aspect ratios of sizes",
    "@xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , .... @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 were used .",
    "similar sizes were considered for @xmath21 and @xmath71 .",
    "we carried out from 50k up to 1000k measurement sweeps after allowing a suitable amount of time for thermalization , depending on the value of @xmath27 and the lattice sizes .",
    "we used the tried and tested code from @xcite . which performs a simple metropolis update .",
    "it is worth remarking that although the gonihedric action contains competing interactions it might be worthwhile formulating a cluster update for the model as there is no frustration present .",
    "the magnetization , energy , susceptibility , specific heat and various cumulants were are all measured in the standard fashion . for each lattice size we simulated separately with fixed and mixed boundary conditions in order to allow us to measure @xmath72 from the combined results .",
    "taking , for example , the @xmath59 results on symmetric lattices , we find that the curve of @xmath72 displays a maximum , which we use as our estimator for the pseudo - critical point .",
    "the values of @xmath73 at the appropriate pseudocritical points are shown in table.1 .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     table.2 : data used in fitting @xmath74 for @xmath59 .",
    "for @xmath49 on asymmetric lattices we perform a finite - size scaling analysis similar to the one employed in determining the string tension scaling .",
    "we search for a universal scaling function @xmath75 by adjusting the value of @xmath5 in a plot of @xmath76 .",
    "the smoothest function is also obtained when @xmath77 , in excellent agreement with the @xmath78 result . the function @xmath79 is plotted in fig.7 . to show the sensitivity of the method , we also plot @xmath79 for @xmath80 which gives a markedly less smooth curve .    a final word of warning :",
    "while the estimates obtained are rather higher than the 1.79(4 ) in @xcite for @xmath74 at @xmath59 it should be remembered that a different set of boundary conditions ( periodic , with fixed _ internal _ spin planes ) was used there , and that these might be expected to cause less severe finite size effects for magnetic quantities .",
    "the fixed boundary conditions do even more violence to the magnetization itself and we could obtain no reliable estimates for either the magnetization exponent @xmath27 or @xmath81 from finite size scaling , in contrast to the periodic boundaries and fixed internal spin planes in @xcite .",
    "as we have already noted , from the results it is clear that the 2d and 3d ising values for @xmath44 of @xmath82 and @xmath83 are definitively excluded .",
    "this shows that the hypothesis floated in @xcite that the critical behaviour of the model might be related to that of the standard 2d ising model is not supported by the numerical evidence .",
    "there is good agreement between the various methods we have used to extract the energetic exponents ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) .",
    "the data collapse on both symmetric and asymmetric lattices suggests that @xmath84 for both @xmath49 and @xmath2 and ( via both hyperscaling and directly from the data collapse ) @xmath4 is in the region of @xmath85 .",
    "we find a value around @xmath86 for @xmath74 from the finite size scaling of the susceptibility , which implies a smaller value of @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) than that estimated in @xcite . as we have noted , the estimate for @xmath87 from the cvpam calculations @xcite is similarly small .",
    "the set of exponents we have arrived are consistent with @xmath89 .",
    "in addition hyperscaling , @xmath90 , appears to be happily satisfied by the measured values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the first order nature of the transition for small @xmath0 is also manifest in the sharp spike in the measurements of @xmath72 at @xmath22 for @xmath91 .",
    "it is interesting that a similar value of @xmath92 appears in the vicinity of the disorder variety for the anisotropic triangular lattice ising model @xcite .",
    "the blte and hilhorst transcription of the anisotropic triangular lattice ising model as a diamond covering of the lattice is particularly intriguing from our viewpoint . in this formulation",
    "the model can be viewed as a perspective view from the @xmath93 direction of a cubic lattice sos model .",
    "the excitations in the model appear as steps , or strings of flipped diamonds in the perspective view of an otherwise flat surface .",
    "it is noteworthy that the weights which appear in their model are identical to weights for a restricted class of surface configurations in the gonihedric ising model , namely : steps of height one ; no right angled bends ; no overhangs ; and @xmath94 ( one of their parameters ) zero .",
    "similar @xmath92 singularities appear in related dimer problems @xcite which can be formulated as hexagonal lattice vertex models .",
    "indeed , it is possible to write down a vertex model that represents the full gonihedric set of surface configurations as viewed from a @xmath93 perspective but this does not appear to be soluble .",
    "haldane and villain @xcite have pointed out that a square root singularity would be expected to appear generically in systems with string - like , or striped , excitations in two dimensions .",
    "given the values of @xmath3 that we have estimated from the string tension scaling here , it is not inconceivable that we have a three dimensional realization of these ideas in the gonihedric ising model .",
