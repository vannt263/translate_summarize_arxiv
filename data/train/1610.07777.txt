    "let us discuss the computational complexity inherent to a randomized dce - like evolution .",
    "so far we have seen how dce implemented in a two - coupled superconducting resonator system acts a quantum simulator of gbs by virtue of simple red- and blue - sideband dynamics .",
    "however , one could think of a more general scenario , in which the squid is fed with a multimode magnetic field @xmath100 implementing a hamiltonian dynamics of of the form @xmath101 which resembles a generalized boson sampling hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "it is not difficult to realize that the generalized anger - jacobi expansion yields a one - to - one relation between the external field amplitudes @xmath102 and the coefficients @xmath103 in terms of multivariate normal moments @xcite . using this mapping , and provided",
    "that the magnetic field amplitudes @xmath102 are drawn from a random haar measure , we conclude that a randomized dce - like evolution lies outside the complexity class @xmath104 , thus implementing a classically hard task .    while cutting edge signal generators are capable of creating train pulses with hundreds of frequencies , and resonators allocating hundreds of modes have been developed @xcite , a sufficiently large randomized dce experiment that exhibit quantum supremacy @xcite seems challenging due to the current limitation in resonator lifetimes and frequency - resolving measurements .",
    "however , we believe that this remarkable implication about the dce computational complexity will trigger the forthcoming development of dce - like experiments .      in summary , we have shown how to use the dce in order to implement a gbs device .",
    "we propose a setup consisting of two superconducting transmission line resonators with different energy spectra that are coupled by a squid .",
    "the ultrafast modulation of the magnetic field fed into the squid by an external pump plays the role of relativistic motion of a mirror shared by the two resonators .",
    "the corresponding bogoliubov transformation results into multimode parametric amplification .",
    "we show how a suitable choice of parameters allows to implement gbs and in particular scattershot bs , thus demonstrating that dce can be used to implement a classically hard task .",
    "moreover , we show that randomised dce - like dynamics is itself classically hard .",

    "<S> in addition to its fundamental interest , it has been shown that the radiation generated in the dce displays entanglement and other forms of quantum correlations @xcite , which poses the question of its utility as a resource for the heralded quantum technological revolution . </S>",

    "<S> bs has recently gained a great deal of attention , as it solves a tailor - made problem the problem of sampling from the output distribution of photons in a linear - optics network that is widely believed to be intractable in any classical device . </S>",

    "<S> we consider gaussian bs ( gbs ) and in particular scattershot bs , a generalization of the original bs problem which is known to be equivalent in terms of computational complexity @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the resonators possess different lengths and thus different energy spectra and the squid plays the role of a shared tunable mirror - like boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> the modulation of the external magnetic flux threading the squid implements an effective motion of the mirror whose corresponding bogoliubov transformation results in multimode parametric amplification . we show that suitable choices of the squid pumping are able to implement the operations of a gbs -namely two - mode squeezers , beam - splitters and phase shifters . in this way , we show how the dce can be exploited as a quantum simulator of gbs . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we will discuss how dce is by itself a physical effect that is hard to simulate on a classical computer .    </S>",

    "<S> ultrafast variation of the magnetic flux threading the squid amounts to motion of the mirror at relativistic speeds , which generates a two - mode squeezing operation on the microwave field propagating along the transmission line . in particular , for an initial vacuum field state the modulation of the boundary condition results in generation of pairs of photons , a process which is resonantly enhanced if the mirror moves at a frequency matching the sum of the frequencies of the emitted photons .    </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the dce can be produced as well for different boundary conditions , such as the ones of a superconducting resonator interrupted by one @xcite or two @xcite squids . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we can think of the dce as a particular instance of multimode parametric amplification induced by the modulation of boundary conditions , as we shall see in the following .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a one - dimensional ( 1d ) superconducting resonator in the presence of one or two movable boundary conditions . in the absence of any flux modulation , the resonator field @xmath8 </S>",
    "<S> is characterised by a set of creation and annihilation operators @xmath9 associated to the set of solutions @xmath10 of the 1d massless klein - gordon wave equation plane waves  with the corresponding boundary conditions  e.g. the well - known standing waves in the case of a perfect resonator@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the modulation of the squids changes the boundary conditions of the field , generating a new set of solutions @xmath11 and the corresponding new set of operators @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> both sets are related by means of a bogoliubov transformation : @xmath13 where the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath14 are given by the inner product : @xmath15 therefore , they depend on the particular initial boundary conditions -which determine the functions @xmath16- and the particular type of boundary modulation -which determine the functions @xmath17 . in the case of small boundary oscillations characterised by a dimensionless amplitude @xmath18 , the bogoliubov coefficients can be computed perturbatively in a variety of a cases including single- @xcite and two - wall oscillations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more general continuous motion of the two walls , such as the one required to mimic the motion of an accelerated cavity which is rigid in its proper frame , can also be addressed perturbatively @xcite . in all these cases , </S>",
    "<S> the bogoliubov coefficients depend on the features of the boundary modulation , for instance , the number of external pumps , together with their corresponding frequencies and durations .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that the set @xmath19 characterizes phase - shifting ( @xmath20 ) and beam - splitting ( @xmath21 ) among the modes , while @xmath22 generates two - mode squeezing . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we conclude that the modulation of the boundary conditions of a superconducting resonator is equivalent to a multimode parametric amplifier consisting of a set of tunable phase shifters , beam splitters and two - mode squeezers , which can be adjusted by suitably selecting the number , frequency and duration of external pumps .    </S>",
    "<S> a remarkable example is the dce , where a modulation of frequency @xmath6 generates bogoliubov coefficients @xmath23 growing linearly in time only for the modes in a resonance condition @xmath24 -all the other bogoliubov coefficients being negligible . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , another resonance frequency @xmath25 would make the corresponding @xmath26 to increase linearly in time @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , a series of operations of this kind with suitable frequencies and duration times can generate a desired combination of beam splitters and two - mode squeezers . in the following </S>",
    "<S> , we will show how to use this scheme to implement a gbs protocol ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : name]a )  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an important problem to overcome is how to generate beam splitters only between a selected pair of modes , which is impossible in a single harmonic resonator . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we will consider a pair of resonators of different lengths -thus with different energy spectrum- confining two resonator fields @xmath4 , @xmath3 and sharing a tunable mirror ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : name1]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we need to choose incommensurate lengths </S>",
    "<S> .    therefore the collection of modes @xmath27 consists of two collections of modes @xmath28 given by the solutions to the klein - gordon 1d equation - plane waves- after imposing dirichlet boundary conditions at points , say @xmath29 , @xmath30 for @xmath31 and @xmath30 , @xmath0 for @xmath32 : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the propagation speed of the field .    </S>",
    "<S> the collection of modes @xmath36 is given by the transformed solutions of the field confined in both resonators when the common mirror -initially placed at @xmath37- undergoes an effective harmonic motion of frequency @xmath6 and amplitude @xmath5 , given by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a dimensionless small parameter . </S>",
    "<S> then we can obtain the bogoliubov coefficients as a perturbative expansion in @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the first order of the expansion will be given by @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41,@xmath42 are the frequencies of the modes @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively and @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the bogoliubov coefficients associated to the transformation induced by a single change of mirror position @xmath47 at @xmath48 . then : @xmath49 now , if we select a mode @xmath31 in the left cavity and a mode @xmath50 in the right cavity : @xmath51 we find that : @xmath52    by inspection of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bogost]),we see that bogoliubov coefficients oscillate in time , unless the pumping frequency @xmath6 is either @xmath53 or @xmath54 in the former case the corresponding @xmath55 contain a term that grows monotonically in time , while in the latter the same happens for @xmath56 . in both alternative scenarios , after a time @xmath57 , we can neglect all the oscillations , so we can assume that only the resonant terms are non - zero . </S>",
    "<S> in the first case ( by simplicity , we assume @xmath58 ) : @xmath59 while in the second one we obtain exactly the same expression for @xmath56 , with a minus sign on the front .    </S>",
    "<S> notice that in our setup , the difference or sum of two mode frequencies when the modes correspond to different resonators is different for each pair . </S>",
    "<S> thus eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : bogospartexp ] ) and the corresponding expression for the @xmath56 illustrate the ability of implementing a beam splitter or a two - mode squeezer between a pair of selected modes by means of a suitable choice of the pumping frequency @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the magnitude of the bogoliubov coefficients can be adjusted with the choice of the amplitude @xmath5 and duration @xmath60 of the oscillation .     </S>",

    "<S> the distinct modulation of the external magnetic flux @xmath7 amounts to blue ( i ) or red ( ii ) sidebands that implements both initial state and unitary dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> the sequential repetition of frequency - resolved power measurements at the output of the resonators ( iii ) allows us to reconstruct the probability distribution @xmath61 . ]    </S>",

    "<S> , we can think of a setup in which half of the output of @xmath62 two - mode squeezers are input into a linear network of @xmath62 optical modes , while the other half is sent directly to single photon detectors . </S>",
    "<S> then , @xmath63 single photons are detected in the latter half . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in @xcite this device is able to solve a randomized version of bs known as scattershot bs , which possesses similar computational complexity as the original problem @xcite , and therefore is widely believed to be out of reach classically . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the necessary optical operators are : i ) two - mode squeezers for the preparation of the initial state , ii ) , beam splitters and phase shifters for the implementation of the linear network @xcite and iii ) , single photon detectors .    the results of the previous section suggest that superconducting circuits are particularly suitable for implementing the above operators . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we propose multimode coupled resonators as laid out in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b , to prepare two - mode squeezed states between arbitrary modes @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and realize beam - splitting operations among the modes . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by time - evolving the coupled resonators under circuit hamiltonian @xmath66 where the normal modes @xmath67 have frequencies @xmath68 , being @xmath69 the size of the resonator and @xmath70 the speed of light in the coplanar waveguide- @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the inductance and capacitance per unit length , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> , the circuit hamiltonian can be written in the interaction picture as @xmath80 an external magnetic field through the squid @xmath81 , with @xmath82 given by ( 9 ) , yields the effective hamiltonian @xmath83 that implements a two - mode squeezing operation between modes @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where the squeezing coefficient @xmath84 results from jacobi - anger expansion , which is indeed the bogoliubov coefficient @xmath23 in equation ( [ eq : bogospart ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sequential evolution under ( 13 ) for distinct pair of modes @xmath85 and the different frequencies @xmath82 results in the preparation of the desired initial state @xmath86 , where @xmath87 , and the squeezing operator @xmath88 results from the time evolution under the hamiltonian @xcite .    similarly , pumping the squid with a field @xmath89 at the frequency @xmath90 given by ( 8) results in a red sideband hamiltonian @xmath91 that implements beam splitting and phase shifting operations between modes @xmath92 .. ] the coupling coefficient @xmath93 and can be cast into the form ( [ eq : bogospartexp ] ) . as shown by reck et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , any unitary operator @xmath94 can be decomposed in these passive linear operations , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 , and @xmath97 connects nearest neighbor modes . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the circuit depth can be reduced to @xmath98 by implementing non - local beam - splitters @xcite , which can be naturally implemented in our proposal . </S>",
    "<S> this has the advantage of reducing the number of operations considerably .    </S>",
    "<S> the final step of the protocol , after evolving under red and blue side hamiltoninans , is reading out the number of photons in the resonators . to extract the photon - number information , we perform frequency - resolved power measurements @xcite , scanning the output power that leaks out from the resonators at the different frequencies @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> each recorded sequence corresponds to a single run in a normal boson sampling experiment . </S>",
    "<S> repetition of the whole protocol ( steps i , ii and iii up to a desired number runs , results in the sampling from the probability distribution @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is worth mentioning that our proposal is , in principle , robust as far as scalability is concerned . </S>",
    "<S> this is so , as the proposed architecture only needs to increase the number of different frequency modes in the resonators , without increasing the physical resources . </S>"
