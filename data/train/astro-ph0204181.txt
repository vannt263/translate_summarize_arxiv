    "the gravitationally lensed qso apm 08279 + 5255 ( z@xmath3=3.911 ) has been given much attention since its discovery by irwin et al .",
    "there are two major gravitationally lensed images `` a '' and `` b '' with a separation of 038 and flux ratio of f@xmath12/f@xmath13=0.77 ( ibata et al .",
    "third faint image `` c '' was also reported by ibata et al .",

    "petitjean et al . ( 2000 ) suggested a probable damped lyman-@xmath8 ( dla ) system at z@xmath7=2.974 which has 19.8 @xmath15 log n(hi ) [ @xmath16 @xmath15 20.3 from data obtained with keck hires ( ellison et al .",
    "1999a , b ) . the low metallicity ( [ x / h ] @xmath10 -2.3 ) derived from weak metal lines ( fe , al , si , c and o ) suggest a very small dust amount in the cloud . thus , this dla system is an important object which supports the idea that there may be a metallicity evolution of dla in z @xmath9 3 ( see discussions in petitjean et al .",
    "2000 , pettini et al . 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "another interest of the dla system is any difference of absorption features in the line of sight to the images a , b , and c. the small separation of a - b , which is estimated at @xmath10 200h@xmath17 pc ( petitjean et al .",
    "2000 ) , gives us a unique opportunity to investigate small ( @xmath15 1 kpc ) spatial structure of dla systems at high - z .",
    "a systematic study of small - scale structure of high - ionization gas ( ) at high redshift was performed by rauch et al .",
    "( 2001 ) by observing a number of gravitationally lensed qsos with keck hires .",
    "they found clouds do not seem to have small scale structure for regions smaller than a few hundred parsecs .",
    "lopez et al . ( 1999 ) also show that is spread out over large scales .    however , there is a strong interest in lower - ionization clouds since they trace the neutral hydrogen gas ( e.g. , wolfe & prochaska 2000a ) which should be the source of star - forming molecular clouds .",
    "if high - z dlas are the progenitor of the present - day disk galaxies ( e.g. , storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 and references therein ) , the spatial - structure of low - ionization clouds gives us insights into how the `` protogalaxies '' are assembled from building blocks ( e.g. , haehnelt , steinmetz , & rauch 1998 , wolfe & prochaska 2000b ) .",
    "although rauch et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found a strong variation of low - ionization and absorption at z @xmath18 3.538 along two sight - lines separated by only 26h@xmath19 pc for q1422 + 231 ( z@xmath20 3.628 ) , it can not be excluded that the system is somehow associated with the quasar as discussed by rauch et al .",
    "( 1999 ) because the velocity difference between the qso and the system is only 6000 km s@xmath11 .",
    "absorption lines are one of the most promising probes for studying such low - ionization clouds ( churchill & vogt 2001 ) . the @xmath5 2796,2803 doublet absorption lines are most noted as being associated with galaxies ( bergeron & boiss 1991 ; steidel , dickinson & persson 1994 ) and its kinematics for low to intermediate redshift dlas are comprehensively studied ( churchill & vogt 2001 and references therein ) .",
    "however , there has been no detailed absorption line study for high - redshift ( z @xmath9 2.5 ) dlas because doublet absorption line shifts into the near - infrared ( @xmath21 1 ) in the observer s frame and until recently there has been no capability of high - resolution near - infrared spectroscopy with a large aperture telescope .",
    "here we present near - infrared 1.02@xmath01.16@xmath1 m spectra of apm 08279 + 5255 with 40@xmath045 km s@xmath11 spectral resolutoin , obtained with the near - infrared spectrograph ircs at the subaru telescope . in this rest - frame uv spectra , we have detected doublet and absorption lines originated from the dla system at z@xmath7=2.974 .",
    "although future higher resolution ( @xmath15 10 km s@xmath11 ) study is in order , the present data gives us a variety of information on the dla system with reasonable signal - to - noise .",
    "also , a difference of the absorption lines between the images a and b was clearly detected in our spectrum under excellent seeing condition .",
    "in the following ,  2 describes the observation and  3 describes the results and preliminary analysis .",
    "near - infrared 1.02@xmath01.18@xmath1 m spectra of apm 08279 + 5255 were obtained on 11 january 2001 ut during the scientific commissioning run of ircs , a 1@xmath05@xmath4 near - infrared camera and spectrograph at the japanese subaru 8.2 m telescope ( tokunaga et al .",
    "1998 , kobayashi et al .",
    "2000 ) on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "we used the cross - dispersed echelle mode of ircs , which provides a spectral resolution of 15 km s@xmath11 ( @xmath22 20,000 ) with a 0.15-arcsec slit .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.075-arcsec per pixel in spatial direction and about 7.5 km s@xmath11 per pixel in the dispersion direction .",
    "the entire ircs `` zj - band '' ( 1.02@xmath01.18@xmath1 m ) was covered simultaneously in one exposure with the cross - disperser used in order 6 and the echelle in order 48 to 55 .",
    "although seeing was good throughout the observing time ( 03 to 055 in zj - band ) , we used a wider slit ( 06 ) to maximize the throughput of the slit .",
    "thus , the spectral resolution was determined by the seeing size and the resultant spectral resolution was 40 @xmath0 45 km s@xmath11 ( @xmath22 7,000 ) in the observed wavelength range .",
    "the slit length was 3.8-arcsec and the slit angle was set to p.a .",
    "@xmath18 32@xmath23 so that both the lensed images a and b are in the slit .",
    "the object was nodded along the slit by about 2@xmath24 after a 300 sec exposure for sky - background and dark subtraction . because of the fine pixel scale needed for adaptive optics images and the high spectral resolution , it is impossible to reach the background - limit within a single exposure ( 300@xmath0600 sec ) which was less than the time - variation of the sky oh - emission .",
    "four sets of data were obtained , resulting in a total exposure time of 2400 sec .",
    "spectra of bright telluric standard stars ( hr 4905 : a0p , hr 5191 : b3v ) at similar airmass were obtained in similar fashion , but only hd 5191 was used in the following analysis because hd 4905 had several unidentified stellar absorption lines .",
    "the obesrving log is shown in table 1 . although we started the observing right after focusing the secondary mirror of the telescope , the image quality had gradually changed during the observing due to a seeing change from 030 to 055 in zj - band in an hour .",
    "thus , we had good image quality only for the first few frames , in which we could resolve the images a and b with 038 separation in the echellogram ( discussed in detail in  3.2 ) .",
    "all the data were reduced following standard procedures using the iraf noao.imred.echelle package : sky subtraction ( subtraction of two frames ) , flat - fielding ( halogen lamp with an integrating sphere ) , and aperture extraction .",
    "argon lamp spectra which were taken at the end of the observing night were used for wavelength calibration . using atmospheric absorption lines in the object and standard spectra",
    ", we confirmed that the pixel shift along the dispersion direction was less than 1-pixel throughout the observing time including the calibration .",
    "figure 1 shows 1.02@xmath01.16@xmath1 m spectrum of apm 08279 + 5255 .",
    "the raw spectrum was smoothed to 3 pixels ( 22.5 km s@xmath11 ) with a boxcar function for better signal - to - noise .",
    "strong @xmath52796,2803 absorption lines as well as @xmath62587 and @xmath62600 absorption lines from the dla system at z@xmath25 2.974 are clearly seen in this spectrum .",
    "@xmath62853 absorption line is probably detected at the expected wavelength for the redshift , but qutantitative numbers for this line should be taken with cautions because of the strong atmospheric absorption lines at 1.12@xmath01.15 .",
    "the detected absorption lines are summarized in table 2 . because the equivalent width ratio w(2796)/w(2803 ) is about 1.4 , the @xmath62796 absorption line should have saturated velocity components .",
    "@xmath62600 may be also saturated judging from the relatively deep absorption of our low resolution spectrum .",
    "petitjean et al . ( 2000 ) showed that the @xmath61608 absorption line has 40% absorption at the core of the line with @xmath108 km s@xmath11 resolution .",
    "because the oscillator strength of @xmath62600 ( f@xmath180.2239 ; morton 1991 ) is about three times larger than that of @xmath61608 ( f@xmath180.064408 ; savage & sembach 1996 ) , the @xmath62600 line is most likely partly saturated .",
    "the column density and metallicity of , , and estimated from the equivalent widths are also summarized in table 2 . in view of the large equivalent widths , @xmath62600",
    ", @xmath52796,2803 lines should be saturated ( see examples in churchill et al .",
    "1999 , churchill et al . 2000a and",
    "churchill et al .",
    "thus , the estimated column densities for those lines are a lower - limit .",
    "we assumed that @xmath62587 , @xmath62583 lines are not saturated .",
    "the following equation for optically thin limit from savage and sembach ( 1996 ) was used for estimating the column densities : n[@xmath16 @xmath18 1.13 @xmath26 10@xmath27 w[m ] @xmath28 ( f @xmath29[ ] ) , where @xmath6 is rest wavelength , f is oscillator strength , and w is equivalent width of the line .",
    "the estimated metallicity of and in table 1 is consistent with the result for other metal lines in petitjean et al ( 2000 ) , supporting their conclusion that the dla system has quite low - metallicity ( [ x / h ]",
    "@xmath10 -2.0 @xmath0 -2.5 ) and may suggest the system s `` young '' nature compared to lower - redshift dla systems ( petitjean et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the line profile of doublet and @xmath62600 absorption lines on a velocity scale with the origin at z@xmath7=2.9740 . in our spectrum ,",
    "all three lines show two major velocity components at v @xmath10 -10 km s@xmath11 ( hereafter `` main component '' ) and",
    "@xmath10 + 45 km s@xmath11 ( hereafter `` subcomponent '' ) .",
    "gaussian fit to the two components was performed for doublet and @xmath62600 using iraf _",
    "splot _ task ( table 2 ) .",
    "we did not use voigt profile fitting because the spectral resolution is not high enough to extract high precision information .",
    "we performed a simple gaussian fitting with maximum two components and the decomposition of absorption lines is only approximate .",
    "the fitted gaussian fwhm suggests that the main component has a velocity spread no more than 80 km s@xmath11 .",
    "the main component should be saturated for both @xmath5 2796 , 2803 and probably for @xmath6 2600 .",
    "the subcomponent is weaker , but the equivalent width ratio of the doublet is w@xmath30(2796)/w@xmath30(2803 ) @xmath31 1 and this may suggest that the subcomponent is saturated .",
    "the relatively large equivalent width ( w@xmath320.1 ) also suggests that at least @xmath62796 line is saturated ( churchill & vogt 2001 ) .",
    "petitjean et al ( 2000 ) identified three major velocity components at around -28 km s@xmath11 , + 5 km s@xmath11 , and + 45 km s@xmath11 for 10 metal absorption lines in keck hires data with velocity resolution of @xmath108 km s@xmath11 . because petitjean et al .",
    "2000 does not list the velocity of the three components , we estimated the velocity from the vertical lines in their figure 12 .",
    "an additional velocity components may be present between -28 and + 5 km s@xmath11 components in their figure 12 and , in particular , it is clearly seen in al ii @xmath61670 absorption spectrum . with lower spectral resolution , three velocity components ( -28 km s@xmath11 , -10 km s@xmath11 , + 5 km s@xmath11 ) should be blended and the peak position would shift to about -10 km s@xmath11 .",
    "thus , we identified our `` main component '' as the mixture of those three components in petitjean et al .",
    "their + 45 km s@xmath11 component coincides with our `` subcomponent '' seen in @xmath5 2796,2803 and @xmath62600 absorption lines .",
    "the identification is summarized in table 3 .      because the seeing was less than 04 at the beginning of observing , two images of the gravitationally lensed qso , a and b with 038 separation , were resolved in the first three frames of 300 sec exposure ( see  2 and table 1 ) . in all the three frames",
    "it was noticed that only image a has the `` subcomponent '' at + 45 km s@xmath11 while both have the `` main component '' in common at around -10 km s@xmath11 ( figure 3 ) .",
    "we combined those three frames and extracted spectra of a and b separately to examine any difference of the dla absorption lines .",
    "extracted spectra for a and b ( figure 4 ) also show the difference clearly .",
    "figure 5 shows the cross - cuts of the combined spectrum in spatial direction .",
    "the light grey line shows continuum profile on both sides of the absorption lines while dark grey line shows the profile at + 45 km s@xmath11 component . in this plot",
    "it is clearly shown that image a has significantly less flux at + 45 km s@xmath11 than at the continuum while image b has almost similar flux as at the continuum",
    ". a slight dip of the dark grey line near image c may suggest that the flux from image c also sigfinicantly decreased at + 45 km s@xmath11 .",
    "however , that is not clear because the spatial resolution ( @xmath10035 ) is not enough for the small separation between a and c ( 015 ) .",
    "therefore , we performed a gaussan fitting to the spatial profiles for @xmath62796 line ( figure 6 ) .",
    "the continuum profile was fitted well with the combination of three gaussians at a , b , and c positions with the exact flux ratio as in ibata et al .",
    "the profile at + 45 km s@xmath11 was well fitted similarly with 50% less flux for a and 80% less flux for c ( see black lines in the right panel ) .",
    "we tried to fit the + 45 km s@xmath11 profile without decreasing the c flux , but could not reproduce the dip at c - position well ( see grey lines in the same panel ) .",
    "this result suggests that the + 45 km s@xmath11 component is present also in image c and significantly decrease the flux from c. however , in view of the uncertainty of the profile data ( see e.g. , the difference of two continuum profiles for 2796 line , which indicates the uncertainty of the profile in figure 5 ) , the fitting results for image c should be treated with caution . in a summary",
    ", we conclude that : ( 1 ) image b does not have any absorption from the + 45 km s@xmath11 component , ( 2 ) image a has @xmath1050% absorption from the + 45 km s@xmath11 component , ( 3 ) image c may have very strong absorption from the + 45 km s@xmath11 component .    because the estimated distance between images a and b of apm 08279 + 5255 is only 200h@xmath17 pc at the redshift of the z@xmath182.974 dla system ( petitjean et al .",
    "2000 ) , our results suggest that there is a small - scale structure ( @xmath15 200 pc ) in the dla system .",
    "figure 5 shows that the fractional change in column density of the subcomponent from a to b is almost 1 , suggesting a sharp cut - off of this subcomponent .",
    "if the strong absorption from the subcomponent truly exists in c as suggested from the above analysis , it sets a lower limit on the size of the absorbing cloud of @xmath1080h@xmath17 pc , which corresponds to the separation of a and c (= 015 ) . for high - ion clouds ,",
    "rauch et al . ( 2001 ) found that they are mostly featureless on scales below @xmath10 300 pc and the fractional change in column density is mostly less than 0.2 for such small scales ( see figures 8 & 9 in rauch et al .",
    "our results suggest that low - ionization clouds may have finer structure than high - ionization clouds at high - z , but a more systematic study is needed to address this point .",
    "the velocity difference of the subcomponent to the main component is about 50 km s@xmath11 and the subcomponent is classified as `` moderate '' velocity subsystem in the classification of kinematic subsystems by churchill & vogt ( 2001 ) .",
    "the velocity of the subsystem and the equivalent width is well within the ranges for low to intermediate redshift dlas studied by churchill & vogt ( 2001 ) .",
    "they found that the high or moderate velocity subsystem is probably _ not _ higher redshift analogues to the galactic high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) in the halo or intergalactic space because the column density of the substems is too low for hvcs .",
    "churchill & charlton ( 1999 ) found that the subsystems are more like compact clouds which are embedded in extended highly ionized gas like galactic coronae . from the ionization modeling of those clouds",
    ", they inferred the masses and sizes of the clouds at @xmath10 few @xmath26 10 m@xmath33 and @xmath10 few @xmath26 10 @xmath0 100 pc .",
    "their inferred size is consistent with our results for the subsystem of the dla at z@xmath342.974 ( @xmath31 200 pc ) .",
    "although more systematic study is in order , our result presents the first glimpse of small - scale structure of low - ionization clouds in a dla system at high redshift .",
    "we are grateful to all of the ircs team members and the subaru telescope observing staff for their efforts that made it possible to obtain these data .",
    "we thank national astronomical observatory japan for the financial support and encouragement for the construction of the ircs .",
