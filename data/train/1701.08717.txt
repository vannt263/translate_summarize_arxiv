    "multi - station meteor observations have been conducted for several dozen years .",
    "it is a well - tried and proven method for detecting this kind of phenomena , determining their absolute brightness , meteoroid mass , trajectory in the atmosphere , orbital parameters and also calculating the places of meteorite falls . during the last 50 years of 20th century",
    "the european fireball network was leading in this area , with their fully automated photographic stations ( spurn 1997 , spurn et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the _ polish fireball network ( pfn ) _ is the project established in 2004 , which main goal is to constantly monitor the sky over poland in order to detect bright fireballs occurring over the whole territory of the country ( olech et al .",
    "2006 , winiewski et al .",
    "it is run by amateur astronomers associated in _",
    "comets and meteors workshop ( cmw ) _ and coordinated by astronomers from copernicus astronomical center in warsaw , poland .",
    "today there are over 35 fireball stations belonging to _ pfn _ that operate during each clear night . in total over 70 sensitive cctv cameras with fast and wide angle lenses are used .    in this paper",
    "we report an analysis of the multi - station observation of the pf120916 piecki fireball made by cameras of the _ polish fireball network_. the trajectory , orbit and possible area of meteorite fall are calculated .",
    "the pf120916 piecki fireball was observed by six _ pfn _ video stations .",
    "they are listed in table 1 together with their respective coordinates and equipment used for recording the fireball .",
    "the most detailed recording comes from the pfn52 stary sielc station which works using digital full hd ( @xmath6 pix ) camera with recording speed of 25 frames per second .",
    "it captured the meteor almost in the center of the field of view ( see fig .",
    "valuable recordings were also obtained by pfn47 jezirko , pfn72 komin wielkopolski and pfn74 brwinw stations which works in pal resolution @xmath7 with 25 frames per second , offering 0.04 second temporal resolution . data from pfn48 rzeszw",
    "were not included into the calculations due to the location of the station along the trajectory of the fireball , large distance ( almost 500 km ) from the fireball and capturing it through the clouds .",
    "location of the pfn63 d creates substantial other convergence angle with respect to three stations : pfn52 , pfn74 , pfn47 . in spite of this",
    "we did not decide to use its data for computation , mainly because of low image scale .",
    "the pfn63 is all - sky station equipped with circular fish - eye lens .",
    "combination of the vertical field of view of 180 deg with 1200 pixels of vertical resolution gives the image scale of around 9 arc minutes per pixel .",
    "additional reason was large distance ( around 300 km ) from the fireball and capturing only part of its trajectory ( terminal point is missing due to the obstruction near the horizon ) .",
    "table 3 lists also the orbital elements ( taken from the neodys-2 database ) of asteroids with orbits similar to pf120916 piecki fireball .",
    "we selected only bodies with drummond criterion @xmath8 ( drummond 1981 ) .",
    "the largest body from this group is ( 85640 ) 1998 ox4 which size is estimated to be 300 - 600 meters .",
    "it is an apollo group asteroid and a mars crosser .",
    "it is included in the minor planet center list of potentially hazardous asteroids ( phas ) as it comes to within 0.05 au of earth periodically .",
    "similarity of the orbit of piecki fireball to almost all mentioned asteroids seems to be rather accidental .",
    "orbits of such size and shape and with a slight inclination to the ecliptic are characteristic for whole group of apollo type asteroids .",
    "the only interesting case is the 20 - 40 meter size 2014 sh224 asteroid , which passed close to the earth ( @xmath9 au ) on 2016 september 18.94605 ut i.e. only six days after the appearance of the piecki fireball , which indicates that both bodies might be related .",
    "still it is not a decisive argument . to be more certain one need to do a numerical integration of the orbital parameters backwards in time in order to test the link between the fireball and asteroid .",
