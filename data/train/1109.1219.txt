    "how we can describe a pulsar magnetosphere filled with charges and currents ?",
    "since the currents will induce magnetic field perturbation , resulting to a distorted magnetic field relative to dipole field , @xcite described an approximate perturbation field for a pair - starved current flow in the open zone in the frame of static magnetic dipole . in their treatment , the magnetic field is described as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a pure dipole magnetic field anchored into the neutron star ( ns ) , @xmath2 is the perturbation amplitude which determines the strength of the @xmath3 relative to the dipole one , and @xmath3 is the magnetic field generated by the self - consistent electric currents in the domain of the magnetosphere with open field lines , where a singularity exists on the symmetry axis ( details see in @xcite ) .",
    "however , although basic features of the pulsar magnetosphere in a static dipolar magnetic field approximation can be understood , it is more realistic that the magnetosphere be approximated as a rotating inclined magnetic dipole .",
    "the magnetic field lines of a rotating inclined dipole are especially different from those of a static dipole for large inclination angles .",
    "@xcite investigated the magnetic field structure with a current - induced field in the frame of the retarded magnetic dipole .",
    "to apply the solution of @xcite to the retarded dipole , @xcite made following treatments : ( 1 ) shifted the magnetic axis ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) to match that of the swept back dipole ( i.e. mapped the magnetic axis line onto the swept back curve ) and ( 2 ) exponentially tapered the singularity appeared on the symmetry axis so that the field lines can be integrated to determine the last closed field line surface . obviously , such a treatment method is highly simplified .    in this paper , we study the emission patterns and light curves in the pulsar magnetosphere with a current - induced magnetic field perturbation .",

    "it can be seen that the open zone boundary appears two symmetric peaks if the current - induced b perturbation is not included ( i.e. @xmath28 ) .",
    "however , such a symmetry breaks when the current - induced b perturbations is included ( i.e. @xmath46 ) .",
    "for an inclined dipole of constant magnitude , rotating with angular frequency @xmath47 about the @xmath48-axis in which the magnetic field consists of pure retarded dipolar magnetic field and perturbation field , the magnetic moment is @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the magnetic moments of pure retarded dipolar magnetic field @xmath52 and perturbation magnetic field @xmath53 , respectively and the expression are given in appendix b. in such a case , the magnetic field is @xmath54 where the expressions of @xmath52 and @xmath53 are given in appendix b.    in fig . [ fig2 ] , we show the variation of open zone boundary foot - points with phase for the @xmath41 retarded dipole with current - induced perturbations @xmath42 , and @xmath55 for comparison with the results of @xcite . since the rotating effect in the retarded dipole is included , two symmetric peaks disappear even the current - induced b perturbation is not included ( i.e. @xmath28 ) .",
    "this result with @xmath28 is consistent with that of @xcite ( see their top panel of fig .",
    "2 ) , but there is a small difference between our result and the result of @xcite . in fact , the shape of the open zone boundary foot - points depends on not only the magnetic inclination angle but also the pulsar s period , we show the shapes for the periods of crab , vela , and geminga with @xmath56 in fig . [ fig3 ] to account for this fact .",
    "moreover , the cylindrical radius @xmath57 was used in @xcite , but @xmath58 is used in our treatment , leading to the difference . with increasing b perturbation ( i.e. increasing @xmath2 ) , open zone boundary is significantly different from that with @xmath28 , as shown in fig [ fig2 ] .",
    "more importantly , for the singularity in the pair - starved field of @xcite , we use the smooth method of @xcite to deal with it in static dipole field ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) , so this singularity does not exist in retarded dipole field .",
    "however , @xcite took the solution of @xcite , and shifted the magnetic axis to match the retarded dipole by simply mapped the magnetic axis line onto the swept back curve .",
    "therefore , our results with @xmath46 are very different from those given by @xcite .",
    "physically , the perturbation fields with @xmath59 and @xmath60 should have opposite roles on pure retarded dipole field , our results show this property , so we believe that our results are reasonable .    in the retarded dipole ,",
    "the magnetic axis is curved relative to that of pure static dipole . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , we show a three - dimensional view of last closed field lines for a retarded dipole with or without the perturbation field inclined to the rotation axis with angle @xmath61 , where the thick red line marked by a represents the magnetic axis of pure static dipole , and the thick green curved line marked by b represents the magnetic axis of the retarded dipole with the perturbation field ( @xmath62 ) . it can be seen that the perturbation field has an important role in both the shape of the last closed field lines and the magnetic axis .",
    "for example , when @xmath63 , the shape of the last closed field lines becomes more smooth and the magnetic axis is more curved on the side of the magnetic axis of pure retarded dipole ( see top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "in order to determine photon emission from the outer gaps , 3d pulsar s magnetosphere should be simulated and relativistic effects including photon abberation and time - of - flight phase shifts need to be taken into account . the geometry of the photon emission is usually expressed as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the polar angle from the rotation axis and @xmath66 is the phase of rotation of the star .",
    "here we consider the photon emissions from two poles of pulsar magnetosphere and the photon emission geometries in the inertial observer s frame ( iof ) .",
    "the particle motion in the iof is described by @xcite @xmath67{\\bf b}+[\\beta_0{\\rm sin}\\varphi(r)]{\\bf b_{\\bot } } + \\beta_{\\rm co}{\\bf e_\\phi},\\ ] ] where @xmath68 is the pitch angle .",

    "therefore , the emission direction @xmath64 in the iof is @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the azimuthal angle of the emission direction , and * r * is the emitting location in units of the light radius .",
    "we now consider the emission patterns and the examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in this figure",
    ", the emission patterns with @xmath80 , 0 , and -0.1 for @xmath61 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 are given .",
    "for the magnetic field with the perturbation field , the emission patterns is different from those for the pure retarded dipole .",
    "the emission pattern for @xmath63 appears to be more smooth relative to that of the pure retarded dipole , but the emission pattern for @xmath83 is less smooth ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "note that the differences depend on the value of @xmath2 .    before calculating the light curves , we consider the change of the null charge surface with the phase . in the two - pole caustic model of @xcite , photons are emitted uniformly in the gap , and the gap extending from the star surface to high altitudes",
    "is confined to the last open field lines .",
    "@xcite made a revised version of the two - pole caustic model , they pointed out that although acceleration gaps can extend from the star surface to the light cylinder along near the last open field lines , the extension of the gaps along the azimuthal direction is limited because of photon - photon pair production process .",
    "in such gaps , high - energy photons are emitted uniformly and tangentially to the field lines but can not be efficiently produced along these field lines where the distances to the null charge surface are larger than @xmath84 times of the distance of the light cylinder . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , we show the changes of the null charge surface with the phase for @xmath61 but different values of @xmath2 .",
    "it can be seen from this figure that there are substantially difference between the null charge surfaces of the pure retarded dipole with and without the perturbation field , and the difference becomes larger when @xmath2 increases .    in calculating the light curves , we use the method given by @xcite , i.e. the emission region is limited in the range of @xmath85 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the distance from the rotation axis . on the other hand ,",
    "we use the method given by @xcite to smooth the light curves , i.e. the model light curve was calculated for electrons distributed evenly along the polar cap rim ; the density profile across the rim was assumed to be the gaussian function @xmath88 symmetrical about @xmath89 , with @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the magnetic colatitude of magnetic field lines footprints at the star surface , and @xmath92 is the magnetic colatitude of the rim .",
    "we show the light curves in different magnetic inclinations and view angles for @xmath93 , 0.0 , and 0.1 in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , where we have assumed that the inner boundary of the outer gap is located on the stellar surface .",
    "it can be seen that the change of the light curves with @xmath46 is remarkable relative to those with @xmath28 , particularly for larger value of @xmath2 .",
    "compared to the light curves with @xmath28 , the light curves with @xmath46 have following features : ( 1 ) peak shapes is changed although the peak separations are roughly the same , and ( 2 ) the light curves with @xmath63 are more smoothing but those with @xmath59 become more complicated . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we show the light curves predicted in the frame of two pole outer gap model and compare them with observed one of energy region from 0.1 gev to 10 gev of vela pulsar @xcite .",
    "the predicted light curve in the upper panel is calculated in the retarded field without any perturbation , while the lower panel is calculated in the retarded field with a perturbation of @xmath94 . in our calculations for fig.[fig8 ] , the inner boundary of the outer gap is assumed to be the null charge surface , the predicted light curves are mainly produced by the emission of one pole although the contributions of two poles are included when the values of @xmath95 and @xmath65 listed in the figure are used . note that the light curves predicted in @xcite are based on their one pole outer model given by @xcite , we can reproduce their result with @xmath28 in this one pole outer gap model when we used the parameters ( i.e. @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) listed in fig .",
    "5 of @xcite . comparing our results with their results we reached the same conclusion , i.e. that the light curve with @xmath59 is more consistent with the observed one for the vela pulsar",
    "since some currents in the open zone will be created by the radiating charges accelerated in the gaps and the currents will induce the magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is important to study the structure of the magnetic field with the perturbation field , emission patterns , and light curves in pulsar magnetosphere . in this paper",
    ", we derive the solution of the static ( retarded ) magnetic field with the perturbation field in the cartesian coordinates , which can be expressed as the sum of pure static ( retarded ) dipolar magnetic field and the perturbation field in in the cartesian coordinates .",
    "we have confirmed the reliability of our results by using the solution of the static magnetic field with the perturbation field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , and then we have used the solution of the retarded magnetic field with the perturbation field to investigate the emission patterns and light curves in the pulsar magnetosphere ( the parameters of the vela pulsar are used ) .",
    "our results show that the photon emission pattern and light curves for the retarded magnetic field with the perturbation field are changed with respective to those for pure retarded dipolar magnetic field ( see figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "@xcite have studied the emission patterns and light curves of the retarded magnetic field with the perturbation field by using a highly simplified method . however , our method is totally different from their method and the results obtained for these two methods are different ( see figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig8 ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that a more realistic field to describe pulsar magnetosphere is the force free field @xcite , but such a filled magnetosphere lacks the acceleration fields required to produce powerful @xmath98-rays .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the force free field can be approximated as a vacuum dipole field possibly with current - induced perturbation field .",
