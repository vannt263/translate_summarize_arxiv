    "since the pioneering experiments of chang , esaki and tsu @xcite , the tunneling processes in semiconductor heterostructures have attracted great interest . this has been increasing with the development of modern deposition techniques such as metal - organic chemical - vapor deposition ( mocvd ) and molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) that can provide artificial nanostructures .",
    "such structures , coupled to electrical leads , can display many unusual behaviors .",
    "most of works have focalized on electron transport phenomena through heterostructure devices .",
    "the double barrier heterostructure ( dbh ) permits the creation of several kinds of electronic devices such as semiconductor laser diodes , ultra - high - frequency oscillators , and many others @xcite .",
    "one of the most important problems in the study of resonant tunneling in dbh is the e - ph interaction .",
    "after the works of goldman , tsui and cunningham @xcite , it was realized the importance of electron - phonon interaction on the electronic properties of these structures .",
    "however , little importance has been given to the study of the phonons generated in this process , the way they propagate , their decay processes , etc .",
    "our purpose is to study the phonon generation in a dbh under the effect of an external applied bias .",
    "our device consists in a dbh made of _ gaas - algaas_. it was designed in such a way that the difference @xmath4 between the first excited level @xmath5 and the ground state @xmath6 in the well is of the order of the @xmath1 phonon energy @xmath7 , for a small applied bias @xmath8 . here , @xmath9 is the @xmath10-point @xmath1 phonon frequency .",
    "the fermi level @xmath11 in the emitter is such that the excited level is above it . with a further increase in @xmath8 , the levels in the well",
    "are lowered relative to @xmath12 .",
    "when the ground state comes under the bottom of the conduction band , the current is almost suppressed until the level @xmath5 reaches @xmath12 . to continue increasing @xmath8 ,",
    "the current begins to flow through the excited level , but since @xmath13 remains less than @xmath7 , the phonon emission is inhibited . for a given bias @xmath8 the resonant condition @xmath14 is achieved and the electrons begin to decay to the ground state by emitting primary@xmath15 phonons . the potential profile and the level positions at this resonant condition",
    "are shown in figure [ profile - fig1 ] .",
    "for an @xmath16 concentration greater than @xmath17 @xcite or @xmath18 @xcite , these phonons are confined inside the well ( they can be also absorbed by exciting electrons from @xmath6 to @xmath5 ) .",
    "the process described above , acts in parallel with the decay of primary @xmath1 phonons due to anharmonicity .",
    "one product of this decay is a secondary longitudinal optical phonon ( @xmath2 ) , the other is a transversal acoustic ( @xmath3 ) phonon @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 pair is produced by stimulated emission .",
    "therefore these @xmath3 phonons , for a bias greater than the operation threshold , are coherent and form a beam that we call saser by analogy with a laser .",
    "the coherence of the device presented here was studied previously @xcite by developing a formalism similar to that employed usually to study the coherence in lasers @xcite which take into account the competition among the several emitted modes .    in the early 60 s @xcite , generation of coherent phonons",
    "was discussed theoretically and observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "several experiments and applications were suggested @xcite .",
    "these phonons can be generated by intense pulses of laser @xcite .",
    "more details were described in the review of kurz @xcite . in a recent review , merlin @xcite discusses the generation of pulses of coherent @xmath20 optical phonons by intense femtosecond - pulsed lasers .",
    "coherent acoustic phonons can be also obtained with a wavelength given by the period of the superlattice where phonons are optically generated ( i.e. , @xmath21 _  _ ) @xcite . in our case ,",
    "the system generates coherent sound by electronic means with much shorter wavelength .",
    "the generation of high - frequency monochromatic acoustic waves by laser - induced thermomodulation was reported by damen @xcite .",
    "the phonon frequency ranged from @xmath22 to @xmath23 comparing with @xmath24 for our device .",
    "generation of phonons by stimulated emission was theoretically considered @xcite and observed experimentally .",
    "bron and grill @xcite reported the direct observation of the stimulated emission of @xmath25 phonons in a three level system of @xmath26 ions in @xmath27 .",
    "@xcite studied the phonon emission in a two level system of a glass .",
    "these phonons had a wide frequency distribution around @xmath28 .",
    "zavtrak and collaborators @xcite proposed a device consisting in a dielectric liquid with small particles or gas bubbles working in such a way similar to a free - electron laser",
    ". that device could produce coherent acoustic phonons by stimulated emission at a frequency @xmath29 .",
    "stimulated emission of phonons in an acoustic cavity was obtained experimentally by fokker _",
    "they use the metastable zeeman - split doublet in ruby .",
    "these phonons have frequencies of about @xmath30 .",
    "at present , several kinds of amplified coherent beams of bosons are produced by stimulated emission .",
    "besides the traditional visible or near infrared photons ( lasers ) and microwave photons ( masers ) , other coherent photon beams are produced .",
    "high energy lasing processes like x ray lasers ( called also xasers ) @xcite and gamma ray lasers ( grasers ) @xcite were studied .",
    "a very exciting field has been recently opened with the development of atoms lasers @xcite .",
    "several applications of these novel devices , like high precision gravimetry , are proposed .",
    "strongly related , it is the study of vibrational amplification by stimulated emission of radiation ( vaser ) @xcite .",
    "kleppner @xcite claims against that complicated jargon of acronyms and proposes to simplify to atom laser , x ray laser , etc .    in summary",
    ", a great effort has been made to produce terahertz phonons using other mechanisms different of stimulated emission .",
    "on the other side , acoustic phonons have been produced by stimulated emission but at frequencies lower than @xmath24 .",
    "the dbh resonator proposed here could produce a continuous beam of terahertz coherent phonons .",
    "the ultra short wavelength of these phonons permits potential applications .",
    "acoustic imaging is a very well known procedure , mainly in medicine , where it is exploited the fact that different water contents on several tissues produce different attenuations for a signal of about @xmath31 . today",
    "are available commercial equipments that can produce three - dimensional images of very high resolution .",
    "equipments for acoustic microscopy are less known but they are also commercially available .",
    "the most used technique is scanning acoustic microscopy ( sam ) @xcite that can attain resolutions higher than @xmath32 , taken with phonons of @xmath33 .",
    "besides the scanning acoustic microscopy , several techniques have been presented in a recent review @xcite : photoacoustic microscopy ( pam ) , scanning electron acoustic microscopy ( seam ) and scanning laser acoustic microscopy ( slam ) .",
    "the theory of acoustic imaging was also reviewed , schematic diagrams of the different microscopes are presented and several industrial applications are discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "the equipments mentioned above work at up to @xmath34 , three orders of magnitude lower than the frequency of the phonon beam considered in the present paper . therefore , they have a limited theoretical resolution given by its wavelength that is @xmath35 times greater than the generated by a dbh device .    to make the acoustic nanoscopy possible , it is necessary to have a coherent beam of ultra short wavelength phonons . to obtain images of a small structure",
    ", one would need waves shorter than the size of the details of the system .",
    "h. maris @xcite describes the process of acoustic nanoscopy by mean of echoes of ultra - short phonon pulses optically generated .",
    "they are detected by measuring the variation of optical reflectivity due to the scattered phonon pulses .",
    "they work with coherent phonons of about @xmath24 like those produced by our device , but they were not produced by a phonon laser .",
    "evidently , a laser is not necessary to produce optical images .",
    "nevertheless , lasers are a very useful tool for imaging and up today they are indispensable to make holograms . on the other hand , many optical experiments that can be made with incoherent light are done more easily and more precisely with the aid of a laser . therefore many experiments that are made today with incoherent phonons could be done better with the aid of a phonon laser .",
    "the phonon laser described in this paper has the wavelength smaller than @xmath36 _  _",
    "( what is about 20 times less than for the device described in @xcite )",
    ". therefore , it is possible to use it to see structures of about @xmath37 .",
    "a coherent source of x rays of about @xmath38 begins to be available now @xcite .",
    "even if it will be possible to make images of structures at the submicron scale by using x rays of a wavelength of about @xmath36 _  _ , they would have energies of about @xmath39 , what could affect the system to be studied .",
    "the device presented here could be used to get a hologram at nano - scale . to do this",
    ", it is possible to build in a _ gaas _ an acoustic analogous of a michelson interferometer .",
    "it consists of a thin barrier of _ algaas _ designed as a semimirror , placed at @xmath40 to split the beam and to force it to pass one half through the part of the sample we are interested in and the other across a very pure reference _",
    "gaas_. after that , we can use mirrors ( made of thick _ algaas _ barriers ) to superpose them and record the interference pattern with a detector .",
    "this pattern could be processed in a computer to get a hologram of the sample showing the three - dimensional shape of the nanostructure . in a previous paper @xcite we described , as an alternative , the acoustic version of a sagnac interferometer .",
    "because of the high sensitivity to all types of lattice defects , the phonon beam could be used to give information about the inner lattice structure @xcite , @xcite and form part of a phonon imaging setup as a source @xcite .",
    "we will show that the amplitude of the phonon beam is with a great precision directly proportional to the incoming current .",
    "therefore , the saser amplitude could be modulated by modulating the amplitude of the current .",
    "this will permit the use of the phonon laser as an information carrier between circuit components at very short distances .",
    "these `` phonoelectronic '' devices could work at smaller distances and lower energies than optoelectronic devices .",
    "if we achieve to make a `` phonoresist '' , i.e. , a material with a soft mode close to the frequency of our phonon laser , the saser could be used for nanolithography . due to the short wavelength and low energy of the phonon beam , `` phonolithography ''",
    "would be a better option than the methods currently in used .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follow .",
    "the hamiltonian which describes our system is presented in sec .",
    "the solutions of the hamiltonian are obtained is sec .",
    "iii . in the sec .",
    "iv , we show the procedure used to obtain the kinetic equations . we devote sec .",
    "v to present our results and conclusions .",
    "to describe our system , we considered a hamiltonian composed by a single particle part and one representing the interactions .",
    "the single particle part can be written as    @xmath41    where @xmath42 describes the electrons , and @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 phonons respectively .    assuming the grown direction as the @xmath46 axis , the hamiltonians @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 for the phonons can be written    @xmath50    @xmath51    @xmath52    where @xmath7 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 are the energies for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 phonons respectively and @xmath55(@xmath56 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for phonons with momentum @xmath57 perpendicular to the @xmath46 direction .",
    "two imaginary terms @xmath58 were introduced to take into account the decay by anharmonicity of the @xmath2 phonons and the escape of the @xmath3 phonons , respectively .    to describe the electrons",
    ", we use a tight binding approach with hoppings @xmath59 between nearest neighbors . writing the hamiltonian in a wannier basis , in terms of the electronic creation ( annihilation ) operators @xmath60(@xmath61 ) at site @xmath62 , we get    @xmath63    where @xmath64 with @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 .",
    "as the system has not magnetic behavior the subscript @xmath70 ( for spin ) is left implicit .",
    "our system has translational symmetry in the perpendicular directions ( @xmath71 )",
    ". therefore the hamiltonian can be uncoupled by expanding the operators @xmath72 in plane waves in these directions    @xmath73    we can treat the system as a sum over 1d hamiltonians for each wave vector @xmath74 perpendicular to the current @xmath75 direction    @xmath76    where @xmath77 .",
    "the energies @xmath78 are measured from the bottom of the conduction band of the emitter and @xmath79 .",
    "the energies @xmath80 are chosen to describe the energy profile of the dbh .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we will leave implicit the dependence on @xmath81 .    for the @xmath46 direction , we separate the space in three regions : the dispersion region and two semi - infinite one - dimensional chains . on the left",
    "we will have planes with energy @xmath82 for @xmath83 and to the right @xmath84 for @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the length of the dbh .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates of these two regions are planes waves . if we disconnect the dbh from the left and right chains we get for the dispersion region the profile of an infinite ( even not rectangular ) well as it is shown in figure [ well - fig2 ] .    for the dispersion region ,",
    "we diagonalize a three - diagonal matrix of order @xmath87 corresponding to the profile showed above getting the eigenvalues @xmath88 and the eigenvectors @xmath89 of equation    @xmath90    here , @xmath91 is the part of @xmath92 that goes from the beginning of the left barrier to the end of the right one . written in the basis of planes this is    @xmath93    where @xmath94 .",
    "after the diagonalization we get @xmath86 discrete levels .",
    "we label these levels through the index @xmath95 as @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 . for the right chain we rename the planes , from @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 to @xmath102 , @xmath22 , @xmath103 ; and for the left one , from @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106,@xmath101 , @xmath107 to @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath101 , @xmath110 .",
    "therefore we get a new picture where we have two semi - infinite chains , the first one corresponding to the planes @xmath111 , @xmath101 , @xmath112 and the other one corresponding to @xmath113 , @xmath101 , @xmath114 . among the @xmath86 levels obtained from the diagonalization of the matrix ( [ matrix ] ) ,",
    "only the two states with lowest energies will participate significantly in the electronic transport .",
    "the others are far over the fermi level and their effects will be considered later .    to connect the dbh with the left and right chains we compute the matrix elements    @xmath115",
    "the electronic hamiltonian is    @xmath116    a diagram representing the electronic hamiltonian ( [ h_e ] ) is shown in figure [ diagram_he ] .",
    "as it is well known @xcite , the dominant dispersion process in polar semiconductors is due to the coupling between electrons and @xmath1 phonons .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath117 has three terms    @xmath118    where @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 describe the electron - electron , the electron - phonon , and the phonon - phonon interactions respectively .",
    "@xmath119 is taken in the hartree approximation .",
    "that means that the energies @xmath122 of the levels in the well depend on the accumulated charge .",
    "the electron - phonon interaction hamiltonian has the form ,    @xmath123    in order to recover the translational symmetry in the @xmath71 plane we take the average on @xmath124 @xcite    @xmath125    where @xmath126 measure the effective strength of the interaction and was calculated as in @xcite .",
    "the phonon - phonon interaction is given by @xcite    @xmath127    this hamiltonian describes the decay @xmath128 and its inverse process ( recombination ) .",
    "as in the _ gaas _ the @xmath3 phonons are emitted fundamentally in the [ @xmath129 direction @xcite , we considered here a device that was grown in this direction .",
    "the inside barrier walls act as mirrors of a fabry - perot interferometer selecting discrete cavity modes .",
    "this mirrors also serve for a selection of the saser modes : those running in the grown direction are reflected several times between the mirrors and stay longer in the well , while all others are lost .    with the increasing of the applied bias @xmath8 , from a certain value , called saser threshold ,",
    "the @xmath3 phonons associated with the cavity resonant mode , i.e. , @xmath130 , stimulate strongly the @xmath1 phonon decay and their number grow sharply .",
    "once this mode is sufficiently populated , the probability of stimulated emission for that mode exceeds the sum of the emission probabilities for all other modes .",
    "thus , the @xmath3 phonons emitted in this mode will slave the other ones , giving rise to a coherent acoustic phonon beam .",
    "this process is similar to what happens in a laser . due to the momentum conservation @xmath131 and because of @xmath132 @xcite",
    "we get @xmath133 .",
    "the parameter @xmath134 appearing in ( [ h_ph - ph ] ) represents the intensity of the interaction and was estimated from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    finally , the total hamiltonian is the sum of both terms : the single particle and the interaction parts    @xmath135    where we had made the approximation that the momentum @xmath124 ( appearing in expressions ( [ h_lo ] ) , ( [ h_lo2 ] ) and ( [ h_ph - ph ] ) ) varies in the same range as @xmath81 .",
    "we can see at expression ( [ h ] ) that the hamiltonian became , in this approximation , fully uncoupled for each @xmath81 .",
    "this simplifies strongly the obtention of its solutions .",
    "in order to solve de hamiltonian described in the former section we introduce the operators    @xmath136    the operators @xmath137 creates the eigenstates of @xmath138 ( without the hopping terms )    @xmath139    formed by an electron at plane @xmath140 and @xmath141 @xmath1 phonons , @xmath142 @xmath143 phonons with parallel momentum @xmath81 ; and @xmath144 @xmath3 phonons .",
    "as it was done before , we will leave implicit the dependence on @xmath81 .    using the operators ( [ o ] ) and the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) we can calculate their equations of motion . in order to simplify the notation we call @xmath145 for the set of @xmath146 phonons    @xmath147 .",

    "@xmath158    the amplitudes @xmath159 are time dependent .",
    "we transform them    @xmath160    by doing that , we get the following set of equations    [ 1amplitudes ] @xmath161    here @xmath162 is the fourier transform of @xmath163 .    in order to obtain the solutions of ( [ 1amplitudes ] ) , we considered only three channels through which the electrons can tunnel .",
    "such channels are the only that are between the bottom of the conduction band ( @xmath164 ) and the fermi energy @xmath12 at the emitter , near the resonant condition .",
    "therefore , they are the only ones that contribute significantly to the current .",
    "these channels are : one electron through the excited level and no phonons ( channel @xmath104 , i.e. , @xmath165 ) ; one electron through the ground level and one @xmath1 phonon ( channel @xmath166 ) and one electron through the ground level and a pair @xmath19 phonons respectively ( channel @xmath167 ) .    to solve the system above ,",
    "we drop the imaginary part of @xmath168 .",
    "this cope with the problems caused by the non - hermitian hamiltonian .",
    "we have to note that the amplitudes @xmath169 ( for @xmath170 or @xmath171 ) remain uncoupled ( this tunneling channel does not mix with any other ) . on the other hand , the other two channels",
    "are coupled due to the ph - ph interaction .",
    "to uncouple them we propose the following transformation for the amplitudes    @xmath172    making the above transformations for the amplitudes @xmath173 and @xmath174 we get two new uncoupled channels ( called channels @xmath175 and @xmath176 ) .    considering only the channels @xmath104 and @xmath177 , the system ( [ 1amplitudes ] )",

    "the value of @xmath251 was taken equal to @xmath252 and was calculated from the experimental value of @xmath253 using @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the transmittance through the dbh is calculated from    @xmath254    a plot of the transmittance as a function of energy is shown in figure [ transmit - fig5 ] .",
    "it can be seen that when the ph - ph interaction is considered ( taking @xmath255 ) , a central peak appears .",
    "the other two peaks correspond to the polaronic branches already shown in previous works @xcite , @xcite .",
    "once the transmission probabilities through each channel are obtained , the output electronic current ( equal to the input current at the stationary regime ) through the structure can be calculated by summing over the occupied states at the emitter .",
    "this sum can be easily transformed into the integral    @xmath256    where @xmath257 is the device area , @xmath258 is the effective electron mass , @xmath259 is the reflectance and    @xmath260    instead of using the expression ( [ g ] ) to calculate the electronic current @xmath228 , it is calculated from the sum of the terms ( [ ig0  ] ) and ( [ ig0 ] ) .",
    "the difference between the currents calculated for @xmath255 and @xmath261 is appreciable only in the dashed region of figure [ current - fig6 ] , that it is amplified in the inset .    finally , the saser intensity and the @xmath3 phonon population are shown in figure [ saser - fig7 ] .",
    "this curve is obtained by solving the kinetic equations ( [ kin_equations ] ) .    in conclusion",
    "it was obtained here a set of kinetic equations using a full quantum treatment .",
    "this set is different from those presented in a previous work @xcite where the kinetic equations were derived phenomenologically . besides",
    ", we consider for the first time all the relevant phonons and its interactions in the calculation of the current .",
    "it was shown that when the phonon - phonon interaction is considered , only small modifications are observed for the current .    the accurate full quantum calculations for a dbh phonon laser confirm the results obtained using rougher phenomenological methods @xcite .",
    "one of us ( ic ) wants to acknowledge latin american agency claf for financial support .",
    "the channel @xmath263 is the only one that contribute significantly to the sum appearing in ( [ appendix-01 ] ) ( see fig .",
    "[ diagram_he ] and fig .",
    "[ diag1-fig3 ] ) . taking this into account , the expression ( [ appendix-01 ] ) can be rewriten as          to obtain an expression for the amplitude @xmath266 , we use ( [ a1_0 ] ) and neglect the term containing the renormalized hopping @xmath267 in it . taken into account the dispersion relation ( [ disp_k000 ] ) ,",
    "( [ e3 ] ) and using ( [ at000 ] ) to calculate the amplitude in the plane @xmath268 , we get              the term @xmath272 inside the integral varies very slowly in the range where the amplitude @xmath273 is not null . therefore",
    ", we can take it out of the integral .",
    "now , performing the integral over @xmath274 and taking the imaginary part we get                      writing @xmath282 in the first term of ( [ appendix-8 ] ) in terms of its fourier transform @xmath283 , doing the same with @xmath284 in the second term and using equations ( [ 1a0 ] ) , ( [ 1am0 ] ) ( only the terms that contain the factor @xmath285 ) we get                          the amplitudes @xmath292 and @xmath293 are the only ones that contribute significantly to the first and second sum , respectively . taking this into account and the fact that close to the resonance ( @xmath294 @xmath7 ) @xmath295 , equation ( [ appendix-12 ] ) can be written as        @xmath297 \\equiv r_{w }   \\label{appendix-14 } \\\\ & & \\text{where } w=\\sum_{occ}\\frac{g^{2}}{\\hbar \\delta } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\overline{n_{0}}\\equiv \\sum_{occ}\\left| p_{0}^{100}\\right| ^{2}\\text { and } % \\overline{n_{1^{\\prime } } } \\equiv \\sum_{occ}\\left| p_{1^{\\prime } } ^{0}\\right| ^{2}.   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      in summary , to obtain the kinetic equations similar to that used in @xcite , i.e. , involving only populations , we did not take into account the crossed terms .",
    "for example , if we consider the term with @xmath298 in ( [ 1a0 ] ) to obtain ( [ appendix-9 ] ) , then the expression for the amplitude @xmath299 would have a term depending on @xmath298 .",
    "that term would describe a virtual process . in this process , an electron tunnel through the left barrier ( @xmath300 ) directly to the ground state ( @xmath301 ) emitting one @xmath1 phonon .",
    "even when this process could occur , its probability is much smaller than that of the indirect process : first tunnel to the excited level , and then decay to the ground state emitting a @xmath1 phonon .",
    "therefore , we make the sum of each process as being independent .",
    "the results obtained from equations ( [ kin_equations ] ) are quite similar to those obtained from ( [ kin_eq ] ) .",
