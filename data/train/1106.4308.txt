    "the epoch between @xmath12 and @xmath10 appears to be crucial for the assembly of massive galaxies , as many authors find that the number density of galaxies with masses around 10@xmath13 and larger evolves very rapidly over this period of time ( fontana  et  al .  2006 ;",
    "marchesini  et  al .  2009 ; ilbert  et  al .",
    "2010 ; conselice  et  al .",
    "2011 ) . by redshift @xmath10 , however , the number density of early - types is comparable to the local one , with an increase of a factor of 1.5 allowed at the most ( cimatti  et  al .",
    "2006 ; franceschini  et  al .  2006",
    "; borch  et  al .",
    "there is also evidence that a substantial fraction of the massive elliptical galaxies at @xmath14 are smaller than their local counterparts of the same mass ( daddi  et  al .",

    "2011a in prep . ) .",
    "we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the formation of passively evolving galaxies and of their evolution in size and spatial abundance from @xmath16 to the present , including the physical mechanisms responsible for the quenching of star formation .",
    "classically , hierarchical models of galaxy formation predict that the evolution of massive galaxies at early epochs is mostly driven by major mergers ( e.g. shankar  et  al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) and that some form of feedback , from star formation itself or from agn activity , quenches star formation ( e.g. somerville  et  al  2008 ) . but highly turbulent disks with sfr @xmath17 have been claimed to also be efficient into slowing accreting gas in recent works ( frster - schreiber  et  al .  2006 ; frster - schreiber  et  al .  2009 ; genzel  et  al .",
    "others have suggested that at later epochs ( @xmath9 ) , the evolution is dominated by less violent processes , like minor mergers and/or smooth accretion ( van  dokkum  et  al .",
    "2010 ) , that can possibly explain the size evolution as well ( hopkins  et  al .",
    "recently , peng et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) have shown that two independent processes are responsible for the quenching , one related to mass ( or almost equivalently to the star formation rate ) , and another to the environment via the local overdensity , with the former dominating especially at high masses and early cosmic times , whereas the latter dominates at low masses and late times .",
    "observationally , there is still ongoing debate on the quantitative and qualitative features of the evolution of early - type galaxies .",
    "for example , the detection of compact size , and thus large stellar density , is mostly based on morphological studies done either using _",
    "hst_/acs @xmath18-band images , which at @xmath19 sample the rest - frame uv and thus might not reflect the morphology of the bulk of the stellar mass ( daddi  et  al .  2005",
    "; trujillo  et  al .  2007 ; cimatti  et  al .",
    "2008 ) ; or on _ hst_/nicmos or ground  based near - ir images , which have substantially worse resolution and/or image quality than acs , and thus are potentially affected by systematic errors ( toft  et  al .  2007 ;",
    "zirm  et  al .",
    "2007 ; van  dokkum  et  al .  2008",
    "; buitrago  et  al .",
    "even when taking advantage of modern , high - quality near  ir imagers such as _ hst_/wfc3 , only quite small samples have been studied so far ( cassata  et  al .",
    "2010 ; szomoru  et  al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "one essential step to map the evolution of passively evolving galaxies is the measure of the distribution function of their size at various cosmic epochs .",
    "while such distribution function has been studied in the local universe , at @xmath20 the measures remain uncertain .",
    "there is evidence that the size of high - redshift early - type galaxies ( etg ) covers a range that overlaps with those in the present - day universe ( e.g. saracco et  al . 2010 ) , whereas selection effects might contribute to underestimate the contribution by more extended galaxies in the high - z samples ( mancini et  al . 2010 ) . in any case , the mass - size relation of passively evolving galaxies and its evolution with redshift still remains poorly constrained . even at @xmath1 , the distribution function of the effective radius of early - type galaxies is not well characterized at the small end , with some groups suggesting that a compact population of early - types could be hidden among unresolved red objects ( shih  &  stockton  ( 2011 ) .",
    "moreover , valentinuzzi  et  al .",
    "( 2010a ; 2010b ) reported evidence of a rich population of compact passive galaxies at @xmath21 and @xmath22 , and saracco  et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) pointed out that the number density of @xmath0 compact galaxies is comparable with the local density of similarly small early - types .",
    "recently , various groups have analyzed the morphology of massive early - type galaxies at @xmath20 using wfc3 images in the hudf and/or ers field ( both located within the boundaries of goods - south ) and found that the size of passive galaxies at @xmath0 is almost independent of the wavelength , confirming previous results on the compactness of such galaxies ( e.g. , cassata et  al . 2010 ; ryan  et  al .",
    "2011 ; szomoru et  al .",
    "if indeed the rest - frame uv morphology of these galaxies is similar to that at optical wavelength this allows us to use the wider acs database for statistically significant studies of the distribution function of their effective radius , its dependence with the stellar mass , and its evolution with redshift .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compare the size distribution _ in the same rest - frame optical _ for homogeneous samples of early - type galaxies at @xmath4 , selected in a consistent way , and to constrain the number evolution of normal and compact early - types over the same epoch . in particular , we exploit the goods multi - band dataset to build a robust sample of passive early - type galaxies at @xmath23 , and a similar sample of galaxies at @xmath24 .",
    "we complement those two with a sample of local early - type galaxies from the sdss survey , selected using the same criteria . using the sdss sample , we establish the local mass - size relation , and we identify local compact etgs .",

    "we show the region of the plane where our selection detects at least 80% of the objects . to build this region we took the reddest template available in our sample , for which we know , at every redshift , the @xmath43band magnitude as a function of the stellar mass ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .",

    "finally , we built , at each redshift bin , the locus of the 80% completeness limit in the stellar mass vs @xmath69 plane .",
    "the detection fraction at smaller masses or larger sizes of this model drops really quickly : in practice , objects left of this line can not be detected by our selection method ( the few objects lying out of the forbidden region are bluer than the extreme template we used for this exercise ) ; on the other hand , this work ensures that we detect at least 80% of the objects lying to the right of the line . at @xmath32 ,",

    "the first interesting result is that at @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively about 65% , 95% and 100% of early - type galaxies are more than @xmath25 below the local relation , and that about 25% , 50% and 80% are ultracompact , according to our definition .",
    "the evolution of these fractions between @xmath23 seems to be real : in fact , even considering only the part of the plane where the detection is higher than 80% , the result still holds . in particular , at @xmath109 , we should detect `` normal '' etg with @xmath110 kpc at @xmath40 , if they were present , but we detect none .",
    "however , since at @xmath40 we might progressively miss more and more large galaxies , it is possible that the compact and ultra - compact fractions at those redshifts are slightly over - estimated . in the following sections and figures , in order to improve the statistics , we will combine the three redshift bins of figure  [ fig4 ] in one .",
    "note that the absence in our sample of very massive galaxies with large size is due to their rarity , as with a surface density of one every @xmath111 arcmin@xmath41 ( mancini  et  al .  2010 ) one does not expect to find any in the 40 arcmin@xmath41 covered by the wfc3 data .    at @xmath23 , passive galaxies appear to be on average 35 times smaller than local counterparts of the same mass .",

    "in particular , we built 1000 realizations of our sample by perturbing the stellar mass of each galaxy assuming a typical ( quite conservative ) random error of @xmath860.4 dex , and we thus measured 1000 realizations of the mass density as a function of the redshift . in figs .",

    "in fact , the sizes and srsic indices measured in the uv and optical rest - frame correlate quite well with each other , with the sizes measured in the optical rest - frame being slightly smaller ( by @xmath520% and @xmath510% at @xmath163 and @xmath164 , respectively ) than those derived from the uv rest - frame .",
    "this shows that , at least for galaxies that are not currently forming stars , the morphological k - correction is weak , and thus that acs/@xmath43band observations , if deep enough , can be indeed used to measure the size of passive galaxies at @xmath8 .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous results by trujillo  et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) and cassata  et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) and , at lower redshift , with cassata  et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) and papovich  et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "we showed that the mass - size relation of etgs evolves significantly from 1.6 to @xmath1 : @xmath165 of etgs at @xmath159 in our sample are smaller than local counterparts of the same mass , and at later epochs etgs are increasingly larger .",
    "we showed as well that the fractional increase of the average size is almost independent on the stellar mass .    with the aim of understanding whether the evolution of the mass - size relation is driven by the size growth of each individual galaxy or by the appearance of new large etgs ,",
    "we have built the size distribution in four redshift bins , scaled to the number density of etgs in each bin .",
    "we observed that etgs at @xmath23 are on average 0.5 dex smaller than local counterparts of the same mass , and we identified a rich population of _ ultra - compact _ etgs that have no identified counterparts in terms of size and density in the local universe . as the time goes by , at @xmath91 the number of etgs is increased by a factor of 5 , and the new etgs have a broad range of sizes , from 0.5 dex smaller to 0.5 dex larger than local counterparts of the same mass . at @xmath166",
    "the evolution is milder , with the number of etgs increasing of another factor of 1.5 down to @xmath1 ; the sizes of the new etgs formed in this phase are similar to the average local value ; at the same time the small etgs gradually disappear , growing in size and skewing the size distribution towards large sizes .",
    "these results show that both the mechanisms driving the evolution of the mass - size relation are at work at the same time .",
    "we measured the mass and number density of early - type galaxies as a function of redshift , including the evolution of the relative fraction of _ normal _ , _ compact _ and _ ultracompact _ ones .",
    "more in details , we showed that the number and mass density of massive and passive early - types increase by a factor of @xmath167 within the @xmath168 gyr between @xmath159 to @xmath10 , in agreement with arnouts  et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) and ilbert  et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) . in the following 4 gyr , from @xmath10 to @xmath160 , the number density increases by at most another factor of @xmath169 , while in the same interval the mass density remains constant .",
    "this implies that , as expected in a `` downsizing '' scenario , the added galaxies that drive the number evolution have small masses and do not contribute too much to the mass density .",
    "these findings are in good agreement with franceschini  et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) , borch  et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) and abraham  et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and similar to the results by cimatti ,  daddi  &  renzini  ( 2006 ) and scarlata  et  al .",
    "( 2007 ) .    from @xmath10 to @xmath1",
    ", we showed also that the number ( and mass ) density of _ compact _ early - types decreases by a factor of 2 , while the number density of normal - size etgs increases much faster , indicating once again that the overall increase of the average size at fixed mass is only partly due to a size increase of individual galaxies , whereas part of the effect is due to the appearance of new etgs with large size .",
    "we interpret these results as the evidence that the phases at @xmath8 and @xmath9 are dominated by distinct and different physical mechanisms .",
    "the scenario that comes out is the following : the epoch at @xmath11 is when the bulk of the stellar mass in local early - type galaxies is assembled .",
    "this process of assembly is quite rapid : the stellar mass locked in passive early - type galaxies increases by a factor of 5 over a period of @xmath52 gyr . whatever the mechanism responsible for this huge mass density increase ( gas - rich major merger , collapse of unstable disks , monolithic collapse ) , it produces a remnant that is compact and small with respect to local counterparts : @xmath580% of early - types in this redshift interval are smaller than galaxies of the same mass in the local universe .",
    "interestingly , targett  et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) found that submillimeter galaxies at @xmath0 have similar sizes to those that we measure for etgs at the same epoch , suggesting a possible evolutionary connection between the two classes of galaxies . on the other hand",
    "the evolution at @xmath9 is much milder . in this phase ,",
    "the compact galaxies continuously increase in size , eventually disappearing , most likely undergoing a series of dry and wet minor mergers or by slowing accreting a small amount of mass in their outskirts ( e.g. van  dokkum  et  al .",
    "2010 ; hopkins  et  al .",
    "2009 ) . at the same time , new etgs are formed , driving the number density increase of a factor 1.5 that we observe from @xmath10 to @xmath1 .",
    "these new etgs have small masses and large sizes , indicating that the mechanism through which they are formed is different from the one that at @xmath8 generated the compact etgs .",
