    "electron - electron interactions are important in understanding the properties of many transition metal oxides.@xcite novel ordered phases are found in this class of compounds : e.g. , high-@xmath5 superconductors , @xmath6-electron heavy fermions , and quantum magnets . the inclusion of disorder into such materials , and into the models of such systems , adds another level of complexity . in this report",
    "we focus on metal - to - insulator transitions that are controlled by the combined effects of both interactions and disorder . in part , this work is part of an effort to understand several experimental results , including the properties of the weakly doped cuprates,@xcite for which disorder effects are known to be important .",
    "initially , we were motivated to conduct such theoretical work to better understand this transition in the material lial@xmath7ti@xmath8o@xmath9.@xcite the ordered and undoped material liti@xmath10o@xmath9 undergoes a transition to a superconducting phase@xcite around @xmath11 , and has been proposed to be related to the family of high-@xmath5 superconductors.@xcite if such a conjecture is correct , there must be reasonably large electron - electron interactions in this system .",
    "the al - doped system undergoes a metal - insulator transition for @xmath12 , and recent theoretical work by one of us and co - workers have suggested that ( i ) the effects of disorder alone can not lead to such a transition@xcite ; ( ii ) inclusion of electron - electron interactions in the form of an on - site hubbard energy can lead to such a transition.@xcite this occurs by the suppression of the density of states at the fermi energy to near zero .",
    "the results presented in this report are a natural continuation of such work .",
    "in addition , other systems display such transition .",
    "sarma et al.@xcite have investigated the electronic structure of lani@xmath13mn@xmath14o@xmath15 .",
    "it is known that for a critical concentration of @xmath16 a metal - to - insulator transition is found .",
    "the point - contact tunnelling conductance spectra , which provides information on the density of states , show a suppression at the fermi energy in the form of a downward cusp for both @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the conductance is found to be proportional to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the bias voltage .",
    "this behaviour was predicted by altshuler and aronov@xcite , and is similar to the results that we encountered in studies of lial@xmath7ti@xmath8o@xmath9.@xcite kim et al.@xcite have studied the transport and optical properties of srti@xmath13ru@xmath14o@xmath15 .",

    ", there are six types of electronic states .",
    "the metal - to - insulator transition takes place at @xmath26 . as @xmath21 decreases from one , the concentration of conduction electron decreases , and the effective interaction strength increases .",
    "these systems are very complicated , having several important @xmath6 orbitals for different conducting sites , and many different interaction , disorder and hopping energy parameters .",
    "the theoretical considered below are a minimalist s approach to such interesting behaviour .",
    "a simplified model that describes interacting electrons moving on a spatially disordered lattice is the so - called anderson - hubbard model .",
    "its hamiltonian is given by @xmath27 electron annihilation / creation operators for site @xmath28 and spin @xmath29 are represented by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the spatially inhomogeneous environment in which the electrons move is accounted for by on - site energies , @xmath32 , which are random .",
    "often , these are selected to be chosen from a uniform distribution , @xmath33 $ ] , and therefore @xmath34 is the energy scale characterizing the strength of the disorder .",
    "interactions between electrons are accounted for by the intra - site hubbard interaction term , characterized by the energy scale @xmath3 .",
    "the near - neighbour hopping frequency is denoted by @xmath35 , and all other symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "it is hoped that this model can capture some of the essential physics of the metal - insulator transitions@xcite of disordered transition - metal oxides .",
    "the electronic properties of systems described by this model hamiltonian are indeed complicated , as can be understood from the following reasons .",
    "when disorder is sufficiently strong it can lead to the localization of electrons , and favours large electronic occupancies on sites with low on - site energies .",
    "therefore , disorder generates both localization effects and an inhomogeneous distribution of electronic charge . there exists a critical disorder , @xmath36 , beyond which all states are localized and the system becomes an anderson insulator.@xcite in a spatially uniform half - filled system , electron - electron interactions also lead to the effective localization of electrons ; however , in contrast to disorder , interactions favour single occupancy of electrons on all sites . in general , at a critical interaction , @xmath37 , the system undergoes a transition from a metal to a mott insulator .",
    "however , the mott transition may not take place when the electronic concentration is away from half - filling .",
    "due to the randomness of the on - site energies , it is usual to address this model using numerical techniques .",
    "also , except for some small clusters that can be solved exactly , large lattices have to be solved with the help of approximate schemes .",
    "this difficulty notwithstanding , a small number of  exact \" numerical results are available , coming from both exact diagonalization ( ed)@xcite and monte carlo ( mc)@xcite studies . because of their relevance to our work , we mention one aspect of the results in two of these papers .",
    "that is , some ed calculations showed the presence of a suppression of the dos at the fermi energy , in both one@xcite and two@xcite dimensions .",
    "these results are consistent with the hf papers mentioned below .",
    "therefore , this provides partial verification of the results based on the hf method , the method used in the remainder of this paper .",
    "the hartree - fock ( hereafter hf ) method is well known , and its application to disordered systems is extensive .",
    "the accuracy of the results was recently critiqued by us and coworkers,@xcite where it was shown that provided one allowed for sufficient magnetic degrees of freedom the energies and charge densities of ( small ) exactly solvable systems agreed well with those obtained from hf .",
    "however , since the spin correlations are essentially those of pairs of classical spins of variable directions and lengths , and therefore do not include quantum fluctuations , hf is less successful at capturing the correct spin - spin correlations .    as mentioned , the hf approximation has been applied in many studies of the anderson - hubbard and related models .",
    "some examples are ( i ) a study of a two - dimensional point - defect model@xcite which represents the acceptors and donors in the high-@xmath5 cuprate la@xmath38sr@xmath14cuo@xmath9 through determining the magnetic phase diagram , ( ii ) a proposal of a novel inhomogeneous metallic phase in two dimensions@xcite as a combined effect of disorder and electronic interactions when their strengths are comparable , and ( iii ) a detailed study of the three - dimensional anderson - hubbard model , determining both magnetic and electric phase diagrams at half - filling.@xcite    in refs .",
    "@xcite , tusch and logan have focused on @xmath39-filling and some other fillings lower than @xmath40 . at @xmath39-filling with a disorder strength of @xmath41 ,",
    "the density of states ( hereafter denoted by dos ) shows a suppression for both @xmath42 and @xmath43 . using the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) technique , the system is determined to be metallic at @xmath42 and insulating at @xmath44 .",
    "the ipr is compared with a threshold mean ipr ( obtained in the noninteracting limit ) that scales with system size to determine whether the system is metallic or insulating .",
    "however , the effect of the interactions on the threshold mean ipr is unknown , as are the effects the unusual statistical distribution of the ipr , the latter having been discussed by mirlin.@xcite in part to circumvent such problems , here we focus on the characterization of the metallicity of a system via its optical conductivity .    in the hf treatment of lial@xmath7ti@xmath8o@xmath9 by one of us and coworkers,@xcite a metal - to - insulator transition , again found from an examination of the behaviour of the ipr , was found . in that work",
    "the local magnetic moments were restricted to lie along the @xmath45-axis , geometrically frustrated corner - sharing tetrahedral lattices were studied , and a quantum site percolation model of disorder was used .",
    "open questions concern whether the suppression of the dos at the fermi level depends on the lattice type and the disorder model . to answer these questions",
    ", we choose to study three - dimensional simple cubic lattices , which are unfrustrated , and consider a uniform box distribution type of disorder .",
    "we also allow local magnetic moments to develop in the @xmath46-plane , which increases the spin degree of freedom , believed to be important in some circumstances.@xcite    we also mention the effective - field theory analysis of local moment formation in disordered interacting fermi liquids by milovanovic , sachdev , and bhatt.@xcite the potential importance of such moments in the metal - insulator transition was left as an outstanding question , and will be one of the main aspects addressed in this paper .      in this paper , we apply the real - space self - consistent hf method to electrons moving on simple cubic lattices at @xmath47-filling , with various strengths of interaction and disorder . here",
    "we report our results from calculations of the dos and ac conductivity .    when examining systems with a disorder strength of @xmath48 , we find that the dos and the low - frequency conductivity are enhanced by a weak interaction ( @xmath49 ) , and for this range of interactions there are no magnetic moments in the system , and the ac conductivity is drude - like . with a stronger interaction ( @xmath50 ) , a suppression of the dos at the fermi level and",
    "qualitative changes ( non - drude - like ) in the low - frequency conductivity are found .",
    "we find that concomitant with these changes in behaviour is the appearance of local magnetic moments in the system , although no evidence of magnetic ordering is present .",
    "for this disorder strength and electron concentration a metal - to - insulator transition is likely to take place at a critical @xmath51 ; that is , roughly 3/4 of the noninteracting bandwidth .",
    "we have also examined the weaker disorder strength of @xmath52 , and although one finds a small suppression of the dos with increasing hubbard interaction , for no value of @xmath53 do we find a metal - to - insulator transition .",
    "for ordered systems , one may transform the hamiltonian to wave vector space , and then expand the many - particle wave function in a complete set of bloch wave functions in the corresponding periodic potential .",
    "however , in disordered systems there is no translational symmetry , and working in wave vector space does not simplify the problem .",
    "therefore , we will work in real space . in the real - space formulation of hf",
    "theory ( _ e.g. _ , see page 349 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) the disorder is treated exactly , and therefore this approximation allows for us to include in our calculations _ the effects of localization_. in the real - space formulation of hf theory the local hubbard interaction term is replaced by @xmath54 here , the terms that are proportional to fluctuations about the mean values squared are ignored .",
    "also , we do not consider the expectation values that arise from superconducting correlations .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ hubbardterm ] ) into the anderson - hubbard hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ andersonhubbardham ] ) , one finds the hf effective hamiltonian given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 @xmath57 here , @xmath58 is the expectation value of the number of electrons with spin @xmath59 on site @xmath60 ; @xmath61 is the spin dependent effective on - site energy at site @xmath60 , and it is the sum of the original on - site energy plus the hubbard @xmath3 times the number of electrons with the opposite spin on that site .",
    "therefore , in the absence of the last term one includes the effects of the hubbard interaction via an effective shift of the on - site energies .",
    "the last term in eq .",
    "( [ effham ] ) does include the @xmath62 effective local fields , and these guarantee that the effective hamiltonian is invariant under rotations in spin space . in the self - consistent formulation of hf",

    "( [ effham ] ) lead to local spin - resolved charge densities and effective local fields that satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ eq : eff1],[eq : eff2 ] ) when the expectation values are taken with respect to the hf ground state wave function .",
    "as mentioned above , one is required to solve the effective hamiltonian self - consistently . in a system with @xmath63 sites",
    ", one has @xmath64 variational parameters that have to be determined numerically so that the ground - state energy is minimized .",
    "( in addition , one includes a chemical potential to fix the electronic density at whatever concentration is desired . in our results below we focus on 1/4 filling . ) to solve the effective hamiltonian self - consistently , one begins with a random initial guess for the @xmath64 parameters that satisfies the constraint of fixing the total number of electrons , and then iterates to self consistency .",
    "one needs to repeat the above procedure with many other initial guesses of the variational parameters and below we examine the self - consistent states having the lowest energy hf energies , @xmath65 .",
    "after self - consistency is achieved for the hf solutions , we obtain effective single - electron energies , \\{@xmath66 } , and the dos is then given by @xmath67 in our results shown below , we broaden each delta function using a gaussian function given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is where @xmath70 takes maximum value , and @xmath6 is the standard deviation ( or the broadening width ) .    to calculate the ac conductivity , one first obtains the imaginary part of the current - current correlation function using the kubo formula : @xmath71 where @xmath72 then , the real part of the ac conductivity is@xcite @xmath73 to calculate the ac conductivity numerically , we broaden each delta function in eq .",
    "( [ i m a ] ) using a gaussian function given by eq .",
    "( [ gaussian_func ] ) . in our results",
    "below we state the broadening for each quantity .",
    "while the anderson - hubbard model is often used to study disordered electronic systems with strong electron - electron interactions , it is not always clear how the parameter space studied for such models relates to real materials , particularly with regards to the strength of the disorder potential .",
    "here we focus on the appropriate range of disorder strengths .    when characterizing the strength of the potential energy it is usual to compare @xmath3 to the noninteracting bandwidth for electrons moving on an ordered lattice .",
    "for a 3d simple cubic lattice that is @xmath74 .",
    "weak interactions correspond to @xmath75 , intermediate to @xmath76 , and strong to @xmath77 .",
    "this leads to the question , is it permissible to use the same characterization for the disorder strength ?",
    "we have examined the @xmath78 anderson model ( at 1/4 filling - the same as the electronic concentration studied throughout this paper ) using a box distribution disorder ",
    "all on - site energies between @xmath79 and @xmath80 are equally probable .",
    "we have then found the ac conductivity of this system for various @xmath81 , and here we discuss the results corresponding to @xmath82 and 6 .",
    "if one fits our conductivity data to the real conductivity of a drude model , the latter given by @xmath83 one obtains estimates of the relaxation time and the dc conductivity shown in table  [ table : drude ] .",
    "the difference between the @xmath84 extrapolations quantifying the dc conductivities are striking , in that for @xmath85 we find @xmath86 , whereas for @xmath48 we find @xmath87 , implying that the conductivity of these systems differs by almost a factor of 60 .",
    "clearly , the noninteracting @xmath48 ( or equivalently @xmath88 ) system corresponds to a  bad metal \" .",
    "( however , while the @xmath48 system is a very poor conductor , for this disorder strength we are not approaching a 1/4-filled anderson insulator , and , in fact , our calculations and existing data@xcite allow us to determine that @xmath89 , with @xmath90 being the location of the mobility edge . )",

    "the @xmath91 and @xmath92 are found from fits of the ac conductivity to eq .",
    "( [ eq : drude - real ] ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     further justification for this claims follows from a second way of characterizing the  strength \" of the disorder , and corresponds to evaluating the elastic mean free path , @xmath93 , in the born approximation .",
    "one finds@xcite @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the lattice constant and @xmath45 is the coordination number for a particular lattice .",
    "therefore , for @xmath85 ,  2 , and 6 one has @xmath96 , 13 , and 1.4 , respectively . while one does not expect the born approximation to be accurate quantitatively , especially when it predicts @xmath97 , from these results it follows that for noninteracting electrons moving on a three dimensional simple cubic lattice with @xmath88 one has a very short mean free path .",
    "so , while it might be conventional to refer to a @xmath98 correlated electronic systems as being intermediate coupling , for a disorder strength of @xmath88 the system remains metallic but the effect of the disorder potential is indeed very large .",
    "as we see in the results below , it is only for such large disorder strengths , which by itself leads to substantial localization effects , that we find a disorder+correlation - driven metal - insulator transition .",
    "( also , note that in our previous study of lithium titanate@xcite we employed a quantum site percolation model , which formally corresponds to setting all a site energies to be zero while those on the b sites are infinite - that is , the b sites are removed from the conduction path . with such a large disorder potential ( of infinite strength for a binary alloy model of disorder ) we did obtain a metal - insulator transition.@xcite )      as mentioned in the introduction , one of the motivations for this study was to better understand the conditions necessary for the appearance of a suppression in the dos at the fermi level .",
    "previous work@xcite was performed on a lattice appropriate for the description of lial@xmath99ti@xmath8o@xmath9 , namely on a corner - sharing tetrahedral lattice .",
    "also , that work was completed using a restricted hf theory : in terms of the above - presented formalism , the effective local fields @xmath100 were set to be zero , meaning that the spin degrees of freedom were restricted to develop along the quantization axis ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "all of our results here are for a 3d simple cubic lattice  unlike the corner - sharing tetrahedral lattice , this lattice is bipartite and therefore unfrustrated . in terms of the magnetic degrees of freedom , here we present results from our new hf calculations for two different situations .",

    "the nonparamagnetic hf result shows a strong suppression of the dos at the fermi level ; however , the paramagnetic hf result shows no suppression at all .    since we only found a suppression of the dos with nonparamagnetic hf solutions , both with @xmath107 ( in ref .",
    "@xcite ) and @xmath103 being real , the magnetic moments are essential to the suppression and to the metal - insulator transition ( at least within the hf context ) .",
    "the moments found for the real @xmath103 hf ground state are strongly noncollinear  _ e.g. _ , see our discussion in ref .",
    "therefore , the restriction of collinear moments employed in refs .",
    "@xcite is not important to the suppression .",

    "@xcite ) and for the unfrustrated simple cubic lattices studied in this paper . also , the type of disorder does not matter , since the suppression is found either with a quantum site percolation model ( in ref .",
    "@xcite ) or with a uniform box distribution type of disorder .    to better quantify the presence of the local moments we have calculated the average magnitude of the moment per electron .",
