    "the cp or t violation is a fundamental and important problem of the particle physics and cosmology .",
    "the cp study of the lepton sector , though it has been less examined than that of quark sector , is indispensable , since the neutrinos are allowed to have masses and complex mixing angles in the electroweak theory .    the neutrino oscillation search is a powerful experiment which can examine masses and mixing angles of the neutrinos .",
    "in fact the several underground experiments have shown lack of the solar neutrinos@xcite and anomaly in the atmospheric neutrinos@xcite , implying that there may occur the neutrino oscillation .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino anomaly suggests mass difference around @xmath0 ev@xmath1@xcite , which encourages us to make long base line neutrino experiments .",
    "recently such experiments are planned and will be operated in the near future@xcite .",
    "it seems necessary for us to examine whether there is a chance to observe not only the neutrino oscillation but also the cp or t violation by long base line experiments . in this short paper",
    "we study such possibilities taking account of the atmospheric neutrino experiments and also considering the solar neutrino experiments and others .",
    "we briefly review cp and t violation in vacuum oscillation@xcite to clarify our notation .",
    "let s denote the mass eigenstates of 3 generations of neutrinos by @xmath2 with mass eigenvalues in vacuum . ] @xmath3 and the weak eigenstates by @xmath4 corresponding to electron , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "they are connected by a unitary transformation :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is a unitary ( @xmath9 ) matrix similar to the ckm matrix for quarks .",
    "we will use the parametrisation for @xmath8 by chau and keung@xcite , @xmath10 where the @xmath11 s are the gell - mann matrices .",
    "the evolution equation for the weak eigenstate is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 s are the momenta , @xmath14 is the energy and @xmath15 .",
    "a term proportional to a unit matrix like @xmath16 in eq.[eq : evoleq ] is dropped because it is irrelevant to the transition probability .",
    "the solution for the equation is @xmath17    the transition probability of @xmath18 at distance @xmath19 is given by @xmath20    the t violation gives the difference between the transition probability of @xmath21 and that of @xmath22@xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24    the unitarity of @xmath8 gives @xmath25 with the sign @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) for @xmath28 in cyclic ( anti - cyclic ) order(@xmath26 for @xmath29 or @xmath30 ) . in the following",

    "the cpt theorem gives the relation between the transition probability of anti - neutrino and that of neutrino , @xmath39 which relates cp violation to t violation : @xmath40      let s consider how large the t(cp ) violation can be in the `` disparate '' mass difference case and the smaller one by @xmath41 in the case that the mass differences have a large ratio .",

    "because @xmath46 in this case , the oscillatory part @xmath34 becomes @xmath47 : @xmath48    fig.[fig1 ] shows the graph of @xmath49 .",
    "the approximation eq.[eq : fapp ] works very well up to @xmath50 . in the following",
    "we will use eq.[eq : fapp ] instead of eq.[eq : f ] .",
    "we see many peaks of @xmath51 in fig.[fig1 ] . in practice , however , we do not see such sharp peaks but observe the value averaged around there , for @xmath52 has a spread due to the energy spread of neutrino beam ( @xmath53 ) . in the following",
    "we will assume @xmath54@xcite as a typical value .",
    "table [ table1 ] gives values of @xmath55 at the first several peaks and the averaged values around there .",
    "we see the t violation effect , @xmath56 at peaks for neutrino beams with 20 % of energy spread .",
    "note that the averaged peak values decrease with the spread of neutrino energy .",
    "which peak we can reach depends on @xmath57 and @xmath14 .",
    "the first peak @xmath58 is reached , for example by @xmath59 ev@xmath1 , @xmath60 km ( for kek - kamiokande long base line experiment ) and neutrino energy @xmath61 gev . in this case",

    "@xmath68 .",
    "because @xmath69 and @xmath70 oscillate rapidly and vanish after being averaged over the energy spread in this case , the oscillatory part @xmath34 is dominated by @xmath71 .",
    "since @xmath34 has now a bound @xmath72 instead of eq.[eq : fmax ] , the t violation effect @xmath73 is bounded as @xmath74 .",
    "( for energy spread of @xmath75 of neutrino beam@xcite , @xmath76 is enough for @xmath69 and @xmath70 to oscillate rapidly and vanish after being averaged . )",
    "there are a variety of possible combinations of the parameters , three mixing angles , two mass differences and a cp violating phase .",
    "when we consider only the atmospheric neutrino anomaly to be attributed to the neutrino oscillation , we can take the mass differences , @xmath41 and @xmath77(and hence @xmath78 ) , to be comparable , while when we consider both the solar and the atmospheric neutrino anomalies to be attributed to the neutrino oscillation , we expect @xmath41 and @xmath77 to be `` disparate '' , @xmath79 .",
    "we investigate how large the cp violation effect can be in neutrino oscillation for the above two cases .",
    "let s examine the case of mass differences to be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we use a parameter set that @xmath80ev@xmath1 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 is arbitrary , derived by yasuda@xcite through the analysis of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly . here",
    "the matter effect@xcite is negligibly small and eq.[eq : cpt ] is available .    with use of eq.[eq : jf ] , eq.[eq : j ] , and eq.[eq : cpt ] this parameter set gives the cp violation effect @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85    ( 16,6 ) ( 135,38)@xmath86 ( 0,75)@xmath87    fig.[fig2 ] shows the oscillatory part @xmath88 .",
    "there are many peaks @xmath88 showing the possibility to observe the large cp violation effect .",
    "for example , we may see very large difference between the transition probabilities , @xmath89 @xmath90 for @xmath60 km(for kek - kamiokande experiment ) and @xmath914.5 gev corresponding to @xmath92 , if we have large @xmath93 .",
    "incidentally we may remark that the survival probability of solar neutrino is calculated to be 0.45 for those mixing angles .",
    "this value is consistent with both two gallium experiments@xcite and kamiokande experiment@xcite , but it is inconsistent with homestake result@xcite , if all the solar neutrino anomaly should be attributed to the neutrino oscillation@xcite .",
    "in conclusion we may see a large cp violation effect when we have comparable mass differences . in this respect",
    "we note that the long base line experiments are urgently desirable .",
    "next we consider the `` disparate '' mass difference case @xmath94 .    the case @xmath95 ev@xmath1 and @xmath96 ev@xmath1 is favoured by the hot dark matter scenario@xcite and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly .",
    "this case is already analysed by tanimoto@xcite and we will not discuss it here .",
    "the case @xmath97 ev@xmath1 and @xmath98 ev@xmath1 could typically explain the anomalies of the atmospheric and the solar neutrinos@xcite . in this case we can not neglect the matter effect@xcite @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the electron number density of the earth and @xmath101 is the matter density of the surface of the earth , since it is greater than @xmath41 .",
    "it requires to subtract such effect in order to deduce the pure cp violation effect@xcite . in principle",
    "it is possible , because the matter effect is proportional to @xmath14 while @xmath41 is constant .",
    "in the matter with constant density requires the exchange of the production point and the detection point and the time reversal of @xmath102 in matter is in general different from @xmath103@xcite . ]",
    ", we have a pure t violation effect @xmath104 , though we do not observe a pure cp violation effect because of an apparent cp violation due to matter .",

    "which is consistent with the analysis of the atmospheric neutrino anomalies , it is found that there is a possibility that the cp violation effect is large enough to be observed by 100 @xmath155 1000 km base line experiments if the cp violating parameter sin@xmath82 is sufficiently large .    in case that @xmath41 is much smaller than the matter parameter `` @xmath156 '' and @xmath77 , which is favoured both by the solar and atmospheric neutrino anomalies , we have derived a simple formula for the t violation effect .",
