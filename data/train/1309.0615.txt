    "a promising route towards the implementation of all - optical information processing or future quantum technologies is to combine different technologies into a hybrid system .",
    "this way , the different core functionalities can be realized using different methods , exploiting their individual advantages . but the various technologies typically operate at different characteristic frequencies , such that efficient frequency conversion is usually required . such frequency conversion can be accomplished using non - linear four - wave mixing processes  @xcite , which have already been widely studied and applied in various settings .",
    "example are conventional up- and down - frequency conversion to generate vacuum - ultraviolet ( vuv ) or extreme - ultraviolet ( xuv )  @xcite or far infrared ( ir )  @xcite light .",
    "but since fwm is a non - linear process , it sensitively depends on the intensities of the applied fields , and thereby on the propagation dynamics  @xcite and on the transverse intensity profile of the applied fields .",
    "it is well - known , however , that light beams propagating in free space rapidly spread , together with a distortion of the transverse beam profile due to diffraction .",
    "the origin for diffraction is that each momentum component of the propagating beam acquires a different phase shift throughout the propagation .",
    "diffraction is a fundamental limitation in particular for the creation , detection or propagation of small images , due to the large momentum bandwidth .",
    "the effect of diffraction thus is not only to destroy the information carried in the transverse beam profile , but also to distort any non - linear processes such as fwm , due to the modification of the spatial intensity profiles .",
    "this raises the question , whether diffraction can be manipulated such that non - linear processes can be effective .    in order to suppress or even remove the diffraction ,",
    "different methods have been suggested .",
    "first , there are particular characteristic spatial modes which satisfy the paraxial propagation equation , and therefore can propagate in free space without change in their transverse profile  @xcite .",
    "these are airy  @xcite , bessel  @xcite , mathieu  @xcite and parabolic ( weber ) beams  @xcite .",
    "an alternative method is to induce a spatially - varying index of refraction experienced by the propagating light , effectively forming an optically written waveguide  @xcite .",
    "however , those schemes operating in position space typically only allow to propagate specific modes through a particular waveguide , and can not be applied to multimode fields .",
    "as an alternative approach , recently , firstenberg et al . have proposed  @xcite and demonstrated experimentally  @xcite a novel scheme to eliminate paraxial diffraction of a probe field carrying an arbitrary image encoded into its spatial profile  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to previous approaches , it operates in the momentum space .",
    "the method takes advantage of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) in a thermal atomic vapor , under the influence of atomic motion and collisions .",
    "these induce a linear susceptibility experienced by the propagating field which is @xmath0-square dependent in momentum space .",
    "this susceptibility can be manipulated in such a way , that the phase shifts giving rise to diffraction are exactly canceled .",
    "since the phase shift of each momentum component is eliminated individually , arbitrary images within a certain bandwidth can be propagated without diffraction .",
    "the method , however , necessarily involves strong single - photon absorption , since the diffraction can only be canceled at a negative two - photon detuning between the probe and control fields , leading to an imperfect eit condition .",
    "-configuration form the basic electromagnetically - induced transparency setup for the probe propagation .",
    "the fourth state together with an additional control beam lead to a four - level double-@xmath1 system . which enables four - wave mixing to generate an additional signal field .",
    "finally , a two - way incoherent pump field is applied to the fifth auxiliary state . in effect , the single - photon absorption for both the probe and signal fields are reduced , and the four - wave mixing process is enhanced .",
    "( b ) co - linear propagation of the four coherent fields in the thermal atomic medium to satisfy the phase matching condition . due to atomic motion",

    "we demonstrate how diffraction can be avoided in this conversion , by exploiting the atomic motion to cancel the paraxial diffraction of both the probe and signal fields simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , we show that an incoherent two - way pump field can be employed to improve the performance in various ways .",
    "it redistributes populations in zeroth order of the probe field , which together with the applied control fields leads to the formation of additional coherences .",
    "this on the one hand allows us to cancel linear absorption with non - linear gain such that the light intensities are maintained throughout the propagation . on the other hand",
    ", the pump field broadens the transverse momentum bandwidth which can be propagated without diffraction , such that smaller spatial structures become accessible .",

    "the fourth transition @xmath12 is not driven by an external field , but due to four - wave mixing , a signal field @xmath13 can be generated throughout the propagation of the light fields through the medium .",
    "finally , we apply an incoherent two - way pump field to the transition @xmath14  @xcite , which together with spontaneous decay from @xmath15 into the other states effectively forms a one - way pumping from @xmath3 into the other atomic states . here , @xmath16 is the dipole moment between states @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the slowly varying envelopes and unit polarization vectors of the electric fields with @xmath22 .",
    "the incoherent pump field induces a redistribution of the populations in zeroth order of the probe field , which together with the control fields leads to the formation of additional atomic coherences .",

    "the forward and backward fwm processes are balanced . at this point ,",
    "the normalized width of both signal and probe field has changed by less than one percent from the width of the initial probe field . in this initial propagation part ,",
    "linear single - photon absorption dominates , and the total power contained in both signal and probe fields together is attenuated . beyond @xmath137 , the nonlinear gain over - compensates the linear loss , such that the probe and signal intensity grows slightly .",
    "this growth in power is accompanied by a small growth in the widths of signal and probe fields , which is related to higher - order diffraction @xmath138 in the linear and nonlinear dispersions .",

    ", width=340 ]      to further analyze the effect of the incoherent pump beam on the propagation dynamics , we calculated the output power and width of both probe and signal fields as a function of pump intensity .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : power-1d ] for a gaussian probe field .",
    "we find that while the output power of the two fields can be controlled via the pump field over a large range , the output width only weakly depends on the pump power .",
    "this suggests that possible inhomogeneities in the incoherent pump field , which could , for example , arise due to absorption in the medium , will not significantly affect the outgoing spatial beam profiles and the diffraction - less propagation in the medium .",
    "we further find that the balanced distribution of the outgoing power between signal and probe field is preserved over a broad range of pump strengths as well .    while the initial purpose of the incoherent pump field was to induce atomic coherences via the control fields in zeroth order of the probe and signal field",
    ", we find that it has further less obvious positive effects on the system dynamics .",
    "first , the single - photon absorption without pump can be compensated or even turned into gain by the combination of reduced linear absorption and nonlinear gain from the atomic coherences .",
    "this suggests that the fwm process , which sensitively depends on the relative intensities of all applied fields , equilibrates in a rather short propagation distance .",
    "consequently , not only the efficiency of the fwm process is significantly improved , but also the broadening of both probe and signal fields due to residual diffraction before the fwm equilibrium is reached is considerably decreased .",
    "second , the incoherent pump further alleviates the demand for strong collision rates to achieve the dicke limit eq .",

    "[ fig : lin ] and  [ fig : nonlin ] grows rapidly as the incoherent pump increases , probe and signal fields with a larger transverse bandwidth , and in turn smaller spatial size can be propagated through the medium without diffraction in the thermal medium .      in order to demonstrate that our setup can operate on arbitrary images encoded onto the probe field",
    ", we finally propagated a two - dimensional image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : prop-2d ] through the thermal atom vapor .",
    "the incident image is represented by an array of values  0 \" and  1 \" in the transverse plane , which leads to the somewhat rough edges visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : prop-2d](a ) .",
    "in free space , as expected we find that the image is totally distorted after propagating one rayleigh length , see ( b ) .",
    "but in the thermal vapor , the image encoded onto the probe beam is well preserved due to the cancellation of the diffraction due to atomic motion . in comparison to the initial image , the sharp edges have been smoothed out , as they contain high - frequency transverse wave vector components outside the central susceptibility area @xmath141 . at the same time , the image is transfered to the signal field via the fwm process , see ( d ) .",
    "we have proposed a scheme to realize diffraction - less image propagation and frequency conversion based on four - wave mixing in a thermal atomic vapor .",
    "phase matching is achieved despite the thermal motion , which is exploited to achieve diffraction - less image propagation . in order to compensate the usually inevitable absorption , we applied a two - way incoherent field .",
    "it on the one hand modifies the linear and non - linear absorption such that overall , the probe and signal fields propagate without attenuation .",
    "but additionally , the pump field leads to a rapid equilibration of the fwm processes , which sensitively depends on the intensities of all applied fields .",
    "thereby , an image frequency conversion with negligible diffraction in the initial transient dynamics is achieved .",
    "furthermore , the additional pump field allows to enter the desired dicke regime already at lower densities , which is favorable for experimental implementations .",
    "finally , the pump field increases the transverse wave number bandwidth which can be propagated without diffraction through the thermal medium .",
    "we have shown that our method is capable of transmitting and frequency - converting complex two - dimensional images without diffraction , requiring only short propagation distances of less than one rayleigh length .    throughout the manuscript , we used parameters of the hyperfine structure of @xmath23 for the results , which is an atomic species routinely used in laboratories and therefore well suited for proof - of - principle experiments .",
    "but our setup can also be generalized to different systems , e.g. , to achieve conversion to other frequencies .",
    "the main considerations which led us to @xmath23 are as follows .",
    "a major restriction on the parameters arises from the fact that the doppler effect effectively reduces the coupling between the thermal vapor and the laser fields .",
    "therefore , usually a relatively high atomic density ( @xmath142 ) is required to achieve sufficient medium response to cancel the diffraction , which can lead to unwanted effects such as additional non - linear processes or collective interactions  @xcite . in order to reduce the required atomic density ,",
    "the population in the upper state @xmath15 should be minimized , which acts only as an auxiliary state in order to effectively convert the incoherent two - way pump field into a one - way pumping . for this",
    ", the spontaneous decay rate @xmath143 should ideally be much larger than @xmath144 .",
    "additionally , the couplings between atoms and the probe and signal fields should be as strong as possible to further reduce the atomic density , such that large dipole moment for @xmath145 and @xmath146 are desirable .",
    "lastly , the simultaneous elimination of diffraction for both fields in the same thermal vapor demands for matched coupling strengths , which further limits the choice of suitable @xmath145 and @xmath146 .    we recently became aware of related work by i. katzir et al . , who independently of us developed another method to eliminate paraxial diffraction using a fwm process  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , while the level schemes at first sight look rather similar , the involved physical processes are entirely different .",
    "the setup by katzir et al . and",
    "ours share the main principle of operating in the transverse wave vector space @xmath0 , such that diffraction of arbitrary images encoded onto the probe beam can be manipulated .",
    "but in contrast to the present work , katzir et al .",
    "do not rely on the dependence of @xmath0 induced by the thermal atom motion , but instead exploit a new mechanism based on the phase - matching condition of a suitably tailored 4wm process . in their scheme , a probe field with arbitrary transverse profile and a plane - wave control field",
    "interact with a three - level @xmath1 system in eit configuration .",
    "the control field further acts as a pump field to form an active raman gain ( arg )  @xcite process , which leads to generation of a _ conjugate _ fwm signal field . since for each wave component",
    "the produced conjugate signal field has an opposite phase dependence on the transverse wavevector as compared to the probe field , the diffraction for both fields can be tuned such that they cancel each other . as a result , the spatial profile of the probe field is well preserved , and copied to the signal field as in our proposal , while avoiding absorption via the non - linear gain .",
    "the two related yet different setups clearly highlight how versatile and intriguing the light propagation through atomic vapors becomes in particular if setups beyond the standard 3-level eit setup are considered , and pave the way for further studies operating in the transverse wave vector space applicable to arbitrary probe images .",

    "<S> it furthermore compensate linear absorption with non - linear gain , to improve the four - wave mixing performance since the propagation dynamics of the various field intensities is favorably modified . </S>"
