    ", we present some initial numerical simulations with small numbers of transition positions , sampling rate over maximal local rate of innovation and very low levels of noise .",
    "detailed noise performance analysis and stable recovery in the presence of other types of noises will be discussed in the coming paper .",
    "take a sampling kernel @xmath125 , and a bilevel signal @xmath126 containing 10 transition positions , see figure [ bilevelsignal.fig ] .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this note , we show that bilevel causal signals @xmath0 could be reconstructed from their samples @xmath5 , if the sampling kernel @xmath6 is causal and positive on @xmath23 and if the sample rate is at ( or above ) the maximal local rate of innovation of the bilevel signal @xmath0 .",
    "we also propose a stable bilevel signal recovery algorithm in the presence of bounded noise if the number of transition positions of bilevel signals is not large .",
