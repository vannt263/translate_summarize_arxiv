    "due to limited dimensions of calorimeters one from important questions of calorimetry concerns the energy leakage and related with it the deterioration of energy resolution , appearance of tails in the energy distributions and ultimately the deterioration of the quality obtained physics information . in this article",
    "we report on the results of the experimental study of hadronic shower leakage effects on the pion response and energy resolution of @xmath0 barrel hadron prototype calorimeter @xcite . because this calorimeter has innovative concept of longitudinal segmentation of active and passive layers ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] ) , the measurement of hadron showers leakage is of special interest @xcite .",
    "this investigation was performed on the basis of data from @xmath2 pion exposure of the prototype calorimeter at the @xmath14 beam of the @xmath15 @xmath16 at different @xmath4 impact points in the range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 with step @xmath17 ( @xmath4 scan ) at incident angle @xmath3 which were obtained in may 1995 .",
    "earlier some results related with leakage for this calorimeter were obtained in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the prototype calorimeter is composed of five sector modules , each spanning @xmath18 in azimuth , @xmath19 in the axial ( @xmath4 ) direction , @xmath20 in the radial direction , and with a front face of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the iron structure of each module consists of 57 repeated `` periods '' .",
    "each period is @xmath22 thick and consists of four layers .",
    "the first and third layers are formed by large trapezoidal steel plates ( master plates ) , @xmath23 thick and spanning the full radial dimension of the module . in the second and fourth layers , smaller trapezoidal steel plates ( spacer plates ) and scintillator tiles alternate along the radial direction .",
    "the spacer plates are @xmath24 thick and of 11 different sizes .",
    "scintillator tiles are @xmath25 thickness .",
    "the iron to scintillator ratio is 4.67:1 by volume .",
    "the calorimeter thickness at incidence angle @xmath3 corresponds to @xmath26 of iron equivalent ( 9.4 nuclear interaction length ) @xcite .",
    "radially oriented @xmath27 fibres collect light from the tiles at both of their open edges and bring it to photo - multipliers ( @xmath28 ) at the periphery of the calorimeter .",
    "each @xmath29 views a specific group of tiles , through the corresponding bundle of fibres . with this readout scheme three - dimensional segmentation",
    "is immediately obtained .",
    "tiles of 18 different shapes all have the same radial dimensions ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the prototype calorimeter is radially segmented into four depth segments by grouping fibres from different tiles .",
    "proceeding outward in radius , the three smallest tiles , @xmath31 are grouped into section @xmath32 , @xmath33 into section @xmath34 , @xmath35 into section @xmath36 and @xmath37 into section @xmath38 .",
    "the readout cell width in @xmath4 direction is about @xmath6 .",
    "construction and performance of @xmath0 iron - scintillator barrel hadron prototype calorimeter is described elsewhere @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the five modules have been positioned on a scanning table , able to allow high precision movements along any direction .",
    "upstream of the calorimeter , a trigger counter telescope was installed , defining a beam spot of @xmath17 diameter .",
    "two delay - line wire chambers , each with @xmath4 , @xmath39 readout , allowed to reconstruct the impact point of beam particles on the calorimeter face to better than @xmath40 @xcite . for the detection of the hadronic shower longitudinal and lateral leakages backward ( @xmath41 ) and side ( @xmath42 )",
    "`` @xmath43 '' punchthrough detector were placed behind and at the right side of the calorimeter modules @xcite .",
    "basic elements of `` @xmath43 '' are plastic scintillator detectors with dimensions @xmath44 which are read - out by 2-inch photomultipliers @xmath45 .",
    "the tag of given ( longitudinal or lateral ) leakage is at least one hit in corresponding `` @xmath46 '' .",
    "due to the number of photoelectrons in any scintillator counter of walls is roughly @xmath47 per minimum ionising particle `` @xmath43 '' detected charged particles with high efficiency . as a result we have for each event 200 values of charges from @xmath29 properly calibrated @xcite with",
    "pedestal subtracted .",
    "@xmath48 runs contained @xmath49 events with various @xmath4 coordinates have been analysed .",
    "the treatment was carried out using program @xmath50 @xcite .    the scintillator detector planes behind and back of the calorimeter",
    "give us possibility to select the event samples at different conditions : `` no leakage '' , only `` longitudinal leakage '' , only `` lateral leakage '' , `` longitudinal and lateral leakages '' simultaneously .    in this section",
    "the following issues are discussed :    1 .",
    "punchthrough probability , 2 .",
    "energy leakage , 3 .   the effect of leakage on energy resolution .",
    "first of all we determine the value of punchthrough probability .      by definition @xcite , @xcite ,",
    "@xcite the total hadronic punchthrough probability is the ratio of the number of events giving at least one hit in the punchthrough detector to the total number of trigger beam particles .",
    "it seems that the information needed is simple : hit or no hit .",
    "but there are some problems in definition of hit ( see , for example , discussion @xcite ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f4 ] our @xmath51 spectra one of `` @xmath46 '' counter ( @xmath52 in fig .",

    "spectrum in @xmath54 beam look similar to simulated distribution for iron - scintillator calorimeter @xcite as obtained by monte carlo calculations with @xmath55 ( fig .",
    "14 from @xcite ) .",
    "the region left from minimum ionising single particle distribution is related with the contribution of neutrons as punchthrough particles @xcite .",

    "note that the results of @xmath60 are not so much distinguished from a cut used in @xcite @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "we think that @xmath63 is more correct since it does not reject events with leakage . in following for the spectra analysis we use this @xmath12 .",

    "the event samples  `` any leakage '' , `` longitudinal leakage '' , `` longitudinal and lateral leakages '' have the low energy tails , the event samples  `` no leakage '' and `` lateral leakage '' have the high energy tails .",
    "the events sample with leakage naturally have the low energy tail . the high energy tail in the event sample `` no leakage '' was explained in @xcite by contribution of showers with unusually large electromagnetic component . the unexpected high energy tail in the event sample `` lateral leakage '' may be explained as these events are the events of type `` no leakage '' with some leakage unsufficient to cut the high energy tail",

    "[ fig : f11 ] shows the same normalised to average value of ( @xmath89 ) over the uniformity range for events without leakage .",
    "one can see that due to the tails the resolutions obtained by averaging are much greater ( approximately in two times for events with longitudinal leakage ) than ones obtained by @xmath66 fitting .",
    "the results of averaged by @xmath4 in their uniformity range of fig.s  [ fig : f9 ] , [ fig : f10 ] , [ fig : f11 ] are given in table  [ tb4 ] . as can be seen longitudinal energy leakage amounts @xmath81 , but deterioration of energy resolution for the same case @xmath89 amounts @xmath90 .",
    "the general degradation of the resolution with increasing of leakage is in agreement with earlier observations @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , our energy resolution degradation @xmath91 is in reasonable agreement with the parameterisation proposed by @xcite on the basis of the data from @xmath92 collaboration @xcite : @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95  energy and energy resolution for events without leakage , @xmath96 and @xmath97  energy and energy resolution for events with `` longitudinal leakage '' . in our case for the value of energy resolution degradation from ( [ eq3 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath98 .    in the case of lateral leakage the unexpected inverse behaviour",
    "is observed : energy leakage leads to some improving of the resolution .",
    "let us consider this in more detail . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f12 ] two distributions of the lateral leakage are shown : lateral energy leakage ( top ) , energy resolution ( @xmath89 ) ( bottom ) for the event sample with lateral leakage as a function of @xmath4 coordinate .",
    "[ fig : f13 ] presents the energy resolution as a function of lateral leakage for this event sample .",
    "as can be seen the energy resolution improves with increasing lateral energy leakage at least to the value of lateral energy leakage equal to @xmath8 at @xmath99 where energy resolution is improving to @xmath9",
    ".    this phenomenon can be explained as follows .",
    "the hadronic shower consists of electromagnetic and pure hadronic parts and the electromagnetic part in lateral direction places in the central core @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so by cutting some lateral hadronic part we `` improve '' the shower properties , make it less fluctuating .",
    "however this may be the specific property of our calorimeter .",
    "we have investigated the hadronic shower longitudinal and lateral leakages and its effect on the pion response and energy resolution on the basis of @xmath2 pion beam data at incidence angle @xmath3 at impact points @xmath4 in the range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "some results are following :    * the fraction of the energy of @xmath2 pions at @xmath3 leaking out at the back of this calorimeter amounts to @xmath7 and agrees with the one for a conventional iron - scintillator calorimeter .",
    "* unexpected behaviour of the energy resolution as a function of leakage is observed : @xmath8 lateral leakage leads to @xmath9 improving of energy resolution in compare to events with the showers without leakage . * the measured value of longitudinal punchthrough probability @xmath11 agrees with the one for a conventional iron - scintillator calorimeter with the same nuclear interaction length thickness and with the earlier measurement @xcite .",
