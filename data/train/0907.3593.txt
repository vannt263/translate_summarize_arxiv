    "the @xmath3 and @xmath4 production yields assumed as the baseline for alice simulation studies are : for pp collisions at @xmath2 , 0.16 and 0.007 , respectively  @xcite ( and lower by about 25% at 10  tev , the envisaged energy of the first long pp run ) ; for the 5% most central pb ",

    "heavy quark medium - induced quenching is one of the most captivating topics to be addressed in collisions at the lhc . due to the qcd nature of parton energy loss , quarks",
    "are predicted to lose less energy than gluons ( that have a higher colour charge ) and , in addition , the ` dead - cone effect ' is expected to reduce the energy loss of massive quarks with respect to light partons  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one should observe a pattern of decreasing suppression when going from the mostly gluon - originated light - flavour hadrons ( @xmath6 or @xmath7 ) to d and b mesons . in terms of the pb  pb - to - pp nuclear modification factors of the @xmath8-differential yields : @xmath9  @xcite .",
