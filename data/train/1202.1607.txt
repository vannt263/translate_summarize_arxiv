    "recently , the discovery of a new type of iron - based superconducting ( sc ) compounds a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 ( a = tl , k , rb , cs ) has attracted much attention  @xcite .",
    "both the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments  @xcite and the local density approximation ( lda ) calculations  @xcite have reported that the hole fermi surface ( fs ) pockets disappear and only electron ones exist .",
    "thus this compound may be heavily electron - doped , which challenges the current physical picture for iron - based sc materials .",
    "due to the absence of the hole - like fs , obviously , the inter - band fs nesting picture  @xcite , which seems to work well for iron pnictides , is unable to straightforwardly account for the superconductivity of this compound .",
    "the pairing symmetry is also an important and critical issue to be addressed , which may be different from that of iron pnictides due to the absence of the hole fs pockets .",
    "actually , the arpes experiments  @xcite indicated that the fs pockets around the @xmath7-point are fully gapped while near the @xmath8 point the gap is negligibly small  @xcite , which is contrast to the @xmath9-wave symmetry . up to now , the pairing symmetry is still unclear : both @xmath10-wave and @xmath6-wave symmetries have been proposed  @xcite .    due to the presence of magnetism in the parent compound ,",
    "usually the spin excitation is proposed to account for superconductivity in high - tc materials  @xcite .",
    "it is natural and important to ask whether this picture still works well in iron selenides .",
    "this issue was first studied theoretically based on the five - orbital model .",
    "the @xmath6-wave pairing symmetry , which meditated by the spin dynamics , was proposed  @xcite ; while the results of spin susceptibility are different , with the @xmath11-spin excitation proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath12-one proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "experimentally the inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiment is one of the most powerful ways to study the spin excitations and can provide us directly the imaginary part of the spin susceptibility in the whole momentum and frequency space .",
    "the ins experiments on iron selenides have been reported by several groups . for the insulating parent compound ,",
    "a @xmath13 spin excitation was reported , indicating the presence of vacancy order and block antiferromagnetic ( af ) ground state  @xcite . for the sc compound",
    ", the ins experiments have revealed several channels of spin excitations  @xcite around the @xmath13 , @xmath5 , and @xmath14 , respectively . among them",
    "the @xmath13 excitation accounts for the vacancy ordered phase .",
    "the presence of @xmath14 excitation seems controversial : it was indicated in refs .",
    "@xcite that no spin excitation at this wave vector was observed , but , on the contrary , the @xmath14 spin excitation was very recently reported in ref .",
    "it may come from the localized moments in the sc state  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath5 spin excitation was found to be rather robust in the sc state possibly due to the fs nesting  @xcite .",
    "notably , this excitation is enhanced significantly at the frequency @xmath15 ev , corresponding to the spin resonance at this frequency .",
    "the resonant spin excitation is a common feature for high - tc superconductors and thus it may be related to superconductivity intimately , providing an insight for exploring the mechanism and pairing symmetry of superconductivity .    to study spin excitations and other physical properties theoretically , it is highly - demanded and desirable to establish a minimum model that is able to capture the essential features of this compound .",
    "firstly , the vacancy order can be neglected when studying the physics of superconductivity .",
    "it has been reported by several groups that the phase separation occurs in the sc state , with a vacancy ordered state only existing in the insulating region  @xcite .",
    "based on the arpes experiments  @xcite there is no band folding effect corresponding to the vacancy order wave vector , also seems to propose that the vacancy order does not exist in the sc state . as a result , the vacancy order should not be relevant to superconductivity and need not to be concerned for a minimum model .    from the band calculations for this compound  @xcite",
    ", it seems that all of the five orbitals hybridize strongly , and thus it was proposed that all five @xmath6-orbitals should be considered to construct a model  @xcite .",
    "note that the five - orbital model is one of the most frequently - used model to describe the iron - pnictide compound  @xcite .",
    "however , this model includes some non - essential parts that may be redundant for superconductivity ( especially those bands far away from the fs ) , and even makes it quite difficult to accurately analyze and understand certain essential physics behind because too many unknown parameters are involved .",
    "for example , if the electron correlation needs to be included , both inter - orbital and intra - orbital interactions should be taken into account ; while the corresponding interaction strengths are difficult to be determined ( or adjusted ) in order to figure out the relevant physics .",
    "motivated by this , a minimum two - band model was proposed for iron pnictides  @xcite , and many physical properties have been understood based on this type of two - band model , especially for those related closely to the low - energy excitations . when studying the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 materials ,",
    "a similar two - orbital model was put forward , while the obtained fs size is much larger than that obtained from the band calculation  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , as discussed below , we can refine the minimum model of this compound to have one band to capture the essential physics with better results . as seen from the band calculations  @xcite ,",
    "there exist two electron - like fs sheets around the @xmath16 point . around the @xmath17 point ,",
    "a small fs pocket may exist , but it is k@xmath18 dependent and electron - like .",
    "the fss from arpes experiments are consistent with the lda calculations while the electron pockets around the @xmath17 point have a very low spectral weight .",
    "so it is reasonable to believe that only the fs pockets around m point are essential for constructing a minimum model , while all other bands that do not cross the fermi energy may be neglected .",
    "taking into account that one unit cell consists of two iron ions plus the band folding effect , only one kind of fs pocket around the @xmath19 or its symmetric points is actually relevant in the unfolded bz .    in this paper , motivated by the above considerations , we propose a single - band tight - banding model as a minimum one for the sc a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "our model could have a band dispersion crossing the fs , being qualitatively consistent with that of the five - orbital model  @xcite fitted from the lda band calculations and the arpes experiments for the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 materials  @xcite .",
    "thus the present model may serve as an effective one for describing the low energy physics of the a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "the normal state spin susceptibility is calculated and then analyzed based on the fs topology .",
    "the sc gap is also calculated self - consistently , with the robust @xmath6-wave sc pairing being revealed .",
    "the @xmath6-wave symmetry can well be understood by the spin fluctuation picture and the fermiology theory .",
    "the sc state spin excitations are investigated further with the @xmath6-wave symmetry .",
    "the resonant spin excitation at @xmath5 is observed , which is consistent with recent ins experiments and thus provides a certain kind of support for the @xmath6-wave symmetry in a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 sc materials .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the model and work out the formalism . in sec .",
    "iii , we perform numerical calculations and interpret the obtained results . the band structure , pairing symmetry and spin excitations are elaborated , respectively .",
    "finally , we give a brief summary in sec .",
    "we start from a @xmath20 type model including the tight - banding term and the local spin interaction , which reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is phenomenologically taken as the single band tight - banding approximation : @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the local spin interaction . from the first principle calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume the spin interaction to include the nearest - neighbor and the next - nearest - neighbor interactions  @xcite : @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the summation over the nearest and next - nearest neighbors , respectively . in the present work , we set @xmath28 .",
    "the bare spin susceptibility determined from the tight - banding part can be calculated as , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "the correction of the spin fluctuation induced by the spin - spin interaction @xmath24 may be included in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the fourier factor of the spin coupling term @xmath24 .",
    "considering that the sc pairing is meditated by the spin fluctuation , we may write the linearized eliashberg s equation , @xmath33 where @xmath34 .",
    "we consider the spin - fluctuation as the effective pairing potential @xmath35 .",
    "since we here address the pairing symmetry , we focus only on the zero - energy spin susceptibility , which should produce qualitatively correct results for the pairing symmetry as usual  @xcite .    with the sc order parameter , the bare spin susceptibility in the sc state can be expressed as , @xmath36 \\frac{f(e_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q}})-f(e_{{\\bf k}})}{\\omega - e_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q}}+e_{{\\bf k}}+i\\gamma}\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{4}[1-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\bf k}\\varepsilon_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q}}+\\delta_{\\bf k}\\delta_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q}}}{e_{\\bf k}e_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q } } } ] \\frac{1-f(e_{{\\bf k}-{\\bf q}})-f(e_{{\\bf k}})}{\\omega+e_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q}}+e_{{\\bf k}}+i\\gamma}\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{4}[1-\\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\bf k}\\varepsilon_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q}}+\\delta_{\\bf k}\\delta_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q}}}{e_{\\bf k}e_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q } } } ] \\frac{f(e_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q}})+f(e_{{\\bf k}})-1}{\\omega - e_{{\\bf k}+{\\bf q}}-e_{{\\bf k}}+i\\gamma}\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the quasiparticle energy in the sc state with @xmath38 . the renormalized spin susceptibility in the framework of rpa",
    "can be obtained by eq.(4 ) .",
    "based on the five - band model , there are three bands below the fermi energy and one band above it  @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to concentrate on the band that crosses the fs , which plays an essential role in superconductivity . considering that the electron filling per fe site is @xmath39 , the three filled bands contribute six electrons per site and thus the electron filling for the band that crosses the fermi energy is @xmath40 .",
    "these features are crucially captured by the the present single - band model .",
    "we depict in fig.1(a ) the band dispersion with the hopping constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 being set as @xmath43 ev and @xmath44 ev , respectively .",
    "the chemical potential is controlled by the doping density @xmath40 with @xmath45 .",
    "considering one unit cell including two fe irons , we plot the band dispersion in the folded brillouin zone in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the low energy band dispersion is qualitatively consistent with the five - orbital model and lda calculation  @xcite . while here the band width is much smaller than those obtained from five - orbital model",
    "actually , the five - orbital is usually fitted from the lda calculation , which should generate qualitatively correct fs while usually the band width is larger due to neglecting the electron correlations . in the present work ,",
    "a smaller renormalized hoping constant is used and the obtained band width and doping density are consistent with the arpes experimental results  @xcite .",
    "the pairing symmetry is one of the most important issues , which can provide us the information of the pairing mechanism . while this is still under debate for a@xmath0fe@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "experimentally it has been revealed that the order parameter is nodeless and nearly isotropic along the fs pockets  @xcite .",
    "since no phase - sensitive measurement has so far been reported , both @xmath10-wave and nodeless @xmath6-wave symmetries may be able to reproduce the experimental results .",
    "theoretically , some predicted that the order parameter should have @xmath6-wave pairing  @xcite and some proposed the @xmath10-wave symmetry  @xcite .",
    "there are also some theories suggested that the pairing symmetry is either @xmath6-wave or @xmath10-wave , or even a mixture of them  @xcite .     along different momentum cut .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    we now study the pairing symmetry based on the spin dynamics scenario . in the rpa framework , the spin susceptibility are mainly determined from the two factors : one is the bare spin susceptibility @xmath48 evaluated from the tight - banding term and the other is the rpa factor @xmath49 closely related to the local spin interaction .",
    "the behavior of the bare spin susceptibility is usually determined by the fs topology , with the maximum spin excitation occurring at the nesting wave vector . for the renormalized one , the pattern of @xmath50 , representing the spin interaction strength in the fourier space , plays an important role . while at present the parameters @xmath51 in @xmath50 are difficult to be determined theoretically .",
    "they usually deviate from the actually value of interchange integral constants . in cuprates",
    "it is estimated roughly from the af critical point  @xcite or the spin resonance frequency  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we consider several values of @xmath52 to explore the renormalized spin susceptibility .",
    "the bare and renormalized spin susceptibility along the two - dimensional cut are plotted in fig.2(a ) .",
    "the intensity plot of the renormalized spin susceptibility in the whole bz is plotted in fig.2(b ) .",
    "as is seen , the bare spin susceptibility shows two broad features around the momentums @xmath53 and @xmath11 . here the maximum spin susceptibilities at four wave vectors @xmath54 are revealed . in the rpa approach ,",
    "the spin excitations around @xmath53 are suppressed and those around @xmath11 enhanced , respectively .",
    "as @xmath52 increases to 0.25 ev , the maximum spin excitation appears at the momentum @xmath55 .",
    "the @xmath5-spin excitation can be seen more clearly from fig.2(b ) . as displayed ,",
    "four peaks appear at the wave vector @xmath5 and its symmetric points .",
    "this result is qualitatively consistent with the recent ins experiments  @xcite .",
    "a further comparison between our theoretical results with ins experiments will be presented in sec.iii(c ) .",
    "we here look into the pairing symmetry from eq.(5 ) , namely , the temperature @xmath56 is decreased until the maximum eigenvalue @xmath57 is obtained , with the sc gap being the eigenvector for the maximum eigenvalue .",
    "the intensity plot of the sc gap is displayed in fig.3(a ) .",
    "obviously , the pairing symmetry is of @xmath3-wave .",
    "we have checked numerically that this result is rather robust to the reasonable parameter change .",
    "the sc gap along the fs for the @xmath6-wave pairing symmetry @xmath58 is plotted in fig.3(b ) .",
    "as is seen , the sc gap along one fs sheet is nearly isotropic with the difference less than 10% , being consistent with the arpes experiments  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was reported in arpes experiments that the gap is small or vanishing for the smaller pockets around the @xmath17 point  @xcite , being also qualitatively consistent with the @xmath3-wave .",
    "however , it was indicated in refs .  @xcite that there exists a larger fs pockets around @xmath17 with the gap being nearly isotropic , which seems to contradict with the @xmath6-wave symmetry .",
    "while we think that the larger fs around @xmath17 may come from the band folding effect : dominant features of the pocket and the gap may be folded from those around @xmath16 point . if this is the case , our results for the gap symmetry agree qualitatively with the arpes experiments .",
    "( b ) the gap along the fs sheets with the dashed and solid lines are around the x and y points , respectively , with @xmath59 denoted in panel ( a).,width=302 ]    the above results of the spin fluctuation can be addressed soundly based on the fermiology picture . the fs is plotted in fig.4 .",
    "the fs sheets around @xmath60 and its symmetric points are clearly seen .",
    "we denoted the nesting wave vectors ( @xmath54 ) in fig.4  @xcite .",
    "as seen , all of the maximum bare spin excitations shown in fig.2a are related to the fs nesting .",
    "based on the fermiology and eq.(3 ) , it is rather clear that the spin susceptibility reaches its largest value at @xmath61 because @xmath62 is vanishingly small .",
    "we now elucidate the origin of the @xmath6-wave symmetry . at the rpa approach ,",
    "the spin excitations at @xmath63 from intra - pocket fs nestings are suppressed and those at @xmath64 from the inter - pocket ones enhanced .",
    "thus the inter - pocket scattering should play major role to achieve superconductivity .",
    "the pairing potential @xmath65 contributed by the spin fluctuation is largest at the wave vector @xmath66 .",
    "the factor @xmath67 in eq.(5 ) is positive for any @xmath68 and largest at @xmath69 , which means that the pairing near the fs is important .",
    "the gap function at or near the fs should satisfy the condition @xmath70 according to eq.(5 ) .",
    "as shown in fig.4 , if @xmath71 belongs to one sheet of fs , then @xmath72 should be near the other neighboring sheet of fs .",
    "for the @xmath3-symmetry , as displayed in fig.4(b ) , the sc gaps have the same magnitudes and different signs along the two neighboring fs sheets .",

    "moreover , the slight shift of the peak center as the frequency increases and the weak dispersion behavior are also consistent with the experimental results  @xcite .     as a function of the momentum with the energies @xmath15 ev and @xmath83 ev , respectively.,width=234 ]    in the following , we study the frequency dependence of the spin excitations at the wave vector @xmath77 . here",
    "three kinds of pairing symmetry , namely , the @xmath3-wave pairing symmetry with @xmath73 , @xmath9-pairing symmetry with @xmath84 , and isotropic @xmath10-wave pairing symmetries with @xmath85 , are considered .",
    "as is known , all of the three pairings would generate isotropic sc magnitude along the fs .",
    "the imaginary parts of spin susceptibility im@xmath86 as a function of frequency in the normal state and sc state are presented in fig .",
    "we observe clearly that for the @xmath6-wave pairing symmetry , the spin susceptibility at the frequency @xmath87 ev is enhanced significantly , indicating the spin resonance for this energy . for the @xmath9 and isotropic @xmath10-wave pairing symmetry , the low energy spin susceptibilities are always less than those in the normal state .",
    "thus there is no resonant spin excitation for these two symmetries .",
    "this significant difference between the @xmath6-wave symmetry and @xmath10-wave symmetry is interesting and this feature can be used to determine the pairing symmetry through comparing with the experiments .",
    "the above difference of the spin excitations can be understood through analyzing the coherence factor @xmath88 in eq.(6 ) with @xmath89 .",
    "the spin excitation is enhanced as @xmath90 ( with @xmath71 and @xmath91 being the momentum close to the fs ) .",
    "this condition can only be satisfied for the @xmath6-wave pairing symmetry , which provides a natural explanation for the resonant spin excitation .",
    "the origin of the spin resonance can be clarified further in the framework of rpa . the bare spin susceptibility and the pra factor with the @xmath6-wave pairing",
    "are plotted in fig.6(b ) . as seen , due to the presence of the sc gap , the imaginary part of the bare spin susceptibility approaches to zero at low energies , ascribed to the spin gap .",
    "at the edge of the spin gap ( near @xmath92 ) , it has a steplike rise . in the mean time , the real part of the bare spin susceptibility re@xmath48 develops a sharp structure and reaches the maximum at this frequency .",
    "thus the rpa factor reaches the minimum ( or sometimes equals to zero corresponding to a strong resonant state at the frequency @xmath93 ) at this frequency , which plays the major role for the appearance of the spin resonance state .     in the normal state and sc states with different symmetries , respectively .",
    "( b)the bare spin susceptibilities versus the energy .",
    "the black line denotes the real part and the red line imaginary part , respectively .",
    "the green line is the real part of the rpa factor .",
