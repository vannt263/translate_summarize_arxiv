    "higher - order contributions to the quark condensate in nuclear matter due to nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interactions have been studied using various models @xcite .",
    "it is found that at normal nuclear matter density they change the leading - order result by only about 5% @xcite .",
    "the decrease of quark condensate in medium may lead to reduced hadron masses as shown in qcd sum - rule studies @xcite .",
    "the study of chiral symmetry breaking and partial restoration in hot dense matter is a topic of great current interest in nuclear physics @xcite .    in high energy heavy - ion collisions , theoretical simulations based on transport models have shown that a hot dense hadronic matter is formed in the initial stage of the collisions .",
    "this provides thus the possibility of studying the partial restoration of chiral symmetry through the changes of hadron properties in medium @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions is very complex , involving a violent initial compression , which is then followed by a relatively slow expansion and finally reaches the freeze out when particle interactions become unimportant .",
    "the entire reaction typically lasts for about a few tens fm / c . the interesting physics of hadron in - medium properties and chiral symmetry restoration",
    "can only be studied for a few fm / c during the early part of the expansion stage when both the density and temperature of the hadronic matter are high .",
    "this stage of the collision can in principle be probed by detecting the emitted electromagnetic radiation such as the real and virtual ( dilepton ) photons . however , both are not easy to measure due to their small rates .",
    "furthermore , they can also be produced from initial hard collisions and final hadron decays , and this makes it difficult to extract the signals from the hot dense matter .",
    "what are usually measured in heavy - ion experiments are instead the momentum distributions of hadrons , such as the nucleon , nuclear clusters , pion , kaon , etc .",
    ", which are mostly ejected from the colliding system at freeze out . to infer what have happened in the initial hot dense matter from the final hadron phase space distributions requires thus a model that can describe the whole collision process .",
    "indeed , various transport models have been developed during the past ten years for this purpose .",
    "we shall review briefly the history of the development of transport models .",
    "we note that a number of good review articles are available on both relativistic and nonrelativistic transport models for heavy - ion collisions at various energies @xcite .    since the reduced hadron masses in medium",

    ", the effective hadron mass is connected to the scalar field while its energy is shifted by the vector potential .",

    "furthermore , the dense nuclear matter also provides a strong mean - field vector potential , which then affects the momentum distributions of hadrons .",
    "the relation of the walecka model to the chiral effective field theory has recently been explored in refs .",
    "the attractive scalar and repulsive vector potentials for a nucleon in nuclear matter have also been obtained in the dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock ( dbhf ) approach @xcite as well as the qcd sum - rule studies @xcite .    for heavy - ion collisions at energies available from the sis at gsi , the relativistic transport model gives a satisfactory explanation for the observed enhancement of kaon @xcite , antikaon @xcite , and antiproton yields @xcite as well as low energy pions in the transverse direction @xcite .",

    ", hadron properties in dense matter are discussed using various theoretical approaches , such as the walecka model , the dbhf approach , the qcd sum - rule approach , and the effective hadronic model . the relativistic transport model based on the nonlinear @xmath18-@xmath19 model",

    "the results obtained from the relativistic transport model for particle production and flow in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies , the strangeness enhancement in heavy - ion collisions at ags and sps energies , and dilepton production in heavy - ion collisions are then presented and compared with the experimental data .",
    "the relevance of these experimental observables as the probes of hadron properties in dense matter is emphasized . a summary and outlook is then given in section v.",
    "theoretically , lattice qcd simulations should provide us with the most reliable information about the temperature and/or density dependence of hadron properties .",
    "currently , these simulations can be carried out only for finite temperature systems with zero baryon chemical potential .",

    "the hadron screening masses have been obtained in the lattice qcd @xcite . in a recent paper , boyd _",
    "et al _ @xcite have shown that , up to about 0.92@xmath20 , where @xmath20 is the critical temperature for the quark - gluon to hadronic matter phase transition , there is no significant change of the rho - meson screening mass .",
    "they have also found that the quark condensate does not change very much until one is extremely close to the critical temperature .",
    "this is in contrast with the result from chiral perturbation theory which shows a more appreciable decrease of the quark condensate with temperature @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of hadron properties in dense nuclear matter at present time has to rely on theoretical models . in this section",
    ", we shall review some of these approaches .",
    "in particular , the properties of baryons ( mainly nucleon ) , pseudoscalar mesons ( mainly pion and kaon ) , and vector mesons ( mainly rho , omega , and phi mesons ) will be discussed .",

    "nucleon properties in dense matter have also been studied in approaches based on the qcd . in the qcd sum - rule approach @xcite , hadron properties",

    "the qcd sum rules have been quite successful in describing the hadron properties in free space , e.g , the nucleon mass is quantitatively reproduced in this approach @xcite .",
    "the extension of qcd sum rules to hadrons in nuclear matter is achieved by using in - medium condensates . for a nucleon",

    "the mean - field potentials for resonances are thus needed in transport models , and up to now have been assumed to be the same as those for a nucleon .",
    "this assumption for a delta particle seems to be supported by analyses of the pion - nucleus scattering data @xcite .",

    "this would lead to a larger net attraction for a delta resonance than for a nucleon in nuclear medium .    also of interest",
    "is the potentials for hyperons in nuclear matter . as for nucleon ,",
    "most of the empirical information about hyperons in nuclear matter have been extracted from the structure of hypernuclei .",

    "the result ranges from -25 to -40 mev , depending on the input boson - exchange models for the @xmath61 interaction .",
    "there have also been various attempts to generalize the walecka - type model from su(2 ) to su(3 ) to include the hyperon degrees of freedom @xcite . in the naive su(3 ) quark model , the hyperon potential is about 2/3 of the nucleon potential , as there are only two light quarks in a hyperon instead of three light quarks in a nucleon .",

    "pseudoscalar mesons play a special role in nuclear physics . on the one hand , they are the goldstone bosons of spontaneously broken chiral symmetry and are thus closely related to chiral symmetry restoration in nuclear medium . furthermore , their small masses make the chiral perturbation theory applicable for low energy phenomena @xcite . on the other hand , in heavy - ion collisions , pions are the most copiously produced particles ; e.g. , at sps energies , the pion / nucleon ratio approaches 10 in midrapidity region . knowledge on the properties of pseudoscalar mesons in medium is thus very important for understanding both chiral symmetry restoration and the dynamics of high energy heavy - ion collisions .",

    "@xcite , the contribution from the delta - delta interaction is slightly smaller than that from the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",

    "@xcite , deltas are allowed to decay only at final stage of the collision .",

    "secondly , kaon production in refs .",
    "@xcite is calculated in the qmd with a skyrme - type momentum - independent mean - field potential .",
    "it is well - known that introducing a momentum - dependence in the nucleon mean - field potential , which is automatically included in the relativistic transport model @xcite , reduces the number of two - body collisions and hence the delta abundance , thus leading to a smaller contribution from the delta - delta interaction as compared to the case with a momentum - independent mean - field potential .",
    "although the interaction of a kaon with a nucleon is relatively weak as compared to other hadrons , they are still scattered by baryons in the dense medium @xcite .",

    "these final - state interactions change the kaon momentum spectra but not its total yield , leading to an increase of both its yield and the slope of its spectra at large angles . actually , final - state interactions help to bring the theoretical results at @xmath235 in better agreement with the experimental data . since final - state interactions increase the kaon yield at large angles , it would be of interest to have experimental data to test this prediction .",
    "effects of the attractive scalar potential can be more clearly seen in antikaon production than in kaon production as it leads to a significant reduction of the q - value for the reaction @xmath236 in nuclear medium as shown in fig .",

    "it has been usually assumed that the same cross section is applicable for antikaon production from the delta - nucleon and the delta - delta interaction .    including all final - state interactions ( propagation in mean fields , elastic scattering , and absorption ) for antikaons ,",

    "they move relatively fast and escape thus from the fireball while its size has increased only slightly . but these antikaons must use up much of their kinetic energies to climb out of the deep potential well so that the measured kinetic energies are substantially smaller . on the other hand ,",

    "the low mass phi mesons thus also provide information about the temperature at which the quark - gluon plasma to hadronic matter transition occurs .",
    "because of the partial restoration of chiral symmetry , the quark condensate decreases in hot dense matter . according to the prediction of qcd sum rules ,",
    "hadron masses are then reduced in medium . as a result ,",
    "the thresholds for particle production in medium are reduced , and the cross sections for their production are enhanced due to the increase of phase space in the final states .",
    "the dense matter also gives rise to strong vector mean - field potentials . with these medium effects",
    "consistently included in the relativistic transport model , it has been shown that for heavy - ion collisions at sis energies they can account for the observed enhancement of kaon , antikaon , and antiproton yields , the enhanced soft pions in the transverse direction , and particle flows in these collisions .    to place these conclusions on a firmer ground ,",
    "a number of issues need to be addressed in future investigations . in heavy - ion collisions at sis energies ,",
    "the colliding system consists mainly of nucleons , baryon resonances , and pions .",
    "particles can thus be produced from baryon - baryon , baryon - meson , and meson - meson collisions .",
    "because of the small center - of - mass energy of the pion and the fact that pions materialize in the expansion stage of the collisions , hadron production from pion - pion interactions can be safely neglected at sis energies .",
    "kaon and antikaon production from pion - baryon collisions have been calculated and found to account for about 20% of their total yield . with improved experimental data , these contributions need to be more carefully studied .",
    "similarly , antiproton production from pion - baryon collisions has not been considered and certainly need to be evaluated .    for subthreshold particle production ,",
    "the most important contribution comes from baryon - baryon interactions , of which interactions involving baryon resonances are particularly important .",
    "one needs thus particle production cross sections in baryon - baryon collisions . for proton - proton collisions there",
    "exist empirical data for kaon , antikaon , and antiproton production , mostly at high beam energies @xcite .",
    "the general strategy in the transport model is to introduce a parameterization for these data and then to extrapolate it to the threshold .",
    "the production cross section near the threshold then depends on the way the parameterization and extrapolation are introduced .",
    "this is particularly serious for antiprotons since there are essentially no experimental data below 20 gev .",
    "moreover , no experimental data exist for particle production from baryon - baryon collisions involving baryon resonances .",
    "various assumptions have been made to relate these cross sections to that in proton - proton collisions .",
    "the validity of these assumptions certainly need to be carefully assessed .",
    "also , the role of baryon resonances that are higher than the delta needs to be further investigated @xcite .    for antikaon and antiproton , there is an additional complication from their large annihilation cross sections .",
    "this raises the question of numerically how to accurately treat the annihilation process in transport models .",
    "indeed , different treatment of antiproton annihilation could lead to almost an order of magnitude difference in the final antiproton survival probability @xcite .",
    "moreover , the antikaon and antiproton annihilation cross sections might be modified in medium due to changes in their masses , the screening effects from mesons @xcite , and the effect of bose - einstein enhancement in the final state @xcite . for antiproton annihilation , which leads to about five pions",
    ", the latter effect is expected to be important in heavy - ion collisions at ags and sps energies as the abundance of pions is large in these collisions .",
    "the medium modification of hadron masses has so far been included in transport models only in a minimum way by changing the threshold of particle production . in terms of feynman diagrams ,",
    "this amounts to change only the masses of the initial and final hadrons . in principle , the properties of exchanged particles can also be modified @xcite . besides changes of hadron masses , the coupling constants and the form factors in the vertices of feynman diagrams might be modified in medium as well .",
    "all these need to be consistently studied .",
    "finally , off - shell propagation of particles has been neglected in all transport models . this effect on subthreshold particle production",
    "has been shown to be small @xcite . however",
    ", off - shell effects due to correlations in the initial wave function may be important and need to be further studied .",
    "for heavy - ion collisions at ags energies , medium effects can also explain the enhanced @xmath0 ratio , the difference between the slope parameters of @xmath1 and @xmath2 transverse kinetic energy spectra , the lower apparent temperature of antiprotons than that of protons , and the cool kaons with low transverse masses .",
    "however , these studies have been based on a fireball initial conditions so the initial nonequilibrium dynamics is not included .",
    "there are already models , such as the rqmd @xcite , arc @xcite , and art @xcite , which can treat the initial stage of heavy - ion collisions at these energies as enough inelasticity has been introduced in these models",
    ". it will be useful to extend the relativistic transport model by including these additional processes so both the collision dynamics and medium effects can be properly included .",
    "medium effects are also relevant for heavy - ion collisions at higher energies from the sps at cern .",
    "the reduced particle production thresholds in medium have been found to lead to enhanced production of phi mesons , antilambdas , and low - mass dileptons . as in the case of heavy - ion collisions at ags energies , the relativistic transport model at its present form",
    "can only describe the expansion stage of these collisions . in the initial nonequilibrium stage , particle production from string fragmentation has shown to be essential @xcite .",
    "it is thus again important to extend the relativistic transport model to include consistently in the initial stage the string dynamics .",
    "such a step has already being taken by cassing _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "we have shown in this review that high energy heavy - ion experiments offer the possibility to study the properties of hadrons in the hot dense matter formed in the initial stage of the collisions .",
    "this study is not only of interest in its own right but also important for future heavy - ion experiments at ultrarelativistic energies where the quark - gluon plasma is expected to be formed . to find the signatures of the quark - gluon plasma , it is essential to have a good understanding of the hadronic matter that exists both in the initial and final stages of heavy - ion collisions",
    "moreover , the modification of hadron properties in hot dense matter is expected to give rise to new signals for the quark - gluon to hadronic matter transition . for example",
    ", a low mass phi peak besides the normal one has been predicted to appear in the dilepton invariant mass spectra from ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions as a result of the decay of phi mesons with reduced in - medium mass during the transition .",
    "furthermore , measurements of the transverse momentum distribution of these low mass phi mesons offer a viable means for determining the temperature of the transition .",
    "however , experience from heavy - ion collisions at sis , ags , and cern energies has shown that to extract useful physics from heavy - ion collisions requires transport models which can describe properly the entire collision dynamics .",
    "the same is expected for heavy - ion collisions at rhic , so it is important to have a model which includes the initial parton cascade @xcite , the evolution of the resulting quark - gluon matter @xcite , the dynamics of hadronization @xcite , and the final hadronic dynamics . in this respect ,",
    "the relativistic transport model developed extensively for low energy heavy - ion collisions provides a link of future developments in ultra - relativistic transport model to the experimental observations .",
