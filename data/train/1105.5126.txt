    "thanks to the vast collection of data on grbs and their afterglows in the _ swift _ era ( nousek et al .",
    "2006 ; obrien et al . 2006 ; willingale et al . 2007 ; evans et al .",
    "2009 ) , we now have a detailed picture of the temporal behavior of the x - ray emission from these violent cosmic explosions . using light curves obtained by the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) onboard the _ swift _ satellite , five phases that are common to many x - ray afterglow light curves were identified : a steep decay phase , a shallow decay phase , a normal decay phase , a post jet break phase , and x - ray flares ( zhang et al .",
    "not all bursts exhibit all five phases .",
    "the normal decay and post jet break phases were predicted pre-_swift _ and are well - explained by the standard external shock afterglow model ( mszros & rees 1997 ; sari et al . 1998 ; rhoads 1999 ; sari et al . 1999 ) . _",
    "swift _ observations have challenged the grb community to create physical models that account for the other three phases . of these phases ,",
    "the shallow decay phase has definitely posed the biggest challenge . generally , no spectral evolution is observed across the temporal break from the shallow to the normal decay phase ( liang et al .",
    "this suggests that the shallow - to - normal transition should be either hydrodynamical or geometrical in origin .",
    "many such physical models of the shallow decay phase have been discussed in the literature , but none has been successful in interpreting all the observations ( zhang 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "an intriguing hypothesis was proposed by yamazaki ( 2009 ) . according to this hypothesis",
    ", there was already activity from the central engine before the grb itself .",
    "the x - ray flux is already decaying before the grb trigger . due to a bad choice of reference time ( the grb trigger time ) , this power - law - decaying prior emission component ( ejected at a time @xmath1 with respect to the grb trigger time , which we define as @xmath2 ) appears as an artificial broken power law with a plateau stretching out to @xmath3 in the log - log diagram . in order to observe the single power law behavior of the prior emission component , one needs to move the time zero point to @xmath1 , which we define as @xmath4 .",
    "according to kobayashi & zhang ( 2007 ) , the time zero point of external shock emission should coincide with the beginning of the corresponding central engine activity .",
    "so for prior emission it should be at @xmath4 , while for the main grb it should be at @xmath2 as @xmath2 , which marks the start of the prompt emission even though the actual trigger happened later due to an instrumental slewing effect . ] .",
    "the observed x - ray afterglow is dominated by the prior emission component , which outshines the x - ray emission associated with the main grb outflow during the shallow and normal decay phases",
    ". a systematic study of _",
    "swift_/xrt light curves from grbs detected before mid-2009 ( liang et al .",
    "2009 ) suggests that the prior emission model provides a unified interpretation of both the canonical x - ray light curves and the light curves that seem to follow a single power law decay ( which are the ones with negligibly short @xmath0 ) .",
    "in addition , liang et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also found that both types of light curves in their sample can be roughly explained by the external shock model .",
    "if a prior explosion indeed happened , this prior outflow must sweep up the ambient medium and form an external shock .",
    "the long - lasting prior x - ray emission that is invoked to interpret the x - ray plateaus is most likely from this external shock .",
    "if this is the case , then the same external shock would give rise to an optical emission component that follows the same plateau behavior .",
    "this can be tested with the available optical data , especially during the earliest observational epoch . in general ,",
    "optical emission observed during the prompt phase may be a mix of this prior emission component and several other emission components , including the optical counterpart of the prompt grb emission , and the reverse shock and forward shock emission associated with the prompt outflow .",
    "as discussed in ioka et al . ( 2006 ) , the ejecta associated with the prompt emission would stream into the trail of the prior component blastwave with modified medium density profile , leading to another pair of forward and reverse shocks ( for the dynamics setting of the three shock system , see zhang & mszros 2002 ) .",
    "the relative importance of emission contribution to the optical band depends on many parameters .",
    "the reverse shock component can dominate or be outshone by the forward shock component in the optical band . the detected prompt optical emission flux is therefore allowed to be higher than the predicted flux . on the other hand ,",
    "if the prompt optical flux or upper limit is already below the range of the predicted optical flux , then the external shock prior emission model would be ruled out .",
    "this is the motivation and strategy of this paper .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the results of the spectral fits , burst redshifts , extinction information , and the inclusive list of the references for the optical light curve data are given in table 1 .",
    "the xrt light curve fits and spectral regime determinations are given in table 2 .",
    "the xrt light curve data , associated fits , extinction - corrected optical observations , and predicted ranges are shown in figure 3 .",
    "the green bars in the plots have the same meanings as the bars shown in the cartoon spectra in figure 1 and explained in section 3 .",
    "the dashed black lines are the maximum predicted optical light curves from the external shock prior emission model allowed by the data . if the optical data constrain the dashed black line to be below the green range , for self - consistency we instead plot a dashed line corresponding to the minimum optical light curve allowed by the external shock prior emission model , even though it clearly contradicts the data .",
    "the dashed light blue line in the plot for grb 061121 is a fit to its optical light curve data ( discussed in section 4.2 ) .",
    "looking at figure 3 , one can see that the results for each grb are a bit different .",
    "in general , we can assign the bursts to one of two groups : those that are consistent ( or at least , not inconsistent ) with the external shock prior emission hypothesis , and those that are inconsistent with the external shock prior emission hypothesis .",
    "the early optical upper limits of grb 050822 lie within the thick part of the green range , corresponding to the maximum prediction in which @xmath5 .",
    "however , since these data are just upper limits and not actual detections , the actual level of optical flux from this dark burst could lie anywhere in the green range or even below the green range . in fact , since we were unable to correct these upper limits for host galaxy extinction , the limits ( and thus the actual level of optical flux ) could even be above the green range .",
    "regardless , the facts that these are only upper limits , and that even without correction for host galaxy extinction they lie within the green range , lead us to the conclusion that grb 050822 is not inconsistent with the external shock prior emission hypothesis .",
    "grb 060729 has been studied ( e.g. , by grupe et al .",
    "2007 , curran et al . 2009 ) in many optical bands . however , there is no additional _ r_-band data in the literature .",
    "we find the early _ r_-band optical upper limit and detections of grb 060729 , which have been corrected for both galactic and host galaxy extinction , lie within the thinner part of the green range .",
    "this is consistent with the case in which there is one spectral break between the x - ray and optical bands : @xmath6 . due to the lack of additional _",
    "r_-band data , we can not make any further comparisons of this burst to predictions of the external shock prior emission hypothesis , and conclude that the available _",
    "r_-band data for grb 060729 are not inconsistent with this hypothesis .    for grb 060927 ,",
    "the early optical data is at a wavelength near the * _ i_-band * , and fortunately there is additional optical data in this band in the literature .",
    "the prompt * _ i_-band * optical flux density falls within the thicker part of the green predicted range , corresponding to the maximum prediction in which @xmath5 .",
    "it is clear that the overall shape of the optical light curve is not consistent with the smooth , @xmath0-shifted single power law predicted by the external shock prior emission model .",
    "this suggests that , if there is a prior emission external shock optical component , it is dominated by other optical components . the dashed black line shows the maximum prior emission optical light curve allowed by the data .",
    "the results for grb 061222a are similar to those for grb 050822 , except in this case , the early optical upper limits are nearly four orders of magnitude above the green range .",
    "this is explained by the large amount of host galaxy extinction ( nearly 15 magnitudes ) for this burst .",
    "because grb 061222a is a dark burst , we do nt know whether the actual level of optical flux is consistent with the prediction of the external shock prior emission model .",
    "thus , based on the limited data available , we conclude that this burst is not inconsistent with our hypothesis .",
    "overall , the optical data of grb 050822 , grb 060729 , grb 060927 , and grb 061222a are not inconsistent with the hypothesis that the prior emission , if it exists , arises from an external shock .",
    "however , due to the lack of optical light curve data for comparison ( in the cases of grb 050822 , grb 060729 , and grb 061222a ) , or excess optical flux ( in the case of grb 060927 ) , these bursts do not make a strong case for the hypothesis .",
    "in other words , the results for these grbs do not constrain or rule out the external shock prior emission hypothesis .",
    "the early optical detection of grb 050319 falls within the thinner part of the green range .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction in which there is one spectral break between the x - ray and optical bands : @xmath7 .",
    "however , the optical light curve data clearly do not exhibit the smooth , @xmath0-shifted single power law behavior predicted by the external shock prior emission model .",
    "this suggests that , even if the prior emission does originate from an external shock , the optical prior emission component is dominated by other optical components .",
    "thus , the maximum predicted prior emission optical light curve should lie below the actual optical light curve data .",
    "however , plotting the dashed line below all of the optical data would place the predicted prior emission light curve below the green range , which is not self - consistent .",
    "thus , the dashed black line is ultimately constrained by the green range in this case .",
    "we must conclude that grb 050319 is not consistent with the external shock prior emission hypothesis .",
    "the situation is similar for grb 050401 and grb 051109a .",
    "although the early optical detections of these bursts fall within the thinner part of the predicted green range corresponding to @xmath7 , the shapes of the optical light curves are not consistent with the shape predicted by the external shock prior emission model . once again , the predicted prior emission optical light curves are ultimately constrained by the bottom of the green range , and we must conclude that grb 050401 and grb 051109a are not consistent with the external shock prior emission hypothesis .",
    "grb 061121 is the only burst in our sample for which the early optical data fall below the green range .",
    "consequently , the only way to explain this burst within the external shock prior emission model is to introduce the ad hoc assumption that there are two spectral breaks between the x - ray and optical bands ( @xmath8 ) , as indicated by the dash - dotted extension of the green range .",
    "even after making this ad hoc assumption , there are still issues with grb 061121 . at first glance",
    "the shape of the optical light curve appears promisingly similar to that of the x - ray light curve .",
    "this could be consistent with eq .",
    "[ [ x6 ] ] and figure 2 ( given the right set of parameter values ) , considering that @xmath9 for this burst .",
    "however , when we actually fit the optical light curve ( minus the second data point , which we dismissed as an optical flare ) with eq .",
    "[ [ x1 ] ] , the results are not consistent with those of the x - ray light curve fit : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "we then tried fitting the optical data , holding the time - shift parameter fixed at the value from the x - ray light curve fit ( @xmath13 ) , but the results still were inconsistent with those of the x - ray light curve fit : @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( this fit is shown as the dashed light blue line in figure 3 ) .",
    "finally , we tried fitting the optical data with both the time - shift parameter and the decay index fixed at the x - ray values ( @xmath13 , @xmath16 ) , but this yielded an unacceptable @xmath17 . due to the contrived parameter space required to make this burst consistent with the predictions , as well as the decay index of the optical light curve ,",
    "we conclude that grb 061121 is inconsistent with the external shock prior emission hypothesis .    taken together , the optical data of grb 050319 , grb 050401 , grb 051109a , and grb 061121 ( which make up half of our sample ) , severely constrain the external shock prior emission hypothesis .",
    "in order to test whether or not the observations are consistent with the intriguing hypothesis that the observed x - ray afterglow plateaus are due to an external shock prior emission component , we have compared the prompt ( and late , if available ) optical emission data with the predicted ranges based on the model .",
    "we find that in 4 out of 8 grbs , the available optical data already impose severe constraints on the hypothesis .",
    "in particular , the expected optical flux from the prior external shock model is higher than what the data allow .",
    "this suggests that the x - ray emission , if it has a prior emission origin , can not be synchrotron emission from the external shock .",
    "if indeed the shallow - decay x - ray component were from a prior emission component , it would have to be of an internal origin with optical flux suppressed .",
    "future observations before grb triggers would definitely test the prior emission hypothesis .",
    "this might be realized in the svom era ( see e.g. paul et al .",
    "2011 for a discussion of the svom mission and zhang 2011 for a discussion of the prospects of detecting prior emission ) , or perhaps as soon as tomorrow , via serendipitous observations by current observatories .",
