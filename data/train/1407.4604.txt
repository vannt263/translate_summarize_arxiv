    "the interest of precision astrometry in the high frequency regime ( i.e. mm - wavelengths ) is at the heart of the korean vlbi network ( kvn ) design and science case .",
    "the capability to produce `` bona fide '' astrometrically aligned maps of emission at different frequencies provides observational evidence for a wide scope of studies . for agn studies ,",
    "the `` core - shift '' measurements are used as probes of the physical conditions in the innermost regions of agn jets , and to advance the understanding of proposed jet formation mechanisms ; in the galactic domain , for studies of circumstellar envelopes and star forming regions , the relative position of maser emission from different molecular species and transitions serves to test and discriminate between proposed emission mechanisms .    while conventional `` phase referencing '' ( hereafter pr ) @xcite is an established astrometric technique , its scope of application is restricted to the cm - wavelength regime .",
    "in contrast , the `` source frequency phase referencing '' ( hereafter sfpr ) @xcite technique achieves `` bona fide '' high precision very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) astrometric measurements in the frequency domain , even in the high frequency ( mm - wavelength ) range , where conventional pr techniques fail .",
    "the multi - channel receivers at the kvn , which enable simultaneous observations at 22/43/86/129 ghz @xcite , are an ideal configuration for the application of sfpr techniques . while the kvn has been regularly observing as a stand - alone instrument @xcite , and together with other networks @xcite , for mapping purposes , its unique astrometric application is still much less explored .",
    "the aim of this work is to verify the kvn astrometric capability using a comparative study with the nrao very long baseline array ( vlba ) , a well established instrument . for that purpose",
    "we have used vlba sfpr observations of a pair of sources at 22/44 ghz , along with kvn observations using a similar configuration , both carried out in april 2013 .",
    "the vlba observations were carried out using fast frequency switching between both bands , while the kvn used simultaneous dual frequency observations .",
    "this study will serve to deepen the understanding on the limitations imposed by the fast frequency switching observing mode ( i.e. with the vlba ) , and the benefits derived from simultaneous dual frequency simultaneous observations with the multi - channel receivers in the kvn .",
    "the driver for this is to investigate whether to equip global baselines with kvn - like systems or more conventional fast frequency - switching systems .",
    "the interest and basis of the sfpr method have been described in detail in other publications @xcite ; most recently , the application to spectral line observations of h@xmath1o and sio masers in evolved stars , with a non integer frequency ratio , is presented in @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the sfpr technique provides at mm - wavelengths the benefits that conventional pr has in the cm - wavelength regime , where the moderate tropospheric phase fluctuations can be matched with the duty cycle of the telescope switching between the target and reference sources .",
    "nevertheless , at mm and sub - mm wavelengths the faster tropospheric phase fluctuations require faster telescope source switching which , combined with the intrinsically weaker source fluxes , lower telescope sensitivity and scarcity of suitable reference sources , results in a degraded pr calibration , which prevents astrometry in general .    alternatively , in sfpr , the tropospheric calibration is carried out using observations at a lower frequency on the same source , based on its non - dispersive nature , using fast frequency switching ( with the vlba ) or simultaneous dual - frequency observations ( with the kvn ) .",
    "frequency switching antenna operations are faster than source switching , which allows for tracking of the dominant , highly unpredictable , rapid atmospheric fluctuations which ultimately limit the application of pr techniques ; therefore it is expected that simultaneous dual frequency observations will provide the best compensation .",
    "also , having same line - of - sight observations has important implications in the compensation of the residual zenith path length tropospheric errors , which hamper pr . the weaker source fluxes and lower telescope sensitivity constraints are also alleviated with the increased coherence time after tropospheric calibration .    for astrometric applications additional interspaced observations of a reference source are required ( i.e. `` source switching '' ) , although the source does not need to be as close to the target nor as regularly - sampled as for conventional pr .",
    "this compensates the remaining , longer time scale , ionospheric and instrumental ( and in general any dispersive contribution ) phase variations , which are non negligible . switching angles of several degrees and switching - cycles of several minutes are acceptable .",
    "+ a typical sfpr observing run consists of a few minutes - long blocks of dual frequency observations of the target source , either with fast frequency switching , and ideally with simultaneous observations , preceded and followed by similar observations of the reference source .",
    "the outcome of sfpr provides high precision `` bona - fide '' astrometric registration of the brightness distributions at the observed frequencies .",
    "the multi - channel kvn receivers allow : precise astrometric measurements at mm wavelengths , reaching the instrumental thermal noise limit , as a result of the superior tropospheric compensation , ; also high sensitivity observations due to the effective use of the observing time , of interest for weak sources .",
    "the relatively short kvn baselines limit the astrometric accuracy in observations of sources with extended structures , due to structure smearing effects .",
    "this limitation might be solved in the future with longer baselines .",
    "+ in this paper we present a comparative study of the astrometric measurements with vlba and kvn at 22 and 44 ghz to validate the sfpr astrometric outcome with kvn . this dataset is part of a 2-year long series of observations with the vlba whose scientific aim is to gain insight into the problem of the origin of jet wobbling in blazars .",
    "there is still no general paradigm to explain the phenomenon of wobbling , but it is likely that the mechanisms are tied to fundamental properties of the inner regions of the agn because they are triggered in the innermost regions of the jets .",
    "astrometric observations can provide the direct evidence of changes in the absolute position of the innermost region of the jet down to a level of a few tens of @xmath2as . in order to achieve this",
    ", we combine sfpr observations , for a precise registration between the maps at 22 and 44 ghz , and pr observations at 22 ghz to refer these positions to an external reference . in this paper",
    "we focus on the comparative study of astrometric measurements with the two arrays for one epoch of observations .",

    "a discussion of the results and ways to improve outcomes is presented in section 5 .",
    "* vlba observations * : on april 3rd , 2013 , we used 9 vlba antennas for sfpr observations of a pair of sources consisting of a blazar , oj287 , and a quasar , 0854 + 213 , 1.2 degrees away , with `` fast frequency switching '' observations between 22 and 44 ghz , for @xmath3 4.5 hours , over a time span of @xmath3 7.5 hours .",
    "the remaining 3 hours were mainly dedicated to similar observations of another pair of sources , along with occasional few minutes - long conventional pr observations of the same sources , for each pair , at 22 ghz .",
    "the latter aim at , in combination with the sfpr measurements , achieving high precision relative astrometry with respect to an external reference at 44 ghz , and are out of the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere .",

    "we applied standard vlbi hybrid mapping techniques in aips for the analysis of the vlba and kvn observations .",
    "the analysis were carried out independently for each source , and for each frequency , following the same standard procedures .",
    "we used the information on system temperatures , gain curves and telescope gains measured at the individual antennas , to calibrate the raw correlation coefficients .",

    "we used the aips task fring to estimate residual antenna - based phases and phase derivatives ( delay and rate ) at intervals of @xmath11 seconds .",
    "next we applied the corresponding antennas phase , delay and rate solutions to the data sets , and averaged them in time , and over the total observed bandwidth .",
    "then we made hybrid maps of their brightness distributions using a number of iterations of a cycle including the mapping task imagr and phase self - calibration with calib .",
    "+ at 22 ghz , both oj287 and 0854 + 213 had direct detections within the coherence time imposed by tropospheric fluctuations , and could be imaged as described above . at 44 ghz ,",
    "only oj287 had direct detections , while 0854 + 213 is too weak to be detected .",
    "nevertheless , while 0854 + 213 did not have direct detections at 44 ghz , the extended coherence time resulting from the frequency phase transfer calibration strategy using the observations at 22 ghz , followed by hybrid mapping techniques , allowed imaging , for both vlba and kvn datasets .",
    "frequency phase transfer calibration is described in more detail in the following section .",
    "the hybrid maps are presented in section 4 .",
    "the sfpr analysis technique preserves the relative phase information between observations at two frequency bands and enables astrometry in the frequency domain .",
    "its implementation in the analysis consists of two steps , to eliminate non - dispersive and dispersive errors , respectively .",
    "the first step uses the antenna - based residual terms ( phase , delay and rates ) derived from the self - calibration analysis ( i.e. with task fring ) of the data at the lower reference frequency ( @xmath12 , here 22 ghz ) , to calibrate the same - source data at the higher target frequency ( @xmath13 , here 44 ghz ) , after scaling the phase values by the frequency ratio ; this is done for each of the two sources .",
    "the use of the aips task sncor to scale the phase observables does not handle the situation optimally if there are multiple ifs per band .",
    "although this might be reversed with the second fring self - calibration run ( only for the reference source ) at the higher frequency for continuum observations in general , it will be an issue for spectral line analysis .",
    "instead we used an external program written for this purpose , ",
    "use_only_mb.pl \" , to scale the phase values in the sn table before being applied to the higher frequency .",
    "this first step we call frequency phase transfer ( fpt ) .    in order to avoid contamination of source structure effects in the calibration process",
    ", the corresponding hybrid maps are fed into the phase self - calibration process for both sources at 22 ghz , and for the reference source at 44 ghz .",
    "a more detailed description of the effects of the source structure in the analysis is presented in section 3.3 .",
    "the fpt calibrated visibility phases at the target frequency ( 44 ghz ) should be largely free of all non - dispersive error contributions ( i.e. the effects of unmodelled perturbations introduced by errors in the geometric and tropospheric parameters in the `` a priori '' correlator models ) . fpt analysis with vlba observations requires temporal interpolation between consecutive scans at 22 ghz , to the interleaving scan at 44 ghz , all on the same source .",
    "this is done independently for both sources .",
    "it works under the assumption that the duty cycle of frequency switching is shorter than the coherence time imposed by the fast tropospheric fluctuations .",
    "we used a frequency switching duty cycle equal to @xmath14 minute , which is a typical value for the frequencies in this paper ; observations with bad weather and/or at higher frequencies would require faster switching , which restricts the application to stronger sources . note that this is not an issue with simultaneous dual - frequency observations .",
    "+ moreover , the residual rates should be kept under a certain limit to avoid phase ambiguity problems during the temporal interpolation .",
    "this limit corresponds to a phase change of @xmath15 at the lower frequency , during the duty cycle of frequency switching ; in our case we estimate a limit of 4 mhz at 22 ghz for 1-minute duty cycle observations at 22/44 ghz .",
    "if larger rates are present , as it was the case in the vlba observations , correction of the data is required before the analysis .",
    "for example , we manually corrected constant instrumental residual rates equal to 30 and 4 mhz in the correlated data for two stations , mk and ov , respectively , with clcor ( parameter opcode cloc ; and clcorprm ( 1 ) ) .",
    "the residual rates for the rest of stations were much smaller .",
    "note that , in general , the rate threshold will decrease with increasing values of @xmath13 .",
    "this is not an issue with simultaneous dual frequency observations with kvn , which makes the procedure simpler and reduces the impact of errors .",
    "[ fig : oj287fptphs ] showes the fpt visibility phases for oj287 and 0854 + 213 from vlba observations , at 44 ghz .",
    "the alignment of the phases is superior for the oj287 dataset as a result of a much higher signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) ; while the observations of 0854 + 213 are more noisy , the phases appear aligned and following the same trend as for oj287 .",
    "it should be noted again here the absence of detections on the observations of 0854 + 213 at 44 ghz using direct self - calibration analysis , while the fpt analysis enables longer integration times , as seen in the smooth trend of phases , and allows hybrid mapping .",
    "the loss of coherence on the longest baselines to sc and mk stations is significantly larger than for shorter baselines and these have been excluded from the analysis .",
    "the same applies to the start of the observations with lower elevations .",
    "nevertheless this effect does not appear for the self - calibrated dataset .",
    "while such a degradation in the coherence could be explained as a consequence of larger phase errors due to lower correlated amplitudes , this is unlikely as the self - calibrated dataset is unaffected ; we believe it is due to the higher rates , which increase the impact of errors from the temporal interpolation required in `` fast frequency switching '' observations .",
    "the latter contribution is not an issue with simultaneous dual frequency observations .",
    "[ fig : kvnfptphs ] shows the fpt visibility phases for oj287 and 0854 + 213 , at 44 ghz , for observations with the kvn .",
    "the long term temporal sequence of fpt phases is less smooth , compared with the vlba dataset shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : oj287fptphs ] .",
    "the phase jumps that occur in the kvn visibility phases are related to changes in the observing mode in the schedule .",
    "namely , changes between simultaneous dual frequency observations at 22/44 ghz , to single frequency observations for conventional pr .",
    "the system does not return to the identical phase state after this change .",
    "nevertheless , these offsets are common for both sources and hence are compensated automatically in the second step of the sfpr analysis .        for vlba observations ,",
    "the scatter of fpt phases is about twice as large than for the self calibrated phases at 44 ghz , for oj287 . instead , for the kvn",
    ", the scatter of fpt phases is similar to that for the self calibrated phases at 44 ghz .",
    "this is indicative of the superior quality of atmospheric compensation using simultaneous dual frequency , compared to fast frequency switching , observations .",
    "the second step of calibration aims at eliminating the remaining unwanted dispersive errors after fpt calibration .",
    "it resembles the conventional pr technique in the sense that it involves the observations of a second source . in practice",
    "it uses the antenna - based residual terms derived from the ( self - calibration ) analysis of the `` reference '' source ( oj287 ) at 44 ghz , after fpt calibration , to correct the fpt dataset from the other `` target '' source ( 0854 + 213 ) at the same frequency .",
    "this works under the assumption that the angular separation between the sources is smaller than the ionospheric isoplanatic patch size ( i.e. the unmodelled effects introduced by the ionospheric propagation on the observed phases of both sources are not very different , under 1 radian ) and that they are observed with a duty cycle less than the temporal structure of ionospheric variations ; also that any instrumental terms are common for the observations of the two sources .",
    "the outcome are the so - called sfpr visibility phases and are the end product of the calibration process .",
    "the resultant sfpr calibrated phases of 0854 + 213 at 44 ghz should be free from the dispersive and non - dispersive errors mentioned above , but still retain the desired signature of the frequency dependent position .",
    "note that in order to preserve this astrometric signature no self - calibration analysis has been carried out on the observations of 0854 + 213 at 44 ghz .",
    "[ fig:0854sfprphs ] shows the sfpr visibility phases of 0854 + 213 , at 44 ghz , from the analysis of vlba observations .",

    "the fourier transformation of the sfpr calibrated visibility functions produces a sfpr - map .",
    "the offset of the brightness distribution from the centre of this map is astrometrically significant ; it is a measurement of the relative ( or combined)``core - shift '' , between 22 and 44 ghz , for the two sources .",
    "the sfpr maps and astrometric measurements are presented in section 4 .",
    ".,scaledwidth=70.0% ]      in astrometric studies of extended radio sources their structural phase contribution needs to be accounted for .",
    "if uncorrected , this contribution will propagate into astrometric errors . in the analysis of conventional pr observations with aips , this is usually implemented by providing the map of the reference source as an input for the self calibration algorithm ( i.e. fring ) .",
    "this insures that the estimated antenna - based solutions transfered to the target source are free of structure effects from the reference source .",
    "then , the offset of the peak of brightness in the pr map with respect to the origin of the map , is an astrometric measurement of the angular separation between the two sources ; namely , between this peak component and the component at the centre of the reference source map .",
    "these components are therefore called `` reference points '' .",
    "the same situation applies to the sfpr analysis .",
    "the selection of reference points is arbitrary , however , for studies involving multi epoch or multi frequency observations it is essential to select reference points that can be identified across all maps .",
    "failure to identify the same reference points in maps at different epochs or at different frequencies will lead to erroneous measurements of the proper motions or core - shifts , respectively .",
    "+ this is not always easy , even for the comparison of observations with the same resolution at different epochs . structural changes below the resolution limit would be blended together and are equivalent to shifting the reference points for the astrometric analysis , hence the astrometric results would also be shifted . furthermore , when comparing observations with different resolutions , i.e. observations at different frequencies with the same array , or observations from different arrays , systematic errors arising from differential structure blending effects require special consideration .    in particular , for the case study of this paper , the much lower resolution of the kvn will result in blending of the structure features visible in the high resolution vlba maps into a single unresolved component . in order to investigate the incidence of source structure effects in kvn observations we have carried out parallel analysis , using compact source models ( labelled _ kvn i _ ) and using the high resolution maps from the nearly contemporaneous vlba observations ( labelled _ kvn ii , kvn iii _ ) .",
    "for _ kvn ii ) _ , the vlba hybrid maps of oj287 and 0854 + 213 at 22 ghz have been used as inputs in aips task `` fring '' , for self - calibration of kvn observations of each source , at 22 ghz .",
    "then the vlba hybrid map of oj287 at 44 ghz is fed into the fring run on the oj287 fpt dataset at 44 ghz for final sfpr calibration of 0854 + 213 at the same frequency .",
    "while the previous steps serve to identify common reference points in those 3 maps for the kvn and vlba analysis , the position of the peak of the sfpr map generated with aips task `` imagr '' is still affected by the centroid shift due to convolution with the kvn resolution . in order to address this final point , in _ kvn iii ) _ analysis , we have used the aips task `` uvsub '' ( opcode `` div '' ) and the vlba hybrid map of 0854 + 213 at 44 ghz to remove the structure contribution from the sfpr visibility data prior to fourier inversion with `` imagr '' .",

    "below we provide a description of the various contributions based on the analysis in @xcite and @xcite : + * angular resolution and snr * : the spatial resolution and sensitivity of the observations are fundamental to considerations of the position error in the identification of reference points in the maps .",
    "a standard calculation @xcite of the corresponding astrometric error is given by : @xmath18p = @xmath19/snr , where @xmath19 is the angular resolution of the observations , and snr stands for the ratio between the peak of brightness in the map and the noise level in a region away from the meaningful source structure .",
    "we refer to this type of contribution as `` thermal errors '' .",
    "the vlba resolution at 44 ghz is 730 @xmath7 250@xmath20as at pa = @xmath21 after excluding sc and mk antennas , which had very noisy phases in the sfpr analysis ; the kvn resolution is 3.1 @xmath7 1.6 mas at pa=@xmath15 .",
    "therefore , based only on the spatial resolution , the thermal ( random ) errors in the kvn astrometric measurements are about four times larger than for the vlba .",
    "the expected values for the noise @xmath22 in the sfpred maps generated with vlba and kvn are comparable ( within 10% , with lower noise for vlba ) , following from the formula @xcite : + @xmath23$]jy / beam + where @xmath24 or `` system equivalent flux density '' is the system noise expressed in janskys , @xmath25 is the efficiency related to data recording , @xmath26 is the number of antennas , @xmath27 is the recorded bandwidth in hz and @xmath28 is the total integration time on - source in seconds .",
    "the number of antennas is 7 for vlba , and 3 for kvn , observations ; the bandwidth is the same for both arrays ; the @xmath24 is a factor @xmath29 higher for kvn , and the on - source time is a factor @xmath30 longer for kvn , with respect to vlba .",
    "therefore , for example , given a snr=50 , the estimated `` thermal errors '' are @xmath31as for the vlba , and @xmath32as for the kvn .    * semi - random small scale tropospheric errors * : the estimated residual tropospheric phase _ rms _ errors from uncompensated fast tropospheric fluctuations in observations with the vlba , using `` fast frequency switching '' between 22/44 ghz with a duty cycle of 60 seconds , range from @xmath33 for good weather , to @xmath34 for poor weather conditions @xcite . for comparison , simultaneous dual frequency observations with kvn result in no tropospheric errors as",
    "the duty cycle is in effect zero .",
    "the effect of random errors in the vlba analysis are expected to decrease the peak flux value , while increasing the level of noise , in the sfpr map .",
    "nevertheless , while this will affect the snr in the map , they should not affect the astrometric results on a significant level @xcite .",
    "* systematic large scale tropospheric errors * : the systematic tropospheric delay errors arising from uncertainties in the `` a priori '' estimates of the tropospheric zenith delay are a major contribution to astrometric errors in conventional pr observations .",
    "these are compensated in sfpr observations because of the same line - of - sight ( i.e. same source ) observations at the two frequencies .",

    "this highlights the importance that structure blending effects will have in astrometric studies with the kvn , and provides a way for estimating their magnitude , providing high resolution images are available . also , it can serve as a guideline for estimating plausible systematic error contributions that need to be taken into account in the error analysis when no contemporary high resolution images are available . along the same lines we interpret the residual north - south discrepancy in the astrometric measurements as a consequence of imperfect structure compensation in kvn observables using the vlba maps . this",
    "is based on the alignment between the astrometric discrepancy and the structure in the super - resolved image of oj287 at 44 ghz ( see fig .  [",

    "the offset could be either due to structural changes undergone in one or both of the sources in the few days between the vlba and kvn observations , or due to the differences in the structure spatial frequencies sampled by both arrays .",
    "it could also be a combination of these effects .",
    "there is no overlap between the kvn _ uv_-sampling and the vlba _ uv_-sampling , hence it is possible that there may be large scale structure that the kvn responds to , which is filtered out in the vlba observations . in order to eliminate the possibility of kvn - specific effects as the reason for the discrepancy between the astrometric measurements",
    ", we carried out another comparative analysis on datasets with similar resolutions from both arrays ( label _ vlba short iii _ ) .",
    "this type of analysis minimizes the impact of systematic effects arising from different resolutions and allows a direct comparative study .",
    "the new astrometric solution for the short - baseline vlba subset ( with a beamwidth 30% smaller than for the kvn ) is shifted northwards with respect to that from the full vlba dataset , in the direction of the kvn astrometric result .",
    "the low resolution measurements with kvn and vlba agree within 1-@xmath0 of the purely thermal noise error estimate .",
    "this proves that low resolution - related effects are responsible for the residual discrepancy between kvn and full vlba datasets , and not any kvn - specific issues .",
    "therefore we conclude that our comparative study verifies the astrometric performance of kvn observations using sfpr technique at 22/44 ghz , and validates the use of kvn observations for astrometric studies .    both observing strategies , fast frequency switching and simultaneous dual frequency observations , had a good performance for tropospheric compensation at 22/44 ghz , with flux recoveries of 88% and 94% for the vlba and kvn sfpr maps of 0854 + 213 , respectively .",
    "nevertheless it is worth emphasizing aspects of the analysis which high - light the advantages of simultaneous observations .",
    "the scatter of the fpt visibility phases ( i.e. calibrated with solutions at 22 ghz ) and the self - calibrated phases are similar for kvn observations of oj287 at 44 ghz ; for vlba , the scatter of fpt phases are a factor @xmath46 larger .",
    "this is indicative of the simultaneous observations providing a superior compensation of the tropospheric fluctuations in the observables compared to fast frequency switching .",
    "although a rigorous comparison would require identical weather conditions for both arrays when following the different observing strategies , this result is compatible with the expected degradation of the tropospheric calibration introduced by the temporal interpolation required in fast frequency switching observations with a 1-minute duty cycle .",
    "also , it is noticeable that there is an increasing degradation of the quality of phase referencing with longer vlba baselines . while this trend could be expected from the lower snr due to resolving the source , it is aggravated by the increasingly large phase rates on these baselines .",
    "the frequency switching strategy places restrictive limits on the maximum rates which can be allowed , to avoid ambiguity problems in the interpolation ; this is not an issue for simultaneous observations . another important benefit of simultaneous observations is the increase of effective `` on - source '' time . for example , the kvn `` on - source '' time is a factor @xmath47 longer than the vlba `` on - source '' time , for a given interval of observing , for the observations presented in this paper .",
    "this corresponds to an increase in the sensitivity by a factor @xmath48 , and will have an impact in the noise in the sfpr map , the minimum flux of detectable sources and , ultimately , in the astrometric uncertainties .",
    "our experience from the data analysis is that the simultaneous observations using the multi - channel receivers at the kvn is significantly more robust , removes the propagation of errors resulting from the temporal interpolation and can be expected to make a difference in the application to long baselines .",
    "the significance of these benefits is expected to increase for observations at higher frequencies . in general , the success of the sfpr technique is critically dependent on the frequency switching cycle between the two observing frequencies , with faster rates required at higher frequencies .",
    "this sets a practical upper limit on the frequencies that can be used with a frequency switching strategy ; for a cycle time of one minute this will be around 86 ghz .",
    "our previous sfpr observations with vlba at 43 and 86 ghz @xcite using `` fast frequency switching '' suffered significantly from uncompensated tropospheric residuals ; we expect this would be alleviated with simultaneous dual frequency observations .",
    "recent observations with kvn at four frequency bands 22/43/86/129 ghz will allow us to investigate this at the highest vlbi frequencies , where we expect that having simultaneous multi - frequency observations will be mandatory .",
    "therefore we conclude that there are significant benefits from using simultaneous frequency observations for wider astrometric application : simultaneous frequency sfpr will work at higher frequencies , with weaker sources , and under a wider range of weather conditions .",
    "the multi - channel receivers installed at kvn antennas provide an optimum compensation of tropospheric fluctuations and hence have the potential for very high precision astrometric measurements using sfpr techniques .",
    "kvn can reach accurate and precise astrometric measurements to a level of a few tens of @xmath2as in observations of compact sources . on the other hand ,",
    "the limited mapping capability of kvn with 3 antennas and the relatively short baselines lead to a degradation of the astrometric accuracy in observations of extended sources .",
    "these are dominated by systematic structure blending effects . a way to improve",
    "the overall situation is to increase the number of observing antennas and the baseline lengths .",
    "for example a global network of antennas with the capability of simultaneous dual frequency observations similar to those of the kvn , carrying out sfpr observations at 129 ghz , would have a resolution of @xmath49as and would reach astrometric precisions of a few @xmath2as .",
    "these unprecedented levels of precision match the requirements for investigation of the innermost regions of agn jets , closer to the black hole , in exquisite detail .",
    "moreover , the extra sensitivity gained from the increased coherence time after compensation of tropospheric phase fluctuations would turn it into an ultra sensitive high precision astrometric instrument .",
    "therefore global observations with kvn - like antennas opens the possibility to tackle new fields of science , for example studies of the shadows of black holes .",
    "these have been hitherto reserved for the next generation of instruments planned for the next decade , such as vlbi with alma , the event horizon telescope @xcite and space vlbi @xcite missions .",
    "the vlba observations presented in this paper are part of a long series to investigate the nature of the jet wobbling effect in oj287 , by monitoring the changes in the position of its core @xcite at 44 ghz . at each epoch , this position is measured , with respect to an external reference , by combining the measurements from conventional pr at 22 ghz , and sfpr at 22/44 ghz . in this paper we present the maps ( with nominal resolution and super - resolved ) and sfpr astrometric measurements for one epoch of observations .",
    "the splitting of the super - resolved structure of oj287 at 44 ghz into two components along a direction which is nearly perpendicular to the jet direction in the map at 22 ghz deserves special mention ( see figs .  [",

    "therefore we conclude that the `` core '' component in the map of oj287 at 22 ghz is located in - between the two components seen in the super - resolved map at 44 ghz , namely at a separation of @xmath50as in the se direction of the component at the center of the map in the super resolution map",

    "<S> the korean vlbi network ( kvn ) is a new mm - vlbi dedicated array with capability for simultaneous observations at multiple frequencies , up to 129 ghz . </S>",

    "<S> the aim of this work is to verify the astrometric performance of the kvn using a comparative study with the vlba , a well established instrument . for that purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we carried out nearly contemporaneous observations with the kvn and the vlba , at 14/7 mm , in april 2013 . </S>",
    "<S> the kvn observations consisted of simultaneous dual frequency observations , while the vlba used fast frequency switching observations . </S>",
    "<S> we used the source frequency phase referencing technique for the observational and analysis strategy . </S>",
    "<S> we find that having simultaneous observations results in a superior performance for compensation of all atmospheric terms in the observables , in addition to offering other significant benefits for astrometric analysis . we have compared the kvn astrometry measurements to those from the vlba . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the structure blending effects introduce dominant systematic astrometric shifts and these need to be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested multiple analytical routes to characterize the impact of the low resolution effects for extended sources in the astrometric measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the results from the analysis of kvn and full vlba datasets agree within 2-@xmath0 of the thermal error estimate . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the discrepancy as arising from the different resolutions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the kvn provides astrometric results with excellent agreement , within 1-@xmath0 , when compared to a vlba configuration which has a similar resolution . </S>",
    "<S> therefore this comparative study verifies the astrometric performance of kvn using sfpr at 14/7 mm , and validates the kvn as an astrometric instrument . </S>"
