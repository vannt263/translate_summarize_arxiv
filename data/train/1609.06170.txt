    "coherent structures emergent from small scale turbulence are often observed in planetary atmospheres with the zonal jets of the gaseous planets being familiar examples @xcite .",
    "while this phenomenon of spontaneous large scale jet organization from small scale turbulence has been extensively investigated in both observational and theoretical studies @xcite the physical mechanism underlying it remains controversial .",
    "the prominence of jets in planetary turbulence is in part due to the jet being a nonlinear stationary solution of the dynamics in the limit of vanishing dissipation and therefore not disrupted by nonlinear advective processes .",
    "however , this observation is insufficient by itself to serve as an explanation for the observed jets for three reasons .",
    "first , strong jets typically assume a characteristic structure for a given set of system parameters , while any zonally symmetric flow is a fixed point of the inviscid dynamics .",
    "second , nonlinear stationary states lack a mechanism of maintenance against dissipation and so can not explain the fact that the observed jets , which are not maintained by coherent external forcing such as by an imposed pressure gradient , persist much longer than the dissipation time scale .",
    "third , planetary jets commonly appear to be unstable ; for example , the north polar jet ( npj ) of saturn robustly satisfies rayleigh s necessary condition for barotropic instability in a dissipationless stationary flow @xcite , and the barotropic instability of this jet has been verified by eigenanalysis @xcite .",
    "the aforementioned considerations imply that a comprehensive theory for the existence of large scale jets in the atmospheres of the gaseous planets and in particular saturn s npj must provide a mechanism for the formation and maintenance of the jet from incoherent turbulence , the particular structure assumed by the jet and its stability .",
    "in addition to these the case of the npj also requires that the theory account for the prominent coherent wave six structure that distorts the jet into a distinct hexagonal form .",
    "the primary mechanism by which jets are maintained in turbulent flow is upgradient perturbation momentum flux resulting from straining of the perturbation field by the mean jet shear which implies a spectrally nonlocal interaction between the small - scale perturbation field and the large - scale jet .",
    "this mechanism has been verified in observational studies of both jovian and saturnian atmospheres  @xcite , as well as in numerical simulations  @xcite and in laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "this upgradient momentum transfer mechanism has been found to maintain mean jets both in barotropic forced dissipative models @xcite and in baroclinic free turbulence models @xcite .",
    "excitation of the observed small scale forced turbulence has been traced to convection in the case of both the jovian and saturnian jets @xcite .    in this work saturn s npj",
    "is studied using an implementation of statistical state dynamics ( ssd ) , specifically a closure at second order in a cumulant expansion ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) referred to as the stochastic structural stability theory ( s3 t ) system @xcite . in s3 t",
    "the nonlinear terms in the perturbation equation are parameterized by a stochastic excitation rather than being explicitly calculated while the nonlinear interaction of the perturbations with the mean jet are fully retained .",
    "for this reason the s3 t system may be described as a quasi - linear ( ql ) model .",
    "s3 t has been applied previously to the problem of jet formation in barotropic turbulence @xcite and to jet dynamics in baroclinic turbulence @xcite .",
    "the s3 t system employs an equivalently infinite ensemble in the dynamical equation for the second cumulant and as a result provides an autonomous and fluctuation - free dynamics for the statistical mean turbulent state which greatly facilitates analytic study .    when applying s3 t to the study of zonal jets it is appropriate to equate the ensemble mean to the zonal mean by appeal to the ergodic hypothesis .",
    "a two - layer model is employed in order to provide the possibility for baroclinic and barotropic dynamics both for the jet itself and for the perturbations that are involved in the equilibration dynamics .",
    "one reason this is important is because a barotropic or shallow water model with the observed rossby radius would not allow the problem freedom to adopt barotropic dynamics . in the event",
    "we find that the dynamics is nearly barotropic so that the rossby radius is not a relevant parameter .",
    "we find that jet formation is tightly controlled by the effective vorticity gradient , @xmath0 .",
    "as this is a robust requirement of the dynamics , the observed jet structure is taken as an indirect observation of this parameter .",
    "saturn s npj is similar in structure and amplitude to midlatitude jets on the gaseous planets such as jupiter s @xmath1",
    "n jet while the planetary value of @xmath2 at the latitude of the npj is too weak to stabilize a jet with the observed amplitude , @xmath3 which poses an oft remarked dynamical dilemma @xcite .",
    "theory and observation can be brought into correspondence by inferring a deep strongly statically stable layer beneath the jet giving rise to the equivalent of a topographic @xmath0 effect .",
    "the @xmath0 used in the model is then taken to correspond to the contribution to the overall @xmath0 effect of the planetary and the topographic components of @xmath0 . with this",
    "inferred effective @xmath0 the observed jet structure accords with the theory .",
    "while the first cumulant provides the structure of the jet , the second determines the planetary scale wave disturbance superposed on the jet . with the inferred value of @xmath0 and an incoherent turbulence excitation level consistent with observation this wave",
    "is found to have wavenumber six and the amplitude required to produce the observed hexagonal shape of the npj .",
    "the role of this wave in the dynamics is to equilibrate the jet with the observed velocity structure and amplitude .",
    "the nonlinear s3 t equilibrium obtained satisfies rayleigh s necessary condition for instability in both the prograde and retrograde jet and significant interaction between the jet and the incipient instabilities associated with both these vorticity gradient structures is seen .",
    "the widely debated enigma of the stability of the npj in the face of these strong vorticity gradient sign reversals is resolved by their having been adjusted to ( in most cases marginal ) stability by the perturbation / mean flow interaction between the first and second cumulants of the s3 t dynamics .",
    "the simplest model that retains the freedom for the dynamics to exploit both baroclinic and barotropic processes is the quasi - geostrophic two - layer model .",
    "we choose parameters appropriate for the npj of saturn including planetary vorticity gradient @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the planetary vorticity and the derivative is taken at the center of the channel at @xmath6 .",
    "the channel size is @xmath7 in the zonal , @xmath8 , direction , and @xmath9 in the meridional direction , @xmath10 , in which @xmath11 is the radius of the planet and @xmath12 is the latitude .",

    "the coefficient of linear damping is @xmath40 and this damping may vary with the scale of the motions when appropriate for probing the dynamics controlling jet formation and equilibration . in particular insight can be gained by examining the regime in which the large scale zonal flow is damped at a rate @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the damping rate of the perturbations .",
    "the barotropic and baroclinic streamfunctions are decomposed into a zonal mean ( denoted with capitals ) and deviations from the zonal mean ( referred to as perturbations and denoted with primed small letters ) : @xmath43 we denote the barotropic zonal mean flow as @xmath44 and the baroclinic zonal mean flow as @xmath45 .",
    "equations for the evolution of the barotropic and baroclinic zonal mean flows are obtained by formimg the zonal mean of :    [ eq : nl_mbrcl ] @xmath46    in which the overline denotes zonal averaging , @xmath47 and @xmath48 denotes the linear damping rate of the mean flow .",
    "the terms @xmath49 and @xmath50 , with @xmath51 , are respectively the reynolds stress divergence forcing of the barotropic and baroclinic mean flow or equivalently the barotropic and baroclinic vorticity flux .",
    "vorticity fluxes are referred to as upgradient if they have the tendency to reinforce the mean flow so that e.g. @xmath52 , otherwise they are termed downgradient .",

    "simulations including baroclinic influences arising from temperature gradients below the threshold required for baroclinic instability , as is appropriate for saturn , show small changes in the results .",

    "we find that a barotropic jet with a single maximum in zonal velocity arises as an unstable s3 t eigenmode .",

    "the effective value of @xmath0 required to obtain correspondence with the scaling is @xmath129    as we will show , the mechanism underlying establishment of these equilibria is associated with sign change of the vorticity gradient in the retrograde jet , which is accompanied by the appearance of a mode .",
    "the jet equilibrium is established by a robust feedback regulation arising from interaction between the mean equation and the perturbation covariance equation associated with the appearance of this mode and its strong downgradient momentum flux .",
    "the mean jet , which is undamped , grows from an arbitrarily small perturbation in the mean flow at first exponentially under the influence of the upgradient fluxes induced by shear straining of the short waves .",
    "this growth is abruptly terminated by downgradient fluxes associated with the arising of this highly non - normal nearly neutral mode as the jet vorticity gradient sign change begins to be established ( cf .",
    "[ fig : vq ] ) .",
    "extensive experimentation has convinced us that this incipient instability closely constrains the jet amplitude to allow only relatively small vorticity gradient sign changes to occur . because close regulation of the mean flow by fluxes arising in association with incipient instabilities is so robust it is widely recognized that the large magnitude of the vorticity gradient sign change in the npj observations poses a conundrum @xcite . within our model framework",
    "this discrepancy between the observed large vorticity gradient sign change in the observations of the upper layer of the npj can only be resolved by regarding the observed jet equilibrium as an indirect observation of a larger effective value of @xmath0 in the unobserved lower layer of the npj and in fact the s3 t equilibrium jet with an appropriate choice of @xmath0 , which is @xmath129 , is in close agreement with the observed npj jet ( cf .",
    "[ fig : unorm]b ) .",
    "we wish now to establish the dynamical argument compelling this conclusion .",
    "we turn now to study in more detail the mechanism underlying the universal scaling of the structure and amplitude of weakly damped turbulent jets .    note that in an undamped jet at equilibrium the perturbation momentum flux divergence vanishes at each latitude , @xmath130 ( cf .",

    "a temporal sequence showing establishment of the equilibrium structure of the npj starting from a random initial condition and assuming the inferred @xmath133 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vq ] .",
    "as is generally found , the upgradient fluxes are produced by the short waves @xcite , which in the case of the npj means waves with @xmath134 .",
    "conversely , downgradient fluxes are produced by the long waves with @xmath135 .",
    "the upgradient fluxes are associated with shear straining of the short waves which is a universal mechanism resulting in a negative viscosity in that it produces upgradient momentum flux proportional to the velocity gradient @xcite as is observed in the atmospheres of both jupiter and saturn @xcite .",
    "this shear straining mechanism accelerates both the prograde and retrograde jets .",
    "when the homogeneous turbulence is perturbed by a random mean jet these upgradient fluxes immediately cause the jet to grow in the form of the most unstable s3 t eigenmode ( cf .",

    "progressively exceeds the speed of the slower retrograde rossby modes and these sequentially obtain critical layers inside the retrograde jet @xcite .",
    "approach to and attainment of a critical layer by these modes is accompanied by increasing modal as well as non - normal energetic interaction with the jet which produces increasing downgradient fluxes opposing the growth of the s3 t jet eigenmode so as to eventually establish a nonlinear equilibrium . as neutral stability",
    "is approached with increasing jet amplitude these fluxes come into balance establishing by time @xmath131 the stable fixed point equilibrium turbulent jet structure and associated perturbation covariance that together constitute a complete solution for the turbulent state at second order as shown in fig .",

    "the eigenvalues reveal the approach of the retrograde modes phase speeds to the speed of the retrograde jet and the associated decrease in mode damping rate which is indicative of energetic interaction with the jet and diagnostic of downgradient momentum flux by the mode .",
    "the resolvent of @xmath137 provides more information by revealing the response of the dynamics to the turbulent excitation at each mode phase speed , @xmath139 .",
    "the resolvent is obtained by solving the fourier transform of the dynamics ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath140 in which @xmath73 is the identity matrix .",
    "the square norm of the resolvent of @xmath137 , which is the energy spectrum as a function of phase speed for temporally and spatially delta correlated excitation , is shown together with the spectrum of the modes of @xmath137 for the equilibrium jet structure , @xmath138 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolvent ] .",
    "there is a dominant nearly neutral rossby mode with wavenumber six that is responsible for most of the downgradient momentum flux balancing the upgradient shear straining fluxes from the short waves ( cf .",
    "[ fig : vq ] at @xmath131 ) .",
    "this wave dominates the response of the dynamics to perturbation when the jet is equilibrated as can be inferred from the resolvent .",
    "this dominance of wavenumber six in the perturbation variance extends over a wide range in @xmath0 and therefore in equilibrium jet amplitude as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltau ] .",
    "note that the phase speed of this mode has been incorporated into the retrograde jet but that this mode remains stable consistent with finiteness of the perturbation variance .",
    "the strong @xmath141 fluxes associated with the maintenance of this mode have forced the gradient of the mean vorticity in the vicinity of its critical layer nearly to zero as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : qy6 ] .",
    "this nonlinear interaction provides an example of the mechanisms at play in the complex feedback stabilization process operating between the first and second cumulants in the s3 t dynamics that results in establishment of the equilibrium statistical state .",
    "it is useful to regard this interaction as a nonlinear regulator that continuously adjusts the mean flow to a state that is in neutral equilibrium with the perturbation dynamics by enforcing vanishing of the mean vorticity gradient at the critical layers of the dominant perturbation modes in the retrograde jet .",
    "this consideration explains why strongly excited jet equilibria in planetary atmospheres commonly exhibit easily obervable changes in sign of the mean vorticity gradient without incurring instability : shear straining of the small turbulence components drives both the prograde and retrograde jets strongly producing the sign change while the regulator need only equilibrate any incipient modal instability by enforcing vanishing of the gradient at the mode critical layer while leaving a substantial vorticity sign change between the critical layers in the jet profile .",
    "it is important to appreciate the crucial role of active feedback regulation continually operating between the first and second cumulants in the ssd in maintaining the stability of this turbulent equilibrium jet / wave / turbulence state .",
    "if one were simply to postulate a jet profile very much like the observed it would be extremely unlikely to have by chance the vanishing gradient of vorticity precisely at the critical layers of the mode required for stability of the jet structure .",
    "viewed another way , the existence of strong jet equilibria with the structure seen in planetary atmospheres requires that an active feedback regulation be operating to maintain their stability .",
    "note that the mechanism of vorticity mixing in the retrograde jets could not result in a negative vorticity maximum as is seen in both observations and our simulations .    while it is tempting to regard the downgradient momentum fluxes arising from the dominant mode itself as being primarily responsible for opposing the upgradient fluxes by the small waves , the resolvent tells a different story .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolvent ] is both the response of the jet dynamics to perturbation as a function of phase speed and the response that would be produced by the modes assuming they were independent ; that is , assuming the modes to be orthogonal in energy .",
    "this so called equivalent normal response reveals that the energetics and therefore the fluxes associated with the ldm at @xmath142 are being produced by non - normal interaction among the modes rather than by the @xmath142 mode by itself .",
    "in fact it is generally the case in non - normal systems that transient growth of the adjoint of a mode is responsible for establishing a mode s equilibrium amplitude when it is excited stochastically rather than growth of the mode itself @xcite .    because of its dominance",
    "the structure of the @xmath142 perturbation can be obtained as the first eigenmode of the perturbation covariance ( referred to variously as the leading proper orthogonal decomposition ( pod ) or empirical orthogonal function ( eof ) mode ) .",
    "this structure is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vpolar]b and its superposition on the jet with amplitude obtained as the rms of its variance as obtained from the associated pod eigenmode is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vpolar]a .",
    "consistent with the resolvent diagnostic discussed above , this mode has nearly the same structure as the least damped mode of the linear perturbation dynamics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vpolar]c , d , and both have barotropic structure .",
    "the amplitude of the wave six mode is proportional to @xmath132 and we have chosen physically defensible values for these parameters @xmath98 and @xmath143 corresponding to excitation of @xmath144 .",
    "however , other combinations of @xmath35 and @xmath42 with @xmath145 lead to equilibria very close to those obtained with these parameter values .",
    "our study of the dynamical consequences for jet formation and equilibration of varying the planetary value of @xmath0 reported above has the advantage of allowing the underlying mechanisms and the associated scaling to be understood in a simple context .",
    "however , the physical mechanism by which an effective value of @xmath0 differing from the planetary value enters the dynamics of the npj is likely to be a poleward sloping surface of concentrated downward increase in static stability underlying the deep jet which would induce the dynamic analogue of a topographic @xmath0 effect in the lower layer .",
    "this equivalent sloping lower boundary could be associated with constitutive , convective and/or dynamical processes analogous to those which are responsible for maintaining the earth s tropopause but lacking observation it is not possible to identify the specific processes responsible .    a topographic @xmath0 effect results in different values of effective @xmath0 in the two layers rather than the same value in both as was appropriate when varying the planetary value of @xmath0 in the theoretical development above . in the top layer",
    "the zonal mean potential vorticity gradient ( pv gradient ) is @xmath146 , with @xmath147 designated the planetary value of @xmath0 , and in the bottom layer it is @xmath148 , in which the planetary value of @xmath0 has been designated @xmath147 and the topographic value @xmath149 .",
    "the equations are modified as follows :    [ eq : brcl12 ] @xmath150    with the barotropic , @xmath151 , and baroclinic , @xmath152 , defined as : @xmath153    the s3 t system is modified accordingly . from we see that the effective value of @xmath0 seen by waves with primarily barotropic structure such as the planetary wave @xmath142 that is implicated in the dynamics of the npj equilibration is the sum of the planetary value @xmath154 and half the topographic value , @xmath155 .",
    "results similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltau ] for the case of equal @xmath0 in both layers are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaubca ] for the case of a topographic @xmath0 effect with @xmath156 in the bottom layer and @xmath157 in the top layer .",
    "even with equal excitation of the background turbulence in both layers ( @xmath158 case ) both the jet and the waves become slightly baroclinic as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaubca ] and the jet in this case obtains a higher equilibrium amplitude in the lower layer consistent with the higher effective value of @xmath0 there .",
    "however , when excitation is restricted to the top layer ( @xmath102 case in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaubca ] ) the jet in the top layer is the stronger .    assuming only the top layer is excited a topographic @xmath0 component in the lower layer of @xmath159 when combined with the planetary @xmath160 results in consistency with the npj upper layer observations as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaubca ] . with a layer depth equal to one scale height on saturn , @xmath161",
    ", the required lower layer slope is @xmath162 implying a density surface dynamically equivalent to the bottom boundary sloping downward toward the pole over the channel width of @xmath163 from @xmath164 to @xmath165 ( measured from the top boundary ) .",
    "we remark that the prominent @xmath1 n jet of jupiter conforms with the lightly damped jet scaling using the planetary value of @xmath166 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : unorm ] which result verifies previous findings @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the stable lower layer inferred to underly saturn s npj is peculiar to the anomalous thermal and dynamical conditions observed near saturn s north pole .",
    "the s3 t jet structure in the upper layer with the parameter values given above , which were chosen to model the npj , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ub1b2f5 ] . a polar representation of the jet and the associated @xmath142 wave is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vpolar5 ] .",
    "the jet equilibration process is essentially similar to that described in the previous section in which the planetary value of @xmath0 was varied . as in the previous case ,",
    "most of the perturbation variance is concentrated in the nearly neutral wave 6 which has a critical layer inside the retrograde jet as can be seen in the resolvent response of the @xmath142 wave shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolvent5 ] . again , this nearly neutral wave with critical layer inside the retrograde jet and with primarily non - normal energetics is in large part responsible for producing the upgradient flux to exactly cancel the downgradient flux produced by the waves @xmath167 resulting in establishment of the turbulent equilibrium . in fig .",
    "[ fig : adj ] is shown three snapshots of the temporal development of the optimal initial condition for exciting the ldm demonstrating the dominance of non - normal dynamics in the establishment of this mode .",
    "it is interesting to note that the optimal excitation of this mode , which is its adjoint @xcite , is initially concentrated in the retrograde jet ( cf .",
    "[ fig : adj ] ) .",
    "as in the previous example and as is required for neutrality , the pv gradient in both the upper and lower critical layers ( @xmath168 and @xmath169 ) is eliminated , primarily by fluxes arising from the non - normal dynamics , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ucritical ] .",
    "the potential vorticity gradient reversals seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ucritical ] , which are observed in both jupiter and saturn and predicted by the s3 t equilibria , provide a probe of the dynamical processes at work in the equilibration of these large amplitude jets .",
    "as previously discussed in connection with the planetary @xmath0 variation example , a strong reversal of @xmath168 near the minimum of the retrograde jet results from upgradient vorticity fluxes produced by the @xmath170 waves .",
    "the resulting region of potential vorticity gradient reversal is not opposed by the ldm which enforces its own stabilization by eliminating the pv gradient in the vicinity of its critical layers leaving the quite extensive region between these critical layers satisfying the rayleigh - kuo necessary condition as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ucritical ] .",
    "note that the bottom layer pv gradient has also been eliminted in the region between the critical layers of the @xmath142 wave .",
    "however , in this case with excitation limited to the top layer the shorter waves do not penetrate adequately into the bottom layer to produce sufficiently strong upgradient fluxes to form a pv gradient reversal .",
    "reversals in pv gradient in the retrograde jet are associated with positive curvature of the mean flow .",
    "the predicted curvature of the mean flow in the top layer is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : d2uobs ] against raw observations from @xcite",
    ". discussion tends to center on the maximum at the wings of the prograde jet which is responsible for supporting modes associated with the secondary maximum in the resolvent at phase speeds in the prograde jet seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolvent5 ] .",
    "however , the modes associated with this prograde jet pv reversal are insignificant in the dynamics .",
    "the dynamically significant pv gradient reversal is that between the critical layers of the dominant @xmath142 wave . neither of these features is well resolved in the data but we believe that better observations of the pv in the retrograde jets would resolve the dynamically significant reversal between the @xmath142 critical layers",
    "large - scale coherent structures such as jets , meandering jets and waves embedded in jets are characteristic features of turbulence in planetary atmospheres . while conservation of energy and enstrophy in inviscid 2d turbulence predicts spectral evolution leading to concentration of energy at large scales , these considerations can not predict the phase of the spectral components and therefore can neither address the central question of the organization of the energy into jets with specific structure nor the existence of the coherent component of the planetary scale waves . in order to study structure formation additional aspects of the turbulence dynamics beyond conservation principles",
    "must be incorporated in the analysis .",
    "ssd models have been developed to study turbulence dynamics and specifically to solve for turbulent state equilibria consisting of coexisting coherent mean structures and incoherent turbulent components which together constitute the complete state of the turbulence . in this work",
    "an ssd two - layer baroclinic model was used to study the regime of a coexisting jet and wave in saturn s npj .",
    "this second order ssd model , referred to as the s3 t model , is closed by a stochastic parameterization that accounts for both the neglected nonlinear dynamics of the perturbations from the zonal mean as well as the excitation maintaining the turbulence .",
    "the equation for the zonal mean retains its interaction through reynolds stress with the perturbations .    in this model a jet forms as an instability and grows at first exponentially eventually equilibrating at finite amplitude . exploiting the simplicity of the asymptotic regime",
    "in which the jet is undamped makes it possible to obtain a universal jet structure and jet amplitude scaling .",
    "having obtained an understanding of the physical mechanism underlying this asymptotic scaling it was established that the associated amplitude scaling was necessarily robust which compelled the conclusion that the observed structure of the npj requires a value of @xmath0 greater than the planetary value .",
    "this implied existence of a topographic beta effect with a specific predicted value . incorporating",
    "the required poleward decreasing stable layer depth into the model produced the observed jet structure . in the model",
    "a stable retrograde mode of the rossby wave spectrum with wavenumber six becomes nearly neutrally stable as the jet amplitude increased and by inducing strong non - normal interaction with the jet arrests its growth via perturbation reynolds stresses .",
    "this composite structure equilibrates in the form of a hexagonal jet in agreement with the npj observations . among the observational correlates of this theory",
    "is the predicted existence of robust pv gradient reversals in both the prograde and retrograde jets as well as the location and structure of these reversals .",
