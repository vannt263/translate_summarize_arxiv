    "in these last few years there has been a growing interest in the study of complex networks @xcite , which can help to describe many social , biological , and communication systems , such as co - author networks  @xcite , sexual networks  @xcite , metabolic networks  @xcite , protein networks in the cell  @xcite , internet  @xcite , and the world wide web  @xcite .",
    "extensive observational studies show that many real - life networks have at least three important common statistical characteristics : the degree distribution exhibits a power law tail with an exponent taking a value between 2 and 3 ( _ scale - free _ ) ; nodes having a common neighbor are far more likely to be linked to each other than are two nodes selected randomly ( _ highly clustered _ ) ; the expected number of links needed to go from one arbitrarily selected node to another one is low ( _ small - world property _ ) .",
    "these empirical findings have lead to a new kind of network models  @xcite .",
    "the research on these new models was started by the two seminal papers by watts and strogatz on small - world networks @xcite and barabsi and albert on scale - free networks @xcite . a wide variety of network models and mechanisms , including initial attractiveness  @xcite , nonlinear preferential attachment  @xcite , aging and cost  @xcite , competitive dynamics  @xcite , edge rewiring  @xcite and removal  @xcite , duplication  @xcite , which may represent processes realistically taking place in real - life systems , have been proposed .",
    "recently , based on the classical apollonian packing , andrade _ et al .",
    "_ introduced apollonian networks  @xcite which were simultaneously proposed by doye and massen in  @xcite .",
    "apollonian networks belong to a deterministic type of networks studied earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite which have received much interest recently  @xcite .",
    "two - dimensional apollonian networks are simultaneously scale - free , small - world , euclidean , space filling , and with matching graphs  @xcite .",
    "they may provide valuable insight into real - life networks ; moreover , they are maximal planar graphs and this property is of particular interest for the layout of printed circuits and related problems  @xcite .",
    "more recently , some interesting dynamical processes @xcite , such as percolation @xcite , epidemic spreading @xcite , synchronization @xcite , and random walks @xcite , taking place on these networks have been also investigated .",
    "networks are composed of vertices ( nodes ) and edges ( links ) and are very often studied considering branch of discrete mathematics known as graph theory .",
    "one active subject in graph theory is graph labeling  @xcite .",
    "this is not only due to its theoretical importance but also because of the wide range of applications in many fields  @xcite , such as x - rays , crystallography , coding theory , radar , astronomy , circuit design , and communication design .    in this paper",
    "we present an extension of the general high dimensional apollonian networks  @xcite which includes the deterministic small - world network introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we give a vertex labeling , so that queries for the shortest path between any two vertices can be efficiently answered thanks to it .",
    "finding shortest paths in networks is a well - studied and important problem with also many applications  @xcite",
    ". our labeling may be useful in aspects such as network optimization and information dissemination , which are directly related to the problem of finding shortest paths between all pairs of vertices of the network .",
    "in this section we present a network model defined in a iterative way .",
    "the model , which we call _ expanded apollonian network _ ( ean ) , is an extension of the general high dimensional apollonian network  @xcite which includes the deterministic small - world network introduced in  @xcite .",
    "the networks , denoted by @xmath0 after @xmath1 iterations with @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are constructed as follows . for @xmath4",
    ", @xmath5 is a complete graph @xmath6 ( or @xmath7-clique ) . for @xmath8 , @xmath0",
    "is obtained from @xmath9 .",
    "for each of the existing subgraphs of @xmath9 that is isomorphic to a @xmath10-clique and created at step @xmath11 , a new vertex is created and connected to all the vertices of this subgraph .",
    "figure  [ network ] shows the network growing process for the particular case where @xmath12 .",
    ", showing the first two steps of growing process . , width=302 ]    let @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the number of vertices and edges created at step @xmath1 , respectively . according to the network construction , one can see that at step @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) the number of newly introduced vertices and edges is @xmath17 and @xmath18 . from these results",
    ", we can easily compute the total number of vertices @xmath19 and edges @xmath20 at step @xmath1 , which are @xmath21}{d}$ ] and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "so for large @xmath1 , the average degree @xmath23 is approximately @xmath24 .",
    "this general model includes existing models , as listed below .    indeed , when @xmath25 , the network is the deterministic small - world network ( dswn ) introduced in  @xcite and further generalized in  @xcite .",
    "dswn is an exponential network , its degree distribution @xmath26 is an exponential of a power of degree @xmath27 . for a node of degree @xmath27 ,",
    "the exact clustering coefficient is @xmath28 .",
    "the average clustering coefficient of dswn is @xmath29 , which approaches to a high constant value 0.6931 .",
    "the average path length of dswn grows logarithmically with the number of network vertices  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath30 , the networks are exactly the same as the high - dimensional apollonian networks ( hdan ) with @xmath31 indicating the dimension  @xcite .",
    "hdan present the typical characteristics of real - life networks in nature and society , and their main topological properties are controlled by dimension @xmath31 .",
    "they have a power law degree distribution with exponent @xmath32 belonging to the interval between 2 and 3  @xcite . for any individual vertex in hdan ,",
    "its clustering coefficient @xmath33 is also inversely proportional to its degree @xmath27 as @xmath34 .",
    "the mean value @xmath35 of clustering coefficient of all vertices in hdan is very large and is an increasing function of @xmath31 .",
    "for instance , in the special cases where @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath35 asymptotically reaches values 0.8284 and 0.8852 , respectively .",
    "in addition , hdan are small worlds .",
    "the diameter of hdan , defined as the longest shortest distance between all pairs of vertices , increases logarithmically with the number of vertices .",
    "so , the ean model exhibits a transition from an exponential network ( @xmath25 ) to scale - free networks ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "vertex labeling of a network is an assignment of labels to all the vertices in the network . in most applications ,",
    "labels are nonnegative integers , though in general real numbers could be used  @xcite . in this section ,",
    "we describe a way to label the vertices of @xmath0 , for any @xmath2 and @xmath3 , such that a routing by shortest paths between any two vertices of @xmath0 can be deduced from the labels .",
    "we note that a more general result on shortest paths routing of graphs with given treewidth is given in  @xcite .",
    "however , here we address the more specific case of the expanded apollonian networks @xmath0 . in what follows , we will denote @xmath38 as the label of vertex @xmath39 , for any vertex @xmath39 belonging to @xmath0 .    here",
    "the labeling idea , inspired from  @xcite , is to assign to any vertex @xmath39 created at step @xmath8 a label of length @xmath1 , in the form of a word of @xmath1 digits , each digit being an integer between 1 and @xmath40 ( the vertices obtained at step @xmath4 , i.e. the vertices of the _ initial _ ( @xmath40)-clique @xmath5 , are assigned a special label ) .",
    "more precisely , the labeling of any vertex @xmath39 of @xmath0 is done thanks to the following rules :    * label the vertices of the initial ( @xmath40)-clique @xmath5 arbitrarily , with labels @xmath41 .",
    "* at any step @xmath8 , when a new vertex @xmath39 is added and joined to all vertices of a clique @xmath42 : 1 .",
    "if @xmath39 is connected to @xmath43 vertices of the initial ( @xmath40)-clique , then @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the only vertex of the initial ( @xmath40)-clique that does not belong to this @xmath10-clique .",
    "if not , then @xmath39 is connected to @xmath46 , where at least one of the @xmath47 s is not a vertex of the initial ( @xmath40)-clique . thus , any such vertex has a label @xmath48 . w.l.o.g .",
    ", let @xmath49 be the vertex not belonging to the initial ( @xmath40)-clique with the longest label . in that case , we give vertex @xmath39 the label @xmath38 defined as follows : @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the only integer not appearing as first digit in the labels of @xmath46 , that is @xmath52 ( the fact that @xmath53 is unique will be proved by property 1 below ) .    .",
    "( below ) labels of a part of the vertices of @xmath54,title=\"fig:\",width=340 ] .",
    "( below ) labels of a part of the vertices of @xmath54,title=\"fig:\",width=491 ]    .",
    "such a labeling is illustrated in figure  [ labeling01 ] . in the upper part of this figure ,",
    "we label the vertices of @xmath0 , for @xmath25 and up to @xmath55 .",
    "we see that vertex @xmath56 , created at step 1 , has label @xmath57 because it is not connected to vertex @xmath58 of the initial 3-clique ( triangle ) .",
    "vertex @xmath59 is is not connected to any vertex of the initial 3-clique , its label is first composed of the only digit not appearing as first digit of its neighbors ( in this case , 1 ) , concatenated with the longest label of its neighbors ( in this case , 23 ) .",
    "analogously , in the lower part of figure  [ labeling01 ] , where , for sake of clarity , only a part of @xmath54 is drawn , the vertices have been labeled . for the same reasons",
    ", we can see that vertex @xmath56 has label @xmath60 , while @xmath59 has label @xmath61 .",
    "thus , we see that for any @xmath8 , any vertex @xmath62 created at step @xmath1 has a unique label , and that for any vertex @xmath39 created at step @xmath8 , @xmath63 is of length @xmath1 , where each digit @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65  ; while the vertices created at step @xmath66 have length 1 ( these are the @xmath45 , @xmath67 ) .",
    "we note that since for any step @xmath8 , the number of vertices that are added to the expanded apollonian networks is equal to @xmath68 , the labeling we propose is optimal in the sense that each label @xmath69 of a vertex created at step @xmath1 is a @xmath7-ary word of length @xmath1 .",
    "globally , any vertex of @xmath0 is assigned a label of length @xmath70  ; since there are @xmath71 vertices in @xmath0 , we can see that , overall , the labeling is optimal as well .",
    "next , we give three properties about the above labeling .",
    "property 1 ensures that our labeling is deterministic .",
    "property 2 is a tool to prove property 3 , the latter being important to show that our routing protocol is valid and of shortest paths .    * property 1 * in @xmath0 , for any ( @xmath40)-clique induced by vertices @xmath49 , @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74",
    ", every integer @xmath75 appears exactly once as the first digit of the label of a @xmath76 . *",
    "* by induction on @xmath1 . when @xmath77 , the property is true by construction",
    "suppose now that the property is true for any @xmath78 , and let us then show it is true for @xmath1 .",
    "any ( @xmath40)-clique in @xmath0 is composed of exactly one vertex @xmath39 created at a given step @xmath79 , and @xmath43 vertices @xmath80 created at steps strictly less than @xmath79 . if @xmath81 , then the property is true by induction hypothesis . if @xmath82 , we suppose that @xmath74 is connected to a @xmath10-clique @xmath83 composed of @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath83 did not exist at step @xmath11 . in other words ,",
    "one of the @xmath47 s , say @xmath49 , has been created at step @xmath11 , based on @xmath43 vertices @xmath84 and @xmath85 . by induction hypothesis",
    ", each integer @xmath75 appears exactly once as first digit of the labels of @xmath86 .",
    "however , by construction , the first digit of @xmath87 is the first digit of @xmath88 .",
    "thus we conclude that each integer @xmath75 also appears exactly once as first digit of the labels of @xmath89 , and the result is proved by induction . *",
    "property 2 * let @xmath62 be a vertex of @xmath0 created at step @xmath8 . among the vertices",
    "@xmath80 forming the @xmath10-clique that generated @xmath62 , let @xmath90 , @xmath91 , be the vertices that do not belong to the initial ( @xmath40)-clique .",
    "then @xmath69 is a superstring of @xmath92 for all @xmath93 . *",
    "* by induction on @xmath1 . when @xmath77 , any vertex @xmath94 created at step 1 is connected to vertices of the initial ( @xmath40)-clique only .",
    "thus the result is true .",

    "hence , in @xmath83 , @xmath97 is the vertex not belonging to the initial ( @xmath40)-clique that has the longest label . by construction of @xmath69",
    ", we have that @xmath102 , thus we also conclude that @xmath103 for any @xmath93 .",
    "thus @xmath69 is a superstring of the labels of any vertex of @xmath83 that does not belong to the initial ( @xmath40)-clique , and the result is proved by induction .    *",

    "+ now we suppose that the property is true for any @xmath109 , @xmath96 , and we will show it then holds for @xmath1 as well . as for the previous property , we consider a vertex @xmath62 created at step @xmath1 , and the @xmath10-clique @xmath83 it is connected to .",
    "+ suppose @xmath62 is connected to a vertex @xmath110 that was created at step @xmath11 .",

    "thus , neither @xmath110 nor any vertex among the @xmath118 s , @xmath119 contains the digit @xmath107 in its label .",
    "hence , only a vertex @xmath120 from the initial ( @xmath40)-clique can have @xmath107 in its label , and thus @xmath121 . hence it suffices to show that @xmath62 and @xmath120 are neighbors to prove the property .",
    "the only case for which this would not happen is when @xmath122  ; we will show that this is not possible .",
    "indeed , by construction of the labels , the first digit of @xmath69 is the only integer not appearing as first digit of the labels of the vertices of @xmath83 , that is @xmath123 .",

    "now we describe the routing protocol between any two vertices @xmath56 and @xmath39 of @xmath0 , with labels respectively equal to @xmath124 and @xmath38 .",
    "we note that since @xmath5 is isomorphic to the complete graph @xmath6 , we can assume @xmath8 .",
