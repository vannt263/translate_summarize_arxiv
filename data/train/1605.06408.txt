    "<S> the effect of evaporation rate has long been noticed on the morphology of polymer films.@xcite recently , driving particle assembly with fast evaporation has been demonstrated for gold nps using a one - step , near - infrared radiation - assisted evaporation process.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to test experimentally if fast evaporation can be combined with tuned np / polymer interactions to control the np dispersion in polymer films . </S>",
    "<S> that nps move to the surface of a polymer film during solvent evaporation has been frequently observed in experiments where the nps and polymers are immiscible.@xcite our simulations show that this can also occur with miscible nps when the solvent evaporates rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> we should note that the conditions here are different from those in the experiment by krishnan et al.@xcite who showed that the nps diffuse to the surface of either the substrate or the polymer film after thermal annealing . in our case </S>",
    "<S> the accumulation ( depletion ) of nps near the film ( substrate ) surface is induced by the fast evaporation that magnifies the `` nonequilibrium '' factor . </S>",
    "<S> our results further show that for the immiscible np / polymer systems , the nps can still remain dispersed in the polymer film after solvent evaporation . </S>",
    "<S> the key strategy is to use fast evaporation to drive the quick formation of the surface polymer layer , which serves as a barrier to prevent the nps from diffusing to the surface of the film . </S>"
