    "spallation reactions induced by relativistic protons on @xmath0ta lead to excited target remnants with large fission barriers ( 20 - 25 mev ) covering a broad range in excitation energy .",
    "the investigation of the fission process under these extreme conditions is expected to provide relevant information on the dynamics of fission at high excitation energies . on the other hand ,",
    "tantalum and tungsten alloys are proposed as optimum materials for the construction of spallation neutron sources because of their properties under extreme irradiation conditions : relatively large neutron production , corrosion resistance , and a high melting point .",
    "spallation targets are of interest in different domains .",
    "one of the technologies which relies on spallation reactions is that of accelerator - driven systems , ads  @xcite , which are currently under study as an option for nuclear waste incineration .",
    "recently the construction of the ess ( european spallation source )  @xcite facility has been approved and different research communities are awaiting its opening to undertake a wide range of experimental programs in material science , biology and other scientific disciplines .",
    "tantalum targets are also used for the production of exotic nuclei at isol - type  @xcite facilities and neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "fission may have a significant effect on the performance of a spallation target .",
    "therefore , a good knowledge of the interaction of protons ( commonly used as spallation sources drivers ) with these materials is mandatory for their characterization .",
    "reactions leading to fission are of interest because they contribute to the production of hazardous remnants , in particular gaseous ones , such as the isotopes of kr and xe . the composition of that radioactive inventory , its evolution , the influence of these changes to the target performance itself and its structural damages can be estimated with state - of - the - art models .",
    "however , only through an evaluation of numerical calculations with accurate data it is possible to validate these models and improve their reliability for use in technical applications .",
    "nuclear fission is , indeed , a process which demands a complex description of the fissioning nucleus according to its excitation energy , angular momentum , fission barrier and the time taken to reach the scission point .",
    "a first approach to the fission description in terms of process probability was proposed by bohr and wheeler  @xcite from a purely statistical standpoint . in parallel , kramers  @xcite introduced a dynamical description of the fission process based on the coupling between internal ( excitation energy ) and collective ( deformation ) degrees of freedom through a dissipation parameter . based on these ideas , grang _ et al . _",
    "@xcite went a step further by including a time - dependent solution of the fission width that recently has been analytically formulated  @xcite .",
    "many experimental results have already indicated the role of dissipative and transient effects in the fission process at high excitation energy  @xcite .",
    "manifestations of these effects have also been observed in spallation - induced fission reactions  @xcite , in particular with sub - actinide targets  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , presently available data related to total fission cross sections of @xmath0ta above 700  mev proton - beam energy are scarce and show clear discrepancies at 1000  mev  @xcite .",
    "the situation does not improve at lower energies , where the available data are more abundant , but they also present inconsistent results  @xcite , in particular between 300 and 500  mev .",
    "most of these experiments were performed using passive track detectors and only few of them are based on coincident measurements of both fission fragments  @xcite . under such conditions",
    "it seems difficult to unambiguously identify a fission channel with a few mb cross section as is expected in this case .",
    "all previous measurements of fission reactions induced by protons on @xmath0ta were performed using the direct kinematics technique .",
    "therefore , the reaction products have a very low kinetic energy , preventing their escape from the target . to overcome this difficulty the inverse kinematics technique was utilised in the present work .",
    "several experiments performed at the frs ( fragment separator ) spectrometer using the inverse kinematics technique  @xcite measured the mass and charge of fission residues with high precision , in addition to the fission cross sections . however",
    ", the transmission of the fission fragments was limited by the acceptance of the spectrometer , and only one fission fragment was measured .",
    "therefore , a dedicated experimental setup was used in the present work in order to register both fission fragments in coincidence with high efficiency and resolution  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we show the results of the experiment performed at gsi ( helmholtzzentrum fr schwerionenforschung ) aimed at measuring the total fission cross section of @xmath0ta induced by protons in the energy range between 300 mev and 1000 mev taking advantage of the inverse kinematics . the dedicated experimental setup , enabled the measurement of the cross - sections with high precision . our results will allow for benchmarking the state - of - the - art models , and provide data for systematic descriptions",
    "in the present experiment , the @xmath0ta nuclei were accelerated using the basic installation of gsi , the unilac linear accelerator and the sis-18 synchrotron , up to 300 , 500 , 800 and 1000 a mev with an intensity of the order of 10@xmath1  ions / s and a spill duration of 7  s. these beams impinged onto a liquid hydrogen target . due to the kinematics of the reaction , we were able to detect efficiently both fission fragments which were emitted in the forward direction with large kinetic energies .",
    "this capability enabled the use of relatively thick targets , increasing the statistics .",

    "[ fig : setup ] . a multi - wire chamber ( mw ) and",
    "thick iron slits were used to collimate the @xmath0ta beam at the target .",
    "a first scintillator detector ( start ) placed upstream of the target , determined the beam flux .",
    "the target consisted of a liquid hydrogen cell ( 85  mg/@xmath2 ) inside a container with 100  @xmath3 m titanium windows and a cryostat for liquefying the hydrogen .",
    "the target was surrounded by two multi - sampling ionization chambers ( music )  @xcite ( 200  mm x 80  mm window surface and 460  mm of active length ) which measured the energy loss of the tantalum beam particles and that of the products of the reaction , respectively .",
    "these ionization chambers , having almost 100  % efficiency for the detection of relativistic heavy nuclei , were used to identify reactions of @xmath0ta produced in the hydrogen target and in any other layer of matter present in the beam line . a veto scintillator with a 15  mm diameter hole placed just before the target allowed the rejection of beam - halo particles and misaligned beam trajectories .",
    "the two fission fragments were detected independently , but in temporal coincidence , by a double paddle scintillator placed downstream of the target ( 300  mm x 70  mm and 3  mm thickness each paddle ) . according to the setup geometry ,",
    "two different triggers were used for data acquisition : the  beam \" trigger was provided by the plastic scintillator placed upstream of the target in anticoincidence with the signal of the veto scintillator .",
    "the  reaction \" trigger was produced by the coincidence between the  beam \" trigger and the time - coincident signals on both paddles of the double scintillator placed downstream the target .",

    "the average rates for the  beam \" and  reaction \" triggers were around @xmath4 and 700  triggers / s , respectively .",
    "beam \" trigger was downscaled to reduce the data acquisition dead time .",

    "events inducing high and small energy loss signals , correspond to residual heavy nuclei and emitted light nuclei from evaporation processes .",
    "since the energy loss of nuclei is proportional to their atomic number squared ( _ z@xmath5 _ ) , fission fragments are expected to produce energy loss signals corresponding to about half of the value obtained for the primary beam ( _ @xmath6 _ ) . therefore , fission products should be located around channel 1800 on the music 2 energy loss axis . to count for the fission events , _ n@xmath7 _ , a condition in the scatter plot shown in fig .",
