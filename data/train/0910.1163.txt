    "since the dawn of quantum theory , the tunneling effect has been recognized as a representative of genuine quantum phenomena .",
    "this does not necessarily imply that the tunneling effect has nothing to do with underlying classical dynamics .",
    "what recently attracts much interest concerns the fact that quantum tunneling in multidimensional systems or more specifically in non - integrable systems strongly reflects the phase - space structures of the corresponding classical system @xcite .",
    "what is specific in generic nonintegrable systems which are neither completely integrable nor fully chaotic is that phase space is divided into infinitely many invariant components and they are generally intermingled with each other .",
    "the transition between different invariant components is forbidden in classical dynamics , and invariant components form dynamical barriers in phase space . on the other hand , in quantum mechanics ,",
    "the transition through dynamical barriers thus formed may be allowed as a result of quantum effects .",
    "in particular , based on the notion of quasimodes @xcite , the quantum transition between congruent tori which are symmetrically formed in phase space is called _ dynamical tunneling _ in the literature @xcite .",
    "dynamical tunneling happens in mixed - types phase space where invariant tori and chaotic regions coexist .",
    "this fact immediately invokes a question about the possible roles of chaos in the process of dynamical tunneling .",
    "the notion of _ chaos - assisted tunneling _ has been proposed to capture the situation where , besides quasi - doublet states localized on symmetrically formed congruent tori , chaotic states take part in the tunneling process @xcite .",
    "semiclassical analysis in the time domain also reveals that a bunch of tunneling trajectories associated with chaos , or more precisely the julia set in complex plane , is involved in dynamical tunneling in mixed phase space @xcite .",
    "what was commonly emphasized there was an aspect that _ chaos enhances dynamical tunneling .",
    "_    on the contrary , we here focus on another aspect of the role of chaos .",
    "in particular , it may happen that _",
    "dynamical tunneling is suppressed even in the presence of chaos . _ as explained below , there exist two competing effects behind the dynamical tunneling process , both of which originate from the nature of complex classical trajectories describing the tunneling transition from torus to chaos .    as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , exponentially many complex trajectories , not a single instanton path as in integrable tunneling , contribute to the semiclassical time evolution operator which allows us to evaluate the tunneling amplitude from torus to chaotic regions .",
    "such complex trajectories start from an initial state placed in the torus region and reach a final state in the chaotic sea .",
    "an important fact is that in the first stage in their itinerary these complex orbits have non - small imaginary components and move in the complex plane , whereas the orbits are soon attracted by the real plane along stable manifolds and then move very close to the real plane in the later stage .",
    "the rate of the attraction is exponentially fast , reflecting the fact that the behavior of the orbits is controlled by the stable manifolds of unstable periodic orbits in the real phase space @xcite .",
    "these observations imply that complex trajectories describing the tunneling transport have _ amphibious _ character : they act as tunneling orbits when they stay in the torus region and behave as if they are almost real orbits when reaching the chaotic sea @xcite . a well recognized aspect of dynamical tunneling ,",
    "that is , the enhancement of tunneling , is explained by the fact that the number of tunneling orbits is exponentially many @xcite .",
    "however , their contributions to the tunneling amplitude are merely `` potentially existing '' .",
    "this is because the time evolution in the later stage may involve opposite effects on the transport property , especially when _ dynamical localization _ governs the quantum dynamics in the chaotic region @xcite .",
    "the amphibious nature of complex orbits predicts that the tunneling penetration through integrable barriers and the dynamics in the chaotic sea are not independent of each other , rather they must be closely related .",
    "therefore , we expect that if the spreading of wave function is suppressed due to dynamical localization in the chaotic sea , which appears as a result of destructive interference effects , the tunneling transport is simultaneously suppressed . in order words ,",
    "potentially existing tunneling orbits are exponentially many , but they interfere with each other to form localization .",
    "this is our working hypothesis and the purpose of this paper is just to verify that there exists strong interplay between dynamical tunneling and dynamical localization .    in order to confirm our hypothesis ,",
    "that dynamical tunneling is significantly reduced as a consequence of dynamical localization , our strategy is to apply noise to destroy the destructive interference generating dynamical localization .",
    "the idea is essentially the same as the one which has been used to see that the recovery of classical diffusion occurs when external noise is applied to dynamically localized states @xcite . in the present case , to avoid noise - activated hopping from torus to chaos , we selectively add noise only to the chaotic region with the torus region being untouched",
    ".    we should mention that the interplay between dynamical tunneling and dynamical localization is crucial to understand the emergence of _ amphibious eigenstates _",
    "@xcite . in @xcite",
    "they suggested the competition between the effective heisenberg time and the tunneling time is important to determine whether eigenfunctions show amphibious nature .",
    "the former time scale concerns dynamical localization and the latter dynamical tunneling .",
    "therefore , the _ flooding _ of eigenfunction found in @xcite can be interpreted as a consequence of the flooding of potentially existing tunneling orbits .",

    "[ sec : phasespaceenginnering ] , we present an area - preserving map that is designed to have phase space clearly separated into torus and chaotic regions . to verify our hypothesis stated above , a noise term is added .",
    "the noise term is characterized by two parameters : the strength @xmath0 and the distance @xmath1 from the border between torus and chaotic sea . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cat ] , we first investigate the case without noise as a reference for our subsequent argument about the case with noise .",

    "an interesting finding is that there exists a region of @xmath1 in which the tunneling rate decreases even though planck s constant becomes large .",
    "this is exactly because of the strong interplay between dynamical tunneling and dynamical localization . in sec .",

    "classical phase space in a mixed system is very complex in general ; besides chaotic components , a variety of invariant components such as kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) circles , islands of stability , or cantori live together in a single phase space .",
    "great difficulties arise not only in classical but also in quantum dynamics in mixed systems due to the immense complexity of phase space .    in order to avoid complicated effects due to the mixture of different types of invariant structures ,",
    "one strategy is to make the phase space `` clean . ''",

    "a possible explanation is that the effect of resonance is attenuated by moderate noise .",
    "we summarize the results for weak and intermediate noise intensity regions : an overall trend is that @xmath2 increases on average , whereas the fluctuation of @xmath2 decreases with increase in @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that , in the weak and intermediate regions , there exists a competition of two different interference effects ; one is a constructive interference induced by resonances , and the other a destructive interference associated with dynamical localization .",
    "the former and the latter correspond to the changes of the fluctuation and the average of @xmath2 , respectively .    for large @xmath0 ,",
    "it is natural to expect that these interference effects become totally incoherent .",

    "what is most important is that @xmath2 seems to converge to a certain value .",

    "our scenario for the numerical study of small @xmath157 cases is almost the same as before : launch a wave function from an approximate torus state @xmath70 and monitor the time evolution of @xmath55 .",

    "this suggests that the changes of the small islands at different noise strengths do not have any influence on the tunneling process .    in the absence of noise , whether the quasienergy resonance occurs or not , the wave function is almost bounded in the torus region and only a small fraction of tunneling tail penetrates the dynamical barrier .",

    "we comment on the contribution from the island states , which was not taken into account in the explanation in section  [ sec : p2pi ] .",
    "this is expected to be small , since the variation in @xmath11 influences only on the region far apart from the torus region , and the quasienergies of island states do not depend on @xmath11 .",
    "if a quasienergy resonance is sensitive with respect to @xmath11 , it must involve a localized state in the chaotic sea .",
    "hence we conclude such a resonance is the origin of the strong fluctuation .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s - amp - gamma_deformedcase ] ( b ) , we have confirmed that chaotic tunneling is restored even for small @xmath157 , and that the behavior of the decay rate @xmath2 also persists .",
    "we note that @xmath2 for small @xmath157 needs to be deliberately determined from the time series of @xmath55 because the deformation of the tori near the border makes the preparation of an initial torus state difficult @xcite .",
    "in the present numerical experiment , we again take @xmath70 as an initial state which is independent with @xmath157 ( see appendix  [ sec : quantizetorus ] , with @xmath168 . ) .",
    "the discrepancy of @xmath70 from an approximate eigenstate on the torus produces multiple characteristic time scales in @xmath55 , each of which is associated with an individual torus state .",

    "evidence justifying such a procedure is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : s - amp - gamma_deformedcase](b ) : the positions of oscillation peaks for the case without noise @xmath93 are in good agreement with those for the case with small @xmath0 . with increase in @xmath0 , we can see that sensitive dependence of @xmath2 gradually disappears , and @xmath2 becomes larger on average .",
    "all these are consistent with the results for large @xmath157 .    here",
    "we show another reasoning that the deformation of islands with the changes of @xmath11 does not induce the sensitive fluctuations of the amplitude of the tunneling oscillations and @xmath2 in fig .",

    ", the fluctuation in @xmath2 disappears with sufficiently strong noise .",
    "hence we conclude that these fluctuations sensitive to @xmath11 are mainly due to the quasienergy resonance .",
    "in this paper , we have shown that there exists a very close relation between dynamical tunneling and dynamical localization . as mentioned in the introduction , chaos - assisted tunneling or chaotic tunneling",
    "is usually understood as a mechanism which enhances tunneling .",
    "it is certainly true that the transition between quasi - doublets , whose support in phase space is symmetric tori , acquires additional tunneling pathways with the assistance of chaotic states .",
    "semiclassical arguments also provide a similar picture : exponentially many tunneling paths connect the torus region to the chaotic sea .",
    "on the other hand , what we have seen in the present paper is another aspect of the role of chaos in the tunneling process .",
    "since the tunneling effect is a typical non - local wave phenomenon , it is natural to expect that what is happening in chaotic regions must affect the nature of the wave function in the integrable region and vice versa . it is well known that even without stable invariant components , wave - functions in the chaotic sea are localized in nontrivial ways , e.g. , scarring due to unstable periodic orbits @xcite , localization on cantori , and dynamical localization .",
    "one may thus ask the question how and to what extent such wave effects appearing in the chaotic region affect or are influenced by dynamical tunneling between torus and chaos .",
    "here we focused particularly on the interplay between tunneling and dynamical localization and gave evidence that the non - local nature of quantum tunneling becomes manifest if one of the quantum effects , that is dynamical localization , is attenuated . if we add noise to the chaotic region , which destroys the interference generating dynamical localization , drastic enhancement of the tunneling rate is observed .",
    "the result may be interpreted in two different ways : on one hand , we may simply say that chaotic tunneling is strongly amplified under the influence of noise .",
    "on the other hand , we may regard the drastic enhancement of the tunneling rate as a result of manifestation of _ potentially existing _ chaotic tunneling .",
    "the former interpretation is a bit too naive , but most arguments concerning chaotic tunneling so far have been based on this picture .",
    "this implicitly assumes that chaotic tunneling is already present even without noise and it occurs _ irrespective of the status of surrounding chaotic seas_. in this picture , the tunneling process ends when the wave function goes through kam barriers , and the behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeevo - nonreso ] is viewed as manifestation of chaotic tunneling .    in contrast , a semiclassical argument employing complex classical orbits strongly supports and is consistent with the latter interpretation . as mentioned in the introduction , complex orbits contributing to the tunneling amplitude have an amphibious character .",
    "they play the role of tunneling orbits when they move into the integrable domain , but behave as almost real orbits after escaping out of the integrable domain .",
    "there are exponentially many complex orbits even in the integrable regime , and they flow into the chaotic sea @xcite . since these orbits are almost completely governed by the real dynamics in the chaotic sea , the diffusive motion is suppressed by dynamical localization as in the genuine real dynamics . in this sense",
    "we can say that the tunneling decay is inhibited due to dynamical localization in the chaotic sea , and exponentially many potentially existing tunneling orbits appear if noise destroys the coherence creating localization .",
    "if this interpretation is true , it should be possible to explain the maximal tunneling rate , which was observed in the strong noise limit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_s_epsilon ] ) and called a  classical  tunneling rate , by evaluating the sum over complex orbits which flow into the chaotic sea , although this evaluation is still not achievable for several reasons @xcite .",
    "we further note that , for almost the same reasons , the origin of coherent oscillation is not clearly accounted for within semiclassical arguments . as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : timeevo - reso ] , the quasi - doublet state was formed between one torus state and one chaotic state when scanning system parameters .",
    "it is reasonable to suppose that some simpler form of coherence than destructive interferences generating dynamical localization could underlie complex orbits connecting torus and chaotic regions , but the mechanism invoking the observed strong resonances is not well understood .",
    "the most noteworthy consequence of the interplay between dynamical tunneling and dynamical localization is that the increase in planck s constant does not necessarily lead to the growth of tunneling rate . as planck s constant gets larger , the localization length decreases , which acts to strengthen the effect of suppression by dynamical localization .",
    "if the suppression mechanism dominates the change in the tunneling rate , a counter - intuitive change in the tunneling rate with planck s constant may happen .",
    "we verified in fig .",
    "[ fig : noscaled_l - gamma ] that such a range indeed exists .",
    "we finally discuss the sharpness of the border between torus and chaotic regions .",
    "the motivation for constructing the system so as to have sharply or clearly divided phase space was to avoid other complex problems of generic phase spaces and make the study of our tunneling problem simpler .",
    "in particular , the presence of nonlinear resonances leads to resonance assisted tunneling @xcite , an alternative mechanism enhancing the tunneling rate .",
    "conversely , cantori or broken tori play the role of partial barriers which suppress the transport @xcite .",
    "it seems possible to avoid such problems when we study a system with sharply divided phase space .",
    "this is certainly the case in classical mechanics , but as mentioned in section [ sec : diffraction ] the sharpness of the boundary , more precisely the discontinuity of kinetic or potential functions , necessarily invokes diffraction . in section [ sec :",
    "diffraction ] , we have verified that the claims given for the sharply divided case do not nevertheless need to be corrected at least in a qualitative level .",
    "however , we should recall that the underlying mechanism is quite different between diffraction and tunneling , although both concern classically forbidden processes .",
    "we need alternative semiclassical techniques to obtain quantitative results .",
    "in particular , the semiclassical evaluation employing complex classical orbits is no longer valid if the system loses analyticity .",
    "it is also frustrating that the recently proposed formula to predict a tunneling rate assumes the extension of tori of fictitious integrable system to the surrounding chaotic sea , which requires that the border between torus and chaotic regions be as sharp as possible @xcite .",
    "this alternatively means that the validity of this formula is maximally guaranteed in the strong diffraction limit .",
    "a quantitative evaluation of tunneling rate is not an easy task if we define dynamical tunneling as a process far from the diffraction limit .",
    "this issue will be dealt with in the forthcoming publication @xcite .    throughout this paper ,",
    "noise is implemented as a stochastic process .",
    "it is easy to hypothesize that analogous phenomena will occur when we employ chaotic dynamics to realize noise .",
    "thus we close this paper by raising the following question : is the spontaneous recovery of chaotic tunneling generic in multiple - dimensional systems with mixed phase space ?",
    "we show how we approximately construct a torus state , which is the initial state of our numerical experiments ( see , sec .",
    "[ sec : cat ] ) . in the torus region , the classical dynamics of the system presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : referencesystem ] is described by @xmath169 we may assume that the momentum of an invariant torus is specified by a function of @xmath14 @xmath170 namely , @xmath171 is supposed to be on a torus .",
    "after an iteration of the integrable map , the system arrives at @xmath172 , which must agree with @xmath173 by the assumption  . hence @xmath174 must satisfy the following equation @xmath175 to solve it , we expand @xmath174 as @xmath176 the functional equation   is cast into an algebraic equation of @xmath177 @xmath178 hence we have @xmath179 where an arbitrary constant @xmath71 specifies a torus .",

    "because @xmath70 must be single - valued , @xmath71 must be quantized .",
    "more precisely , @xmath46 is kept large enough so as to preserve the dynamical localization that occurs in the vicinity of the torus region when the noise term is absent . as shown in section  [ sec : expdecay ] , we have non - zero decay rate from torus to chaotic region under the presence of noise .",
    "hence , we choose @xmath46 so as to obtain the converged decay rate .    precisely speaking , @xmath55 also contains the probability at the chaotic sea near the torus .",
    "however the contribution from the chaotic sea is negligible on average , since probability in that region escapes quickly .",
    "we use the term resonance ( or off - resonance ) because the corresponding physical process is governed by the resonance of quasienergies .",
