    "quantum zeno effect ( qze ) refers to the inhabitation of the unitary time evolution of a quantum system by repeated frequent measurements @xcite .",
    "it is a phenomena which is intrinsically related to the projection postulate in quantum mechanics . for an isolated quantum system",
    ", its state vector undergoes an unitary evolution according to the schrdinger s equation . at the very beginning , the survival probability for the system to remain in the initial state changes quadratically with the elapsed time , while it decreases exponentially in a large time scale . if a measurement is performed to check whether the system is still in the initial state or not after some time , the projection postulate states that the system s state will collapse to the initial state immediately after the measurement .",
    "therefore , when successive measurements are performed at a time interval within the quadratic decaying region , the unitary evolution of the system is found to be suppressed . in the limit of continuous measurement ,",
    "the dynamic evolution of the system is frozen .",
    "the possibility of such an effect to be found in an unstable quantum system was first pointed out by fonda _",
    "_ @xcite and degasperis _ et al .",
    "they suggested that the decay rate of an unstable system may be dependent on the frequency of intermediate measurements .",
    "later , misra _ et al .",
    "_ , who gave the effect its name , presented a general formulism concerning the semigroups to analyze the qze @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the qze was first manifested in an radio - frequency transition between two laser - cooled beryllium ion ground - state levels @xcite .    in the recent decade",
    ", qze has been studied intensively within the content of quantum optics . among those analyses ,",
    "the systems under consideration are only of a few levels in which the qze can be easily observed by frequent measurements .",
    "however , little attention of the possibility to observe qze in quantum many - body systems has been paid so far .",
    "the primary motivation of our work is to investigate the qze from the viewpoint of condensed matter physics and obtain criteria on how frequent the measurements should be compared to the system size in order to preserve the qze in many - body systems .",
    "mathematically speaking , we are interested in the scaling behavior of the short time limit of the survival probability of the system s initial state under the influence of an external perturbation .",
    "we presented a general analysis and find that the leading term of the survival probability is equal to the fluctuation in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "specifically , we take the one - dimensional transverse - field ising model and the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model as examples .",
    "the leading term of the survival probability in these two models are calculated analytically and their scaling behaviors is obtained . in our analysis , we allowed these many - body models to couple to a central qubit .",
    "the significance of the central qubit is just to provide an external perturbation in the hamiltonian and allow us to study how the system s evolution is affected by the external perturbation in the short time regime .",
    "a point to note here is that the central qubit only serve as a source of external perturbation and how it evolves is not of our interest .",
    "moreover , we would like to point out that the leading term of the survival probability in our study is just the same as the linear response in the study of quench dynamics @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_formulism ] , we first present a general formulism for obtaining the survival probability of the initial state in the short - time limit .",
    "then in section [ sec_ising ] and [ sec_lmg ] , we take the one - dimensional transverse - field ising model and the lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model as examples respectively to illustrate the criteria for observing the qze , in terms of the size dependence of the leading term of the survival probability in the short - time limit .",
    "our analysis shows that in order to observe the qze , the number of measurements have to be comparable to the size of the system .",
    "finally , a summary would be given in section [ sec_sum ] .",
