    "chemical reaction dynamics are often studied with the use of rate equations for chemical concentrations . for this approach",
    ", the number of molecules is assumed to be large , which validates the continuum description .",
    "however , in a biological system such as a cell , the number of molecules within is sometimes rather small .",
    "then the validity of continuum description by the rate equations is not evident .",
    "this problem of smallness in molecule number is not restricted in biology . following recent advances in nanotechnology , reactions in a micro - reactor",
    "are studied experimentally , where the number of molecules in concern is quite small .",
    "this is also true in some surface reaction of absorbed chemicals .",
    "here we are interested in the effect of such smallness in molecule number .",
    "of course , one straightforward consequence of the smallness in the number is the large fluctuations in the concentration .",
    "indeed , the fluctuations around the continuous rate equation can be discussed by stochastic differential equation @xcite .",
    "state change by noise has been studied as noise - induced transitions @xcite , noise - induced order @xcite , stochastic resonance @xcite , and so forth .",
    "the use of stochastic differential equation , as well as its consequence , has been investigated thoroughly .",
    "if the number of molecules is much smaller and can reach 0 , however , another effect of `` smallness '' is expected , that is the discreteness in the number .",
    "our concern in the present paper is a drastic effect induced by such discreteness in the molecule number .",
    "previously we have discovered a transition of a chemical state , induced by the discreteness in the molecule number , i.e. , the effect of the number of molecules @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the transition is termed as discreteness - induced transition ( dit ) .",
    "this transition is not explained by the stochastic differential equation approach .",
    "rather , discreteness , in conjunction with the stochastic effect , is essential . in particular",
    ", we studied a system with autocatalytic reaction in a well stirred container .",
    "as the volume of the container decreases and the molecule number decreases , a transition to a novel state with symmetry breaking occurs , that does not appear either in the continuous rate equation or in its langevin version . here",
    "the transition occurs , when the number of molecule flow from environment to the reactor is discrete , in the sense that it is less than one on the average , within the average reaction time .",
    "indeed , to the discreteness - induced transition , relevant is not the molecule number itself but the discreteness in the number of some molecular process ( e.g. , flow of molecule into the system ) within the average time scale of some other reaction process .    on the other hand , in a spatially extended system with reaction and diffusion ,",
    "the total number of molecules ( and molecular events ) increases with the system size , and is not small . instead , the number of molecules ( or events ) , not in the total system but within the size of an `` effective length '' , is relevant to determine the discreteness effect",
    ". then , we need to answer what this effective length is . in @xcite",
    ", we have proposed that the so - called kuramoto length gives an answer to it .",
    "kuramoto length @xmath3 is defined as the average length that a molecule diffuses within its lifetime , i.e. , before it makes reaction with other molecules @xcite . in the seminal papers @xcite",
    ", kuramoto has shown that whether the total system size is larger than this length or not provides a condition to guarantee the use of the reaction - diffusion equation .",
    "when the system size ( length ) is smaller than @xmath3 , local fluctuations rapidly spread over the system .",
    "contrastingly , if the system size is much larger than @xmath3 , distant regions fluctuate independently , and the system is described by local reaction process and diffusion , validating the use of reaction - diffusion equation .",
    "for example , consider the reaction @xmath4 if the concentration of chemical @xmath5 is set to be constant , the chemical @xmath6 is produced at the constant rate @xmath7 , while it decays with the reaction @xmath8 at the rate @xmath9 .",
    "the average concentration of @xmath6 at the steady state is @xmath10 , where @xmath5 is the concentration of the chemical @xmath5 .",
    "thus the average lifetime of @xmath6 at the steady state is estimated to be @xmath11 . if @xmath6 molecules diffuse at the diffusion constant @xmath12 in one - dimensional space , the typical length over which an @xmath6 molecule diffuses in its lifetime is estimated to be @xmath13 which gives the kuramoto length .    in these works",
    ", it is assumed that the average distance between molecules is much smaller than @xmath3 , and there is a large number of molecules within the region of the length @xmath3 .",
    "thus the concentration of the chemical @xmath6 can be regarded as a continuous variable .",
    "hence the continuum description is valid .",
    "however , if the average distance between molecules is comparable to or larger than @xmath3 , local discreteness of molecules may not be negligible .",
    "for example , consider a chemical species @xmath14 , whose kuramoto length is given by @xmath15 .",
    "then we consider discreteness of molecule species @xmath16 that produces this chemical @xmath14 , i.e. , the case that average number of @xmath16 is less than 1 within the area of the kuramoto length @xmath15 . with this setting , molecules @xmath17 , produced by @xmath16 molecules ,",
    "will be localized around them , as the average distance between @xmath16 molecules is larger than the kuramoto length of @xmath14 .",
    "then , this localization of the chemical may drastically alter the total rate of the reactions , if reactions with 2nd or higher order of @xmath17 are involved , as will be shown later . in the present paper , following @xcite , we pursue the possibility that discreteness of some molecules within kuramoto length of some other molecules may drastically change the steady state of the system , as in dit previously studied .    in section 2",
    ", we discuss a general condition for the amplification of some reaction by such discreteness .",
    "then by introducing a self - consistent equation for the rate of this amplification , we demonstrate the existence of stable stochastic steady state ( sss ) , that never appears in the continuum description . in section 3",
    ", we numerically study a specific chemical reaction model with three components , to show the validity of this self - consistent theory for sss . in section 4 ,",
    "domain formation with this sss is presented , as a novel possibility for pattern formation in reaction - diffusion system .",
    "discussion is given in section 5 , with possible applications to biological problems .",
    "consider a reaction system consisting of several molecule species @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , with chemical reaction and diffusion .",
    "the system can involve catalytic reactions of higher - order catalysis or autocatalysis .",
    "some other molecules ( e.g. , resource chemicals ) are supplied externally , involved in the reaction among @xmath18 , so that the nonequilibrium condition is sustained .",
    "so far the system in concern is rather general chemical reaction system with diffusion .",
    "now , we take a pair of molecule species , @xmath20 and @xmath14 , where @xmath14 is produced by @xmath20 , and study how the discreteness of the molecule @xmath20 can alter the steady state from the continuum limit case . to discuss the discreteness effect , we consider the case that the molecule @xmath14 is localized around the molecule @xmath20 .",
    "( recall the molecule @xmath14 is produced by @xmath20 . ) in order for this localization to work , the average length that the molecule @xmath14 travels within its lifetime should be smaller than the average distance of the molecules @xmath20 . in other words ,",
    "the average number of the molecules @xmath20 within the domain of the kuramoto length @xmath21 is less than 1 .",
    "( see fig .",
    ", the lifetime of the molecule @xmath14 is determined by the collision with some other molecule species whose density is not low .",
    "hence , the kuramoto length of the @xmath14 molecule , determined as in  1 , is given independently of the concentrations of the molecules @xmath20 and @xmath14 .",
    "now , to alter drastically the steady state by discreteness , the localization of @xmath14 molecule has to change concentrations of some other molecules , as compared with the case of homogeneous distribution of @xmath14 .",
    "this is possible if there is a higher - order reaction such as @xmath22 , because the probability of such reaction is amplified by localization of @xmath14 molecules in space . to compute this acceleration",
    ", we calculate the average of @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the concentration of @xmath17 , and compute the degree of amplification @xmath25 from that for the homogeneously distributed case . in the calculation",
    ", we assume that @xmath17 is localized around the @xmath16 molecules , with a width of @xmath21 , the kuramoto length of @xmath17 ( which is shorter than the average distance between @xmath16 molecules ) .    assuming that the distribution of @xmath17 is represented by the continuous concentration @xmath26",
    ", @xmath25 can be expressed as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the size ( volume ) of the system .    for simplicity , we assume that @xmath16 is randomly distributed over @xmath29-dimensional space , and the distribution of @xmath17 is given by a @xmath29-dimensional gaussian distribution with a standard deviation @xmath30 around each @xmath16 molecule , such as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the position of each @xmath16 molecule .",
    "now @xmath26 is the sum of @xmath33 ; thus , @xmath34 since @xmath35 . for the case with @xmath36 and sufficiently large @xmath28 , @xmath37 since",
    "@xmath16 is randomly distributed . with eq .",
    "( [ eqn : alpha0 ] ) , @xmath38 thus , we obtain the acceleration factor @xmath39 in the same manner , for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and generally , for @xmath42 , @xmath43 as shown , the reaction can be drastically amplified as the number of @xmath20 molecules within a volume of the kuramoto length ( @xmath44 ) is much smaller than 1 .",
    "so far we have shown that for reaction system involving the process from @xmath20 to @xmath14 , the discreteness can alter the concentration of some chemicals drastically , if ( 1 ) the density of @xmath20 molecule is so low that the number is discrete within the size of the kuramoto length of @xmath14 molecule and ( 2 ) there is a high order ( higher than linear ) reaction with regards to @xmath14 .    next , to confirm that this acceleration of reaction alters the steady state from the continuum case , we need to check if the condition for the discreteness is sustained under the above amplification of concentration of some chemicals , as a steady state solution .",
    "hence we study some feedback from the concentration of @xmath45 to @xmath20 that is generated by some reaction path(s ) .",
    "if @xmath20 is produced or catalyzed by @xmath45 , the concentration of @xmath20 depends on that of @xmath45 , @xmath46 . with such feedback",
    ", the change of concentration @xmath47 is given by some function @xmath48 , while the change of the concentration @xmath49 depends on @xmath47 , and is given by some function as @xmath50 . since @xmath46 is a function of @xmath51 , @xmath48 is rewritten as @xmath52 .",
    "hence the concentrations of @xmath20 and @xmath14 molecules must satisfy @xmath53 ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 may have dependence on other concentrations or reaction rates , e.g. , @xmath50 can also depend on @xmath49 or @xmath25 ) .",
    "the steady state solution is obtained by setting the right hand of these equations as 0 .",
    "note that the solution with @xmath56 corresponds to the continuum case , given by the standard rate equation .",
    "for some case , this is the only solution for the concentrations . for some other cases ,",
    "however , there is some other solution(s ) with @xmath57 .",
    "this is a solution with the amplification by localization of molecules due to the discreteness of the @xmath20 molecule .",
    "if the concentration of @xmath47 obtained from this solution satisfies @xmath58 , this discreteness - induced solution is self - consistent .",
    "furthermore , the stability of this solution is computed by linearizing the solution around this fixed point . if this solution is linearly stable , stability of this novel steady solution is assured , which does not exist in the continuum description ( or in its langevin equation version ) .",
    "we call the state represented by this solution as stochastic steady state ( sss ) , as it is sustained stochastically through discreteness in molecule numbers",
    ". we will show an explicit example of this sss in the next section .",
    "so far we have assumed that the kuramoto - length @xmath15 of the @xmath14 molecule is constant .",
    "this is true as long as the concentration of the molecule relevant to the decomposition or transformation of the @xmath14 molecule is constant .",
    "however , if the concentration of the chemical that is relevant to the determination of @xmath21 depends on the concentration of either @xmath20 , @xmath14 , or @xmath45 , the kuramoto length , as well as @xmath25 , depends on it . accordingly , in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cicj ] ) , we need to regard @xmath21 in @xmath25 as a variable that depends on either @xmath47 , @xmath49 or @xmath25 . with the inclusion of the dependence",
    ", we again obtain a self - consistent solution , to get the concentrations @xmath47 and @xmath49 ( and accordingly @xmath25 and @xmath21 ) . if there is a stable solution with @xmath59 and @xmath58",
    ", then we get a sss as a self - consistent solution both on @xmath25 and @xmath21 .",
    "we will discuss a related example in  4 , where two solutions with @xmath56 and @xmath59 coexist in space , and form a domain structure .",
    "so far we have discussed a simple case of discreteness - induced state .",
    "the discussion with the use of amplification factor @xmath25 , however , is generalized to include temporally or spatially dependent solutions of @xmath47 and @xmath49 , with temporal ( or spatial ) dependence of @xmath25 .",
    "this solution represents an average behavior longer than the time scale for stochastic collisions or longer scale than @xmath21 . with this extension",
    ", we can discuss discreteness - induced rhythm or pattern , that is stochastically sustained .",
    "such spatiotemporal dynamics can often appear in a reaction network of several molecules , with two or more pairs of discreteness in number .",

    "[ fig : sp1-cascade - loop ] ) , where we assume that the density @xmath66 , @xmath67 , of @xmath68 and @xmath69 molecules are so low that @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively for the kuramoto lengths of @xmath72 and @xmath73 . then",
    ", following the scheme we discussed , we get a coupled equation for the concentrations of @xmath66 , @xmath74 , @xmath67 , @xmath75 with two amplification factors @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in general",
    ", there may be a time- or space- dependent solution",
    "( by including diffusion term with much longer spatial scale ) , that leads to a novel stochastic pattern or rhythm .",
    "explicit examples for such case will be discussed in future .",

    "for example , in a randomly connected catalytic reaction network , there often exist several fixed points with some chemicals going extinct , when the number of molecules is small , while there is only one attractor in the continuum limit .",
    "these discreteness - induced states may coexist in space in a similar way as discussed above .",
    "kuramoto length will be a useful index to determine the behavior around the border of the regions .        .",
    "@xmath156 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath188 , and @xmath189 . for small @xmath12",
    ", there appears a broad peak at the wave length around the order of @xmath190 , which corresponds to the interval of the spots . for large @xmath12 ,",
    "@xmath87 spreads over the space , and the peak disappears.,width=302 ]",
    "in the present paper , we have reported a novel steady state in a system with reaction and diffusion , induced by discreteness in molecules .",
    "this state can not be represented by a continuum description , i.e. , partial differential equation ( reaction - diffusion equation ) , but is sustained by amplification of some reaction due to localization of some molecule @xmath14 .",
    "this localization is possible if the molecule species that produce @xmath14 is `` discrete '' , in the sense that its average number within the kuramoto length of the @xmath14 molecule is less than 1 .",
    "we have formulated a theory to obtain a self - consistent solution for the concentrations of @xmath20 and @xmath14 , in relationship with the amplification rate of the reaction involved with @xmath14 . for some reaction system",
    ", there is a solution with amplification rate larger than 1 , that leads to the existence of stochastic steady state due to the discreteness in molecule number .",
    "the stability of this solution is also computed within this theoretical formulation .",
    "we have also numerically studied a simple reaction - diffusion system to demonstrate the validity of the theory . indeed , a novel stochastic steady state is observed , as predicted theoretically .",
    "we have also extended our theory to include the self - consistent determination of the kuramoto length . following this extension ,",
    "we have provided a numerical example , to show formation of domains with different kuramoto lengths .      1 .",
    "chemical @xmath20 generates another chemical species @xmath14 .",
    "the lifetime of @xmath14 is short or the diffusion of @xmath14 is slow so that the kuramoto length of @xmath14 is much smaller than the distance between @xmath16 molecules .",
    "the localization of the molecule @xmath14 accelerates some reactions .",
    "then , the discreteness can alter the dynamics , from that by the continuum description .",
    "the last condition is satisfied if the second or higher order reaction is involved in the species @xmath14 .",
    "finally , if        note that the localization effect by the discreteness of catalytic molecules itself is also noted by shnerb _",
    "_ @xcite . in their study , however , the density of the catalyst is fixed as an externally given value .",
    "thus the concentration of the product , localized around the catalyst , diverges in time . in our theory",
    ", the density of the catalyst ( @xmath20 ) changes autonomously and reaches a suitable value by following the discreteness effect .",
    "the self - consistent solution scheme to obtain this discreteness - induced stochastic state can be extended to a case with several components @xmath191 , and the corresponding set of chemicals @xmath192 satisfying the conditions ( i)(iii ) . in such case ,",
    "the feedback process in ( iv ) is not necessarily direct from @xmath193 to @xmath194 .",
    "if there is a feedback from the set of chemicals @xmath192 to the set @xmath191 ( condition ( iv)@xmath195 ) , the above scheme for the self - consistent dynamics we presented here works . with this extension",
    ", there is a variety of possibilities , that can lead to stochastic rhythm or pattern formation induced by discreteness of molecules , which is not seen in the continuum limit .",
    "for example , in a catalytic reaction network with many components and a limited number of total molecules , there always exist several species that are minority in number , and the conditions ( i)(ii ) are naturally satisfied , while with higher order catalytic reaction the condition ( iii ) is often satisfied . in this case ,",
    "minority molecules become a key factor to determine a macroscopic state with rhythm or pattern .",
    "( note in this case , other molecules can be abundant in number , or indeed it is better to have such abundant species , so that the stochastic state is stabilized . )    in fact , biochemical reaction networks involve a huge number of species , while the total number of molecules is not necessarily so large . in a cell ,",
    "lots of chemicals work at low concentration in the order of 1 nm or less .",
    "the diffusion is sometimes restricted , surrounded by macro - molecules , and may be slow .",
    "in such an environment , it is probable that the average distance between the molecules of a given chemical species is much larger than the kuramoto lengths of some other chemical species .",
    "some chemicals are localized around some other molecules .",
    "furthermore , biochemical systems contain various higher order reactions ( for example , catalyzed by enzyme complexes ) . in conjunction with the localization",
    ", such reactions can be accelerated .",
    "hence the conditions ( i)(iii ) are ubiquitously satisfied in intra - cellular biochemical reaction networks . in addition , since the biochemical reactions involve complex feedback process through mutual catalytic networks , the condition ( iv ) or ( iv)@xmath195 is naturally satisfied .    accordingly",
    ", it will be important to study the amplification of some reaction and its maintenance through feedback will be relevant to biochemical reactions .",
    "indeed , some molecules that are minority in number sometimes play a key role in biological function .",
    "relevance of minority molecules is also discussed from the viewpoint on a control mechanism of a cell , in relationship with the kinetic origin of information @xcite .",
    "the importance of our theory is not restricted to biological problems .",
    "verification of our result will be possible by suitably designing a reaction system , with the use of , say , microreactors or vesicles .",
    "the acceleration and maintenance of some reactions by localization of molecules will be important to design some function in such micro - reactor systems .",
    "the present paper is dedicated to professor yoshiki kuramoto on the occasion of his retirement from kyoto university . with the papers @xcite that introduced kuramoto length a novel research field",
    "was opened ; the study of chemical wave and turbulence with the use of _ continuous , deterministic _ reaction - diffusion equation .",

    "<S> a self - consistent equation to derive a discreteness - induced stochastic steady state is presented for reaction - diffusion systems . for this formalism , we use the so - called kuramoto length , a typical distance over which a molecule diffuses in its lifetime , as was originally introduced to determine if local fluctuations influence globally the whole system . </S>",

    "<S> when this acceleration influences the concentration of the original molecule species , it is shown that a novel , stochastic steady state is induced that does not appear in the continuum limit . a theory to obtain and characterize this state is introduced , based on the self - consistent equation for chemical concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> this stochastic steady state is confirmed by numerical simulations on a certain reaction model , which agrees well with the theoretical estimation . </S>",
