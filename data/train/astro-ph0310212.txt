    "recent observations of clusters of galaxies at intermediate - redshift ( @xmath17 ) demonstrated that environmental processes play an important role on both the star - formation activity and the morphology of galaxies ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "1997 ; balogh et al . 1998 ; poggianti et al . 1999",
    "; moss & whittle 2000 ) . the galaxy evolution in such clusters",
    "may be explained as the result of the increased activity of the field galaxies at more distant redshift ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ) , modulated by changing the infall rate onto the clusters ( bower 1991 ) .",
    "however , little information on the global star formation history in such intermediate - redshift clusters has been obtained even to date .    in many previous spectroscopic studies such as the canadian network for observational cosmology ( cnoc ) and morphs surveys ( e.g. , abraham et al .",
    "1996 ; poggianti et al . 1999 ) , the [ o ii]@xmath18 emission line has often been used to investigate the star formation activity in cluster galaxies .",
    "however , the h@xmath9 emission line provides a more reliable indicator of star formation because it is less sensitive both to dust extinction and to metallicty effects ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "recently , an h@xmath9 survey has been made for nearby clusters of galaxies abell 1367 and coma ( iglesias - pramo et al .",
    "these data are utilized to derive the h@xmath9 luminosity function ( lf ) of the cluster member galaxies .",
    "optical spectroscopic surveys are also useful in studying h@xmath9 emission - line properties of cluster member galaxies ( balogh et al . 2002 ; couch et al .",
    "however , such spectroscopic sample are selected by using optical broad - band color properties , being independent from their h@xmath9 emission - line properties .",
    "therefore , these data sets may miss a part of h@xmath9-emitting galaxies that are too faint to be selected in a continuum - magnitude - limited sample . in order to determine the shape of the h@xmath9 lf unambiguously",
    ", it is required to carry out a deeper h@xmath9 imaging survey .",
    "motivated by this , we performed our deep h@xmath9 imaging survey of a cluster of galaxies , abell 521 at @xmath0 which is a relatively rich ( richness class 1 ) cluster ; note that its bautz - morgan type is iii ( abell , corwin , & olowin 1989 ) .",
    "recent studies of this cluster showed that the projected galaxy density distribution in the central region has a very anisotropic morphology , as it exhibits two high - density filaments crossing in an x - shaped structure at the barycenter of the cluster ( arnaud et al .",
    "2000 ; maurogordato et al . 2000 ; ferrari et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the observed high velocity dispersion of the cluster ( @xmath19 1325 km s@xmath14 ) may be attributed to the presence of those substructures . since",
    "this velocity dispersion is also high compared to that expected from the temperature of the x - ray gas ( @xmath20 kev , arnaud et al .",
    "2000 ) , it is suggested that this cluster is undergoing strong dynamical evolution driven by mergers among substructures . in this paper , we present observational properties of h@xmath9-emitting galaxies in abell 521 and then derive the h@xmath9 lf for the first time . throughout this paper ,",
    "magnitudes are given in the ab system ( fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1995 ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath21 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 cosmology , for comparison with previous results in the literature .",
    "the imaging data of abell 521 were obtained with suprime - cam ( miyazaki et al . 2002 ) on the 8.2 m subaru telescope atop mauna kea during two runs ( 2001 october and 2002 february ) .",
    "we used the narrow - band filter , @xmath4 ( @xmath24  and  @xmath6 ) ; the central wavelength corresponds to a redshift of @xmath25 for h@xmath9 emission .",
    "we also used broad - band filters , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath8 .",
    "a journal of our observations is summarized in table [ obs ] .",
    "we used iraf and the mosaic - ccd data reduction software , nekosoft ( yagi et al .",
    "2002 ) , to reduce and combine the individual ccd data .",
    "photometric and spectrophotometric standard stars used for the flux calibration are as follows ; sa98 ( landolt 1992 ) for the @xmath26 data , sa95 and sa98 ( landolt 1992 ) for the @xmath27 data , sa95 , sa113 , and pg0231 ( landolt 1992 ) for the @xmath28 data , gd50 ( oke 1990 ) for the @xmath29 data , and gd50 , gd108 , and pg1034 + 001 ( stone 1996 ) for the @xmath4 data .",
    "since the zero point of landolt ( 1992 ) is based on vega , we convert the @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 magnitudes to the ab system assuming monotonic colors of @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 ( fukugita et al . 1995 ) . for @xmath29 and @xmath4 , we multiplied the atmospheric , instrumental , and filter transmittance , mirror reflectivity and ccd quantum efficiency with the sed of standard stars to calculated absolute flux .",
    "the @xmath8 data were calibrated by using the magnitude of the quasar sdssp j104433.04012502.2 ( fan et al .",
    "2000 ) , which were obtained in the same observing night ( see fujita et al .",
    "since any quasar is a potentially variable object , the photometric calibration of the @xmath8 data may be more unreliable than those of the other band data . in order to estimate the uncertainty , we compared the colors of stars in our area with galactic stars given by gunn & stryker and applied the correction to our @xmath8 data . the combined images for the individual bands were aligned and smoothed with gaussian kernels to match the psf ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the final images cover an area of 32 @xmath34 20 arcmin@xmath2 , which corresponds to 9.4 @xmath34 5.8 mpc@xmath2 at @xmath0 .",
    "source detection and photometry were performed by using sextractor version 2.2.2 ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "the @xmath4 image was used as a reference image for detection , and photometry was performed for each band image .",
    "we used a criterion that a source has at least a 13-pixel connection at @xmath35 level . for each object , we measured the magnitude within a fixed aperture of a @xmath36 ( @xmath19 15 kpc at @xmath0 ) diameter for colors and the magnitudes in all 6 band images .",
    "however , we used an adaptive aperture of diameter @xmath37 for measurement of total magnitudes , where @xmath38 is the kron radius ( kron 1980 ) .",
    "our @xmath39 within a @xmath40 aperture in each band is given in table 1 .    in order to correct for the galactic extinction , we calculated the extinction at each band ( cardelli et al .",
    "1989 ) , assuming that @xmath41 ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 , ned ) .",
    "the extinction at each band , @xmath42 , is given in table 1 .",
    "we defined the off - band continuum flux of objects as @xmath43 , which was computed from a linear interpolation between the effective frequencies of the @xmath29 and @xmath8 bands . taking the scatter in the @xmath44 color into account ,",
    "emission - line objects were selected with the following criteria , @xmath45 the color of @xmath46 corresponds to an equivalent width of @xmath47  in the rest frame at @xmath48 .",
    "the magnitude limit corresponds to the @xmath39 of the @xmath49 band .",
    "these criteria are shown by the solid , dashed , and dotted lines in figure [ iznb - nb ] .",
    "then we found 324 objects that satisfy the above criteria ; note that they are brighter than the limiting magnitude at each band .",
    "a narrow band imaging can potentially detect galaxies with different emission lines at different redshifts .",
    "emission lines detected in our narrow - band imaging survey are , for example , h@xmath9 ( @xmath50 ) , [ o iii]@xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , h@xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , and [ o ii]@xmath18 ( @xmath55 ) . in order to distinguish h@xmath9 emitters at @xmath50 from other emission - line objects , we investigate their broad - band color properties . in figure",
    "[ bv - vi ] , we show the diagram between @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the 324 emission - line objects .",
    "we also show the model galaxy colors that estimated by using the population synthesis model gissel96 ( bruzual & charlot 1993 ) . the star formation rate of model galaxies is proportional to @xmath58 , where we use @xmath59 gyr . changing the age of model galaxies",
    ", we generate the seds of five types of galaxies [ @xmath60 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 8 gyr for sb ( young starburst ) , irr , scd , sbc , and e , respectively ] .",
    "then we find that h@xmath9 emitters at @xmath50 can be selected by adopting the following color criterion , @xmath61 as shown in figure 2 , this criterion appears to isolate h@xmath9 emitters from other emitters at different redshifts .",
    "we then obtain a sample of 165 h@xmath9 emitters .    in order to examine whether or not this color criterion works well more quantitatively , we investigate color properties of the spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies in abell 521 .",
    "the previous spectroscopic surveys identified 125 member galaxies in this cluster ( ferrari et al .",
    "2003 ; maurogordato et al",
    "these members are identified in our catalog .",
    "we found that 123 objects satisfy the color criterion based on our photometry .",
    "the remaining two objects were rejected in our selection procedure because they have neighboring galaxies , causing large photometric errors . as a further check",
    ", we examined the spatial distribution of the galaxies which are selected by the above color criterion . in figure",
    "[ density ] , the excess of surface number density by the cluster members is clearly seen in the area within the radial distance of 2 mpc from the center of abell 521 ; note that the center is taken at the position of the main x - ray cluster ( arnaud et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in order to investigate the detection completeness of h@xmath9 emitters",
    ", we performed a detection test on simulated artificial images .",
    "we prepared model galaxies with broad - band colors of late type galaxies ( sb , irr , scd , and sbc ) at @xmath62 generated by gissel96 model . since the equivalent width of h@xmath9 emission is generally different form galaxy to galaxy , we put the excess of @xmath4 to @xmath49 continuum as a parameter .",
    "we studied a color range of @xmath63 with five bins of @xmath64 . since the total magnitude of @xmath4 is another parameter , we studied a magnitude range of @xmath65 with twelve bins of @xmath66 .",
    "we prepared 500 model galaxies in each set of @xmath4 and @xmath67 .",
    "the light distribution of model galaxies is generated as the exponential law by iraf artdata .",
    "their sky positions , half - light radius ( 1 to 7 kpc ) , and ellipticities ( 0.3 to 1.0 ) were randomly set and put into the ccd data together with poisson noises . after smoothing model - galaxy images to match to the seeing size",
    ", we tried to detect them using sextractor and to select as h@xmath9 emitters with the same procedure as that used for the observed data .",
    "the detectability of the model emitters is shown in figure [ comp ] as a function of @xmath4 magnitude .",
    "we found that the detectability is higher than 80% for objects with @xmath68 , but lower than 30% for objects with @xmath69 .",
    "next , we examined the contamination by emission - line objects at other redshifts ( e.g. , [ o iii]@xmath70 at @xmath71 ) in the same manner as that for the detection completeness estimate .",
    "we found the contamination to be only less than 5% even for the faint objects with @xmath69 . in conclusion ,",
    "our color criterion allows us to select reliable h@xmath9 emitters at @xmath50 for sources with @xmath72 .",
    "at first we derive the emission - line equivalent width of the individual h@xmath9 emitters .",
    "since the pass band of our narrow - band filter is too wide to separate [ n ii]@xmath73 from h@xmath9 , the equivalent with derived here is that contributed from the three emission lines .",
    "we adopt the same method as that used by pascual et al .",
    "( 2001 ) to calculate h@xmath9 + [ n ii]@xmath74 ( hereafter h@xmath9 + [ n ii ] ) equivalent width .",
    "the flux density in each filter can be expressed as the sum of the line flux and the continuum density ( the line is covered by both filters ) , @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the continuum flux density , @xmath77 the line flux , @xmath78 and @xmath79 the @xmath4 and @xmath29 band filter effective widths , respectively , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 the flux density in each filter . then the equivalent width can be expressed as follows ; @xmath82 )   = \\frac{f_{\\rm l}}{f_{\\rm c } } = \\delta nb \\left [ \\frac{f_{nb } - f_{i^\\prime z^\\prime}}{f_{i^\\prime z^\\prime } - 0.6   f_{nb } ( \\delta nb / \\delta i^\\prime ) } \\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath83  for the @xmath29 band and @xmath84  for the @xmath4 band .      in order to obtain the h@xmath9 luminosity",
    ", we have to correct for the flux contribution from the [ n ii ] doublet .",
    "we also have to apply correction for internal extinction .",
    "for the two corrections , we adopt the flux ratio of h@xmath9/[n ii ] = 2.3 ( kennicutt 1992 ) and @xmath85 mag as a typical internal extinction at @xmath86 ( tresse & maddox 1998 ) . applying these corrections",
    ", we estimate the h@xmath9 luminosity , @xmath87 , from the total magnitude for each objects .",
    "we then obtain the star formation rate , @xmath88 , using the following relation ( kennicutt 1998 ) , @xmath89    the net h@xmath9 flux depends on the source redshift because of the fixed transmittance of our @xmath4 filter . in order to correct for this effect",
    ", we adopt the following assumptions .",
    "( 1 ) the velocity ( redshift ) distribution of the cluster galaxies is a gaussian probability density function @xmath90 around a mean velocity of 74019 km s@xmath14 with a dispersion of 1325 km s@xmath14 ( ferrari et al . 2003 ) .",
    "( 2 ) the equivalent width distribution of the h@xmath9 emitters in the rest frame is expressed as the following exponential functional form ; @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath26 are free parameters .",
    "then , the rest frame equivalent width probability of the h@xmath9 emitters at redshift @xmath93 can be expressed as @xmath94 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are obtained so as to fit the distribution of @xmath44 .",
    "we apply the correction for the incomplete velocity coverage of the @xmath4 filter .",
    "since the number of the h@xmath9 emitters excluded from the filter can be calculated from the value of the equivalent width , we correct the equivalent width distribution function that derived above .",
    "therefore , using the equivalent width distribution function , we obtain the corrected h@xmath9 luminosity distribution .",
    "since the excess of surface galaxy density by the cluster member is clearly seen in the area within 2 mpc radius ( see figure 3 ) , it seems safe to use the h@xmath9 emitters located in the region ; note that there are 53 h@xmath9 emitters in this region .",
    "although the @xmath4 filter corresponds to the redshifted h@xmath9 emission line at @xmath95 , the mean redshift of the cluster is @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , our h@xmath9 emitter sample may suffer contamination from field h@xmath9 emitters , in particular from field galaxies in the foreground . in order to correct for this effect",
    ", we estimate the field contamination by the following method .    in order to obtain a sample of field galaxies",
    ", we use an area of 3 mpc outside from the cluster center , taking account that the virial radius is estimated to be 2.74 mpc ( girardi & mezzetti 2001 ) .",
    "however , since a subclump is seen to the north - east at about 4.5 mpc from the cluster center , we exclude this area from our analysis . the remaining sky area is used to estimate the surface number density of field galaxies as a function of @xmath4 magnitude .",
    "since abell 521 shows elongated galaxy distribution ( ferrari et al . 2003 ) , we use the local surface number density , which is calculated from 10 nearest neighbors , rather than the radial surface number density distribution . in this way ,",
    "all h@xmath9 emitters in the cluster region are weighted by the luminosity - dependent factor , @xmath96 and the density - dependent factor , @xmath97 , after renormalizing @xmath97 so that the sum of the total galaxy weights , @xmath98 is equal to the sum of @xmath96 .",
    "we derive the h@xmath9 luminosity function ( lf ) for the cluster region . in order to normalize the h@xmath9 lf to a proper volume",
    ", we use the sphere volume within 2 mpc radius .",
    "the h@xmath9 lf for our sample is well fitted by the schechter ( 1976 ) function ; @xmath99 the size of the bins is taken to be @xmath100 .",
    "the number counts in the individual bins are given in table [ count ] , and figure [ hae_lf1 ] shows the h@xmath9 lf for abell 521 and its schechter fit . after correcting for the detection completeness ( see section 3 ) , we obtain the best - fit parameters for the cluster membership within 2 mpc radius are @xmath101 the inset panel in figure [ hae_lf1 ] shows the @xmath102 error contours corresponding to the 1 and 2@xmath103 levels . it can be seen that @xmath9 and @xmath15 values are highly correlated .",
    "in figure [ hae_lf1 ] , we also show the h@xmath9 lfs of field galaxies in the local universe ( gallego et al . 1995 ) , at @xmath86 ( tresse & maddox 1998 ) , at @xmath50 ( fujita et al .",
    "2003 ) , and those of the nearby clusters of galaxies ( iglesias - pramo et al 2002 ) . as for the nearby clusters of galaxies , iglesias - pramo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) derived the h@xmath9 lfs for abell 1367 and coma ( richness class 2 ) .",
    "the physical areas analysed by them are nearly the same as that of abell 521 .",
    "although they applied a slightly different extinction correction ; @xmath104 mag for type scd or earlier and @xmath105 for type sd or later ( boselli et al .",
    "2001 ) , they obtained @xmath106 and @xmath107 erg s@xmath14 for these clusters .",
    "the inset panel in this figure shows the best - fit parameters of abell 521 and the others .",
    "there is the significant difference in h@xmath9 lfs between the clusters and the fields .",
    "it is found that the faint end slope , @xmath9 , of the h@xmath9 lf of abell 521 is flatter than that of the field h@xmath9 lfs at the same redshift .",
    "therefore , although the sample analysed here is not so large , it appears that the flatter faint end slope of the h@xmath9 lf is commonly seen in the clusters of galaxies between @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the most important finding in this study is that the characteristic luminosity , @xmath15 of abell 521 is @xmath19 6 times ( or @xmath19 2 mag ) brighter than those of the local cluster h@xmath9 lfs , and nearly the same as those of the field h@xmath9 lfs .",
    "the evolution of the field h@xmath9 lf from @xmath109 to @xmath108 appears closely related to the @xmath110 parameter rather than to the @xmath15 and @xmath9 parameters .",
    "however , as for the cluster h@xmath9 lfs , the @xmath15 parameter appears to evolve strongly from @xmath109 to @xmath108 .",
    "furthermore , we investigate the following galaxy clusters for which spectroscopic h@xmath9 emitter surveys were already made ; abell 1689 at @xmath111 ( balogh et al .",
    "2002 ) and ac 114 at @xmath112 ( couch et al .",
    "since their observations are based on spectroscopy , it is difficult to compare with our h@xmath9 lf straightforwardly .",
    "therefore , we compare the h@xmath9 lf of abell 521 with the other clusters , only using the h@xmath9 luminous galaxies ( @xmath113 erg s@xmath14 ) . it should be noted that the same dust extinction correction ( i.e. , @xmath114 mag ) is applied for these clusters , and the h@xmath9 luminosity from spectroscopy may be underestimated due to aperture bias .",
    "figure [ hae_lf2 ] shows the surface density of h@xmath9 luminosity distribution of each cluster ; note that the surface density is used instead of the volume density which is used in figure 5 , to compare simply with previous results .",
    "although there are some galaxies whose @xmath88s exceed @xmath115 yr@xmath14 in abell 521 and abell 1689 , no such galaxies are found in abell 1367 and coma .",
    "this @xmath88 is about the same level as that observed in the milky way ( rana 1991 ) .",
    "this result implies that abell 521 and abell 1689 contain more active star - forming galaxies than the nearby clusters .",
    "however , ac 114 has nearly the same property in the h@xmath9 lf as those of the nearby clusters in spite of its higher redshift .",
    "this evolution may simply reflect the butcher - oemler ( bo ) effect , which is the increase in the fraction of blue galaxies , presumably star - forming galaxies , in clusters with increasing redshift ( butcher & oemler 1984 ) .",
    "in fact , the fraction of blue galaxies in our h@xmath9 emitters by the definition of butcher & oemler ( 1984 ) is @xmath116 85% .",
    "the blue fraction , @xmath117 , in abell 1689 is comparable to that of abell 521 ( @xmath118 , see for details appendix ) and much higher than those in the nearby rich clusters such as coma ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "ac 114 and abell 1367 also have a large fraction of blue galaxies ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "therefore , the star formation activity in clusters of galaxies may not be understood solely by the bo effect .",
    "these results suggest that some physical processes work in their star formation activity , independent of the blue fraction of each cluster .",
    "we investigated what parameter of cluster correlates with the existence of high @xmath88 galaxies .",
    "one possible parameter is the dynamical status , as pointed out by balogh et al .",
    "although abell 1689 appears to show a round shape in x - ray , the observed radial velocity distributions of the cluster shows substructures . on the other hand ,",
    "ac 114 appears to be relaxed dynamically , although the cluster member galaxies shows an elongated morphology ( balogh et al .",
    "therefore , it seems important to investigate the radial velocity distributions for the h@xmath9 emitters of each cluster ( figure [ vr_dist ] ) . in this figures ,",
    "we use the relative radial velociy , @xmath121 , to the systemic velocity , @xmath122 , of each cluster , and @xmath123 is shown in the left corners of each figure . for abell 521 , abell 1367 , and coma ,",
    "their redshift are unknown from their imaging survey , since the h@xmath9 emitters are detected using the narrow - band filters .",
    "therefore , their distributions are shown using available spectroscopic data in the literature ( ferrari et al .",
    "2003 ; iglesias - pramo et al .",
    "2002 ; cortese et al .",
    "the vertical dashed lines in this figures show the velocity coverage corresponding to the @xmath124 of the narrow - band filters . for abell 521 , in particular ,",
    "since some h@xmath9 emitters with @xmath125 km s@xmath14 may be excluded from the filter transmittance , we also show the velocity distribution of galaxies identified with other emission lines ( [ ] or h@xmath53 ) taken from ferrari et al .",
    "it is found that this radial velocity distribution is consistent with that of the h@xmath9 emitters with @xmath126 km s@xmath14 .",
    "therefore , we expect that it also traces that of the h@xmath9 emitters with @xmath125 km s@xmath14 . in this figure ,",
    "the radial velocity distribution for the h@xmath9 emitters in abell 521 is inconsistent with a gaussian distribution which we assumed in section 4.1 .",
    "however , since the spectroscopic sample is rather small , it is dangerous to apply this distribution to our sample . even if this distribution is valid",
    ", it does not change the result that @xmath15 of abell 521 is much brighter than those of the nearby clusters .    in figure [ vr_dist ] ,",
    "the radial velocity distributions in abell 1367 and coma tend to be concentrated around @xmath127 km s@xmath14 .",
    "therefore , it is suggested that these galaxies are associated with a galaxy population in the cluster core , probably a virialized system . for ac 114",
    ", the radial velocity distribution suggests that the most h@xmath9 emitters are associated with the structure centered at @xmath128 km s@xmath14 . even if they comprise a substructure infalling on to the cluster center , the star - forming activity seems to have already been ceasing by the environment effect ( kodama et al .",
    "2001 ; gmez et al .",
    "abell 521 and abell 1689 show that the radial velocity distributions show several peaks in a wide velocity range , and there are few h@xmath9 emitters at the mean cluster redshifts . and for abell 521 , they are not thought to be field contamination but be associated with the cluster , since their number density is high at the center of the cluster ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the h@xmath9 emitters in the two clusters are likely to be in the process of accretion of the field population .",
    "if this is the case , we may explain why their star - forming activities are higher than those of the other clusters .",
    "it is thus suggested that the star formation activity in clusters seems to be strongly related to the dynamical status of the clusters .",
