    "primordial molecules are thought to play a fundamental role in the early universe , when stellar nucleosynthesis has not yet enriched the interstellar medium . after the decoupling of matter and radiation , the molecular radiative processes , and the formation of h@xmath5 , hd and lih contribute significantly to the thermal evolution of the medium ( e.g. puy et al 1993 , haiman , rees & loeb 1996 ) . even at the present time",
    ", it would be essential to detect such primordial molecules , to trace h@xmath5 in the low - metallicity regions ( e.g. pfenniger & combes 1994 , combes & pfenniger 1997 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the first transition of hd is at very high frequency ( 2.7 thz ) , and the first lih line , although only at 444 ghz , is not accessible from the ground at @xmath6 due to h@xmath5o atmospheric absorption .",
    "this has to wait the launching of a submillimeter satellite .",
    "although the li abundance is low ( 10@xmath7 - 10@xmath8 ) , the observation of the lih molecule in the cold interstellar medium looks promising , because it has a large dipole moment , @xmath9 debye ( lawrence et al .  1963 ) ,",
    "and the first rotational level is at @xmath10 above the ground level , the corresponding wavelength is @xmath11 ( pearson & gordy 1969 ; rothstein 1969 ) .",
    "the line frequencies in the submillimeter and far - infrared domain have been recently determined with high precision in the laboratory ( plummer et al 1984 , bellini et al 1994 ) .",
    "because of the great astrophysical interest of this molecule ( e.g. puy et al 1993 ) , an attempt has been made to detect lih at very high redshifts ( @xmath12 ) with the iram 30 m telescope ( de bernardis et al 1993 ) .",
    "it has been proposed that the lih molecules could smooth the primary cbr ( cosmic background radiation ) anisotropies , due to resonant scattering , or create secondary anisotropies , and they could be the best way to detect primordial clouds as they turn - around from expansion ( maoli et al 1996 , but see also stancil et al 1996 , bougleux & galli 1997 ) .",
    "there has recently been some controversy about the abundance of lih .",
    "the computations of lepp & shull ( 1984 ) estimated the lih / h@xmath5 abundance ratio in primordial diffuse clouds to be as high as 10@xmath13 . with h@xmath5/h",
    "@xmath14 10@xmath15 , the primordial lih / h ratio is @xmath1410@xmath16 .",
    "more recently , stancil et al .",
    "( 1996 ) computed an lih / h abundance of @xmath17 in the postrecombination epoch , since quantum mechanical computations now predict the rate coefficient for lih formation through radiative association to be 3 orders of magnitude smaller than previously thought from semi - classical methods ( dalgarno et al 1996 ) . in very dense clouds ,",
    "however , three - body association reactions must be taken into account , and a significant fraction of all lithium will turn into molecules .",
    "complete conversion due to this process requires gas densities of the order @xmath18@xmath19 , rarely found in the general ism .",
    "however , taken other processes into account , such as dust grain formation , an upper limit to the lih abundance is the complete conversion of all li into molecular form , with lih / h@xmath5 @xmath20 . with a lih column density of 10@xmath1@xmath2 , or n(h@xmath5)@xmath21@xmath2",
    ", the optical depth of the lih line will reach @xmath141 , in cold clouds of velocity dispersion of @xmath22 .",
    "the line should then be easily detectable in dense dark clouds in the present interstellar medium ( like orion where the column density reaches 10@xmath23 - 10@xmath24 @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is a fundamental step to understand the lih molecule formation , in order to interpret future results on primordial clouds , although the primordial abundance of li could be increased by about a factor 10 in stellar nucleosynthesis ( e.g. reeves 1994 ) .",
    "once the li abundance is known as a function of redshift , it could be possible to derive its true primordial abundance , a key factor to test big bang nucleosynthesis ( either homogeneous or not ) .",
    "up to now , due to atmospheric opacity , no astrophysical lih line has been detected , and the abundance of lih in the ism is unknown . the atmosphere would allow to detect the isotopic molecule lid ( its fundamental rotational line is at 251 ghz ) , but it has not been seen because of the low d / h ratio , and the expected insufficient optical depth of lih .",
    "upper limit to the lid abundance towards sgrb2 is @xmath25@xmath2 . ]",
    "another method to avoid atmospheric absorption lines is to observe a remote object , for which the lines are redshifted into an atmospheric window .",
    "here we report about the first absorption search for a lih line at high redshift : the latter allows us to overcome the earth atmosphere opacity , and thanks to the absorption technique we benefit of an excellent spatial resolution , equal to the angular size of the b0218 + 357 quasar core , of the order of 1 milli - arcsec ( patnaik et al 1995 ) . at the distance of the absorber ( redshift @xmath26 , giving an angular size distance of 1089 mpc , for @xmath27=75 km / s / mpc and @xmath28 = 0.5 )",
    ", this corresponds to 5pc .",
    "we expect a detectable lih signal , since the h@xmath5 column density is estimated to be n(h@xmath5)@xmath29 @xmath2 .",
    "menten & reid ( 1996 ) derive an n(h@xmath5 ) value ten times lower than this , using the h@xmath5co(@xmath30 ) transition at 8.6ghz . at this low frequency",
    "the structure and extent of the background continuum source may be quite larger than at 100200 ghz and the source covering factor smaller .",
    "this means that their estimate of the column density is a lower limit .",
    "the observations were made with the iram 30 m telescope at pico veleta near granada , spain .",
    "they were carried out in four observing runs , in december 1996 , march , july and december 1997 .",
    "table 1 displays the observational parameters .",
    "we observed at 263 ghz with an sis receiver tuned in single sideband ( ssb ) .",
    "the ssb receiver temperature varied between 400 and 450k , the system temperature was 600 - 1400k depending on weather conditions , and the sideband rejection ratio was 10db ( the image frequency is at 271.5 ghz , in a region where the atmospheric opacity increases rapidly due to water vapour ) .",
    "we used a 512x1mhz filterbank and an autocorelator backend , with 0.3 km / s resolution .",
    "we present here only the 1mhz resolution spectra , smoothed to a 2.3 km / s channels , to improve the signal to noise .       to interpret this result ,",
    "comparison should be made with the atomic species .",
    "first , it is likely that the molecular cloud on the line of sight is dense and dark , and all the hydrogen is molecular , f(h@xmath5 ) = 0.5",
    ". the li abundance ( main isotope @xmath31li ) at @xmath26 ( i.e 5 - 10 gyr ago ) can be estimated at li / h @xmath32 , since its abundance in the ism increases with time .",
    "the primordial li abundance must be similar to that in metal deficient unevolved population ii stars , li / h = 1 - 2 10@xmath7 ( spite & spite 1982 ) , but li could be depleted at the stellar surface by internal mixing . in meteorites and unevolved , unmixed pop i stars , li / h @xmath32 , representative of the li abundance some 4 gyr ago .",
    "the present abundance in the ism is estimated around 3 10@xmath8 ( lemoine et al 1993 ) .",
    "we therefore deduce lih / li @xmath14 1.5 10@xmath33 . the uncertainty associated with the derived abundances",
    "are large , but the low lih / li ratio seems to exclude complete transformation of li into lih , as would be expected in very dense clouds ( e.g. stancil et al 1996 , although the li chemistry is not yet completely understood in dark clouds ) .",
    "however , it is likely that the cloud is clumpy , and in some of the more diffuse parts , lih is photodissociated ( e.g. kirby & dalgarno 1978 ) .",
    "also , some regions of the cloud could have a higher excitation temperature , in which case our computation under - estimates the lih abundance ( although the absorption technique selects preferentially cold gas , and the black - body temperature at the redshift of the absorbing molecules is @xmath34 = 4.6 k ) .",
    "the present observations suggest that the detection of lih in emission towards dense clouds in the milky way should be easy with a submillimeter satellite , provided that the spatial resolution is enough to avoid dilution of the dense clumps .",
    "it is also interesting to observe the rarer molecule @xmath35lih , which in some clouds might be of same order of abundance as the main isotopic species . through optical absorption lines",
    "lemoine et al ( 1995 ) find towards two velocity components in @xmath36-oph , @xmath31li/@xmath35li = 8.6 and 1.4 .",
    "since @xmath35li is formed only in negligible amounts in the big bang , this ratio indicates that cosmic ray spallation has increased significantly the li abundances .",
    "this work could not have been done without the generous support from the iram-30 m staff .",
    "we also thank the referee , daniele galli , for useful and interesting comments .",
