    "this gives @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the frequency of mode @xmath95 .",
    "as discussed in the main text , we consider a pancake of atoms by writing @xmath42 where @xmath125 we can then eliminate the @xmath31 dependence from all the above terms , and write effective transverse dynamics of atoms and light .",
    "to proceed , we compute the integral @xmath126 to do this , we work in the approximation that @xmath127 so that we can drop the fast oscillating terms depending on @xmath128 and evaluate @xmath129 at @xmath130 .",
    "this gives @xmath131 this allows us to write the dynamics of @xmath132 in terms of the cavity mode amplitudes @xmath133 .",

    "( [ modeeom ] ) by @xmath135 and sum over @xmath95 to get the equation of motion for @xmath136 .",

    "this leads to a quasi - local matter - light interaction , and thus , as we see in the main text , provides a close analog to the standard meissner effect . since @xmath142 , the cosine term drops out of eq .",

    "together with the relation @xmath144 this leads to the equation of motion for the 2d cavity field , which combined with the equation of motion of the atom condensate , describes the dynamics of the system .",
    "in order to have an approximately constant artificial magnetic field over a large area while keeping the intensity symmetric , we choose a pump profile @xmath145 which , in an empty cavity , would give @xmath146 .",
    "we then convolve this profile with a gaussian of width @xmath147 so that it is smoothed near @xmath148 .",

    "such a profile can be achieved using , e.g. , a digital multimirror device ( dmd )  @xcite .",
    "as noted in the main text , there are some distinctions between the behaviour we predict here , and the standard meissner effect .",
    "this section discusses in further detail the origin of these distinctions .    in the standard meissner effect",
    ", there is a vector potential @xmath150 which couples ( via minimal coupling ) to the matter component .",
    "the remaining action for the system then takes the maxwell form , @xmath151 , in terms of the field tensor @xmath152 .",
    "our equations of motion correspond to an action that differs in several ways .",
    "firstly , our action is non - relativistic ( i.e. , not lorenz covariant ) : this affects the dynamics , but not the steady state .",
    "secondly , our action is not gauge invariant ",
    "i.e . , our action depends directly on @xmath92 , which plays the role of the vector potential , rather than depending only on derivatives of this quantity .",
    "most notably , our action is not gapless .",
    "this last distinction , which occurs due to the inevitable cavity loss terms , means that there is no sharp distinction between the case of coupling to superfluid or normal atoms : the magnetic field always has a finite penetration depth  i.e .",
    ", away from the location of the source term @xmath84 , the field @xmath45 will decay .",
    "however , in our numerical results , we clearly see a dramatic change in the suppression of the magnetic field .",
    "this is consistent , as the effect we are seeing can be understood as arising from a dramatic enhancement of the effective gap .",
    "explicitly , in eq .  [ phieom ] ,",
    "the superfluid induced gap , @xmath153 , is at least an order of magnitude larger than the other terms @xmath2 and @xmath5 , leading to a large suppression of the magnetic field .    an additional difference from textbook meissner physics arises because of the distinct geometry of our system . in our geometry , both the atom cloud , and the synthetic field vary only in the transverse two - dimensional plane . in the textbook example of the meissner example , a piece of superconducting material is placed in an externally imposed uniform magnetic field .",
    "however , imposing an uniform field requires sources , e.g. , loops of free current placed far away in the @xmath31 direction . in our geometry , with the synthetic field restricted to two dimensions , this is not possible .",
    "the source of the vector potential ( in our case the longitudinal pumping term , @xmath84 ) , must live in the same plane as the material . generating a pseudo uniform magnetic field",
    "thus requires an extended source term .",
    "the specific case we consider has this source exist across the entire plane .",
    "thus , we can not expect complete expulsion of the magnetic field , but only suppression .      to explore the above issues further numerically , fig .",

    "<S> however , with a few exceptions , all these have involved static gauge fields  there is no feedback of the atoms ( or photons ) on the synthetic field . </S>",

    "<S> in contrast , a charged superfluid acts back on the magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> the synthetic field can not be expelled in the above schemes because it is set by a fixed external laser or the system geometry . </S>",

    "<S> other opportunities arising from our work are to explore the differences between bose - condensed , thermal , and fermionic atoms in the geometry considered above : the meissner effect depends on the phase stiffness of superfluid atoms , so should vanish at higher temperatures . for fermions , one might use synthetic field expulsion as a probe of bcs superfluidity .    </S>",

    "<S> what our results show is that coupling to a superfluid significantly enhances the gap for this field ( in our case , by at least one order of magnitude ) , thus leading to a significant suppression of the field in the region where the atoms live . </S>",

    "<S> they represent the steady - state which is reached when the artificial magnetic field , proportional to the pump amplitude , is adiabatically increased from zero . a computationally efficient way to find this is to evolve the equation of motion for the light field , which includes pumping and loss , in real time , while simultaneously evolving the equation of motion for the condensate in imaginary time and renormalizing this wavefunction at each step . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2](c ) can be explained by our choice of potential @xmath96 . as is clear from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ happrox ] ) , the field @xmath45 leads both to vector and scalar potential terms . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar potentials have two contributions : quadratic and quartic . as a consequence of working at the tune - out wavelength , the quadratic scalar potentials in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ happrox ] ) are zero , i.e. , @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> the quartic term is harder to eliminate , but its effects can be mitigated . </S>",
    "<S> part of the effect of the quartic term is to lead to a reduction ( or even reversal ) of the transverse harmonic trapping of the atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this can be compensated by choosing a trap of the form @xmath98 i.e. , an asymmetric harmonic oscillator potential with @xmath99 . </S>",
    "<S> however , this expression assumes @xmath100 , as would hold in the absence of atomic diamagnetism . </S>",
    "<S> as the magnetic field is expelled , the scalar potential also changes , and the condensate becomes more tightly trapped .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig3 ] shows cross - sections at @xmath101 of ( a ) the atomic density and ( b ) the artificial magnetic field for various values of the total number of atoms . </S>",
    "<S> increasing the number of atoms leads to a larger condensate with a lower peak density ( integral of density remains normalized ) . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting magnetic field profile is shown in ( b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the area of low magnetic field is closely aligned to the area of high atomic density . at the edges of the cloud </S>",
    "<S> , the artificial field is increased as the expelled field accumulates here , before returning to its default value well outside the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of vortices in the very low density areas can also be seen .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> we have shown how a spatially varying synthetic gauge field can be achieved , and how magnetc field suppression in an atomic superfluid , analogous to the meissner effect , can be realized . by effecting an artifical magnetic field proportional to the intensity of light in a multimode cavity , </S>",
    "<S> we have coupled the dynamics of the spatial profile of the magnetic field and the atomic wavefunction . </S>",
    "<S> our results illustrate the potential of multimode cavity qed to simulate dynamical gauge fields , and to explore self - consistent steady states , and potentially phase transitions , of matter coupled to synthetic gauge fields .    </S>",
