    "on hadron and strange nuclear physics , nuclear system with anti - kaons ( @xmath11 mesons = ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) ) has been a hot issue , since the anti - kaon is expected to cause several interesting phenomena in finite nuclear system due to a strong attraction between anti - kaon and nucleon . in particular",
    ", the anti - kaon could be a key to access dense nuclear matter , for which partial restoration of chiral symmetry @xcite and kaon condensation @xcite have been discussed for a long time .",
    "both theoretical and experimental studies indicate that the @xmath6 interaction in the isospin @xmath10 channel is strongly attractive . while , it is known that mass of the excited hyperon @xmath14 can not be reproduced in a naive quark model with @xmath15-wave excitation @xcite , namely , mass of @xmath14 is predicted about 100 mev larger than the pdg value exceptionally . consequently , @xmath14 is considered to be a quasi - bound state of anti - kaon and nucleon since it exists at only @xmath16 mev below @xmath6 threshold .",
    "for example , chiral unitary model @xcite , based on a meson - baryon dynamics , has successfully explained various properties of the @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the @xmath14 is getting recognized as a @xmath6 quasi - bound state , rather than a genuine three - quark state .",
    "such the attractive nature of the @xmath6 interaction with a quasi - bound state , is consistent with the repulsive nature of the low - energy @xmath6 scattering data @xcite and the @xmath17-level energy shift of kaonic hydrogen atom @xcite which has been updated precisely @xcite .    for the @xmath6 interaction ,",
    "there are two kinds of potential : one is phenomenological energy - independent potentials ( _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the other is chiral su(3)-based energy - dependent potentials @xcite . both are fitted to observables of the @xmath6 system available at this moment , and are applied and discussed intensively .",
    "the former type of potentials is more strongly attractive than the latter type in @xmath6 sub - threshold region .",
    "one study based on a phenomenological @xmath6 potential @xcite argues a possibility of so - called deeply bound kaonic nuclei where an anti - kaon is deeply bound in finite nuclei with a binding energy of more than 100 mev , and such a deeply - bound state could exist as a quasi - stable state since the main decay channel @xmath18 is closed . in such a state , nucleons are drawn to the anti - kaon by the strong @xmath6 attraction , and hence a dense system is generated . in case of light @xmath19-shell nuclei ,",
    "studies with antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) method have shown that the average density amounts to @xmath20 , when an anti - kaon is added @xcite .",
    "( @xmath21 : normal nuclear density , around 0.17 @xmath22 . ) in case of medium and heavy nuclei , studies with the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) approach have been carried out , and it is shown that @xmath12 mesons can create a dense state inside the nucleus @xcite . therefore , we can expect kaonic nuclei to be a doorway to dense nuclear matter .",
    "thus , kaonic nuclei are considered to be an exotic system involving several interesting aspects from the viewpoint of hadron and nuclear physics . to reveal the nature of kaonic nuclei ,",
    "a prototype system of kaonic nuclei `` @xmath0 '' has been studied extensively.-@xmath23-@xmath24 coupled - channel system with the quantum numbers of @xmath25 and @xmath26 has been considered .",
    "such a three - body system is denoted symbolically and representatively , as `` @xmath0 '' in this article . ] since @xmath0 is a three - body system composed of a single @xmath12 meson and two protons , various approaches are adopted . as summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the resulting binding energy and decay width of @xmath0 become different depending on the combination of methods ( variational approach or faddeev - ags ) and potentials ( phenomenological or chiral - theory based ) @xcite . from that time",
    ", further studies on @xmath0 have been carried out . a variational calculation with the hyperspherical harmonics basis function",
    "is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the result agrees with that of an earlier study of another variational calculation @xcite when they use the same @xmath6 potential .",
    "a faddeev - ags calculation with an energy - dependent type of chiral su(3)-based @xmath6 potential is reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a @xmath0 state with small binding energy and large decay width is obtained similarly to the the variational calculation @xcite . on the other hand , there are several experiments to search for @xmath0 states . actually , the experimental result reported by finuda collaboration @xcite triggered studies of @xmath0 , although several questions were casted to their interpretation of the result @xcite .",
    "disto collaboration @xcite reported a bump structure found in a @xmath27 invariant - mass distribution from analysis of the past data on a @xmath28 reaction .",
    "these two collaborations claim that _ if the observed state is a @xmath0 bound state _",
    "the @xmath0 is strongly bound with the binding energy of more than 100 mev , although its decay width is rather different between two .",
    "thus , although much effort have been devoted to the study of @xmath0 , the definite conclusion has not been achieved yet in both the theoretical and experimental studies . however , in the theoretical side , we have one consensus that the @xmath0 exists as a resonance between the @xmath1 and @xmath23 thresholds , as commonly reported in all those calculations .    from those theoretical studies , we believe that the following two ingredients are important in theoretical studies of the @xmath0 system : _ 1 .",
    "coupled - channel problem _ and _ 2 .",
    "resonant state_. we employ a coupled - channel complex scaling method ( cccsm ) to study the @xmath0 , since both the ingredients can be dealt with in this method simultaneously . here",
    ", the complex scaling method ( csm ) is an established powerful tool to investigate resonant states , which has already succeeded greatly in the studies of resonant states of stable / unstable nuclei @xcite .",
    "the csm has several advantages to investigate finite nuclear systems as follows : first , we can handle resonant states in the same way as bound states , since the resonant wave function in the csm can be represented by using only the @xmath29 basis functions such as the gaussian basis functions which have been often used in bound - state studies .",
    "second , it is straightforward to increase the number of particles in the csm , which means that we can apply the csm to various many - body systems .",
    "in addition , detailed properties of resonant states can be investigated by analyzing the obtained csm wave function as usually done for bound states .    as the first attempt",
    ", we have applied the cccsm to the two - body @xmath6-@xmath7 system in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "( @xmath3 means @xmath4 and @xmath5 hyperons . ) through the study of scattering states as well as the resonant state @xmath14 , we have confirmed that the cccsm is quite useful to look into such a hadronic system . in that work ,",
    "we have constructed a @xmath6-@xmath7 potential based on the chiral su(3 ) theory , which has a gaussian form factor in the coordinate space and the energy - dependence .",
    "it is shown in studies based on chiral models @xcite , that @xmath14 should possess so - called a double - pole structure .",
    "we reconfirmed such a structure with our gaussian - type potential .",
    "we have successfully identified the lower pole as a broad resonant state , in addition to the higher pole , by using an improved gaussian basis function in the cccsm @xcite .",
    "since we have confirmed that the cccsm is quite effective to the two - body system of @xmath6-@xmath7 , we tackle the three - body kaonic nucleus @xmath0 in this article . to study the @xmath0 , normally we have to solve an equation in the coupled - channels @xmath1 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "but , in this paper we propose a convenient method to reduce such a coupled - channel problem to a single - channel problem , namely , we combine the cccsm and the feshbach projection method @xcite . with this method , we can handle the @xmath1-@xmath23-@xmath24 complicated system effectively as a simple @xmath1 system without loosing effect of the decay to two other open channels .",
    "actually , we study the @xmath0 as a gamow state and obtain the eigenstate as a definite pole on the complex - energy plane .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 is treated as a resonant state correctly in this study .",
    "in contrast , in the earlier studies of @xmath0 with variational approaches @xcite , the @xmath0 has been investigated within a bound - state approximation and the decay width is perturbatively estimated with the obtained wave function .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we explain our new method of cccsm+feshbach projection in detail and give all tools for the present calculation of the @xmath0 . in the section 3",
    ", we examine our method by solving the two - body @xmath6-@xmath7 system .",
    "main results of this paper , _",
    "i.e. _ application of our method to the three - body @xmath0 , are shown in the section 4 .",
    "section 5 is devoted to summary of the present study and discussion of our future plans .",
    "here , we give a brief explanation on the usual complex scaling method ( csm ) on which the present study is based @xcite . in the csm , hamiltonian",
    "@xmath30 and wave function @xmath31 are transformed with the complex scaling ( complex rotation ) operator @xmath32 as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively . with the complex scaling the coordinate @xmath35 and the conjugate momentum @xmath36 in the hamiltonian and wave function",
    "are transformed as @xmath37 where the variable @xmath38 is called as the scaling angle .    in eigenvalues of the complex - scaled hamiltonian ,",
    "those of scattering continuum states appear along so - called @xmath39 line on the complex - energy plane , which satisfies a relation @xmath40 .",
    "( the variable @xmath41 means a complex eigen energy with @xmath42 . )",
    "namely , they are dependent on the scaling angle . on the other hand , eigenvalues of bound and resonant states are proven to be independent of the scaling angle .",
    "in addition , as is easily checked , if we choose appropriate values of the scaling angle @xmath38 , wave functions of resonant states are transformed to become square - integrable , which are originally not so .",
    "therefore , the resonant - state wave function , which is complex - scaled , can be expanded with a square - integrable @xmath29 basis function such as gaussian basis functions , similarly to the bound - state wave functions .    due to those nature of the csm",
    ", we can obtain the eigen energies and eigen wave functions of resonant states , by diagonalizing the complex - scaled hamiltonian with gaussian basis functions .",
    "detailed explanation on the complex scaling method is summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite .      in the present study",
    ", we reduce a coupled - channel problem to a single - channel problem for an economical calculation , based on feshbach projection method @xcite . in the feshbach method , a model space ( @xmath15 space ) and outer space of the model space ( @xmath43 space ) are assigned with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "schrdinger equation is given as a coupled equation of wave functions for @xmath15 and @xmath43 spaces as @xmath46 which @xmath47 and @xmath48 denote @xmath15- and @xmath43-space wave functions , respectively . by the elimination of the @xmath43-space wave function , an equation for the @xmath15-space wave function",
    "is derived from eq .",
    "( [ fesh_cc ] ) : @xmath49 since hamiltonian for the @xmath15 space @xmath50 is composed of the kinetic energy term @xmath51 and the potential term @xmath52 , the above equation can be written as @xmath53 here , the term @xmath54 is regarded as an effective potential for the @xmath15 space .",
    "thus , we obtain a single - channel schrdinger equation for the @xmath15-space wave function in a formal way .    in application of feshbach method to actual studies ,",
    "the problem is how to represent the @xmath43-space green function , @xmath55 in eq .",
    "( [ fesh_s1 ] ) .",
    "we realize the feshbach method with help of a nature of the complex scaling method ( csm ) as follows . it is proven that the closure relation holds in the csm which includes explicitly resonant states as well as continuum scattering states and bound states @xcite .",
    "( _ extended closure relation _ , ecr , proposed by berggren @xcite ) the ecr is shown to be useful to represent the green function of a system @xcite .",
    "in addition , the ecr is well described approximately with a set of finite number of the complex - scaled eigenstates @xmath56 which are obtained by the diagonalization of a complex - scaled hamiltonian @xmath57 with gaussian basis functions @xmath58 @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the state index and complex parameters @xmath61 are determined by a diagonalization of @xmath57 .",
    "we incorporate the ecr on the @xmath43 space into the feshbach method .",
    "first , we consider the complex - scaled green function for the @xmath43-space , @xmath62 . with the application of the ecr shown in eq .",

    ", we obtain the non - scaled green function @xmath55 from the complex - scaled one @xmath68 ; @xmath69 . substituting the obtained @xmath70 to eq .",
    "( [ fesh_s2 ] ) , we can represent the effective @xmath15-space potential as @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "since the eigenstates @xmath65 are expanded with gaussian basis function , the effective potential is expressed with gaussian functions when the original coupled - channel potential is given in a gaussian form .",
    "therefore , the effective potential @xmath54 derived in this way is easily handled in conventional many - body calculations with gaussian basis functions .    thus , we reduce a coupled - channel problem to a single - channel problem with feshbach projection method which is assisted with a unique nature of the complex scaling method .",

    "<S> kaonic nuclei ( nuclear system with anti - kaons ) have been an interesting subject in hadron and strange nuclear physics , because the strong attraction between anti - kaon and nucleon might bring exotic properties to that system . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we investigate @xmath0 as a prototype of kaonic nuclei . here , @xmath0 is a three - body resonant state in the @xmath1-@xmath2 coupled channels , where @xmath3 represents hyperons @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in order to treat resonant states in a coupled - channel system properly , </S>",
    "<S> we propose newly a coupled - channel complex scaling method combined with the feshbach projection , namely cccsm+feshbach method . in this method , </S>",
    "<S> the feshbach projection is realized with help of so - called the extended closure relation held in the complex scaling method , and a complicated coupled - channel problem is reduced to a simple single - channel problem which one can treat easily . </S>",
    "<S> first , we confirm that the cccsm+feshbach method completely reproduces results of a full coupled - channel calculation in case of two - body @xmath6-@xmath7 system . </S>",
    "<S> we then proceed to study of three - body @xmath1-@xmath2 system , and successfully find solutions of the @xmath0 resonance by imposing self - consistency for the complex @xmath6 energy . </S>",
    "<S> obtained binding energy of @xmath0 is well converged around 27 mev , with an energy - dependent @xmath6(-@xmath7 ) potential based on the chiral su(3 ) theory , independently of ansatz for the self - consistency . </S>",
    "<S> this binding energy is small as ones reported in earlier studies based on chiral models . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> decay width of @xmath0 strongly depends on the ansatz . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate also the correlation density of @xmath8 and @xmath6 pairs by using the obtained complex - scaled wave function of the @xmath0 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> effect of the repulsive core of @xmath8 potential is seen in the @xmath8 correlation density . in the @xmath6 correlation density </S>",
    "<S> , we can confirm survival of @xmath9 resonance ( @xmath10 @xmath6 resonance ) in the three - body resonance . </S>"
