    "high resolution n - body simulations have revealed the survival of considerable substructure within galactic halos . assuming these substructure clumps are composed of annihilating neutralinos , the flux @xmath1 of a clump at distance @xmath2 with a density distribution @xmath3 is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section , @xmath6 is the neutralino mass , and @xmath7 is the number of photons per annihilation with energy above an assumed energy threshold . for the density profile of the clumps we use the @xcite ( nfw ) and the @xcite profiles which were found to describe adequately the dark matter halos in simulations . as an upper limit to the degree of central concentration of the actual clump profile we also consider the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) .",
    "the three profiles behave at the center as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the results for the profiles and for the minimum and maximum clump masses used , are shown in fig .",
    "[ conti - susy ] .",
    "the susy models that give a 5-@xmath11 ( or more ) detection using an atmospheric cherenkov telescope ( act ) with effective area @xmath12 , energy threshold @xmath13 gev , and 100 hours of observation , are all the models that lie above the corresponding line for each density profile .",
    "the backgrounds used to calculate the noise are the hadronic and electronic cosmic ray shower contributions . clearly , massive clumps appear to be easily detectable , regardless of profile ; less massive clumps may be detectable , depending on their degree of central concentration . for more details",
    "see @xcite .",
    "there are some issues with respect to the ability of dark matter clumps to survive tidal disruption at distances small enough to yield easily detectable fluxes .",
    "in addition , there are some observational issues , given that the exact location of these clumps is not known .",
    "thus , we focus on an object whose location is known , the lmc .",
    "we derive the density profile needed to calculate the @xmath0-ray flux using rotation velocity data @xcite .",
    "we fit the data using both the nfw ( @xmath14 ) , and the @xcite profile ( @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 numerous observations indicate that the lmc is tidally stripped .",
    "the hayashi et al . profile is a modification of the nfw which accounts for the tidal stripping that a halo may have undergone .",
    "the fits are shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lmc_susy ] . in the right panel",
    "we present our results for the part of the susy parameter space that gives a 5-@xmath11 detection for glast and a typical act ; the instrument and observation parameters used to derive these results are also shown . requiring that @xmath17 @xmath18 s@xmath19 we find that glast will be able to detect the signal for a significant part of the parameter space .",
    "this is true especially if the recently derived limit @xmath20 gev is taken into account@xcite .",
    "assuming standard specifications , acts will not be able to probe any part of the parameter space ( dotted line ) . unless , large integration times ( say , @xmath21 month ) and effective areas ( say , @xmath22 @xmath23 ) are used ( dashed line ) .",
    "note though that such integration times are fairly long for act observations , and that such large effective areas for an energy threshold @xmath24 50 gev are beyond the goals of existing and upcoming acts .",
    "these conclusions remain essentially the same for all the profiles used to model the lmc halo . the spectrum and its characteristic features , such as the cutoff at @xmath25 will be useful in identifying neutralino annihilation as the origin of the observed flux , especially in the case of glast where the prospects of detection are fairly good .",
    "the monochromatic lines produced by neutralino annihilation ( e.g. , the @xmath26 line at @xmath25 ) would be excellent observational signatures if the cross sections for these processes were not suppressed@xcite .",
    "egret has detected a flux of @xmath27 photons @xmath28 @xmath18 @xmath29 from the lmc @xcite .",
    "the emission due to neutralino annihilation can be anywhere from @xmath30 to @xmath31 photons @xmath32 , depending on the neutralino parameters .",
    "the maximum possible flux is still @xmath24 2 orders of magnitude less than the observed flux .",
    "this means that cosmic rays may be almost the exclusive source of the observed flux , as is often assumed .",
    "this is verified in the case of synchrotron emission from neutralino annihilation as well [ for the synchrotron and for more details on the @xmath0-rays see @xcite ] .",
    "dark matter clumps are in principle detectable , depending on the susy parameters , their distance and their degree of central concentration .",
    "the expected @xmath0-ray flux from the lmc is , for most susy models , significantly smaller than what egret observed , verifying the usual assumption that cosmic rays are almost exclusively the origin of the detected flux .",
    "however , the flux is high enough to renter a large part of the susy parameter space accessible to glast ; the detection of the signal by acts is highly unlikely ."
