    "the star formation history of galaxies is imprinted in their integrated light . the first attempts to interpret the light emitted from galaxies in terms of their stellar content relied on _ trial and error _ analyses ( e.g. , @xcite ;",
    "; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this technique ,",
    "one reproduces the integrated spectrum of a galaxy with a linear combination of individual stellar spectra of various types taken from a comprehensive library .",
    "the technique was abandoned in the early 1980 s because the number of free parameters was too large to be constrained by typical galaxy spectra .",
    "more recent models are based on the _ evolutionary population synthesis _ technique ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ) . in this approach ,",
    "the main adjustable parameters are the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , the star formation rate ( sfr ) and , in some cases , the rate of chemical enrichment .",
    "assumptions about the time evolution of these parameters allow one to compute the age - dependent distribution of stars in the hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagram , from which the integrated spectral evolution of the stellar population can be obtained .",
    "these models have become standard tools in the interpretation of galaxy colours and spectra .    despite important progress over the last decade ,",
    "modern population synthesis models still suffer from serious limitations .",
    "the largest _ intrinsic _ uncertainties of the models arise from the poor understanding of some advanced phases of stellar evolution , such as the supergiant phase and the asymptotic - giant - branch ( agb ) phase ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "stars in these phases are very bright and have a strong influence on integrated - light properties .",
    "the limitations arising from these uncertainties in the interpretation of galaxy spectra are further amplified by the fact that age , metallicity and dust all tend to affect spectra in similar ways .",
    "this is especially true at the low resolving power of most current population synthesis models , i.e. , typically @xmath3 at optical wavelengths ( see however @xcite ; @xcite ) . as a result ,",
    "light - weighted ages and metallicities derived from integrated galaxy spectra tend to be strongly degenerate ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for old stellar populations ,",
    "this degeneracy may be broken by studying surface brightness fluctuations , that are more sensitive to the details of the stellar luminosity function than ordinary integrated light ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this method , however , is mostly applicable to studies of nearby ellipticals and spiral bulges .",
    "the general contention is that the age - metallicity degeneracy can be broken by appealing to refined spectral diagnostics involving individual stellar absorption - line features ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "spectral indices _ of this kind have been defined at optical and near - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in",
    "the widely used ` lick system ' , the strengths of 25 spectral indices were parametrized as functions of stellar effective temperature , gravity and metallicity using a sample of 460 galactic stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this convenient parametrization allows one to compute integrated index strengths of model galaxies with any stellar population synthesis code . in practice ,",
    "however , theapplications are limited to studies of old stellar populations because of the lack of hot stars in the lick stellar library .",
    "also , the lick indices were defined in spectra which were not flux - calibrated and whose resolution ( @xmath4   fwhm ) is three times lower than achieved in modern spectroscopic galaxy surveys , such as the _ sloan digital sky survey _ ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus high - quality galaxy spectra must first be _ degraded _ to the specific calibration and wavelength - dependent resolution of the lick system for lick index - strength analyses to be performed ( section  4.4 ) .",
    "ideally , one requires a population synthesis model that can predict actual _ spectra _ of galaxies at the resolution of modern surveys .",
    "the model of @xcite fulfills this requirement .",
    "however , it is limited to two narrow wavelength regions , 38204500   and 47805460   .    in this paper",
    ", we present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations of different metallicities at ages between @xmath0yr and @xmath1yr at a resolution of 3   fwhm across the whole wavelength range from 3200   to 9500   ( corresponding to a median resolving power @xmath5 ) . these predictions are based on a new library of observed stellar spectra recently assembled by .",
    "we also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range , from 91   to 160  @xmath2 m , at lower spectral resolution .",
    "this model should be particularly useful for interpreting the spectra gathered by modern spectroscopic surveys in terms of constraints on the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  2 below ,",
    "we present the stellar evolution prescription and the stellar spectral library on which our model relies .",
    "we consider several alternatives for these ingredients .",
    "we adopt an observationally motivated prescription for thermally - pulsing agb stars , which is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we also briefly recall the principle of the _ isochrone synthesis _",
    "technique for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations @xcite . in section  3 , we investigate the influence of the main adjustable parameters of the model on photometric predictions and compare our results with previous work . comparisons with observed colour - magnitude diagrams and integrated colours of star clusters of various ages and metallicities are also presented in this section . in section  4",
    ", we compute the spectral evolution of stellar populations and compare our model with observed galaxy spectra from the sdss edr @xcite .",
    "we compare in detail the predicted and observed strengths of several absorption - line indices and identify those indices that appear to be most promising for constraining the stellar content of galaxies .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  5 , where we also suggest ways of including the effects of gas and dust in the interstellar medium on the stellar radiation computed with our model .",
    "readers interested mainly in the photometric predictions of the model may skip directly to section  3 , while those interested mainly in applications of the model to interpret galaxy spectra may skip directly to section  4 .",
    "in this section , we present the main two ingredients of our population synthesis model : the stellar evolution prescription and the stellar spectral library .",
    "we consider several alternatives for each of these .",

    ", we consider three possible stellar evolution prescriptions in our model ( table  [ tracks - options ] ) .",
    "we first consider the library of stellar evolutionary tracks computed by , , , , and .",
    "this library encompasses a wide range of initial chemical compositions , @xmath6 , 0.0004 , 0.004 , 0.008 , 0.02 , 0.05 , and 0.1 with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) assumed .",
    "the range of initial masses is @xmath10 for all metallicities , except for @xmath6 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the tracks were computed using the radiative opacities of @xcite , which were computed last , include slightly updated opacities and equation of state . according to , these updates do not compromise the consistency with the predictions at higher metallicities . ] and include all phases of stellar evolution from the zero - age main sequence to the beginning of the thermally pulsing regime of the asymptotic giant branch ( tp - agb ; for low- and intermediate - mass stars ) and core - carbon ignition ( for massive stars ) . for solar composition , the models are normalized to the temperature , luminosity , and radius of the sun at an age of 4.6  gyr .",

    "overshooting is also included in the convective envelopes of low- and intermediate - mass stars , as suggested by observations of the red giant branch and horizontal branch of star clusters in the galactic halo and the large magellanic cloud ( hereafter lmc ; ) .",

    "mild overshooting is included in the convective cores of stars more massive than @xmath31 .",
    "differences with the solar - metallicity calculations of in the padova 1994 library include : the absence of overshooting in the convective cores of stars with masses between 1.0 and 1.5@xmath32 and in the convective envelopes of low- and intermediate - mass stars ; the higher helium fraction ; the inclusion of mass loss along the red giant branch ; the treatment of convection during core - helium burning ; and the internal mixing and mass loss of massive stars .",
    "the signatures of these differences in the stellar evolutionary tracks have been investigated by @xcite .",
    "we refer to this alternative set of tracks for solar metallicity as the ` geneva library ' .",
    "we supplement the padova and geneva tracks of low- and intermediate - mass stars beyond the early - agb with tp - agb and post - agb evolutionary tracks . at all metallicities in the padova tracks and @xmath33 in the geneva tracks . ]",
    "the tp - agb phase is one of the most difficult evolutionary phases to model because of the combined effects of thermal pulses ( i.e. , helium shell flashes ) , changes in surface abundance caused by heavy element dredge - up ( e.g. , carbon ) and important mass loss terminated by a superwind and the ejection of the stellar envelope ( see the reviews by @xcite and ) .",
    "this phase must be included in population synthesis models because the stochastic presence of a few tp - agb stars has a strong influence on the integrated colours of star clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; see also section  3.3.2 below ) .",
    "we appeal to recent models of tp - agb stars which have been calibrated using observations of stars in the galaxy , the lmc and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) . in particular , we adopt the effective temperatures , bolometric luminosities and lifetimes of tp - agb stars from the multi - metallicity models of @xcite . to 1025 per cent longer for stars with @xmath34 in the @xcite models for all the metallicities in common with the padova tracks ( @xmath35 , 0.008 , and 0.02 ) .",
    "this similarity justifies the combination of the two sets of calculations . ] these models , which include predictions for both the optically - visible and the superwind phases , predict maximum tp - agb luminosities in good agreement with those observed in magellanic cloud clusters .",
    "the models are for the metallicities @xmath36 , 0.004 , 0.008 , and 0.016 , which do not encompass all the metallicities in the padova track library . for simplicity ,",
    "we adopt the @xmath36 prescription of @xcite at all metallicities @xmath37 and their @xmath38 prescription at all metallicities @xmath39 .",
    "carbon dredge - up during tp - agb evolution can lead to the transition from an oxygen - rich ( m - type ) to a carbon - rich ( c - type ) star ( e.g. , ) .",
    "since c - type stars are much redder than m - type stars and can dominate the integrated light of some star clusters , it is important to include them in the models . the minimum initial mass limit for a carbon star to form increases with metallicity .",
    "this is supported observationally by the decrease in the ratio of c to m stars from the smc , to the lmc , to the galactic bulge @xcite .",
    "while the formation of carbon stars is relatively well understood , no simple prescription is available to date that would allow us to describe accurately the transition from m to c stars over a wide range of initial masses and metallicities . and have computed models of tp - agb stars , which reproduce the ratios of c to m stars observed in the lmc and the galaxy .",
    "we use these models to define the transition from an m - type star to a c - type star in the tp - agb evolutionary tracks of @xcite .",
    "we require that , for a given initial main - sequence mass , the relative durations of the two phases be the same as those in the models of and .",
    "since these models do not extend to sub - magellanic ( @xmath40 ) nor super - solar ( @xmath41 ) metallicities , we apply fixed relative durations of the m - type and c - type phases in the padova tracks for more extreme metallicities .",
    "as shown by @xcite , this simple but observationally motivated prescription for tp - agb stars provides good agreement with the observed optical and near - infrared surface brightness fluctuations of ( metal - poor ) galactic globular clusters and ( more metal - rich ) nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "for the post - agb evolution , we adopt the evolutionary tracks of @xcite , whose calculations cover the range of metallicities @xmath42 .",
    "we use the relationship to compute the core mass of a star after ejection of the planetary nebula ( pn ) at the tip of the agb from its initial mass on the main sequence ( see for a review ; and @xcite ) . to each low- and intermediate - mass star in the padova and geneva libraries",
    ", we then assign the post - agb evolution computed by @xcite corresponding to the closest core mass and metallicity .",
    "these authors did not consider the evolution of stars with core masses less than @xmath43 , corresponding to a main sequence progenitor mass less than about @xmath44 .",
    "for lower - mass stars , we adopt the @xmath45 post - agb evolutionary track computed for the metallicity @xmath46 by @xcite , with an extension by .",
    "since we will consider stellar population ages of up to 20  gyr , and the post - agb calculations do not generally extend to this limit , we further supplement the tracks using white dwarf cooling models by @xcite at luminosities @xmath47 . following the suggestion by winget et al .",
    ", we adopt their ` pure carbon ' models for masses in the range @xmath48 , in which the cooling times differ by only 15 per cent from those in models including lighter elements .",
    "the prescription is thus naturally independent of the metallicity of the progenitor star . specifically , we interpolate cooling ages for white dwarfs as a function of luminosity at the masses corresponding to the @xcite and @xcite tracks .",
    "since @xcite do not tabulate the temperatures nor the radii of their model white dwarfs , we assign effective temperatures as a function of luminosity using the slope of the white dwarf cooling sequence defined by the calculations of @xcite , i.e. , @xmath49 .",
    "the resulting tracks in the padova and geneva libraries cover all phases of evolution from zero - age main sequence to remnant stage for all stars more massive than @xmath20 ( @xmath50 for the padova 2000 library ) .",
    "since the main - sequence lifetime of a @xmath20 star is nearly 80  gyr , we supplement these libraries with multi - metallicity models of unevolving main - sequence stars in the mass range @xmath51 .",
    "these models provide smooth extensions of the padova and geneva calculations into the lower main sequence . for the purpose of isochrone synthesis",
    ", all tracks must be resampled to a system of evolutionary phases of equivalent physical significance @xcite .",

    "also , the lack of cool m - dwarf stars has a negligible influence on model predictions , because these stars do not contribute significantly to the integrated light of stellar populations ( as found when adopting representative spectra for these stars ; see appendix a ) . for the coolest giant stars , we adopt in any case the prescription outlined in section  2.2.4 below .",
    "the main interest of the stelib library is that it enables the interpretation of integrated spectra of star clusters and galaxies taken at relatively high resolution in the wavelength range 32009500   . to allow for a consistent modelling of spectral properties outside this range",
