    "we organize the paper as follows :    section [ finite non - periodic real toda lattice ] introduces the real non - periodic toda lattices .",
    "it begins with two formulations of the toda lattice in which the flow obeys a lax equation on a set of real tridiagonal matrices whose subdiagonal entries are positive .",
    "the matrices are symmetric in one formulation and hessenberg in the other .",
    "the flows exist for all time and preserve the spectrum of the initial condition , and the system is completely integrable .",
    "the references cited for these results are @xcite . when the matrices of the toda lattice system are extended to allow the subdiagonal entries to take on any real value , the two forms of the toda lattice differ in the behavior of their solutions and in the topology of their isospectral sets . in the symmetric case ,",
    "the flows exist for all time and the isospectral manifolds are compact , while in the hessenberg form , the flows blow up in finite time and the isospectral manifolds are not compact . for these results ,",
    "the cited references are @xcite .",
    "section 1 concludes with the full symmetric real toda lattice , in which the flows evolve on the set of all real symmetric matrices .",
    "the symplectic structure comes from the lie - poisson structure on the dual of a borel subalgebra of @xmath0 . in the full toda lattice ,",
    "more constants of motion are needed to establish complete integrability . cited references for this material are @xcite .",
    "section [ complex toda lattices ] describes the iso - level sets of the constants of motion in complex toda lattices .",
    "the complex tridiagonal toda lattice in hessenberg form differs from the real case in that the flows no longer preserve `` signs '' of the subdiagonal entries .",
    "the flows again blow up in finite ( complex ) time , and the isospectral manifolds are not compact .",
    "these manifolds are compactified by embedding them into a flag manifold in two different ways . in one compactification of isospectral sets with distinct eigenvalues ,",
    "the flows enter lower - dimensional bruhat cells at the blow - up times , where the singularity at a blow - up time is characterized by the bruhat cell @xcite . under a different embedding , which works for arbitrary spectrum ,",
    "the toda flows generate a group action on the flag manifold , where the group depends on how eigenvalues are repeated .",
    "the group is a product of a diagonal torus and a unipotent group , becoming the maximal diagonal torus when eigenvalues are distinct and a unipotent group when all eigenvalues coincide @xcite .",
    "these group actions , together with the moment map @xcite , are used in @xcite to study the geometry of arbitrary isospectral sets of the complex tridiagonal toda lattice in hessenberg form .",
    "these compactified iso - level sets are generalizations of toric varieties @xcite",
    ". further properties of the actions of these torus and unipotent components of these groups are found in @xcite .",
    "the survey then considers the full kostant - toda lattice , where the complex matrices in hessenberg form are extended to have arbitrary complex entries below the diagonal .",
    "the techniques for finding additonal constants of motion in the real symmetric case are adapted to the full kostant - toda lattice to obtain a complete family of integrals in involution on the generic symplectic leaves ; the geometry of a generic iso - level set is then explained using flag manifolds @xcite .",
    "nongeneric flows of the full kostant - toda lattice are described in terms of special faces and splittings of moment polytopes , and monodromy around nongeneric iso - level sets in special cases is determined @xcite .",
    "section [ other extensions ] provides other extensions of the toda lattice . in this paper , we only discuss those related to finite non - periodic toda lattices .",
    "we first introduce the flow in the lax form on an arbitrary diagonalizable matrix , which can be integrated by the inverse scattering method ( or equivalently by the factorization method ) @xcite .",
    "we then show how the tridiagonal hessenberg and symmetric toda lattices , which are defined on the lie algebra of type @xmath1 ( that is , @xmath2 ) , are extended to semisimple lie algebras using the lie algebra splittings given by the gauss decomposition and the qr decomposition , respectively @xcite . as an important related hierarchy of flows , we explain the kac - van moerbeke system , which can be considered as a square root of the toda lattice @xcite .",
    "we also show that the pfaff lattice , which evolves on symplectic matrices , is related to the indefinite toda lattice @xcite . as another aspect of the toda lattice , we mention its gradient structure @xcite , which explains the sorting property in the asymptotic behavior of the solution and",
    "can be used to solve problems in combinatorian optimization and linear programming @xcite .",
    "section [ kp connection ] explains the connections with the kp equation @xcite in the sense that the @xmath3-functions as the solutions of the toda lattices also provide a certain class of solutions of the kp equation in a wronskian determinant form @xcite .",
    "this is based on the sato theory of the kp hierarchy , which states that the solution of the kp hierarchy is given by an orbit of the universal grassmannian @xcite .",
    "the main proposition in this section shows that there is a bijection between the set of @xmath3-functions that arise as a @xmath4 wronskian determiant and the grassmannian @xmath5 , the set of all @xmath6-dimensional subspaces of @xmath7 .",
    "we present a method to obtain soliton solutions of the kp equation and give an elementary introduction to the sato theory in a finite - dimensional setting .",
    "the moment polytopes of the fundamental representations of @xmath8 play a crucial role in describing the geometry of the soliton solutions of the kp equation .",
    "section [ toda - cohomology connections ] shows that the singular structure given by the blow - ups in the solutions of the toda lattice contains information about the integral cohomology of real flag varieties @xcite .",
    "we begin with a detailed study of the solutions of the indefinite toda lattice hierarchy @xcite .",
    "the singular structure is determined by the set of zeros of the @xmath3-functions of the toda lattice .",
    "first we note that the image of the moment map of the isospectral variety is a convex polytope whose vertices are the orbit of the weyl group action @xcite .",
    "each vertex of the polytope corresponds to a fixed point of the toda lattice , and it represents a unique cell of the flag variety .",
    "each edge of the polytope can be considered as an orbit of the @xmath9 toda lattice ( the smallest nontrivial lattice ) , and it represents a simple reflection of the weyl group .",
    "there are two types of orbits , either regular ( without blow - ups ) or singular ( with blow - ups )",
    ". then one can define a graph , where the vertices are the fixed points of the toda lattice and where two fixed points are connected by an edge when the @xmath9 flow between them is regular .",
    "if the flow is singular , then there is no edge between the two points .",
    "the graph defined in this way turns out to be the incidence graph that gives the integral cohomology of the real flag variety , where the incidence numbers associated to the edges are either @xmath10 or @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "we also show that the total number of blow - ups in the flow of the toda lattice is related to the polynomial associated with the rational cohomology of a certain compact subgroup @xcite .",

    "we will describe the lie - poisson structure for the toda lattice equations ( [ symmetric lax equation ] ) in section [ full symmetric real toda lattice ] ; however , we do not need the symplectic structure explicitly here .",
    "moser @xcite analyzes the dynamics of the toda particles , showing that for any initial configuration , @xmath49 tends to @xmath50 as @xmath51 .",

    "the analysis in @xcite shows that @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the physical interpretation of this is that as @xmath55 , the particles @xmath56 approach the velocities @xmath57 , and as @xmath58 , the velocities are interchanged so that @xmath59",

    "we also mention the notion of the @xmath3-functions which play a key role of the theory of integrable systems ( see for example @xcite ) .",

    "notice that the hessenberg and symmetric lax formulations of ( [ toda equations ] ) are simply different ways of expressing the same system .",
    "the solutions exist for all time and exibit the same behavior as @xmath51 in both cases .",
    "however , when we generalize the toda lattice to allow the subdiagonal entries to take on any real value , the symmetric and hessenberg forms differ in their geometry and topology and in the character of their solutions .      consider again the lax equation @xmath101 \\ , \\label{symmetric lax}\\ ] ] where we now extend the set of matrices @xmath30 of the form ( [ symmetric ] ) by allowing @xmath102 to take on any real value .",

    ", the inverse scattering method can be used on the open dense subset where all @xmath102 are nonzero .",
    "this is because a real matrix @xmath30 of the form ( [ symmetric ] ) has distinct real eigenvalues if @xmath42 for all @xmath6 .",
    "the eigenvalues are real because @xmath30 is a real symmetric matrix ; the fact that they are distinct follows from the tridiagonal form with nonzero @xmath102 , which forces there to be one eigenvector ( up to a scalar ) for each eigenvalue .",
