    "the t82 data , together with the 3 khz signals detected by voyager in the outer heliosphere @xcite , represent the primary evidence for the interstellar magnetic field direction at the solar location and are both consistent with a field direction towards @xmath1480 .",
    "if my interpretation is correct , sensitive polarization observations over the 22-year magnetic solar cycle should monitor the outer heliosheath and detect variations in the interactions of these charged grains with the heliosphere .",
    "small charged grains capable of polarizing starlight are magnetically coupled to the interstellar magnetic field that is excluded from the heliosphere . for reasonable estimates of the far ultraviolet radiation field , which causes photoelectric charging of the isdgs , and interstellar magnetic field strengths greater than 1.5 @xmath1 g , dust grains with radii @xmath00.10.2 @xmath1 m couple to the interstellar magnetic field at the heliosphere .",

    "the polarization for 13 stars with @xmath46 is @xmath47 deg , while the average polarization for the 12 stars with @xmath48 is @xmath49 deg .",
    "applying the student t - test to these two samples gives an estimate , at the 98% confidence level , that the polarizations for these two samples are not drawn from a single sample with randomly distributed polarizations .",
    "thus , the anticorrelation between polarization and @xmath3 , for @xmath50 , appears real .",

    "the anomalously high values of @xmath53 + 0.5 , found at @xmath460 , are dominated by the two non - variable stars hd 38393 ( f7 v , 9 pc ) and hd 40136 ( f1 v , 15 pc ) , located near ( , ) @xmath4 ( 223,22 . ) , and with @xmath5615 10@xmath26 degrees .",
    "the central direction of the  cone ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , top ) corresponds to a minimum in the polarization strength , and it extends for @xmath415 . since grains in the dust cone are larger than typical grains which polarize optical light @xcite , this minimum , although marginally significant , could be explained if real .",

    "[ fig:1 ] shows clearly that the region of maximum dust inflow is offset from the region of maximum dust alignment .    in contrast , if one assumes a purely interstellar origin for the polarization , and applies standard ism values ( @xmath570.03 , @xmath58=3.1 , and @xmath59(h)/@xmath60=5.8 x 10@xmath61 ) , then a 1@xmath25 polarization corresponds to a cloud column density of @xmath59(h)@xmath44 x 10@xmath62  for a magnetic field perpendicular to the sightline .",
    "this value is consistent with expected amount of nearby upwind interstellar gas ; for instance , toward 36 oph @xmath59(hi)=7.1 10@xmath63 @xcite , and the gas in this sightline may be partially ionized @xcite . this argument , in turn , implies a purely interstellar origin for the polarization , with a possible small polarization enhancement in heliosheath currents .",
    "however , in this case it is difficult to explain the ecliptic signatures on starlight polarization as shown in figs . 1 and 2",
    ". the gas - to - dust mass ratio is , in any case , uncertain for such small reddening values .",
    "isdg interactions with the outer heliosheath may depend on solar cycle phase . during solar minimum phases ,",
    "the heliospheric hi  glow should show a pronounced groove from the asymmetric momentum flux of the solar wind @xcite , compared to the more symmetric ( although smaller overall ) heliosphere during solar maximum .",
    "these differences in heliospheric morphology will affect the interstellar magnetic field and dust interactions with the heliosphere , and may explain the lack of confirmation of the t82 data by l93 .    for magnetically aligned isdgs in space ,",
    "the plane of polarization is parallel to , and maximum polarization will be seen for directions perpendicular to the field lines @xcite .",

    "the region of maximum polarization is centered near @xmath4295 , but several strongly polarized stars are seen at low latitudes between ( , ) @xmath4(280,10 ) and ( 32040 ) .",
    "the strong polarization in this region at low ecliptic latitudes , @xmath6540 , may originate in the low latitude extension of the magnetic wall resulting from the tilt of  with respect to the ecliptic plane .",
    "linde ( 1998 ) modeled the magnetic wall for the 1996 solar minimum , and found it stronger at southern latitudes where the azimuthal components of the interstellar and interplanetary fields are parallel , as compared to the northern hemisphere where they were antiparallel . the best aligned grains ( = 281330 )",
    "should trace compressed  field lines which stretch smoothly around the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "although the alignment mechanism is somewhat uncertain , polarization may be enhanced in the heliosheath nose by grain charging ( e.g. by the barnett effect ) and the tight coupling between the interstellar dust grains and the compressed  ( see the discussion of grain alignment in * ? ? ?",

    "however the 2@xmath25 uncertainties on the u / g flow direction extend to smaller  values , corresponding to = 210@xmath5285 .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows clearly that the region of maximum dust inflow ( large grains ) is offset from the region of maximum dust alignment ( deflected small grains ) .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows that the direction of maximum polarization , which should trace the magnetic wall , is inclined by a large angle to the ecliptic plane .",
    "this offset between aligned and inflowing grains also indicates that dust filtration reflects the asymmetric heliosphere configuration caused by , with the large - grain inflow showing the heliosphere nose , and the small grains showing the magnetic configuration of the outer heliosheath .    in principle , the relative distributions of the aligned dust , dust inflow , and  and  upwind directions ( see fig .

    "the ibex data on fast  and  neutral atoms formed in the heliosheath @xcite may map out this heliosphere asymmetry driven by the interstellar magnetic field , through observations of  and  fast neutrals , which have formation rates that depend on filtration factors .",
    "future precise observations of very weak polarization signals , with duplicate observations and using rotatable telescopes in the northern and southern hemispheres , may provide a useful monitor of the outer heliosheath region , and of the interaction between the solar and interstellar magnetic fields .",
    "detailed models of heliosphere grain alignment and trapping are required before these results can be fully understood .",
    "removing contributions from foreground emission is an important element in analyzing wmap composite maps @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a weak large scale contributions from the heliosphere indicates further modeling of this emission is warranted @xcite .",
    "the infrared emission from heliospheric interstellar dust appears much weaker than zodiacal emission , by factors of @xmath410@xmath19 ( f99 ) .",
    "however , the observed correlation with the ecliptic of the combined quadrupole - octopole signature found by @xcite in the wmap data , supports a possible contamination from isdgs interacting with the heliosphere .",
    "candidates for contamination include the small polarizing grains trapped in the magnetic wall , and discussed here ; current sheets in the outer heliosheath regions ; or alternatively from larger heated interstellar dust interacting with the solar wind .",
    "any contribution to the cosmic microwave background from small grains in the outer heliosheath regions should reflect the complex asymmetry of the heliosphere interacting with , including the magnetic wall , rather than echoing the more simple symmetry of the ecliptic plane .",
    "if the smaller grains , radii @xmath160.2 @xmath1 m , are responsible , the spatial distribution may show a variation with the solar cycle , such that the heliospheric contribution to the cosmic microwave signal could be recovered from sensitive polarization observations spaced throughout the 22 year magnetic solar cycle .",
