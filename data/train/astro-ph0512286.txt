    "the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) is a powerful probe to investigate the early universe .",
    "inflation , scalar ( density ) and tensorial ( gravitational waves ) primordial perturbations , and formation processes of first stars and galaxies can be effectively studied through its angular power spectra ( e.g. @xcite ) . the cmb polarization ( cmbp )",
    "can be expanded in a curl - free and a curl component called @xmath10 and @xmath11mode , respectively ( @xcite ; for an equivalent formalism see @xcite ) .",
    "these fully describe the polarized emission and have the advantage to be scalar quantities , differently from the stokes parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 that are components of a 2-spin tensor .",
    "the emission level of the @xmath10mode is a few per  cent of the cmb temperature anisotropy signal .",
    "first detections have been recently performed @xcite , but a full characterization is far from being completed . on subdegree scales , level and behaviour of the @xmath10-mode are well predicted by the standard model , provided a number of cosmological parameters are determined ( e.g. those of the _ concordance _ model after the wmap data set : @xcite ) .",
    "a precise measurement of the power spectrum thus represents a powerful check of the overall theoretical framework based on both the standard model and the inflation paradigm .",
    "foreground noise sources can compete with the cosmic signal and disturb the precise measurements needed for cmbp goals .",
    "estimates of contaminant emissions are then crucial to define the best observing conditions , as the identification of the frequency window in which the cosmic signal is accessible as a function of the sky position .",
    "these estimates also allow the determination of the foreground properties , which , in turn , greatly improve the effectiveness of foreground cleaning algorithms ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the diffuse synchrotron emission of the galaxy is considered one of the most relevant polarization contaminant and is expected to dominate the foreground contribution at frequencies less than 100-ghz .",
    "recent measurements performed in a low emission area at both 1.4 and 2.3-ghz indicate that the synchrotron signal does not represent an obstacle for the @xmath10mode at high galactic latitude and at frequencies higher than 30-ghz @xcite .",
    "however , this is just one sample that may not be representative of the situation throughout high galactic latitudes and other measurements in different areas are required to confirm this first evaluation .",
    "the second cmbp component , the @xmath11mode , is even fainter and no information which can help predict its level are available so far .",
    "in fact , within the inflation paradigm its level on degree scales is related to the amount of primordial tensor perturbations ( gravitational waves , gw ) generated in the early whiles of the universe by the inflation event ( e.g. see @xcite ) .",
    "usually , this gw amount is measured by the tensor - to - scalar perturbation power ratio @xmath15 and only upper limits are available so far ( @xmath19 , 95  per  cent confidence level : @xcite ) .",
    "the detection of the cmb @xmath11mode and the measure of its value are thus fundamental to disentangle among different inflation models and to measure their relevant parameters ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "estimates of the @xmath11mode emission of the foreground contaminants ( mainly synchrotron and dust emissions of the ism ) are crucial not only to identify clean sky areas , but also to understand the range of inflation models which can be explored through cmb measurements .",
    "the low emission area surveyed by @xcite was found promising also for the detection of this cmbp component .",
    "in fact , these authors find that models with a gw amount down to @xmath20 should be accessible in that area .",
    "however , as for the @xmath10mode , this is just one sample of the high galactic latitude conditions and measurements in other sky areas are needed to check whether this trend is general .",
    "high galactic latitude fields are promising for cmbp investigations for their low total intensity emission both by ism synchrotron and dust . among them , @xcite identify a couple of wide fields ( about @xmath21 ) as observing targets for the bar - sport experiment @xcite , one for each of the northern and southern celestial hemispheres .",
    "an area in the southern field has been observed by @xcite and @xcite , providing the results briefly reported above .    in this paper",
    "we present deep 1.4-ghz observations of an area in the northern field .",
    "centred at ra  =  @xmath1@xmath2 , dec  =  @xmath3@xmath4 ( b1950 ) , the observed area features very high galactic latitudes ( @xmath5  @xmath6  @xmath7 , @xmath8  @xmath6  @xmath9 ) , which should prevent the significant alterations of the polarized emission by faraday rotation possible at this frequency for @xmath22@xmath23@xcite .",
    "this leads to estimates of the @xmath10 and @xmath11mode power spectra which can be safely extrapolated to the frequency range relevant for cmb studies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ obssec ] we present details of the observations along with the discussion of the obtained maps . in section  [ specsec ]",
    "we provide the analysis of polarized angular power spectra .",
    "finally , in section  [ discsec ] we discuss the implications for cmbp measurements .",

    "a new 8-channel if - polarimeter was used , where a 32-mhz wide band was split into eight channels , 4-mhz wide each .",
    "an additional 36-mhz wide broad band channel includes the band covered by the @xmath24 mhz channels .",
    "the addition of this multi - channel polarimeter allows a more efficient rejection of narrow band interferences and the derivation of the rotation measure ( rm ) of polarized emission . the l - band receiver and its calibration",
    "was already described by @xcite .",
    "the receiver covers a wide frequency range between 1.29-ghz and 1.72-ghz , which , however , has the disadvantage of some cross - talk between the left and right  handed circular polarization band varying with frequency . by observing several polarized and unpolarized calibration sources for each observing night we found the correction factors for each channel . for each pixel the observed total intensity signal was multiplied by these factors and the result was subtracted from the corresponding @xmath17 and @xmath18 signals . that way residual instrumental polarization was reduced to below 1  per  cent of the total intensity .",
    "the main calibration source was 3c  286 assuming a flux density of 14.4-jy and 9.3  per  cent of linear polarization at a polarization angle of @xmath25 .",

    "the standard data reduction scheme for effelsberg continuum and polarization observations was applied including baseline corrections of the individual maps by using the unsharp masking procedure described by @xcite .",
    "five coverages were used ( for a total 10-s integration time per pixel ) , where the data from the wide broad band channel have been used .",
    "the five maps were subsequently combined using the _ plait _ algorithm as described by @xcite , which effectively destripes the maps .",

    "the comparison with the expected cmbp signal for different @xmath15 values suggests that the properties of inflation models with a gw amount as low as @xmath68 can be explored here , when only the synchrotron contribution is considered .",
    "this result is even better than the one obtained in the southern region , where @xmath15 values down to @xmath6  0.01 were estimated to be accessible .",
    "as already pointed out by @xcite , this low level of the polarized synchrotron emission can make the ism dust the major contaminant of cmbp at 90100  ghz .",
    "no estimate of the polarized dust emission is available in our region , and a real comparison is not possible .",

    "our area would be the upper limit obtained by @xcite with the data of the archeops experiment , our area being included in the sky region they surveyed . however , their result looks too pessimistic to be applied to our low emission area .",
    "in fact , besides being an upper limit , it refers to the whole @xmath72 portion of the region mapped by that experiment .",
    "moreover , the value they provided ( 0.2-@xmath73k@xmath74 at 100-ghz ) is much higher than the upper limit deduced by @xcite relative to a large high galactic latitude area .",
    "instead , we prefer to use the dust total intensity measurements recently obtained at high galactic latitudes in the area surveyed with the 2003 boomerang experiment @xcite .",
    "they also find that the dust emission in that area is representative of a large fraction of the high latitude sky ( 40 per cent of the sky ) .",
    "as polarization fraction we consider both 5 and 20  per  cent , which brackets the 10  per  cent deduced by @xcite for the high galactic latitudes .",
    "the frequency behaviours are plotted in figure  [ foregfig ] , where the quantity @xmath75 at @xmath76 is used as good indicator of the emission on the @xmath71 scale of the @xmath11mode peak .",
    "the dust actually looks to be the leading contaminant at 90100  ghz , even assuming the case of 5  per  cent polarization . as a consequence , the best frequency window where the total foreground contamination is minimum can be _",
    "red_-shifted toward @xmath77  ghz , as it happens for the cmb anisotropy @xcite .",
    "to give an idea of the situation at 70-ghz , figure  [ speccmb_b_70_fig ] shows the synchrotron angular behaviour at such a frequency .    besides implications for the design of experiments devoted to the cmbp @xmath11-mode , such a red - shift implies a reduction of the dust contamination , because of its frequency behaviour . as a result , even considering the dust contribution , it should be possible to study models with @xmath16 , and even lower in case of 5  per  cent dust polarization . as mentioned above , this result is even better than that obtained in the other high galactic latitude area , also reported in figure  [ foregfig ] for comparison .",
    "although observations in other sky regions are needed , this suggests that the southern area is not a special case , and that the possibility to reach the @xmath16 value estimated to be achievable in the southern area could be extended to large low emission regions at high galactic latitudes .",
    "foreground cleaning techniques can allow further improvements of the measurable @xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite ) opening wide possibilities in the explorable inflation models , especially in view of the recent results of @xcite .",
    "in fact , these authors find that the interesting class of inflation models with minimal fine - tuning have @xmath78",
    ". only models with an high degree of fine - tuning can have @xmath15 values less than 0.001 .",
    "thus , perspectives to detect the @xmath11-mode in large low emission areas at high galactic latitudes become realistic .",
    "however , a better assessment of the scenario requires direct measures of the polarized dust emission , possibly at higher frequency ( hundreds of ghz ) where this galactic component is stronger .",
    "this work has been carried out in the framework of the bar - sport experiment , a programme funded by asi ( agenzia spaziale italiana ) .",

    "<S> we extrapolate the @xmath10mode spectrum up to 32-ghz and confirm the possibility to safely detect the cmbp @xmath10mode signal in the ka band found in another low emission region @xcite . extrapolated up to 90-ghz , the galactic synchrotron @xmath11mode looks to compete with the cosmic signal only for models with a tensor - to - scalar perturbation power ratio @xmath14 , which is even lower than the @xmath15 value of 0.01 found to be accessible in the only other high galactic latitude area investigated to date . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that values as low as @xmath16 might be accessed at high galactic latitudes . </S>",
    "<S> such low emission values can allow a significant _ red_-shift of the best frequency to detect the cmbp @xmath11mode , also reducing the contamination by galactic dust , and opening interesting perspectives to investigate inflation models .    </S>",
