    "thanks to recent technological advances in producing high - quality polarized monochromatic photon beams , and in developing polarized nucleon targets , it becomes possible to measure a sufficiently large amount of single- and double - polarization observables in pion and kaon photoproduction from the nucleon . as a result ,",
    "a status of complete quantum mechanical information of meson photoproduction comes within reach .",
    "measurements are complete whenever they enable one to determine unambiguously all amplitudes of the underlying reaction process at some specific kinematics .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 reaction as a prototypical example of pseudoscalar - meson photoproduction from the proton .",
    "the transversity amplitudes @xmath1 express the transition matrix elements in terms of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 spinors ( with quantization axis perpendicular to the reaction plane ) and of linear photon polarizations @xmath4 .",
    "we propose @xcite to use normalized transversity amplitudes ( nta ) @xmath5 to perform an amplitude analysis of the single- and double- polarization observables .",
    "the nta provide complete information after determining the differential cross section .",
    "the corresponding polarization observables can be expressed in terms of linear and nonlinear equations of bilinear products of the @xmath6 . for a given kinematical setting determined by the meson angle @xmath7 and the invariant mass @xmath8 , the @xmath9",
    "are fully determined by six real numbers conveniently expressed as three real moduli @xmath10 and three real relative phases @xmath11 .",
    "all observables are invariant under a transformation of the type @xmath12 , with @xmath13 an arbitrarily chosen overall phase . in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] we show predictions for the nta at @xmath14  mev and various @xmath7 .",
    "the adopted model for @xmath15 is the regge - plus - resonance ( rpr ) approach in its most recent version rpr-2011 @xcite .",
    "the model has a reggeized @xmath16-channel background and the @xmath17-channel resonances @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the rpr approach provides a low - parameter framework with predictive power for @xmath25 and @xmath26 photoproduction on the proton and the neutron @xcite .",
    "an obvious advantage of using the transversity amplitudes is that linear equations connect the moduli @xmath28 of the nta to the single - polarization observables @xmath29 @xmath30 accordingly , a measurement of @xmath31 at given @xmath32 allows one to infer the moduli @xmath33 of the nta .",
    "the graal collaboration provides @xmath34 data for @xmath35 at 66 @xmath36 combinations in the ranges @xmath37  gev ( @xmath38 mev ) and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "figure  [ f2 ] shows the extracted @xmath28 at three @xmath7 intervals along with the rpr-2011 predictions .",
    "for a few kinematic points the @xmath41 could not be retrieved from the data .",
    "this occurs whenever one or more arguments of the square roots in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) become negative due to finite experimental error bars .",
    "the rpr-2011 model offers a fair description of the @xmath8 dependence of the extracted @xmath41 except for the most forward angles at @xmath42  gev .",
    "furthermore , the data confirm the predicted dominance of the @xmath43 .",
    "inferring the nta phases @xmath44 from data requires measured double asymmetries .",
    "complete sets of the first kind , which involve seven observables ( e.g. @xmath45 ) , lead to the following set of nonlinear equations for the phases @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "solutions to the above set of nonlinear equations gives the phases @xmath49 for given moduli @xmath50 .",
    "we stress that single - polarization observables are part of any complete set as they provide the information about the moduli .",
    "double polarization observables are required to get access to the phases . in all practical situations one has @xmath51 .",
    "finite error bars introduce a bias for the choices made with regard to the reference phase ( here , @xmath52 ) for the above equations .",
    "a consistent set of estimators @xmath53 for the independent phases ( insensitive to choices made with regard to the reference phase ) has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "to date , the published double polarization observables for @xmath15 do not allow one to extract the phases of the nta .",
    "we have conducted studies with pseudo - data generated by the rpr-2011 model for @xmath0 .",
    "we have considered ensembles of 200 pseudo - data sets each containing samples of 50 events for the asymmetries @xmath54 .",
    "the pseudo - data are drawn from gaussians with the rpr-2011 prediction as mean and a given @xmath55 as standard deviation .",
    "the retrieved @xmath56 do not necessarily comply with the input amplitudes .",
    "there are various sources of error : ( i ) imaginary solutions for the moduli ; ( ii ) imaginary solutions for the phases ; ( iii ) incorrect solutions which stem from the fact that @xmath57 can not be exactly obeyed for data with finite errors .",
    "we find that the amount of incorrect and imaginary solutions is much larger for the phases than for the moduli .",
    "the frequency of finding imaginary solutions can be dramatically reduced by improving on the experimental resolution @xmath55 .",
    "we have sketched a possible roadmap for reaching a status of complete information in pseudoscalar - meson photoproduction .",
    "we suggest that the use of transversity amplitudes is tailored to the situation that experimental information about @xmath58 is more abundant ( and most often more precise ) than for the double polarization observables .",
    "linear equations connect @xmath59 to the moduli @xmath28 of the nta .",
    "an analysis of @xmath60 data for @xmath61 from graal allowed us to extract the @xmath28 in the majority of considered @xmath62 combinations .",
    "extracting the nta independent phases is far more challenging as they are connected to the double asymmetries by means of nonlinear equations .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that over - complete sets which involve more than seven polarization observables may provide a solution to tackle the problem of extracting the relative phases of the amplitudes from the data .",
