    "@xmath19 , which is negative when either @xmath20 or @xmath21 vanishes , will fail to be everywhere negative if and only if the equation @xmath22 has a solution . this gives , in effect , a quadratic equation in @xmath23 .",

    "( [ criterionone ] ) in any of these forms hides its symmetry among @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath9 . by expanding it out and expressing everything in terms of standard invariants ,",
    "we get a manifestly symmetric expression : @xmath33 we will give another , more geometric derivation of this version of the criterion at the end of this section .",
    "_ case one : criterion met _",
    "if the chronology criterion is met , then we can find @xmath20 , @xmath21 such that @xmath34 in terms of @xmath10 , we can express this condition in the manifestly symmetric form @xmath35    in eqn .",
    "( [ interpretationtwo ] ) , without significant loss of generality we may assume @xmath36 , @xmath37 . since the 4-vector @xmath38 is timelike or lightlike , the sign of its time coordinate is the same in all frames .",
    "let us say it is positive",
    ". then it can never be the case that @xmath9 comes after _ both _ @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; for if @xmath39 _ and _ @xmath40 we would have @xmath41 , contrary to hypothesis .",
    "@xmath9 can still occur either after @xmath2 or after @xmath3 ( though not both ) , so there must exist frames in which the chronology is @xmath42 and others in which it is @xmath43 .",
    "because the space of boosts is connected , and the mapping from it onto time orderings of @xmath10 is continuous , we must be able to interpolate between possible orderings through swaps of adjoining letters .",
    "thus the intermediate orderings @xmath44 and @xmath45 will also occur .",
    "( note that all three events can not be simultaneous in any frame . )    in the degenerate case when @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath9 lie on a line , one of them , say @xmath3 , lies between the others . in this case only the time orderings @xmath46 or @xmath44 , or complete equality , are possible .    summing up : if the criterion eqn .",
    "( [ criterionthree ] ) is met , then the possible chronologies among the events @xmath10 are restricted in an interesting way .",
    "generically , either there is one event that can not occur before both the others , or there is one event that can not occur after both the others ; within either alternative , all chronologies consistent with the stated constraint occur in some frame .",
    "_ case two : criterion unmet _",
    "if the criterion ( [ criterionone ] ) is not met , then the plane spanned by @xmath47 , @xmath48 consists entirely of spacelike vectors . we can choose a frame such that a timelike vector normal to this plane defines the direction of time .",
    "in that frame , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath9 are simultaneous .",
    "by making small hyperbolic rotations about the axis through @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( i.e. boosts in directions perpendicular to @xmath49 ) we can make @xmath9 occur slightly earlier or later , without changing the time coordinates of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . combining operations of this kind ,",
    "clearly we can find frames in which @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath9 occur in any chronological order",
    ".    _ geometric formulation _",
    "as we proceed , a more geometric formulation of the chronology criterion will prove useful .",
    "satisfaction of the criterion ( [ criterionone ] ) implies that the subspace spanned by @xmath50 and @xmath51 contains timelike or lightlike vectors .",
    "because any vector orthogonal to a timelike vector must be spacelike , it follows that the subspace orthogonal to @xmath50 and @xmath51 must consist entirely of spacelike vectors .",
    "( we leave the lightlike case to the reader . )",
    "let @xmath52 and @xmath53 be two mutually orthogonal 4-vectors spanning this subspace ; then @xmath54 squaring both sides gives @xmath55 since we have assumed that @xmath56 .",
    "the proportionality constant after squaring is positive , so the expressions on both sides of the last equation have the same sign .",
    "it follows that if @xmath52 and @xmath53 are both spacelike , then the expression on the right side is strictly positive  this is precisely the chronology criterion .",
    "conversely if the chronology criterion is satisfied then @xmath52 and @xmath53 must both be spacelike , since , being orthogonal , they can not both be timelike .",
    "these considerations suggest a way of rewriting the symmetric version of the chronology criterion , eqn .",
    "( [ criterionthree ] ) , in a more compact form .",
    "first express the right side of eqn .",
    "( [ wedges ] ) in terms of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 : @xmath57=*(a\\wedge b + b\\wedge c + c\\wedge a),\\ ] ] then square to obtain the chronology criterion in the form @xmath58 this expression has the nice feature that although it involves the events themselves , as opposed to their differences , it is manifestly invariant under a common translation @xmath59 . expanded out , eqn .",
    "( [ criterionfour ] ) reproduces eqn .",
    "( [ criterionthree ] ) precisely .",
    "it is natural to attempt to generalize the above considerations to more than 3 events , and to spacetimes of other dimensions .    in the case of four events in 3 + 1 dimensions",
    ", one can give a similar geometric criterion for when they can be placed in arbitrary time order : generically , four events @xmath60 uniquely define a three - dimensional hyperplane .",
    "if the normal vector to this hyperplane is timelike , then a frame can be chosen in which the normal vector lies entirely in the time direction ; in this frame the four events are simultaneous , and small lorentz boosts can be made to achieve any of the 24 possible time - orderings of @xmath60 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the normal vector is spacelike then the hyperplane will contain a timelike vector and not all orderings will be realized . to enumerate all possible cases one must also consider whether each triple of events @xmath61 , @xmath62 , etc . ,",
    "meets or fails to meet the chronology criterion of the previous section .",
    "a more detailed analysis appears in the appendix .    in general",
    ", one can not order more than four events arbitrarily in 3 + 1 dimensions . indeed , with five events , the four difference vectors @xmath63 etc .",
    "will generically span spacetime , so that their span will include timelike vectors , leading to constraints on the possible chronologies that can arise .",
    "the problem then breaks up into a number of cases and subcases corresponding to whether each of the subsets containing 4 events or 3 events satisfies its own chronology criterion .",
    "this direct approach to the enumeration of all possible constraints quickly becomes unmanageable as the number of events increases . to address that problem",
    "we can make use of a more powerful formulation due to heiligman @xcite and stanley @xcite , based on the theory of hyperplane arrangements .    _ hyperplane arrangements _    to investigate the possible orderings of @xmath11 events in @xmath64-dimensional minkowski space , we consider the set of all inertial reference frames related by a simple lorentz boost , parameterized by the boost velocity @xmath65 with respect to a fiducial reference frame .",
    "( we ignore the effects of spatial rotations , since these do not change time orderings . )",
    "physical velocities are those velocities with magnitude less than the speed of light , @xmath66 . for the moment",
    ", we do not impose this restriction on the set of @xmath65 .    in this @xmath67-dimensional velocity space @xmath68 , any two events @xmath69 and",
    "@xmath70 define an @xmath71-dimensional hyperplane of simultaneity , which we denote @xmath72 , consisting of those boosts which define reference frames in which @xmath69 and @xmath70 are simultaneous .",
    "on one side of the hyperplane , @xmath69 occurs before @xmath70 ; on the other side , the ordering is reversed . if @xmath69 and @xmath70 are spacelike separated , the hyperplane @xmath72 intersects the ball of physical velocities @xmath73 , which is a representation of the well - known fact that physical reference frames exist that realize either time - ordering of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath69 and @xmath70 are timelike separated , their time - ordering can be reversed by means of a boost with @xmath74 . for simplicity",
    ", we ignore the case of lightlike separated @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    now",
    "consider @xmath11 events @xmath75 , @xmath76 @xmath77 in @xmath78 .",
    "each pair of events @xmath79 defines a hyperplane @xmath72 .",
    "the @xmath80 distinct hyperplanes divide @xmath68 up into distinct regions , corresponding to distinct time - orderings of @xmath75 , @xmath76 @xmath77 .",
    "the time - orderings realizable by physical lorentz boosts , i.e. , boosts with velocity @xmath66 , correspond to those regions that intersect the interior of the sphere @xmath81 .",
    "the intersection of two or more hyperplanes @xmath72 is a hyperplane of higher codimension , along which more than two events are simultaneous .",
    "for example , along the intersection of @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 are simultaneous , and so are @xmath86 and @xmath87 , but the relative ordering of the first and second pairs of events are not determined .",
    "we denote this intersection by @xmath88 . as another example , consider the intersection of @xmath82 and @xmath89 , where @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 are simultaneous .",
    "hence @xmath90 also passes through this intersection .",
    "we denote the intersection of these three hyperplanes by @xmath91 .",
    "likewise , the intersection of @xmath92 is written as @xmath93 .",
    "an obvious extension of this notation shows that higher hyperplane intersections are in correspondence with partitions of @xmath11 integers 1 , 2 , @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the partition @xmath95 corresponds to the hyperplane intersection @xmath96 , along which @xmath97 are simultaneous and @xmath87 and @xmath98 are simultaneous .",
    "( in writing partitions , we will generally neglect blocks consisting of a single integer . )    in @xmath67-dimensional velocity space , any set of @xmath99 hyperplanes @xmath72 will generically have a nonempty intersection .",
    "generic intersections are in one - to - one correspondence with partitions containing at least @xmath100 blocks @xcite . for example , intersections of 3 hyperplanes , like @xmath91 , are generic in @xmath101 dimensions , since the partition @xmath102 contains @xmath103 blocks .",
    "note that it is _ not _ true that @xmath104 hyperplanes may intersect generically _ only if _",
    "@xmath99 ; for example , the intersection @xmath105 is generic , but is actually the intersection of @xmath106 hyperplanes .    following @xcite",
    ", we will restrict attention to generic hyperplane arrangements , in which only generic intersections occur . then , close to a generic intersection @xmath107 , an infinitesimal lorentz boost may be found which places @xmath108 in any arbitrary relative order , as well as @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 , and so on .",
    "the total number of distinct regions in velocity space has been computed usingm the combinatoric theory of hyperplane arrangements @xcite .",
    "the result @xmath112 involves the signless stirling number of the first kind , @xmath113 , which counts the number of permutations of @xmath11 elements with @xmath114 distinct cycles .",
    "@xmath115 counts just the trivial permutation and @xmath116 is the number of simple permutations @xmath117 .    in general , not all of these regions will intersect the physical region @xmath66 .",
    "the total number of physical time - orderings is therefore bounded above by the total number of regions : @xmath118    for illustration , consider the case of three events @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the three lines of simultaneity @xmath82 , @xmath90 , @xmath89 intersect at a point , @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath91 lies inside the circle @xmath81 then a physical frame exists in which the three events are simultaneous .",
    "the 3 lines divide the interior of the circle into 6 regions , corresponding to the 6 distinct time - orderings of the three events ( figure 1 ) .",
    "thus all possible time - orderings are realized in this case .",
    "if @xmath91 lies outside @xmath81 but the interior of the circle still has nonempty intersection with the 3 lines of simultaneity , then the interior of the circle is divided into 4 regions , as shown in figure 2 . if the circle only intersects with one line of simultaneity , then only two of the three events  the two events associated with that line  are spacelike separated . in general if @xmath72 lies outside of @xmath81 , the corresponding two events are timelike separated .",
    "events @xmath114 and @xmath119 are simultaneous .",
    "events 1 , 2 , and 3 are simultaneous at @xmath91 .",
    "time orderings of the three events in each region are indicated . ]    in @xmath120 dimensions the story for 3 events is essentially the same ; 3 hyperplanes of simultaneity @xmath82 , @xmath90 , @xmath89 intersect along a line @xmath91 .",
    "this case was considered in section 1 , where we found that generically all 6 orderings are realized when there is a timelike vector normal to the plane spanned by the 3 events ; otherwise at most 4 orderings could arise .",
    "in fact the existence of such a normal vector is completely equivalent to the condition of @xmath91 intersecting the interior of the sphere @xmath81 ; and if @xmath91 lies just outside the sphere ( so that @xmath82 , @xmath90 , @xmath89 still intersect the sphere and the 3 events are still spacelike separated ) then generically 4 time - orderings are realized , as in fig .  2 .    . the physical region @xmath66 may intersect 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 6 time - ordering regions , depending on the location of the circle .",
    "the case shown corresponds to the example of 3 events satisfying the chronology condition , as discussed in section 1 . ]",
    "a typical configuration with four events @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 in @xmath101 dimensions is shown in figure 3 .",
    "@xmath121 bound a triangular region ; the remaining 3 @xmath72 bisect the 3 angles of the triangle .",
    "now there are a total of six lines of simultaneity , which divide velocity space into 18 regions , each corresponding to a distinct ordering of the 4 events .",
    "there are three double intersection points of the form @xmath88 , and four triple intersection points like @xmath122 .",
    "there is an eight - parameter space of possible diagrams of the type shown in figure 3 , parameterized by the locations of the four triple intersection points in the 2d velocity space .",
    "the eight parameters correspond to the coordinates of the four events , modulo translations and overall scalings .",
    "as the eight moduli for the four events are varied , the locations of the triple intersection points range arbitrarily over @xmath68 .        when a triple intersection point passes from the interior to the exterior of the circle , the number of distinct regions inside the circle decreases ( generically ) by two .",
    "when a line or a double intersection point passes to the exterior of the circle , the number of regions intersecting the interior of the circle decreases by one .",
    "the total number of regions inside the circle is thus equal to @xmath123 where @xmath124 denotes the number of lines of simultaneity inside the circle , @xmath125 is the number of triple intersection points , etc .",
    "this formula is valid for arbitrarily many events @xmath11 in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "in @xmath13 dimensions , the above formula gets generalized to @xmath126 } s(h_{\\pi[k]})\\ ] ] where the sum is over all partitions of @xmath11 corresponding to hyperplanes intersecting with the interior of the physical sphere @xmath81 , and @xmath127 is a weight factor that counts the number of regions `` lost '' when such an intersection passes from the interior to the exterior of the sphere .",
    "the trivial partition @xmath128 , corresponding to the whole space @xmath78 , contributes 1 to the sum . a partition with one nontrival component @xmath129 contributes @xmath130 , because when the corresponding intersection passes outside of the physical sphere , the lost regions correspond to orderings where a particular event occurs before ( or after ) all the others , and there are @xmath130 such orderings .",
    "note that @xmath130 is equal to the number of distinct cyclic permutations associated with this partition .",
    "it is easy to see that this fact generalizes , and @xmath127 is equal to the number of distinct cyclic permutations associated with the partition @xmath131 $ ] . in this way",
    ", one can enumerate all the possible orderings , for any set of events in any number of dimensions , by examining all the hyperplane intersections inside of the physical sphere . as a special case ,",
    "when the physical circle is large enough that all hyperplane intersections are generic , and all of them intersect the interior of the physical sphere , the number of possible orderings is maximal and equal to @xmath132 recovering the result of @xcite mentioned earlier .",
    "the series ( [ maxorderings ] ) terminates with @xmath133 because the minimum number of blocks in a partition corresponding to a generic intersection of hyperplanes is @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "in the minkowski geometry of events , appropriate to special relativity , one studies relations among events that are invariant under poincare transformations ( translations , spatial rotations , and boosts ) .",
    "an example of such an invariant relation is the time ordering among timelike and lightlike - separated events ; this extends to a partial ordering on the whole of minkowski space , with respect to which spacelike separated events are unordered @xcite .",
    "this partial ordering leads to an invariant notion of `` betweenness '' , according to which an event is said to occur between two timelike - separated events if it lies in the intersection of the future light - cone of the earlier event with the past light - cone of the later event .    in any particular realization of minkowski spacetime",
    "there is a natural ( noninvariant ) ordering of _ all _ events , given by projection onto the time coordinate .",
    "we call betweenness relations defined with respect to such a projection chronologies .",
    "one might have thought that the chronologies of spacelike separated events would be entirely frame - dependent  as they are for two events .",
    "but we have found that nontrivial , frame - independent chronological constraints appear even in surprisingly simple , otherwise unstructured situations .    to place these notions in a more general context , consider any vector space @xmath134 with an inner product",
    ". then we can impose an ordering of points in @xmath134 , i.e. vectors , analogous to chronologies of events in minkowski space , according to their inner products with a fixed vector . by considering all possible such orderings",
    ", we arrive at invariant notions generalizing betweenness , analogous to our constraints on chronologies . for up",
    "to @xmath135 generic points in @xmath136 dimensions there is no constraint , but for larger numbers of points constraints do arise , for reasons of convexity .",
    "for example , given a set of @xmath137 points in @xmath134 consider the minimal convex set containing them - their convex hull .",
    "this can be defined as the intersection of all half - spaces containing the @xmath137 points .",
    "( a half - space is a set composed of all points in @xmath134 which are either @xmath138 or @xmath139 a given point , with respect to one of the orderings defined above . )",
    "then any point lying in the interior of the convex hull will be subject to an ordering constraint .",
    "namely , it can not be less than or greater than all the other points in any coordinate ordering ; it must lie between events on the boundary of the hull , a sort of generalized  betweenness \" relation .",
    "further constraints are obtained by considering subsets of the original @xmath137 points .",
    "a more general condition tells us whether or not an ordering can be found for which a point @xmath140 is less than all of @xmath141 but greater than all of @xmath142 .",
    "such an ordering exists if and only if the intersection of the convex hull of @xmath143 and the convex hull of @xmath144 is simply @xmath145 . by",
    "well - known hyperplane separation theorems @xcite , this condition is equivalent to the existence of a hyperplane containing @xmath140 , separating the convex hull of @xmath146 from the convex hull of @xmath147 .",
    "the coordinate normal to such a hyperplane produces the desired ordering .    now specializing to minkowski space",
    ", we can formulate an analogous condition for the existence of time - orderings in terms of appropriate notions of convexity .",
    "define the future ( past ) convex hull of a set of events to be the convex hull of the future ( past ) light cones of those events .",
    "the future convex hull of a set of events may also be described as the intersection of the futures of all spacelike hyperplanes whose futures contain all the events in the set .",
    "future and past convex hulls are invariant under changes of frame , and can be used to define invariant ordering relations .",
    "for example , a point in the interior of the past convex hull of a set of events will not occur after all of those events in any reference frame .",
    "more generally , a necessary and sufficient condition that there be a chronology in which @xmath148 occur after @xmath149 , is that the intersection of the future convex hull of @xmath150 with the past convex hull of @xmath151 be empty .",
    "this condition guarantees that a hyperplane separating the two convex sets exists .",
    "such a hyperplane is automatically spacelike ; if it were not , then it would contain timelike rays , which would intersect any light cone in the future or past convex hulls .",
    "the coordinate normal to such a hyperplane is thus timelike , and produces the desired time - ordering .",
    "the picture in velocity space is as follows .",
    "the condition that @xmath150 occur before @xmath151 is equivalent to @xmath152 conditions @xmath153 , and is thus associated with a region in @xmath68 bounded by @xmath152 hyperplanes @xmath154 .",
    "this convex region is the intersection of the half - spaces in @xmath68 corresponding to each of the conditions @xmath153 . in any frame corresponding to a point in this region ,",
    "the conditions @xmath153 are automatically satisfied , and there is a constant - time hypersurface separating the @xmath2 s from the @xmath3 s .",
    "thus , if and only if this region intersects the unit sphere , a physical frame exists in which an ordering of the desired type is achieved .    to close this section let us reconsider our original example of three spacelike separated points , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath9 , in this more general context , and show how the separation theorem of the preceding paragraph reproduces the chronology condition ( [ criterionone ] ) .",
    "suppose the ordering @xmath155 is impossible .",
    "then ( after bringing @xmath3 to the origin by a translation ) , the convexity criterion states that the convex body spanned by the past light cones of @xmath49 and the origin intersects the convex body spanned by the future light cones of @xmath156 and the origin nontrivially .",
    "let @xmath65 be an event in the intersection ; we then have @xmath157 where @xmath158 are lightlike or timelike vectors with @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 .",
    "it follows that @xmath162 is lightlike or timelike , since all terms on the right side are future - directed lightlike or timelike vectors ; thus the chronology criterion is met . by the same reasoning ,",
    "if the chronology criterion is unmet then the relevant intersections will be trivial for all orderings , and each ordering will be achieved in some frame .",
    "thus far we have regarded the spacetime metric as given , and studied the chronologies it supports . to round out our discussion , we will now ask a sort of converse : given knowledge of all allowed chronologies , to what extent can we reconstruct the metric ? ( first , a disclaimer : extraction of metric data from causal data has been one of the central programs of the causal set approach to quantum gravity and its cousins @xcite , where in particular it has been shown that the metric can be reconstructed , up to a conformal factor , from a knowledge of the ordering relationships between timelike and lightlike separated points .",
    "indeed , the program of reconstructing geometry from causality dates back at least to the robb s work of 1914 @xcite .",
    "we are aware that in the first part of this section we are essentially rederiving a known result from a special perspective . )    to be more precise , the mathematical form of our problem is as follows .",
    "we want to consider spacetimes that support lorentz symmetry .",
    "this means that our spacetime comes equipped with a quadratic form @xmath163 of signature @xmath164 .",
    "@xmath163 , regarded as a matrix , is related to the usual minkowski metric @xmath165 by a similarity transformation @xmath166 corresponding to a gl@xmath167 transformation @xmath168 on the spacetime . then @xmath169 is invariant under an so@xmath170 group of transformations of the form @xmath171 here @xmath172 , obeying @xmath173 , is a lorentz transformation in the standard form .",
    "our problem is to reconstruct , from the chronologies our spacetime supports , its particular @xmath169 .",
    "we shall show that it is always possible to do this , up to an overall constant ; that is obviously the most that could be hoped for .",
    "our reconstruction of the metric will employ chronology conditions to identify , by self - consistency requirements , the coordinates of events in a frame where the metric is diagonal and of the form @xmath174 the reconstruction proceeds by a four - step process :    1 .",
    "a maximal set of simultaneity is a set of events that all occur at the same time in some frame , but is not contained in any larger set of that kind .",
    "maximal sets of simultaneity are surfaces of constant time in some frame .",
    "pick such a set .",
    "2 .   the maximal sets of simultaneity that do not intersect the set chosen in step 1 are the other surfaces of constant time in the frame chosen in step 1 . in that frame , or in any frame that leaves the same set of maximal sets of simultaneity invariant , the chronological ordering among the surfaces",
    "is fixed by the chronology of any events within the corresponding surfaces .",
    "so now we have a foliation by space - like hyperplanes , and an ordering of those surfaces , but not yet any metric structure .",
    "3 .   let @xmath140 be an event in one time hyperplane , which we give the coordinate @xmath175 .",
    "the solid future light - cone of @xmath140 can be defined purely chronologically , as the set of events that occur after @xmath140 in all chronologies ; similarly the solid past light - cone of @xmath176 is the set of events that occur before @xmath176 in all chronologies .",
    "choose another time hyperplane , coming after @xmath177 in the chosen frame , and label it @xmath178 .",
    "now consider the projections of past solid light - cones emanating from events @xmath176 on constant - time hyperplanes between @xmath179 , and compare them with the projection of the future solid light - cone of @xmath140 .",
    "there will be exactly one point @xmath176 , and one hyperplane , for which these projections coincide .",
    "that will occur when @xmath176 occurs at the same spatial coordinate as @xmath140 ( in the preferred frame ) and for the hyperplane whose time is the average @xmath180 ( in the preferred frame ) .",
    "we can iterate the process , finding hyperplanes with @xmath181 , @xmath182 , and points on these planes that have the same spatial position .",
    "we can also extend the construction by bringing in hyperplanes outside the interval @xmath179 in the construction of this step .",
    "thus we can construct world - lines of stationary observers in the chosen frame ; and establish the appropriate measure of time - intervals on each such world - line .",
    "finally we can construct the spatial distance - function in each hyperplane , as follows .",
    "let @xmath140 and @xmath176 be points on the same stationary - observer world - line , as constructed in step 3 , and let the time interval between them be @xmath183 . if @xmath184 is an event in the hyperplane of @xmath176 , we assign spatial distance @xmath183 between @xmath184 and @xmath176 if @xmath184 is in the solid future light - cone of @xmath140 , but not in the solid future light - cone of any event along the stationary - observer world - line lying in the interval between @xmath140 and @xmath176 . in this way , varying @xmath140 and @xmath176 , we can determine the spatial distance between any two points .",
    "thus considerations of chronology allow us to identify a coordinate system in which the metric is diagonal and of the form @xmath185 .",
    "the only arbitrariness arose in the choice of @xmath186 ; due to that circumstance , the metric has been determined up to an overall constant .",
    "since any lorentzian spacetime can be approximated locally by minkowski spacetime , and our arguments are essentially local , our result can be taken over to that more general context . in each local patch",
    ", we consider time coordinates that match the local flat - space time , i.e. flows generated by approximate time - like killing vector fields . then we ve shown that chronology conditions determine the metric up to a conformal factor , i.e. a position - dependent scale .",
    "it is possible that more detailed considerations , quantifying the notion of approximate timelike killing vector fields and paying careful attention to the ( competing ) effects of curvature in the small , would allow a complete reconstruction of metric from chronology , up to an overall constant , even in a curved spacetime . leaving that possibility to future work ,",
    "in the next section we will consider a looser extension of chronology relations to curved spacetimes , allowing for a much wider class of time variables .",
    "so far we have considered flat spacetime and , as is natural in that context , only allowed time slicings which respect the symmetry of flat spacetime . when we pass to the curved spacetimes of general relativity , it is natural to allow for more flexible definitions of time coordinates .",
    "we only require that the surfaces of constant `` time '' be spacelike , i.e. that their tangent vectors are all spacelike , or equivalently that their normal vectors are timelike . in this context",
    "the notion of convexity , which was central in flat spacetime , falls away .",
    "indeed even the bare possibility of introducing monotonic chronologies is not guaranteed for arbitrary manifolds of lorentz signature ; famously , one can encounter closed timelike loops . in order to find a recognizable generalization of our flat - space result , we focus on a broad class of spacetimes that has long been considered in connection with questions involving causality , the _ strongly causal",
    "_ spacetimes @xcite . for our purposes",
    ", we can take as the defining property of a strongly causal spacetime a condition that is usually derived from ( and proved equivalent to ) other , more abstract conditions , to wit : one can define on the spacetime a function @xmath187 whose level surfaces are spacelike .",
    "we define the causal future of a set @xmath2 to be the set @xmath188 of all points that can be reached by a future - directed non - spacelike curve emanating from a point in @xmath2 . in minkowski space",
    ", @xmath188 is the union of all future light cones , with their interiors included , emanating from @xmath2 .",
    "similarly we define the causal past @xmath189 to be the set of all points that can be reached by a past - directed non - spacelike curve emanating from a point in @xmath3 .",
    "note that these are natural generalizations of the convex sets of section 3 to curved spacetimes ; @xmath188 may alternatively be defined to be the intersection of the futures of all spacelike hypersurfaces whose futures contain @xmath2 .",
    "we then assert : in a strongly causal spacetime , there is a time slicing in which every event in a set @xmath190 occurs after every event in another set @xmath191 if and only if @xmath188 is disjoint from @xmath189 .",
    "necessity is obvious ; we now indicate how one might demonstrate sufficiency .",
    "our construction has three parts .",
    "first , we define a particular spacelike surface @xmath192 , partly adapted to the geometry of @xmath193 and partly adapted to the foliation defined by @xmath187 , which separates @xmath188 from @xmath189 .",
    "second , we embed @xmath192 as a level surface of the flow of a quasi - time variable @xmath194 .",
    "the level surfaces of @xmath194 are spacelike , and its flow covers the entire spacetime . our @xmath194 is not quite a legitimate time variable , however , because an event can correspond to an interval of @xmath187 , rather than a single value",
    ". the third step , which we do not carry out , would be to perturb @xmath194 into a legitimate time variable .",
    "while we think it is highly plausible that this can be done , we have not proved it .",
    "let @xmath195 be the smallest value that @xmath187 assumes on @xmath2 , @xmath183 the largest value that @xmath187 assumes on @xmath3 , and @xmath186 the smallest value that @xmath187 assumes on @xmath3 .",
    "( note that it is possible to have @xmath196 . )",
    "let @xmath197 be less than @xmath198 .",
    "then we define @xmath199 to be the frontier of the union of the set of events with @xmath200 and @xmath189 ; thus over parts of its range @xmath199 will be the @xmath201 plane , and over other parts it will coincide with @xmath189 .",
    "@xmath199 is a non - timelike surface with @xmath188 on its future side and @xmath189 in its past or present . by a small deformation",
    "we can promote it to a spacelike surface @xmath192 that separates @xmath188 from @xmath189 ( and @xmath2 from @xmath3 ) .",
    "we begin to define a foliation of surfaces associated with the variable @xmath194 as follows :    * for @xmath202 , take the surface @xmath203 . * for @xmath204 ,",
    "take the surface defined by those events in @xmath192 with @xmath205 and those events in the past of @xmath192 with @xmath203 .",
    "we can describe the resulting @xmath206 flow from the point of view of a local observer whose timelike worldline follows the gradient flow of the function @xmath187 .",
    "suppose that the observer carries both a @xmath187 and a @xmath194 clock with him .",
    "prior to reaching the surface @xmath192 , the @xmath194 and @xmath187 clocks coincide . upon hitting @xmath192 ,",

    "the @xmath207 surface is @xmath192 .",
    "if @xmath208 we can complete the construction of @xmath194 surfaces according to the following procedure :    * for @xmath209 , take the hypersurface composed of those events in the future of @xmath192 with @xmath210 and those events in @xmath192 with @xmath211 .",
    "* for @xmath212 , take the surface @xmath213 .    in words : as the @xmath206 clock proceeds on its worldline into the future of @xmath192 , it resumes running at the same rate as the @xmath187 clock , with an offset for the maximum shift in @xmath194 compared to @xmath187 ( the time interval @xmath214 over which the @xmath206 clock runs while @xmath187 is fixed ) introduced in the preceding steps .",
    "the flow resumes immediately for worldlines that reached @xmath192 first , and is phased in as @xmath206 advances .",
    "finally when all worldlines have running @xmath187-clocks , we simply follow the ( offset ) @xmath187 flow .     with respect to which all events in set @xmath2",

    "thin lines are surfaces of constant @xmath206 . ]    of course , for @xmath208 we could have simply used the original @xmath187 surfaces ; but the preceding construction is part of a more general method . if @xmath216 another step is required .",
    "one introduces an additional auxiliary spacelike surface @xmath215 , analogous to @xmath192 , but based on a large @xmath217 and @xmath188 instead of @xmath197 and @xmath189 .",
    "one then constructs a @xmath194 flow that first adapts to @xmath192 , as before , and then leaves @xmath192 and adapts to @xmath215 . in this second , intermediate phase ,",
    "a surface of constant @xmath206 consists of those events between @xmath192 and @xmath215 with @xmath210 , those events in @xmath192 with @xmath211 , and events in @xmath215 with @xmath218 .",
    "when @xmath219 , the @xmath206 surface coincides with @xmath215 , and the @xmath206 flow resumes until it rejoins ( with a constant shift ) the original @xmath187 flow .",
