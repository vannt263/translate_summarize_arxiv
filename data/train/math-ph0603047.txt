    "lattice bose - gas models were invented as an alternative way to understand continuous interacting boson systems including liquid helium , see @xcite and a very complete review @xcite .",
    "but recent experiments with cold bosons in traps of three - dimensional optical lattice potentials show that lattice models are also relevant for describing the experimentally observed mott _ insulator_-_superfluid _ ( or condensate ) phase transition @xcite . in @xcite and then in @xcite , this phenomenon was analyzed rigorously in the framework of the so - called _ bose - hubbard _ model .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study a _ disordered _ bose - hubbard model and in particular the influence of the _ single - site potential _",
    "randomness on the bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) .",
    "notice that the first attempts to understand this influence go back to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for continuous perfect bose - gases ( pbg ) in a random potential of _",
    "impurities_. for the rigorous solution of this problem see @xcite .",
    "one of the principal result of @xcite is that the randomness _ enhances _ the bec .",
    "for example , the one - dimensional pbg has no bec because of the high value of the one - particle density of states in the vicinity of the bottom of the spectrum above the ground state , making the integral for the critical particle density infinite .",
    "the presence of a non - negative homogeneous ergodic random potential modifies the one - particle density of states ( due to the _ lifshitz tail _ ) in such a way that the integral for the critical density becomes finite .",
    "hence , the one - dimensional pbg with random potential does manifest bec .",
    "the nature of this bec is close to what is known as the `` _ _ bose - glass _ _ '' since it may be localized by the random potential @xcite .",
    "this is of interest for experiments with liquid @xmath3 in random environments like aerogel and vycor glass , @xcite , @xcite .    on the other hand , the nature and behaviour of the _ lattice",
    "_ bec may be quite different .",
    "first of all , the lattice laplacian and the bose - hubbard interaction produce a coexistence of the bec ( _ superfluidity _ ) and the _ mott insulating phase _ as well as domains of _ incompressibility _ , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite . adding disorder makes the corresponding models much more complicated .",
    "the physical arguments @xcite , @xcite show that the randomness may _ suppress _ the bec ( superfluidity ) as well as the mott phase in favour of the localized _ bose - glass _ phase , but this is very sensitive to the choice of the random distribution .",
    "since there are very few rigorous results about the bec in disordered systems , we consider here a _",
    "single - site _ random version of the lattice _ infinite - range hopping _ ( irh ) bose - hubbard model , which in non - random case has recently been studied in detail for all temperatures and chemical potentials in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  2",
    ", we define the lattice laplacian for finite- and infinite - range hopping and recall the results about bec for the free lattice bose - gas .",
    "we then introduce random single - site and on - set particle interaction potentials and state our main result about the existence of and an explicit formula for the pressure for the irh bose - hubbard model with these type of randomness .",
    "we outline the proof of the main theorem using the approximating hamiltonian method .",
    "in section  3 we consider the pressure for extremal cases of _ hard - core _ and _ perfect _ bosons .",
    "we show that they are the limits of the irh bose - hubbard model pressure when the on - site particle interaction tends respectively to @xmath4 and to @xmath5 .    in section 4 ,",
    "we analyse the phase diagram in the case of a non - random on - site particle interaction and random single - site external potential .",
    "we distinguish a number of different cases .",
    "we start with _ perfect _ bosons and show that the randomness _ enhances _ bec in this case , see sect.4.1 .",
    "this is no longer true for interacting bosons .",
    "we study in sect.4.2 the phase diagram first for _ bernoulli _ single - site potential and then for _ trinomial _ and _ multinomial _ discrete distributions .    in the case of a bernoulli distribution and hard - core bosons ( infinite on - set repulsion )",
    "we showe that in addition to the complete bec _ suppression _ at extremal allowed densities @xmath6 and @xmath7 there is a new point @xmath8 , where @xmath9pr@xmath10 .",
    "we prove that for finite on - site repulsion the suppression of bec at _ integer _ , and also for _ fractional _ values of densities @xmath11 persists , if the bernoulli potential amplitude is large enough .",
    "in fact we find that increasing the bernoulli potential amplitude ( disorder ) decreases the critical bec temperature in the vicinity of fractional values of densities but increases it for integer values of density .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs also for _ equiprobable _ trinomial distributions , but now for densities @xmath12 .",
    "our numerical calculations demonstrate that it should be true for a general multinomial distribution .",
    "for illustration of a continuous distribution we study a homogenous distribution with compact support .",
    "then for hard - core bosons we prove that the complete bec suppression occurs _ only _ at extremal allowed densities @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with the trace of suppressions only at _ integer _ values of densities for a finite on - site repulsion .",
    "in particular we show that the critical bec temperature gets _ lower _",
    ", when one switches on disorder for ( a small ) on - site interaction , whereas it gets _ higher _ for perfect bosons . for large values of on - site",
    "interaction the picture is similar to the discrete distributions : increasing of disorder increases the critical bec temperature in the vicinity of integer values of density but increases it for the complimentary values of density .    in section 5",
    "we summarize and discuss our results .",

    "similarly , the next critical values are given by @xmath595    [ rho=1-p - bis ] in sect.4.2.1 we notice a new phenomenon specific for the random case : divergence of @xmath328 at @xmath384 for hard - core bosons , cf .",
    "figure 1 for @xmath596 . instead of fixing @xmath246 , fixing @xmath597",
    "it follows from ( [ rho=1-p ] ) that there is a critical value of the _ repulsion _ @xmath598 ( instead of @xmath391 as in ( [ eps - crit - corr ] ) ) so that @xmath599 diverges for @xmath600 in the presence of the random bernoulli potential : @xmath601 this critical value is not evident from figure 1 as @xmath602 .",
    "[ rem - beta - cr ] in sect.4.1 we remarked that the critical temperature for _ free _ bosons increases due to disorder .",
    "we also remarked that for the interacting case this is a more subtle matter , since it depends on the value of repulsion . for _ large _ repulsions close to e.g. @xmath603",
    ", we get by ( [ lambda - cr ] ) that @xmath604 this _ lowering _ of @xmath605 can be explained intuitively as follows . at density @xmath581 ,",
    "there is one particle per site .",
    "if @xmath589 there is a penalty for a particle to jump to an already occupied site , so the preferred state is where the particles are at fixed sites , which is almost an eigenstate of the number operators @xmath606 for each site .",
    "this prevents bose condensation .",
    "( this argument was presented also in @xcite . )",
    "however , if @xmath417 , then the lattice splits into two parts with energies 0 and @xmath391 , and a particle jumping from a site with energy @xmath391 to a site with energy 0 loses an energy @xmath391 , which counteracts the gain of @xmath246 .",
    "this creates more freedom of movement and therefore promotes bose condensation . on the other hand , for a fractional value of the @xmath311 in the neighbourhood of @xmath384 , the critical temperature decreases with increasing @xmath391 as can be seen from figure 1 .",
    "now consider the case @xmath607 . from equation ( [ newrhocrit ] )",
    "we see that at fixed @xmath608 , @xmath609 and for @xmath610 , @xmath611 as @xmath450 .    for the case @xmath612",
    ", we have to expand ( [ newrhocrit ] ) , as above for @xmath7 , see ( [ pho=1-eq ] ) , but to take into account that @xmath613 : @xmath614 this yields that @xmath615 for large @xmath446 , i.e. @xmath616 , if @xmath612 and @xmath450 .    for @xmath617 , one has @xmath618 . so that the @xmath341-terms in ( [ finbin ] ) are unchanged , but @xmath619 , if @xmath620 , which corresponds to our initial hypothesis about the value of repulsion : @xmath621 .",
    "hence , the @xmath622-terms are now dominated for large @xmath446 by @xmath560 and ( [ finbin ] ) read as @xmath623 in the limit @xmath450 we obtain from this relation the gap equation @xmath624 inserting @xmath625 into ( [ gap - rho>1 ] ) leads to @xmath626 solutions of ( [ eq - eps - cr-2 ] ) are : @xmath627 hence , there is a solution that for large @xmath246 has the form : @xmath628 or other way around , for a given @xmath391 we have : @xmath629 clearly , this critical value only applies if @xmath630 and @xmath631 .",

    "this phenomenon of course persists for @xmath656 and there are similar suppressions of bose condensation at @xmath657 etc . , if @xmath391 is large enough .      for @xmath656",
    "there is a similar enhancement of bose condensation at @xmath581 as for the bernoulli distribution , but the effect is stronger .",
    "this can be seen in figure 2 .",
    "the explanation is similar to that in remark [ rem - beta - cr ] , except now the lattice splits into 3 equal parts with energies 0 , @xmath658 and @xmath391 .",
    "particles can jump from a singly - occupied site with energy @xmath391 to a singly - occupied site with energy 0 or @xmath659 , thus compensating for the energy penalty of @xmath246 due to double occupation .",

    "the gap equation ( [ 3-mu ] ) then reduces to @xmath663 we can solve it for @xmath391 provided @xmath594 : @xmath664 thus , bose condensation is absent , if @xmath594 and @xmath665 .",

    "clearly , condensation is suppressed at @xmath672 and @xmath673 but not at corresponding fractional values above 1 , cf .",
    "figure 2 .",
    "[ fig3 ]        consider a random potential with _ homogeneous _ distribution between 0 and @xmath391 . in case",

    "we conclude by few remarks concerning our results and open problems . summarizing the most striking observations about the model considered in this paper",

    "nonuniform distributions as well as a random on - site interaction may also be of interest and give rise to new phenomena . of course , all our results concern the infinite - range - hopping model .",
