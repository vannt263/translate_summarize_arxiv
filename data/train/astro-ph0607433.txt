    "kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) in the x - ray flux of low - mass x - ray binaries have drawn much attention since their discovery , about ten years ago .",
    "the reason for this continued interest is that since they most likely reflect the motion of matter very close to the neutron star ( or black hole ) primary in these systems , these qpos may provide one of the few direct ways of measuring effects that are unique to the strong gravitational - field regime in these systems . in general two simultaneous khz qpos are seen in the power density spectra of low - mass x - ray binaries , the lower and the upper khz qpo according to how they appear sorted in frequency .",
    "most ( but not all ) of the work on qpos in these years ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) has focused on the frequencies of these qpos , because those frequencies provide insights into the dynamics of the system .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the observed relation between both khz qpo frequencies @xcite , their relation with the spin of the neutron star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as with other low - frequency variability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , both low - frequency qpos and broad - band variability .    from the beginning",
    "there has been interest on the other two properties of the khz qpos , their amplitude and coherence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; but systematic studies of those other qpo properties started to take off slightly later on @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out a systematic study of the khz qpo coherence and rms amplitude in three x - ray binaries , 4u 163653 , 4u 160852 , and 4u 173544 .",
    "they find that in all three sources the coherence and rms amplitude of the lower khz qpo increase slowly with frequency , and after they reach their maximum values they decrease abruptly as the qpo frequency keeps on increasing .",
    "( the sudden drop is most noticeable in the coherence of the lower khz qpo ; in the case of the rms amplitude the drop is less abrupt . )",
    "they propose that this behaviour is due to effects related to the innermost stable circular orbit , isco , around the neutron star in these systems .    triggered by these results , in this paper",
    "i investigate the dependence of the maximum coherence and rms amplitude of both khz qpos in a large sample of low - mass x - ray binaries . in ",
    "[ data ] i describe the data i use in the rest of the paper .",
    "since i collected most of the data from the literature , i spend some time describing how those data were obtained and the selection criteria . in ",
    "[ results ] i present the results , and i discuss them in  [ discussion ] .",
    "all the data that i use in this paper were obtained over the last 10 years with the proportional counting array , ( pca ; * ? ? ? * ) , on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "i collected most of these data from the literature .",
    "for this i searched , for as many sources as possible , all published values of the rms fractional amplitude and the coherence of the khz qpos .",
    "the coherence @xmath7 of a qpo is defined as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the frequency and the full - width at half - maximum of the qpo .",
    "some authors report @xmath10 and @xmath11 instead of @xmath7 ; in those cases i calculate @xmath7 using the previous formula .",
    "the rms amplitude , @xmath12 , is calculated from @xmath13 , the integral from @xmath14 to @xmath15 of the fourier power under the qpo , and the source intensity , @xmath16 , as @xmath17 @xcite ; from this definition , @xmath12 is expressed as a percent of the total intensity of the source .    from now on i will use the naming convention of the khz qpos introduced by @xcite , in which the lower khz qpo is called @xmath18 , and the upper khz qpo is called @xmath19 .",
    "the frequency , coherence and amplitude of each qpo carry a subscript or superscript @xmath20 or @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "a clarification is needed about what i call khz qpo in this paper . some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) identify low - frequency features as possibly being @xmath18 on the basis of an extension of the qpo frequency - frequency correlation , @xmath22 , to low frequencies ( below @xmath23 hz ) .",
    "it remains still uncertain whether these identifications are correct ( cf * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this paper i use the expression `` kilohertz qpo '' to refer to features in the power spectra of neutron star systems that have frequencies @xmath24 hz , and that have not been identified as hectohertz qpo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the goal is to compare the maximum values of @xmath7 and @xmath12 of each khz qpo in different sources , one of the requirements in collecting the data is that there are sufficient measurements of both parameters to have confidence that the maximum values have been measured .",
    "this is in part facilitated by the fact that we know the general dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath12 on qpo frequency for both qpos .",
    "for instance , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show that both @xmath25 and @xmath26 increase with @xmath27 , they peak at intermediate to high values of @xmath27 , and then they decrease as @xmath27 increases ( see e.g. , figure 3 in * ? ? ? * and figure 3 in @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath28 is more or less flat at low values of @xmath29 where it peaks , and then decreases as @xmath29 increases , while @xmath30 is more or less constant with @xmath29 , although it increases towards higher @xmath29 values ( see e.g. , figure 3 in * ? ? ? * and figure 10 in @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , here i compile data from papers that present systematic studies of the qpo properties , or that have enough measurements to deduce the systematic trends of those properties .",
    "i do not use result from papers reporting the discovery of khz qpos in a source , in which only one or two measurements of the qpo properties are available .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,^,^,>,^ , > \" , ]     notes  the @xmath31-@xmath32 errors are given .",

    "the first qpo measurements were obtained over continuous _",
    "rxte _ observations , usually stretches of up to @xmath35-s exposure time interrupted by the occultation of the source below the earth s horizon , or by the passage of the satellite by the south atlantic anomaly , when many instruments were switched off for safety reasons . because the qpo frequency typically changes by a few tens of hz within a thousand seconds @xcite , the qpos appear broader than they actually are in the average power spectra of those observations . since the width measured in the average power spectrum , @xmath36 , when a qpo of intrinsic width @xmath10 drifts by an amount @xmath37 is roughly @xmath38 , clearly intrinsically narrower peaks are more affected by the qpo frequency drift than intrinsically broader peaks .",
    "because in general @xmath18 is narrower than @xmath19 , the width of @xmath18 is the most affected . on the other hand ,",
    "since the total power in the qpo is conserved in the averaging process , the rms amplitudes of the qpos are less affected by the qpo frequency drift .",
    "( actually , the drift changes the shape of the qpo in the average power spectrum , and because the function used to fit them , usually a lorentzian , no longer represents them properly , also the rms amplitudes are affected , although to a lesser degree ) .",
    "2 .   when more data per source were collected , and it was realised that the qpo frequencies depended on other source parameters , it became clear that a much better way of studying the qpo properties was to average data taken at different epochs but having similar range of values of those other source parameters .",
    "the typical examples are data selection based on the colours of the source , or more specifically the position along the track traced out by the source in a colour - colour or colour - intensity diagram ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the frequency of one of the khz qpo , usually @xmath18 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but sometimes also @xmath19 @xcite , or the frequency of a low - frequency qpo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while these selections tend to reduce the spurious broadening of the qpos due to the qpo frequency drift , this effect may still be present in the results , especially when the parameter used in selection spans a large interval .    in this paper",
    "i try to use as much as possible data collected according to the second method just described , especially for the values of @xmath7 , and in particular for @xmath26 , which would be the quantity that is most affected by the averaging .    in a few cases one or more of the qpo parameters of a source",
    "are not available in the literature ; in some of those cases i myself have systematically analysed an published other qpo parameters ( e.g. , qpo frequency ) of those sources , and since i still have the data available , i analyse them myself for this paper to obtain those missing qpo parameters .",
    "i describe those cases individually , including a summary of the analysis procedures , below .    in tables",
    "[ table_l ] and [ table_u ] i provide all the measurements of the maximum coherence , @xmath1 , and maximum rms amplitude , @xmath0 , for each qpo for each source , including the frequency of the corresponding qpo at which @xmath1 and @xmath0 occur ; in those tables i also provide references to the papers from which these values were collected .      in most cases in the literature , the qpo properties reported are those measured over the full energy band of the pca ;",
    "nominally , this range is @xmath39 kev . in any case ,",
    "the pca instrument is not very sensitive above @xmath40 kev because of the lower effective area at those energies , and because the background dominates the signal . in a few cases ( see tables  [ table_l ] and [ table_u ] ) measurements were done over a different energy band to increase the sensitivity to khz qpos ; since the rms spectrum of the qpos increases steeply with energy ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in those other cases the authors analysed the high - energy part of the data , above @xmath41 kev . on the other hand ,",
    "the ageing of the pca units ( pcu ) , and changes applied to the gain voltage over the years to preserve the detectors affected the energy scale of the pca as well as its effective area as a function of energy .",
    "the largest impact occurred at the low - energy end , since the low - energy cut - off of the detectors is a strong function of the instrument s high - voltage ; from 1996 until present the lower energy boundary of the pca increased by @xmath42 due to the ageing of the instrument and the gain changes applied to it .",
    "because of the strong dependence of the rms spectrum of the qpos on energy , it is not straightforward to compare @xmath12 measurements over different energy bands : the higher the low - energy boundary of the band over which one measures @xmath12 , the higher the value of @xmath12 . on the other hand , @xmath7 measures the number of cycles of the oscillation which , at least to first order , does not depend on energy .",
    "therefore , one expects that the values of @xmath7 would not be much affected by the choice of the energy band over which they are measured .    to confirm the above , and to assess the effect of the change of the energy band on the parameters , i proceed as follows : i use the data for 4u 0614 + 09 from @xcite who measured @xmath7 and @xmath12 of both khz qpos over the full pca band ( @xmath39 kev , nominally ) , and @xcite who measured the same properties in the @xmath43 kev range . in both cases they report @xmath7 and @xmath12 as a function of qpo frequency , therefore i compare @xmath7 and @xmath12 in both papers at the same qpo frequency .",
    "i find that @xmath7 is consistent with being the same in both energy bands . on the other hand , the rms fractional amplitudes in the @xmath44 kev band",
    "are @xmath45 ( @xmath31-@xmath32 error ) times higher than the rms fractional amplitudes in the full pca band .",
    "however , the energy spectrum of 4u 0614 + 09 is rather hard , and it may be that in other sources that have softer spectra , the rms amplitudes in different energy bands behave differently . to check this , i compiled rms amplitudes in the @xmath46 band for 5 sources : 4u 160852 @xcite , 4u 172834 @xcite , 4u 163653 @xcite , 4u 0614 + 09 @xcite , and 4u 182030 @xcite , and the corresponding rms amplitudes in the @xmath33 kev range @xcite .",
    "i find that the rms fractional amplitude in both bands are very well correlated ( the correlation coefficient is 0.97 ) , and that the rms amplitude in the @xmath33 kev band in these sources is @xmath47 times larger than the rms amplitude in the @xmath46 kev .",
    "this number is slightly higher , but still consistent ( within @xmath48-@xmath32 ) with the value obtained above for 4u 0614 + 09 .    in summary , the above results show that : ( i ) one can compare directly @xmath7-values in different energy bands , at least as long as the bands are not too different from each other . because of this , in the rest of the paper i will compare @xmath7 values even if they come from different bands ; ( ii ) changes of the low - end of the energy band affect the rms amplitudes by @xmath49 of its value or less ( in the case of instrument gain changes and ageing , since changes of the low - energy boundary are smaller than those in the case of 4u 0614 + 09 previously discussed , the effect is probably much less important ) . in the next section ,",
    "when i plot the qpo parameters against luminosity and against each other , i divide the rms amplitudes in the band going from @xmath50 to @xmath51 kev by @xmath52 to make them compatible with the rms amplitude values obtained in the full pca band .",
    "the values quoted in tables  [ table_l ] and [ table_u ] , however , are the ones actually measured and presented in the original papers , in the energy band indicated there .",
    "once i have collected all @xmath1 and @xmath0 values for each qpo for each source , and the frequencies @xmath27 and @xmath53 at which those maximum values occur , i use figure 1 in @xcite to get the corresponding source luminosity : using the qpo frequency as input , i read off the luminosity of the source at that frequency from that figure . for three sources , 4u 160852 , 4u 163653 , and 4u 182030 ( see below ) , the maximum rms amplitudes of @xmath19 occur in states of the source in which the qpo frequencies are outside the range of frequencies in figure 1 of @xcite . in those three cases i either search the literature for flux measurements of the source in that state , or i extract spectra from the corresponding _ rxte _ observations , and calculate the luminosities myself , or both .",
    "below i explain those three cases in more detail .",
    "the luminosities that i report here are uncertain for a number of reasons : first , there is a statistical error in the fluxes derived from model fitting . given that these sources are quite bright when khz qpos are detected , and that _ rxte _ has a large effective area , these errors are small , usually less than @xmath54 .",
    "the second source of error is the accuracy with which one can determine the luminosity using the results of @xcite for a given qpo frequency .",
    "this is not so much how accurately one can read @xmath55 from their plot , but the fact that for each source there is not a single x - ray intensity or x - ray flux value that corresponds to a given qpo frequency .",
    "this is the so - called parallel - track phenomenon ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the extreme cases , the x - ray intensity of the source at a given qpo frequency may by as much as a factor of 3 different ( e.g. 4u 160852 , * ? ?",
    "* ) . on average , however , the range of intensities at fixed qpo frequency is smaller , of the order of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "the third source of error is the use of the @xmath57 kev flux as a measure of the bolometric flux of the source .",
    "this is discussed in detail by @xcite , and i therefore refer the reader to that paper .",
    "this effect contributes uncertainties of the order of @xmath58 of the reported luminosity values .",
    "the fourth source of error , if @xmath1 and @xmath0 depended not on the luminosity of the source , @xmath55 , but on the luminosity of the source normalized to its own eddington luminosity , @xmath59 , would be the use of a single eddington luminosity to normalise the observed luminosities of all the sources in the sample , as done by @xcite .",
    "of course , if @xmath1 and @xmath0 depended on @xmath55 , and not on @xmath59 , this would be of no concern .",
    "the value used by @xcite is @xmath60 , which is the eddington luminosity for a @xmath61 neutron star accreting matter with cosmic abundance .",
    "since all these systems are thought to have had a common evolutionary path , and to have accreted between @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xmath64 , the use of a single eddington luminosity introduces an uncertainty that is of the order of @xmath65 or less .",
    "( notice that changes of the chemical composition of the accreting material may introduce a difference of up to a factor of 1.7 in the value of the eddington luminosity ; in the unlikely case that the neutron stars in this sample had different equations of state , the different redshifts at the surface of the neutron star may add an extra factor 1.5 . ) finally , the largest uncertainty in the luminosity comes from the error in the estimate of the distance to these sources ( see * ? ? ? * for a discussion in the context of these sources ) ; this uncertainty can introduce errors of up to 60% in the luminosity ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it should be mentioned that for gx340 + 0 and gx 5 - 1 , @xcite only give upper limits to their distances , hence for those two sources the luminosities in @xcite should be taken as upper limits .    in tables",
    "[ table_l ] and [ table_u ] and in figure [ low ] i use a fixed error of @xmath65 in the values of @xmath59 as indicative of the error in the luminosity .",
    "it is clear from the previous discussion that this is a lower limit to the real error in this quantity .",
    "i now add a few remarks about special situations of some of the data for sources i include in this paper :    1 .",
    ": to measure @xmath4 , i use the same data in @xcite .",
    "i accumulate power density spectra every 64 seconds of data up to a nyquist frequency of 2048 hz ; i average a variable number of consecutive power spectra , in all cases less than 15 , in order to obtain significant qpo detections , and i search for high - frequency ( @xmath66 250 hz ) peaks . if i detect two qpo peaks , the one with the lowest frequency is @xmath18 ; if i only detect one peak , i decide whether it is @xmath18 or @xmath19 on the basis of the the rms - frequency relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if it is @xmath67 i discard it , if it is @xmath18 i measure @xmath26 . +",
    "individual @xmath26 measurements have relatively large errors .",
    "since @xmath26 is a function @xmath27 , i then sort the results on the basis of @xmath27 , and i calculate average @xmath26 values over a narrow range of @xmath27 . as usual , this procedure reduces the errors in @xmath26 at the expense of slightly underestimating its maximum value .",

    "this confirms that @xmath4 in 4u 0614 + 09 is in fact smaller than in the other sources at similar but slightly higher luminosity , and hence that the decrease of @xmath4 at low luminosity is real .",

    "furthermore , there is a significant trend in the relations between @xmath1 and @xmath0 within the atoll sources ; e.g. , the relation between @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( lower panel of figure  [ rmsq ] ) is @xmath129 different from a constant .",

    ". a particle in a circular orbit at that radius would be in unstable equilibrium ; if perturbed , the particle would fall onto the central object .",
    "no stable orbit around the central object is possible inside the radius of the isco , which in the schwarzschild case ( non - rotating central object ) is @xmath133 @xcite .    from the results of individual sources ( see references above ) and those of the sample of sources that i present in this paper , it is apparent that the behaviour of the coherence and rms amplitude of the khz qpos as a function of the _ qpo frequency _ in _ individual sources _ is similar to the behaviour of the maximum coherence and maximum rms amplitude of the khz qpos as a function of _ luminosity _ in the _ sample of sources_. since in individual sources there is a general relation between qpo frequencies and source intensity , in the sense that at higher intensity the qpos generally appear at higher frequencies ( but remember the parallel - track effect ) , this raises the question of whether the same mechanism may be behind both behaviours .    at first sight",
    ", this may appear problematic because it is known that the relation between qpo frequency and intensity in individual sources is more complex than the general frequency - luminosity trend described above , and detailed qpo frequency vs. intensity plots show the so - called parallel - track phenomenon ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , the link between these two behaviours need not be luminosity , but could be the high - energy emission ( or hardness ) in these systems .",
    "on one hand , in the sample of sources the maximum coherence and maximum rms amplitude of the khz qpo , except the maximum rms amplitude of @xmath19 , appear to correlate fairly well with spectral hardness ( see figure [ h1 ] ) , while on the other hand in individual sources the qpo frequencies are well correlated with the spectral hardness of the source @xcite , the index of the power law that fits the high - energy part of the x - ray spectrum @xcite , or @xmath16 , a parameter that measures the position along the track traced out by the source in a colour - colour or colour - intensity diagram ( called @xmath134 and @xmath135 in the z and atoll sources , respectively ; see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . from this",
    ", it follows that in individual sources there should be a relation between qpo rms amplitude and coherence on one hand and spectral hardness on the other . to my knowledge , a plot like that has never been published , but can be easily constructed using published results .",
    "for instance , in the case of 4u 160852 , this can be done by combining the plots of qpo frequency vs. hardness of figure 3 in @xcite and the plots of qpo coherence and qpo rms amplitude vs. qpo frequency of figure 2 in @xcite and figure 3 in @xcite , respectively . in figure [ 1608 ] i show the rms amplitude ( upper panel ) and coherence ( lower panel ) of the lower khz qpo ( left panel ) and the upper khz qpo ( right panel ) in 4u 160852 as a function of hardness . in this case",

    "* )    the trend seen in figure [ 1608 ] for the coherence of the lower khz qpo in 4u 160852 is rather similar to the behaviour of the maximum coherence of the lower khz qpo for the sample of sources in figure [ h1 ] ( left panel ; notice again that the hardness is defined over a different energy band in each figure ) : when 4u 160852 is hard , to the right of figure [ 1608 ] , the coherence is low , while for the hardest source in the sample , to the right of the left panel of figure [ h1 ] , the maximum coherence is also low .",
    "when 4u 160852 becomes softer , to the left of figure [ 1608 ] , the coherence first increases , and then drops abruptly ( see black points in figure [ 1608 ] , lower panel ) , while in the sample of sources the maximum coherence behaves in a similar way .",
    "the behaviour of the rms amplitude in 4u 160852 and the maximum rms amplitude in the sample of sources is more or less similar , except that in the case of 4u 160852 when the source is hard the rms amplitude is low , increases as the source gets softer and then drops abruptly ( see black points in figure [ 1608 ] , upper panel ) , whereas in the sample of sources moving from hard to soft sources the maximum rms amplitude remains more or less constant and at the end drops .",
    "to summarize , the relevant conclusion from this comparison is this : both the rms amplitude and coherence of the lower khz qpo in 4u 160852 and the maximum rms amplitude and maximum coherence of the lower khz qpo in the sample of sources drop abruptly when the hardness decreases .",
    "the comparison between individual sources and the sample of sources suggests that the same mechanism is responsible for the drop of coherence and rms amplitude of the lower khz qpo with qpo frequency in individual sources as well as for the drop of maximum qpo coherence and maximum qpo rms amplitude with luminosity in the sample of sources .",
    "the comparison between 4u 160852 and the sample of sources in the previous paragraph suggests that most likely the mechanism is related to the high - energy emission in these systems .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the fractional emission at high energies ( represented by the hardness or x - ray colors ) is the root mechanism that drives all qpo parameters ( qpo frequency , coherence , and rms amplitude ) .",
    "for instance , one possibility ( there could be many others ) is that the ( instantaneous ) mass accretion rate sets the size of the inner radius of the disc @xcite , which in turn determines the qpo frequency , as well as the relative contribution of the high - energy part of the spectrum to the total luminosity . if the efficiency of the modulation mechanism and the lifetime of the oscillations that produce the qpo depended upon the emission from the high - energy part of the source spectrum ( see   [ modulation ] for a discussion of possible ways in which this could happen ) , observationally it would appear as if the coherence and rms amplitude of the qpo depended upon the qpo frequency , and hence upon the radius in the disc at which the qpo is produced .",
    "the sudden drop of the coherence and rms amplitude of the qpo at some qpo frequency would then be associated to a dynamical peculiarity in the accretion disc , for instance the isco . observing the same source repeatedly would not allow to distinguish the above scenario from one in which qpo coherence and rms amplitude were actually set by qpo frequency or the dynamics in the accretion disc .    to distinguish between these two options",
    ", one would need to observe a sample of sources of khz qpos for which the mass - accretion rate , and hence the relative contribution of the high - energy part of the spectrum to the total emission , was different from source to source . in that case , qpo coherence and rms amplitude would drop for sources accreting mass at higher rates , even if the frequency of the qpo was more or less the same from source to source . since , as i have shown in this paper , this is the general behaviour observed in sources of khz qpos , it is reasonable to infer that a mechanism similar to the one i described in the previous paragraph is effective in setting the coherence and rms amplitude of the khz qpos .",
    "if this is correct , this also implies that the drop of qpo coherence and rms amplitude as a function of qpo frequency in individual sources can not be due to effects of the isco .",
    "note also that in individual sources not just the rms amplitude of the khz qpos , but also the rms amplitude of other lower - frequency qpos decrease with increasing qpo frequency .",
    "for instance , in four atoll sources , 4u 172834 , 4u 160852 , 4u 0614 + 09 , and 4u 163653 , the rms amplitudes of the `` bump '' , a qpo at @xmath138 hz , the `` hump '' , a qpo at @xmath139 , and the hectohertz qpo at @xmath140 hz , all drop as the frequencies of the khz qpos increase , in a similar fashion as the amplitude of the upper and lower khz qpos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ; see also there a description of these other qpos ) .",
    "this also argues against the interpretation of the isco as the cause of the drop of the rms of the khz qpos , and indicates that the amplitudes of _ all _ variability components are set by the same mechanism which , as i suggested , could be the same one that governs the high - energy spectral component .",
    "the idea that the rms amplitude and coherence of the qpos depend on the high - energy emission , and not on qpo frequency , can in principle be tested ; for instance , if one of the khz qpo sources showed a sudden change in the high - energy part of the spectrum , but the change of qpo frequency was less sudden .",
    "this could for example occur if the component that sets the high - energy emission in the spectrum of these sources and the one that sets the qpo frequency had different responses to changes of the mass accretion rate .",
    "this scenario is similar to the one proposed by @xcite to explain the parallel tracks in the frequency vs. intensity plots of these sources .",
    "if this was the case , one would observe a khz qpo that had a coherence and rms amplitude that would not match those expected on the basis of the @xmath141 and @xmath142 relations in , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "i would like to point out that figure 1 in @xcite appears to show an effect like this : individual measurements of the coherence of the lower khz qpo at the same qpo frequency differ significantly from one another .",
    "e.g. , in 4u 163653 at @xmath143 hz , @xmath92 ranges from @xmath144 to @xmath145 .",
    "this difference , however , may still be due to uncorrected drifts of the qpo frequency during the intervals in which @xcite measured the coherence of the qpo , although according to their description they had taken this into account in producing their figure .      how can the mechanism that produces the high - energy emission in these systems change the coherence and rms amplitude of the khz qpos ?",
    "there is general agreement that the oscillation mechanism that produces the quasi - periodic variability must be in the disk ( see the references to theoretical models in  [ intro ] ) ; it is very easy to come up with characteristic dynamical frequencies in the disk that match the observed frequencies of the khz qpos , whereas it appears more difficult to have a `` clock '' somewhere else in the accretion flow . nevertheless , from the early observations it became clear that emission from the disk alone can not explain the rms amplitudes of the khz qpos , since in some cases the modulated luminosity in the qpos is @xmath146 of the total emission , whereas at the same time the emission of the disk is @xmath147 or less .",
    "furthermore , the steep increase of the rms amplitude with energy imply a large modulation of the emitted flux , up to @xmath148 at @xmath149 kev ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , at energies where the contribution of the disk is negligible .",
    "hence , while the oscillation mechanism probably takes place in the disk , most likely the modulation mechanism is associated to the high - energy spectral component in these sources .",
    "the high - energy part of the x - ray spectrum of low - mass x - ray binaries can be described in terms of thermal comptonization @xcite . in low - luminosity atoll sources @xcite ,",
    "the hard spectral changes are explained as due to changes of the properties of this component as the average mass - accretion rate , @xmath150 , changes .",
    "for instance , for 4u 160852 , @xcite find that at low inferred @xmath150 , the comptonizing component has a relatively high temperature , @xmath151 kev , and is optically thin , @xmath152 .",
    "the high - energy part of the spectrum resembles a rather flat power law ( power - law index @xmath153 ) , with a high - energy cut - off above @xmath154 kev @xcite . at high inferred @xmath150 ,",
    "@xcite find that the comptonizing component becomes cooler , with @xmath155 kev and the optical depth increases , @xmath156 .",
    "the high - energy part of the spectrum resembles a power law that is steeper ( power - law index @xmath157 ) with a high - energy cut - off that is at lower energies than in the low @xmath150 case . in the case of high - luminosity",
    "z - sources @xcite , the comptonizing component is relatively cool and optically thick as in the case of the low - luminosity atoll sources at high @xmath150 @xcite .    using a simple time - dependent comptonization model ,",
    "@xcite calculated the spectrum of variability that would be produced by oscillations in the ( i ) injection rate of seed photons , ( ii ) density , and ( iii ) temperature of the comptonizing medium ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "they find that to reproduce the rms spectrum of the lower khz qpo in 4u 160852 , the variability must be mostly driven by an oscillation of the density of the comptonizing medium .",
    "they also find that in the case of variations of the density of the comptonizing medium , the largest rms variability in the @xmath158 kev range occurs as the optical depth of the medium is smallest ( see their figure 4 , panel b ) .",
    "if the high - energy emission is due to comptonization , the results of @xcite , together with the global correlation between luminosity and spectral hardness @xcite , provide a possible explanation , at least qualitative , of the dependence of the rms amplitude of the khz qpos on luminosity and hardness . at low luminosity ,",
    "corresponding to low mass accretion rate and hard spectra , the comptonizing plasma is optically thin , and hence the amplitude of the variability is high . when mass accretion rate increases , the luminosity increases and the source becomes softer , and since the optical depth of the comptonizing plasma increases , the amplitude of the variability decreases .",
    "this would explain both the drop in rms amplitude of the khz qpos at high qpo frequency in individual sources , and that of the maximum rms amplitude in the sample of sources at high luminosity ( low hardness ) .",
    "in individual sources , the rms amplitude of the khz qpos also decreases at low frequencies , which is more difficult to explain in this simplified scenario .",
    "also , in this scenario there is no straightforward explanation of the drop of the coherence of the lower khz qpo at high frequencies in individual sources , and at high luminosities in the sample of sources .",
    "@xcite have analyzed the rms energy spectra as a function of frequency of two low - mass x - ray binaries , the z source gx 340 + 0 and the atoll source 4u 160852 .",
    "they find that the variability , including that in the frequency range of the khz qpos , is primarily due to variations of the luminosity of the boundary layer , with the emission of the accretion disk being much less variable .",
    "they also find ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that in gx 340 + 0 , the contribution of the boundary layer to the observed emission decreases as mass accretion rate increases , as the source moves along the z - shaped track in the color - color diagram from the horizontal branch to the normal branch ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for an explanation of the branches in the color - color diagram of z sources ) .",
    "@xcite speculate that this decrease could be due either to obscuration of the boundary layer by a thickened accretion disk , a quantitative change in the structure of the boundary layer , or a complete disappearance of the boundary layer , when @xmath159 . in this scenario ,",
    "the decrease of the rms variability of the khz qpos at high luminosities ( high mass accretion rate ) would be related to the lower relative contribution of the boundary layer , which produces the bulk of the qpo variability , to the total emission .",
    "the obscuration mechanism can not explain , however , the decrease of the coherence of the qpo at high luminosity . one way to explain the loss of coherence would be if the modulation mechanism in the boundary layer would damp out the oscillations .",
    "for instance , the flow of mass onto the boundary layer could be modulated more or less periodically by the disc , and emission would proceed as a series of shots when mass reaches the boundary layer .",
    "changes in the configuration of the boundary layer , as those proposed by @xcite , could increase the damping and reduce the lifetime of the qpo .",
    "this is of course just speculation ; it remains to be seen whether it is possible to explain the decrease of qpo coherence by significant changes in the properties of the boundary layer .",
    "@xcite suggested that there is a critical luminosity for low - mass x - ray binaries with a neutron - star primary , @xmath160 erg s@xmath83 ; sources below that level show a hard power - law component , whereas sources above that that level do not .",
    "figure [ low ] shows a sort of dichotomy between the maximum rms amplitude and maximum coherence of the khz qpos in the z sources , for which @xmath161 and the atoll sources , for which @xmath162 .",
    "the separation , however , occurs at a luminosity that is @xmath163 times larger than suggested by @xcite . nevertheless , at least for the lower khz qpo , the maximum coherence and maximum rms amplitude change significantly and rather smoothly within the atoll class ; this may indicate that , if the qpo properties depend upon the emission of the power - law component , the relative importance of this component may change in a less abrupt manner than suggested by @xcite .    the @xmath164 correlation ( fig .",
    "[ cross - plots ] ) suggests that the same mechanism sets the amplitude of both qpos .",
    "but in each source @xmath2 and @xmath3 occur at different luminosities ( see tables [ table_l ] and [ table_u ] ) , and hence at different times , therefore the mechanism can not be acting simultaneously on both khz qpos .",
    "( in fact , in each source @xmath2 occurs at a higher frequency of the upper khz qpo , @xmath29 than @xmath165 ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if one ignores the case of 4u 0614 + 09 , the source with the lowest luminosity in the sample , also @xmath4 is correlated with @xmath2 as well as with @xmath3 . from this it is tempting to infer that the mechanism that sets the rms amplitude of the khz qpos sets the coherence of the lower khz qpo as well , at least for @xmath132 . at low luminosities",
    "either this mechanism is not effective in setting @xmath4 , or another mechanism comes into play that counteracts the effect .",
    "the lack of a correlation between @xmath6 and @xmath4 , @xmath2 , or @xmath3 indicates that the mechanism that sets the latter three quantities does not have a significant effect on the coherence of the upper khz qpo .    as i showed in  [ results ] , for 4u 0614 + 09 either @xmath121 is too low for @xmath2 , or @xmath2 is too high for @xmath4 .",
    "but since the maximum coherence for @xmath18 in 4u 0614 + 09 lies away from the @xmath166 as well as from the @xmath167 correlations , it appears more likely that in this case @xmath4 is too low both for the @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and not the other way around .",
    "this hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that a larger @xmath4 would bring 4u 0614 + 09 closer to the other atoll sources in figures [ rmsq ] and [ cross - plots ] , whereas lower @xmath2 and @xmath165 values would put 4u 0614 + 09 in the gap of the correlations in those two figures .",
    "if this is the case , it is unclear what mechanism could be responsible for the drop of coherence without a simultaneous drop of rms amplitude .",
    "comparison of the upper right panels of figures [ h1 ] and [ 1608 ] suggests that the behaviors of @xmath30 in individual sources ( in this case 4u 160852 ) and @xmath6 in the sample of sources as a function of hardness are also similar , in that both the coherence of the upper khz qpo in individual sources , and the maximum coherence of the upper khz qpo in the sample of sources are more or less independent of the hardness of the source .",
    "however , the lack of correlation between @xmath30 and qpo frequency in 4u 160852 appears to be exceptional , and in other sources , both atoll ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as z - sources ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath30 increases with qpo frequency , and hence decreases with hardness . from the data in figure [ h1 ]",
    "it is not possible to discard a similar slow decrease of @xmath6 vs. hardness .    in black - hole systems , high - frequency qpos",
    "have been observed in the range of tens up to @xmath168 hz with typical rms amplitude and coherence values @xmath169% and @xmath170 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the luminosities of these systems when high - frequency qpos are observed are @xmath171 erg s@xmath83 ( e.g. , in xte j1550564 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or , for the typical mass of the black holes , @xmath172 , @xmath173 .",
    "compared to the neutron - star systems in figure [ low ] , in black - hole systems the rms amplitude and coherence of the high - frequency qpos are too low for @xmath59 of the source , but they would be consistent with the values for the z sources at the same luminosity , i.e. , the luminosities not being normalized to the source own eddington luminosity ( of course , to plot the black - hole sources in figure [ low ] one would have to divide their luminosities by @xmath174 , the eddington luminosity for a @xmath175 neutron star , as was done for the other sources in that plot ) .",
    "it remains to be seen whether in black - hole systems the modulation mechanism of the high - frequency qpos would be similar to that of the khz qpos in neutron - star systems .",
    "i study the maximum amplitude , @xmath0 , and maximum coherence , @xmath1 , of the khz qpos as a function of luminosity and hardness for a dozen low - mass x - ray binaries .",

    "the maximum coherence of the upper khz qpo , @xmath6 , is independent of luminosity .",
    "3 .   the maximum rms amplitudes of both the lower and the upper khz qpos , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , decrease monotonically with luminosity 4 .   both @xmath3 and @xmath2",
    "increase with the source hardness ,",
    "@xmath4 first increases with hardness and then drops for the hardest source in the sample , and @xmath176 is independent of hardness . 5 .",

    "the similarity extends also to hardness in the sample of sources and in at least one individual source , 4u 160852 .",
    "the above argues against the interpretation that the drop of qpo coherence and qpo rms amplitude at high qpo frequency in individual sources is due to effects related to the innermost stable orbit around the neutron star in these systems .",
