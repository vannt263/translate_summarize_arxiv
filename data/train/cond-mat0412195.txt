    "recently much attention has been payed to bloch oscillations ( bo ) of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of cold atoms in the optical lattices @xcite .",
    "it was found that , unlike the case of a dilute atomic gas , where the atom - atom interactions can be neglected , bo of bec rapidly decay . a plausible explanation of this phenomenon is suggested by the dynamical instability of the gross - pitaevskii equation in the presence of periodic potential ( see papers @xcite and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we revisit this approach , assuming for simplicity the relatively deep optical lattices , where the gross - pitaevskii equation can be approximated by the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation ( dnlse ) .",
    "it is shown below that a strong static force can actually suppress the dynamical instability of the dnlse and , as a consequence , bos become not - decaying .",
    "we indicate a condition on the critical magnitude of the static force separating the decaying and not - decaying regimes of bo which , for a fixed static force , can be also formulated as a condition on the critical density of bec .",
    "this result is well supported by the numerical simulation of the system dynamics , performed for the realistic parameters of the present - days laboratory experiments with cold atoms .",
    "according to dnlse the ( mean field ) bloch dynamics of a bec is described by the system of coupled nonlinear equations @xmath0 in eq .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) can be written in the form , @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the quasimomentum ( @xmath16 ) , and @xmath17 bloch frequency .",

    "( [ 2 ] ) has trivial solution @xmath18 which is no other than the celebrated bo , where the kinetic and stark energies of the system oscillate according to the cosine law with the bloch period @xmath19 .",

    "it is easy to see that the matrix @xmath28 is parametrised by the product @xmath29 , the ratio @xmath30 , and the ratio @xmath31 .",
    "thus , without lost of generality , we can set two parameters ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 in what follows ) to unity .",

    "these numerical simulations , performed for different lattice size @xmath39 and periodic boundary conditions , undoubtly indicate existence of the critical @xmath5 . moreover , this is also valid for the non - uniform initial conditions @xmath40 , realized in the experiment .",
    "although in this case and for @xmath41 bo slowly decay ( with subsequent revivals , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] below ) , this decay is due to the trivial dephasing @xcite and fundamentally differs from the exponentially fast destruction of bo at @xmath42 , caused by the dynamical instability .",
    "one obtains a useful insight in physics of the discussed phenomenon by considering the limiting case of the lattice with only two sites , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the integral of the motion . using the substitution @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , one maps ( [ 6 ] ) to the periodically driven pendulum , @xmath48 with the angular momentum @xmath49 resticted to the interval @xmath50 @xcite .",

    "it is found that when the central stability island in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is large enough in comparison with the quantum of the phase space volume @xmath70 @xcite decoherence is negligible . on the contrary ,",
    "when the periodic point @xmath55 is hyperbolic , we observe rapid decoherence of the system ( see upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "note that the rate of decoherence can be well estimated by using the classical ( i.e. , mean field ) dynamics and considering an ensemble of initial conditions scattered around the periodic point .",
    "then the one - partical density matrix ( [ 10 ] ) is given by the correlation matrix , @xmath71 where the double - angle brackets denote the average over an ensemble of the initial conditions .",
    "the characteristic width of the distribution function for the action and angle variables is obviously given by the effective planck s constant or , equivalently , by the quantum fluctuations of the number of atoms in one well , @xmath72 , and phase fluctuations , @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath74 the classical dynamics of @xmath75 is depicted in the low panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . by comparing both panels",
    "one concludes that decoherence of the quantum system ( [ 8 ] ) is actually due to the chaotic dynamics of its classical counterpart ( [ 6 ] ) .",

    "although it looks problematic to extend the above phase - space analysis of sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] for @xmath79 , some conjectures are still possible .",
    "indeed , using the polar presentation for complex amplitudes @xmath80 , one maps the @xmath39-site system into a system of @xmath39 driven coupled pendula and there is no doubt that this system would be generally chaotic @xcite . on the other hand , absence of the dynamical instability for @xmath41 indicates the presence of the stable periodic trajectory in the multi - dimensional phase space of the system corresponding to the stable bo .",
    "the crucial point is , however , whether the stability island surrounding this periodic trajectory is large enough to support the quantum state . to answer this question",
    "we numerically solve the dnlse for randomly varied initial conditions , @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath83 is a random gaussian variable with @xmath84 , which accounts for the quantum fluctuations .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , which shows dynamics of the mean atomic momentum for @xmath36 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath58 ( upper panel ) and @xmath59 ( lower panel ) .",
    "it is seen that the stable regime of bo is also stable against the quantum fluctuations .",
    "this validates our conclusion about two qualitatively different regimes of bo .",
    "( a ) and @xmath87 ( b ) . [ average over 100 different realizations of the initial conditions ( [ 12 ] ) with @xmath85 . ]",
    "the width of the atomic array is @xmath88 , the nonlinear parameter @xmath76.,width=321 ]    it interesting to estimate critical values of the parameters for a typical laboratory experiment .",
    "taking as an example the recent experiment @xcite with @xmath89rb atoms in a vertically oriented quasi one - dimensional lattice of the depth 4 recoil energies , one has @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 recoil energies , respectively",
    ". then the condition on the critical magnitude of the static force is formulated as a condition on the critical density of the condensate and corresponds to @xmath93 atoms per lattice site . since the peak density in ref .",
    "@xcite is larger than @xmath94 , bos should decay , which agrees with the experimental finding .",
    "we have studied the dynamics induced by a static force of a bec of cold atoms in an optical lattice .",
    "depending on the static force magnitude @xmath5 ( or , equivalently , on the density of the condensate @xmath8 ) the system is shown to have two qualitatively different regimes of bo  exponential decay of oscillations for @xmath95 and ` quasiperiodic ' oscillations for @xmath96 .",
    "it is argued in the paper that the former regime reflects the chaotic dynamics of the system , where the transition to chaos coincides with onset of the dynamical instability in dnlse .",
    "it is worth of noting that the above results are obtained within the mean field approach .",
    "because this approach assumes the limit @xmath97 , @xmath98 , for any finite @xmath8 the classical ( macroscopic ) dynamics of the system , governed by dnlse , deviates from the quantum ( microscopic ) dynamics , governed by the bose - hubbard model .",
    "it is a challenge both for theory and experiment to establish the relation between the classical and quantum results , depending on the parameter @xmath99 .",
    "we would also like to stress that for considering the problem of quantum - to - classical correspondence one has to average the solution of dnlse over an appropriate ensemble of the initial conditions . without this additional procedure ,",
    "the solutions of the dnlse may have nothing to do with the solutions of the bose - hubbard model .    in this present paper",
    "we analyse the problem of quantum - to - classical correspondence for bo by using a two - site model .",
    "both the similarities and discrepancies were found . in particular , we show that the classically chaotic dynamics of the system for @xmath42 is responsible for decoherence of the system , which is the deep reason for the decay of bos . at the same time , the rate of decoherence , obtained by the means of the dnlse , appears to be correct only for the short - time dynamics .    to conclude , we briefly discuss the relation of the above results with those of our recent papers @xcite , devoted to the bloch dynamics of the system in the deep quantum regime @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "clearly , in this case one can not appeal to the results of the classical ( dnlse ) analysis and the system should be treated microscopically . remarkably , that this microscopical analysis also reveals two regimes of bo  regular ( not - decaying ) oscillations for a strong forcing @xcite and rapid decay ( decoherence ) of bo in the case of a weak static force @xcite .",
    "indeed , for @xmath41 the complex amplitudes evolve as @xmath103 .",
    "then , substituting here @xmath104 one obtains the characteristic dynamics of bo shown in fig .",
    "note that this regime was considered earlier by trombettoni and smerzi [ a.  trombettoni and a.  smerzi , phys .",
    "* 86 * , 2353 ( 2001 ) ] by using a variational ansatz .",
    "a similar hamiltonian appears when one stydies a bec of cold atoms in a driven double - well potential , see the recent paper @xcite and references therein .",
    "we also note that with a change @xmath105 the hamiltonian ( [ 7 ] ) corresponds to the so - called double resonance model , which was intensively studied during last four decades first in the connection to classical and then to quantum chaos [ see , for example , a review g.  p.  berman and a.  r.  kolovsky , sov .",

    "this regime is typically realised in 3d lattices .",
