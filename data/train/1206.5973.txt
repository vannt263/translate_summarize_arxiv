    "the problem of the stability of electron beams propagating through a plasma is important in the context of laboratory beam - plasma experiments @xcite , inertial fusion schemes @xcite , in the solar corona @xcite , astrophysical objects @xcite , etc .",
    "it has been suggested that pulsar glitches are due to a streaming instability @xcite , where super - fluid neutrons and superconducting protons co - exist with relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "it was early recognized that electron beams propagating through the plasma can give rise to high - frequency electron plasma waves , or low frequency ion acoustic waves .",
    "the ion motion becomes important if the electrons drift as a whole through the plasma and typically becomes unstable if the relative drift speed between the electrons and ions is larger than the ion acoustic speed , as in the original buneman instability @xcite in an unmagnetized plasma ( or electrons streaming along the magnetic field lines ) and the farley - buneman instability in magnetized plasmas @xcite .",
    "the physics of the linear buneman instability is fairly well understood @xcite in the non - quantum ( @xmath0 ) and non - relativistic ( @xmath1 ) cases ( @xmath2 is the reduced planck s constant and @xmath3 is the speed of light in vacuum ) . in other situations ,",
    "relatively thin beams of electrons penetrate a plasma consisting of both electrons and ions , giving rise to electron two - stream and ion buneman instabilities in different parameter regimes in the non - relativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite regimes .",
    "an electron beam propagating through a plasma can give rise to electrostatic two - stream instabilities when the wave vector and electric field are aligned , and electromagnetic instabilities obliquely to the beam direction . a typical condition for the ion motion to become important in a current - neutral plasma is @xmath4 , with @xmath5 being the electron beam gamma factor , @xmath6 the beam to plasma density ratio , @xmath7 the ion charge state , and @xmath8 the ion and electron masses @xcite . to incorporate quantum effects ,",
    "collective multi - stream schrdinger @xcite and klein - gordon @xcite models have been used to investigate the electron quantum two - stream instability for non - relativistic and relativistic cases . in the non - relativistic regime , the quantum two - stream instability can be physically understood in terms of a free energy available due to negative energy modes @xcite .",
    "in addition , low frequency linear and nonlinear waves in collisional , non - relativistic quantum plasmas can be derived using multi - stream , carrier - envelope methods @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider the quantum relativistic buneman instability , in which the bulk electrons stream against the ions , initially at rest .",
    "we compare the classical relativistic case with the non - relativistic and quantum case , as well as with the combined quantum relativistic case . as a model",
    ", we use a collective klein - gordon model @xcite for the electrons and a cold plasma model for the ions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the pertinent dielectric function and dispersion relation are deduced , starting from the basic hydrodynamic equations for the two - species plasma . in section iii , assuming low frequency and a beam - plasma resonance condition , the corresponding buneman instability is derived , in the case of negligible quantum effects .",
    "moreover , the instability is intuitively understood in terms of positive and negative energy modes .",
    "section iv and v extend the treatment to the quantum non - relativistic and quantum relativistic cases , respectively .",
    "section vi contains the final remarks and a discussion on the validity conditions of the model .",

    "when the doppler - shifted frequency of the beam mode is negative , its energy is also negative . moving through the plasma , the beam",

    "correspondingly , the predicted stabilization effects can be relevant for extremely short wavelengths .    as a by - product , the present treatment derived the doppler - shifted relativistic bohm - pines dispersion relations in eqs .",
    "( [ wp ] ) and ( [ wn ] ) .",
    "the relativistic effects inhibits dispersion , with a lower group velocity for a given wavelength , as can be verified .",
    "this prediction should be tested e.g. with the development of multi - peta - watt lasers @xcite .",
    "in summary , in this work it was developed an unified methodology for the treatment of low - frequency beam - driven instabilities in relativistic quantum plasmas .",
    "a detailed comparison was made considering different parameter regimes ( formally , @xmath0 and @xmath143 ; @xmath144 and @xmath1 ; both @xmath144 and @xmath143 ) .",
    "the corresponding buneman instabilities were shown to be associated to certain beam - plasma negative energy modes .",
    "both quantum and relativistic effects cause a stabilizing effect , with the remark that the quantum effects produce a splitting of the original buneman mode into two modes , due to the quantum recoil term as discussed in section iv . finally , observe that the model equations have certain limitations in particular because of the semiclassical nature ( no quantized fields ) , see @xcite for more details .",
    "nevertheless , the dispersion relation ( [ e2 ] ) can be equally found using more complete , field - theoretic methods @xcite . in this context , the positive - negative energy waves found here have a more broad applicability , as long as the low frequency assumption is valid .",
