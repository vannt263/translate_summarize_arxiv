    "one of the most popular approaches to constraining the mass density parameter @xmath0 , the ratio of the average matter density to the critical density , is based on comparisons between the galaxy density field mapped by redshift surveys and the galaxy peculiar velocity field inferred from distance - indicator surveys ( see the review by @xcite ) . while the numerous implementations of this approach differ in many details , they are all motivated by the linear theory formula for the peculiar velocity field , @xmath3 or its divergence @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass density contrast , @xmath6",
    ", @xmath7 is the hubble parameter , and @xmath8 is the present value of the expansion factor ( @xcite ) . and @xmath8 do not introduce any uncertainy in peculiar velocity predictions ; if one adopts km s@xmath9 distance units in place of mpc , then @xmath7 and @xmath8 do not appear in equation  ( [ eqn : vlin ] ) or  ( [ eqn : divv ] ) .",
    "] `` velocity - velocity '' comparisons start from the observed galaxy density field , predict peculiar velocities via equation  ( [ eqn : vlin ] ) or some non - linear generalization of it , and compare to estimated peculiar velocities ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1998 ; @xcite ) .",
    "`` density - density '' comparisons start from the observed radial peculiar velocity field , infer the 3-dimensional velocity field using the potent method of bertschinger & dekel ( 1989 ) , and compare the velocity divergence to the observed galaxy density field using equation  ( [ eqn : divv ] ) or a non - linear generalization of it ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . because the radial velocity field must be smoothed before computing the 3-dimensional velocity field via potent , density - density comparisons in practice always compare the smoothed galaxy density field to predictions derived from the smoothed peculiar velocity field .",
    "velocity - velocity comparisons , on the other hand , usually smooth the galaxy density field to suppress non - linear effects and shot noise , but compare the velocity predictions from these smoothed density fields directly to the estimated peculiar velocities of individual galaxies or groups . ( the spherical harmonic analysis of davis et al .",
    "1996 is an important exception in this regard . )",
    "the avoidance of smoothing the data is often seen as an advantage of the velocity - velocity approach , since smoothing a noisy estimated velocity field can introduce statistical biases that are difficult to remove .",
    "however , in this paper we show that comparing smoothed velocity predictions to unsmoothed velocity measurements generally leads to biased estimates of @xmath10 , even when the galaxy positions and velocities are known perfectly .",
    "the reason for this bias is fairly simple : the errors in the predicted velocities are correlated with the predicted velocities themselves , violating the conventional assumption that an individual galaxy s velocity can be modeled as a `` large scale '' contribution predicted from the smoothed density field plus an _ uncorrelated _ `` small scale '' contribution .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys map the galaxy density field @xmath11 rather than the mass density field @xmath12 , so inferences from velocity - velocity and density - density comparisons often assume a linear relation between galaxy and mass density contrasts , @xmath13 , and therefore constrain the quantity @xmath14 rather than @xmath10 itself .",
    "the results reported in this paper emerged from a more general investigation of the effects of complex galaxy formation models on estimates of @xmath15 ( @xcite ) . however , the statistical bias in @xmath10 that we find applies even when galaxies trace mass exactly , so here we focus on this simpler case .",
    "( throughout this paper we use the term `` bias '' to refer to systematic statistical errors rather than the relation between the distributions of galaxies and mass . )",
    "we further restrict our investigation to the case in which galaxy positions and velocities are known perfectly , ignoring the additional complications that arise in analyses of observational data .",
    "we have carried out n - body simulations of three different cosmological models , all based on inflation and cold dark matter ( cdm ) .",
    "the first is an @xmath16 , @xmath17 model ( @xmath18 ) , with a tilted power spectrum of density fluctuations designed to satisfy both cobe and cluster normalization constraints .",
    "the cluster constraint requires @xmath19 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath20 is the rms linear density fluctuation in spheres of radius @xmath21mpc .",
    "matching the cobe - dmr constraint and @xmath22 with @xmath17 requires an inflationary spectral index @xmath23 if one incorporates the standard inflationary prediction for gravitational wave contributions to the cobe anisotropies ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the other two models have @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with a power spectrum shape parameter @xmath26 ( in the parameterization of @xcite ) and cluster - normalized fluctuation amplitude @xmath27 .",
    "we ran four independent simulations for each of the three cosmological models , and the results we show below are averaged over these four simulations .",
    "all simulations were run with a particle - mesh ( pm ) n - body code written by c. park , which is described and tested by @xcite .",
    "each simulation uses a @xmath28 force mesh to follow the gravitational evolution of @xmath29 particles in a periodic cube @xmath30mpc on a side , starting at @xmath31 and advancing to @xmath32 in 46 steps of equal expansion factor @xmath33 .",
    "we form the mass density field by cloud - in - cell ( cic ) binning the evolved mass distribution onto a @xmath29 grid .",
    "we smooth this density field with a gaussian filter of radius @xmath34 and derive the linear - theory predicted velocity field using equation  ( [ eqn : vlin ] ) . finally , we linearly interpolate this velocity field to the galaxy positions to derive predicted galaxy peculiar velocities @xmath35 .",
    "figure 1 compares the true velocities of particles ( @xmath36 ) from one of the @xmath16 simulations to the velocities predicted ( @xmath35 ) by equation  ( [ eqn : vlin ] ) from the mass density field smoothed with gaussian filters of radius @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( panels a - d , respectively ) .",
    "the points in figure 1 show one cartesian component of the particles velocities .",
    "if we make the assumption , common to most velocity - velocity comparison schemes , that each galaxy s velocity consists of a large scale contribution predicted from the density field plus an uncorrelated small scale contribution , then the best - fit slope of the @xmath39 relation should yield the parameter @xmath10 , in this case @xmath40 , with the scatter about this line yielding the dispersion of the small scale contribution . however , it is clear from figure 1 that this slope increases systematically with increasing @xmath34 .",
    "( we note that the best - fit line , which minimizes @xmath41 , is shallower than the line one would naively draw through these data points by eye , since it is vertical scatter rather than perpendicular scatter that must be minimized . )",
    "the filled points in figure 2 show the estimated @xmath10 as a function of @xmath34 for the @xmath16 ( circles ) and @xmath24 ( squares ) cosmological models .",
    "the solid lines show the true value of @xmath10 . in both cases ,",
    "the estimated value of @xmath10 is quite sensitive to the smoothing scale : it is slightly underestimated at small scales , but increasingly overestimated at large scales .",
    "the @xmath42 model yields similar results , so we do not plot it separately .",
    "we also investigated @xmath16 simulations with a factor of two lower force resolution ( @xmath29 force mesh instead of @xmath28 ) and found identical results , so even at small smoothing scales our results are not affected by the simulations limited gravitational resolution .",
    "the breakdown of linear theory at small scales is not surprising ; however , the systematic failure of this method at large smoothing scales has not , to our knowledge , been previously discussed .",
    "the dependence of the estimated @xmath10 on the smoothing scale used for velocity predictions is our principal result .",
    "we can understand the origin of the large scale bias in @xmath10 by considering the case in which galaxy peculiar velocities are given exactly by linear theory .",
    "in this case , @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the fourier modes of the density field and the integral extends over all of @xmath45-space . predicted velocities , however , are estimated from the density field smoothed with a window function @xmath46 of characteristic scale @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the fourier transform of the window function .",

    ". however , if @xmath52 is positively correlated with @xmath35 , then the slope of the relation is no longer @xmath10 , since points preferentially scatter above the line for positive @xmath35 and below the line for negative @xmath35 .",
    "this steepening of the @xmath39 relation is just the behavior seen in figure 1 .",
    "equations  ( [ eqn : vpred ] ) and  ( [ eqn : dv ] ) show that @xmath52 and @xmath35 will be correlated as long as some fourier modes contribute to both integrals , which happens for any smoothing function other than a step function in @xmath45-space",
    ".    we can quantitatively understand this bias by considering how @xmath10 is measured . for an ensemble of @xmath53 points ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) , the slope of the best - fit line ( assuming @xmath56 ) is @xmath57 }                            { \\frac{1}{n } \\sum ( { { \\bf v}_{\\mathrm{pred},\\mathit{i}}}\\cdot { { \\bf v}_{\\mathrm{pred},\\mathit{i } } } ) }                 \\nonumber \\\\                 & = & f(\\omega)\\left[1 + \\frac{\\langle\\delta",

    "we can compute this effect in the linear regime for a given power spectrum of density fluctuations @xmath58 and window function @xmath48 . using equations  ( [ eqn : vpred ] ) and  ( [ eqn : dv ] ) we have @xmath59 p(k )",

    "the dashed lines in figure 2 show the slope computed ( from eqs .",
    "[ eqn : slope ] and [ eqn : dvvpred ] ) using the linear mass power spectra of the simulations and the same gaussian window functions that were used to measure @xmath10 ( solid points ) .",
    "the striking similarity on large smoothing scales between the n - body data and this linear theory calculation supports our conclusion that the large scale bias is indeed caused by the cross - correlation between @xmath52 and @xmath35 , which , in turn , is caused by the comparison of a smoothed prediction to unsmoothed data .    from equation  ( [ eqn : dvvpred ] ) it is evident",
    "that the linear theory cross - correlation between @xmath52 and @xmath35 will be equal to zero if there is no smoothing at all , or if the smoothing function is a step function in @xmath45-space , in which case the product @xmath60 $ ] is always equal to zero .",
    "the open symbols in figure 2 show results of a velocity - velocity analysis of the same simulations , with the linear theory velocities now predicted from a density field smoothed with a sharp , low - pass @xmath45-space filter . specifically , we set to zero all fourier modes with @xmath61 and plot the new estimates of @xmath10 at the values of @xmath34 for which a gaussian filter falls to half its peak value at @xmath62 ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) . using the sharp @xmath45-space filter causes the bias to vanish completely on large scales , yielding estimates of @xmath10 that are correct and independent of smoothing length .",
    "this result further supports our interpretation of the cause of the large scale velocity - velocity bias .",
    "figure 2 shows that @xmath10 is underestimated at small scales in the n - body simulations .",
    "the linear theory bias discussed above and shown by the dashed line in figure 2 is always positive .",
    "therefore , there must be a countervailing effect that biases @xmath10 estimates in the opposite direction on small scales . in highly non - linear regions of the density field , such as the cores of galaxy clusters , linear theory velocity predictions have large errors .",
    "however , errors caused by virial motions are uncorrelated with the predicted velocities because these virial motions have random directions .",
    "such errors add random scatter to the velocity - velocity relation , but they do not change its slope . in mildly non - linear regions of the density field ,",
    "on the other hand , galaxy velocities still follow coherent flows , but these flows may no longer be accurately predicted by linear theory . in the case of a galaxy falling towards a large over - density , linear theory will correctly predict the direction of motion , but it will overestimate the infall speed because it incorrectly assumes that the over - density has grown at the linear theory rate over the history of the universe , while in reality the over - density grows to large amplitude only at late times when it becomes non - linear . in such regions , @xmath52 will be opposite in sign to @xmath35 , causing an anti - correlation between the two quantities .",
    "the opposite happens in under - dense regions , but since fewer galaxies reside in these regions and the velocity errors are smaller in magnitude , the net effect is still an anti - correlation between @xmath52 and @xmath35 .    in order to show how these different effects come into play , we adopt a fluid dynamics description and divide an individual galaxy s velocity into a mean flow @xmath64 and a random `` thermal '' velocity @xmath65 , so that @xmath66 . here",
    "@xmath67 is the average velocity of galaxies at spatial position @xmath49 , and therefore @xmath68 0 by definition .",
    "let @xmath69 denote the velocity predicted in linear theory from the _ unsmoothed _ density field ( eq .",
    "[ eqn : vlin ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : dv ] ) applies to the case where the velocity field is exactly linear , @xmath70 , but more generally , @xmath71 and , therefore , @xmath72 this equation shows the three possible sources of error in the smoothed linear theory prediction of galaxy velocities .",
    "the first term represents the effect caused by comparing a smoothed quantity with an unsmoothed quantity in linear theory and is given by equation  ( [ eqn : dv ] ) .",
    "the second term represents the inadequacy of using a linear theory velocity estimator in regions where non - linear effects are important .",
    "the third term represents errors caused by galaxies random thermal motions .    as shown in equation  ( [ eqn : slope ] ) , the bias in @xmath10 depends on the cross - correlation of these errors with @xmath35 , @xmath73 the first term is positive and causes an overestimate of @xmath10 for nearly all smoothing functions .",
    "our calculation of this effect via equation  ( [ eqn : dvvpred ] ) shows that it is zero for no smoothing and increases monotonically with smoothing scale .",
    "we have argued above that the second term is generally negative and causes an underestimate of @xmath10 .",
    "since this effect arises from the non - linearity in the density field , it should dominate on small scales and vanish with increased smoothing of the density field . finally , the third term is equal to zero because the thermal velocities have random directions .",
    "a combination of the first two terms of equation  ( [ eqn : dvv3 ] ) explains the scale dependence of @xmath10 estimates in figure 2 . for large smoothing of the density field",
    ", the first term dominates and we overestimate @xmath10 , whereas for small smoothing the second term dominates and we underestimate @xmath10 .",
    "the estimate of @xmath10 is unbiased at the smoothing scale where these two effects cancel , but this scale should itself depend on the specifics of the underlying cosmological model . the numerical results in figure 2 confirm this prediction : the @xmath10 estimate is unbiased at @xmath74 in the @xmath24 model ( with @xmath75 ; squares ) and at @xmath76 in the @xmath16 model ( with @xmath22 ; circles ) .",
    "the smoothing scale for unbiased estimates could also depend on the assumed relation between galaxies and mass , a point we will investigate in future work .",
    "it is therefore , not possible to remove this bias simply by choosing the right smoothing scale in a model - independent way .    if we had adopted a higher - order perturbative expansion for predicting velocities from the smoothed density field , then equation  ( [ eqn : dvv3 ] ) would still hold with @xmath69 replaced by @xmath77 , the perturbative prediction in the absence of smoothing .",
    "the first term on the right hand side would still be positive , since some fourier modes would contribute to both ( @xmath78 ) and @xmath35 . the second term could be positive or negative depending on the approximation and the smoothing scale .",
    "however , while a higher - order approximation might reduce the magnitude of the second term relative to the linear approximation , it would not necessarily reduce the net bias in @xmath10 , since this depends on the relative magnitude and sign of the first two terms .",
    "the implications of our results for existing estimates of @xmath10 ( or , more generally , of @xmath15 ) are probably limited .",
    "as already mentioned , density - density comparisons via potent are not influenced by the effects discussed here , because they compare density and velocity divergence fields smoothed at the same scale .",
    "the analysis of davis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , a mode - by - mode comparison of density and velocity fields , is also not affected , since the two fields are again compared at the same effective `` smoothing '' . if the observed velocities are unsmoothed , a comparison in which velocities are predicted using a truncated spherical harmonic expansion of the density field ( e.g. , @xcite ) may behave rather like our sharp @xmath45-space filter analysis ( open symbols in figure 2 ) , since for a gaussian field the different spherical harmonic components are statistically uncorrelated ( a. nusser , private communication ; @xcite ) . among recent velocity - velocity studies ,",
    "our procedure here is closest to the velmod analyses of willick et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and willick & strauss ( 1998 ) , who used a @xmath79 gaussian filter to compute the predicted velocity field .",
    "these authors chose their smoothing scale partly on the basis of tests on n - body mock catalogs , and our results in figure  2 suggest that biases in @xmath10 should indeed be small for this smoothing .",
    "however , we have shown that the disappearance of the bias in @xmath10 at this smoothing scale occurs because of a cancellation between positive and negative biases , and that the scale at which this cancellation occurs depends at least to some degree on the underlying cosmological model . as improvements in observational data reduce the statistical uncertainties in peculiar velocity data , control of the systematic uncertainties that arise from comparing smoothed velocity predictions to unsmoothed data will become essential to obtaining robust estimates of the density parameter .",
