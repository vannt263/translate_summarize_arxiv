    "these include electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , the atomic frequency comb ( afc ) @xcite , four - wave mixing ( fwm ) @xcite , raman absorption @xcite , faraday interaction @xcite , controlled reversible inhomogenous broadening ( crib ) @xcite , and modified photon echo @xcite .",
    "the principle behind crib is to construct a reversible absorption process .",
    "after absorption in an inhomogenously broadened atomic medium , some mechanism can be used to invert the detunings of the individual absorbers that are spatially distributed in the medium . this reversal in detuning gives rise to a photon echo and thus the retrieval of stored optical information .",

    "it was then realized in 2008 that the application of a detuning gradient longitudinally along the length of the storage medium allowed for high recall efficiencies in the forward direction @xcite by preventing reabsorption of the light .",
    "this overcame a limit of 54% recall efficiency that had previously been determined  @xcite . the use of a longitudinal gradient to control the broadening of the atomic ensemble is referred to as longitudinal - crib or gradient echo memory ( gem ) . in 2010",

    "it has been demonstrated that in the linear weak - probe regime , this system does not show any excess noise beyond that required the preserve commutation relations @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the memory can only introduce vacuum noise associated with loss - just like a beamsplitter .",
    "this means we need not treat the noise terms with a full quantum model .",

    "the atomic spin decoherence rate is @xmath21 , one - photon and two - photon detunings are @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the excited state linewidth is @xmath20 . in the limit of large detuning",

    "we now simplify the equations further by performing an adiabatic elimination of the excited state @xcite and assuming @xmath28 , or equivalently @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the fastest time - scale of the evolutions .",
    "we also assume a large detuning compared to the spontaneous emission rate ( @xmath31 ) . assuming the coupling beam to be real and combining eqs .",
    "[ eq:3lmb ] we reach @xmath32 the term @xmath33 is the ac - stark frequency shift caused by the coupling field , which can be cancelled by adjusting the coupling field frequency . performing the transformation @xmath34 and @xmath35 we can remove the first term on the right hand side of the maxwell equation .",
    "we also perform the transformation @xmath36 , i.e. moving to a frame with speed of light , to reach @xmath37 the equations for two - level gem are @xcite @xmath38 which are formally equivalent to our raman scheme if we set @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , one can see that the gem storage mechanism described above for two - level atoms is also applicable to the three - level systems in certain regimes .",
    "the two levels are now the long - lived ground states of the three - level system .",
    "it is possible to associate a quasi - particle ( polariton ) with the light field and spin wave inside the gem system , similar to the eit dark - state polariton @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the polaritonic mode inside the gem system provides a clear intuitive picture of the system . neglecting the decoherence and taking the spatial fourier transform of eqs .",
    "[ eq:2latom1 ] and [ eq:2latom2 ] we arrive at @xmath42 and therefore @xmath43 here @xmath44 is the spatial frequency component of the joint system .",

    "using eq.[eq : keeqna ] , it is evident that the anti - symmetric mode will never be excited .",
    "the normal mode equation of motion ( eq .",
    "[ eq : motion ] ) indicates that @xmath49 propagates along the @xmath44-axis with a speed defined by the slope of the gradient . as the polariton reaches higher @xmath44 values the electric field amplitude decreases . as each frequency component of light propagates through the medium and",
    "gets absorbed by resonant atoms , the dispersion due to the neighboring atoms , having only slightly different resonant frequencies , will affect the propagation and absorption of the light .",
    "this is , in fact , the origin of the photonic component of the polariton and also the phase shift of the echo investigated in ref .",
    "the intensity of the atomic excitation , created after the input light enters the medium , remains unchanged during the storage time . flipping the gradient ( i.e. @xmath50 ) time reverses the absorption process so that when the polariton reaches @xmath51 ( the phase matching condition ) a photon echo emerges from the ensemble in the forward direction .",
    "we note here that at any time , the system is described by a normal mode with different amplitudes for optical and atomic fields , therefore it makes more sense to picture the gem storage as continuum of evolving polaritons rather than just a single polariton . in a three - level atomic ensemble , in the far - detuned and adiabatic regime , using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : three1 ] ) and ( [ eq : three2 ] ) a similar polaritonic mode can be described as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 .",
    "the second term in this equation necessarily goes to zero if the coupling field is switched off during storage .",

    "it can be seen that the light is nearly stopped at the centre of the ensemble after the pulse enters the medium and its intensity gradually decreases .",
    "the atomic spin wave is quickly generated after the pulse enters the memory .",
    "we also see that the spatial structure of the atomic and electric fields becomes increasingly fine as time progresses before gradient switching .",
    "the spatial cross section of the atomic polarization at any time during the storage is the fourier spectrum of the input pulse .",
    "this explicitly demonstrates the frequency - encoding nature of gem .",
    "conversely , any cross - section of the polariton @xmath62 along the @xmath44 axis shows the temporal profile of the pulse @xcite as a second fourier transform into @xmath44-space returns the original pulse shape .",

    ".  [ pol ] ( c ) where the polaritonic normal mode of the modulated pulse is plotted .",
    "it is quite interesting to compare the polariton pictures in eit and gem systems  @xcite .",
    "the eit polariton propagates through the medium ( in @xmath57 plane ) while the control field is on and becomes stationary when control field is switched off .",
    "thus , the temporal modes compressed within the atomic sample and , by integrating the polariton amplitude along the propagation axis , one can construct the temporal shape of the light field .",
    "the gem polariton , on the other hand evolves in the spatial frequency domain and its evolution can be controlled via the external field , as described above .",
    "the group velocity of the light field propagating inside the gem medium is given by @xmath63 .",
    "the further away the polariton is from @xmath51 , the less intense the electric field and the smaller the group velocity becomes . in the @xmath0-gem scheme , the group velocity and light amplitude can be controlled by both the coupling field and the gradient field .",
    "this extra control over the information provides considerable flexibility for data manipulation .",
    "the dynamic characteristics of the gem polariton allow one to precisely control and manipulate the state of the system in time .",
    "this control is even more versatile in @xmath0-gem due to the contribution of the coupling field and detuning gradient in determining the state of the system .",
    "the detuning gradient causes the different frequency components of the light to be absorbed spatially along the atomic memory .",
    "in the polaritonic picture , the phase matching condition is equivalent to @xmath51 .",
    "after the light is stored , @xmath64 can be switched to any arbitrary shape in time .",
    "the photon echo , however , is only emitted when the atoms are rephased and coupling field is on .",
    "the shape of the frequency detuning is chosen to be monotonic in order to avoid any re - absorption .",
    "one can use other forms of frequency detuning to avoid reabsorption , but a linear detuning is practically easier to implement and control .",
    "the shape of the detuning can be engineered in such a way as to optimize storage of a light pulse with a particular frequency spectrum .",
    "the size of the frequency gradient determines the bandwidth of the memory and , by applying a larger gradient field , the storage bandwidth increases . the number of well separated pulses , each with a bandwidth smaller than the memory bandwidth , that can be simultaneously stored is limited by the memory lifetime . for a simple linear gradient ,",
    "the efficiency of gem is inversely proportional to the size of the gradient .",
    "there will , therefore , be a trade - off between the bandwidth and storage efficiency . for efficient storage of broadband information ,",
    "large ods are imperative .",
    "the frequency gradient can be switched to higher or lower values or even to zero during the storage time without affecting the storage mechanism . in fig .",

    "the role of the classical coupling field in @xmath0-gem is to couple the weak probe light via a raman transition to the ground states .",
    "the coupling field is also required at the reading stage when the photon echo is emitted to transfer the information from the atomic spin back to the light field . in an ideal system",
    ", the dynamics of the coupling field during the storage time would not affect the storage process , but practically it is beneficial to turn off the coupling field during the storage time to reduce scattering and therefore loss .",
    "the scattering process is further discussed in the experiment section .",
    "the coupling field intensity determines the effective atom - light coupling and therefore the od .",
    "decreasing the coupling field intensity reduces the storage efficiency at the writing stage . at the reading stage",
    "this can result in partial retrieval ; the intensity of the coupling field when the normal mode reaches @xmath51 determines how much stored excitation is converted to the electric field and how much is left inside the memory .",

    "shape preserving storage in gem is possible if the absorption is time - reversed twice . the first pulse in",
    "would then be the first pulse out . using a three - level system ,",
    "one is free to turn off the coupling beam . in this case , although the atomic polarisation is completely rephased when the normal mode reaches @xmath51 , no light can be emitted because the atom - light coupling is turned to zero .",

    "fifo storage can also be achieved in a single memory operation based on two - level gem , albeit with some loss .",
    "this can be done by switching the gradient to a very steep value and opposite sign after storage as shown in fig .",
    "[ fiao ] ( c ) .",
    "this will effectively reduce the od of the system at the first reading stage and therefore most of the excitation will remain inside the memory @xcite .",
