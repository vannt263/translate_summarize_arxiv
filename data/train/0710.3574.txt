    "several years ago , sergey fomin and andrei zelevinsky introduced a new mathematical object known as a cluster algebra which is related to a host of other combinatorial and geometric topics . some of these include canonical bases of semisimple algebraic groups , generalized associahedra , quiver representations , tilting theory , and teichmller theory . in the proceeding we will use the definitions and conventions used in fomin and zelevinsky s inital papers , @xcite . starting with a subset @xmath4 of cluster algebra @xmath5 ,",
    "one applies binomial exchange relations to obtain additional generators of @xmath5 , called _",
    "cluster variables_. the ( possibly infinite ) set of cluster variables obtained this way generate @xmath5 as an algebra .",
    "it was proven in @xcite and @xcite that any cluster variable is a laurent polynomial in @xmath4 , i.e. of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a polynomial with integer coefficients ( not divisible by any monomial ) and the exponents @xmath8 are ( possibly negative ) integers .",
    "it is further conjectured that the polynomials @xmath7 have _ nonnegative _ integer coefficients for any cluster algebra .",
    "however , this conjecture has been proved in a limited number of cases , including the finite type case , as proved in @xcite , the case of rank two affine cluster algebras as demonstrated in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite as well as cluster algebras arising from acyclic quivers @xcite .",
    "the finite type case is defined as the case where the cluster variable generation procedure only yields a finite set of cluster variables associated to @xmath5 . by a combinatorial and geometric miracle , one which has sparked much interest in these algebras ,",
    "the cluster algebras of finite type exactly correspond to the lie algebras of finite type .",
    "furthermore , in these cases , the cluster variables ( except for the @xmath9 s ) have denominators with _ nonnegative _ exponents and can be put in a @xmath10-to-@xmath10 correspondence with the positive roots of the associated root system .",
    "study of the particular finite type cluster algebra of type @xmath0 , also known as the ptolemy algebra has been especially fruitful as it can be realized in terms of the grassmannian and plcker embedding . in 2003 , as part of the reach research group under jim propp s direction , gabriel carroll and gregory price @xcite described two combinatorial interpretations of the associated cluster variables , one in terms of paths and one in terms of perfect matchings .",
    "further , ralf schiffler recently independently discovered and extended the paths interpretation @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we go beyond @xmath0 , and describe a combinatorial interpretation for the cluster variables in all four families of finite type , namely @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , for the coefficient - free case .",
    "our combinatorial model will involve perfect matchings , in the spirit of @xcite , and agrees with carroll and price s interpretation in the @xmath0 case . unlike the aforementioned work we do not attempt to give the laurent expansion of cluster variables in terms of any seed but only in terms of the initial bipartite seed , whose definition we remind the reader of below . by restricting ourselves to expansions in this initial seed , we are able to explicitly write down families of graphs which encode the cluster algebra using weighted perfect matchings .",
    "we shall use the following notation throughout this paper .",
    "let @xmath11 be a finite graph with vertex set @xmath12 and edge set @xmath13 .",
    "for each edge @xmath14 , we set @xmath15 to be the weight of @xmath16 , where @xmath15 is allowed to be @xmath10 or @xmath9 for @xmath17 . a _ perfect matching",
    "_ @xmath18 of graph @xmath19 is a subset of @xmath20 such that for every vertex @xmath21 , there is exactly one edge @xmath22 containing @xmath23 .",
    "the weight of a perfect matching is defined to be the product @xmath24 , and we let @xmath25 denote the matching polynomial , or matching enumerator , of graph @xmath19 , defined as @xmath26 the result of this paper is the following theorem .    [ vargraph ] let @xmath27 be a root system of classical type and denote its positive roots as @xmath28 .",
    "for each such @xmath27 , we explicitly construct a family of graphs , @xmath29 , with the following three properties .",
    "1 .   @xmath30 .",
    "2 .   for each @xmath31",
    ", there exists a unique @xmath32 that can be effeciently identified .",
    "we have the cluster expansion formula @xmath33^{\\phi } = \\frac{p({g_\\alpha}^{\\phi})}{x_1^{\\alpha_1}\\cdots x_n^{\\alpha_n}},\\ ] ] where @xmath34^{\\phi}$ ] denotes the cluster variable corresponding to positive root @xmath35 ( in type @xmath27 ) under fomin and zelevinsky s bijection .    given graph @xmath36 , we are able to determine for which @xmath37 we have @xmath38 by breaking down @xmath19 into tiles . more precisely , we let a family of tiles @xmath39 be a finite set of graphs , with weighted edges , such that each @xmath40 is isomorphic to a cycle graph . given the faces and edge weighting of graph @xmath19 , we decompose @xmath19 into a union of such tiles by gluing together certain edges",
    ".      we shall use the convention from @xcite , so that the initial exchange matrix @xmath44 contains rows of like sign .",
    "any rank @xmath45 cluster algebra of finite type has such a seed consisting of a cluster of initial variables @xmath46 and a set of @xmath45 binomial exchange relations of the form @xmath47 after mutating in the @xmath48th direction , i.e. applying an exchange relation of the form @xmath49 binomial , we obtain a new seed with cluster @xmath50 and exchange matrix @xmath51 such that the @xmath52 s satisfy @xmath53 as we mention below in remark [ sameseed ] , we shall use an ordering of mutations in this paper so that we need only work with binomial exchanges of the form @xmath54monomial @xmath55 . note that we shall use the notation @xmath56 to denote the numerator of the cluster variable with denominator @xmath57 despite its similarity with the notation of @xmath25 for the matching polynomial of graph @xmath19 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we proceed to prove theorem [ vargraph ] separately for the four families of non - exceptional type , starting with the well - studied case of @xmath0 .",
    "we will use different language than in @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite , and we include our own proof of this case to familiarize the reader with the techniques which we will utilize later in the paper . since the type of the cluster algebra will frequently be clear from context , we will simply denote tiles as @xmath40 or graphs as @xmath58 ( instead of @xmath59 ) .",
    "we end with some comments and directions for further research .    in @xcite , fomin and zelevinsky",
    "explicitly constructed fibonacci polynomials for types @xmath0 and @xmath3 , which provide an alternate combinatorial expansion formula for cluster varibles .",
    "generalizations of these polynomials , for other types , are defined in @xcite , where they are referred to as f - polynomials .",
    "the work in this section was done independently of the work of carroll - price @xcite and the work of schiffler @xcite mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we will use the notation and the techniques of this section later in the paper for the @xmath1 and @xmath3 cases .",
    "thus we include this section even though the combinatorial interpretation given by proposition [ casean ] is not new in this case , although we believe our proof via excision , as described by lemma [ excisegr ] , is new .",
    "this excision technique will also be utilized for the @xmath1 and @xmath3 cases in section @xmath43 .",
    "we begin by reviewing the necessary characteristics of the cluster algebra of type @xmath0 .",
    "recall that lie algebra @xmath0 has a dynkin diagram consisting of a line of @xmath45 vertices connected by edges of weight one .",
    "@xmath60    thus the associated cartan matrix has the form    @xmath61    and thus using the convention given in @xcite the associated exchange matrix is    @xmath62    notice that every row has like sign and that the matrix is skew - symmetrizable ( and in fact skew - symmetric in this case ) .",
    "the bipartite seed for a cluster algebra of type @xmath0 therefore consists of a initial cluster of variables @xmath63 and exchange matrix @xmath64 which encodes the following exchange binomials    @xmath65    we describe a set of tiles from which we will build our family of graphs . in the case of @xmath0 , let tiles @xmath66 be squares defined as follows :    tile @xmath67 s northern edge is given weight @xmath68 while the other three are given weight @xmath10 .",
    "tile @xmath69 s southern edge is weighted with value @xmath70 and the rest are weighted with value @xmath10 .",
    "finally all other @xmath40 have a weight of @xmath71 given to their northern edge , @xmath72 for their southern edge while the eastern and western edges are given weight @xmath10 .",
    "+ the tiles for cluster algebra of type @xmath73 .",
    "let @xmath74 be the set of graphs that can be built from these @xmath45 tiles given the following gluing rule .",
    "[ gluing ] without allowing reflections or rotations of the tiles , tile @xmath40 can be glued to tile @xmath75 if and only if the identified edge ( as an edge of @xmath40 ) lies clockwise from an edge weighted @xmath76 and clockwise from an edge weighted @xmath9 ( as an edge of @xmath75 ) .",
    "since tile @xmath40 only contains edges of weight @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and these weights appear across from each other , this rule uniquely describes how the blocks can connect .    given the above tiles , @xmath77 , and the above gluing rule , the collection of possible graphs is enumerated by the set of subsets @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "this collection @xmath74 has the same cardinality as the set of positive roots of the lie algebra of type @xmath0 using the bijection @xmath80 as shown in @xcite , this implies that the cardinality is also the same as the number of non - initial cluster variables for the bipartite cluster algebra of type @xmath0 .",
    "[ casean ] the set of graphs @xmath74 is in bijection with the set of non - initial cluster variables for a coefficient - free cluster algebra of type @xmath0 and satisfy the statement of theorem [ vargraph ] .",
    "+ the collection @xmath81 .    to prove this proposition",
    "we will take a detour through a case we refer to as @xmath82 . in this case ,",
    "our set of tiles is in bijection with the integers , and we define @xmath40 to have @xmath71 on its northern edge , @xmath72 on its southern edge for all @xmath83 . without the issue of boundaries ,",
    "it is easier to show that a certain lattice of graphs corresponds to the non - initial cluster variables .",
    "after doing so , we choose a periodic specialization for the initial variables to recover a corresponding region of this lattice for any specific @xmath0 .",
    "we start with the following observation .",
    "[ sameseed]for all @xmath45 , if we start with the above exchange matrix @xmath64 and apply the binomial exchanges corresponding to relations @xmath10 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( resp .",

    "@xmath45 ) if @xmath45 is odd ( resp . even ) to exchange matrix @xmath90 results in the intial exchange matrix @xmath64 . in fact , in both of these cases , the order of the exchanges does not matter , and the intermediate exchange matrices will have rows of like sign for all relevant @xmath91 not already exchanged . by the definition of matrix mutation , this procedure will in fact work for any cluster algebra where the seed has an exchange matrix that is tri - diagonal ( @xmath92 if @xmath93 ) .",
    "thus we can calculate a row of cluster variables at a time by applying the exchange relations relative to the two previous rows .",
    "the tri - diagonal condition includes the cases @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath94 and minor modifications to the procedure will allow it to work for @xmath3 .",
    "returning to the @xmath0 case , after applying exchange @xmath95 ( resp .",
    "@xmath86 ) we have cluster    @xmath96 @xmath97    where @xmath98 using the convention @xmath99 .",
    "analogously , applying exchanges @xmath100 ( resp .",
    "@xmath45 ) we obtain the cluster    @xmath101 @xmath102    where @xmath103 for @xmath104 , if we set @xmath105 . by remark [ sameseed ]",
    "we can make a lattice of cluster variables by applying exchanges iteratively ( row - by - row ) in this order .",
    "@xmath106 +    top six rows of this lattice ( assuming @xmath45 odd ) .    by the binomial exchange relations , this lattice satisfies the diamond condition which states that the relation @xmath107 holds for any four elements arranged as a diamond .",
    "@xmath108    for example @xmath109 for @xmath110 .",
    "furthermore , this lattice can be extended periodically by using the conventions @xmath105 , @xmath111 , and extending further using negatively weighted variables .",
    "note that the negatives are necessary since we wish the configurations    @xmath112    to satisfy the diamond condtion .",

    "this lattice can also continue infinitely in the vertical direction , as well as horizontally , extending vertically in the unique way that preserves the diamond condition throughout the entire lattice .",
    "consequently all @xmath0 can be treated simultaneously by considering the infinite diamond pattern ( @xmath82 ) which starts with sequence @xmath114 zig - zagging to create the initial two rows . to obtain the extended @xmath0-lattice for a specific @xmath45",
    "we let @xmath115 and then take the limit as @xmath116 goes to zero .",
    "we do not set @xmath116 and @xmath117 to be zero directly since this would sometimes result in indeterminate expressions of the form `` @xmath118 '' .",
    "also we use the shifted indices here since it will make the ensuing arguments more symmetrical .    as a consequence of these substitutions , it suffices to start the proof of proposition [ casean ] by proving the combinatorial interpretation for the infinite diamond pattern corresponding to @xmath82 , which we write in terms of @xmath119 s for @xmath120 .",
    "even though we now have a boundary - less lattice , every given @xmath121 can be computed locally by considering the necessary mutations stemming from a finite half diamond extending back to the initial two rows of @xmath119 s .     + the tiles for the extended @xmath0-lattice .    for the purposes of the @xmath122 case , for all @xmath123 , we let @xmath124 denote the tile with @xmath125 on its northern edge and @xmath126 on its southern edge",
    ". we will utilize variables @xmath119 s and tiles @xmath124 s until we do the final substitution at the end of the proof of proposition [ casean ] .",
    "we now proceed to prove the combinatorial interpretation in this boundary - less version .",
    "we start with the base case where we can easily see that the combinatorial interpretation works for cluster variables with denominator @xmath119 . to see this",
    ", we observe that @xmath127 corresponds to the two perfect matchings of the graph consisting of tile @xmath128 by itself .",
    "similarly , we observe the bijection works for the second row of non - initial cluster variables by the definition of @xmath129 .",
    "we see this by verifying that the graph containing tiles @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 connected in that order bijects to cluster variable @xmath129 , i.e. @xmath133 . by a technique of graphical condensation developed by eric kuo @xcite , we obtain the following combinatorial interpretation for the rest of the rows .",
    "[ diag ] cluster variable @xmath121 bijects to graph @xmath134 i.e. the grid graph containing exactly @xmath135 tiles , namely tiles @xmath136 through @xmath137 connected in order .",

    ". it thus suffices to show , for all @xmath123 , that laurent polynomials @xmath121 , defined as @xmath148 , equal @xmath149 where @xmath150 we use our induction hypothesis and normalize to rewrite our desired equation as @xmath151    one can decompose graph @xmath152 into a superposition of graphs @xmath153 so that @xmath154 is the intersection of overlap . out of the two subgraphs , only @xmath155 contains tiles @xmath156 and only @xmath157 contains @xmath158 .",

    "@xmath182 ) .",
    "map @xmath176 is injective since the inverse map just swaps back the right - hand sides as dictated by the alternating pattern of horizontals .",

    "lastly , it is easy to verify that @xmath186 is the unique matching which can not be decomposed into a pair @xmath185 .",
    "analogous pairings will also appear below in the arguments for the case of @xmath1 .",

    "we use collection @xmath472 with tile @xmath67 as in the @xmath1 case , and tile @xmath309 is again a hexagon , but now has all three nontrivial weights being value @xmath325 .",
    "there are six possible graphs that correspond to the non - initial cluster variables .",
    "@xmath94 has dynkin diagram and exchange matrix @xmath474",
    "given the previous sections , coefficient - free cluster algebras of type @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , or @xmath94 have a combinatorial interpretation as a family of graphs such that the numerators of the cluster variables enumerate the weighted number of matchings and the denominators encode the occurrences of faces .",
    "thus theorem [ vargraph ] is true in all of these cases .",
    "the next step would be to extend theorem [ vargraph ] to include cluster algebras of type @xmath475 , @xmath476 , @xmath477 , and @xmath478 , and thus have the result for all cluster algebras of finite type .",
    "even though the dynkin diagrams for the @xmath479 s are simply laced , fitting cluster algebras of these three types into patterns analogous to those of the @xmath0 s and @xmath3 s has been notoriously hard .",
    "such difficulties have rose elsewhere such as in the original proof of positivity in @xcite , and also in recent models using @xmath480-paths on triangulated surfaces , for example in @xcite or @xcite among other work .",
    "additionally , in the work of schiffler and carroll - price for @xmath0 , the cluster algebra considered is specifically the ptolemy algebra , a cluster algebra _ with _ coefficients . in the @xmath480-paths model ,",
    "the boundary of the polygon gives rise to @xmath481 additional coefficients which can be included in the exchange relations and cluster expansion formula .",
    "since the graphs we obtain in the above combinatorial interpretations are weighted so sparsely , perhaps a certain number of coefficients can be handled by the graph - model as well .    in @xcite",
    ", an analogous interpretation is given for rank @xmath88 cluster algebras of affine type and unpublished work @xcite done as a part of reach , as described in @xcite , gives a graph theoretic interpretation for a totally cyclic rank @xmath84 cluster algebra .",
    "this totally cyclic rank @xmath84 cluster algebra corresponds to a triangulated surface of genus one with exactly one puncture ( i.e. interior marked point ) .",
    "such a cluster algebra has been studied geometrically including work of @xcite .",
    "perhaps these graph theoretical interpretations could be extended to other cluster algebras thus providing proofs of fomin and zelevinsky s positivity conjecture for even further cases .",
    "lastly , we note that all the examples discussed above are families of _ planar _ graphs associated to generators of cluster algebras",
    ". when expanding our scope to include more complicated cluster algebras , is the category of planar graphs too restrictive ? more specifically , why did we need the extra arcs in the @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath94 , and affine @xmath482 cases ? perhaps it is an artifice of taking a higher dimensional object and projecting to two dimensions .",
    "the author would like to thank andrei zelevinsky for numerous helpful conversations including referring the author to @xcite where fibonacci polynomials appear .",
    "discussions with sergey fomin , jim propp , ralf schiffler , and hugh thomas have also been very useful .",
