    "electrolyte solutions are of fundamental interest for a variety of disciplines .",
    "over a hundred years ago hofmeister observed a strong dependence of the stability of protein solutions on the specific nature of electrolyte .",
    "while some ions tend to stabilize protein solutions , often denaturing them in the process , others destabilize them favoring protein precipitation .",
    "a few years after hofmeister , heydweiller  @xcite observed that salt increases the surface tension of the air - water interface .",
    "furthermore , heydweiller noticed that the relative effect that ions have on the surface tension follows closely the hofmeister series , suggesting that the two phenomena are related .    over the last hundred years",
    "there has been a great effort to understand how ionic specificity influences stability of protein solutions and how it affects the surface tension of the air - water interface .",
    "langmuir  @xcite was probably the first to attempt to construct a quantitative theory of surface tensions of electrolyte solutions . appealing to the gibbs adsorption isotherm",
    ", langmuir concluded that the excess surface tension of electrolyte solution was a consequence of ionic depletion from the interfacial region .",
    "however , no clear explanation for this depletion was provided .",
    "a few years after , wagner  @xcite argued that this depletion was the result of interaction between the ions and their electrostatic images across the air - water interface .",
    "onsager and samaras  @xcite simplified wagner s theory and obtained a limiting law which they argued was universally valid for all electrolytes at sufficiently small concentration .",
    "more recently , levin and flores - mena  @xcite used a direct free energy calculation to obtain surface tension of strong electrolytes . to have a quantitative agreement with experiments",
    ", these authors stressed the fundamental importance of ionic hydration .",
    "nevertheless , the theory of levin and flores - mena was not able to predict correctly surface tensions of all electrolyte solutions .",
    "bostrm et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that hofmeister effect and the ionic specificity are a consequence of dispersion forces arising from finite frequency electromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "this theory predicted that weakly polarizable cations should be adsorbed at the air - water interface .",
    "this , however , was contradicted by the experimental measurements of the electrostatic potential difference  @xcite and by the simulations on small water clusters  @xcite , as well as by the subsequent large scale polarizable force fields simulations  @xcite and the photoelectron emission experiments  @xcite .",
    "these experiments and simulations showed that some anions  and not cations  are present at the solution - air interface  @xcite . to explain this , levin  @xcite extended the traditional born theory of ionic solvation to account for ionic polarizability .",
    "the new theory predicted that highly polarizable anions can actually prefer an interfacial solvation . in a followup work ,",
    "levin et al .",
    "@xcite used this theory to quantitatively calculate the surface tensions and the surface potentials of 10 different electrolyte solutions and to reproduce the lyotropic , hofmeister , series .    while almost all salts lead to increase the air - water surface tension , acids tend to lower it  @xcite .",
    "the only explanation for this is a strong proton adsorption at the water - air interface  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that ion forms various complexes with water molecules  @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the high surface adsorption of is related to the hydronium ( ) geometry  @xcite .",
    "this ion , has a trigonal pyramidal structure with the hydrogens located at the base of the pyramid @xcite . in this form",
    "hydrogens are good hydrogen - bond donors , while oxygen is a bad hydrogen - bond receptor @xcite .",
    "this favors hydronium ion to be preferentially located at the interface , with the hydrogens pointing towards the bulk water and the oxygen pointing into the gas phase @xcite .",
    "explicit solvation energy calculations confirm this picture @xcite .",
    "the sign of electrostatic surface potential difference is related with the relative population of cations and anions at the interface .",
    "because of high adsorption of hydronium ions , one would naturally expect that the electrostatic potential difference across the air - water interface for acid solutions should be positive .",
    "the experiments , however , show that the surface potential difference for acids has the same sign as for halide salts , i.e. is predominantly negative @xcite .",
    "frumkin @xcite suggested that this apparently strange behavior might be a consequence of the incomplete dissociation of acid molecules .",
    "a different explanation was advanced by randles @xcite who argued that presence of hydroniums at the interface leads to a preferential orientation of water molecules resulting in a dipole layer with a negative electrostatic potential difference across it .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with the theory proposed in the present paper , as well as with the recent molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present a theory that allows us to quantitatively calculate surface tensions of acid solutions using only one adjustable parameter related to the strength of the hydronium adsorption to the interface .",
    "predictions of the theory are compared with the experimental measurements .",
    "the theory is then used to estimate the electrostatic potential difference across the water - air interface for various acid solutions .",
    "we consider an acid solution in a form of a drop of radius @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the position of the gibbs dividing surface ( gds ) @xcite .",
    "the water and air will be modeled as uniform dielectrics of permittivities @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the surface tension can be obtained by integrating the gibbs adsorption isotherm equation : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the chemical potentials and @xmath6 are the de broglie thermal wavelengths . in this equation",
    "@xmath7 sign corresponds to the hydronium ion , and @xmath8 sign to the anion .",

    "the ionic density profiles , @xmath10 , will be calculated using a modified poisson - boltzmann ( mpb ) equation , as discussed later in the paper .",
    "anions are divided into two categories : kosmotropes and chaotropes .",
    "the theory of electrolyte solutions @xcite showed that chaotropes , br@xmath13 , i@xmath13 , no@xmath14 , and clo@xmath15 , lose their hydration sheath near the gds and are partially adsorbed to the interface . on the other hand kosmotropes , f@xmath13 , cl@xmath13 , and",
    "so@xmath16 remain hydrated in the interfacial region and are repelled from the gds .",

    "the force that drives chaotropic ions towards the interface results from water cavitation . to introduce an ion into an aqueous environment requires creating a cavity , which perturbes the hydrogen bond network of water molecules . for small ions ,",
    "the free energy cost of forming a cavity is entropic and is proportional to the volume of the void formed @xcite . as the ion moves across the gds , its cavitational free energy decreases .",
    "this results in a short - range attractive potential between the anion and the gds @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 @xmath33 is obtained from bulk simulations @xcite . for hard ( weakly polarizable ions )",
    "the cavitational free energy gain is completely overwhelmed by the electrostatic free energy penalty of moving ionic charge into the low dielectric environment .",
    "for soft polarizable ions , however , the electrostatic penalty is small , since most of the ionic charge remain inside the aqueous environment .",
    "the total potential of a soft anion , therefore , has a minimum in the vicinity of the gds , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "the h@xmath34 ions ( protons ) do not exist as a separate specie in water .",
    "instead they form complexes with water molecules , h@xmath35o@xmath34 and h@xmath36o@xmath37 @xcite . because of its favorable geometry ( trigonal pyramidal ) , the hydronium ion ( h@xmath35o@xmath34 ) adsorbs to the water - air interface with a preferential orientation @xcite of oxygen towards the air .",
    "we model this attraction by a square well potential with a range of a hydrogen bond @xmath38  , @xmath39 the depth of the potential is then adjusted to obtain the experimentally measured surface tension of hcl . the same potential is then used to calculate the surface tensions of all other acids .",
    "we should stress , however , that one should not attach too much meaning to the specific value of the potential depth .",
    "the real proton transfer is a quantum mechanical process , therefore there is bound to be some arbitrariness in how one models it at a classical level .",
    "here we have chosen the range of the square well potential to be one hydrogen bond .",
    "if one changes this distance , the depth of the potential will have to be modified to obtain an optimal fit of the surface tension of hcl solution .",
    "however once this is done , the values of the surface tension of other acids will not be significantly affected .",
    "thus , the strength of h@xmath34 potential is the only free parameter of the theory .",
    "the total potential felt by h@xmath34 is then , @xmath40 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",

    ".ion classification into chaotropes ( c ) and kosmotropes ( k ) .",
    "effective radii ( hydrated or partially hydrated ) for kosmotropes and ( bare ) for chaotropes , for which we have also include the polarizabilities from ref . @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]    clearly these values are an exaggeration of the total electrostatic potential difference across the interface , since at finite temperature there will not be perfect alignment of interfacial hydronium ions .",
    "nevertheless , the theory should provide us an order of magnitude estimate of the electrostatic potential difference .",
    "in fact , for most acids we find a reasonable agreement between the predictions of the theory and frumkin s experimental measurements  @xcite .",
    "a noticeable exception is the hf .",
    "experimental potential for hydrogen fluoride measured by frumkin is negative , while we find a large positive value .",
    "frumkin s value for hf is clearly outside the general trend for halogen acids . in his classical review of electrolyte solutions ,",
    "randles @xcite did not mention frumkin s result for hf acid , while discussing his other measurements .",
    "we can only suppose that randles also did not have a complete confidence in this particular value .",
    "experimental measurements of excess surface potentials are very difficult .",
    "this is probably the reason why frumkin s measurements of surface potentials of acids have not been repeated in over 90 years .",
    "in this paper we have developed a theory for surface tensions of acid solutions .",
    "the hydronium adsorption to the interface was modeled by a square well potential , the depth of which is the only adjustable parameter of the theory .",
    "the agreement between the theory and experiments is very reasonable for different acid solutions at concentrations from 0 to 1 m . in order to account for the experimental values of the excess electrostatic surface potential",
    ", we must require a preferential orientation of hydronium ion at the interface , with the hydrogens pointing into the bulk . with this assumption",
    "we get a qualitative agreement with the experimental measurements of the excess electrostatic potentials of various acid solutions . at the moment",
