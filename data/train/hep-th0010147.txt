    "the compositeness of vector boson @xcite@xcite is a interesting subject in present particle physics .",

    "the kinetic term of gauge field , however , be derived from the quantum fluctuations of matter field , in which the gauge field becomes consequently dynamical one , and then the gauge boson is regarded as a composite which is composed of the matter fields .",
    "when we consider the higher - order contributions of the model , tremendous divergences prevent us to solve perturbatively the problem of composite state . in order to obtain physical predictions ,",
    "people use the ladder approximation or the renormalization group equation . in these method",
    ", the contributions from particular diagrams are calculated through the expansion with gauge coupling constant . for a solution of the problem of composite state",
    ", we use the gauge theory with the compositeness condition @xcite , and then consider the contributions from next - to - leading diagrams through the @xmath2 expansion where @xmath3 is the number of matter - fermion flavors . in general , the gauge field theory with the compositeness condition @xmath0 is reduced to the composite gauge field theory with the finite cutoff @xmath10 ( i.e. new physics scale ) where @xmath1 is the wave function renormalization constant of the gauge field .",
    "the gauge field theory with @xmath0 provides a useful method to investigate the composite gauge field when the physical cutoff scale @xmath10 is very large than the present energy scale .",
    "hence we calculate the renormalization constant @xmath1 with the @xmath2 expansion within the gauge field theory .",
    "then the information of composite gauge field theory can be obtained from the gauge field theory with @xmath0 .    in the previous papers @xcite , k. akama and the present author investigated the compositeness condition in abelian ( @xmath11 ) and non - abelian ( @xmath12 ) gauge field theories at next - to - leading order @xmath2 .",
    "the compositeness condition in nambu - jona - lasinio model @xcite at the next - to - leading order was investigated in ref .",

    "iv , we obtain the expression to the gauge coupling constant through the compositeness condition . in sec .",
    "v , we give the conclusions of this paper .",
    "we consider the composite gauge field theory with @xmath3 matter fermions @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) each of which belong to the representation of color gauge group @xmath7 .",
    "the lagrangian is given by the following gauge invariant form without the kinetic term of bare gauge field , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the generator of gauge group @xmath7 , and @xmath17 is the bare mass of matter fermions @xmath13 .",
    "for example , if we consider the matter fermions @xmath13 which belong to the fundamental representation of @xmath12 group , then @xmath16 is given by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , where @xmath20 are the @xmath12 gell - mann matrices . in ( [ la ] ) , the fields @xmath21 may be regarded as auxiliary field without independent dynamical degree of freedom , because if we use the euler equation with respect to @xmath22 for ( [ la ] ) , then @xmath23 give the constraint condition with respect to @xmath22 , as follows @xmath24 the kinetic term of non - abelian gauge field is induced through quantum fluctuation of the fermion fields @xmath13 , and hence the gauge field becomes dynamical one .",
    "this implies that the gauge boson is a composite made of a pair of the fermion @xmath13 and its anti - particle .",
    "we note that ( [ la ] ) corresponds to strong coupling limit @xmath25 of the following nambu - jona - lasinio type model , where @xmath26 is the coupling constant @xmath27 which is equivalent to @xmath28 the theory ( [ la ] ) involves severe ultraviolet divergences . in order to absorb the divergences in part , we rescale the fields and the mass as @xmath29 then ( [ la ] ) is rewritten as @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are rescaling factors for the bare quantities @xmath13 , @xmath21 , and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "now we see that the composite gauge field theory ( [ la ] ) is the special case of the ordinary gauge field theory specified by the compositeness condition @xmath0 . the non - abelian gauge theory with gauge field @xmath34 and fermionic fields @xmath13",
    "is given by the lagrangian @xmath35 with @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the gauge coupling constant , and @xmath38 is the structure constant of gauge group @xmath7 . in order to absorb the ultraviolet divergences in quantum corrections , we renormalize the bare quantities in ( [ lg ] ) as @xmath39 then ( [ lg ] ) is rewritten as @xmath40 with @xmath41 , where the quantities with the subscript `` r '' are the renormalized ones , and @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath1 , and @xmath44 are the renormalization constants .",
    "when we use the following copmositeness condition for the non - abelian gauge field , @xmath45 ( [ lgr ] ) reduces to @xmath46 in which the kinetic term of non - abelian gauge field @xmath47 vanishes .",
    "if we set the following equalities , @xmath48 then ( [ lgrc ] ) is identical to ( [ lar ] ) .",
    "hence the non - abelian gauge field theory ( [ lg ] ) with @xmath0 is equivalent to the composite gauge field theory ( [ la ] ) .    hereafter we consider the gauge field theory ( [ lg ] ) with compositeness condition ( @xmath0 ) in order to investigate the composite gauge field . in the calculation of quantum effects , we need to fix the gauge to guarantee that the inversed gauge boson propagator exists . then the gauge fixing term and the faddeev - popov ghost term are introduced into ( [ lg ] ) and ( [ lgr ] ) , as follows @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the gauge fixing parameter , and @xmath51 is the faddeev - popov ghost field , and @xmath52 is the renormalization constant for @xmath53 .",
    "the gauge fixing in ( [ lgfix ] ) dos not alter the physical quantities , and hence ( [ lgfix ] ) is equivalent to ( [ lg ] ) and ( [ lgr ] ) @xcite .      in order to find @xmath1 ,",
    "we use rather @xmath2 expansion than usual perturbation expansion with the coupling constant @xmath54 , because the latter expansion fails under the compositeness condition ( @xmath0 ) @xcite . at the leading order in @xmath2 expansion , @xmath1",
    "is chosen so as to cancel the divergence to the one - fermion - loop diagram a in fig.[figone ] , where the solid and wavy lines indicate the fermion and the gauge boson propagators , respectively . in the dimensional regularization , the one - loop vacuum polarization tensor is given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the momentum of external gauge boson line , and @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 with the number of space - time dimensions @xmath59 .",

    "when we use the compositeness condition ( [ comp ] ) to ( [ z0l ] ) , the gauge coupling constant @xmath54 is expressed as @xmath70 for the gauge coupling constant @xmath54 , ( [ g0l ] ) gives the result at the leading order @xmath71 in @xmath2 expansion .",
    "notice that ( [ g0l ] ) coincides with the known result of the composite gauge field theory @xcite@xcite .",

    "we consider the next - to - leading contributions to renormalization constant @xmath1 in @xmath2 expansion .",
    "the diagrams are classified by powers of @xmath74 instead of powers of the coupling constant @xmath54 . in fig.[figone ] ( b  h ) , we show the diagrams for the next - to - leading contribution in the @xmath2 expansion , where the disks stand for insertions of an arbitrary number of one - fermion loops into the gauge boson propagator .",
    "in addition to the one - boson - loop diagrams b and c , the multi - loop diagrams ( d  h ) belong to this order , because the gauge boson propagator with the fermion - loops inserted has the same order in @xmath75 as the usual gauge boson propagator .",
