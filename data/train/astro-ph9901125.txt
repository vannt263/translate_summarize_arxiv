    "high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) are accreting neutron stars or black holes with an early spectral type ( o or b ) mass - donating stellar companion .",
    "these objects lie near the galactic plane and so , unless unusually close , typically are found at low galactic latitudes .",
    "surveys of the galactic plane have thus revealed a number of hmxbs , and observations with the ginga satellite in particular revealed a large number of sources in the region of the plane located in scutum ( e.g. koyama et al . 1990 ) which may correspond to the 5 kpc galactic arm .",
    "many of these objects are transient and are thought to be be / neutron star binary systems .",
    "their transient nature arises because of both the variable envelope around a be star , from which a compact object accretes , and the eccentric orbit of the compact object as accretion may often occur only close to the time of periastron passage .",
    "in addition to the transient be star systems , other interesting x - ray sources have been found in this region of the plane such as the `` braking x - ray pulsar '' axj1845.0 - 0300 ( torii et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in order to investigate this region in more detail and , in particular , to search for new transient sources",
    ", we are monitoring this section of the galactic plane using the proportional counter array ( pca ) on board the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) satellite .",
    "we report here the discovery of a new source , the detection pulsations with a 361 s period , a measurement of the orbital period with the rxte all - sky monitor ( asm ) , and a measurement of the x - ray spectrum including the detection of an iron line .",
    "in this paper we present the results of observations of  that have been made with the instruments onboard rxte ( bradt , rothschild , & swank 1983 ) : the proportional counter array ( pca ) , the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) , and the all sky - monitor ( asm ) .",
    "the pca is described in detail by jahoda et al .",
    "this detector consists of five nearly identical , proportional counter units ( pcus ) sensitive to x - rays with energies between 2 - 60 kev with a total effective area of 6500 @xmath0 .",
    "the pcus each have a multi - anode xenon - filled volume , with a front propane volume which is primarily used for background rejection .",
    "for the entire pca across the complete energy band the crab produces a count rate of 13,000 counts / s .",
    "the pca spectral resolution at 6 kev is approximately 18% and the field of view is 1  full width half maximum .",
    "the high - energy hexte instrument on board rxte ( rothschild et al . 1998 ) is coaligned with the pca and is sensitive to x - rays in the range of 15 - 250 kev .",
    "hexte consists of two clusters , each of which itself consists of four phoswich scintillation detectors . during the observations of  the two clusters",
    "were rocked to positions @xmath11.5offset from the source position every 32 seconds so as to provide a continuous monitor of the background level .",
    "the all - sky monitor ( levine et al . 1996 ) consists of three similar scanning shadow cameras , sensitive to x - rays in an energy band of approximately 2 - 12 kev , which perform sets of 90 second pointed observations ( `` dwells '' ) so as to cover 80% of the sky every 90 minutes .",
    "the analysis presented here makes use of both daily averaged light curves and light curves from individual dwell data .",
    "light curves are available in three energy bands : 1.3 to 3.0 kev , 3.0 to 4.8 kev , and 4.8 to 12.2 kev .",
    "the crab produces approximately 75 counts / s in the asm over the entire energy range and asm observations of blank field regions away from the galactic center suggest that background subtraction may yield a systematic uncertainty of about 0.1 counts / s ( remillard & levine 1997 ) . in order to be able to obtain the light curve of an x - ray source the location of the source on the sky must be known to an accuracy of at least a few arc minutes .",
    "scans parallel to the galactic plane in the scutum region have been made approximately every other week starting 24 february 1998 .",
    "each observation consists of scans between galactic longitudes 15and 40  at galactic latitudes of -1.5 , 0.0 , and 1.5 .",
    "the subject of this paper , xte j1855 - 026 , is in the field - of - view of the pca for about 20 seconds during each scan at a latitude of -1.5 .",
    "the new x - ray source  was first noted as active on 1998 may 6th .",
    "an additional scan was then made across the source position perpendicular to the galactic plane to obtain an improved location for this source .",
    "a further pointed observation was then made on may 12 from 19:12 to 21:37 .",
    "data were collected in the `` good xenon '' mode which provides maximum spectral and timing information from the pca . however , for simplicity of analysis , in this paper we primarily utilize `` standard mode 2 '' data collected at the same time .",
    "this provides the same spectral information as the good xenon modes although at a reduced time resolution of 16 seconds .",
    "this is sufficient for our analysis presented here due to the relatively long source pulsation period .",
    "data were collected from hexte in `` e_8us_256_dx1f '' mode as well as the usual archive mode but our analysis here uses only the archive mode data .",
    "the position of  was determined by comparing the observed light curve in the 2 - 10 kev band during scans across the source with the expected behavior as the source moved through the pca field - of - view .",
    "the galactic longitude was determined from the scan at a latitude of -1.5  on 6 may 1998 , and the galactic latitude was determined using a scan on 8 may 1998 at the longitude estimated from the 6 may scan . in determining the source position we also included a model of emission from the nearby source x1845 - 024 . also present , but",
    "not included in the model , is unresolved emission from the galactic ridge , which is difficult to treat because of the non - imaging nature of the pca . from these scans",
    "we derive a best - fit position of ra = 18h 55 m 30s , dec .",
    "-02  34  52  with an estimated uncertainty at the 90% confidence level of 2 arc minutes including systematic effects .",
    "we have 11 scanning observations of the scutum region obtained between 1998 may 11 and september 23 .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev flux detected from the source during scans varied from a lower level of an upper limit of about 10 counts / s to a maximum of 136 @xmath1 15 counts / s on 6 may 1998 .      the light curve obtained from the pointed pca observation",
    "is shown in figure 1 and directly from the light curve itself pulsations can clearly be seen .",
    "this is confirmed by a fourier transform of the pca light curve which gives the power spectrum shown in figure 2 .",
    "there is strong modulation at a period of 360 s. a sine wave fit to the light curve yields a pulse period of 361.1 @xmath1 0.4 s. the light curve folded on that period in several energy bands is plotted in figure 3 .",
    "we note that the pulse profile shows little change between the different energy bands .",
    "a spectrum of  was extracted using layer 1 data from the pca , as the signal to noise ratio is highest for this layer for faint sources .",
    "an instrumental response matrix was generated using version 2.36 of `` pcarsp '' which accounts for small time dependent gain changes in the pca .",
    "an estimate of the time - dependent background flux was obtained using `` pcabackest '' together with a model suitable for faint sources .",
    "no additional `` systematic '' errors were added to the resulting spectrum , although the background estimation software itself does somewhat overestimate the errors ( k. jahoda private communication ) .",
    "a hexte spectrum were extracted for each of the clusters using standard software which includes background subtraction via the off - source rocking position observations . due to relative calibration uncertainties , in all",
    "spectral fits the normalization of the spectrum was a free parameter for both the pca and hexte spectra with all other parameters linked .",
    "we first fitted the combined pca / hexte spectrum with the standard pulsar model ( e.g. white , swank , & holt 1983 ) of an absorbed power law with a high energy cut - off .",
    "this failed to give a good fit with large residuals appearing near 6.4 kev .",
    "the addition of a gaussian line ( equivalent width 360 ev ) significantly improved the fit .",
    "however , a large excess over the model still appears at low energies ( below 3 kev ) . since the efficiency of the pca falls off rapidly at low energies , and interstellar absorption",
    "strongly reduces the flux at these energies , any interpretation of this excess as arising from the intrinsic spectrum of the source must be treated with caution .",
    "inaccuracies in the wings of the instrument response function might have major effects for this type of spectrum ( k. jahoda private communication ) .",
    "the parameters of this fit are given in table 1 and the spectrum together with the power law plus high - energy cut - off model are shown in figure 4 .",
    "for an unabsorbed spectrum we find a flux from the fitted model of 1.9@xmath210@xmath3 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath5 between 2 to 10 kev while the absorbed spectrum has a flux of 1.1@xmath210@xmath3 ergs @xmath4 s@xmath5 .",
    "the position obtained from the pca scans enabled a 2 - 12 kev light curve to be obtained for  with the asm , and this is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the mean flux is 0.51 counts per second which corresponds to approximately 7 mcrab .",
    "a fourier transform of this light curve yields the power spectrum shown in figure 6 .",
    "a prominent feature of the power spectrum is a highly significant peak at approximately 6.1 days and a harmonic of this . to further quantify the modulation on this period we fitted a sine wave and find a best fit period of 6.067 @xmath1 0.004 days and an amplitude of 0.12 @xmath1 0.02 asm counts / second . in figure 7",
    "we show the asm light curve folded on this period .",
    "the epoch of maximum flux derived from the sine wave fit is mjd 50289.1 @xmath1 0.15 and the initial source detection and the pointed observations thus both occurred at orbital phases of approximately 0.25 .    in order to investigate any long term source variability we divided the asm light curve into three sections and examined these for any change in the orbital modulation amplitude or mean",
    "intensity and no significant changes were found , although the last data section is noisier due to the inclusion of observations performed when the source was close to the position of the sun .",
    "many of the objects found during slews of this region are transient and are suspected to belong to the large be / neutron star class of high mass x - ray binary",
    ". however , the orbital period of 6 days would be very short for a be star system .",
    "the shortest orbital period known for such systems is 16.7 days and belongs to the extreme system a0538 - 66 ( e.g. skinner et al .",
    "a search for cataloged objects within this region using skyview and simbad did not find any objects within our position for .",
    "although an earlier preliminary position for the source had included the 12th magnitude be star bd -024786 at ra = 18 56 03.36 , dec .",
    "= -02 37 31.1 ( marshall & takeshima 1998 ) this is now apparently excluded by the more complete position determination presented here ( section 3.1 ) .",
    "although there are a few x - ray pulsars that are found in low - mass systems , the vast majority of x - ray pulsars are found in hmxbs ( e.g. bildsten et al .",
    "the known high - mass x - ray binaries show a clustering into three groups ( be stars , roche - lobe overflow , and supergiant stellar wind accretion ) when plotted on a diagram of pulse period against orbital period ( corbet 1986 ) .",
    "the be star systems show a general correlation between these two parameters .",
    "if the parameters of  are plotted on such a diagram ( figure 8) then the source lies in the middle of the region that , so far , has only been occupied by supergiant wind accretion driven systems .",
    "supergiant wind accretion systems , although exhibiting significant short - term variability ( see e.g. haberl , white & kallman 1989 ) probably caused by inhomogeneities in the stellar wind , would be expected to be essentially persistent sources integrated over longer time scales .",
    "they would not be expected to show the on / off type behavior exhibited by be star systems which occurs due to the appearance and disappearance of their circumstellar envelopes .",
    "the slews over  with the pca do show source variability but the asm light curve indicates persistence during the period observed .",
    "we note that some of the variability from the slew observations may be due to the short slew time across the source ( 20 s ) compared to the 361 s pulse period .",
    "if  is persistent then it should also have been detected in other observations that covered this region .",
    "ginga undertook several scans of this area ( koyama et al .",
    "1989 , 1990 ) and  lies close to the nominal error box for source number 6 of koyama et al .",
    "( 1990 ) (= source number 1 of koyama et al .",
    "in addition , the exosat slew catalog source ems b1851 - 024 ( reynolds et al .",
    "1998 ) has an error box which lies close to that of .",
    "if these sources detected with ginga and exosat do indeed correspond to , then this would be additional evidence , beyond that provided by the multi - year asm lightcurve , that  is a persistent source .",
    "further evidence for the supergiant nature of  may come from the orbital light curve and the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the shape of the asm light curve folded on the orbital period is somewhat reminiscent of the supergiant systems vela x-1 and 2s0114 + 650 ( e.g. corbet , finley & peele 1999 ) .",
    "the spectral characteristics of supergiant and be star systems are also different and supergiant systems typically show much stronger iron line emission which can also be highly orbital phase dependent ( e.g. ohashi et al .",
    "1984 , nagase et al .",
    "the strength of the iron line detected from  is consistent with a supergiant classification .",
    "the iron line parameters appear to indicate a significant width ( 0.4 kev ) although , with the spectral resolution of the rxte pca , we can not determine if this is actually due to the presence of multiple line components . although it is likely that the apparent low energy excess in  is an instrumental artifact we note that , for example , the supergiant system vela x-1 does show strong low energy emission lines from neon , magnesium and silicon ( nagase et al .",
    "1994 ) and similar emission from  might contribute to a low energy excess over a simple model .",
    "many of the transient sources detected with ginga in this region by koyama et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1990 ) are suspected to lie in the  5 kpc arm \" which is at a distance from us of approximately 10 kpc . for this distance",
    "the unabsorbed flux measured with the pca corresponds to a luminosity of 2@xmath210@xmath6 ergs s@xmath5 which is broadly consistent with the flux expected from a wind accretion system ( e.g. van paradijs 1995 ) .",
    "the absorption that we measure is also comparable to that found for other sources in this region ( koyama et al .",
    "1989 , 1990 ) and is consistent with the predicted interstellar absorption for this region ( hayakawa et al .",
    "we note that the x - ray absorption , if interstellar rather than due to material local to the neutron star , would imply a very large optical reddening of approximately e(b - v ) = 24 ( bohlin , savage & drake 1978 ) greatly impeding observations at other wavelengths such as optical and in soft x - rays .",
    "such an interstellar absorption would also indicate that bd -024786 is not the optical counterpart .",
    "the orbital period and pulse period of  suggest that this may be a supergiant wind accretion powered high mass x - ray binary . as members of this class show persistent emission ,",
    "most readily observable galactic members of this class may already have been found and this would be the first new member of this class discovered for some time .",
    "however , if  is , instead , a be type system , then it would have the shortest known orbital period of all members of this class .",
    "further observations to measure the mass function via doppler shifts of the pulses and determine a more precise position would be valuable .",
