    "a layered @xmath25 ph structure is predicted to be stable in the range 0.052 gpa .",
    "the @xmath2 structure is a new structure prototype not found in databases that we have discovered using airss .",
    "it has mixed @xmath3 and @xmath4 bonding and is predicted to be stable in the range 211 gpa .",
    "c@xmath0n@xmath1 therefore differs from pure carbon in that there is a thermodynamically stable phase between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bonded forms .",
    "this structure could be accessible through suitable precursors and synthetic routes at low pressure .",
    "the relative stabilities of the most favorable c@xmath0n@xmath1 have uncertainties due to the use of approximate density functionals which amount to a few gpa at low pressures .",
    "we have , however , sought to assess the sizes of these errors by comparing with results for the related graphite / carbon diamond system .",
    "airss has predicted new @xmath25 , @xmath2 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath5 c@xmath0n@xmath1 structures to have regions of thermodynamic stability and , in addition , the new @xmath24 structure is almost stable .",
    "our calculations predict decomposition of c@xmath0n@xmath1 at pressures above 650 gpa into diamond and pyrite - structured cn@xmath6 .",
    "our experimental study has provided strong evidence for the synthesis in laser - heated diamond anvil cell experiments of the newly - predicted @xmath2 structure .",
    "the identification of a new family of structures with mixed @xmath3 and @xmath4 bonding opens up a new area of exploration for these important photo- and catalytically active solid materials .",
