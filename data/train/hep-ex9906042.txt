    "wide band neutrino beams provide an unique opportunity to measure @xmath2 , the ratio of the longitudinal and transverse structure functions , and the difference between @xmath6 and @xmath1 .",
    "a measurement of @xmath2 provides a test of perturbative qcd at large @xmath7 , and probes the gluon density at small @xmath7 .",
    "a non - zero @xmath8 originates from the difference between the contributions of the strange and charm seas in the nucleon to massive charm quark production .",
    "thus , a measurement of @xmath3 can be used to extract the strange sea , and to understand massive charm production in neutrino - nucleon scattering .",
    "previously , information on the strange sea came from the exclusive dimuon events channel ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 )  @xcite .",
    "the dimuon analysis requires both an understanding of charm fragmentation and an acceptance correction for the detection of muons from charm decays . in previous extractions of structure functions",
    "@xcite , a leading order slow rescaling correction for heavy charm production was applied in order to extract a theoretically corrected @xmath13 which could be directly compared with @xmath14 . however , because of theoretical uncertainties in the treatment of massive charm production  @xcite , this correction is no longer applied in this analysis .",
    "furthermore , the value of @xmath3 plays a crucial role in the extraction of @xmath15 at low @xmath7 , where there is a long - standing discrepancy  @xcite between ccfr and nmc @xmath15 data .",
    "therefore , it is important to measure the structure functions without any model - dependent slow rescaling corrections .",
    "the ccfr experiment collected data using the fermilab tevatron quad - triplet wide - band @xmath16 and @xmath17 beam .",
    "the ccfr detector  @xcite consists of an unmagnetized steel - scintillator target calorimeter instrumented with drift chambers , followed by a toroidally magnetized muon spectrometer .",
    "the hadron energy resolution is @xmath18(gev ) , and the muon momentum resolution is @xmath19 . by measuring the hadronic energy ( @xmath20 ) , muon momentum ( @xmath21 ) , and muon angle ( @xmath22 ) , we construct three independent kinematic variables @xmath7 , @xmath4 , and @xmath23 . the relative flux at different energies obtained from the events with low hadron energy ( @xmath24 gev ) is normalized so that the neutrino total cross section equals the world average @xmath25 @xmath26/gev and @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the total data sample used for the extraction of structure functions consists of 1,030,000 @xmath28 and 179,000 @xmath29 events after fiducial and kinematic cuts ( @xmath30 gev , @xmath31 , @xmath32 gev , and 30 gev @xmath33 360 gev ) .",
    "dimuon events are removed because of the ambiguous identification of the leading muon for high-@xmath23 events .",
    "the differential cross sections are determined in bins of @xmath7 , @xmath23 , and @xmath34 ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 gev ) . over the entire @xmath7 region ,",
    "differential cross sections are in good agreement with nlo mixed flavour scheme ( mfs )  @xcite qcd calculation using the mrst  @xcite pdfs .",
    "this calculation includes an improved treatment of massive charm production .",
    "figure [ fig : diff ] shows typical differential cross sections at @xmath38 gev .",
    "also shown are the prediction from a lo qcd model , which is only used in the calculation of acceptance and resolution smearing correction . the ccfr data exhibit a quadratic @xmath23 dependence at small @xmath7 for neutrino and anti - neutrino , and a flat @xmath23 distribution at high @xmath7 for the neutrino cross section .",
    "note that the @xmath23 distributions of the cdhsw  @xcite differential cross sections data do not agree with those of ccfr data , or with the mrst predictions ( this difference is crucial in any qcd analysis ) .",
    "values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 are extracted from the sums of neutrino and anti - neutrino differential cross sections .",
    "the sum of the two differential cross sections can be written as :    @xmath39 = @xmath40   \\frac { ( 1-\\epsilon)\\pi}{y^2g_f^2me}$ ] + @xmath41 - \\frac { y(1-y/2)}{1+(1-y)^2 } \\delta xf_3 $ ]    where @xmath42 is the polarization of virtual @xmath43 boson .",
    "to fit @xmath3 , @xmath2 , and @xmath44 at a given @xmath7 and @xmath4 is very challenging because of the strong correlation between the @xmath3 and @xmath2 terms , unless the full range of @xmath45 is covered by the data . covering this range ( especially the low @xmath45 region correspoing to high @xmath23 )",
    "is difficult because of the low acceptance at high @xmath23 .",
    "since the contribution of @xmath3 to @xmath39 increases with @xmath4 while that from @xmath2 decreases , our strategy is to fit @xmath3 and @xmath44 for @xmath46 where the @xmath3 contribution is relatively larger , constraining @xmath2 with @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "( @xmath3 fits are done only for @xmath5 , because its contribution is small for @xmath48 . )",
    "it is reasonable to use @xmath47 ( an empirical fit for all available @xmath2 data ) , because above @xmath49 , @xmath2 for neutrino and muon scattering are expected to be the same , and @xmath47 is in good agreement with the nmc muon data  @xcite .    in the @xmath50 region , where the contribution from @xmath2 is larger , we fit @xmath2 and @xmath44 with @xmath3 constrained to the model predictions .",
    "this allows us to study the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath2 for neutrino scattering at low @xmath4 . in the @xmath46 region , we test which scheme is favored for the massive charm treatment , based on the extracted @xmath3 results .",
    "then the favored scheme is used in constraining @xmath3 for the @xmath50 analysis .    before the structure function extraction",
    ", we apply an electroweak radiative correction ( bardin ) and corrections for the @xmath43 boson propagator , and a non - isoscalar target ( the 6.85% excess of neutrons over protons in iron ; this effect is valid only at high @xmath7 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath3 and @xmath2 are sensitive to the energy dependence of the neutrino flux , but are insensitive to the absolute normalization . the uncertainty on the flux shape is estimated by using the constraint that @xmath15 and @xmath51 should be flat over @xmath23 ( or @xmath34 ) for each @xmath7 and @xmath4 bin .    in the @xmath3 fit , we use the nlo mfs calculation with mrst pdfs for the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath3 ( for @xmath52 ) , and fit for the level of @xmath3 for each @xmath7 bin below @xmath53 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dxf3 ] shows the @xmath54 data as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "the ccfr data favor the fixed flavour scheme ( ffs )  @xcite calculation with the grv94  @xcite pdfs , and also the mixed flavour scheme ( mfs ) using mrst pdfs .",
    "the data do not favor the vfs calculation with cteq4hq  @xcite as implemented by kramer , lampe , and spiesberger ( kls )  @xcite .",
    "the difference among the various schemes does not come from the different parton distributions , but rather from the different treatments of massive charm .",
    "in fact , all strange sea distributions in these parton distributions agree with the ccfr dimuon data  @xcite .",
    "recently olness and kretzer  @xcite pointed out that kls did not include the lo charm sea diagram in the vfs implementation , as required in the original acot s vfs calculation  @xcite .",
    "the acot s vfs calculations agree with data after the inclusion of the charm sea contribution , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dxf3 ] .    since all three schemes except kls vfs",
    "show a good agreement with data , we use a mfs calculation with mrst pdfs ( arguably the most reasonable theoretical description of massive charm production currently available ) to constrain @xmath3 for the extraction of @xmath2 for @xmath50 and @xmath5 . even for @xmath46",
    ", we extract @xmath2 in order to investigate its @xmath4 dependence .",
    "the extracted values of @xmath2 at fixed @xmath7 vs @xmath4 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] .",
    "the new data reveal the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath2 at @xmath5 for the first time ( @xmath2 decreases as @xmath4 increases for fixed @xmath7 ) .",
    "the nmc data shown in fig .  [ fig : r ] are integrated over @xmath4 , and the two nearest nmc @xmath7 bins are shown together . at higher",
    "@xmath7 , our measurements agree with the other world data for @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : r ] also shows a comparison with @xmath47 with @xmath55 ( muon scattering or with slow rescaling correction in neutrino scattering ) and @xmath56 ( without slow rescaling correction in neutrino scattering ) .",
    "the ccfr @xmath2 data at @xmath57 do not show @xmath2 approaching zero as @xmath4 goes zero ( as expected in neutrino scattering , but not in electron scattering ) .",
    "new measurements of @xmath3 and @xmath2 have been extracted from the ccfr differential cross section data .",
    "the @xmath2 data are extended to lower @xmath7 and higher @xmath4 than previous measurements .",
    "the @xmath4 dependence of @xmath2 at lower @xmath7 region has been measured for the first time .",
    "the @xmath3 data from @xmath46 region agree with various schemes for the treatment of massive charm production . further reduction of the errors in @xmath3 is expected by including lower @xmath4 data .",
    "the effect of @xmath3 on the extraction of @xmath15 is currently under study .",
    "in addition , new data from the recent nutev run ( 1996 - 97 ) , taken with sign selected neutrino beams , are expected to yield more precise determinations of @xmath3 , @xmath15 and @xmath2 at low @xmath7 ."
