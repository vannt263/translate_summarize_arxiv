    "weakly - coupled antiferromagnetic ( af ) @xmath10 chains can be close to one or several quantum critical points and serve as interesting model systems in which to explore strongly - correlated quantum order .",
    "an isolated af @xmath10 heisenberg chain , described by @xmath11is quantum critical at zero temperature . due to the absence of a length scale at a critical point ,",
    "the spin correlations decay as a power law , and the fundamental excitations are fractional spin excitations called spinons that carry @xmath10.@xcite interactions that break the symmetry of the ground state can induce transitions to ground states of distinctly different symmetry , such as one - dimensional long - range order at zero temperature in the presence of an ising anisotropy or conventional three - dimensional long - range order at finite temperature in the presence of weak non - frustrating interchain interactions.@xcite    magnetic fields break spin rotational symmetry and allow tuning the spin hamiltonian in a controlled way . when it couples identically to all sites in a spin chain , an external field uniformly magnetizes the chain and leads to novel gapless excitations that are incommensurate with the lattice .",
    "experimentally this is observed with methods that couple directly to the spin correlation functions , such as neutron scattering .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering experiments on model af @xmath10 chain systems such as copper pyrazine dinitrate @xcite show that upon application of a uniform magnetic field there are gapless excitations at an incommensurate wave vector that moves across the brillouin zone with increasing field.@xcite this is expected to be a rather general feature of a partially magnetized quantum spin system without long range spin order at @xmath12 . when even and odd sites of the spin chain experience different effective fields , there is an entirely different ground state which is separated by a finite gap from excited states .",
    "this has been observed in magnetic materials with staggered crystal field environments and dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions .",
    "most notably , the generation of an excitation energy gap was first observed in copper benzoate using neutron scattering @xcite and the entire excitation spectrum of the @xmath10 chain in the presence of an effective staggered field was mapped out in @xmath13 ( cdc ) @xcite .",
    "these experiments showed that the excitation spectrum in high staggered fields consists of solitons and breathers that can be described as bound spinon states , and that the one - dimensional character of the spinon potential leads to high - energy excitations that are not present in the absence of staggered fields.@xcite    in this paper , we explore the strongly anisotropic field dependence of long range magnetic order in cdc . using neutron scattering ,",
    "we have directly measured the order parameters associated with the various competing phases .",
    "we show that a magnetic field destroys the low - field long - range order that is induced by super - exchange interactions involving @xmath14 cations , and that an applied field induces a first - order spin - flop transition followed by a second - order quantum phase transition .",
    "field - dependent specific heat measurements provide evidence for a gapless excitation spectrum in the low - field phase and an energy gap for larger fields .",
    "these results combined with neutron measurements enable a comprehensive characterization of the dominant spin interactions in this system , including a quantitative determination of the staggered gyromagnetic tensor and the dm interactions , which give rise to the field - induced gap .",

    "@xmath25 is the uniform and @xmath26 is the staggered part of the @xmath22 factor .",
