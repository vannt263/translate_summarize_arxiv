    "as light from distant galaxies passes through the mass distribution in the universe , its trajectory gets perturbed , causing the apparent galaxy shapes to be distorted .",
    "weak lensing statistically measures this small distortion , or `` shear '' , for a large number of galaxies to infer the 3d matter distribution .",
    "this allows us to constrain cosmological parameters and study the distribution of mass in the universe .",
    "since its first discovery , the accuracy and statistical precision of weak lensing measurements have improved significantly @xcite .",
    "most of these previous studies constrain cosmology through n - point statistics of the shear signal @xcite . in this paper , however , we focus on generating 2d wide - field projected mass maps from the measured shear @xcite .",
    "these mass maps are particularly useful for viewing the non - gaussian distribution of dark matter in a different way than is possible with n - point statistics .",
    "probing the dark matter distribution in the universe is particularly important for several reasons .",
    "based on the peak statistics from a mass map it is possible to identify dark matter halos and constrain cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "mass maps also allow us to study the connection between baryonic matter ( both in stellar and gaseous forms ) and dark matter @xcite .",
    "this can be measured by cross correlating light maps and gas maps with weak lensing mass maps .",
    "correlation with light maps , which can be constructed using observed galaxies , groups and clusters of galaxies etc .",
    ", can be used to constrain galaxy bias , the mass - to - light ratio , and the dependence of these statistics on redshift and environment @xcite .",
    "however , one needs to take caution when interpreting the weak lensing mass maps , as the completeness and purity of structure detection via these maps is not very high due to their noisy nature @xcite .",
    "one other interesting application of the mass map is that it allows us to identify large scale structures ( both super - clusters and voids ) which are otherwise difficult to find @xcite .",
    "characterizing the statistics of large structures can be a sensitive probe of cosmological models .",
    "structures with masses as high or higher than clusters require special attention as the massive end of the halo mass function is very sensitive to the cosmology @xcite .",
    "these rare structures also allows us to constrain different theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "in addition to the study of the largest assemblies of mass , the study of number density of the largest voids allows further tests of the @xmath3cdm model @xcite .",
    "similar mass mapping technique as used in this paper has been previously applied to the canada - france - hawaii telescope lensing survey ( cfhtlens ) as presented in @xcite .",
    "their work demonstrated the potential scientific value of these wide - field lensing mass maps , including measuring high - order moments of the maps and cross - correlation with galaxy densities .",
    "the total area of the mass map in that work is similar to our dataset , though it was divided into four separate smaller fields .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to construct a weak lensing mass map from a contiguous 139 deg@xmath4 area in the dark energy survey ( des , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) science verification ( sv ) data , which overlaps with the south pole telescope survey ( the spt - e field ) .",
    "the sv data were recorded using the newly commissioned wide - field mosaic camera , the dark energy camera ( decam ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the 4 m blanco telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile .",
    "we cross correlate this reconstructed mass map with optically identified structures such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies .",
    "this work opens up several directions for future explorations with these mass maps .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in",
    "we describe the theoretical foundation and methodology for constructing the mass maps and galaxy density maps used in this paper .",
    "we then describe in the des dataset used in this work , together with the simulation used to interpret our results . in",
    "we present the reconstructed mass maps .",
    "we discuss qualitatively in the correlation of these maps with known foreground structures found via independent optical techniques . in , we quantify the wide - field mass - to - light correlation on different spatial scales using the full field .",
    "we show that our results are consistent with expectations from simulations . in we estimate the level of contamination by systematics in our results from a wide range of sources .",
    "finally , we conclude in . for a summary of the main results from this work , see the companion paper in prl @xcite .",
    "in this section we first briefly review the principles of weak lensing in .",
    "then , we describe the adopted mass reconstruction method in . finally in , we describe our method of generating galaxy density maps .",
    "the galaxy density maps are used as independent mass tracers in this work to help confirm the signal measured in the weak lensing mass maps .",
    "when light from galaxies passes through a foreground mass distribution , the resulting bending of light leads to the galaxy images being distorted @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is called gravitational lensing .",
    "the local mapping between the source ( @xmath5 ) and image ( @xmath6 ) plane coordinates ( aside from an overall displacement ) can be described by the lens equation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the reference point in the source and the image plane .",
    "@xmath10 is the jacobian of this mapping , given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the convergence , @xmath13 is the reduced shear and @xmath14 is the shear .",
    "@xmath15 refers to the 2d coordinates in the plane .",
    "the factor @xmath16 causes galaxy images to be dilated or reduced in size , while the terms in the matrix cause distortion in the image shapes . under the born approximation , which assumes that the deflection of the light rays due to the lensing effect is small , @xmath10 is given by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the lensing deflection potential , or a weighted projection of the gravitational potential along the line of sight . for a spatially flat universe ,",
    "it is given by the line of sight integral of the 3d gravitational potential @xmath19 @xcite , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the comoving distance .",
    "comparison of with gives @xmath22 @xmath23 for the purpose of this paper , we use the limber approximation which lets us use the poisson equation for the density fluctuation @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the 3d density and mean density respectively ) : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the cosmological scale factor . and give the convergence measured at a sky coordinate @xmath29 from sources at comoving distance @xmath21 : @xmath30 we can generalize to sources with a distribution in comoving distance ( or redshift ) @xmath31 as : @xmath32 .",
    "that is , a @xmath12 map constructed over a region on the sky gives us the integrated mass density fluctuation in the foreground of the @xmath12 map weighted by the lensing weight @xmath33 , which is itself an integral over @xmath31 : @xmath34 with @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the comoving distance to the horizon .",
    "for a specified cosmological model and @xmath31 specified by the redshift distribution of source galaxies , the above equations provide the basis for predicting the statistical properties of @xmath12 .      in this paper",
    "we perform weak lensing mass reconstruction based on the method developed in @xcite .",
    "the kaiser - squires ( ks ) method is known to work well up to a constant additive factor as long as the structures are in the linear regime @xcite . in the non - linear regime ( scales corresponding to clusters or smaller structures ) improved methods have been developed to recover the mass distribution @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are interested in the mass distribution on large scales ; we can therefore restrict ourselves to the ks method .",
    "the ks method works as follows .",
    "the fourier transform of the observed shear , @xmath37 , relates to the fourier transform of the convergence , @xmath38 through @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 are the fourier counterparts for the angular coordinates @xmath42 , @xmath43 represent the two dimensions of sky coordinate .",
    "the above equations hold true for @xmath44 . in practice",
    "we apply a sinusoidal projection of sky with a reference point at ra=71.0 deg and then pixelize the observed shears with a pixel size of 5 arcmin before fourier transforming .",
    "given that we mainly focus on scales less than a degree in this paper , the errors due to the projection is small @xcite .",
    "the inverse fourier transform of gives the convergence for the observed field in real space .",
    "ideally , the imaginary part of the inverse fourier transform will be zero as the convergence is a real quantity .",
    "however , noise , systematics and masking causes the reconstruction to be imperfect , with non - zero imaginary convergence as we will quantify in .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the reconstructed convergence are referred to as the e- and b - mode of @xmath12 , respectively . in our reconstruction procedure",
    "we set shears to zero in the masked regions @xcite .",
    "we later quantify the effect of this step in .",
    "one of the issues with the ks inversion is that the uncertainty in the reconstructed convergence is formally infinite for a discrete set of noisy shear estimates .",
    "this is because the statistically uncorrelated ellipticities of galaxies result in a white noise power spectrum which integrates to infinity for large spatial frequencies .",
    "therefore we need to remove the high frequency components . for a gaussian filter of size @xmath2 the covariance of the statistical noise in the convergence map",
    "can be written as @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the standard deviation of the single component ellipticity ( which contains the intrinsic shape noise and measurement noise ) and @xmath47 is the number density of the source galaxies .",
    "implies that the shape noise contribution to the convergence map reduces with increasing size of the gaussian window and number density of the background source galaxies .",
    "in addition to the mass map generated from weak lensing measurements in , we also generate mass maps based on the assumption that galaxies are linearly biased tracers of mass in the foreground . in particular , we study two galaxy samples : the general field galaxies and the luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) . properties of the samples used in this work such as the redshift distribution , magnitude distribution etc .",
    "are described in . to compare with the weak lensing mass map , we assume that the bias is constant . however , bias may change with spatial scale , redshift , magnitude and other galaxy properties .",
    "this can introduce differences between the weak lensing mass map and foreground map . in this paper",
    "we neglect such effects since we mostly focus on large scales ( @xmath48 arcmin at @xmath49 ) where the departures from linear bias are small .    based on a given sample of mass tracer",
    "we generate a weighted foreground map ( @xmath50 ) after applying an appropriate lensing weight to each galaxy before pixelation . in principle",
    "the weight increases the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of the cross - correlation between the lensing mass map and the foreground density map .",
    "the lensing weight ( ) depends on the comoving distance to the source and lens , and the distance between them . to generate the weighted galaxy density map ,",
    "we first generate a 3d grid of the galaxies .",
    "we estimate the density contrast in each of these cells as follows : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the pixel index in the projected 2d sky and @xmath53 is the pixel index in the redshift direction . @xmath54 is the number of galaxies in the @xmath55 cell and @xmath56 is the average number of galaxies per pixel in the @xmath57 redshift bin .",
    "this 3d grid of galaxy density fluctuations will be used to estimate @xmath50 according to the discrete version of , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the weighted foreground map at the pixel @xmath52 ; @xmath53 and @xmath60 represent indices along the redshift direction for lens and source , @xmath61 is the physical size of the redshift bin , @xmath62 is the angular diameter distance to source , @xmath63 is the probability density of the source redshift distribution at redshift @xmath60 and @xmath64 is the foreground density fluctuation at angular diameter distance @xmath65 . in this work ,",
    "use a single source redshift bin and @xmath66 for the lens sample .",
    "we adopt the following cosmological parameters : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "our results depend very weakly on the exact values of these cosmological parameters .",
    "the measurements in this paper are based on 139 deg@xmath4 of data in the spt - e field , observed as part of the science verification ( sv ) data from des .",
    "the sv data were taken during the period of november 2012  february 2013 before the official start of the science survey .",
    "the data were taken shortly after decam commissioning and were used to test survey operations and assess data quality .",
    "five optical filters ( @xmath71 ) were used throughout the survey , with typical exposure times being 90 sec for @xmath72 and 45 sec for @xmath73 .",
    "the final median depth estimates of this data set in our region of interest are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( 10-@xmath2 galaxy limiting magnitude ) .    below we introduce in the relevant data used in this work .",
    "then we define in two subsamples of the sv data that we identify as `` foreground ( lens ) '' and `` background ( source ) '' galaxies for the main analysis of the paper . in",
    "we introduce the simulations we use to interpret our measurements .",
    "all galaxies used for foreground catalogs and lensing measurements are drawn from the des sva1 gold catalog ( rykoff et al .",
    ", in preparation ) and several extensions to it .",
    "the main catalog is a product of the des data management ( desdm ) pipeline version `` sva1 '' ( yanny et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "the desdm pipeline , as described in @xcite , begins with initial image processing on single - exposure images and astrometry measurements from the software package scamp @xcite .",
    "the single - exposure images were then stacked to produce co - add images using the software package swarp @xcite .",
    "basic object detection , point - spread - function ( psf ) modelling , star - galaxy classification and photometry were done on the individual images as well as the co - add images using software packages sextractor and psfex @xcite .",
    "the full sva1 gold dataset consists of 254.4 deg@xmath0 with @xmath72-band coverage , and @xmath78 deg@xmath0 for @xmath73 band .",
    "the main science goal for this work is to reconstruct wide - field mass maps ; as a result , we use the largest continuous region in the sv data : 139 deg@xmath4 in the spt - e field .",
    "the sva1 gold catalog is augmented by : a photometric redshift catalog , two galaxy shape catalogs , and an lrg catalog .",
    "these catalogs are described below .      in this work",
    "we use the photometric redshift ( photo-@xmath1 ) estimated with the bayesian photometric redshifts ( bpz ) code @xcite .",
    "the photo-@xmath1 s are used to select the main foreground and background sample ( see ) .",
    "the details and capabilities of bpz on early des data were already presented in @xcite , where it showed good performance among template - based codes .",
    "the primary set of templates used contains the @xcite templates , two starburst templates from @xcite and two younger starburst simple stellar population templates from @xcite , added to bpz in @xcite .",
    "we calibrate the bayesian prior by fitting the empirical function @xmath79 proposed in @xcite , using a spectroscopic sample matched to des galaxies and weighted to mimic the photometric properties of the des sv sample used in this work .",
    "as tested in @xcite , the bias in the photo-@xmath1 estimate is @xmath800.02 , with 68% scatter @xmath81 and the 3@xmath2 outlier fraction @xmath802% . for this work ,",
    "we use @xmath82 , the mean of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) output from bpz as a single - point estimate of the photo-@xmath1 to separate our galaxies into the foreground and background samples . other photo-@xmath1 codes used in des",
    "have been run on the same data . for this work",
    "we have also checked our main results in using an independent neural network code ( skynet ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we found that bpz and skynet gives consistent results ( within 1@xmath2 ) in terms of the cross - correlation between the weak lensing mass maps and the foreground galaxy map .",
    "based on the sva1 data , two shear catalogs were produced and tested extensively in jarvis et al .",
    "( in preparation ) : the ` ngmix ` ( version 011 ) catalog and the ` im3shape ` ( version 9 ) catalog .",
    "the main results shown in our paper are based on the ` ngmix ` catalog , but we also cross - check with the ` im3shape ` catalog to confirm that the results are statistically consistent .",
    "these catalogs are slightly earlier version from that described in jarvis et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .    the psf model for both methods",
    "are based on the single - exposure psf models from psfex .",
    "psfex models the psf as a linear combination of small images sampled on an ad hoc pixel grid , with coefficients that are the terms of a second - order polynomial of pixel coordinates in each decam ccd .    `",
    "ngmix `  @xcite is a general tool for fitting morphological models to images of astronomical objects .",
    "for the galaxy model , ` ngmix `  supports various options including exponential disk and de vaucouleurs profile @xcite , all of which are implemented approximately as a sum of gaussians @xcite .",
    "additionally , any number of gaussians can be fit .",
    "these gaussian fits can either be completely free or constrained to be co - centric and co - elliptical . for the des",
    "sv galaxy images , we used the exponential disk model . for the psf fitting , an expectation maximization @xcite approach is used to model the psf as a sum of three free gaussians .",
    "shear estimation was carried out using by jointly fitting multiple images in @xmath83 bands .",
    "the multi - band approach enabled a larger effective galaxy number density compared to the ` im3shape ` catalog , which is based on single - band images in the current version .    the ` im3shape ` @xcite implementation in this work estimates shapes by jointly fitting a parameterized galaxy model to all of the different single - exposure @xmath21-band images , finding the maximum likelihood solution .",
    "calibration for bias in the shear measurement associated with noise @xcite is applied . an earlier version of this code ( run on the co - add images instead of single - exposures ) has been run on the sv cluster fields for cluster lensing studies @xcite .",
    "details for both shape catalogs and the tests performed on these catalogs can be found in jarvis et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "both shear catalogs have been tested and shown to pass the requirements for sv cosmic shear measurement , which is much more stringent than what is required in this paper . as our analysis is insensitive to the overall multiplicative bias in the shear measurements ,",
    "we adopt the `` conservative additive '' selection ; this results in small additive systematic uncertainties , but possibly some moderate multiplicative systematic uncertainties . for ` ngmix ` , this selection removes galaxies with s / n@xmath8420 and very small galaxies ( gaussian sigma smaller than the pixel scale ) . for ` im3shape ` , it removes galaxies with s / n@xmath8415 . in both cases , there were many other selections applied to both catalogs to remove stars , spurious detections , poor measurements , and various other effects that significantly biased shear estimates for both catalogs .",
    "we use the des sv red - sequence matched - filter galaxy catalog ( rozo et al . , in preparation ) v6.3.3 in this paper as one of the foreground samples .",
    "the objects in this catalog are photometrically selected luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) .",
    "we use the terms  galaxies and lrg interchangeably .",
    "specifically ,  uses the redmapper - calibrated model for the color of red - sequence galaxies as a function of magnitude and redshift @xcite .",
    "this model is used to find the best - fit photometric redshift for all galaxies irrespective of type , and the @xmath85 goodness - of - fit of the model is computed . for each redshift slice , all galaxies fainter than some minimum luminosity threshold @xmath86 are rejected .",
    "in addition ,  applies a @xmath85 selection @xmath87 , where the @xmath88 as a function of redshift is chosen to ensure that the resulting galaxy sample has a nearly constant space density @xmath89 . in this work ,",
    "we set @xmath90 .",
    "we assume flat @xmath3 cdm model with cosmological parameters @xmath68 , @xmath91 ( varying these parameters does not change the results significantly ) .",
    "the luminosity selection is @xmath92 , where the value of @xmath93 at @xmath1=0.1 is set to match the redmapper definition for sdss , and the redshift evolution for @xmath93 is that predicted using a simple passive evolution starburst model at @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "we use the  sample because of the exquisite photometric redshifts of the  galaxy catalog :  photometric redshifts are nearly unbiased , with a scatter @xmath95 , and a @xmath96 @xmath97 redshift outlier rate .",
    "we refer the reader to rozo et al .",
    "( in preparation ) for further details of this catalog .",
    "as described in , the main goal of this paper is to construct a projected mass map at a given redshift via weak lensing and to show that the mass map corresponds to real structures , or mass , in the foreground line - of - sight . for that purpose",
    ", we define two galaxy samples in this study  the background `` source '' sample which is lensed by foreground mass , and the foreground `` lens '' sample that traces the foreground mass responsible for the lensing .",
    "we wish to construct a weak lensing mass map from the background sample according to and compare it with the mass map generated from the foreground galaxy density map according to .",
    "we choose to have the two samples separated at redshift @xmath98 in order to have a sufficient number of galaxies in both samples .",
    "given that the photo-@xmath1 training sample of our photo-@xmath1 catalog does not extend to the same redshift and magnitude range as our data , we exclude objects with photo-@xmath1 outside the range 0.11.2 .",
    "the final foreground and background sample are separated by the photo-@xmath1 selection of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "note that the   foreground galaxy sample has an additional redshift threshold @xmath101 .",
    "the main quantity of interest for the background galaxy sample is the shear measured for each galaxy . since the background sample only serves as a `` backlight '' for the foreground structure we are interested in , it need not be complete .",
    "therefore the most important selection criteria for the background sample is to use galaxies with accurate shear measurements .",
    "our source selection criteria are based on extensive tests of shear catalog as described in jarvis et al .",
    "( in preparation ) . after applying the conservative selection of background galaxies and our background redshift selection",
    "we are left with 1,111,487 galaxies ( 2.22/arcmin@xmath0 ) for ` ngmix ` and 1,013,317 galaxies ( 2.03/arcmin@xmath0 ) for ` im3shape ` .",
    "estimates for the background and foreground samples used in this paper are shown in the top panel , overlaid by the lensing efficiency ( ) corresponding to the background sample .",
    "the background and the foreground main sample uses the mean of the pdf from bpz for single - point estimates , while the lrg redshift estimate comes independently from  ( see ) .",
    "the bottom panel shows the corresponding @xmath102 of the background and foreground main sample given by bpz .",
    "these come from the sum of the pdf for all galaxies in the samples . ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : sys_maps ]            we identify several possible sources of systematics for the background and foreground sample as listed in .",
    "we generate maps of these quantities that are pixelated and smoothed on the same scale as the @xmath103 and @xmath104 maps .",
    "we then evaluate the contribution of these effects to the correlation coefficient ( ) based on the following diagnostic quantity : @xmath105 with @xmath106 being the cross - correlation function , which is effectively the unnormalized pearson correlation coefficient between @xmath107 and @xmath73 , or @xmath108 equation [ eq : sys_pearson ] measures the contribution from some systematics field @xmath109 to @xmath110 .",
    "we calculate @xmath111 with @xmath109 being any of the 20 quantities in ( excluding the signal ) .",
    "shows the normalized cross - correlation coefficient @xmath112 values for all the quantities considered for 10 and 20 arcmin smoothing , with the red dashed line at 5% .",
    "the error bars are estimated by jackknife resampling similar to that described in , and the two panels show the results for ` ngmix ` and ` im3shape ` respectively .",
    "the normalized cross - correlation coefficient is a measure of the fractional contamination in the pearson coefficient ( ) from each of the systematics maps @xmath109 .",
    "we find that for ` ngmix ` all quantities show contributions to the systematic uncertainties at 10 arcmin smoothing to be at the level of 5% or lower , while the systematics increase to up to 15% when smoothing at the 20 arcmin scale ( though with large error bars on the systematics estimation ) .",
    "for ` im3shape ` , most of the values stay below 5% for both smoothing scales .",
    "the largest contribution in both cases come from the variation in the psf properties ( psf_e1 , psf_e2 , psf_kb ) .",
    "this is expected , as the modelling of the psf is known to be a significant challenge in weak lensing . since all these psf quantities are correlated with each other , and many other parameters ( g1 , g2 , snr , maglim ) are correlated with the psf properties , we do not expect the total systematics contamination to be a direct sum of all these parameters . instead",
    ", we discuss in how one can isolate the independent contributions of the systematics via a principal component analysis approach and correct for them .",
    "we find that the correction changes the final pearson correlation coefficient by 3.5% relative to the original @xmath113 measured in .",
    "finally , to check the level of systematic contamination in our @xmath103 map itself , we also calculate the pearson correlation coefficient ( ) between the various maps in and our @xmath103 map .",
    "note that this contamination may or may not be pronounced in since the statistics plotted there also take into account the correlation of @xmath104 with the various quantities .",
    "this test is independent of the foreground map , therefore is important for applications of the @xmath103 map that do not also use the foreground maps . shows the resulting 21 pearson correlation coefficients .",
    "we find that the signal shown in the right - most points in the plot ( @xmath114 ) is larger than all other correlations by at least a factor of @xmath803 .",
    "we also note that in both of these tests , the area of the map is not big enough to ignore the fact that some of these correlations can be intrinsically non - zero , even if there were no systematics contamination in the maps .",
    "in this work , we present a weak lensing mass map based on galaxy shape measurements in the 139 deg@xmath4 spt - e field from the dark energy survey science verification data .",
    "we have cross - correlated the mass map with maps of galaxy and cluster samples in the same dataset .",
    "we demonstrate that candidate superclusters and voids along the line of sight can be identified exploiting the tight scatter of the cluster photo-@xmath1 s .",
    "we constructed mass maps from the foreground  lrg and general magnitude - limited galaxy samples under the assumption that mass traces light .",
    "we find that the e - mode of the convergence map correlates with the galaxy based maps with high statistical significance .",
    "we repeated this analysis at various smoothing scales and compared the results to measurements from mock catalogs that reproduce the galaxy distribution and lensing shape noise properties of the data .",
    "the pearson cross - correlation coefficient is @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) at 10 arcmin smoothing and @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) at 20 arcmin smoothing for the main ( lrg ) foreground sample .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath119 @xmath120 significance at 10 arcmin smoothing and @xmath119 @xmath121 at 20 arcmin smoothing .",
    "we get comparable values from the mock catalogs , indicating that statistical uncertainties , not systematics , dominate the noise in the data .",
    "the b - mode of the mass map is consistent with noise and its correlations with the foreground maps are consistent with zero at the 1@xmath2 level .    to examine potential systematic uncertainties in the convergence map we identified 20 possible systematic tracers such as seeing , depth , psf ellipticity and photo-@xmath1 uncertainties .",
    "we show that the systematics effects are consistent with zero at the 1 or 2@xmath2 level . in appendix b",
    ", we present a simple scheme for the estimation of systematic uncertainties using principal component analysis .",
    "we discuss how these contributions can be subtracted from the mass maps if they are found to be significant .    the results from this work open several new directions of study .",
    "potential areas include the study of the relative distribution of hot gas with respect to the total mass based on x - ray or sz observations , estimation of galaxy bias , constraining cosmology using peak statistics , and finding filaments in the cosmic web .",
    "the tools that we have developed in this paper are useful both for identifying potential systematic errors and for cosmological applications .",
    "the observing seasons for the first two years of des are now complete @xcite and survey an area well over ten times that of the sv data , though shallower by about half a magnitude",
    ". the full des survey area will be @xmath122 times larger than that presented here , at roughly the same depth .",

    "this paper has gone through internal review by the des collaboration .",
    "as discussed in , we consider two factors that can affect the selection of our foreground sample  spatial variation in depth and spatial variation in seeing . if not taken care of , these effects will result in apparent spatial variation of the foreground galaxy number density that is not due to the cosmological clustering of galaxies .",
    "below we describe tests for each of these and determine a set of selection criteria based on the analysis .",
    "spatial variation in the depth of the images can cause the apparent galaxy number density to vary , as more or less galaxies survive the detection threshold .",
    "we would like to construct a foreground galaxy sample which minimizes this varying depth effect .",
    "a simple solution is to place a magnitude selection slightly shallower than the limiting magnitude in all of the areas considered , so that the sample is close to complete in that magnitude range .",
    "we find that in our area of interest , with a magnitude selection at @xmath123 , we have 97.5% of the area that is complete to this magnitude limit .",
    "we use the 10@xmath2 galaxy limiting magnitude to define depth , which is a conservative measure for the completeness , as we detect many more galaxies below 10@xmath2 .",
    "the detail methodology of estimating the limiting magnitude of the data is described in rykoff et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the 2.5% slightly shallower is not expected to yield significant change in our results .",
    "spatial variation in seeing can lead to spatial variation in apparent galaxy number density , as large seeing leads to less effective star - galaxy separation as well as higher probability of blending in crowded fields . to test this , we first select a foreground sample with @xmath123 and @xmath99 according to .",
    "then we look at the correlation between the galaxy number density in this foreground sample and the average seeing values at these locations , both calculated on a grid of 5@xmath1245 arcmin@xmath4 pixels without smoothing .",
    "shows the galaxy number density versus seeing .",
    "the black data points show the mean and standard deviation ( multiplied by 10 for easy visualisation ) of the scatter plot in 15 seeing bins .",
    "there is a small anti - correlation between these two values at the 6% level .",
    "this is at an acceptable level for us to continue the analysis without masking out the extreme high / low seeing regions .",
    "as shown in , we can use to check for any outstanding systematic contamination in our @xmath103 map and its correlation with the @xmath104 map . here",
    "we present a general treatment to correct for these systematic contaminations , similar to that used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "assume that our measured @xmath103 map is a linear combination of the true @xmath125 map and some small coefficient @xmath126 times the systematics maps @xmath127 that can potentially contaminate the @xmath103 maps ( seeing , psf ellipticity ) . that is @xmath128 where we have a total of @xmath129 systematics maps .",
    "similarly , we have the expression for the measured @xmath104 in the same way @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the linear coefficient in this case .    assuming the true maps are uncorrelated with the systematics maps , we have @xmath132 @xmath133 correlating the measured @xmath103 with a single systematics map gives @xmath134",
    "we can construct a set of systematics maps that are uncorrelated between each other , or @xmath135 , and then extract all the coefficients @xmath126 from the observables as follows : @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 and similarly for @xmath104 , we have @xmath139 to construct a set of systematics maps @xmath140 uncorrelated between each other from a set of systematics maps correlated with each other @xmath141 (  those listed in ) , we invoke the principal component analysis ( pca ) method . in this case , each of the pixelated maps , after normalizing by its scatter , @xmath141 form a data vector , and the extracted eigenvectors form a orthogonal basis set , which we can use as @xmath140 .",
    "we find that the principal component maps correspond strikingly to physical properties of the data .",
    "shows the systematics maps corresponding to @xmath103 and main sample @xmath104 extracted using this pca method , or the second terms on the right - hand - side of and .",
    "we find that the main contributions come from large - scale structures and are at a very low level compared to the original maps ( see ) .",
    "we subtract these systematics maps from the original @xmath103 and @xmath104 maps according to and .",
    "the pearson correlation coefficient changes by 3.5% relative to the original @xmath113 measured in , suggesting the contamination to the cross - correlation coefficient is not significant .",
    "it is worth noting that there are a few assumptions that go into the calculation above , which need to be accounted for when interpreting these results .",
    "first , we have assumed that the systematic maps have no correlation with the true @xmath103 and @xmath104 maps . for a large enough area , this should be true , but for small maps we can expect some correlation just by chance .",
    "hence the quantitative `` improvement '' we get in the pearson correlation coefficient must be carefully checked with simulations with larger area than used here .",
    "second , since the method is based on pca , the effectiveness of the correction depends on finding the important systematics maps that can contribute _ linearly _ to the contamination .",
    "that is , if the systematics come from a non - linear combination of the various maps (  multiplication of two maps ) , then one would not automatically correct for it without putting in this correct non - linear combination of maps in the first place ."
