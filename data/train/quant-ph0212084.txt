    "all our description of objects is represented by propositions .",
    "the use of propositions is not a matter of our choice .",
    "in contrast , it is a necessity which is behind each of our attempts to learn something new about nature and to communicate this knowledge with others . it is a necessity which we follow constantly and without any intention and it seems that there is no way to avoid it even if the phenomena to be described and to be understood are highly counterintuitive and distinct from both our everyday experience and the classical world view .",
    "one may even say that there is no need to avoid it .",
    "the reason is that the only way we are able to understand any phenomena in nature , including quantum phenomena , is exclusively through the epistemological structure of classical physics and everyday experience .",
    "bohr ( 1949 ) emphasized that  how far the [ quantum ] phenomena transcend the scope of classical physical explanation , the account of all evidence must be expressed in classical terms .",
    "the argument is simply that by the word experiment we refer to a situation where we can tell others what we have done and what we have learned and that , therefore , the account of the experimental arrangement and the result of observation must be expressed in unambiguous language with suitable application of the terminology of classical physics .  .",
    "von weizscker ( 1974 ) emphasized that the understanding of new physical theories will also be given in language : \" this verbalized language must be the language spoken by those physicists who do not know yet the theory we are telling them .",
    "the language used in order to explain a theory which we propose in mathematical form is the language which has been existed before the theory . on the other hand , it is not self - evident that this language has a clear meaning at all , because if it had a completely clear meaning probable the new theory would not be needed",
    ". thus it may happen that by applying our new formalism to experience - an application made possible by our existing language - we may tacitly or explicitly change the rules of this very language .     rigorously speaking a system is nothing else than a construct based on a complete list of propositions together with their truth values .",
    "the propositions from the list could be ( 1 )  the velocity of the object is @xmath1  or ( 2 )  the position of the object is @xmath2  and could be associated both to classical and to quantum objects . yet",
    ", there is an important difference between the two cases . from the theorems of bell ( 1964 ) and of kochen and specker ( 1967 )",
    "we know that for a quantum system one can not assert definite ( noncontextual ) truth values to all conceivable propositions simultaneously .",
    "for example , if the proposition ( 1 ) above is a definite proposition , then the proposition ( 2 ) must necessarily be completely indefinite and vice versa .",
    "the two propositions are mutually exclusive .",
    "this is a specific case of quantum complementarity .",
    "therefore , in an attempt to describe quantum phenomena we are unavoidably put in the following situation . on one hand",
    "the epistemological structure applied has to be inherited from the classical physics : the description of a quantum system has to be represented by the propositions which are used in the description of a classical system , and on the other hand , those propositions can not be assigned to a quantum system simultaneously .",
    "now , a natural question arises : how to join these two , seemingly inconsistent , requirements ?",
    "we suggest to use the concept of `` knowledge '' or `` information '' .",
    "then even in situations where we can not assert simultaneously definite truth - values to mutually exclusive propositions we can assert measures of information about their truth values .",
    "the structure of the theory including the description of the time evolution can then be expressed in terms of measures of information . to us",
    "this seems to be a change with the lowest possible `` costs '' in the epistemological structure of classical physics . and",
    "since some costs are unavoidable anyway we believe that the information - theoretical formulation of quantum physics leads to the  easiest \" understanding of the theory .    from the point of view that the information content of a quantum system",
    "is fundamentally limited we will discuss precisely the empirical significance of the terms involved in formulating quantum theory , particularly the notion of a quantum state .",
    "however we are aware of the possibility that this might not carry the same degree of intuitive appeal for everyone .",
    "it is clear that it may be matter of taste whether one accepts the suggested concepts and principles as self - evident as we do or not .",
    "if not , then one may turn the reasoning around and , following our approach in ( brukner and zeilinger , 1999 ; brukner _ et al .",
    "_ 2001 ) , argue for the validity of the statements given in the paper on the basis of known features of quantum physics .",
    "the conceptual groundwork for the ideas presented here has been prepared most notably by von bohr ( 1958 ) , weizscker ( 1958 ) and wheeler ( 1983 ) .",
    "in contrast to those other authors who look for deterministic mechanisms hidden behind the observed facts , these authors attempt to understand the structure of quantum theory as a necessity for extracting whatever meaning from the data of observations .    in recent years several different ideas were put forward suggesting that information can help us to learn more about the foundations of quantum physics .",
    "the foundations of quantum mechanics are interpreted in the light of quantum information ( fuchs , 2001 ; 2002 , caves _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001a ; 2001b ) .",
    "it was also suggested how to reduce quantum theory to few statements of physical significance by generalizing and extending classical probability theory ( hardy , 2001a ; 2001b ) . in another approach",
    "it was shown how certain elements of the structure of quantum theory emerge from looking for invariants of probabilistic observations assuming that any newly gained information shall lead to more accurate knowledge of these invariants ( summhammer , 1988 ; 1994 ; 2000 ; 2001 ) .",
    "one of the most distinct features of quantum physics with respect to classical physics is that prediction with certainty of individual outcomes is only possible for a very limited class of experiments .",
    "such a prediction is equivalent to saying that the corresponding propositions have definite truth values . for all other ( complementary ) propositions the truth values are necessarily indefinite .",
    "we suggest this to be a consequence of the feature that    _ the information content of a quantum system is finite . _    with this we mean that a quantum system can not carry enough information to provide definite answers to all questions that could be asked experimentally .",
    "then , by necessity the answer of the quantum system to some questions must contain an element of randomness .",
    "this kind of randomness must then be irreducible , that is , it can not be reduced to ",
    "hidden  properties of the system .",
    "otherwise the system would carry more information than what is available .",
    "thus , without any additional physical structure assumed , we let the irreducible randomness of an individual event and complementarity , be a consequence of the finiteness of information .",
    "how much information is available to a quantum system ?",
    "if this information is limited than it is natural to assume that if we decompose a physical system , which may be represented by numerous propositions , into its constituents , each such constituent will be described by fewer propositions . this process of subdividing a system can go further until we reach a final limit when an individual system represents the truth value to one single proposition only .",
    "it is then suggestive to replace the above statement by a more precise one ( zeilinger , 1999 ) :    _ the most elementary system represents the truth value of one proposition .",
    "_    we call this the principle of quantization of information",
    ". one may consider the above statement as a definition of what is the most elementary system .",
    "note that the truth value of a proposition can be represented by one bit of information with  true ",
    "being identified with the bit value  1  and  false  being identified with the bit value  0  .",
    "thus , the principle becomes simply :    _ the most elementary system carries 1 bit of information .",
    "we relate the notion of the most elementary system to that of the `` ur '' introduced by von weizscker .",
    "he was the first who introduced the concept of the most basic informational constituent of all objects (  ur  ) .",
    "von weizscker wrote ( 1974 ) :  it is certainly possible to decide any large alternative step by step in binary alternatives .",
    "this may tempt us to describe all objects as composite systems composed from the most simple possible objects .",
    "the simplest possible object is an object with a two - dimensional hilbert space , the ur. the word ur is introduced to have an abstract term for something which can be described by quantum theory and has a two - dimensional hilbert space , and nothing more .     , and then it hits one of the detector plates behind the stern - gerlach magnet .",
    "depending on whether the upper or the lower detector plate is hit by a particle we call the outcome  yes  and  no  , respectively.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    how much information is contained in more complex systems consisting of @xmath3 elementary systems ? it is natural to assume that the information content of a complex system is proportional to the number of elementary constituents .",
    "the principle of quantization of information is thus generalized to ( zeilinger , 1999 )    _ n elementary systems represent the truth values of n propositions , _    or equivalently ,    _ n elementary systems carry n bits . _    the finding compatible with this principle were reported ( donath and svozil , 2002 ; svozil 2002 ) .",
    "again one may consider the two statements as definitions of what is a composite system consisting of @xmath3 elementary systems .",
    "note that the principle given above does not make any statement about how the information contained in @xmath3 propositions ( @xmath3 bits ) is distributed over the @xmath3 systems .",
    "it can be represented by the @xmath3 systems individually or , alternatively , it can be represented by @xmath3 systems jointly .",
    "the latter is the feature of quantum entanglement , discussed in more detail below , for which schrdinger ( 1935 ) wrote :  if two separated bodies , each by itself known maximally , enter a situation in which they influence each other , and separate again , then there occurs regularly that which i have just called entanglement of our knowledge of the two bodies .",
    "the combined expectation - catalog consists initially of a logical sum of the individual catalogs ; during the process it develops causally in accord with known law ( there is no question whatever of measurement here ) .",
    "the knowledge remains maximal , but at its end , if the two bodies have again separated , it is not again split into a logical sum of knowledges about the individual bodies .",
    "what still remains of that may have becomes less than maximal , even very strongly so .",
    "-one notes the great difference over against the classical model theory , where of course from known initial states and with known interaction the individual end states would be exactly known . ",
    "the fundamental statements given above seem to suggest that binary ( yes - no ) alternatives are representatives of basic information units of all systems .",
    "consider the case of @xmath4-fold ( i.e. ternary , quanternany etc . )",
    "alternatives generalizing the binary ones .",
    "obviously , any @xmath5-fold alternative is decomposable into binary ones .",
    "note that such an alternative can be realized in measurement of @xmath3 elementary systems .",
    "yet , it is not obvious how to decompose or how to consider a general @xmath4-fold alternative with @xmath6 ?",
    "an interesting possibility would be to find the factorization of number @xmath4 into its prime - number factors @xmath7 and then to decompose the @xmath4-fold alternative into a sequential serial of @xmath8-fold alternatives , @xmath9-fold alternatives etc .",
    "obviously such an approach would require to extend the notion of elementary system to all prime - number dimensional systems .",
    "interestingly , as it will be shown later ( see sec .",
    "[ brot ] ) , only in these cases where the dimension of the quantum system is ( a power of ) a prime number , the total information content of the system can be defined unambiguously .",
    "this might suggest that the notion of the elementary system should indeed be extended to all prime - number dimensions .",
    "however , in this manuscript we will mainly restrict our analysis to binary decomposable alternatives .",
    "we would like to stress again that notions such as that a system  represents  the truth value of a proposition or that it  carries ",
    "one bit of information only implies a statement concerning what can be said about possible measurement results . for us",
    "a system is no more than a representative of a proposition .",
    "we consider an explicit example of an elementary system , the spin-1/2 particle , and the stern - gerlach experiment as depicted in fig .",
    "[ plates ] schematically . depending on",
    "whether the upper or the lower detector plate is hit by a particle we call the outcome  yes  and  no  respectively , where `` yes '' and `` no '' represent the truth values of the proposition for the spin to be up along a chosen direction .",
    "the upper detector plate is hit with probability @xmath10 .",
    "if it is not hit the other detector plate will be hit with probability @xmath11 .",
    "therefore we consider a binary alternative .",
    "different experimental situations are specified by the orientation @xmath12 of the magnet in the stern - gerlach apparatus as shown in fig .",
    "[ plates ] .",
    "consider an elementary system specified by the true proposition  the spin along the @xmath13-axis is up  ( or , equivalently , by the false proposition  the spin along the @xmath14-axis is up  ) .",
    "this situation is described by the probabilities @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the  yes  outcome . because a spin can carry one bit of information only , each proposition :  the spin along the direction tilted at an angle @xmath12 @xmath17 from the @xmath13-axes",
    "is up  has to be probabilistic ( fig .",
    "[ kontinum ] ) . how does the probability @xmath18 of a  yes ",
    "count depend upon the angle @xmath12 ?",
    "we assume that the mapping of @xmath12 to @xmath18 is analytic would only be sectionally analytic in @xmath12 then there would be points of nonanalyticity separating two regions in which the function @xmath18 has different analytic forms .",
    "thus the values of the function on a finite segment in the interior of a domain of analyticity would only determine , by the uniqueness theorem for analytic functions , the function up to the next point of nonanalyticity .",
    "clearly , to describe such a system completely we would need catalogs both of functional values on finite segments in the interior of each domain of analyticity and of the positions of the points of nonanalyticity .",
    "such a catalog would require large amount of information to describe the functional dependence and thus contradicts our desideratum of minimal information content of a quantum system . ] and",
    "monotonic . then using the cauchy theorem about continuous and monotonic functions",
    "one concludes that there has to be one and only one angle of orientation of the magnet in the stern - gerlach apparatus where the probabilities for a  yes  and for a  no  outcome are equal . because of the symmetry of the problem this obviously has to be the angle @xmath19 .",
    "for each direction @xmath20 in the @xmath2-@xmath21 plane ( the green circle on the sphere in fig .",
    "[ kontinum ] and [ spin ] ) the proposition  the spin along the @xmath20-axis is up  is completely indefinite , that is , we have absolutely no knowledge which outcome  yes  or  no  will be observed in a specific individual measurement .     of a  yes  ( ",
    "spin up  ) count with a gradual change of the orientation @xmath12 of the magnet in the stern - gerlach apparatus .",
    "the measurement along the z - axis gives the result  yes  with certainty . because of the symmetry of the problem the probabilities for a  yes  and for a  no  count in a measurement along any direction in the @xmath2-@xmath21 plane ( the green circle ) are equal ( = 1/2 ) .",
    "how does the probability @xmath18 of a  yes ",
    "count depend on @xmath12 explicitly?,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    note , however , that in principle this equal number of yes - no outcomes could also be achieved by an ensemble of systems each giving a definite result for each direction such that the same number of  yes  or  no  results is obtained . yet again",
    "this would imply that an individual system carries enough information to permit assignment of definite truth values to all possible propositions , in contradiction to our basic principle .",
    "consider now the state of a spin-1/2 particle specified by the proposition  the spin along the @xmath2-axis is up ( down )  . in this case",
    "we have complete knowledge which outcome will be observed when the stern - gerlach magnet is oriented along the @xmath22-axis at the expense of the fact that we have absolutely no knowledge about the outcome for the orientation of the magnet along _ any direction in the @xmath21-@xmath13 plane ( the yellow circle on the sphere in fig .",
    "[ spin ] ) .",
    "_    finally , consider the state of a spin-1/2 particle specified by the proposition  the spin along the @xmath21-axis is up ( down )  . in that case",
    "we know precisely the outcome of the experiment when the stern - gerlach magnet is oriented along the @xmath23-axis at the expense of complete uncertainty about the outcome when it is oriented along any direction in the @xmath24 plane ( the red circle on the sphere in fig .",
    "[ spin ] ) .",
    "there are , therefore , altogether _ three mutually exclusive _ or _ complementary _ propositions ( represented by three intersection points of the green , yellow and red circle on the sphere in fig . [ spin ] ) :  the spin along direction @xmath25 is up ( down ) ",
    ",  the spin along direction @xmath26 is up ( down )  and  the spin along direction @xmath27 is up ( down ) ",
    ", where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are mutually orthogonal directions .",
    "these are propositions with a property of mutually exclusiveness : the total knowledge of one proposition is only possible at the cost of total ignorance about the other two complementary ones . in other words precise knowledge of the outcome of one experiment",
    "implies that all possible outcomes of complementary ones are equally probable .",
    "why are there exactly 3 mutually complementary propositions for the elementary system and not , e.g. , 2 or 4 ?",
    "we do not understand that fully .",
    "however the discussion above indicates that there is a strong link between the number ( 3 ) of mutually complementary propositions and the ( three-)dimensionality of the ordinary space .",
    "we will come back once more to these question in the conclusions .",
    "but it is important to note that in any system with dichotomic ( 2-valued ) observables there are always three complementary propositions even if these can not be linked to the dimensionality of ordinary space .",
    "consider a probabilistic experiment with @xmath4 possible outcomes .",
    "suppose that the experimenter plans to perform @xmath3 trials of the experiment .",
    "all he knows before the trials are performed are the probabilities @xmath28 for all possible outcomes to occur : what kind of prediction can the experimenter make ?    in general two cases are conceivable",
    ". the experimenter can ask : `` what is the precise sequence of the @xmath3 outcomes ? '' or `` what is the number of occurrences of the outcome @xmath29 ? '' .",
    "we will say that in answering the first question the experimenter makes a `` deterministic '' prediction and in answering the second one he makes a `` probabilistic '' prediction trials of a probabilistic yes - no experiment , like tossing a coin , in which the outcome `` yes '' occurs @xmath30 times . if we want to tell somebody else the result it is sufficient to state the values of @xmath3 and of @xmath30 . with the deterministic view ,",
    "in which the precise sequence of outcomes is important , we would in general have to communicate many more details to enable the receiver to reconstruct this sequence . ]",
    "( following discussion in summhammer , 2000 ) .",
    "obviously the deterministic prediction can only make sense if different outcomes follow from the intrinsically different individuals of the ensemble measured - the situation which we have in classical measurements .",
    "then the precise sequence of outcomes reveal which property which individual member of the ensemble carries .",
    "one can show that for sufficiently large @xmath3 shannon s measure of information ( shannon , 1948 ) @xmath31 is equal to the mean minimal number of yes - no questions ( when the logarithm in eq .",
    "( [ mrgod ] ) is taken to base 2 ) necessary to determine which particular sequence of outcomes occurs , divided by @xmath3 . as we show in more detail elsewhere",
    "( brukner and zeilinger , 2001 ) this suggests that shannon s measure of information is the adequate measure of the uncertainty in the deterministic prediction and and thus in classical measurements .",
    "-axis ( @xmath2-axis ) [ @xmath21-axis ] gives a definite result , measurement along any direction in the @xmath2-@xmath21 plane , the green circle ( @xmath21-@xmath13 plane , the yellow circle ) or [ @xmath2-@xmath13 plane , the red circle ] will be maximally random , respectively .",
    "there are altogether three mutually complementary spin measurements represented by three intersection points of the green , yellow , and red circle.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in contrast to classical measurements , quantum measurements , in general , can not be claimed to reveal a property of the individual quantum system existing before the measurement is performed .",
    "this causes certain conceptual difficulties when we try to define the information gain in quantum measurements using the notion of shannon s measure ( for discussion of these points see brukner and zeilinger , 2001 ; hall , 2000 ; brukner and zeilinger 2000 ; timpson 2001 ) .",
    "since outcomes of quantum - mechanical experiments are in general intrinsically probabilistic , there the experimenter can only make probabilistic predictions . if the experimenter decides to perform @xmath3 future experimental trails ,",
    "all he can guess is the number of occurrences of a specific outcome .",
    "such a prediction will now be analyzed for the case of two possible outcomes `` yes '' and `` no '' .",
    "because of the statistical fluctuations associated with any finite number of experimental trials , the number @xmath30 of occurrences of the `` yes '' outcome in future repetitions of the experiment is not precisely predictable is not a particular weakness of the objective empirical use of the concept of probability , but a feature of the objective empirical use of any quantitative concept . if you predict that some physical quantity , say a temperature , will have a certain value when measured , this prediction also means its expectation value within a statistical ensemble of measurements .",
    "the same statement applies to the empirical quantity called relative frequency . but here are two differences which are connected to each other . the first difference : in other empirical quantities the dispersion of the distribution is in most cases an independent empirical property of the distribution and can be al.tered by more precise measurements of other devices ; in probability the dispersion is derived from the theory itself and depends on the absolute number of cases .",
    "the second difference : in other empirical quantities the discussion of their statistical distributions is done by another theory than the one to which they individually belong , namely by the general theory of probability ; in probability this discussion evidently belongs to the theory of this quantity , namely of probability itself .",
    "the second difference explains the first one .",
    "the random variable @xmath30 is subject to a binomial distribution .",
    "since it has a finite @xmath32 deviation , it fulfills chebyshev s inequality ( gnedenko , 1976 ) : @xmath33 where the standard deviation @xmath32 is given by @xmath34 this inequality means that the probability that the number @xmath30 will deviate from the product @xmath35 by more often than @xmath36 deviations is less than or equal to @xmath37 . in the case of small @xmath32 , large deviations of the number of occurrences of the  yes  outcome from the mean value @xmath35 are improbable . in this case",
    "the experimenter knows the future number of occurrences with a high certainty .",
    "conversely , a large @xmath32 indicates that not all highly probable values of @xmath30 lie near the mean @xmath35 . in that case",
    "the experimenter knows much less about the future number of occurrences .",
    "we suggest to identify the experimenter s uncertainty @xmath38 with @xmath39",
    ". then it will be proportional to the number of trials .",
    "this important property guarantees that each individual performance of the experiment contributes the same amount of information , no matter how many times the experiment has already been performed .",
    "after each trial the experimenter s uncertainty about the specific outcome therefore decreases by @xmath40 this is the lack of information about a specific outcome with respect to a single future experimental trial .",
    "if , instead of two outcomes , we have @xmath4 of them with the probabilities @xmath41 for the individual occurrences , then we suggest to define the total lack of information regarding all @xmath4 possible experimental outcomes as @xmath42 the uncertainty is minimal if one probability is equal to one and it is maximal if all probabilities are equal .",
    "this suggests that the knowledge , or information , with respect to a single future experimental trial an experimentalist possesses before the experiment is performed is somehow the complement of @xmath43 and , furthermore , that it is a function of a sum of the squares of probabilities .",
    "a first ansatz therefore would be @xmath44 .",
    "expressions of such a general type were studied in detail by hardy , littlewood and plya ( 1952 ) . notice that this expression can also be viewed as describing the length of the probability vector @xmath45 . obviously ,",
    "because of @xmath46 , not all vectors in probability space are possible .",
    "indeed , the minimum length of @xmath45 is given when all @xmath47 are equal ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "this corresponds to the situation of complete lack of information in an experiment about its future outcome .",
    "therefore we suggest to normalize the measure of information in an individual quantum measurement as obtaining finally @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the normalization bits of information can be encoded , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "the normalization there is @xmath52 .",
    "then @xmath53 results in @xmath36 bits of information if one @xmath54 and it results in 0 bits of information when all @xmath47 are equal . ] .",
    "specifically , for a binary experiment the measure of information is given as @xmath55 it reaches its maximal value of 1 bit of information if one of the probabilities is one and it takes its minimal value of 0 bits of information if both probabilities are equal .",
    "consider again a stationary experimental arrangement with two detectors , where only one detector fires in each experimental trial .",
    "the first detector , say , fires ( we call this the  yes  outcome ) with probability @xmath8 .",
    "if it is does not fire the other detector fires with probability @xmath56 ( the  no  outcome ) .",
    "note that the experimenter s measure of information for the binary experiment as defined by eq .",
    "( [ sunka ] ) is invariant under permutation of the set of possible outcomes . in other words , it is a symmetrical function of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "a permutation of the set of possible outcomes can be achieved in two manners , which may be called  active  and  passive  . in the passive point of view",
    "the permutation is obtained by a simple relabelling of the possible outcomes and the property of invariance is self evident because relabelling obviously does not make an experiment more predictable .     which specifies the orientations of the stern - gerlach magnets in the three experiments .",
    "the three experimental arrangements are associated to the mutually complementary propositions : @xmath57 :  the spin along the @xmath2-axis is up ",
    ", @xmath58 :  the spin is up along the direction tilted at angle @xmath12 from the @xmath13-axes  and @xmath59 :  the spin is up along the direction tilted at angle @xmath60 from the @xmath13-axes.,scaledwidth=36.0% ]    from the active point of view , one retains the same labeling , and the permutation of the set of outcomes refers to a real change of the experimental set - up . for a spin measurement this would be a re - orientation of the stern - gerlach magnet . in that case the property of invariance states that the measure of information is indifferent under certain real physical changes of the experimental situation .",
    "this requirement is more stringent and may be precisely formulated as an invariance of the measure of information under interchange of the following two physical situations : ( a ) the probability for  yes  is @xmath8 and for  no  is @xmath9 ; and ( b ) the probability for  yes  is @xmath9 and for  no  is @xmath8 . yet",
    "these are different experimental situations .    in order to remove this ambiguity in the description of the experiment one can assign probabilities for occurrences or different numbers or other distinct labels to possible outcomes ,",
    "the particular scheme is of no further relevance .",
    "for example , one can use the statement \" the probability for the outcome yes is 0.6 , and for the outcome no is 0.4  , or the statement  the probability for the outcome yes is 0.4 , and for the outcome no is 0.6  to distinguish between the situations ( a ) and ( b ) given above . note that in both cases the measure of information as defined by ( [ sunka ] ) is @xmath61 .    here",
    "we will use a particular description which is based on the quantity @xmath62 then , on one hand , the sign of @xmath29 differs between the two situations in ( a ) and ( b ) , and on the other hand , the square of @xmath29 is equal to the measure of information @xmath63",
    ". therefore @xmath29 represents an economic and complete description of the experimental situation ( equivalent to the assignment of specific probabilities for the two results ) .",
    "our main goal in the next section will be to derive the functional dependence of probability @xmath64 ( recall @xmath65 on the value of the experimental parameter @xmath12 .",
    "we will first derive the functional dependence @xmath66 and therefrom that of @xmath64 . note that for this purpose one could not use @xmath67 instead of @xmath68 because with any value @xmath67 one can associate two physically non - equivalent situations ( a ) and ( b ) which correspond to different values of the probabilities . ]",

    "most importantly this simple information - theoretic criterion of entanglement can be shown to be equivalent to a _ necessary _ and _ sufficient _ condition ( horodeccy family , 1995 ) for a violation of a bell - type inequality for two - elementary systems .",
    "a generalization of our information - theoretic criterion for entanglement to @xmath3 elementary systems and its relation to the criteria for violation of bell s inequalities can be found in ( brukner _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 ) .",
    "any assignment of properties to an object is always a consequence of some observation . using information obtained in previous observations we wish to make predictions about the future .",
    "again our predictions might be formulated as , in general probabilistic , predictions about future properties of a system .",
    "clearly , these predictions can be verified or falsified by performing measurements and checking whether the experimental results agree with our predictions .",
    "it is then important to connect past observations with future observations . or , more precisely , to make , based on past observations , specific statements about possible results of future observations .    in quantum mechanics",
    "this connection between past observation and future observation exactly is achieved by the quantum - mechanical liouville equation ( for pure states it reduces to the schrdinger equation ) @xmath206.\\ ] ]    the initial state @xmath207 represents all our information as obtained by earlier observation .",
    "using the quantum - mechanical liouville equation we can derive a time evolved final state @xmath208 at some future time @xmath209 which gives us predictions for any possible observation of the system at that time . in this section",
    "the dynamics of an elementary system is formulated as a time evolution of the catalog of our knowledge of the system .",
    "this is specified by the evolution of the information vector in the space of information .",
    "the liouville equation will then be derived from the differential equation describing the motion of the information vector in the information space .",
    "we will consider now the time evolution of an elementary system with no information exchange with an environment .",
    "suppose that the state of the system at some initial time @xmath210 is represented by the catalog @xmath211 of our knowledge .",
    "now let the system evolve in time . because there is no information exchange with an environment during the evolution , the total information of the system at some later time @xmath209 must still be the same as at the initial time .",
    "this may be seen as an ultimate constant of the evolution of the system motion independent of the strength , time dependence or any other characteristic of the `` external field '' of the system .",
    "therefore @xmath212    mathematically , the conservation of the total information is equivalent to the conservation of the length of the information vector during its motion in the information space .",
    "this means that time evolution of an isolated quantum system is just a rotation of the information vector in the space of information ( see footnote [ mrkva ] ) @xmath213 where again @xmath214 is a rotation matrix @xmath215 and @xmath216 is its transposed matrix .",
    "the derivative of eq .",

    "we will now show that the operator @xmath219 is antisymmetric .",
    "we find @xmath220 where the initial time @xmath210 is identified with the time 0 .",
    "it is a well - known result of vector analysis that with every antisymmetric operator @xmath221 one may uniquely associate the  vector of rotation  @xmath222 by the relation is represented by an antisymmetric matrix @xmath223 from there we read out the components of the vector of rotation @xmath222 as @xmath224 ] @xmath225 where ",
    "@xmath226  denotes vector product . using this result we now rewrite eq .",
    "( [ lifeisover ] ) as @xmath227 mathematically , this equation describes the rotation of the information vector around the axis @xmath228 which itself changes in the course of time .",
    "physically , this is the formulation of the dynamical law for the evolution of the catalog of our knowledge",
    ".    one might recognize eq .",
    "( [ please ] ) as a description of the state evolution in terms of the bloch vector .",
    "based on the known features of the quantum formalism we will now argue for the validity of eq .",
    "( [ please ] ) .",
    "suppose that the quantum state of the system is described by the density matrix @xmath229 .",

    "note that the quantity @xmath233 for the spin along the direction @xmath234 is equal to the expectation value of spin along this direction , i.e. @xmath235 .",

    "this is only possible if the axis @xmath222 in eq .",
    "( [ please ] ) is a fixed axis in time around which the information vector rotates .",
    "this further implies the existence of a minimal interval of time the information vector needs to make one complete rotation in the space of information ( fig .",
    "[ frequency ] ) .",
    "after this time interval the values @xmath29 for all propositions about the system take the same value .",
    "this time interval is known as the debroglie wave - period .        obviously",
    "the result given above is just a very first and the simplest step toward an information - theoretical formulation of the quantum - mechanical evolution in time .",
    "mathematically , it is an immediate consequence of the ( nearly ) isomorphism between su(2 ) group of unitary rotations in a two - dimensional hilbert space and so(3 ) group of rotations in the real three - dimensional euclidian space .",
    "obviously one needs to consider more complex systems and to find position- and momentum - representations of the catalog of our knowledge in order to give an information - theoretical formulation of the schrdinger equation .",
    "in this section , it will be argued that identifying the quantum state of a system with the catalog of our knowledge of the system leads to the resolution of many of the seemingly paradoxical features of quantum mechanics connected to the so - called measurement problem .    in a quantum measurement",
    ", we find the system to be in one of the eigenstates of the observable defined by the measurement apparatus .",
    "a specific example is the case when we are considering a wave packet as being composed of a superposition of plane waves .",
    "such a wave packet is more or less well - localized , but we can always perform a position measurement on a wave packet which is better localized than the dimension of the packet itself .",
    "this , sometimes called  reduction of the wave packet  or  collapse of the wave function  , can only be seen as a  measurement paradox  if one views this change of the quantum state as a real physical process . in the extreme case",
    "it is often even related to an instant collapse of some physical wave in space .",
    "there is no basis for any such assumption .",
    "in contrast , there is never a paradox if we realize that the wave function is just an encoded mathematical representation of our knowledge of the system .",
    "when the state of a quantum system has a non - zero value at some position in space at some particular time , it does not mean that the system is physically present at that point , but only that our knowledge ( or lack of knowledge ) of the system allows the particle the _ possibility _ of being present at that point at that instant .    what can be more natural than to change the representation of our knowledge if we gain new knowledge from a measurement performed on the system ?",
    "when a measurement is performed , our knowledge of the system changes , and therefore its representation , the quantum state , also changes . in agreement with the new knowledge",
    ", it instantaneously changes all its components , even those which describe our knowledge in the regions of space quite distant from the site of the measurement .",
    "then no need whatsoever arises to allude to notions like superluminal or instantaneous transmission of information .",
    "schrdinger ( 1935 ) wrote - function ( = the prediction catalog ) a characteristic , quite sudden change , which _ depends on the measurement result obtained _ , and so _ can not be foreseen _ ; from which alone it is already quite clear that this second kind of change of the @xmath69-function has nothing whatever in common with its orderly development _ between _ two measurements . the abrupt change by measurement",
    "... is the most interesting point of the entire theory .",
    "it is precisely _ the _ point that demands the break with naive realism .",
    "for _ this _ reason one _ can not _ put the @xmath69-function directly in place of the model or of the physical thing . and indeed",
    "not because one might never dare impute abrupt unforseen changes to a physical thing or to a model , but because in the realism point of view observation is a natural process like any other and can not per se bring about an interruption of the orderly flow of natural events .  ] :  bei jeder messung ist man gentigt , der @xmath69-funktion ( = dem voraussagenkatalog ) eine eigenartige , etwas pltzliche vernderung zuzuschreiben , die von der _ gefundenen mazahl _ abhngt und sich _ nicht vorhersehen lt _ ; woraus allein schon deutlich ist , da diese zweite art von vernderung der @xmath69-funktion mit ihrem regelmssigen abrollen _ zwischen _ zwei messungen nicht das mindeste zu tun hat .",
    "die abrupte vernderung durch die messung ...",
    "ist der interessanteste punkt der ganzen theorie .",
    "es ist genau _ der _ punkt , der den bruch mit dem naiven realismus verlangt .",
    "grund kann man die @xmath69-funktion _ nicht _ direkt an die stelle des modells oder des realdings setzen .",
    "und zwar nicht etwa weil man einem realding oder einem modell nicht abrupte unvorhergesehene nderung zumuten drfte , sondern weil vom realistischen standpunkt die beobachtung ein naturvorgang ist wie jeder andere und nicht per se eine unterbrechung des regelmssigen naturlaufs hervorrufen darf  .",
    "a closely related position was assumed also by heisenberg , who wrote in a letter to renninger dated february 2 , 1960 :  the act of recording , on the other hand , which leads to the reduction of the state , is not a physical , but rather , so to say , a mathematical process . with the sudden change of our knowledge also the mathematical presentation of our knowledge undergoes of course a sudden change .  , as translated by jammer ( 1974 ) .",
    "we will now bring the role of the observer in a quantum measurement to the center of our discussion . in classical physics",
    "we can assume that an observation reveals some property already existing in the outside world .",
    "for example , if we look at the moon , we just find out where it is and it is certainly safe to assume that the property of the moon to be there is independent of whether anyone looks or not .",
    "the situation is drastically different in quantum mechanics and it is just the very attitude of the copenhagen interpretation giving a fundamental role to observation which is a major intellectual step forward over this naive classical realism . with the only exception of the system being in an eigenstate of the measured observable , a quantum measurement changes the system into one of the possible new states defined by the measurement apparatus in a fundamentally unpredictable way , and thus can not be claimed to reveal a property existing before the measurement is performed .",
    "the reason for this is again the fact that a quantum system can not , not even in principle , carry enough information to specify observation - independent properties corresponding to all possible measurements . in the measurement the state therefore must appear to be changed in accord with the new information , if any , _ acquired _ about the system together with unavoidable and irrecoverable _ loss _ of complementary information . unlike a classical measurement , a quantum measurement",
    "thus does not just add ( if any ) some knowledge , it changes our knowledge in agreement with a fundamental finiteness of the total information content of the system    we as observers have a significant role in the measurement process , because we can decide by choosing the measuring device which attribute will be realized in the actual measurement",
    ". since the information content of the system is limited , by choosing which measurement device to use we not only decide what particular knowledge will be gained , but simultaneously what complementary knowledge will be lost after the measurement is performed . here , a very subtle position was assumed by pauli ( 1955 ) who writes :  the gain of knowledge by means of an observation has as a necessary and natural consequence , the loss of some other knowledge .",
    "the observer has however the free choice , corresponding to two mutually exclusive experimental arrangements , of determining _ what _ particular knowledge is gained and what other knowledge is lost ( complementary pairs of opposites ) .",
    "therefore every irrevocable interference by an observation about a system alters its state , and creates a new phenomenon in bohr s sense . ",
    "the laws we discover about nature do not already exist as  laws of nature  in the outside world .",
    "rather  laws of nature  are necessities of the mind for any possibility to make sense whatsoever out of the data of experience .",
    "this epistemological structure is a necessity behind the form of all laws an observer can discover . as von weizscker",
    "has put it , and heisenberg quoted in ( 1958 ) paper :  nature is earlier than man , but man is earlier than natural science .     an observer is inescapably suspended in the situation of obtaining the data from observation , formatting concepts of nature therefrom , and predicting the data of future observations . in observing she /",
    "he is able to distinguish only a finite number of results at each interval of time ( compare summhammer , 2000 ; 2001 ) .",
    "therefore the experience of the ultimate experimenter is a stream of (  yes  or  no  ) answers to the questions posed to nature .",
    "any concept of an existing reality is then a mental construction based on these answers . of course",
    "this does not imply that reality is no more than a pure subjective human construct . from our observations we are able to build up objects with a set of properties that do not change under variations of modes of observation or description .",
    "these are  invariants  with respect to these variations .",
    "predictions based on any such specific invariants may then be checked by anyone , and as a result we may arrive at an intersubjective agreement about the model , thus lending a sense of independent reality to the mentally constructed objects .    in quantum experiments",
    "an observer may decide to measure a different set of complementary variables , thus gaining certainty about one or more variable at the expense of losing certainty about the other(s ) .",
    "thus the measure of information in an individual experiment is not an invariant but depends on the specific experimental context .",
    "however the total uncertainty , or equivalently , the total information , is invariant under such transformation from one complete set of complementary variables to another . in classical physics",
    "a property of a system is a primary concept prior to and independent of observation and information is a secondary concept which measures our ignorance about properties of the system .",
    "in contrast in quantum physics the notion of the total information of the system emerges as a primary concept , independent of the particular complete set of complementary experimental procedures the observer might choose , and a property becomes a secondary concept , a specific representation of the information of the system that is created spontaneously in the measurement itself .",
    "bohr ( 1934 ) wrote that  ... a subsequent measurement to a certain degree deprives the information given by a previous measurement of its significance for predicting the future course of phenomena .",
    "obviously , these facts not only set a limit to the _ extent _ of the information obtainable by measurement , but they also set a limit to the _ meaning _ which we may attribute to such information .",
    "    theorems like those of bell ( 1964 ) and greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( 1990 ) state that randomness of an individual quantum event can not be derived from local causes ( local hidden variables ) .",
    "quantum physics is not able to  explain why ( specific ) events happen  as pointed out by bell ( 1990 ) .",
    "it is beyond the scope of quantum physics to answer the question why events happen at all ( that is , why the detectors clicks at all ) . yet",
    ", if events happen , then they must happen randomly .",
    "the reason is the finiteness of the information . any detailed description of the reality that would be able to give an unambiguous answer to bell s question ,",
    "that is , any description that would be able to arrive at an accurate and detailed prediction of the particular process resulting in a particular event , will necessarily include the definition of a number of  hidden  properties of the system which would carry information as to which specific result will be observed for all possible future measurements . therefore no answer can be given to bell s question , because otherwise , quantum system would carry more information that it is in principle available .",
    "it turns out that the lowest symmetry common for all elementary systems is the invariance of their total information content with respect to a rotation in a three - dimensional space .",
    "the three dimensionality of the information space is a consequence of the minimal number ( 3 ) of mutually exclusive experimental questions we may pose to an elementary system .",
    "this seems to justify the use of three - dimensional space as  the  space of the inferred world .",
    "such a view was first suggested by v. weizscker ( 1974 ) : `` it [ quantum theory of the simple alternative ] contains a two - dimensional complex vector space with a unitary metric , a two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "this theory has a group of transformations which is surprisingly near - isomorphic with a group of rotations in the real three - dimensional euclidian space .",
    "this has been known for a very long time .",
    "i propose to take this isomorphism seriously as being the real reason why ordinary space is three - dimensional . ''",
    "we end with another quote of v. weizscker ( 1974 ) : `` but i feel these consideration make it plausible that quantum theory is not just one out of a thousand equally possible theories , and the one which happens to please god so much that he chose to create a world in which it would be true .",
    "i rather think , if we had understood quantum theory just a little bit better than we understand it so far it would turn out to be a fairly good approximation towards the formulation of a theory which contains nothing but the rules under which we speak about future events if we can speak about them in an empirically testable way at all . ''",
    "it has not escape our attention that our considerations presented here may be viewed as providing the necessary justification for this point of view .",
