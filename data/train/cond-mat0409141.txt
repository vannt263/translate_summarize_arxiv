    "one of the most striking features observed in the phase diagram of the high t@xmath5 superconducting cuprates is the proximity between the insulating state with long - range antiferromagnetic order and the superconducting phase .",
    "this remarkable issue and the fact that at optimum doping the antiferromagnetic coherence length remains finite ( @xmath6 for la@xmath7sr@xmath8cu0@xmath9 ) , have been the source of inspiration for many theoretical works in which the pairing mechanism is proposed to be originated in the fluctuations of the spin - density wave phase .",
    "another peculiarity of these materials is that the superconducting order parameter has @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "the reason for this property is also thought to be the closeness to the antiferromagnetic phase as the lines of nodes of the superconducting gap allows for the existence of gapless spin excitations and superconductivity can coexist with spin - density wave fluctuations . very recently , the proximity between these two phases supplemented with the effect of disorder has been the basic ingredient in a phenomenological model to suggest that _ colossal _ effects can be expected in the phase diagram of the cuprates @xcite .    the fact that the ground - state of the undoped materials is antiferromagnetic immediately suggests that the hubbard model could be a good candidate for a microscopic description of these compounds .",
    "instead , the explanation of the superconducting mechanism in the framework of this model remains very controversial .",
    "a superconducting solution is found when the model is tackled with some many - body techniques@xcite .",
    "however , all the numerical works devoted to search indications of superconductivity in the repulsive hubbard model have been negative so far @xcite . another candidate model to provide",
    "the basis for the theoretical investigation of the high t@xmath5 superconductors is the @xmath10 model , which coincides with the hubbard hamiltonian in the limit of @xmath11 ( corresponding to @xmath12 ) . in the case of the @xmath10 model , many - body methods and numerical results",
    "seem to be in agreement concerning the possibility of a superconducting state with @xmath2 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the range of @xmath0 at which it may occur is , however , not precisely determined and it is likely to lie beyond the region where the mapping from the hubbard model is valid .",
    "this motivates the study of the @xmath13 model @xmath14 which , in addition to the coulomb repulsion @xmath1 of the usual hubbard hamiltonian , contains a nearest - neighbor exchange interaction @xmath0 as the @xmath10 model . in such a way , we can expect to retain appealing features of both models , like the charge fluctuations introduced by @xmath1 but forbidden in the constrained @xmath10 model and the robust superconducting correlations introduced by the exchange interaction and explore the interplay between both effects . beside these heuristic arguments",
    ", the @xmath13 model is closely related to the extended hubbard model with correlated hopping , which has been derived from the three - band extended hubbard model as an effective one - band hamiltonian to describe the low energy properties of the cu - o planes of the high-@xmath15 materials @xcite .",
    "the latter model is characterized by three different nearest - neighbor hopping amplitudes @xmath16 depending on the occupation of the two sites involved , as well as the usual coulomb repulsion @xmath1 , @xmath17 \\nonumber \\\\ & & t_{bb } n_{i \\overline{\\sigma } } n_{j \\overline{\\sigma } } \\}. \\label{corhop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] each of the parameters of the above model depends on the parameters of the original three - band hamiltonian and there is a degree of uncertainty in their precise values .",
    "the relevant property is that reasonable estimates indicate that @xmath18 is larger than the other two @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the different hopping processes in ( [ corhop ] ) reveals that the one driven by @xmath18 mediates antiferromagnetic correlations . in particular , in the strong coupling limit @xmath19 ,",
    "the exchange interaction obtained by treating ( [ corhop ] ) with second order perturbation theory is @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , when this process is suppressed , antiferromagnetic correlations are completely eliminated and a metal - insulator transition can take place at finite @xmath1 in the half - filled system @xcite . for weak coupling , the hamiltonian ( [ corhop ] ) can be treated with mean - field hartree - fock and bcs - like techniques in 2d @xcite and with operator product expansion and bosonization in 1d @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , close to half - filling , the predicted phase diagram is equivalent to that obtained starting from an effective @xmath13 model @xcite . in summary ,",
    "the relevance of the @xmath13 model to describe the physics of the cuprates can be also supported by its closeness to the correlated hubbard model derived from the more detailed three - band hubbard model for the cu - o planes .",
    "coming back to the phenomenology of the superconducting cuprates , the @xmath13 model provides the framework for recent suggestions based on a combined order parameter with superconducting and bond - density - wave components with @xmath2 symmetries to explain the intriguing pseudogap phenomena @xcite .",
    "in general , extended hubbard models in low dimensions are of interest in the context of high-@xmath15 materials @xcite and also to understand the rich structure observed in the phase diagrams of organic materials like ( tmtsf)@xmath21pf@xmath22 , and ( tmtsf)@xmath21clo@xmath9 @xcite , which can not be explained on the basis the local coulomb interaction of the usual hubbard model .",
    "the @xmath13 model has an explicit effective attraction mediated by @xmath0 that enables a superconducting solution even within a simple bcs - like description .",
    "numerical studies of this model in ladders indicate that superconducting correlations with @xmath2 symmetry are enhanced in comparison to those of the usual hubbard model @xcite .",
    "more recently , an analysis based on the landau fermi liquid picture has been adopted to argue that the pairing interaction mediated by @xmath0 combined by a strong renormalization of the effective density of states caused by @xmath1 results in a significant enhancement of the superconducting order parameter while quantum monte carlo simulations based on a variational wave function with a bcs structure support this picture @xcite .",
    "investigations of the weak coupling phase diagram at van hove fillings of the two dimensional version of this model supplemented by a nearest - neighbor coulomb repulsion and next - nearest neighbor hopping amplitude have also been reported @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate the two - dimensional phase diagram of the @xmath13 model with two complementary techniques : exact diagonalization ( ed ) of a small cluster with @xmath23 sites and the one - loop renormalization group ( rg ) technique presented in refs .",
    "the latter are expected to provide reliable indications of the main instabilities of the fermi liquid in the limit of weak interactions .",
    "ed is an unbiased method that consists in the exact calculation of the ground state wave function , allowing for the direct evaluation of the relevant correlation functions but has the drawback that the size of the clusters that are amenable to be treated is small . in spite of that limitation , in the case of the @xmath10 model ,",
    "the conclusions based on numerical results on such small clusters are among the most robust ones regarding superconductivity @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to analyze the predictions of these two methods and to compare them with previous results .",
    "the article is organized as follows , in section ii we provide some technical details on the methods we employ . in particular , we describe the procedure followed to include self energy corrections in the rg treatment .",
    "an important reference is the behavior of the relevant susceptibilities evaluated with this rg procedure for the usual hubbard model .",
    "this is discussed in section iii . in sections",
    "iv and v we present the results for the @xmath13 model using rg and ed , respectively .",
    "section vi is devoted to summary and conclusions .",
    "the basic hypothesis of the renormalization group method is that the normal state is well described by the effective action for quasiparticles near the fermi surface .",
    "the description of the many body problem is done in terms of the two - body effective interaction @xmath24 and the quasiparticle weight @xmath25 . in the wilson s renormalization scheme",
    ", @xmath24 is the effective interaction between electrons _ within _ the ring @xmath26 around the fermi surface .",
    "this interaction is renormalized by the scattering processes involving all electrons _ outside _ the ring @xmath26 .",
    "a physical interpretation of the cutoff @xmath27 is that it plays the role of an effective temperature or the experimental probe frequency . in previous versions of rg @xcite ,",
    "it was assumed @xmath25=1 . in what follows",
    ", we summarize the improved rg method of ref .",
    "@xcite which also considers self - energy corrections by taking into account the renormalization of the quasiparticle weight .    an important issue to note is the fact that @xmath24 and @xmath25 depend only on the angles @xmath28 that parametrize the positions of the particles on the fermi surface .",
    "this is justified by a simple power counting which tells us that only the angular dependence of the effective interaction is marginal ( or marginally - relevant ) and only terms up to linear in energy are to be kept in the renormalization of the angle - dependent self - energy @xcite . in the renormalization group procedure , these functions are continuously renormalized as the energy cutoff , parametrized by the scale @xmath29 as @xmath30 is reduced . the ensuing equation for the evolution of @xmath31 within the one - loop renormalization group scheme has the following structure : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the exchange operator defined as @xmath34 .",

    "all coupling constants are found to diverge at the same critical scale @xmath43 like @xmath44 where the weights @xmath45 are model dependent constants .",
    "this type of solution is called the fixed - pole solution in contrast to the mobile - pole solution , where different coupling constants diverge at different critical scales . for realistic systems , where the initial coupling is not extremely small , only fixed poles are relevant @xcite .",
    "the critical scale @xmath43 depends on the bare coupling constants @xmath1 and @xmath0 and on the band filling parametrized by the chemical potential .",
    "the critical cutoff @xmath46 appears to be the characteristic temperature of the model .",
    "the most precise non - restrictive interpretation of @xmath47 is that at this energy electrons start to build bound states .",
    "namely , the poles in eq.[div ] are the two - particle propagator poles , indicating the on - set of bound states",
    ". these bound states can be of charge , spin or superconducting kind and all of them renormalize the one - particle weight .",
    "this renormalization is angle dependent and its evolution is described by the following expression @xmath48 with the initial condition @xmath49 .",
    "the function @xmath50 is the angle dependent density of states at the energy @xmath51 ( measured from the fermi level ) . the quantity @xmath52 contains particle - particle ( pp ) and particle - hole ( ph ) contributions @xmath53 with all terms on the right - hand side taken with external legs @xmath54 .",

    "for this reason we have to follow the renormalization of several angle - resolved correlation functions .",
    "the superconducting correlation function @xmath58 measures correlations between the cooper pairs @xmath59 and @xmath60 , all states being at the fermi surface .",

    "the meaning of @xmath72 is that @xmath73 so that the initial conditions for @xmath74 and for @xmath75 are the same : @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the dirac function .",
    "initial conditions for susceptibilities are : @xmath78 after discretization we integrate numerically equations ( [ flow_chi ] ) and ( [ flow_z ] ) .",
    "the relevant susceptibility in each channel is the dominant eigenvalue of the angle - resolved correlation function .",
    "the corresponding eigenvector determines the angular dependence of the order parameter .",
    "this method consists in the exact computation , by recourse to lanczos algorithm , of the ground state ( gs ) wave function of the model hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) on a small cluster .",

    "= 3.5 in    due to the finite size of the cluster , its reciprocal lattice contains just some few ( @xmath80 ) points .",
    "as several instabilities are expected to be competitive in this model , the rough mesh of available @xmath81-vectors can produce an important bias and lead to an artificial enhancement of some kind of correlation .",
    "the only resort to minimize this drawback is to consider different kinds of boundary conditions , which is equivalent to consider different choices of the 16 @xmath81-points .",
    "an arbitrary choice of boundary conditions breaks the point group symmetry of the original lattice .",
    "exceptions are the periodic ( p ) and antiperiodic ( ap ) boundary conditions , which lead to the mesh indicated in figs.[fig2]b and c , respectively .",

    "for some densities of particles this condition is , however , not possible to be fulfilled for any choice of the boundary conditions and the gs is degenerate .",
    "the interactions normally lift most of the degeneracies . in some cases",
    ", it is observed that when the interactions overcome some particular value , a change is produced in the bc leading to the lowest energy .",
    "the latter effect is an indication that interactions lead to some qualitative change in the behavior of the gs .",
    "this is , of course , a mere finite size effect but provides a valuable information , since it reflects that the system prefers a change in the population of available @xmath81-points in order to take advantage of the interactions and thus lower the energy .    to investigate the superconducting correlations in the gs",
    "it is useful to study the behavior of the pair correlation function ( pcf ) @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the ground - state wave function while @xmath87 for on - site @xmath88 pairing , @xmath89/\\sqrt{8}$ ] , with @xmath90 for extended @xmath88 pairing , and @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) when @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) for @xmath95 pairing .",

    "the pcf can be finite , we interpret an enhancement of the corresponding pcf _ relative to its value at @xmath100 _ as an indication of the superconducting instability .    to study the spin - density - wave ( sdw ) correlations it is useful to compute the spin - spin correlation function , @xmath101 and to analyze the fourier transform @xmath102 which provides information on the nature of the correlations between spins .",
    "in this section we present results for the usual hubbard model obtained by the rg method described in the previous section .",
    "the motivation is twofold . for the case of the @xmath4 model",

    "@xcite that self - energy corrections included in the renornalization of @xmath103 are important to predict the antiferromagnetic instability at half - filling in 2d and to recover the correct expression for the jump at the fermi points in 1d but the behavior of the susceptibilities away from half - filling has not been analyzed so far . on another hand , for @xmath104 the model is a paradigmatic example of a superconductor and it is , therefore , an important reference point to analyze the behavior of the superconducting correlations . the results shown correspond to a discretization of 32 patches .",
    "= 3.5 in    when applied to the usual hubbard model with repulsive interactions ( @xmath4 ) , the rg without considering self - energy corrections @xcite , predicts that at some critical scale @xmath43 , the superconducting susceptibility with @xmath2 symmetry together with af susceptibility diverge within the parquet regime ( @xmath105 ) , even at half - filling .",
    "this feature is expected to be an artifact of the approximation since for @xmath106 umklapp processes are active and they are expected to drive the system toward an insulating af state . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that , due to the renormalization of the quasiparticle weight , the sc susceptibility is suppressed below its noninteracting value , while the af susceptibility remains enhanced , although weakly , relative to the noninteracting particle - hole one .",

    "@xcite . without self - energy corrections",
    "both sc and af susceptibilities diverge at @xmath43 , af being dominant .",
    "self - energy effects suppress the divergence , decreasing the sc susceptibility bellow its noninteracting value .",
    "the af susceptibility is also renormalized by self - energy effects but remains larger than the noninteracting one . the scale @xmath109 ( see fig . [ posu ] ) at which the af susceptibility begins to depart from the behavior of the noninteracting one is , however , not affected by the self - energy corrections .",
    "this kind of behavior extends along the parquet regime , defined by the condition @xmath105 .",
    "the region at lower densities such that @xmath110 is usually called bcs regime because only cooper channel has logarithmic contributions to the effective interaction .",
    "the two right - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ posu ] show how in this regime both af and sc susceptibilities remain slightly larger than their noninteracting values when self - energy corrections are taken into account .",
    "these results need some discussion . up to now",
    "it was rather widely accepted that the 2d hubbard model has a @xmath2 sc state away from half - filling . on the contrary results on the right - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ posu ] do not convincingly indicate a strong superconducting instability .",
    "the sc correlation functions being only weakly enhanced and the scale @xmath109 being strongly renormalized towards high values when self - energy effects are taken into account ( see right - hand lower panel of fig .",
    "[ posu ] ) .",
    "this indicates that the energy @xmath111 at which superconducting correlations begin to manifest themselves decreases when self - energy effects are considered . at @xmath112",
    "there is a creation of bound states because the 4-points vertex ( [ div ] ) has poles .",
    "these bound states are the gapless modes that destroy the one - particle coherence via self - energy corrections and the result is that the phase transition is suppressed , probably to some finite lower energy .",
    "= 3.5 in    to justify the above interpretation we calculated for comparison the rg flow of the attractive hubbard model , for which the instabilities are better known .",
    "the @xmath104 model is a paradigmatic example of @xmath88-wave type superconductor and its phase diagram has been investigated in detail by mean - field and numerical techniques . unlike the repulsive counterpart , predictions by different methods agree about the main instabilities expected in its phase diagram @xcite : at weak coupling , the explicit local negative interaction leads to bcs - like superconductivity away from half - filling . for @xmath106 , local cdw",
    "is believed to be degenerate with @xmath88-wave superconductivity in the gs @xcite . in 1d ,",
    "such degeneracy is exact due to symmetry reasons .",
    "this is because the repulsive model has dominant af correlations with a power law decay .",
    "since no breaking of the su(2 ) symmetry is possible , the behavior of the correlations in any of the spacial direction must behave in the same way . on another hand",
    ", there is an exact transformation @xmath113 , @xmath114 , which maps the repulsive model into the attractive one , while maps the degenerate @xmath115 and @xmath116 components of the dominant sdw correlations of the @xmath4 model to the cdw and superconducting ones , respectively , of the @xmath104 counterpart .",
    "the above reasoning can also be extended to the 2d case provided that no symmetry breaking in the ground state of the @xmath4 model takes place .",
    "results obtained with rg for the attractive model in 2d shown in fig [ negu ] are in very good agreement with the description provided by numerical methods @xcite . at half - filling ( @xmath108 ,",
    "see left - hand panels of fig .",
    "[ negu ] ) , the most remarkable feature is the degeneracy observed between cdw and sc susceptibility with local @xmath88-wave symmetry , which remain slightly larger than the noninteracting one when self - energy corrections are considered .",
    "this should be rather expected since the present method provides a description of the normal state and only the on - set of the instability towards the symmetry broken state is captured .",

    "middle and right - hand panels of fig [ negu ] ) , cdw susceptibility becomes weaker , approximately equal to the noninteracting one , while the superconducting susceptibility becomes more enhanced .",
    "self - energy effects suppress the divergence of the different instabilities but do not renormalize the scale @xmath109 .",
    "bellow half - filling , the @xmath88-wave type sc susceptibility is clearly larger than the noninteracting particle - particle one . as expected , the cdw remains non renormalized .",
    "compared to the repulsive hubbard model ( fig.[posu ] ) , the enhancement of sc correlations is more convincing and in the present case we can indeed assign the divergence at @xmath43 to the on - set of the @xmath88-wave superconductivity .",
    "altogether , the attractive hubbard model away from half - filling shows strong tendencies towards the @xmath88-wave superconductivity even when the self - energy corrections are taken into account .",
    "this is in contrast to the repulsive case where the self - energy effects have a more pronounced effect against the @xmath2 superconductivity .",
    "the reason for this behavior is rather simple : the @xmath88-wave superconductivity in the attractive hubbard model is an effect of first order in @xmath1 , while the self - energy corrections are of second order .",
    "as long as the coupling is weak the bcs like instability is a good approximation .",
    "formally this means that the mean - field and the kosterlitz - thouless transitions are close to one another . in the case of the repulsive interaction the @xmath2 superconductivity and the self - energy corrections",
    "are both of second order in @xmath1 , so that by decreasing @xmath1 one can not promote only superconductivity and make the fluctuations subdominant .",
    "we present results for the relevant susceptibilities in the @xmath13 model in fig .",
    "[ figuj ] .",
    "the left - hand panels correspond to half - filling and the behavior is similar to that of the hubbard case .",
    "namely , sc susceptibility with @xmath2 symmetry evolves to values below of the noninteracting one , while af susceptibility remains higher than its noninteracting value , indicating that at @xmath106 , the system flows towards an af insulating state . upon doping the @xmath2 superconductivity gets progressively stronger and becomes the dominant instability at about the crossover line @xmath118 , just as in the hubbard model .",
    "the right - hand panels show a typical flow of the susceptibility in the bcs regime ( @xmath119 ) where the dominant correlations are of superconductivity type .",
    "the above picture shares some features with the behavior observed in the hubbard model , discussed in the previous section .",
    "important issues to highlight are : ( i ) at half - filling the behavior of the relevant susceptibilities is very similar to that of the repulsive hubbard model .",
    "however , the scale @xmath43 at which the on - set of the af instability takes place as well as the scale @xmath109 are smaller than for the @xmath3 case .",
    "the susceptibility is also significantly larger than the noninteracting one , even when self - energy corrections are included in the rg procedure .",
    "these features indicate that @xmath0 contributes to increase the af correlations and the neel temperature .",
    "( ii ) at higher dopings , within the bcs regime , af susceptibility coincides with the noninteracting one while sc correlations become significantly enhanced .",
    "this is in contrast to the behavior of the repulsive model ( cf .",
    "[ posu ] ) where sc correlations are only weakly enhanced . instead , the behavior on the right panels of fig .",
    "[ figuj ] resembles the one of the attractive hubbard model , if we associate @xmath2 sc and af susceptibilities in fig .",
    "[ figuj ] respectively to @xmath88-wave sc and cdw susceptibilities on middle and right panels of fig .",
    "[ negu ] . also note that , as in the attractive model , the scale @xmath109 remains unaffected by self - energy effects .",
    "in addition , the scale @xmath43 at which the on - set of the superconducting instability is observed is small in the @xmath13 model , implying a high critical temperature .",

    "we have verified the reliability of these results upon increasing number of patches up to 64 patches .",
    "the reason for the robustness of the sc correlations is in the fact that the @xmath0 interaction has an attractive @xmath2 sc component , so that superconductivity exists already at first order of @xmath31 while the fluctuations are only subdominant , just as in the attractive hubbard case .    in order to have a more quantitative representation of the role played by both interactions we present the phase diagram in fig .",
    "the `` critical temperature '' plotted in the figure is defined as @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",

    "the arrows are drawn to ease the reading ) , it is clear that @xmath0 is a remarkably efficient mechanism to drive af close to half - filling and @xmath2 superconductivity in the doped system .",
    "another important feature is that at fixed @xmath0 , the effect of @xmath1 is to increase the `` critical temperature '' .",
    "this means that the two interactions are not competitive but , instead , cooperate to increase the strength of antiferromagnetic and superconducting correlations .",
    "the results of the previous section suggest that the combined effect of the interactions @xmath0 and @xmath1 drives superconductivity with @xmath2 symmetry in the doped system , leading to a significant enhancement of the superconducting correlations . as in the case of the pure hubbard model",

    "we have first considered the repulsive and the attractive hubbard models and we have calculated the self - energy - dressed dominant correlation functions at half - filling and at finite doping . in the repulsive ( @xmath150 ) case",

    "this behavior , discussed in ref.@xcite , is a signature of the mott localization tendencies with simultaneous build - up of short ranged af correlations . at finite doping ,",
    "surprisingly and contrary to previous predictions made by the rg theory without self - energy corrections ( ref.@xcite ) , the superconducting instabilities are strongly reduced by self - energy corrections even deeply in the bcs regime , i.e. when the fermi surface is badly nested and umklapps are irrelevant . in the case of the attractive interaction ( @xmath152 )",
    "our rg results are in complete agreement with previous studies @xcite . at half - filling the @xmath88-wave superconductivity and",
    "the charge density wave correlations are degenerate .",
    "the flow of the two correlation functions looks similar to the one of the af correlation function for repulsive hubbard model at half - filling . just as in the repulsive case , the self - energy effect regularizes the flow of correlation functions near @xmath112 at half - filling and no phase transition occurs at this scale .",
    "the effective action of the regime below @xmath112 was discussed by schulz @xcite .",
    "contrary to the half - filled case , at finite doping the attractive hubbard model shows a convincing on - set of the superconductivity . in comparison to the repulsive case",
    "where @xmath2 sc susceptibility is only weakly enhanced , in the attractive case the @xmath88-wave sc correlations at @xmath112 are not destroyed by the self - energy , while cdw susceptibility remains stuck to its @xmath151 value . at this point",
    "some general remarks are in order .",
    "we have seen that there are fundamental differences between rg flows of the repulsive and of the attractive hubbard models .",
    "the fluctuations in the repulsive model are much stronger and probably fatal for superconductivity .",
    "they tend not only to decrease the magnitude of the sc susceptibility but also to decrease the energy @xmath153 at which it begins to depart from the behavior of the noninteracting one .",
    "our present study is unable to say if the superconductivity is stabilized or not at some energy lower than @xmath112 .",
    "however , the absence of all divergences indicates that the scenarios with pre - formed pairs of af and sc type are relevant even in the weak coupling limit .",
    "these rg results agree with the ed analysis for the intermediate - to - strong couplings , where no superconductivity was detected .",
    "the situation is fundamentally different in the attractive hubbard model , where the superconducting instability is robust upon self - energy corrections .",
    "this is the rg version of the well known fact that the incoherent preformed pairs can live only at intermediate - to - strong interaction @xcite .",
    "the study of the two hubbard models was a necessary introduction to the rg analysis of the @xmath13 model .",
    "the question that we answer is if the superconductivity of the @xmath13 model is enhanced or reduced with respect to the simple cases @xmath3 and @xmath151 .",
    "the answer is that @xmath0 and @xmath1 cooperate to a ) increase the critical cutoff b ) keeping the renornalized susceptibility enhanced relative to the noninteracting one .",
    "we also found that the latter effect is observed not only on the superconducting side of the phase diagram but also on the antiferromagnetic one .",
    "we thus have an evidence for the _ u - j synergy effect_. the phase diagram on fig .",
    "[ pduj ] shows in particular the cases ( @xmath154 ) , ( @xmath155 ) and ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "the critical temperature of the third case is much higher than for the first two , while the onset of @xmath2 sc remains convincingly large in the flow of the correlation function .",
    "exact - diagonalization results support the above picture .",
    "in fact , for large enough @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we find below half - filling a clear enhancement of the sc correlations with @xmath2 symmetry which is accompanied by a change in the type of boundary conditions leading to the lowest energy .",
    "this behavior is consistent with the idea that the large coulomb repulsion spreads out the fermi surface towards sectors of the brillouin zone where the interaction @xmath0 has the largest amplitude in the bcs channel with @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "in such a way , we can think that particles are pushed to a region of the phase space , where the attractive interaction is most efficient to organize them into pairs .",
    "similar arguments can be proposed to explain the enhancement of af correlations at half - filling since the @xmath0 interaction has components along af and sc channels . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been found that the angle - resolved quasiparticle weight @xmath103 renormalizes in such a way that it displays a maximum in regions of the fermi surface that are separated by the magnetic vector @xmath157 .",
    "we have not found strong differences between the behavior of @xmath103 in the usual hubbard model and the @xmath13 one neither at half - filling nor for finite doping .",
    "therefore , the most likely scenario at half - filling is that the larger population of convenient regions of the @xmath81-space become available to be exploited by the component of the @xmath0 interaction along the af channel .",
    "we have not found any indication of bond - order - like instability .",
    "this is in disagreement with some mean - field predictions @xcite but in full agreement with other rg studies on van - hove fillings of the @xmath158 models @xcite .",
    "our conclusion regarding the combined @xmath159 mechanism to drive large superconducting correlations is also in agreement with previous investigations based on fermi liquid arguments and quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite . within the repulsive hubbard model , we obtained by renormalization group that the self - energy corrections are fatal for superconductivity and by exact diagonalization that the superconductivity is unlikely",
    "this result is important because it reconciles the n - patch rg with exact diagonalization _ and _ with a number of other approaches .",
    "our results show that while the @xmath2 pairing exists in the hubbard model ( because vertex indeed diverges ) , the onset of macroscopic superconductivity is suppressed .",
    "this result is in agreement with the very recent findings by plekhanov and co - workers @xcite .",
    "all above remarks indicate that the @xmath0 interaction is vital for the superconductivity while the @xmath1 interaction increases considerably the tendency towards pair formation .",
    "they also suggest that minimal microscopic models supporting recent phenomenological proposals for colossal effects in the phase diagram of the high @xmath15 compounds @xcite may be based on these two interactions .",
    "in fact , our results indicate that the interaction @xmath0 provides a kick to the potential or weak antiferromagnetic and superconducting tendencies of the hubbard model , that triggers a gigantic response in the system .",
    "this picture resembles the behavior of manganites where colossal magnetoresistance effects take place in response to external magnetic fields and this analogy is behind the proposal of ref .",
    ". the appropriate microscopic approach should be based on a recently developed n - patch renormalization group theory for disordered and interacting imperfectly nested system @xcite . on the other hand , as discussed in our introductory section , derivations starting from the three band model for the cuprates also support the idea that the @xmath13 model is a good candidate for a minimal one - band hamiltonian for these materials .",

    "<S> using renormalization group with included self - energy effects and exact diagonalization of small clusters we investigate the ground state phase diagram of a two - dimensional extended hubbard model with nearest - neighbor exchange interaction @xmath0 , in addition to the local coulomb repulsion @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the main instabilities are antiferromagnetism close to half - filling and @xmath2 superconductivity in the doped system . </S>",
    "<S> we find that self - energy effects are fatal for superconductivity in the repulsive hubbard model ( i.e. @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity is _ triggered _ by finite @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the combined action of @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions provide a remarkably efficient mechanism to enhance both @xmath2 superconducting and antiferromagnetic correlations . </S>"
