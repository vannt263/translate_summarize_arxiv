    "to determine the spin and charge velocities we begin with the experimental determination of the velocities for @xmath81 , @xmath82ev@xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85ev@xmath83 .",
    "( here b is the lattice spacing . ) for @xmath84 we assume that the spectral response sees roughly equal contributions from the the spinon and the holon ( consistent with our theoretical analysis ) , and so the measured velocity is a arithmetic mean of the spinon and holon velocities : @xmath86 by how the mdc width grows with increasing binding energy ( see fig .",
    "5d ) , we can estimate the difference of @xmath87 and @xmath88 : @xmath89 this gives the spin and charge velocities for @xmath84 as @xmath90    for @xmath81 , we assume the spectral response is dominated by the branch with the lesser velocity , again consistent with our theoretical analysis , in this case the holon .",
    "thus it is this velocity that is directly measured : @xmath91 to determine the charge velocity @xmath92 for @xmath81 we resort to a theoretical analysis .",
    "this gives the spin and charge velocities in terms of the ( bare ) velocities of the bonding ( @xmath93 ) and anti - bonding ( @xmath94 ) bands and the effective zero frequency component of the coulombic interaction , @xmath95 , as @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 using these relations we can then determine the remaining unknown velocities as well as @xmath95 : @xmath98 we see that our analysis gives a value of @xmath95 consistent with blue bronze being only moderately interacting .",
    "it s negative value is consistent with ( and necessary for ) their being a gap in the spin sector @xcite .",
    "we can also show that the energy scale set by @xmath95 governs the size of the gap of the spinons .",
    "the spinon gap is given by @xmath50 @xcite where @xmath51 @xcite is the gap at half filling .",
    "the prefactor @xmath99 relating the gap at 3/4-filling to the gap at 1/2-filling is a rough estimate based on an @xmath100 symmetric theory .",
    "nonetheless we feel it is accurate to within a factor of 2 . while @xmath101 involves the @xmath102 fourier component of the coulomb interaction , it is reasonable to suppose this component is of the same magnitude of @xmath95 .",
    "this then gives @xmath103 and so in turn @xmath104 .",
    "taking the bandwidth @xmath105 as @xmath106 , we see that it makes a reasonable prediction for the magnitude of the observed spinon gap of @xmath107 .",

    "we do so because then at low energies the low energy description of the doped ladders @xcite admits a field theoretic reduction governed by an so(6 ) symmetry .",
    "this field theory description of the ladder allows us to compute analytically the expected contribution to the spectral response of the boundstate . while @xmath94 different than @xmath108 will distort this response , we believe that this computation , appropriately modified for the differing velocities ( as described below ) , will capture this response s gross features .",
    "following the procedure outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite for the computation of response functions in doped ladder systems , we can estimate the contribution of the bound state to the single particle response to be @xmath109 the above expression for the contribution of the bound state to the spectral function assumes @xmath110 . in order to then adapt it to our situation of @xmath72",
    ", we use the following heuristic .",
    "for @xmath84 we will take the spin and charge velocities , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , in the above to equal @xmath88 and @xmath87 ( see previous section of the supplementary material for the definition of these quantities ) .",
    "for @xmath81 we take @xmath63 and @xmath64 to instead equal @xmath111 and @xmath92 .",
    "we still expect the velocities for the dispersion of the bound state contribution to be different to the right and to the left of the fermi point because these differing velocities arise from a gallilean transformation to a frame where @xmath110 .",
    "what we do not expect is that the above captures correctly the intensity of the boundstate contribution quantitatively ( we might expect there to be ( large ) corrections on the order of @xmath112 ) , but merely provides a rough qualitative guide .",
    "however we can exclude the possibility that @xmath94 and @xmath93 are so different that the bound state does not even exist because the experimental data suggests otherwise .",
    "a final issue with which we must deal is the intensity of the bound state contribution relative to the contribution of the spinon and holon alone .",
    "we fix this intensity using the experimental intensities as a rough guide .",
    "thus in fig .",
    "3c of the main text we take the peak intensity of the bound state contribution to be approximately 1/6 that of the peak intensity of the holon and spinon alone .      in this section",
    "we discuss further the theoretical and experimental mdcs shown in fig .",
    "3 of the main text .",
    "we already know from fig .",
    "5d of the main text that the widths predicted by theory match those measured .",
    "we now also see that over a range of binding energies extending from 10mev to roughly 600mev that the theoretical mdcs match approximately their measured counterparts .",
    "beyond 600mev one begins to see that the theoretical mdcs become asymmetrical and develop structure within their central peak .",
    "this is a consequence of the bound state contribution to the mdcs , in particular the intensity .",
    "whereas the intensity of the spinon and holon contribution to the mdcs falls off relatively rapidly with increasing binding energy , the intensity of the computed bound state contribution does not .",
    "this contribution is found primarily at @xmath113 leading to a slight favoring of spectral weight towards this wave vector in the mdc . that this disagreement appears is not surprising given that our computation of the boundstate contribution to the spectral function is qualitative not quantitative .      in this final section",

    "however we also see that as the temperature is increased spectral features are blurred .",
    "the ability to distinguish between the contributions coming from the two branches ( soliton / holon and bound state / holon ) ceases at some temperature below t@xmath116 .",
    "this is to be expected .",
    "sharp spectral features in correlated one dimensional systems see marked rounding even for temperatures a small fraction of the spectral gap @xcite .",
    "while it is a difficult task to compute the thermal broadening in a strongly correlated electron system , the task is made easier if we focus on the holon / spinon contribution to the spectral function .",
    "we can then follow the strategy of ref . @xcite . at least at low temperatures ( @xmath117 )",
    ", we can understand the spectral function s thermal broadening by using the well understood form of the spectral contribution of the gapless holon ( that of a luttinger liquid at finite temperature @xcite ) while using the zero temperature form for the gapped spinon . while imperfect , this gives us a lower bound on the broadening of spectral lineshapes due to finite temperature .",
    "the results can be found in panel f of fig .",

    "the increase in weight at @xmath118 seen theoretically as temperature is increased from 19k to 240k matches that seen experimentally . on the other hand the decrease in weight at @xmath119 predicted theoretically by this calculation as temperature is increased underestimates that seen experimentally .",
    "while we again emphasize that our calculation only provides a lower bound on thermal broadening , it would certainly be reasonable ( and expected ) to need to ascribe some broadening to the presence of phonons .",

    "<S> the arpes measurements on the 1d mott - hubbard insulator , srcuo@xmath79 , considered the best evidence for spin - charge separation , also yield broad peaks much broader than the corresponding theoretical prediction ( see fig . 3 in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we believe that such broadening is an inherent feature of arpes measurements on poorly conducting systems .    to account for these additional broadening effects , we convolve the lineshapes with a gaussian of width @xmath80 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mdc ] , fig . 5b and 5c ) . a considerable increase in broadening accounts very well for the experimental lineshapes , leading to a flat but finite mdc width at low energies while at higher energies the mdc widths grows as would be expected in a system with differing spin and charge velocities , fig . </S>",
