    "revealing the physical mechanism responsible for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry is one of the most crucial issues in particle physics .",
    "if the fundamental particles such as leptons , quarks and gauge bosons remain weakly interacting up to very high energies , the sector in which the electroweak symmetry is broken must contain one or more fundamental scalar higgs bosons with masses of the order of the symmetry  breaking scale , however , if the standard model ( sm ) is embedded in a grand unified theory ( gut ) at high energies , the natural scale of the electroweak symmetry breaking would be expected close to the unification scale .",
    "supersymmetry @xcite provides an elegant solution to this hierarchy problem and furthermore leads to an excellent agreement between the value of the electroweak mixing angle @xmath4 predicted by the unification of the gauge couplings and the experimentally measured value .    of course",
    ", supersymmetry must be ( softly ) broken to be phenomenologically viable .",
    "in general , this breakdown introduces a large number of unknown parameters , many of which can be complex @xcite .",
    "cp  violating phases associated with sfermions of the first and , to a lesser extent , second generations are severely constrained by bounds on the electric dipole moments of the electron , neutron and muon",
    ". however , there have been several suggestions @xcite to evade these constraints without suppressing the cp  violating phases .",
    "one option is to make the first two generations of scalar fermions rather heavy so that one  loop edm constraints are automatically evaded . as a matter of fact one",
    "can consider so  called effective susy models @xcite where de - couplings of the first and second generation sfermions are invoked to solve the susy fcnc and cp problems without spoiling the naturalness condition .",
    "another possibility is to arrange for partial cancellations among various contributions to the electron and neutron edm s @xcite .    following the suggestions that the phases do not have to be suppressed ,",
    "many important works on the effects due to the cp phases in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) have been already reported ; the effects are very significant in extracting the parameters in the susy lagrangian from experimental data @xcite , estimating dark matter densities and scattering cross sections and higgs boson mass limits @xcite , cp violation in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 systems @xcite , and so on .",
    "in particular , it has been found @xcite that the higgs  sector cp violation induced via loop corrections of soft cp  violating yukawa interactions may drastically modify the couplings of the light neutral higgs boson to the gauge bosons . as a result , the current experimental lower bound on the lightest higgs boson mass",
    "may be dramatically relaxed up to a 60gev level in the presence of large cp violation in the higgs sector of the mssm .",
    "since the experimental observation of scalar higgs particles and the detailed confirmation of their fundamental properties are crucial for our present understanding of the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking , a very precise prediction of the production cross sections and of the branching ratios for the main decay channels is mandatory .",
    "so , several recent works @xcite have made the detailed predictions of the higgs mass spectrum and their production cross sections in the mssm with explicit cp violation .",
    "along with the mass spectrum and cross sections , it is also very important to estimate the branching ratios of the main higgs boson decays precisely .",
    "this indispensable requirement leads to our systematic study of the higgs boson decays in the mssm @xcite with explicit cp violation , where both higgs  boson masses and their couplings to fermions , gauge bosons are significantly affected by loop corrections of soft cp  violating yukawa interactions to the higgs sector .",
    "we provide a detailed quantitative estimate for the branching fractions of all possible two  body decay modes of three neutral higgs bosons and investigate the possibility of measuring cp violation through the fermion spin correlations in the neutral higgs decays into a tau ",
    "lepton pair and/or a top  quark pair .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : cp violation ] we give a brief review for the explicit cp violation in the higgs sector due to the significant contributions of radiative corrections from trilinear yukawa couplings of the higgs fields to scalar top and scalar bottom quarks .",
    "this review is mainly based on the work by pilaftsis and wagner @xcite .",
    "the parts involving other supersymmetric particles such as charginos and neutralinos can contribute to the effective higgs potential .",
    "but , the chargino and neutralino contributions are degraded in the present analysis with their masses taken to be of the order of a large susy breaking scale @xmath7 .",
    "then , we introduce the general mass matrix dictating the mixing among three neutral higgs states and the resulting lagrangian describing the couplings of the higgs bosons to fermions , gauge bosons , and higgs bosons themselves . in section [ sec : decay ]",
    "we discuss the effects of the cp phases on ( almost ) all the two  body higgs boson decays in detail , which will give an important phenomenological impact on higgs  boson searches .",

    "the mssm introduces several new parameters in the theory that are absent from the sm and could , in principle , possess many cp  violating phases .",
    "specifically , the new cp phases may come from the following parameters : ( i ) the higgsino mass parameter @xmath8 , which involves the bilinear mixing of the two higgs chiral superfields in the superpotential ; ( ii ) the soft susy  breaking gaugino masses @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , where the index @xmath11 stands for the gauge groups u(1)@xmath12 , su(2)@xmath13 and su(3)@xmath14 , respectively ; ( iii ) the soft bilinear higgs mixing masses @xmath15 , which is sometimes denoted as @xmath16 in the literature ; ( iv ) the soft trilinear yukawa couplings @xmath17 of the higgs particles to scalar fermions ; and ( v ) the flavor mixing elements of the sfermions mass matrices . if the universality condition is imposed on all gaugino masses at the unification scale @xmath18 , the gaugino masses @xmath9 have a common phase , and if the diagonal boundary conditions are added to the universality condition for the sfermion mass matrices at the gut scale , the flavor mixing elements of the sfermions mass matrices vanish and the different trilinear couplings @xmath17 are all equal , i.e. @xmath19 . the conformal",

    ", the radiative corrections generate various new interaction vertices among the neutral higgs fields and the charged higgs fields , which are absent in the cp  invariant mssm .    finally , we emphasize that the size of cp violation due to radiative corrections to the higgs potential is characterized by a dimensionless parameter @xmath94 @xmath95 where @xmath96 , i.e. the sum of three cp  violating phases .",
    "so , for @xmath97 and @xmath98 values larger than the susy  breaking scale @xmath7 , the cp  violating effects can be significant .",
    "higgs - boson masses are not determined a priori within the theory and their decay patterns depend strongly on the masses as well as several susy parameters .",

    "boson mass is very sensitive to the cp  violating phase @xmath106 and becomes very close to the lightest higgs boson mass around @xmath110 . *",
    "the heaviest higgs  boson is almost degenerate with the charged higgs boson except the region with a small charged higgs boson mass . * except the lightest higgs boson mass , the other higgs boson masses increase with the charged higgs mass , which is treated as a free parameter .",
    "one can also notice that the the minimum values of the allowed heavier higgs masses under the constraint @xmath108 gev depend strongly on the cp phase .",
    "these features clearly suggest that while the decay pattern of the lightest neutral higgs boson might be rather insensitive to the cp phase and the charged higgs mass , the decay patterns of the other neutral higgs bosons and the charged higgs boson itself are very sensitive to them .      in most cases ,",
    "the most important decay channels of the higgs bosons are two  body decays to the heaviest particles because the higgs couplings to the sm particles are proportional to their masses .",
    "sometimes , because of the coupling enhancement below ",
    "threshold three  body decays of the higgs bosons may also be important @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in this work we concentrate on only two  body decay channels .",
    "on the other hand , if supersymmetric particles are light enough , higgs bosons can decay into supersymmetric particles .",
    "however , since we have assumed a common susy scale of the order of 1 tev , decays to sfermions , neutalinos , and charginos are not expected to play an important role in the higgs mass range of a few hundred gev which we are analyzing .",
    "let us now present the explicit form of each higgs boson decay width .",

    "lepton modes give most dominant contributions to the decay width of the lightest higgs boson due to their relatively large yukawa couplings .",
    "numerically , the branching ratio of the bottom  quark channel is almost 90% and the tau ",
    "lepton mode is 10% in the almost whole range of the allowed lightest higgs boson mass .",
    "moreover , if the masses of the heavier higgs bosons are smaller than the threshold of two @xmath75 s , they will be the main decay channels for the heavy states as well .",
    "as stated in the expression , the fermionic decay width is strongly dependent on the fermion mass so that the exact determination of the mass is required for the precise estimate of the branching ratio . keeping this point in mind",
    ", we simply take @xmath116 gev and @xmath117 gev for our numerical analysis .",
    "secondly , the decay widths of the higgs bosons into a gauge boson pair can be obtained by the lagrangian for the higgs couplings to the gauge bosons .",
    "the analytic form of those decay widths can be summarized as follows : @xmath118 where @xmath119 or @xmath1 , @xmath120 is 2 for the @xmath75 boson and 1 for the @xmath1 boson , @xmath121 is the velocity of the gauge boson in the rest frame of the higgs boson , and @xmath122 .",
    "note that two decay widths are of the same form and for @xmath123 the ratio of @xmath124 to @xmath125 rates approaches @xmath126 .",
    "clearly , since the decay widths are proportional to the third power of the higgs boson mass itself , these decay channels are expected to contribute dominantly to the decay widths of the heavy higgs bosons . on the contrary ,",
    "the partial width of the decay @xmath127 is strongly suppressed or vanishing due to kinematics , thus not playing a dominant role even if the decay channel with one off  shell gauge boson is considered . in the born approximation , the intermediate higgs boson is the pseudoscalar boson so that the decay @xmath128 is not allowed .",
    "however , beyond the born approximation , this mass eigenstate will have a large portion of the light or heavy scalar higgs states and as a result there will be a large enhancement for the branching ratio for non  trivial values of the cp phase @xmath106 in this specific decay channel unique to the cp  noninvariant theory .",
    "thirdly , the heavy higgs  boson decays into a light higgs boson and a gauge boson can be classified into the charged decays @xmath129 and the neutral decays @xmath130 .",

    "the width of the latter decay channel is given by @xmath139 with @xmath140 the velocity of the charged higgs boson in the rest frame of the decaying neutral higgs boson @xmath71 and @xmath141 .",
    "on the other hand , the width for the former decay channel @xmath137 is given by @xmath142 where @xmath143 is 2 for @xmath144 and 1 for @xmath145 , and @xmath146 .    finally , the decays of the higgs bosons into two gluons @xcite , which occur through quark one  loop diagrams may be sizable . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the two  gluon partial width of the higgs bosons is important because it is the main production mechanism for the higgs boson production at the @xmath147 collider lhc .",
    "moreover , since gluons couple to higgs bosons via heavy particle loops , the two  gluon widths are sensitive to heavy particle masses , standard and also supersymmetric , well above the higgs masses themselves .",

    "* through the whole range of the allowed @xmath25 mass , the fermionic decay channel remains as one of the dominant channels .",
    "however , the decay channel @xmath135 also becomes a dominant channel if the channel is open .",
    "* the decay channel @xmath167 overwhelms all other decay channels as soon as it is allowed .",
    "* if the cp phase @xmath106 vanishes , the channel @xmath168 is prohibited , reflecting that the cp ",
    "odd state can not decay into two identical cp  even states when the system is cp  invariant .",
    "however , the contribution of this decay mode becomes sizable or suppressed as the cp phase @xmath106 varies from zero .",
    "* the decay channels @xmath165 and @xmath128 are prohibited for the vanishing cp phase .",
    "but , they along with the channel @xmath169 can be also sizable and become the most dominant channel for some values of the cp phase @xmath106 .",
    "these interesting features are partly because of a significant mixing between cp  even and cp  odd states .",
    "as shown clearly in fig .  5 of the work by pilaftsis and wanger @xcite , the couplings of @xmath25 to @xmath170 and , in particular , to @xmath125 increases with the phase",
    "@xmath106 up to 90@xmath171 so that they clearly enhance the decay channels @xmath135 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dominance of the decay channel @xmath169 for a large mass range of the higgs boson @xmath25 is mainly due to a large enhancement of the coupling strength of the @xmath172 vertex with a non  trivial phase .",
    "this distinct and unique feature may give a strong hint of the existence of a non  vanishing cp phase in the stop or sbottom sector .",
    "when the cp phase is zero , the heaviest higgs boson is the heavier cp  even state so that the decay channels @xmath173 and @xmath174 ( @xmath175 of @xmath1 ) are among the dominant channels .",
    "this fact is clearly shown in figure  5 for the partial branching ratios of various @xmath109 decay channels with respect to the mass @xmath176 . in every frame of figure  5 the upper solid line is for the sum of all available fermionic decay channels , two dotted lines for the decay channels into two gauge bosons , the dot  dashed line for the decay channel @xmath177 , the dashed line for the decay channel @xmath173 and finally the lower solid line for the two  gluon mode .",
    "these decays of the heaviest higgs boson @xmath109 also exhibit several interesting features :    * before the @xmath3 channel is open , the channels @xmath173 and @xmath174 are dominant , while they are overwhelmed by the @xmath3 mode as soon as the latter mode is available .",
    "we note the similar behavior of @xmath178 and @xmath82 presented in figure 4 , a natural consequence from the relation ( [ eq : relation ] ) among the couplings of the neutral higgs bosons to gauge bosons . * the channel @xmath179 is always prohibited , which reflects that three higgs mass eigenstates are originated from two cp  even states and one cp  odd state , and there do not exist any interactions between two different cp  even states and one cp  odd state . *",
    "the channel @xmath180 is not kinematically allowed for the whole mass range even though there exists the coupling for the decay mode . *",
    "the decay channel @xmath177 is prohibited for the vanishing cp phase , but the contribution of the decay channel to the total width becomes sizable as the cp phase varies from zero .",
    "moreover , this mode overwhelms the other decay modes near the lower tail of the allowed @xmath109 mass for some nontrivial values of the cp phase .",
    "we note again the similar behavior of @xmath181 and @xmath182 presented in figure 4 .",
    "all these interesting features can be understood by noting that the cp  even and cp  odd compositions of the heavy higgs mass eigenstates are strongly dependent on the value of th cp phase @xmath106 .",
    "to recapitulate , the mass spectrum and the branching fractions of the lightest higgs boson @xmath24 are not so sensitive to the cp  violating phase , but those of the heavy higgs states are very sensitive to the phase .",
    "it means that the cp phase may cause in most cases a larger mixing of the cp",
    " odd state with the heavy cp  even state than the light cp  even state , although the mixing with the light one also may be substantial , in particular for light charged higgs boson masses . from our detailed analysis , it is clear that the cp phase will affect the phenomenology of the heavy higgs  boson decays very significantly so that the heavy higgs boson searches will depend very strongly on the cp phase as well as the other susy parameters .",
    "in section  [ sec : decay ] , we have found that the branching ratios of the lightest higgs boson decays are ( almost ) independent of the cp phase @xmath106 , and we have noted that for a large value of @xmath62 the neutral higgs boson masses and the branching ratios of the other neutral higgs boson decays also become insensitive to the cp phase .",
    "however , the cp  violation effects caused by the loop corrections of soft cp  violating yukawa couplings can be directly measured by an azimuthal cp  odd decay asymmetry in the decays @xmath183 and/or @xmath184 @xcite reflecting the correlations of two transversely polarized fermions . in this section",
    ", we estimate the size of the azimuthal cp ",
    "odd asymmetry in the mssm with explicit cp violation through radiative corrections .    for the sake of discussion",
    ", we calculate the helicity amplitude explicitly for the higgs boson decays @xmath185 by use of the so  called 2component spinor technique @xcite .",
    "the result is written as @xmath186    \\delta_{\\sigma\\bar{\\sigma}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath187 and @xmath188 are for the helicity of the fermions @xmath150 and @xmath189 , respectively , with @xmath190 or @xmath68 .",
    "it is now clear that the helicity amplitude can be complex when both the scalar and pseudoscalar parts co - exist and the interference , signaling cp violation , can be extracted by adjusting the polarization of the final fermions . as a result",
    ", we obtain the following cp  odd asymmetry in terms of @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 : @xmath194 in order to observe the cp violating spin  correlation of the top quarks or @xmath70leptons , we need to look at the correlations among their decay products .",
    "the analysis power for the spins depends on each decay mode @xcite .",
    "for example , if the top quark decays semi  leptonically , the spin analysis power is unity , but if it decays hadronically , the analysis power is about @xmath195 .",
    "similarly , if the @xmath70 decays semi  leptonically , the analysis power is @xmath196 . and , the inclusive hadronic decays of the @xmath70 is known to give the analysis power of @xmath197 .",
    "certainly , if one can analyze the detailed structure of the hadronic decays , one can obtain better results .",
    "although we can do a more comprehensive numerical analysis for evaluating the possibility of detecting cp violation in the fermion decays , for simplicity we confine ourselves to estimating the size of the cp ",
    "odd asymmetry in the present work . since the effectiveness of a decay channel in measuring cp violation directly depends on the number of events as well as the size of the cp ",
    "odd asymmetry , it is useful to define an effective cp ",
    "odd asymmetry as @xmath198 with this new effective cp  odd quantity , we can easily estimate the number of higgs bosons required to see the cp ",
    "violation effect directly at 1@xmath187 level .",
    "the number before including the detection efficiency and the polarization analysis powers is simply given by @xmath199 for a more realistic estimate , we refer to the work by atwood and soni of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "odd asymmetry is strongly dependent on the value of @xmath62 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath2 mode is expected to be greatly enhanced as @xmath62 increases . in this light , it is interesting to consider a large @xmath62 case as well , so we consider two values of @xmath200 and @xmath201 for comparison .",
    "the dependence of the cp",
    " odd asymmetry on the charged higgs boson mass @xmath58 for several values of the cp phase in the decays @xmath202 is present in figures  6 , 7 , and 8 , respectively , for two values of @xmath62 ; the solid line is for @xmath200 and the dashed line for @xmath203 .",
    "we find that the cp ",
    "odd asymmetry in the decay @xmath204 is very sensitive to the charge higgs boson mass @xmath58 and can be significant near the lower tail of its allowed mass range for non  trivial values of the cp phase .",
    "otherwise , the cp  odd asymmetry decreases as @xmath58 increases .",
    "this is due to the suppression of the mixing matrix element @xmath205 representing the composition of the cp  odd state in the lightest higgs boson .",
    "similarly , near the lower tail of the allowed charged higgs boson mass , the cp ",
    "odd asymmetry for @xmath206 also is very sensitive to the charged higgs boson mass . otherwise , the cp  odd asymmetries remain constant instead of decreasing for the whole range of the charged higgs boson mass , but they oscillate between -1 and 1 as the cp phase varies .",
    "odd asymmetry for the decay @xmath207 is ( almost ) independent of the charged higgs boson mass , but it is also very sensitive to the cp  phase . on the other hand , the large value of the top ",
    "quark mass prohibits the lightest higgs boson from decaying into a top ",
    "quark pair .",
    "so , we consider the decays @xmath208 , of which the dependence on the charged higgs boson mass @xmath58 for several values of the cp phase is presented in figures  9 and 10 . near the lower tail of the allowed charged higgs boson mass , the cp ",
    "odd asymmetry for @xmath167 is very sensitive to the charged higgs boson mass as that for @xmath206 .",
    "otherwise , the cp  odd asymmetry remains constant for the whole range of the charged higgs boson mass , but it oscillates between -1 and 1 as the cp phase varies .",
    "odd asymmetry for the decay @xmath209 are almost independent of the charged higgs boson mass , but it is also sensitive to the cp phase .",
    "in this paper , we have performed a systematic study of the neutral higgs boson decays in the mssm with explicit cp violation , which is induced through loop corrections involving trilinear cp  violating couplings of the neutral higgs bosons to scalar top and bottom quarks and can be sizable . certainly , our analysis is far from complete in the sense that any below  threshold three  body decay channels and comprehensive qcd corrections , which may be significant , are not included .",
    "therefore , a more complete work is needed and it is to be reported elsewhere .",
    "the analysis on the branching ratios of the neutral higgs boson decays shows that the decay pattern of the lightest neutral higgs boson is almost independent of the cp phase , but the decay patterns of two other neutral higgs bosons are very sensitive to the phase .",
    "since the explicit cp violation is realized through the scalar  pseudoscalar mixing between the cp  odd higgs state and , mainly , the heavy cp  even higgs state , the decay patterns of two mass eigenstates are determined by the size of the mixing . moreover , the dependence of each decay mode on the cp phase is different .",
    "therefore , it is naturally expected that as the cp phase varies from zero , the branching ratios change a lot . in particular , for the intermediate higgs boson ( which is nothing but the cp  odd higgs state in the cp invariant case ) the channels @xmath210 and @xmath211 ( @xmath175 or @xmath1 ) , prohibited for the vanishing cp phase and so unique to the cp  noninvariant theory , can be sizable and become the most dominant channels for some nontrivial values of the cp phase . furthermore , for the heaviest higgs state ( which is the heavier cp  even state in the cp invariant limit ) the decay channel @xmath177 prohibited for the vanishing cp phase may overwhelm the other possible decay channels near the lower tail of the allowed @xmath109 mass range for some nontrivial values of the cp phase .",
    "we have also presented a numerical analysis of the cp",
    " odd asymmetry that can be extracted through spin correlations of the fermions in the fermionic decays of the neutral higgs bosons , @xmath183 and @xmath212 .",
    "odd asymmetry is very sensitive to the value of @xmath62 , in particular , for the decay @xmath213 . for a large value of @xmath62 ,",
    "the branching ratio for the decay channel is enhanced and moreover the cp ",
    "odd asymmetry becomes significant for small higgs boson masses .",
    "however , we have found that the cp ",
    "odd asymmetry for the higgs boson @xmath24 decreases as the charged higgs boson mass @xmath58 increases increases due to the suppression of @xmath205 . except the lower tail of the allowed charged higgs boson mass , the cp  odd asymmetries for both @xmath214 and @xmath208 remain constant for the charged higgs boson mass , but on the whole , the cp ",
    "odd asymmetry can be saturated to be 1 so that there is a great chance to see cp violation due to radiative corrections directly through the spin correlations of the tau leptons and / ot top  quarks in the fermionic decays of any neutral higgs boson .",
    "to conclude , the analysis presented in this paper clearly demonstrates that the explicit cp violation in the mssm higgs sector may modify the higgs boson decays significantly so that it will have a great impact on higgs searches , and give a great chance to measure the effects directly through the cp ",
