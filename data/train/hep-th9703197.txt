    "the exact solutions @xcite for the ir wilsonian effective theory of n=1 supersymmetric qcd ( sqcd ) reveal some surprising dynamical effects .",
    "most striking are the occurence of massless composite bound states ( or solitons ) in the strong coupling regime .",
    "it is intriguing whether these massless states could smoothly map to states important to the dynamics of non - supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "it is highly implausible that the massless composite fermions of sqcd can survive in the qcd limit .",
    "the lattice arguments of weingarten @xcite imply that any composite states in qcd must be heavier than the pions . nevertheless , it is possible , for example , that the scalar `` dual quark '' solitons might survive in some form and be involved in some `` dual magnetic '' description of confinement in qcd .",
    "soft breaking terms , such as squark and gaugino masses , may be introduced to the sqcd theories as spurion fields with non - zero f - component vevs that explicitly break supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the symmetries of the enlarged spurion model constrain how they may appear in the low energy wilsonian theory . in general",
    "these constraints are not however sufficient to determine the low energy theory since `` kahler potential '' terms may be constructed that are invariant to all symmetries and are hence unknown @xcite . for the cases where a squark and/or gaugino mass are the sole supersymmetry and chiral symmetry breaking parameters these kahler terms dominate the behaviour of the potential .",
    "some speculations as to the behaviour of these theories were made in refs @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss these difficulties and investigate some cases in which the effects of the soft breakings _ can _ be controlled .",
    "we start with a model with supersymmetry preserving quark / squark masses , and then break supersymmetry with squark and gaugino masses resulting from spurions that occur linearly in the superpotential .",
    "it can be shown that any possible kahler corrections are higher order in the soft breakings , and thus control may be retained over the low - energy theory .",
    "the analysis is similar to that performed on the n=2 sqcd solutions in ref @xcite .",
    "the derivative ( low - energy ) expansion performed to obtain the solutions of sqcd restricts the solutions of the softly broken models to the regime where the soft breakings are small relative to the strong interaction scale . at first sight",
    "the resulting models appear to behave almost identically to their supersymmetric counterparts but , as for the n=2 solutions @xcite , the models have the additional new feature of displaying @xmath0 angle dependence .",
    "the softly broken models distinguish the @xmath1 vacua of the sqcd models and as @xmath0 is changed these vacua interchange at first order phase transitions .",
    "we contrast this behaviour with that of the qcd chiral lagrangian .",
    "we begin from the n=1 @xmath2 sqcd theories with @xmath3 flavors described by the uv lagrangian @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the standard chiral matter superfields and @xmath7 the gauge superfield .",
    "the coupling @xmath8 determines the kinetic normalization of the matter fields .",
    "the gauge coupling @xmath9 defines a dynamical scale of sqcd : @xmath10 , with @xmath11 the one loop coefficient of the sqcd @xmath12-function . and",
    ", finally , @xmath13 is a supersymmetric mass term for the matter fields .",
    "we may raise these couplings to the status of spurion chiral superfields which are then frozen with scalar component vevs . the sqcd theory without a mass term has the symmetries @xmath14 the mass term breaks the chiral symmetries to the vector symmetry .",
    "the classical @xmath15 symmetry on the matter fields is anomalous and , if there is a massless quark , may be used to rotate away the theta angle . in the massive theory the flavor symmetries",
    "may be used to rotate @xmath16 to diagonal form and the anomalous @xmath17 symmetry under which the @xmath5s have charge @xmath18 may be used to rotate @xmath0 on to the massless gaugino . including the spurion fields the non - anomalous @xmath17 symmetry charges are @xmath19 the anomalous symmetries may be restored to the status of symmetries of the model if we also allow the spurions to transform .",
    "the appropriate charges are @xmath20 the @xmath16 spurions also transform under the chiral flavor group .",
    "the solutions of the models are @xmath3 dependent . for @xmath21 the low energy superpotential",
    "is exactly determined by the symmetries and the theory has a run away vacuum @xcite . for @xmath22",
    "the low energy theory is in terms of meson and baryon fields @xmath23 } & = & q^{i_1 } ...",
    "q^{i_{n_c}}\\\\ \\tilde{b}^{[i_1, ...",
    ",i_n ] } & = & \\tilde{q}^{i_1 } ...",
    "\\tilde{q}^{i_{n_c } } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] subject to the constraint @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "for @xmath25 the theory is again described by baryon and meson fields with the classical moduli space unchanged @xcite .",
    "when @xmath26 the theory has an alternative description of the low energy physics in terms of a dual magnetic theory with an @xmath27 gauge group , @xmath3 flavors of dual quarks , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and @xmath30 meson fields , @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the dual theory has the additional superpotential term @xmath32 .",
    "generally one of the two duals is strongly coupled whilst the other is weakly coupled ( the electric theory is weakly coupled for @xmath33 , the magnetic theory when @xmath34 ) . in the strongly coupled variables the low energy wilsonian effective",
    "theory is a complicated theory with all higher dimensional terms in the superfields equally important ( since the ir theory is in a conformal regime the scale @xmath35 at which the theory entered the conformal regime is not available to suppress higher dimension terms and similarly the gauge coupling is order one and may not suppress these operators ) .",
    "the weakly interacting theory however , has a very simple wilsonian effective theory of the canonical bare form . according to the duality conjecture these two effective theories",
    "must describe the same physics and therefore there is presumably a ( complicated ) mapping between the electric and magnetic variables in the ir .",
    "soft breaking interactions terms which explicitly break supersymmetry may be included in the uv theory by allowing the spurions to acquire non - zero @xmath36-components.(these are the terms that can be induced by spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and hence may be included perturbatively while inducing only logarithmic divergences in the theory as a remnant of the supersymmetric non - renormalization theorems @xcite ) .",
    "we will consider three such breaking terms , a squark mass ( @xmath37 ) , a gaugino mass ( @xmath38 ) and a squark mass mixing ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the dependence of the ir effective theory on the spurion fields is determined in the n=1 limit by the dependence on their scalar components , the couplings and masses .",
    "the exact solutions of seiberg , however , do not provide sufficient information to take the soft breakings to infinity limit and obtain results for models with completely decoupled superpartners since the solutions are only low energy derivative expansions .",
    "higher dimension terms are suppressed by the strong coupling scale @xmath35 and hence in the non - supersymmetric theories there are unknown soft breaking terms of higher order in @xmath40 .",
    "a second problem is that squark masses are only generated through the kahler potential ( the spurion @xmath41 generates a squark mass mixing but it is unbounded without additional contributions to the masses from the kahler sector ) via such terms as @xmath42 with @xmath43 a general spurion .",
    "there are no symmetry constraints on these terms so we do not know whether they occur in the low energy theory or if they do , their sign .",
    "we note that the sign of these terms relative to the sign of the equivalent terms in the uv theory is crucial . as a particular example consider theories close to @xmath44 where the electric theory has a very weak ir fixed point and the magnetic theory a strongly coupled ir fixed point .",
    "we are interested in what happens when we introduce squark and gaugino masses in the uv magnetic theory .",
    "we can consider the case where these soft breakings are small relative to the scale @xmath35 at which the theory enters it s strongly interacting conformal phase .",
    "we expect a conformal phase down to the soft breaking scale but can we say anything about the theory below that scale ?",
    "the dual squarks in the weakly coupled ir description only acquire masses from @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the kahler terms .",
    "for infinitesimal soft breakings we do not expect the weakly coupled nature of the dual theory at the breaking scale to be disturbed . if these masses are positive ( as investigated in ref@xcite ) then below the soft breaking scale the theory behaves like qcd and presumably confines and breaks chiral symmetries at an exponentially small scale relative to the soft breaking masses .",
    "alternatively if the masses are negative ( as investigated in ref@xcite ) then the magnetic gauge group is higgsed with the possible interpretation in the electric variables of a dual meissner type effect .",
    "the spurion symmetry arguments are not sufficient to distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "it should be remarked that there _ is _ a strongly coupled magnetic theory that corresponds to the introduction of any soft breaking terms in the electric theory .",
    "this is true since we can use the mapping of electric to magnetic field variables from the sqcd theory ( which is not known explicitly , but exists in principle ) to write the soft breaking terms of the simple weakly interacting theory in terms of the strongly interacting variables in the ir .",
    "the result will be a complicated mess of relevant higher dimension operators in the strongly interacting theory .",
    "the subtlety is that if we now run the renormalization group back to the uv in the magnetic variables we will , very likely , never recover a weakly interacting theory . at each step to recover the effective theory at the lower scale we must add important higher dimension terms .",
    "the problem is therefore to identify which soft breaking terms in the ir electric description correspond to canonical soft breaking terms in the uv magnetic theory .    in the next section",
    "we shall resolve this problem for the @xmath45 and @xmath41 cases after including a supersymmetric mass that determines the squark masses at order @xmath47 .",
    "then for small soft breakings relative to @xmath13 ( and @xmath35 ) exact solutions may be obtained .",
    "to obtain solutions to softly broken n=1 sqcd theories , we begin by including a supersymmetric mass for the matter fields .",
    "the resulting theories have a mass gap on the scale @xmath13 and the induced meson @xmath48 vev is determined independently of @xmath3 by holomorphy @xmath49 the resulting supersymmetric theories have @xmath1 distinct vacua corresponding to the @xmath1th roots of unity , @xmath50 ( as predicted by the witten index ) . note that for the theories with magnetic duals putting masses in for all flavors breaks the dual gauge group completely . for simplicity henceforth we shall take @xmath16 to be proportional to the identity matrix ; in this basis @xmath51 is also proportional to the identity matrix .",
    "these massive theories may be softly broken in a controlled fashion .",
    "if the spurion generating the soft breaking enters the superpotential linearly then we may obtain desirable results when that spurion s f - component @xmath52 .",
    "any d - term contributions to the scalar potential take the form @xmath53 with @xmath54 and @xmath55 standing for generic fields or spurions . in the supersymmetric limit",
    "all f - components are zero and will grow as the vacuum expectation value of the soft breaking spurion .",
    "these kahler terms are therefore higher order in the soft breaking parameter than the linear term from the superpotential .",
    "the unknown corrections to the squark masses in the theory are subleading to the masses generated by the supersymmetric mass term and hence we may determine the potential minima at lowest order .        the resulting potential ( [ fmpotential ] ) distinguishes the @xmath1 vacua . for @xmath71",
    "the @xmath72 vacua is the true minima .",
    "@xmath73    fig.1 : first order phase transition as @xmath61 is varied from 0 to @xmath74 .    as @xmath61 passes through @xmath74",
    "the @xmath75 vacua become degenerate and there is a first order phase transition .",
    "then as @xmath61 moves through ( odd)@xmath74 there are subsequent first order phase transitions at which the sqcd minima interchange .      in the uv theory we may induce a gaugino mass through a non zero f - component of the gauge coupling @xmath76 @xmath77\\ ] ] in the ir theory @xmath76 enters through the strong interaction scale @xmath35 which again occurs linearly in the superpotential of the theory . taking @xmath78",
    "we again may determine the vacuum structure .",
    "the ir superpotential terms compatible with the symmetries of the theory involving @xmath35 are @xmath79\\ ] ] where the final term results from non - perturbative effects in the broken gauge group . at lowest order in perturbation theory the vev of @xmath31",
    "is given by ( [ slimit ] ) which also contains @xmath35 and hence has a non - zero f - component . including @xmath45 and performing the superspace integral we obtain up to a coefficient the following corrections to the potential that break the degeneracy between the @xmath1 sqcd vacua @xmath80\\\\ & = \\nonumber & - \\left|m^{n_f / n_c } f_\\tau \\lambda^{(3n_c - n_f)/                  n_c}\\right| \\cos [ ~ \\theta_{phys}/n_c ~+~ \\alpha ~]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where again @xmath81 are the @xmath1th roots of unity and @xmath61 is the physical theta angle in which the physics must be @xmath64 periodic .",
    "it may be obtained by again making rotations with the anomalous @xmath15 and @xmath17 symmetries @xmath82 the factor of @xmath83 occurs as a result of the discrepancy between the phase of @xmath45 and that of the canonical definition of the gaugino mass .",
    "there is also an additional contribution to the vacuum energy arising from the gaugino condensate . using the konishi anomaly @xcite",
    ", we see that it has the same form as ( [ gpot ] ) . the supersymmetry breaking contributions again break the degeneracy between the @xmath1 supersymmetric vacua .",
    "there are again phase transitions as @xmath61 is varied , occurring at @xmath84(odd)@xmath74 .",
    "we have investigated some examples where controlled , low - energy descriptions of softly broken massive sqcd may be obtained , despite the lack of supersymmetry .",
    "the models we studied are obtained by the inclusion of soft breaking masses from spurions occuring linearly in the superpotential .",
    "examples of such soft breaking terms are gaugino masses and squark mass mixings.the soft breaking corrections to the potential distinguish between the @xmath1 vacua of sqcd at a generic value of theta angle . at the special values of @xmath85(odd)@xmath74",
    "there are first order phase transitions at which two of the @xmath1 vacua interchange .",
    "this behavior can be compared with the theta angle dependence of the qcd chiral lagrangian @xcite for which there are @xmath3 distinct vacua which interchange through first order phase transitions at @xmath86(odd)@xmath74 .",
    "this difference in the number of vacua between the softly broken theories and qcd would prohibit us from seeing any sign of a smooth transition between the two theories ( one might hope that the @xmath31 vev might smoothly map to the quark condensates of qcd for example ) even if we were able to begin to take the squark and gaugino masses towards infinity .",
    "there is however one conclusion for qcd that we can tentatively draw from this analysis . in these models",
    "the form of the confined effective theory changes smoothly with the theta angle and there is no sign of a break down of confinement as suggested in @xcite .",
    "this lends some support to the assumption @xcite that the chiral lagrangian remains the correct discription of qcd in the ir even at non - zero theta .",
