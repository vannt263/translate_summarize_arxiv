    "if a molecule features partially occupied close - lying frontier orbitals , single - configuration methods such as hartree  fock ( hf )  and also contemporary approaches based on single - determinant kohn  sham density functional theory ( dft )  will not provide a reliable approximation of the electronic wave function .",
    "this can only be achieved by a superposition of configurations ( configuration interaction , ci ) .",
    "since the number of possible configurations is in general enormous , a selection of configurations becomes unavoidable in practice .",
    "however , a configuration selection procedure should lead to a well - defined approximation of an electronic state in order to avoid any bias or arbitrariness in the wave function model .",
    "complete active space ( cas ) approaches@xcite are well - defined models , because _ all _ possible configurations within some orbital subspace are considered . in general , an active space as compact as possible is desirable that includes all statically correlated orbitals to clearly discriminate between static and dynamic correlation.@xcite    the restriction of the size of the orbital space then requires a recipe for the selection of the active orbitals , causing the construction of the cas to feature an element of ambiguity . as a consequence , extensive studies were performed to deduce general selection rules.@xcite however , the cas selection still remains a delicate task that was described as  a tremendous challenge@xcite .",
    "this manual selection of orbitals was also rated as  highly subjective and can lead to serious problems@xcite and it was realized that one  must experiment.@xcite    the recent developments in the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite applied to quantum chemistry@xcite offer a remedy for these disadvantages for two reasons :    1 .   with dmrg one can perform calculations for active orbital spaces of up to about one hundred orbitals as opposed to a rather limited size of the cas in traditional methods due to exponential scaling ( restricted to about 18 electrons in 18 orbitals@xcite ) .",

    ", dmrg optimizations can produce a qualitatively correct approximate wave function after comparatively few iterations before energy convergence is reached.@xcite    since dmrg is rather flexible with respect to the size of the cas and partially converged dmrg solutions can be obtained quickly , a protocol for the automated active orbital space selection is in reach .",

    "the entanglement measures will be essential for the selection protocol of the active orbital space .",
    "our automated active orbital space selection is then realized with python scripts based on selection criteria to be developed in the next section .",
    "the entropy based entanglement measures should be available at low computational cost in order to be useful .",
    "therefore , an approximate and hence fast calculation for a large active space of orbitals chosen around the fermi level is performed to identify highly entangled orbitals that can then be selected for the final calculation .",
    "we first investigate whether the entanglement measures calculated from an approximate wave function obtained in a partially converged , but fast dmrg calculation are qualitatively correct .",
    "the upper panel of figure [ ent_conv ] shows entanglement diagrams containing a graphical representation of single - orbital entropies and mutual information for the permanganate ion with an active orbital space that includes all valence orbitals .",
    "three different dmrg settings are specified in the centers of these circular diagrams . in the lower panel , a similar set of diagrams",
    "is shown for chloroiron corrole with a significantly larger cas , i.e. a cas(50,67 ) .",
    "+ the dmrg algorithm requires an initial guess of the environment states in the first iterations until one sweep is completed.@xcite the importance of a suitable initial guess , such as the ci dynamically extended active space ( ci - deas ) approach@xcite , is obvious from the results for chloroiron corrole for which a guess that only ensures the incorporation of the hf determinant fails to produce the correct entanglement pattern ( see lower left corner of figure [ ent_conv ] ) .",
    "combined with a moderate number of renormalized block states of @xmath29 , the entanglement measures obtained with the ci - deas guess are hardly distinguishable from the converged results .",
    "this observation equally holds for the single - orbital entropy and the mutual information .     and chloroiron corrole with hartree ",
    "fock orbitals .",
    "all orbitals are numbered and arranged on a circle .",
    "the area of the red circles assigned to each numbered orbital is proportional to the single - orbital entropy of the respective orbital .",
    "the line connecting two orbitals denotes their mutual information value .",
    "the lines in black indicate a value of @xmath27 of at least 0.1 , whereas dashed gray and green lines represent mutual information values of at least 0.01 and 0.001 , respectively . for the small cas in the top panel",
    "it is feasible to show the orbitals , whereas this is not possible for the large active space in the lower panel .",
    "the molecular structures and dmrg settings are shown in the centers of the diagrams .",
    "energies are given in hartree , e@xmath30 . ]    for moderate active space sizes ( see the results for mno@xmath1 ) even faster calculations with @xmath31 and a hf initial guess result in sufficiently accurate entanglement measures despite the fact that the energy is still far from being converged .",
    "we observe this independently of the type of orbitals and the degree of entanglement present in the molecule .",
    "it was noted quite early that the convergence of dmrg calculations with hf orbitals tends to be slow@xcite and we therefore present data for this most critical type of orbitals in figure [ ent_conv ] .",
    "we observed the same results for all four types of orbitals independent on the number of orbitals in the active space ( data for these other orbitals are not shown ) .",
    "we recommend the ci - deas guess and @xmath29 for active spaces with more than 30 orbitals to guarantee sufficiently accurate entanglement measures at low computational cost .",
    "the calculation with the cas(50,67 ) for chloroiron corrole employing the ci - deas guess and @xmath29 with 8 sweeps requires a couple of hours of computational time on 16 cores of an intel xeon e5 - 2670 central processing unit and gives reliable entanglement information .",
    "this entanglement information then allows for an automated active orbital space selection shown in the following sections so that the benefit more than outweighs the additional computational cost . in general , the entanglement measures from partially converged dmrg calculations closely resemble the converged results so that an active space selection based on these approximate calculations is justified .",
    "we now define criteria based on entanglement information for the automated selection of compact active orbital spaces .",
    "highly entangled orbitals are essential to construct a reliable zeroth - order wave function in a cas approach and must be included in the active orbital space.@xcite the single - orbital entropy and the maximum value of the mutual information serve as measures for the degree of entanglement of individual orbitals .",
    "+ global selection thresholds can be defined , for example , as a fraction of the theoretical maximum values ( e.g. , @xmath32 in a spatial - orbital basis with four possible occupations ) . to account for the varying degree of orbital entanglement in different molecules ,",
    "however , we choose our selection criteria with respect to the maximum value of the single - orbital entropy and mutual information obtained from the same calculation rather than with respect to the theoretical maximum .",
    "this ensures transferability of the threshold as the degree of entanglement strongly varies with the molecule and the orbital basis under consideration . a global selection threshold defined as a fraction of the theoretical maximum",
    "can still be advantageous in a first step to decide whether a molecule requires a multi - configuration ansatz or whether a single - configuration method is applicable .",
    "the electronic structure of all molecules considered here was found to be of multi - configurational character in previous works ( cited below ) .",
    "we analyzed the maximum single - orbital entropies for all molecules and orbital bases in order to find a threshold that identifies all these cases as multi - configurational . from this , we conclude that a conservative global threshold of @xmath33 for at least one orbital indicates the multi - configurational character of a wave function and includes even borderline cases like the crf@xmath3 complex discussed below .",
    "for the final active space , we then select all orbitals whose single - orbital entropy is higher than a fraction of the maximum value found for one of the @xmath19 in the calculation under consideration .",
    "this fraction is dynamically determined for each calculation as described below .",
    "a threshold based on the maximum element of the mutual information matrix is also investigated .",
    "we choose the permanganate ion to illustrate the approach , because it is a difficult molecule for electronic structure calculations despite its small size .",
    "a suitable active space for mno@xmath1 was under debate for some time and the general rules for the active orbital space selection mentioned in the introduction had to be extended for this covalently bonded transition - metal complex.@xcite all four different types of starting orbitals  hf , split - localized , casscf orbitals from a small cas(10,10)-scf calculation and partially converged dmrg - scf orbitals from the whole valence space  are considered .    ]",
    "-scf orbitals of the mno@xmath1 ion . on the @xmath34-axis ,",
    "the orbital selection threshold is given as a fraction of the maximal value for each calculation . ]    for the identification of a reliable threshold for the orbital selection we apply threshold diagrams as shown in figure [ thresh_mno4 ] .",
    "on the @xmath34-axis the orbital discarding threshold is varied from 0 to 100  % of the largest element of either the single - orbital entropy or the mutual information matrix , while the number of selected orbitals according to that threshold is displayed on the @xmath35-axis .",
    "a threshold of 0  % then leads to a selection of all orbitals ( here 25 orbitals on the left of each diagram in figure [ thresh_mno4 ] ) , whereas a threshold of 100  % of the maximum element ( on the right of each diagram in figure [ thresh_mno4 ] ) selects no orbital for the final converged calculation .",
    "the threshold diagrams contain in general one or more plateaus ( defined as a slope of zero over a threshold range of at least 10  % ) that identify subsets of orbitals with similar degree of entanglement . in the threshold diagram for hf orbitals ( upper left panel of figure [ thresh_mno4 ] ) for example",
    ", a subset of 17 orbitals has single - orbital entropies of at least 30  % of the maximum @xmath19 value ( right end of the first plateau ) and only when the threshold is lowered to less than 5  % ( left end of the first plateau ) more orbitals ( all 25 ) are selected .    in the same threshold diagram",
    ", the mutual information threshold leads to a different plateau with only ten orbitals .",
    "the set of 17 orbitals is identical to the active orbital space recommended in the literature , whereas a cas with only ten orbitals was considered insufficient.@xcite since the mutual information threshold in general leads to plateaus with a lower  and in this case insufficient  number of orbitals , we conclude that a threshold based on the single - orbital entropy is more reliable and will focus on this in the following .",
    "the correct cas evolves here naturally from the discarding threshold that is dynamically determined from the plateaus in the single - orbital entropy threshold diagrams for all four types of orbitals .",
    "the definition of this threshold is , however , less clear for the cas(10,10)-scf orbitals ( lower left diagram of figure [ thresh_mno4 ] ) , where no plateaus can be identified .",
    "the small cas chosen for the generation of these orbitals includes ten orbitals around the fermi level . in this case , it is possible to exclude eight orbitals with very small single - orbital entropy , leaving the same 17 orbitals in the final active space as for the other types of orbitals .",
    "interestingly , the ten orbitals of the initial cas do not give rise to a plateau in the threshold diagram and we may conclude that orbitals from a small cas calculation do not introduce a bias towards the initial active orbitals .",
    "this indicates that the choice of orbitals to be included in the active space is arbitrary to some degree , because even orbitals from a cas known to be insufficient lead to the selection of the correct set of active orbitals in an automated approach .    from the threshold diagrams in figure [ thresh_mno4 ] and those in the following sections we can identify two different entanglement patterns :",
    "whenever plateaus occur in the diagrams , highly entangled orbitals that have to be _ included _ in the final active space can be identified , whereas weakly entangled orbitals will be _ excluded _ if no such plateaus are present .    based on these results , we propose the following protocol for orbital selection from the initial , exploratory large - cas dmrg calculation that is now solely based on the single - orbital entropy depicted in figure [ flowchart ] :    1 .",
    "we will assign a multi - configuration character of the wave function if at least one single - orbital entropy is higher than 0.14 .",
    "if we observe a plateau structure in the threshold diagrams , the corresponding highly entangled orbitals will be identified and included in the final active space .",
    "if no plateau structure is observed ( as is the case for the cas(10,10)-scf orbitals in mno@xmath1 ) , we will exclude orbitals whose single - orbital entropy is lower than 1 - 2  % of the maximum single - orbital entropy .",
    "if all orbitals are to be selected , an even larger cas is selected for the initial dmrg calculation to probe whether additional orbitals are required for the final cas .",
    "a comparison of the entanglement information extracted from the converged selected - cas calculation with that of the initial calculation allows us to assess the consistency of the selection procedure .",
    "apart from the initial orbital generation all steps are automated . a selection based on a fixed threshold",
    "may also be applied . from the results above ,",
    "a threshold of 10  % of the maximum @xmath36-value would lead to the same active orbital selection as the procedure introduced above ( for all types of orbitals ) .",
    "we emphasize that we define our selection protocol based on a comparison to active spaces recommended in the literature . that this protocol yields reliable results for , e.g. , relative energies will be demonstrated in sections [ salen ] and [ copper ] .",
    "figure [ thresh_mno4 ] further suggests that all types of orbitals studied here are equally suited for the entanglement based selection of active orbital spaces . in the following ,",
    "however , we do not further consider hf and split - localized orbitals .",
    "the delocalized nature of the former makes a preselection of orbitals hard for large molecules and can also lead to slow dmrg convergence in the final calculation .",
    "the latter type of orbitals overcomes this issue but at the expense of loosing point - group symmetry so that calculations are computationally more demanding .",
    "moreover , the localization procedure is not always straightforward , especially for the virtual orbitals .",
    "hence , we focus on casscf orbitals from a minimal cas and on partially converged dmrg - scf orbitals in the following .",
    "the latter proved to be valuable in cases where the initial cas did not exceed 40 orbitals as shown in the following sections .",
    "note that the generation of these orbitals took less than a day ( on 16 cores of an intel xeon e5 - 2670 central processing unit ) in the worst case of cu@xmath5o@xmath6 with 36 orbitals .",
    "the degree of covalency in the metal - ligand bonds heavily affects the number of orbitals to be included in the active space .",
    "this was demonstrated in the case of the chromium hexafluoro complex , where a change of the total charge changes the degree of covalency of the coordination bonds.@xcite while the bonds in the trianionic species crf@xmath3 are almost purely ionic , the neutral species crf@xmath2 is highly covalent .",
    "this is reflected in the natural orbital occupation numbers ( noons ) of restricted active - space scf ( rasscf ) orbitals,@xcite where the noons of all 23 valence orbitals in the neutral complex differ significantly from 2 and 0 for occupied and unoccupied orbitals , respectively .    based on these rasscf occupation numbers , the authors of ref .",
    "conclude that a suitable choice for the active space of the neutral complex comprises all 23 valence orbitals , while a cas(13,10 ) including the whole set of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and their anti - bonding counterparts is a valid choice for the anionic complex .",
    "the latter suggestion , however , is hard to confirm based on the occupation numbers alone , because all orbitals are either fully occupied or unoccupied , as can be seen from the rasscf data of table [ occnum_crf6 ] . to investigate whether our entanglement based selection criteria reflect the degree of covalency , we performed dmrg(@xmath8,23)[@xmath39-scf calculations for both the trianionic ( @xmath8 = 39 ) and the neutral ( @xmath40 ) species .    ):",
    "entanglement diagrams for all 23 dmrg(@xmath8,23)[@xmath39-scf valence orbitals of crf@xmath3 ( @xmath41 ) and crf@xmath2 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "lower panel : single - orbital entropy threshold diagrams for the determination of the number of orbitals to be included in the active space . ]    as can be seen from figure [ crf6_fig ] , the orbital entanglement is significantly different for both species . while in the anionic complex only the set of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 orbitals shows a significant degree of entanglement , all orbitals are highly entangled in the neutral species .",
    "the completely different degree of entanglement is clearly reflected in the single - orbital entropy threshold diagrams in the lower panel of figure [ crf6_fig ] . for the anionic complex , the number of orbitals with a high single - orbital entropy drops at very low fractions of the largest value and is then constant over a large range .",
    "the threshold diagram in the lower left corner of figure [ crf6_fig ] shows two extended plateaus that would allow one to choose two different cas .",
    "we therefore identify a set of ten orbitals with up to 80 % of the highest single - orbital entropy and may select either these orbitals ( as previously proposed ) or a slightly larger set of 13 orbitals considering the first plateau at low thresholds . in view of the ( second ) plateau at higher fractions of the maximum @xmath19 value extending over a large threshold range , the set of ten orbitals is chosen to yield a compact cas .",
    "note , however , that plateaus at very high thresholds would , in general , select too few orbitals and can therefore be safely discarded . from the molecules investigated in this study",
    "we deduce that plateaus in threshold diagrams are only meaningful up to a threshold of 60  % .",
    "the entanglement information pattern is totally different for the neutral complex , where no such plateau is observed in the threshold diagrams . according to the selection protocol",
    ", we attempt to exclude all orbitals with a single - orbital entropy of less than 1 - 2  % of the highest value in this case .",
    "since this does not apply to any of the orbitals , we consequently have to select all 23 valence orbitals , exactly as proposed in ref . .",
    "a comparison with selection criteria based on noons can be made in view of the data in table [ occnum_crf6 ] .",
    "the dmrg - scf noons suggest to choose the same set of orbitals as the entanglement based selection for both complexes , while the rasscf noons would erroneously make the anionic species a case suitable for single - reference methods .",
    "therefore , dmrg - scf noons will lead to the same conclusions as those drawn from the entanglement information for both complexes with similar constitution but very different electronic structure .",
    ".noons for the anionic and neutral crf@xmath2 complexes obtained from dmrg[@xmath39-scf calculations and rasscf results taken from ref . .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ methods_comp ]    clearly , the cas(16,14)-scf energy is qualitatively wrong , while the raspt2 result obtained for an active space size of 24 electrons in 28 orbitals is much closer to the cr - ccsd(tq)@xmath44 data.@xcite unfortunately , no rasscf values are reported in ref .   so that an estimate of the effect of dynamical correlation is not possible .",
    "it is remarkable , however , that the energy difference gradually increases with the inclusion of more virtual orbitals in the active space .",
    "the fact that the largest cas result ( 35.6 kcal / mol ) almost coincides with the best estimate energy difference ( 34.0 kcal / mol ) that includes dynamical correlation is not necessarily a sign of the validity of the approach to apply increasingly large cass .",
    "it might well be that even larger active spaces result in an even larger energy gap because of an imbalanced and partial treatment of the dynamical correlation .",
    "the simple addition of more virtual orbitals is a procedure unlikely to be successful when it comes to calculations on large molecules because the ability of dmrg to also capture dynamic correlation will be limited to the growing number of orbitals in the cas .    in this section",
    ", we determined a consistent and compact active space capable to describe the energy along an isomerization coordinate of cu@xmath5o@xmath6 from our automated approach .",

    "we showed that suitable active orbital spaces can automatically be selected based on the orbital entanglement information of partially converged dmrg calculations with a large number of active orbitals around the fermi level .",
    "a tailored cas can then be established that allows a casscf or dmrg calculation to cover all essential static electron correlation effects , while neglecting weakly entangled orbitals that would introduce arbitrary amounts of dynamic electron correlation into the cas .",
    "partial convergence and a small number of renormalized block states are required to quickly assess the entanglement pattern among the orbitals in the large cas . with this approach",
    ", we were able to reproduce active spaces for molecules identified and discussed in the literature as complicated cases . by comparison with active spaces recommended in the literature",
    ", we concluded that the single - orbital entropy provides a more reliable selection criterion than the mutual information .",
    "our approach relies on the advantages of dmrg to handle large active spaces and to obtain a qualitatively converged wave function after few iterations .",
    "calculations with the selected active space can then be fully converged .",
    "the selection protocol itself can be summarized as follows : after an initial investigation of the multi - configurational character of the wave function , subsets of highly entangled orbitals are identified by automated inspection of threshold diagrams . in cases",
    "where no subsets can be identified , orbitals with a very low single - orbital entropy are automatically excluded from the final active orbital space .",
    "the quality of the final cas can be assessed by a comparison of the entanglement information of the final calculation with that of the initial calculation . +",
    "this automated approach has the potential to overcome the extremely tedious and error prone step of cas selection in multi - reference calculations .",
    "if the final cas is small , also traditional methods can be applied so that the truncation error of dmrg does not affect the final result .    in all those cases considered in this study ( sections [ chrome ] and [ salen ] ) , where previous authors applied noon based selection criteria ( or justified their choice of cas with noons ) we did not find a contradiction to our entanglement based active orbital selection if dmrg noons are considered . an occupation number",
    "based orbital selection , however , relies on a global threshold  usually orbitals with ons between 0.02 and 1.98 are selected  which is not flexible with respect to the degree of static correlation present in a molecule .",
    "we attempt to overcome this inflexibility by coupling the determination of the orbital discarding threshold to the maximum @xmath19 value of a given calculation .",
