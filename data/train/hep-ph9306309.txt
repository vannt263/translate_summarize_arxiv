    "the standard model of particle physics is extraordinarily successful , describing all known properties of the elementary particles in terms of just 18 free parameters .",
    "nevertheless , the model leaves so many questions unanswered that numerous ideas and speculations leading toward a more fundamental theory have been developed .",
    "while there is no hard evidence to support any of these speculations , experiments have provided some hints . in particular",
    ", the only parameter of the standard model that has been successfully predicted with a high level of significance is the weak mixing angle , which is a prediction of supersymmetric grand unified theories ( susy guts ) @xcite .",
    "while this is just a single parameter , the excellent agreement of data with the simplest susy gut suggests that it is worthwhile to pursue other predictions of similar susy guts .",
    "this is harder than it sounds .",
    "the reason is that the weak mixing angle has a unique status within these theories : it is the only parameter which can be predicted by knowing only the gauge group structure of the model .",
    "in fact all one needs to know @xcite is that the gauge group is , or breaks to , su(5 ) @xcite .",
    "all other predictions require additional , model - dependent information about the theory .",
    "a good example of this is the proton decay rate : it can only be computed after making an assumption about the spectrum of the superheavy colored states . it is a very interesting quantity , since the simplest possible structure for this superheavy spectrum gives a decay rate that may well be accessible to planned experimental searches .",
    "nevertheless , only minor changes in the theory can lead to very large suppression factors in the rate .",
    "a potentially copious source of predictions is the flavor sector , responsible for the quark and lepton masses and mixings .",
    "an early success of guts was the prediction of the bottom quark to tau lepton mass ratio , @xmath7 @xcite ; however , several considerations make this less impressive than the weak mixing angle prediction .",
    "first and foremost is the low numerical significance of the @xmath7 prediction : it can not be made with much accuracy as long as the strong coupling @xmath8 and the top quark yukawa coupling ( which can not be neglected for a heavy top ) are not known very well , and it can not be compared accurately with experiment without better knowledge of @xmath9 .",
    "this low significance is especially troubling given that the theory is predicting only one of the 13 independent flavor parameters of the standard model .",
    "nevertheless , with a heavy top quark , an acceptable value of @xmath7 _ requires _ more than one light higgs doublet  which provides another interesting hint pointing towards low - energy supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "finally , the simplest flavor sector which leads to this prediction immediately fails when extended to the lighter generations : @xmath10 is unacceptable . to overcome these objections",
    "it is necessary to construct a more complicated flavor sector of the grand unified theory .",
    "here there is a delicate balance : more structure requires further assumptions , but these are perhaps justified if there are additional predictions .",
    "this approach was developed long ago @xcite and has received considerable attention recently @xcite . using the full power of the grand unified group so(10 ) @xcite it is possible to obtain predictions for 7 of the 13 flavor parameters .",
    "further development of the flavor sector can also lead to predictions for neutrino masses @xcite . despite these successes ,",
    "one still has to admit that these schemes are based on the hope that the flavor sector at the grand unified scale is particularly simple : the quark and lepton masses must originate in just a few grand unified interactions .",
    "if there are many such interactions the predictions are lost .",
    "this is a particularly acute problem for the lighter generations .",
    "the smallness of these masses can be understood if they arise from higher dimensional operators .",
    "however in this case there is a very large number of operators that could be written down , and the restriction that just one or two of these operators contribute to the masses involves some strong assumptions .",
    "we are unable to completely avoid this dilemma : to obtain quark and lepton mass predictions from grand unified theories , assumptions about the underlying flavor structure of the theory must be made .",
    "of all the flavor predictions of guts those pertaining to the heaviest generation are most direct and subject to the fewest assumptions . in this paper",
    "we pursue a scheme for predicting the top mass which is unique in its simplicity .",
    "we attempt as complete and accurate analysis of this prediction as possible : the aim is to predict the top quark mass to within a few gev .",
    "there are many approaches in the literature which result in predictions for the top mass .",
    "we would like to emphasize the differences between two such approaches and a third one which we shall take .",
    "the first is the infrared fixed point behaviour of the renormalization group ( rg ) equation for the top quark yukawa coupling @xcite .",
    "this is an argument that certain values for the top mass are more probable than others if all gut scale yukawa couplings are equally probable .",
    "the second framework for predicting the top quark mass is that of textures for the generation structure of the yukawa coupling matrices .",
    "the top mass is given in terms of lighter quark masses and entries of the kobayashi - maskawa mixing matrix @xcite .",
    "this necessarily requires assumptions about the masses of the lighter generations . finally , in the context of grand unified theories , it is sometimes possible to predict the top quark mass from a consideration only of the heaviest generation , with the b and @xmath2 masses as inputs from experiment @xcite . consider the yukawa interactions of a supersymmetric grand unified theory which lead to masses for the heaviest generation .",
    "there are three observable masses : @xmath4 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "since the higgs doublet which leads to the top mass is forced by supersymmetry to be different from the one which gives mass to b and @xmath2 , these three masses necessarily depend on the parameter @xmath12 , the ratio of the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of these two doublets .",
    "if the grand unified theory has two or more independent yukawa parameters contributing to the heaviest generation masses , then there will be no prediction when the heavy generation is considered in isolation .",
    "the only possibility for a prediction resulting from consideration of the heaviest generation alone is that the t , b and @xmath2 masses originate predominantly from a single yukawa interaction .",
    "this immediately excludes the grand unified gauge group su(5 ) from consideration @xcite .",
    "the simplest supersymmetric @xcite grand unified gauge group which allows relations between masses in the up and down sectors is so(10 ) .    in this paper",
    "we study the top quark mass prediction which results from the following three assumptions :    1 .",
    "the masses of the third generation , @xmath4 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 , originate from renormalizable yukawa couplings of the form @xmath3 in a supersymmetric gut with a gauge group containing ( the conventional ) so(10 ) .",
    "2 .   the evolution of the gauge and yukawa couplings in the effective theory beneath the so(10 ) breaking scale is described by the rg equations of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "the two higgs doublets lie predominantly in a single irreducible multiplet of so(10 ) .",
    "we find it highly significant that such simple and mild assumptions are sufficient for predicting the top quark mass with an accuracy of a few gev , in terms of a few parameters of the mssm ( which could be measured experimentally ) . in secs .",
    "vii we in fact assume that the two light higgs doublets lie completely in a single irreducible multiplet , while in sec .",
    "ix we return to the effects of mixing with other multiplets .",
    "we will very rapidly be led to the result that the so(10 ) multiplet containing the higgs doublets is ( almost ) necessarily the @xmath13 , so that the relevant yukawa interaction is @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is the third - generation matter supermultiplet ) .",
    "the prediction of the top quark mass from this interaction was first considered by ananthanarayan , lazarides and shafi @xcite .",
    "we find the picture which emerges from such an interaction to be very elegant . while the three yukawa couplings @xmath16 are different at low energies , they evolve according to rg equations to a common unified value at the large mass scale of the grand unified theory . the scenario is reminiscent of the evolution of the three gauge coupling constants to a common value at the unification scale .",
    "while the gauge coupling unification leads to a prediction for the weak mixing angle , the yukawa coupling unification leads to a prediction for the top quark mass .",
    "the top - bottom mass hierarchy then originates in the higgs sector , so another prediction is a large ratio of higgs vevs .",
    "the weak mixing angle prediction has undergone several refinements as higher order corrections and a variety of threshold corrections have been considered .",
    "an aim of the present paper is to compute such corrections to the top mass prediction to a similar level of accuracy .",
    "in particular we study :    * the coupled two - loop rg equations for the three gauge couplings and the three yukawa couplings .",
    "we give an analytic fit to the numerical results which is valid to better than @xmath17 . * some implications of generating the top - bottom mass hierarchy through a large ratio of the vevs of the two light higgs doublets .",
    "this source for up - down mass hierarchy is generic in models which unify all three yukawa couplings of the third generation . since _",
    "a priori _ there is no symmetry protecting the down - type higgs vev and consequently the down - type fermion masses , large radiative corrections to these masses typically arise and change the top mass prediction considerably .",
    "such corrections will be suppressed if the squarks are much heavier than the higgsinos and gauginos ; indeed , we identify two symmetries which could then protect the down - type vev and masses . whether such suppression is favored in models with large @xmath5",
    "is a question for future study @xcite , and whether it is the case in nature will be determined by future experiments . *",
    "two consequences of these large corrections to the b quark mass . for a certain range of mssm parameters",
    "the @xmath18 prediction can not be brought into agreement with experiment ; for a separate , smaller range , different gut - scale boundary conditions must be used .",
    "* the supersymmetric threshold corrections to the three gauge couplings and the three yukawa couplings .",
    "these are given for an arbitrary spectrum of the superpartners of the minimal supersymmetric standard model , ignoring only the electroweak breaking effects in the spectrum .",
    "we find in particular that , when the above symmetries hold approximately , raising any or all of the superpartner masses increases @xmath4 for fixed @xmath19 . * threshold corrections at the grand unified mass scale .",
    "we show that such corrections to the gauge couplings do not significantly affect the top mass prediction for a given @xmath19 .",
    "we calculate the corrections to the yukawa couplings from superheavy splittings in the gauge , the @xmath13 and the @xmath15 multiplets ( these corrections are not very large ) , and give general expressions for further possible superheavy threshold corrections . * the extent to which the predicted value of the top quark mass depends on assumption ( iii ) .",
    "this assumption is , in our opinion , the weakest part of the theoretical picture which underlies the top mass prediction ( with the possible exception of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector ) . even if the third generation only couples through a single so(10 ) invariant yukawa interaction , the relation between this coupling and the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 renormalized at the unification scale may involve a set of mixing angles describing which two linear combinations of the doublets of the unified theory are light .",
    "an understanding of these mixing angles is in principle related to an understanding of why two doublets remain light ( the doublet - triplet splitting problem ) .",
    "our understanding of the resolution of this problem is at present not complete .",
    "we are however greatly encouraged by the following two facts : _ i _ ) due to the fixed point behavior of the rge the prediction is somewhat insensitive to these mixing angles in a large class of models ; _ ii _ ) in very simple so(10 ) models which provide a partial solution of the doublet - triplet splitting problem , both higgs doublets are in fact contained within the same irreducible representation ( namely a @xmath13 ) @xcite .",
    "* the extraction of the @xmath1 quark mass from experiment , using updated experimental information and including the dependence of the extracted value of this mass on the qcd coupling @xmath8 .",
    "this is of importance to us because the two crucial experimental inputs to the top mass prediction are @xmath9 and @xmath8 .    in sec .",
    "ii we describe the basic framework for our calculation .",
    "a discussion of the implications of large @xmath5 is given in sec .",

    "iv we give approximate analytic solutions to the two loop renormalization group equations , in the absence of threshold corrections .",
    "the extraction of the b quark mass from data is given in sec .",
    "v. armed with this experimental value of @xmath9 , we return in sec .  vi to the large corrections to the predicted @xmath9 , bounding these corrections ( and consequently the mssm parameters ) and investigating the possibility of different gut - scale initial conditions for the yukawa couplings .",

    "furthermore , a supersymmetric theory without mixing terms in the lagrangian is technically natural , due to the nonrenormalization theorems . then either @xmath58 , in which case the initial conditions for the yukawa couplings are = = , [ eqinitcond ] or else @xmath59 from whence @xmath60 . in the second case",

    "in fact , the only option for perturbative unification with @xmath59 is for very large electroweak - scale threshold corrections to arise , which are of just the right magnitude and sign to restore the agreement of @xmath7 with experiment . only for a very limited range of @xmath65 values and mssm parameters",

    "how , and indeed whether , the various parameter values may arise will be discussed in a future paper @xcite .    at tree level ,",
    "an appropriate choice of parameters in the scalar potential leads to @xmath73 and hence to @xmath82 .",
    "however , no symmetry has ( yet ) been imposed on the lagrangian to protect such a hierarchy , and therefore we expect large radiative corrections",

    "what extent does the analysis , and the resulting top quark mass predictions , remain valid when the higgs doublets have components in other irreducible representations ? in general",
    "there will be a set of mixing angles @xmath460 and @xmath461 describing the components of the two light higgs doublets , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , in various so(10 ) multiplets ( @xmath13 , @xmath54 , or some other representation ) labeled by @xmath462 .",
    "suppose for now that the third generation masses are generated by a set of yukawa interactions which are all of the form @xmath463 , where the @xmath464 are a subset of the @xmath465 .",
    "in this case the gut boundary condition @xmath466 will occur regardless of the values of @xmath460 and @xmath461 ; on the other hand , @xmath467 if @xmath468 for any @xmath469 .",
    "the analysis of this paper still applies to this situation provided an additional term @xmath470 is added to @xmath314 to reflect this change in boundary condition . as we saw above , the fixed - point behavior implies a considerable insensitivity to @xmath314 ( see the corresponding sensitivity function @xmath471 ) .",
    "typically @xmath472 so for @xmath473 the shift in the top mass is less than 5 gev .",
    "( this is not necessarily an uncertainty : in a given model the mixings are computable and so is the top mass shift . )",
    "this shows that our results apply even when several @xmath14 interactions contribute to the third generation masses and @xmath38 and @xmath39 have sizeable components in different @xmath13 multiplets .",
    "a particularly interesting subclass of the above models contains just one pair of @xmath474 s , of which only one , @xmath475 , couples to the @xmath476 .",
    "the @xmath477 is introduced to make the triplets in @xmath478 heavy .",
    "this is achieved while keeping the doublets light via the coupling @xmath479 , provided the @xmath480 gets a vev in the @xmath481 direction @xcite .",
    "a more detailed discussion of a model of this type will be given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the restrictions on the values of @xmath482 are stricter when @xmath469 refers to a @xmath483 which couples via @xmath484 , because this leads to @xmath485 at the gut scale . using our analysis",
    "then requires an additional contribution to @xmath486 of order @xmath487 .",
    "shifts in @xmath4 of up to 10 gev occur when @xmath488 .",
    "we conclude that while @xmath38 and @xmath39 must lie predominantly in a single @xmath13 , they may have a certain amount of mixing with doublets in other multiplets , where the allowed mixing may be quite large if the other multiplet is a @xmath13 but must be small if it is a @xmath54 with a significant coupling to the third generation .",
    "another contribution to @xmath426 may arise from operators of the form @xmath489 which mix the second and third generations .",
    "such operators must be present in order to generate @xmath490 ; in fact , @xmath491 must have sufficient structure to give different values for the ( 2,3 ) entries of the up and down yukawa matrices .",
    "this implies a non - universal contribution to @xmath426 .",
    "normally the contribution is of order @xmath492 , which hardly affects the top quark mass prediction .",
    "however , if in some scheme ( see , for example , the last reference in @xcite ) the operator @xmath489 is responsible for generating a sizable fraction of @xmath493 and @xmath494 [ rather than having these generated by the ( 2,2 ) entries of the yukawa matrices ] then the contribution to @xmath495 could be large .",
    "for example , if there is _ no _ operator of the form @xmath496 to give a mass to the muon or the strange quark , then we would expect @xmath497 , which would lead to a shift in @xmath4 of @xmath498 .",
    "this extreme case is however unnatural since such schemes will not lead to an understanding of why @xmath499 ; in any case , the shift in such schemes is calculable and does not introduce much uncertainty into the prediction of the top mass .",
    "in this paper we have computed the top quark mass in supersymmetric so(10 ) grand unified theories including all contributions larger than about 5 gev . the assumption underlying",
    "this computation is that @xmath4 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 all originate from a single yukawa interaction with an so(10 ) multiplet which dominantly contains the two low energy higgs doublets .",
    "while this is a somewhat restrictive assumption , it has certain virtues .",
    "it seems to us to be the simplest assumption , within grand unified theories , which can lead to a top mass prediction in terms of low energy quantities .",
    "in particular it does not involve any ansatz about the origin of masses for the lighter two generations .",
    "furthermore this assumption leads to an almost unique group - theoretic structure which underlies the top mass prediction : except for a narrow range of ( measurable ) mssm parameters , the yukawa interaction must be of the form @xmath14 .",
    "the top mass prediction which results from the unification of the three third - generation yukawa interactions recalls the prediction of the weak mixing angle which follows from the unification of the three gauge couplings .",
    "there is however an important difference between these two cases , having to do with threshold effects at the susy scale . in the gauge case",
    "these effects consist of a renormalization of _ only one _ operator ( the gauge kinetic term ) , and are therefore small as long as the theory is perturbative .",
    "in contrast , there are two possible yukawa interaction operators below the susy scale , corresponding to the two higgs doublets , that contribute to the mass of each fermion once these doublets acquire vevs .",
    "thus a hierarchy of vevs could result in large threshold corrections to the lighter masses without necessarily invalidating perturbation theory .",
    "such a hierarchy is actually mandated in the so(10 ) unification under our assumptions , and results in another contrast with previous unification scenarios , specifically the partial yukawa unification in su(5 )",
    ". a crucial outcome of the gut boundary condition @xmath466 is that the resulting value of @xmath7 can only be reconciled with experiment if the top quark yukawa coupling is large .",
    "this is why in su(5 ) and in so(10 ) models the top quark is predicted to be heavy . in the former ,",
    "the ratio of @xmath500 at the gut scale is an arbitrary parameter , which thus precludes a prediction of @xmath4 .",
    "the so(10 ) gut boundary condition fixes @xmath500 to be unity ; however , we are forced to take @xmath501 to account for @xmath502 , and hence large susy threshold effects introduce a new parameter @xmath95 into the top mass prediction .",
    "this feature of so(10 ) is an improvement over su(5 ) : now the undetermined parameter is a ratio of observable mass parameters , which is measurable in principle by future experiments , rather than a ratio of vevs which will be more difficult to deduce . furthermore , if we assume a hierarchical structure in the susy spectrum ( a discussion of such a structure will be presented elsewhere @xcite ) in which the sfermions are considerably heavier than gauginos and higgsinos , there are indeed no large threshold effects and the top mass is sharply predicted .    with these caveats in mind , and choosing the hierarchical spectrum ,",
    "our basic results are shown in fig .  3 and table i , and are approximated by eq .",
    "( [ eqmtappr ] ) and table ii .",
    "these show the dependence of the predicted top quark pole mass on @xmath8 and @xmath9 and the dominant superpartner spectrum effects . unless future experiments find a value for @xmath8 below the range shown in the figure , the hierarchical spectrum predicts a top quark heavier than @xmath503 to within 5 gev or so .",
    "( of course , various uncertainties could pile up and result in a lower top mass , but this is unlikely . ) a smaller experimental value for @xmath4 would indicate that @xmath95 is considerable ; measuring the various mssm mass parameters could then test this so(10 ) unification scenario as outlined at the end of sec .",
    "vi . more generally , our prediction reads @xmath504 $ ] where @xmath505 , @xmath197 and the sensitivity functions @xmath506 and @xmath507 are shown in fig .",
    "2 , the @xmath326 and the @xmath321 are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eqeps1]-[eqktau ] ) , and @xmath508 \\left(\\eta_\\tau / \\eta_b\\right ) \\left[1-\\alpha_3(\\mu_z)/3\\pi\\right ] \\left[1 + f_r(m_a)\\right]$ ] . in any specific mssm - based gut model in which @xmath509 , both the possible contributions of the diagrams in fig .  1 and any further deviations from the equality of gut - scale yukawa couplings can be calculated and inserted into the above expressions .",
    "these then yield an analytic prediction of the top mass to within a few gev  which is more than sufficient for comparison with top mass measurements likely to be made in the near future .",
