    "the four color problem , or guthrie s problem , asks whether any planar map can be colored using four shades so that no neighboring regions share the same color .",
    "after a rich , long and notorious history , the problem was finally solved by appel and haken in 1976  @xcite .",
    "they reduced the problem to @xmath3 cases which they checked by computer . in 1996 ,",
    "robertson , sanders , seymour and thomas presented a new proof where the computer only had to go through @xmath4 cases  @xcite . in this work",
    ", we do not worry about the existence of a coloring but rather about how different colorings are related . to this purpose",
    ", we introduce the concept of weak hamiltonian .",
    "weak hamiltonians are a loosened form of hamiltonians in planar cubic graphs and we show how they are actually equivalent to four colorings .",
    "weak hamiltonian also have extra structure in form of mutations : each weak hamiltonian can be transformed in two or more different weak hamiltonians .",
    "mutations endow the set of weak hamiltonians of a graph structure ( the weak hamiltonian graph , @xmath0 ) and , hereby , the set of colorings of a graph structure , the chromatic graph @xmath1 .",
    "these graphs are the natural framework to discuss problems such as which graphs admit a unique four coloring ( see  @xcite for related discussions ) .      as in lando and zvonkin  @xcite , we define a * map * as a graph embedded on an oriented surface .",
    "in particular , all edges incident to a same vertex admit a natural cyclic order . moreover , we request that our maps be bridgeless .",
    "otherwise , we mainly use the language of diestel  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we simply require our maps to be cubic ( i.e. all vertices have degree @xmath5 ) .    a *",
    "weak hamiltonian * is a 2-factor all of whose cycles have even length .",
    "we will call * weakly hamiltonian * a graph which admits a weak hamilton cycle . in particular , all hamiltonian cubic graphs are weakly hamiltonian as they have an even number of vertices ( the number of half edges ) .",
    "the converse is not true : not all weakly hamiltonian graphs are hamiltonian .",
    "note that there are graphs , such as the biclique @xmath6  or , for that matter , any graph with an odd number of vertices ",
    ", which are neither hamiltonian , nor weakly hamiltonian .",
    "let @xmath7 be a weak hamilton cycle on @xmath8 and @xmath9 its cycles . for each cycle @xmath10 pick a 1-factor @xmath11 .",
    "the complement of a weak hamiltonian @xmath12 is a 1-factor of the original map which we denote by @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath14 * mutation * of @xmath12 is the map @xmath15 obtained by taking the union of the @xmath11 and @xmath13 .",
    "consider the prism graph @xmath16 with the weak hamiltonian consisting of the internal and external cycles  see figure  [ fig : wham ] .",
    "we pick as 1-factors on each cycle the dashed edges .",
    "the mutated weak hamiltonian is the one on the right of the figure .",
    ", @xmath17 are represented as dashed edges in the center and , the mutated weak hamiltonian is on the right.,title=\"fig:\",height=56 ]    [ lem : freecycle ] any mutation of a weak hamiltonian is a weak hamiltonian .",
    "it is clear that the mutation is a 2-factor as the criterion is local .",
    "moreover all cycles are even since the mutation consists of alternating edges coming from @xmath13 and the @xmath11 .",
    "it follows directly from the definition that    given any cubic map : [ pro : properties ]    1 .",
    "a map is the union of a weak hamiltonian and one of its mutations .",
    "2 .   each weak hamiltonian with @xmath18 cycles admits @xmath19 mutations .",
    "3 .   a weak hamiltonian @xmath7 can mutate to @xmath20 iff @xmath20 can mutate to @xmath7 .",
    "note that this is not the first attempt to study the four color problem using modifications of the graph .",
    "however , in general it is the original graph that is deformed and not underlying structures . in particular , one often tries to reduce the graph by erasing and/or collapsing edges in a manner compatible with the computation of the chromatic polynomial . in the above construction ,",
    "the original graph remains unchanged , it is the weak hamiltonians which are transformed .",
    "the first part of this section is well known and shows why it is sufficient to consider cubic graphs when considering 4 colorability .",
    "we include it as the proof has a geometric flavor and , also , as the usual argument refers to the dual set up where colors are assigned to vertices . in the second part",
    "we show how the existence of a four coloring is equivalent to the existence of a weak hamiltonian .",
    "recall that a map is a graph embedded on a oriented surface .",
    "we think of the faces as _ regions _ and of the edges as _",
    "boundaries_. an * @xmath21-coloring * of our map is function @xmath22 from the set of faces of the graph to the set @xmath23 such that no two neighboring regions have the same image .",
    "the * blowup * of the map @xmath8 at a vertex @xmath24 is the map @xmath25 where @xmath24 is replaced by one vertex per incident edge and a collection of edges joining the new vertices in a cycle oriented as the original edges .     and its blowup.,title=\"fig:\",height=56 ]",
    "let @xmath8 be a map , its * resolution * @xmath26 is the successive blowup at all points of degree @xmath2 or higher .",
    "note that the resolution is well defined .",
    "the blowup at a point reduces by one the number of vertices of degree at least @xmath2 and we are thus certain that the process terminates .",
    "moreover , since the blowup is a local construction , the order of the blowups does not matter .",
    "the following statement is classic , we have simply rephrased the proofs in terms of blow - ups :    all planar maps are four colorable if and only if all maps of degree @xmath5 are four colorable .",
    "one direction is immediate .",
    "assume now that all maps of degree @xmath5 are four colorable .",
    "let @xmath8 be a general map and @xmath26 its resolution .",
    "by hypothesis @xmath26 admits some @xmath2-colouring @xmath22 . for a face @xmath27 of @xmath8 , we write @xmath28 for the corresponding face on the resolution . define the function @xmath29 on the faces of @xmath8 as @xmath30 the map @xmath29 is a four coloring of @xmath8 as two faces @xmath31 and @xmath32 are neighbors if and only if @xmath33 and @xmath34 are .",
    "let us begin by recalling the the jordan curve theorem .",
    "the complement of a simple closed planar curve is made of two components .",
    "a simple closed planar curve is often called a * jordan curve*. a weak hamiltonian on a planar graph consists of a disjoint union of jordan curves .",
    "while there are now  priori more than @xmath35 regions , we have a milder version of the above theorem :    [ prop:2color ] a weak hamiltonian on a planar map @xmath8 is @xmath35-coloured map .",
    "let @xmath36 be a weak hamiltonian .",
    "each cycle @xmath37 defines an inside and an outside and hence a characteristic function @xmath38 assigning the value @xmath39 to points of its interior and @xmath40 on its exterior .",
    "the function @xmath22 defined by @xmath41 gives the requested @xmath35 coloring .",
    "[ thm : main ] a planar cubic map is @xmath2 colorable if and only if it admits a weak hamiltonian .    before we start , let us pick a bijection @xmath42 .",
    "+ assume the graph admits a weak hamiltonian @xmath43 . by lemma  [ lem : freecycle ]",
    ", there is another weak hamiltonian @xmath44 such that all edges belong to either one of these two cycles . by the proof of proposition  [ prop:2color ] , each cycle defines a @xmath35-coloring , say @xmath45 and @xmath46 , on the restricted graphs .",
    "define a @xmath2 coloring on the complete map as @xmath47 since each edge belongs either to @xmath43 or @xmath44 , we are guaranteed that distinct faces of the map are colored differently through @xmath48 .    conversely , assume the map is four colored by the function @xmath48 .",
    "define new functions @xmath49 with image in @xmath50 as @xmath51 where @xmath52 represents the projection of @xmath53 onto its i - th component .",
    "we can now define @xmath54 as union of the edges between regions of different color with respect to @xmath55 .",
    "+ to see that @xmath54 is a 2-factor , note that each vertex of the map has degree @xmath5 hence each @xmath55 , restricted to the three regions incident to a chosen vertex must be surjective .",
    "therefore , one of the the three regions has a different image under @xmath55 than the other @xmath35 regions .",
    "the edges of @xmath54 incident to the vertex are exactly the two edges bounding this region .",
    "+ pick a cycle in @xmath54 . given the orientation , we can talk about the inside bounded regions and the outside bounded regions .",
    "as the outside pointing edges belong to @xmath56 , the regions bounded outside of @xmath54 form a sequence of faces whose image alternates with respect to @xmath57 : they come in even number .",
    "the same holds for regions on the inside and we have thus that each cycle of @xmath54 has even length .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",height=56 ]    [ rmk : freedom ] in the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] , there is some arbitrariness in the choice of the bijection @xmath42 .",
    "actually , up to isomorphism , we can see that any coloring gives rise to 3 distinct weak hamiltonians , all of which are mutation of one another .",
    "in this section we use the notion of mutation to endow weak hamiltonians and , _ en passant _ , four colorings with a graph structure .",
