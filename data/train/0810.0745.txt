    "in wireless communication networks , multiple users often share a common channel and contend for access . to resolve the contention problem , many different medium access control ( mac ) protocols",
    "have been devised and used .",
    "recently , the selfish behavior of users in mac protocols has been studied using game theory",
    ". there have been attempts to understand the existing mac protocols as the local utility maximizing behavior of selfish users by reverse - engineering the current protocols ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it has also been investigated whether existing protocols are vulnerable to the existence of selfish users who pursue their self - interest in a non - cooperative manner .",
    "non - cooperative behavior often leads to inefficient outcomes .",
    "for example , in the 802.11 distributed mac protocol , dcf , and its enhanced version , edcf , competition among selfish users can lead to an inefficient use of the shared channel in nash equilibria @xcite .",
    "similarly , a prisoner s dilemma phenomenon arises in a non - cooperative game for a generalized version of slotted - aloha protocols @xcite .",
    "in general , if a game has nash equilibria yielding low payoffs for the players , it will be desirable for them to transform the game to extend the set of equilibria to include better outcomes @xcite .",
    "the same idea can be applied to the game played by selfish users who compete for access to a common medium . if competition among selfish users brings about a network collapse , then it is beneficial for them to design a device which provides incentives to behave cooperatively .",
    "game theory @xcite discusses three types of transformation : 1 ) games with contracts , 2 ) games with communication , and 3 ) repeated games .",
    "a game is said to be with contracts if the players of the game can communicate and bargain with each other , and enforce the agreement with a binding contract .",
    "the main obstacle to apply this approach to wireless networking is the distributed nature of wireless networks . to reach an agreement",
    ", users should know the network system and be able to communicate with each other .",
    "they should also be able to enforce the agreed plan .",
    "a game with communication is the one in which players can communicate with each other through a mediator but they can not write a binding contract . in this case , a correlated equilibrium is predicted to be played .",
    "@xcite studies correlated equilibria using a coordination mechanism in a slotted aloha - type scenario . unlike the first approach , this does not require that the actions of players be enforceable",
    ". however , to apply this approach to the medium access problem , signals need to be conveyed from a mediator to all users , and users need to know the correct meanings of the signals .",
    "a repeated game is a dynamic game in which the same game is played repeatedly by the same players over finite or infinite periods",
    ". repeated interactions among the same players enable them to sustain cooperation by punishing deviations in subsequent periods .",
    "a main challenge of applying the idea of repeated games to wireless networks is that the users should keep track of their past observations and be able to detect deviations and to coordinate their actions in order to punish deviating users .",
    "besides the three approaches above , another approach widely applied to communication networks is pricing @xcite .",
    "a central entity charges prices to users in order to control their utilization of the network .",
    "nash equilibria with pricing schemes in an aloha network are analyzed in @xcite . implementing a pricing scheme",
    "requires the central entity to have relevant system information as well as users benefits and costs , which are often their private information . eliciting private information",
    "often results in an efficiency loss in the presence of the strategic behavior of users as shown in @xcite . even in the case where the entity has all the relevant information",
    ", prices need to be computed and communicated to the users .    in this paper , we propose yet another approach using a stackelberg game .",
    "we introduce a network manager as an additional user and make him access the medium according to a certain rule . unlike the stackelberg game of @xcite in which the manager ( the leader ) chooses a certain strategy before users ( followers ) make their decisions , in the proposed stackelberg game he sets an intervention rule first and then implements his intervention after users choose their strategies .",
    "alternatively , the proposed stackelberg game can be considered as a generalized stackelberg game in which there are multiple leaders ( users ) and a single follower ( the manager ) and the leaders know the response of the follower to their decisions correctly . with appropriate choices of intervention rules ,",
    "the manager can shape the incentives of users in such a way that their selfish behavior results in cooperative outcomes .    in the context of cognitive radio networks",
    ", @xcite proposes a related stackelberg game in which the owner of a licensed frequency band ( the leader ) can charge a virtual price for using the frequency band to cognitive radios ( followers ) . the virtual price signals the extent to which cognitive radios can exploit the licensed frequency band .",
    "however , since prices are virtual , selfish users may ignore prices when they make decisions if they can gain by doing so . on the contrary , in the stackelberg game of this paper ,",
    "the intervention of the manager is not virtual but it results in the reduction of throughput , which selfish users care about for sure .",
    "hence , the intervention method provides better grounds for the network manager to deal with the selfish behavior of users .",
    "@xcite and @xcite use game theoretic models to study random access .",
    "their approach is to capture the information and implementation constraints using the game theoretic framework and to specify utility functions so that a desired operating point is achieved at a nash equilibrium .",
    "if conditions under which a certain type of dynamic adjustment play converges to the nash equilibrium are met , such a strategy update mechanism can be used to derive a distributed algorithm that converges to the desired operating point . however",
    ", this control - theoretic approach to game theory assumes that users are obedient . in this paper ,",
    "our main concern is about the selfish behavior of users who have innate objectives . because we start from natural utility functions and affect them by devising an intervention scheme , we are in a better position to deal with selfish users .",
    "furthermore , the idea of intervention can potentially lead to a distributed algorithm to achieve a desired operating point .    by formulating the medium access problem as a non - cooperative game ,",
    "we show the following main results :    1 .   because the nash equilibria of the non - cooperative game are inefficient and/or unfair , we transform the original game into a stackelberg game , in which any feasible outcome with independent transmission probabilities can be achieved as a stackelberg equilibrium .",
    "a particular form of a stackelberg intervention strategy , called total relative deviation ( trd)-based intervention , is constructed and used to achieve any feasible outcome with independent transmission probabilities .",
    "the additional amount of information flows required for the transformation is relatively moderate , and it can be further reduced without large efficiency losses .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 introduces the model and formulates it as a non - cooperative game called the contention game .",
    "nash equilibria of the contention game are characterized , and it is shown that they typically yield suboptimal performance . in section 3 , we transform the contention game into another related game called the stackelberg contention game by introducing an intervening manager .",
    "we show that the manager can implement any transmission probability profile as a stackelberg equilibrium using a class of intervention functions .",
    "section 4 discusses natural candidates for the target transmission probability profile selected by the manager . in section 5",
    ", we discuss the flows of information required for our results and examine the implications of some relaxations of the requirements on performance .",
    "section 6 provides numerical results , and section 7 concludes the paper .",
    "we consider a simple contention model in which multiple users share a communication channel as in @xcite .",
    "a user represents a transmitter - receiver pair .",
    "time is divided into slots of the same duration .",
    "every user has a packet to transmit and can send the packet or wait .",
    "if there is only one transmission , the packet is successfully transmitted within the time slot .",
    "if more than one user transmits a packet simultaneously in a slot , a collision occurs and no packet is transmitted .",
    "we summarize the assumptions of our contention model .    1 .",
    "a fixed set of users interacts over a given period of time ( or a session ) .",
    "time is divided into multiple slots , and slots are synchronized .",
    "a user always has a packet to transmit in every slot .",
    "the transmission of a packet is completed within a slot .",
    "a user transmits its packet with the same probability in every slot .",
    "there is no adjustment in the transmission probabilities during the session .",
    "this excludes coordination among users , for example , using time division multiplexing .",
    "there is no cost of transmitting a packet .",
    "we formulate the medium access problem as a non - cooperative game to analyze the behavior of selfish users .",
    "we denote the set of users by @xmath0 . because we assume that a user uses the same transmission probability over the entire session , the strategy of a user is its transmission probability , and we denote the strategy of user @xmath1 by @xmath2 and the strategy space of user @xmath1 by @xmath3 $ ] for all @xmath4 .",
    "once the users decide their transmission probabilities , a strategy profile can be constructed .",
    "the users transmit their packets independently according to their transmission probabilities , and thus the strategy profile determines the probability of a successful transmission by user @xmath1 in a slot .",
    "a strategy profile can be written as a vector @xmath5 in @xmath6 , the set of strategy profiles .",
    "the payoff function of user @xmath1 , @xmath7 , is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 measures the value of transmission of user @xmath1 and @xmath10 is the probability of successful transmission by user @xmath1 .",
    "we define the _ contention game _ by the tuple @xmath11 .",
    "if the users choose their transmission probabilities taking others transmission probabilities as given , then the resulting outcome can be described by the solution concept of nash equilibrium @xcite .",
    "we first characterize the nash equilibria of the contention game .",
    "a strategy profile @xmath12 is a nash equilibrium of the contention game @xmath13 if and only if @xmath14 for at least one @xmath1 .    _ * proof * _ : in the contention game , the best response correspondence of user @xmath1 assumes two sets : @xmath15 if @xmath16 and @xmath17 $ ] if @xmath18 .",
    "suppose that user @xmath1 chooses @xmath14 .",
    "then it is playing its best response while other users are also playing their best responses , which establishes the sufficiency part . to prove the necessity part ,",
    "suppose that @xmath19 is a nash equilibrium and @xmath20 for all @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath16 , @xmath2 is not a best response to @xmath21 , which is a contradiction .    ' '' ''    if a nash equilibrium @xmath19 has only one user @xmath1 such that @xmath14 , then @xmath22 and @xmath23 for all @xmath24 where @xmath25 can be as large as @xmath26 .",
    "if there are at least two users with the transmission probability equal to 1 , then we have @xmath27 for all @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath28 , u_j = 0 \\ ; \\forall j \\neq i \\}$ ] .",
    "then , the set of nash equilibrium payoffs is given by @xmath29    given the game @xmath13 , we can define the _ set of feasible payoffs _ by @xmath30 a payoff profile @xmath31 in @xmath32 is _ pareto efficient _ if there is no other element @xmath33 in @xmath32 such that @xmath34 and @xmath35 for at least one user @xmath1 .",
    "we also call a strategy profile @xmath19 pareto efficient if @xmath36 is a pareto efficient payoff profile .",

    "these are the corner points of @xmath37 in which only one user receives a positive payoff",
    ". therefore , nash equilibrium payoff profiles are either inefficient or unfair . moreover , since @xmath14 is a _ weakly dominant strategy _ for every user @xmath1 , in a sense that @xmath44 for all @xmath45 , the most likely nash equilibrium is the one in which @xmath46 for all @xmath4 . at the most likely nash equilibrium",
    ", every user always transmits its packet , and as a result no packet is successfully transmitted .",
    "hence , the selfish behavior of the users is likely to lead to a network collapse , which gives zero payoff to every user , as argued also in @xcite .    .",

    "if coordination between the two users is possible , they can achieve any payoff profile in the dark area of figure 1(a ) .",
    "for example , @xmath48 can be achieved by arranging user 1 to transmit only in odd - numbered slots and user 2 only in even - numbered slots .",
    "this kind of coordination can be supported through direct communications among the users or mediated communications . however , if such coordination is not possible and each user has to choose one transmission probability , nash equilibria yield the payoff profiles in figure 1(b ) .",
    "the set of feasible payoffs of the contention game is shown as the dark area of figure 1(c ) .",
    "the set of pareto - efficient payoff profiles is the frontier of that area .",
    "the lack of coordination makes the set of feasible payoffs smaller reducing the area of figure 1(a ) to that of figure 1(c ) . because the typical nash equilibrium payoff is @xmath49 , the next section develops a transformation of the contention game , and the set of equilibria of the resulting stackelberg game",
    "is shown to expand to the entire area of figure 1(c ) .",
    "we introduce a network manager as a special kind of user in the contention game and call him user 0 . as a user , the manager can access the channel with a certain transmission probability . however , the manager is different from the users in that he can choose his transmission probability depending on the transmission probabilities of the users .",
    "this ability of the manager enables him to act as the police .",
    "if the users access the channel excessively , the manager can intervene and punish them by choosing a high transmission probability , thus reducing the success rates of the users .",
    "formally , the strategy of the manager is an _ intervention function _",
    "@xmath50 $ ] , which gives his transmission probability @xmath51 when the strategy profile of the users is @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath52 can be interpreted as the level of intervention or punishment by the manager when the users choose @xmath19 .",
    "note that the level of intervention by the manager is the same for every user .",
    "we assume that the manager has a specific `` target '' strategy profile @xmath53 , that his transmission has no value to him ( as well as to others ) , and that he is benevolent .",
    "one representation of his objective is the payoff function of the following form : @xmath54 this payoff function means that the manager wants the users to operate at the target strategy profile @xmath53 with the minimum level of intervention .",
    "we call the transformed game the _ stackelberg contention game _ because the manager chooses his strategy @xmath55 before the users make their decisions on the transmission probabilities . in this sense",
    ", the manager can be thought of as a stackelberg leader and the users as followers .",
    "the specific timing of the stackelberg contention game can be outlined as follows :    1 .",
    "the network manager determines his intervention function .",
    "2 .   knowing the intervention function of the manager , the users choose their transmission probabilities simultaneously .",
    "observing the strategy profile of the users , the manager determines the level of intervention using his intervention function .",
    "the transmission probabilities of the manager and the users determine their payoffs .",
    "timing 1 happens before the session starts .",
    "timing 2 occurs at the beginning of the session whereas timing 3 occurs when the manager knows the transmission probabilities of all the users .",
    "therefore , there is a time lag between the time when the session begins and when the manager starts to intervene .",
    "payoffs can be calculated as the probability of successful transmission averaged over the entire session , multiplied by valuation .",
    "if the interval between timing 2 and timing 3 is short relative to the duration of the session , the payoff of user @xmath1 can be approximated as the payoff during the intervention using the following payoff function : @xmath56        the transformation of the contention game into the stackelberg contention game is schematically shown in figure 2 .",
    "the figure shows that the main role of the manager is to set the intervention rule and to implement it .",
    "the users still behave non - cooperatively maximizing their payoffs , and the intervention of the manager affects their selfish behavior even though the manager does neither directly control their behavior nor continuously communicate with the users to convey coordination or price signals .    in the stackelberg routing game of @xcite ,",
    "the strategy spaces of the manager and a user coincide .",
    "if that is the case in the stackelberg contention game , i.e. , if the manager chooses a single transmission probability before the users choose theirs , then this intervention only makes the channel lossy but it does not provide incentives for users not to choose the maximum possible transmission probability . hence , in order to provide an incentive to choose a smaller transmission probability , the manager needs to vary his transmission probability depending on the transmission probabilities of the users .",
    "a stackelberg game is analyzed using a backward induction argument .",
    "the leader predicts the nash equilibrium behavior of the followers given his strategy and chooses the best strategy for him .",
    "the same argument can be applied to the stackelberg contention game .",
    "once the manager decides his strategy @xmath55 and commits to implement his transmission probability according to @xmath55 , the rest of the stackelberg contention game ( timing 24 ) can be viewed as a non - cooperative game played by the users .",
    "given the intervention function @xmath55 , the payoff function of user @xmath1 can be written as @xmath57 in essence , the role of the manager is to change the non - cooperative game that the users play from the contention game @xmath13 to a new game @xmath58 , which we call the _ contention game with intervention @xmath55_. understanding the non - cooperative behavior of the users given the intervention function @xmath55 , the manager will choose @xmath55 that maximizes his payoff .",
    "we now define an equilibrium concept for the stackelberg contention game .",
    "an intervention function of the manager @xmath55 and a profile of the transmission probabilities of the users @xmath59 constitutes a _ stackelberg equilibrium _ if ( i ) @xmath60 is a nash equilibrium of the contention game with intervention @xmath55 and ( ii ) @xmath61 and @xmath62 .    combining ( i ) and ( ii ) , an equivalent definition is that ( @xmath63 is a stackelberg equilibrium if @xmath53 is a nash equilibrium of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "condition ( i ) says that once the manager chooses his strategy , the users will play a nash equilibrium strategy profile in the resulting game , and condition ( ii ) says that expecting the nash equilibrium strategy profile of the users , the manager chooses his strategy that achieves his objective .",
    "as we have mentioned earlier , the manager can choose only one level of intervention that affects the users equally .",
    "a question that arises is which strategy profile the manager can implement as a stackelberg equilibrium with one level of intervention for every user .",
    "we answer this question constructively .",
    "we propose a specific form of an intervention function with which the manager can attain any strategy profile @xmath53 with @xmath66 for all @xmath1 .",
    "the basic idea of this result is that because the strategy of the manager is not a single intervention level but a function whose value depends on the strategies of the users , he can discriminate the users by reacting differently to their transmission probabilities in choosing the level of intervention .",
    "therefore , even though the realized level of intervention is the same for every user , the manager can induce the users to choose different transmission probabilities .    to construct such an intervention function , we first define the _ total relative deviation ( trd ) of @xmath19 from @xmath53 _ by @xmath67 since @xmath55 determines the transmission probability of the manager , its range should lie in @xmath68 $ ] . to satisfy this constraint",

    "the trd - based intervention can be interpreted in the following way .",
    "the manager sets the target at @xmath53 . as long as the users choose small transmission probabilities so that the trd of @xmath19 from @xmath53 does not exceed zero",
    ", the manager does not intervene .",
    "if it is larger than zero , the manager will respond to a one - unit increase in @xmath2 by increasing @xmath71 by @xmath72 units until the trd reaches 1 .",
    "the manager determines the degree of punishment based on the target transmission probability profile .",
    "if he wants a user to transmit with a low probability , then his punishment against its deviation is strong .",
    "[ prop1]proposition    @xmath73 constitutes a stackelberg equilibrium .    _",

    "second , @xmath75 .",
    "it is straightforward to confirm the second . to show the first , the payoff function of user @xmath1 given others strategies @xmath76 is @xmath77 it can be seen from the above expression that @xmath78 is increasing on @xmath79 , reaches a peak at @xmath80 , is decreasing on @xmath81 , and then stays at 0 on @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , user @xmath1 s best response to @xmath76 is @xmath83 for all @xmath1 , and thus @xmath53 constitutes a nash equilibrium of the contention game with trd - based intervention , @xmath74 .    ' '' ''    any feasible payoff profile @xmath84 of the contention game with @xmath85 for all @xmath4 can be achieved by a stackelberg equilibrium .",
    "corollary 1 resembles the folk theorem of repeated games @xcite in that it claims that any feasible outcome can be attained as an equilibrium .",
    "incentives not to deviate from a certain operating point are provided by the manager s intervention in the stackelberg contention game , while in a repeated game players do not deviate since a deviation is followed by punishment from other players .      in proposition 2",
