    "the interplay between electronic correlations and the lattice geometry in quantum magnets can lead to a rich variety of spin gapped disordered phases , either spin liquids with fractionalized excitations or various types of valence bond crystals ( vbc ) , which break spontaneously some of the lattice symmetries . among materials magnetically frustrated and possibly presenting such phases , those with a pyrochlore structure , a three - dimensional ( 3d ) array of corner - sharing tetrahedra , are of particular interest because of the absence of magnetic order down to very low temperatures  @xcite . on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) version of the pyrochlore lattice , the _ checkerboard _ lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ diag1 ] ) , the heisenberg model presents a vbc of particular interest , the _ plaquette _ phase  @xcite , which exhibits the rotational symmetry of the lattice . to understand the physics of undoped and doped frustrated magnets and predict the occurrence of these phases in real materials , theoretical tools such as the hubbard model , and models derived from it in the limit of strong on - site repulsion ,",
    "are commonly used in 2d ( also in 3d ) systems .",
    "these exhibit very interesting properties : in a model of bosons on the triangular lattice , doping away from commensurate fillings drives a transition from an insulator to a supersolid phase ( with charge ordering and a finite superfluid density )  @xcite , which is also found in a model of bosons on the checkerboard lattice  @xcite ; on the same lattice , spinless fermions near @xmath3 filling present interesting properties such as fractional charge excitations  @xcite .    in a more specific context , to describe the non - magnetic resonating valence - bond phase of cuprate materials and the transition of this phase to the superconducting phase , the quantum dimer model ( qdm ) was developed in the late eighties  @xcite , mostly on two - dimensional lattices .",
    "this model displays different types of valence bond crystals ( with close analogies with their spin counterparts ) , among which the quite exotic _",
    "plaquette _ phases , and , depending on the lattice ( non- ) bipartiteness , either a liquid phase with topological order ( on the triangular lattice  @xcite ) or a quantum critical point ( roksar - kivelson point ) , both presenting deconfined excitations @xcite .",
    "the qdm is also connected to the physics of pyrochlore systems , since strong coulomb repulsion in the ( extended ) hubbard model on the kagom or on the checkerboard lattice , either for bosons or fermions at special fractional fillings , select low - energy configurations that can be mapped onto dimer or loop configurations .",
    "schematic representation of the hubbard model on the checkerboard lattice . in the limit @xmath4 , this model becomes equivalent to that described by the hamiltonian @xmath5 ( see eq .",
    "[ hk]),width=151 ]    the present study belongs to a series of works about the extended hubbard model on the 2d pyrochlore ( or checkerboard ) lattice , at and slightly away from fractional fillings  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the effective model of @xmath0 fermions at 1/8 filling ( 1 particle for 4 sites ) derived from the extended hubbard model , @xmath6 in the limit of large coulomb repulsions @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( with respect to the energy scale given by the particle hopping amplitude @xmath9 ) .",
    "let us briefly review our current understanding of the physics of the extended hubbard model on the pyrochlore lattice at the special fractional fillings @xmath10 @xmath11  @xcite and mention the important remaining issues . for spinful fermions at these fillings , in the limit where the on - site repulsion @xmath7 is very large compared to the nearest neighbour repulsion @xmath8 and hopping @xmath9 ,",
    "a metal - to - insulator transition was found for increasing @xmath12 at the filling factor @xmath13 ( similarly as in the corresponding hard - core bosonic model  @xcite ) , and the corresponding insulating phase ( for @xmath4 ) exhibits plaquette correlations indicating an ordering very different from a simple charge density wave . whether the metal - to - insulator transition occurs immediately at infinitesimal @xmath8 or at a finite value depends on the degree of the commensurability @xmath14 .",
    "indeed , the perfect nesting property of the non - interaction fermi surface realized only for @xmath15 ( and for a given sign of @xmath9 ) leads to an instability for arbitrarily small @xmath7 and @xmath8  @xcite . in the limit of interest here ( strong couplings ) , an effective model of @xmath0 fermions",
    "was derived in the same study , involving a 2-particle hopping term ( amplitude @xmath16 ) and an additional term ( amplitude @xmath17 ) counting the number of singlet pairs on uncrossed plaquettes .",
    "varying the ratio of the amplitudes of these terms , the system can be tuned from a charge ordered _ columnar _ phase ( the internal structure of columns being that of heisenberg af chains ) in the limit @xmath18 to a disordered rk point at @xmath19 .",
    "note that , in this formulation , the case @xmath20 is believed to provide the effective description of the insulating phase of the large - u , large - v hubbard model on the checkerboard lattice mentioned above .",
    "so far the case corresponding to filling @xmath21 is understood the best .",
    "a phase transition was clearly evidenced at finite ( negative ) @xmath22 between the charge - ordered phase and a resonating singlet - pair crystal ( rspc ) using an analysis based on the symmetry - resolved low - energy spectrum and plaquette correlations in the ground state ( gs ) .",
    "the system at @xmath23 was shown to exhibit also plaquette order by forming a ( lattice rotationally - invariant ) resonating singlet - pair crystal , although with a quadrupling of the lattice unit cell ( instead of a doubling for @xmath21 ) and a 4-fold degenerate ground state . concerning the @xmath13 case ,",
    "the conclusions of the previous study were less clear : although the evolution of plaquette correlations with @xmath22 also supports a transition from a charge - ordered to a rspc , the analysis of low - energy eigenstates was less conclusive than in the @xmath21 and @xmath24 cases , primarily due to larger finite - size effects : in the previous study computations were done on a @xmath25 checkerboard cluster with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "moreover for @xmath13 , taking into account the possibility of new mixed phases ( which are not charge - localized but break rotational symmetry ) requires more caution in the analysis of the low - energy spectrum ( and hence larger clusters ) .",
    "this leads us to consider a new scenario for the phase diagram of the model , which will be described in more detail hereafter .",
    "as outlined above , the effective model is derived from the extended - hubbard model for @xmath0 fermionic particles on the checkerboard lattice , in the limit of very large coulomb repulsion ( more precisely @xmath4 ) . in this limit , at @xmath1 filling ( @xmath13 ) , one can exclude configurations where the 2 neighboring sites are simultaneously occupied .",
    "in other words , each tetrahedra should contain exactly one particle ( of either spin ) , an _",
    "ice rule_-type constraint , which still leaves an exponentially large number of states .",
    "as discussed in the literature , once the particles are viewed as dimers living on the bonds of the square lattice formed by the centers of crossed plaquettes , this constraint is equivalent to the _ hard core _ dimer constraint on the square lattice .",
    "however , in contrast to the `` usual '' qdm on the square lattice , here each dimer carries a color index ( associated to the spin of the electron it represents ) .    in this limit , a single particle hops out of a low - energy configuration ( _ colored dimer _ configuration ) creates a defect centered on a tetrahedra with an energy cost @xmath8 .",
    "this defect can however be annealed by the subsequent hopping of the second particle on the `` defect tetrahedron '' .",
    "such processes lead to an effective kinetic term , i.e. a correlated 2-particle hopping , of amplitude @xmath26 . in terms of dimers ,",
    "this term looks like the kinetic term of the rk model , but acts only on particles of opposite spin on the same uncrossed plaquette ( i.e. dimers of opposite color on the same plaquette ) .",
    "the particles being fermionic , the expression of the kinetic term involves operators of creation ( destruction ) of singlets on uncrossed plaquettes , @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) ,    @xmath29    where the sum is on uncrossed plaquettes ( going around a plaquette @xmath30 , sites are in the order @xmath31 ) . a unitary transformation , consisting in defining operators @xmath32 on every other ascending and every other descending line of the checkerboard lattice oriented as on fig .",
    "[ diag1 ] ( i.e. every other vertical line of vertical links and every other horizontal line of horizontal links of the associated square dimer lattice ) and @xmath33 otherwise , allows that each 2-particle hopping term to have the same amplitude @xmath34 in terms of @xmath35 operators , @xmath36 notice that this is valid only _ in the insulating phases _ at specific fractional fillings like @xmath13 , thanks to the ice rule - type constraint .",
    "in addition , it is possible to label the sites of the lattice in such a way that all exchange processes on the empty squares do not involve any reordering of the fermions so that the @xmath35 operators can be considered as bosonic . in other words ,",
    "our new formulation uses the bosonic representation of the spin singlets ( we have checked the equivalence numerically on the 32-site cluster ) .",
    "following the initial suggestion of ref .",
    "@xcite and according to the discussion above , we also consider a term analogous to the potential term of the qdm , although here it is no longer diagonal in the basis of configurations ,    @xmath37    this terms `` counts '' the number of singlet pairs of next - nearest neighbours ( _ parallel dimers _ ) in all uncrossed plaquettes .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian @xmath38 has a structure similar to that of the roksar - kivelson qdm , with both terms flipping dimers and terms counting the flippable pairs of dimers .",
    "@xmath39 can also be interpreted as a 4-site ring - exchange term on uncrossed plaquettes  @xcite .",
    "it also presents a rk point ( here at @xmath19 ) , while for @xmath40 an ordering in chains is favored ; varying @xmath22 allows to make a continuous connection between both these limits and the case @xmath20 , and to understand better the physics around this point .      since @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the only energy scales in this model ( at zero temperature ) we aim at determining the phase diagram as a function of the ratio @xmath22 ( or @xmath17 , if we set @xmath41 ) .",
    "first , we notice that for @xmath42 , the hamiltonian has the same property as in the quantum dimer model at the rk point : it can be written as a sum of projectors ( one per uncrossed plaquette ) . at this point ( the rk point of the @xmath43 model )",
    "the wave function with an equal amplitude on all configurations ( in each sector of connected configurations ) is annihilated by each projector , and thus is a ground state with zero energy . for @xmath44 ,",
    "again for similar reasons as in the qdm , configurations of minimal energy are those without any flippable pair of spins , and these configurations are ( degenerate ) ground states with zero energy .",
    "the center of interest of this study is the case where @xmath45 , i.e. the region between the rk point and the @xmath46 point , where the ground state is composed of decoupled heisenberg chains ( its energy is the sum of the energy of these chains with an af coupling @xmath47 and a _ charge _ term @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the cumulative length of the chains ) . instead of considering @xmath17 and @xmath16",
    ", one can define a reduced parameter @xmath50 varying continuously between the decoupled heisenberg chains ( @xmath51 ) and the rk point ( @xmath52 ) .    between these points ,",
    "the different phases one can expect are ( i ) a _ columnar _ phase , ordered in chains , with rotational symmetry breaking , translational symmetry breaking in one direction ( perpendicular to the chains ) and thus a 4-fold degeneracy of the corresponding ground state ; this phase is encountered for @xmath53 , and could a priori extend over a finite range of @xmath54 in the vicinity of that point .",
    "note that the term _ columnar _ is used although this phase differs from the columnar phase of the qdm on the square lattice , due to the additional spin degrees of freedom ; ( ii ) a rspc or _",
    "phase , with the full rotational symmetry of the lattice but a breaking of translational symmetry in both directions and a 4-fold degeneracy of the gs ; ( iii ) mixed phases , with rotational and translational ( in both directions ) symmetry breaking ( and a 8-fold degenerate gs ) , corresponding to a dimerization of the heisenberg chains .",
    "a priori two types of mixed phases appear naturally depending whether neighboring chains dimerize in phase , or in antiphase .",
    "note that these phases are a natural extension of the one recently discovered in the context of the rk qdm  @xcite .",
    "we shall refer to them as _",
    "mixed columnar - plaquette crystals _ ( mcpc ) .    knowing that @xmath53 corresponds to a columnar phase , we refer in phase or in antiphase dimerisation as mcpc-1 and mcpc-2 , respectively , as shown schematically in fig .",

    "the transitions indicated between either of these phases and a _ rspc _ should be presumably of first order in the first case and second order in the second case , but one can not exclude that the _ mcpc _ phase extends all the way to the @xmath55 point.,width=294 ]    these phases have distinct symmetries and the corresponding ground states are characterized by different sets of ( 4 or 8) quantum numbers , which we define using the following conventions : the @xmath56 and @xmath57 axes of the lattice are parallel to the links of the square lattice ( on which the _ dimers _ live ) , and the unit length corresponds to one link of this square lattice . to define point group symmetries ( those of the @xmath58 point group - or @xmath59 or @xmath60 for certain wave vectors ) we set the center @xmath61 of the lattice at the center of an uncrossed plaquette .",

    "by contrast , since the _ mcpc-1 _ phase distinguishes itself from the _ rspc _ by the breaking of one of its symmetries ( invariance by a @xmath70 rotation ) , the transition between those could be of second order .      in the present work",

    "the cluster periodicity is compatible with all wave vectors @xmath80 mentioned in the table above ( for the @xmath79 cluster , the wave vector @xmath81-and those equivalent to it up to point group symmetries- are unaccessible ) .",
    "note that we restrict ourselves to the sector @xmath82 ( which includes all total spin sectors ) - for convenience .",
    "in addition , we consider only configurations for which the @xmath83-components of the total spin on each row ( of vertical bonds ) and each column ( of horizontal bonds ) of the square lattice ( which are conserved quantities in the present model ) are zero .",
    "this condition is satisfied by the ground states corresponding to any of the expected phases , and allows us to reduce the number of colorings of any dimer ( = charge ) configuration ( hence the total size of the hilbert space ) . by using the character of spin inversion , all point group symmetries and translations ( in fact , due to the numerical technique for encoding configurations , we use translations not interchanging the sublattices of the dimer lattice , hence @xmath84 translations instead of @xmath85 ) the number of representatives for @xmath77 and @xmath79 clusters are close to @xmath86 and @xmath87 respectively  @xcite .    a powerful tool to determine the phase diagram is the analysis of the lowest energy levels in symmetry sectors associated to each of the quantum numbers mentioned ( and with a character @xmath88 for the spin inversion @xmath89 ) . for the various phases one expects a degeneracy between the quantum numbers marked by @xmath90 in the table  [ table ] , in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath91 ) . on finite clusters ,",
    "this degeneracy is lifted and the lowest state is always found for @xmath92 - hence we look at the lowest excited states .",
    "ideally , an unambiguous signal of spontaneous symmetry breaking is provided by the collapse of the corresponding excitation energies @xmath93 with increasing @xmath94 .",
    "however , the low - energy spectrum on large enough a cluster ( e.g. @xmath77 ) gives enough information for a first analysis .",
    "adding the potential term @xmath17 , to the hamiltonian has several benefits , among them the existence of two particularly simple special points , namely the rk point , and the point at @xmath46 .",
    "for the bosonic model , the latter yields the simple columnar configurations as ground states .",
    "however , @xmath96 does not always present such a simple setting . for the triangular rk model ,",
    "there are two families of ground states , each comprising a number of members exponential in the linear system size , the degeneracy between which is not lifted until perturbations to leading non - trivial order in @xmath97 are taken into account @xcite .",
    "the situation for our model is different still .",
    "_ at _ @xmath46 , the ground state is obtained by maximising the number of plaquettes with a pair of dimers in a singlet configuration .",
    "this leads to formation of a state breaking rotational and translational symmetries  just like the columnar state  but in which the spin correlations along the columns are critical .",
    "indeed , @xmath96 corresponds to decoupled heisenberg cains .",
    "the question appropriate to the setting of small @xmath98 is thus : what is the most relevant perturbation induced by the kinetic term",
    ". this question has been addressed in  formally related  contexts by essler , tsvelik and starykh + coworkers @xcite .",
    "we closely follow the approach of the latter @xcite .",
    "their observation that in the heisenberg chain not only the staggered spin but also the staggered energy correlations are critical  both decay as @xmath99  is central : the chains are close to not only neel but also to dimer ordering .    for our model ,",
    "the coupling of the staggered dimerisation between neighbouring chains is symmetry allowed , and hence will generically appear as a perturbation is added .",
    "indeed , it is easy to see how this happens in our model . for finite @xmath98 , flipping the dimers in two neighbouring plaquettes in adjacent rows yields an energy gain of @xmath100 for the plaquette marked by a cross in fig .",
    "[ pm ] , whereas there is no such gain for the two plaquettes marked by circles .",
    "the coupling between the chains is thus generated at @xmath101 , as each plaquette needs to be flipped out of the chain and back .",
    "as analysed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this coupling is relevant and it will immediately lead to an in - phase dimerisation of adjacent chains . in our above classification , this corresponds to a _",

    "before we move on to variational ( section [ vari ] ) and numerical ( sections [ exd ] and [ corr ] ) investigations of the effective @xmath43 model on the checkerboard lattice , let us make some further remarks on the regime where @xmath104 .",
    "this will serve as a warm - up exercise for identifying ground states by quantum numbers .",
    "let us consider a pair of heisenberg chains of length @xmath105 ( with periodic boundary conditions , the chain axis being @xmath56 ) , of spins-1/2 @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the hamiltonian , @xmath108 captures then coupling described above , although the true effective coupling is more complicated , in particular , it includes similar four - spin terms along the chain favouring the same dimerisation pattern .    at @xmath109 ,",
    "the ground state is the product of ground states of the heisenberg model on each chain , and has a symmetry @xmath110 a ( b ) labeling even ( odd ) states w.r.t . the chain interchange .",
    "the first excited state in the @xmath111 sector correspond to a 2-triplet excitation on one chain ( the other chain remaining in the gs ) .",
    "it is doubly degenerate , the quantum numbers of both states being @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "this state has ( similarly to 1-triplet excitations ) an excitation energy proportional to @xmath114 , thus collapsing to the ground state in the thermodynamic limit .    when a weak interchain coupling @xmath115 is added , the degeneracy of this first excited state is lifted , with a splitting proportional to @xmath116 , as shown on fig .",
    "since each of these states has the symmetry of a dimerized state , with dimerization either in phase ( state @xmath117 ) or in antiphase ( state @xmath118 ) , the sign of this splitting is therefore associated with the type of dimerization susceptible to spontaneously appear in the system : for @xmath119 , the @xmath118 state has a lower energy than the @xmath117 state and the system tends to dimerize in antiphase ; this is the opposite case for @xmath120 .",

    "the excitation energy of the lowest excited singlet state ( @xmath117 for @xmath121 and @xmath118 for @xmath123 ) vanishes in the thermodynamic limit ( the convergence is as @xmath114 for @xmath124 ) , while the excitation energy to the lowest triplet converges to a finite value ( spin gap ) ( see right plot on fig .",
    "[ kc ] ) . consequently , while on a small enough system the triplet excitation has lower energy than the lowest singlet , these levels cross as a function of system size ( at fixed @xmath116 ) .",
    "this is illustrated ( in a slightly different way ) by the left plot on fig .",
    "[ kc ] , showing the positions of crossings @xmath125 between the lowest triplet and either the lowest @xmath117 or @xmath118 singlet , as a function of system size .",

    "therefore the lowest singlet excitation , of symmetry either @xmath117 or @xmath118 depending of the sign of @xmath115 , collapses onto the gs in the thermodynamic limit while a spin gap survives above .",

    "even for @xmath96 , there will be finite - size gaps of @xmath130 , which vanishes algebraically due to the criticality of the chains , while the other gap , parametrically small in @xmath98 , collapses due to the presence of symmetry - breaking .",
