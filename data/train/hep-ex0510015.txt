    "further information on radiative decays of heavy quarkonia can be found in  @xcite .",
    "light - meson production in @xmath15 two - body radiative decays has been experimentally well established with branching fractions at the @xmath16 level , based largely on evidence provided by radiative decays to a pair of hadrons radiative decays . ]",
    ". the production ratios of the available helicity states have been measured for the tensor mesons @xmath7",
    "@xcite and @xmath17  @xcite in @xmath15 two - body radiative decays and agree with theoretical predictions  @xcite .",
    "in 1996 , the bes collaboration reported the observation of the @xmath18 in @xmath15 two - body radiative decays , and measured product branching fractions , @xmath19 ( we use the convention @xmath20 ) , of the order of @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "much excitement was generated at the time because it is possible to interpret the @xmath18 as a glueball .",
    "a candidate similar to @xmath18 was reported in 1986 by the mark iii collaboration in the @xmath22 mode  @xcite , but was not confirmed by the dm2 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "recently , bes reported the existence of a new particle , the @xmath23 , observed by its decay @xmath24  @xcite , a result that is currently being interpreted  @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of radiative @xmath0  decays is challenging because their rate is suppressed to a level of @xmath25 of the corresponding rate of @xmath15 radiative decays .",
    "this factor arises because the quark - photon coupling is proportional to the electric charge , and the quark propagator is roughly proportional to @xmath26 for low momentum quarks .",
    "taking into account the total widths  @xcite of @xmath15 and @xmath0 , the branching fraction of a particular @xmath0  radiative decay mode is expected to be around @xmath27 of the corresponding @xmath28 branching fraction . in 1999 , cleo  ii made the first observation of a radiative @xmath0  decay to a pair of hadrons  @xcite , which was consistent with @xmath29 , where @xmath30 . comparing the measured branching fraction to the @xmath31 branching fraction , a suppression factor of @xmath32 was obtained .",
    "recent theoretical work  @xcite predict a suppression factor between @xmath33 for this mode , and favor the production of @xmath7 in a helicity-0 state . after the bes result for the @xmath18 in radiative @xmath15 decays , a corresponding search was performed by cleo  ii in the radiative @xmath0  system  @xcite and limits",
    "were put on some of the glueball candidates product branching ratios .    in this paper",
    ", we use the cleo  iii @xmath0  data sample , which has fifteen times higher statistics and better particle identification than the cleo  ii data sample , to probe the color - singlet two - gluon spectrum by measuring the system s invariant mass using its decays to @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath12 .",
    "further details of this analysis can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the cleo  iii detector is a versatile multi - purpose particle detector described more fully in  @xcite .",
    "it is centered on the interaction region of cesr . from the @xmath36 interaction region",
    "radially outward it consists of a silicon strip vertex detector and a wire drift chamber used to measure the position , momenta , and specific ionization energy losses ( @xmath37 ) of charged tracks based on their fitted path in a 1.5 t solenoidal magnetic field and the amount of charge deposited on the drift chamber wires .",
    "the silicon vertex detector and drift chamber tracking system achieves a charged particle momentum resolution of 0.35%(1% ) at 1gev / c(5gev / c ) and a @xmath37 resolution of 6% . beyond",
    "the drift chamber is a ring imaging cherenkov detector , rich , which covers 80% of the solid angle and is used to further identify charged particles by giving for each mass hypothesis the likelihood of a fit to the cherenkov radiation pattern .",
    "after the rich is a crystal calorimeter ( cc ) that covers 93% of the solid angle .",
    "the cc has a resolution of 2.2% ( 1.5% ) for 1gev(5gev ) photons .",
    "after the cc is a superconducting solenoid coil that provides the magnetic field , followed by iron flux return plates with wire chambers interspersed in three layers at 3 , 5 , and 7 hadronic interaction lengths to provide muon identification .",
    "the data sample has an integrated luminosity of @xmath38 taken at the @xmath0  energy , @xmath39 , which correspond to @xmath40 million @xmath0  decays  @xcite and @xmath41 taken at the @xmath42  energy , @xmath43 , used to model the underlying continuum present in the @xmath0  data sample .",
    "the continuum background modeling is important because continuum background processes such as @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 with @xmath47 , and direct @xmath48 have the same topology as the signal events we are investigating .",
    "efficiencies are evaluated using a monte carlo simulation of the process  @xcite and a geant - based  @xcite detector response .",
    "monte carlo samples of @xmath49 with @xmath50 are generated at both the @xmath0  and @xmath42  energies with uniform angular distributions and flat @xmath51 invariant mass distributions from threshold to @xmath52 .",
    "events which satisfy the cleo  iii trigger  @xcite are then required to meet the following analysis requirements : ( a ) there are exactly two charged tracks that trace back to the beamspot and have good quality track fits and @xmath37 information .",
    "( b ) there is exactly one cc shower that is unmatched to any track and whose energy , @xmath53 , is greater than @xmath54 .    each event is also required to be consistent with having the 4-momentum of the initial @xmath36 system by demanding that the chi - squared from a kinematic fit to the following constraint , @xmath55 be less than 100 , where @xmath56 is the di - hadron momentum , @xmath57 is the di - hadron energy , @xmath58 is the beam energy , @xmath59 is the photon s direction , and @xmath60 is the momentum of the @xmath36 system ( which has a magnitude of a few mev / c because of the small ( @xmath61 mrad ) crossing angle of the @xmath62 and @xmath63 beams ) . equation  [ constraint ] is a 3-constraint subset of the 4-momentum constraint and has the convenient property of avoiding the use of the measured photon energy , which has an asymmetric measurement uncertainty .",
    "we improve the measurement of the di - hadron 4-momenta ( the di - hadron invariant mass resolution becomes 3.2 , 2.6 , and 2.0@xmath64 for the pion , kaon , and proton modes , respectively ) by using the constraint in equation  [ constraint ] , and then demanding that : @xmath65    strong electron and muon vetoes are imposed to suppress the abundant qed processes @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "to reject @xmath68 , we require each track to have a matched cc shower with an energy @xmath69 , together with a measured momentum @xmath70 , such that @xmath71 , and that the combined rich and @xmath37 likelihood for @xmath72 be higher than the combined likelihood for @xmath73 . to reject @xmath74",
    ", we require that neither track produce a signal in the five hadronic interaction lengths of the muon system . for the @xmath34 mode , where muon background is a particular problem because of the similar pion and muon masses",
    ", we further require that both tracks must be within the barrel part of the muon chambers ( @xmath75 ) , and both have @xmath76 . to increase the solid - angle acceptance of the detector and improve the overall muon suppression efficiency with virtually no increase in muon fakes , we flag an event as `` not muonic '' and remove the muon suppression requirements if either track deposits more than 600mev  in the cc .",
    "events that satisfy all the above requirements are then identified as either @xmath34 , @xmath35 , or @xmath77 using the rich and @xmath37 information . since the ratios @xmath78 and @xmath79 are much larger than 1 for these types of events , in the 3 cases in which we try to reduce the background from a lower - mass hadron , we also use the chi - squared value from the kinematic constraint in equation  [ constraint ] to identify the event type .",
    "since the constraint involves the di - hadron energy , the chi - squared value is sensitive to the hadronic masses . after these procedures , the particle identification efficiencies ( fake rates ) are 90% ( 0.31% ) , 99% ( 0.03% ) , 98% ( 0.10% ) for kaons",
    "( pions faking kaons ) , protons ( pions faking protons ) , and protons ( kaons faking protons ) , respectively .",
    "the overall reconstruction efficiencies as determined by monte carlo simulations , including both event selection and analysis cuts , are 43% , 48% , and 56% for the @xmath0  radiative decays to @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "these efficiencies are only mildly dependent on the di - hadron invariant mass and are very similar for the continuum background events .",
    "the continuum - subtracted di - hadron invariant mass plots are obtained by efficiency correcting each bin of the di - hadron invariant mass plots for the @xmath0  and @xmath43 datasets , scaling the latter plot by a factor of @xmath80 , from the integrated luminosities of the @xmath0  and @xmath81gev  datasets , and the assumption that , to first order , the cross sections of the continuum processes in each run are proportional to @xmath82 . this factor is roughly equal to the factor obtained by using the average energy of each dataset , @xmath83 ] , and subtracting it from the @xmath0  dataset invariant mass plot .",
    "possible signals are determined by fitting each spectrum to spin - dependent relativistic breit - wigner functions invariant mass @xmath84 , @xmath85 where @xmath86 in the above expression , @xmath87 and @xmath88 represent respectively the most likely mass and width , and are allowed to float during the fit .",

    "the number of events for each fitted signal candidate is obtained by integrating this breit - wigner parameterization between threshold and @xmath91 . ] .",
    "the spin value for each breit - wigner is surmised by identifying each possible resonance in the invariant mass plot based on its approximate mass and width .",
    "later , we confirm these spin assignments for the significant resonances by inspecting the angular distributions of the @xmath0  decay products .    the @xmath34 invariant mass plots for the @xmath0  and the scaled @xmath43 datasets are shown in figure  [ paper1.1.eps ] .",

    "each significance is obtained by doing multiple chi - squared fits to the invariant mass plot fixing the signal area to different values , assigning each of these multiple fits a probability proportional to @xmath99 , normalizing the resulting probability distribution , and calculating the probability for negative or 0 signal .",
