    "most nearby galaxies contain massive compact dark objects at their centers .",
    "the number density and masses of these objects are consistent with the hypothesis that they are dead quasars : massive black holes that grew mainly by gas accretion and were once visible as quasars or other active galactic nuclei from radiation emitted during the accretion process ( see kormendy  & richstone 1995 for a review ) .",
    "we have obtained _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ spectra of the centers of 12 nearby galaxies , using first the square aperture of the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) and later the long - slit on the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "additional ground - based spectra have been obtained at the mdm observatory .",
    "pinkney  et  al.(2002a ) describe the data collected by our group for the 10 galaxies observed with stis , and we present the data for the two galaxies observed with fos in the appendix of this paper .",

    "an overall discussion of the dynamical modeling methods is given in gebhardt  et  al .",
    "( 2000a ) and richstone  et  al .",
    "the models are axisymmetric and based on superposition of individual stellar orbits .",
    "section  3 provides the details of the models for these galaxies .",
    "five other galaxies have stellar - dynamical data and models of comparable quality .",
    "three of these are from the leiden group : m32 ( van  der  marel  et  al .",
    "1998 ; verolme  et  al .",
    "2002 ) , ngc  4342 ( cretton  & van den bosch 1999 ) , and ic  1459 ( cappellari  et  al .",
    "the remaining two are ngc  3379 ( gebhardt  et  al .",
    "2000a ) and ngc  1023 ( bower  et  al .",
    "results from these five additional galaxies are included in the analysis in section  4 .",
    "we use orbit - based models rather than parameterized models of the distribution function because parameterization can lead to biased black hole ( bh ) mass estimates .",
    "parameterized models can even imply the presence of a bh when none exists .",
    "orbit - based models do not suffer from this bias .",
    "however , we do make various assumptions whose consequences must be examined ( section  5 ) . in particular , we model galaxies as axisymmetric .",
    "triaxial , and worse yet , asymmetric galaxies , may be poorly represented by axisymmetric models . however , these effects are likely to be random and therefore it is reasonable to expect that the assumption of axisymmetry will not cause an overall bias in the bh mass .",
    "in addition to measuring the bh mass ( @xmath0 ) and stellar mass - to - light ratio ( _",
    "m / l _ , assumed to be independent of position ) , our models constrain the orbital structure in the galaxy .",
    "it appears from this study and those of verolme  et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and cappellari  et  al.(2002 ) that the distribution function in axisymmetric galaxies depends on all three integrals of motion , not just the energy and angular momentum .",
    "preliminary bh masses for these galaxies have been reported by gebhardt  et  al .",
    "( 2000b ) ; these masses are based on a coarser grid of models ( explained in section  4 ) and thus have larger uncertainties than those presented here . however , the best - fit values for the bh masses are nearly the same in the two studies .",
    "most distances in this paper have been measured with the surface - brightness fluctuation method ( sbf , tonry  et  al .",
    "2000 ) ; for those galaxies without an sbf distance we assume the distance in an unperturbed hubble flow and @xmath1 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 .",
    "the data consist of images and spectra from ground - based and _ hst _ observations .",
    "the high spatial resolution of _ hst _ is essential to measure the mass of the central bh .",
    "the ground - based data are essential to constrain the stellar orbital distribution and mass - to - light ratio .",
    "since we are using two - dimensional galaxy models , we must have data along various position angles to constrain adequately the orbital structure .",
    "most of the sample galaxies were imaged with wfpc2 during _ hst _ cycles 4 and 5 ; the exception is ngc 4697 , which was observed with wfpc1 ( see lauer  et  al .",
    "1995 ) . in general , each galaxy was observed in both the f555w ( @xmath3 ) and f814w ( @xmath4 ) filters .",
    "the typical total integration time in each filter was @xmath5  s , but subdivided into shorter exposures to allow for the identification of cosmic - ray events .",
    "the exposure levels at the centers of all galaxies exceeded @xmath6 photons pixel@xmath2 , and were often nearly an order of magnitude higher .",
    "after the sub - exposures were compared to detect and eliminate cosmic - ray events , they were combined and then deconvolved using lucy ( 1974 ) and richardson ( 1972 ) deconvolution .",
    "the point - spread functions ( psfs ) were provided by standard - star observations obtained during the routine photometric monitoring of wfpc2 . typically , 40 iterations of lucy - richardson deconvolution were used .",
    "lauer  et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) demonstrate that this procedure allows accurate recovery of the intrinsic galaxy brightness distribution for all but the central pixel .",
    "brightness profiles were then measured from the deconvolved images using the high - resolution fourier isophote - fitting program of lauer ( 1985 ) . the present work uses the @xmath3-band profiles , given their intrinsically higher spatial resolution .",
    "the _ hst _ imaging provides adequate coverage out to around 10 ; beyond that we rely on ground - based imaging to complete the radial coverage .",
    "ground - based imaging comes primarily from peletier  et  al .",
    "( 1990 ) .",
    "figure  1 presents the luminosity density profiles of the galaxies , which are input to the dynamical models .",
    "we determine the luminosity density distribution from the surface - brightness distribution by assuming that the luminosity density is axisymmetric , and constant on similar spheroids .",
    "( in one galaxy , ngc 4473 , we have included a stellar disk in addition to the spheroidal luminosity distribution . )",
    "we use the non - parametric techniques described by gebhardt  et  al.(1996 ) , which involve smoothing the surface brightness and then inverting the abel integral equation that relates surface brightness and luminosity density .",
    "we note that without this or some other restrictive assumption on the shape of the equidensity surfaces , the deprojection is not unique , except for edge - on galaxies ( gerhard & binney 1996 , kochanek & rybicki 1996 ) . in particular , magorrian & ballantyne ( 2001 )",
    "show that deprojection uncertainties , and in particular face - on disks , can significantly increase the uncertainties in the measured orbital distribution .",
    "we do not attempt a complete treatment of deprojection uncertainties in this paper , but do discuss possible consequences and biases in section 4.9 .",
    "pinkney  et  al .",
    "( 2002a ) present the spectra and kinematics from the _ hst _ stis observations .",
    "most of the galaxies in our sample have spectra taken with stis , except for ngc  3377 and ngc  5845 , which were observed with a single fos aperture .",
    "the kinematic results for these two galaxies are presented in the appendix .",
    "we use the line - of - sight velocity distributions ( losvds ) in the modeling ( i.e. , we fit to the binned losvd , not its moments ) . for most of the galaxies ,",
    "we use 13 equally - spaced velocity bins to represent the losvd .",
    "the width of the velocity bins is generally around 40% of the galaxy s velocity dispersion .",
    "the uncertainty in the signal in each velocity bin is determined using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we reproduce a sample of the velocity profiles in figure  2 ( for ngc  4564 ) .",
    "the losvd can be biased by several systematic effects , including the choice of stellar template , continuum shape , spectral range used in the fit , and amount of smoothing .",
    "these are discussed by pinkney  et  al .",
    "( 2002a ) . in general ,",
    "the most significant bias is probably template mismatch .",
    "however , most of our data are observed in the ca  ii near - triplet region ( 8500   ) , and in this region the losvd is not very sensitive to template variations .",
    "there is scattered light in stis that is about 0.2% of the incoming light .",
    "the scattering occurs after the light has passed through the grating and so is not due to the psf of _",
    "hst_. we measure this light using the spectral lamp images where we can use the high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) to study the wings of the profile .",
    "there is a broad component that has a standard deviation equal to 25 pixels , presumably due to scattering in the stis optics .",
    "we have run extensive tests to determine whether this scattered light affects our results .",
    "it is possible that a bright nucleus can scatter light into neighboring pixels which would not be reflected in the assumed psf .",
    "we simulate this effect in both ngc  3377 ( a power - law galaxy ) and m87 ( a core galaxy ) .",
    "we simulate the two - dimensional image by inputing kinematic profiles consistent with those measured in both galaxies , and then convolving those kinematics with both the narrow and broad components of the psf .",
    "we then extract and fit the profiles ignoring the broad component , and compare with the input values .",
    "there was essentially no effect in m87 , as expected since its kinematic profile does not vary strongly with radius .",
    "for ngc  3377 , the change in the second moment was negligible ; however , the velocity profile showed a 5% reduction in peak amplitude and the dispersion profile showed a 5% increase near the center .",
    "since the second moment was hardly changed , this broad component has no effect on the measured bh mass and is not included in subsequent analysis .    the stis spectral resolution with the g750 m grating is around 55  @xmath7(fwhm ) , with 37  @xmath7  per binned pixel ( we bin 2x1 pixels on the chip for most of our data ) .",
    "since we always use a template star convolved with the losvd to match the galaxy spectrum , we do not have to worry as much about the detailed shape of the spectral psf ( as opposed to understanding the spatial psf ) because the velocity dispersions of our galaxies are much larger than the spectral fwhm .",
    "the main concern is whether we are illuminating the slit with the templates in the same way that we illuminate with the galaxy . for galaxies with point - like nuclei ,",
    "this is not a concern , but for those with shallow light profiles we must consider the effect .",
    "the concern is whether the velocity variation across the slit adds to the dispersion measured in the galaxy , which would not be true for a point source .",
    "we can calculate the effect using the results of bower  et  al .",
    "for the 0.1  slit , the velocity variation from slit edge to edge is around 20  @xmath7 , and for the 0.2  slit , it is 40  @xmath7 . given the fwhm of the spectral lines , 55  @xmath7 , the velocity variation provides a 725% increase in the required instrumental spectral fwhm .",
    "however , for the galaxies where this effect is the largest ( i.e. , the core galaxies ) , the galaxy dispersion is the greatest and therefore the broadening in the galaxy is insignificantly affected by the exact instrumental profile .",
    "for example , in the case of ngc  3608 , the central dispersion is 300  @xmath7 ; with a change in the instrumental dispersion from 20  @xmath7  to 25  @xmath7  ( 25% higher ) , the inferred galaxy dispersion differs by only 0.1% .",
    "given the insignificant difference , we apply no correction for illumination effects .",
    "bower  et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) find a similar result for ngc  1023 .",
    "nearly all of the ground - based data come from the mdm observatory ( pinkney  et  al .",
    "briefly , most of the spectra were taken around the ca  ii triplet ( near 8500   ) and the rest were taken near the mg @xmath8 region ( 5100   ) . the instrumental resolution varied slightly from run to run , but was generally around 40  @xmath7 , which is more than adequate given the dispersions of the galaxies studied .",
    "the spatial resolution varied from 0.5  to 1.5 .",
    "we included the appropriate spatial psf for each of the ground - based spectra in the modeling .    in an axisymmetric system ,",
    "the velocity profile at a radius on one side of the galaxy will be identical to a profile that is flipped about zero velocity on the other side of the galaxy at the same radius .",
    "there are three options that we can use to include this symmetry in the models .",
    "first , we can fit the same , but appropriately flipped , observed velocity profile on the two spectra from opposite sides of the galaxy during the extraction . in this way",
    ", we only include one profile at a given radius .",
    "second , we can independently fit velocity profiles from opposite sides of the galaxy , and then average these two velocity profiles ( after flipping one of them ) to provide one profile for that radius .",
    "third , we can include the two independently fit velocity profiles directly into the models .",
    "each of these has their own advantages and disadvantages .",
    "for example , if there is a bad spot on the detector or a star on one side of the galaxy , then the most reliable measure would be to use the third option ( since one can then exclude the affected region ) .",
    "we have tried all three methods and find little differences between the results .",
    "we choose to use the first option since , in that case , the s / n used for the extraction of the velocity profile is increased by @xmath9 compared to the other cases , and this serves to alleviate potential biases .",
    "this increase arises because we use two spectra to measure one velocity profile , as opposed to measuring two independent velocity profiles .",
    "the uncertainty ( and hence , the s / n ) in the resultant velocity profile is the same regardless of the method used to estimate it , but our reason for using the first option is motivated by alleviating potential biases in the extraction of the velocity profile",
    ". for low s / n data , there are often biases in the velocity profile ( mainly due to the need to use more smoothing as the signal is lowered ) , and we decrease these biases by forcing axisymmetry during the spectral extraction . the alternative of using individual profiles from both sides of the galaxy is not optimal .",
    "richstone  et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) provide a complete account of the construction of the dynamical models , including analytic tests . here , we provide a basic summary and include the details that are specific to these galaxy models .",
    "other groups discuss the use of and tests for similar orbit - based models ( van der marel  et  al .",
    "1998 , cretton  & van den bosch 1999 , cretton  et  al .  1999 , 2000 ,",
    "cappellari  et  al .",
    "2002 , verolme  & de zeeuw 2002 , and verolme  et  al .",
    "these studies used models similar to each other ; the models presented here and in gebhardt  et  al .  ( 2000a ) differ from those above in small but important ways . as discussed in richstone  et  al .",
    "our models use a maximum likelihood approach to find the orbital weights as opposed to using a regularization method , and ours also use the full losvd as opposed to using parameterized moments . there are positives and negatives associated with the different approaches and a full comparison can only be studied when the different models are applied to identical datasets .",
    "the dynamical models are constructed as follows : we first determine the luminosity density from the surface brightness profile .",
    "although we have constructed models with a variety of inclinations , we generally assume that the galaxy is edge - on , for reasons given in section 4 . in this case , the deprojection is unique . to determine the potential we assume a stellar mass - to - light ratio and a bh mass .",
    "in this potential we run a representative set of orbits ( typically 7000 ) that cover phase space adequately .",
    "we then find the non - negative set of weights for those orbits that provides the best match to the available data ( in the sense of minimum @xmath10 ) . in order to have a smooth phase space distribution",
    ", we use a maximum entropy method as described below .",
    "we repeat this analysis for different bh masses and different mass - to - light ratios to find the overall best fit .",
    "we measure the velocity moments of our models on a two - dimensional grid in radius and angle relative to the symmetry axis of the galaxy .",
    "we generally use 20 radial and 5 angular grid elements .",
    "the parameters of this grid ( spacing and extent ) are designed to maximize the s / n in both the kinematics and the photometry .",
    "the angular bins have centers at latitudes 5.8 , 17.6 , 30.2 , 45.0 , and 71.6 , where the angle is defined from the major to the minor axis ; we use the same binning scheme whether we are in projected or internal space .",
    "we have run tests in which we both double and halve the number of bins and we find insignificant differences .",
    "since stis provides kinematic information along a slit , we need to specify how to extract the data along that slit to optimize the s / n to measure the bh mass .",
    "pinkney  et  al .",
    "( 2002a ) describe the 20 radial extraction windows that we use .",
    "we define our radial binning scheme in the models with the same configuration as that used in the data extraction .",
    "we specify the galaxy potential and the forces on a grid that is five times finer than the grids used in the data comparisons , in order to assure accurate orbit integration .",
    "if we have @xmath11 radial bins , labeled @xmath12 , our goal is to have at least one orbit with apocenter and pericenter in every possible pair of bins @xmath13 in order to cover phase space well ; this requires @xmath14 orbits , times two to include stars with the opposite sign of rotation .",
    "this leads to 380 orbits ; however , we must also cover the angular dependence and to do this we include 20 additional angular bins .",
    "thus , the total number of orbits is around 7000 .",
    "we track the velocity information by storing the losvd for each orbit in each grid element . for each galaxy",
    "we use 13 velocity bins , spanning the maximum and minimum velocities generated for the whole orbit distribution .",
    "it is important to include all velocity information , particularly in the losvd wings where the effects from the bh are the strongest .",
    "our final models consist of 7000 ( orbits ) x 20 ( radial ) x 5 ( angular ) x 13 ( velocity ) elements . for each galaxy",
    ", we generally try about 10 different bh masses , 10 or more values of _ m / l _ , and sometimes a few different inclinations .",
    "we have also run models where we have both doubled and halved the number of orbits . in either case , we find no difference in the best fit to the data .",
    "in addition to the projected quantities , we track the internal properties including the velocity moments and luminosity density .",
    "for the dynamics , we only track the zeroth , first , and second moments of the velocity profile .",
    "the internal moments are presented in section 4.7 below .",
    "it is important to include the effects of the psf of _ hst _ in the dynamical models .",
    "we use the same psf as measured by bower  et  al.(2001 ) , which has fwhm = 0.08  along the slit at 8500   . at 8500   , the first diffraction peak is visible and is included in the psf model .",
    "this profile comes from a highly sampled psf using a cut in the spatial direction for a star at various columns on the chip . since there is a 6-row shift of the star across the stis chip , the psf is sampled differently in each column , thereby producing a well - sampled profile .",
    "unfortunately , this procedure only produces a psf in one dimension ( along the slit ) , and we have no measurement of the psf in the spectral direction .",
    "as discussed by bower  et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the psf is expected to be circularly symmetric , so we assume that the psf across the slit is the same as the psf measured along the slit .",
    "we run all orbit libraries with no psf included and then convolve with the appropriate psf before we fit to the kinematic data . in this way",
    ", we can include a different psf for each kinematic observation , if necessary .",
    "we have ground - based kinematic data along 24 position angles for each galaxy , covering over half of the radial bins .",
    "thus , we typically have 20 positions on the sky , each with 13 losvd bins , for a total of 260 data bins .",
    "however , as explained by gebhardt  et  al .",
    "( 2000a ) and discussed further in  4.1 , the number of degrees of freedom is difficult to estimate .",
    "the main problem is that the smoothing in the losvd estimation introduces covariance between velocity bins . for a typical galaxy ,",
    "every two velocity bins are correlated .",
    "this factor of two is determined through simulations where we vary the smoothing parameter in the velocity profile estimate and measure the effect on @xmath10 ( see gebhardt  et  al .",
    "thus , the number of degrees of freedom is reduced by a factor of roughly two compared to the total observed parameters .",
    "the orbit weights are chosen so that the luminosity density in every spatial bin matches the observations to better than 1% . typically , the match is better than 0.1% .",
    "we regard matching the luminosity density in each bin as a set of constraints , rather than a set of data points .",
    "thus , the photometric data do not contribute to the total number of degrees of freedom .",
    "we make this choice for two reasons : first , the uncertainties in the photometry are much smaller than those in the kinematics ; second , including photometric uncertainties would require compiling a far larger set of orbit libraries ( one for each tested photometric profile ) .    to ensure that the phase - space distribution function is smooth , we maximize the entropy as in richstone & tremaine ( 1984 ) .",
    "we do this by defining a function @xmath15 , where @xmath10 is the sum of squared residuals to the data , @xmath16 is the entropy , and @xmath17 is a parameter describing the relative weights of entropy and residuals in the fit .",
    "our goal is to minimize @xmath18 .",
    "we start with a large value of @xmath17 and then gradually reduce it until further improvement in @xmath10 is no longer possible . at first",
    ", the entropy determines the orbital weights but , at the end of the minimization , the entropy has no influence on the quality of the fit .",
    "the entropy constraint does affect those regions where we do not have kinematic data , but we never use results from those regions .",
    "solving for the 7000 orbital weights with 200500 observations is the most computationally expensive part of the analysis .",
    "we have tried a variety of initial conditions for the orbital weights and entropy forms , and find that neither the minimum value of @xmath10 , nor the bh mass and stellar mass - to - light ratio , nor the orbital structure is sensitive to these choices .",
    "we need to determine the uncertainties in the bh mass and the stellar _",
    "m / l_. these are correlated , of course , and we generally use two - dimensional @xmath10 distributions to determine the uncertainties . the uncertainties in the parameters are determined from the change in @xmath10 as we vary one of the variables ; in this case , the 68% confidence band is reached when @xmath10 increases above its minimum value by 1 .",
    "this parameter estimation is different from hypothesis testing : a tested hypothesis is consistent with the data if @xmath10 per degree of freedom is approximately unity , while the allowed range of a parameter is determined by the change in @xmath10 from its minimum value .",
    "for example , since the bh has no effect on the kinematics at large radii , we could always ensure that a galaxy is consistent with the hypothesis that there is no bh by adding more and more kinematic data at large radii .",
    "thus , we advocate that one must use @xmath19 in order to determine the uncertainties in the parameters .",
    "this conclusion was also discussed in both van der marel  et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) and cretton  et  al.(2000 ) .",
    "the difficulty for the parameter estimation is that we need to measure the uncertainties in the kinematics accurately .",
    "the uncertainties on the kinematics are difficult to quantify ; problems due to template mismatch and continuum estimation , for example , can have a significant effect on the results .",
    "we have tried to take this into account during the monte carlo simulations that we use to generate the errors .",
    "a more natural approach would be to use a bayesian analysis , but given the large number of unknown variables ( the 7000 orbital weights ) , this is impractical .",
    "figure  2 shows the data / model comparison for three losvds in ngc  4564 . for this galaxy ,",
    "we actually have 33 velocity profiles but only show three here .",
    "thus , there is significantly more data that has gone into the models .",
    "for ngc  4564 , the signature for the bh comes from the central few bins in each of the three position angles .",
    "however , it is only by examining the full dataset can one understand the global fit for any particular model .",
    "the change in @xmath10 is given in the bottom plot .",
    "the difference between the best - fit bh and zero bh model in just these three bins is equal to 8 . using the full dataset",
    "the difference is 53 , implying an extremely high significance against the zero bh model .",
    "the three main properties which we obtain from the models are the bh mass , mass - to - light ratio , and the orbital structure . the bh mass and mass - to - light ratio",
    "are fitted by choosing a grid of parameters for them and then examining their @xmath10 distribution . the orbital structure , however , results from finding the orbital weights for each specified potential ( i.e. , bh mass and mass - to - light ratio ) that provides the minimum @xmath10 .",
    "each bh mass / mass - to - light ratio pair produces a best fit orbital structure , but the overall best model is that which has the one global minimum . in this section ,",
    "we discuss results for each parameter , and consider possible biases and additional uncertainties .",
    "figure  3 presents @xmath10 as a function of bh mass and",
    "_ m / l_. the contours are drawn using a two - dimensional smoothing spline ( wahba 1980 ) . as in wahba ( 1980 ) , generalized cross - validation determines the smoothing value ; however , the modeled values are relatively smooth and little smoothing is necessary .",
    "we plot only those points near the @xmath10 minimum ; we have tried many more models that lie outside the limits shown in the plot but only highlight the center to show the contour shape .",
    "models that lie outside these limits are excluded at much greater than 99% confidence .",
    "each approximately vertical sequence represents models with the same ratio of bh mass to galaxy mass ( or _ m / l _ ) , all of which can use the same orbit library except for a trivial rescaling of the velocities .",

    ", there is little covariance between bh mass and _ m / l_.",
    "the reason is that we are probing those regions where the bh mass dominates the potential with multiple resolution elements .",
    "since the stars contribute a small fraction of the total mass in this region , varying their mass - to - light ratios has little effect on the enclosed mass .",
    "the two cases in which there is some covariance , ngc  3377 and ngc  5845 , have high - resolution kinematic data from only a single fos aperture .",

    "thus , we use @xmath24 , 1 degree of freedom uncertainties . we also convert the uncertainties from the orbit - based studies above to our convention of @xmath29 .",

    "the uncertainties given in table  1 include those as measured from the edge - on models alone ( or from the one inclined case for ngc  4473 ) .",
    "inclined models do , however , affect the _ m / l _ ; as the galaxy approaches a more face - on configuration , it becomes more intrinsically flat in order to give the same projected flattening .",

    "there are two galaxies , ngc  821 and ngc  4564 , which show a spike in the second moment at the outer stis radius .",
    "this spike is an artifact since we are using only @xmath3 and @xmath42 from the gauss - hermite fits , as opposed to including the higher - order moments , h3 and h4 , in the estimate of the second moment .    in order to judge the quality of the fit",
    ", we have to compare @xmath10 to the numbers of degrees of freedom ( ndof ) .",
    "the ndof is difficult to measure mainly because there is a smoothing parameter in the estimation of the velocity profiles ; this effect typically decreases the ndof by a factor of two .",
    "an additional difficulty in calculating the ndof arises since we often include the outer regions of the velocity profiles where they have no light in the models .",
    "sometimes these regions extend to velocities that are either outside of those measured in the velocity profiles or are very uncertain there . in the regions that are beyond the velocities in which the losvds probe , we use the uncertainty at the last measured velocity .",
    "since we have no velocity profile there , we also set the observed losvds in those bins to zero .",
    "thus , the result is to add zero to the overall @xmath10 , yet increase the ndof .",
    "the problem can most easily be seen in a galaxy that has a significant dispersion gradient with radius . for the modeling , we use a fixed velocity interval and bins for the losvd .",
    "in such a galaxy with a large dispersion gradient , the outer edges of the velocity profile in the center of the galaxy will contain some light , while those regions at large radii will not .",
    "this effect can be dramatic in some galaxies , causing about half of the velocity bins to have zero light for the large - radii losvd .",
    "thus , there is a further reduction in the ndof that one needs to apply in order to judge the quality of the fit .",
    "column  6 in table  2 reports the total numbers of fitted parameters for each of the galaxies . comparing these numbers to the total minimum @xmath10 ( col .  7 ,",

    "however , we need more data to decide on the significance , since it is only at the 20% level in the anisotropy .",
    "a full treatment of the correlations should include a proper principal component analysis ( pca ) ; however , given the uncertainties and small sample , we are not in a position to explore pca , especially since the @xmath33 relation provides such small scatter already .",
    "we use the effective dispersion , @xmath21 , as a representation of the galaxy velocity dispersion ; @xmath21 is the second moment of the velocity profile integrated from @xmath49 to @xmath50 along the major axis with a slit width of 1 .",
    "the idea is to represent the galaxy by one dispersion estimate .",
    "there are many ways to do this ; for example , jrgensen  et  al .",
    "( 1996 ) , faber  et  al .",
    "( 1989 ) , and the sloan survey ( bernardi  et  al .",
    "2002 ) use the second moment inside a circular aperture of radius @xmath44/8 .",
    "tremaine  et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) discuss the effect that the bh can have on either the effective dispersion or the dispersion inside @xmath44/8 . in most cases , the bh has little effect , @xmath513% , but in some galaxies the effect can be as large as 30% .",
    "the effective dispersions are given in table  1 .",
    "in all cases the s / n is very high , over 100 .",
    "the corresponding statistical uncertainty in @xmath21 ranges from 13% .",
    "however , at this level , systematic uncertainties dominate , particularly continuum estimation and template mismatch .",
    "we have investigated both of these effects by varying the continuum level and using different templates .",
    "we find that at any s / n , using an appropriate range of systematic variables , the overall uncertainty is no better than 5% .",
    "therefore , we adopt 5% accuracy for the effective dispersion measurements .",
    "we discuss below how this choice affects the main results .",
    "we show the shape of the velocity dispersion tensor in figure  10 .",
    "we define the tangential dispersion as @xmath52^{1/2}$ ] , so that for an isotropic distribution the radial and tangential dispersions are equal .",
    "note that @xmath53 includes both random and ordered motion ( i.e. , it represents the second moment of the azimuthal velocity relative to the systemic velocity , not relative to the mean rotation speed ) .",
    "the most obvious trend in fig  10 is that the tangential motion tends to become more important towards the center ( discussed below ) in all galaxies except for ngc  4697 .    -180pt",
    "-100pt -100pt    we use two methods to measure the uncertainties on these quantities .",
    "we have run monte carlo simulations for two galaxies , and for the remaining we use the simple alternative of using the smoothness in both the radial and angular profiles to estimate the uncertainties . for the monte carlo simulations we use the same realizations that are used to generate the losvd uncertainties ( pinkney  et  al . ) and to generate the bh mass uncertainties .",
    "for each set of losvd realizations , we find the best - fit model and examine the orbital structure .",
    "we have run these simulations on two galaxies : the core galaxy ngc  3608 and the power - law galaxy ngc  4564 .",
    "figure  11 plots the results .",
    "for the 100 realizations we estimate the 68% confidence bands by choosing the 16% and 84% values in the sorted internal moments at each radii .",
    "figure  11 shows that the drop in the radial motion near the center is statistically significant for both galaxies . at the radii outside of our last measured kinematic measurements ,",
    "the uncertainties become very large , as expected .",
    "we note that the radial profiles are not very smooth .",
    "the level of non - smoothness is consistent with the measured uncertainties .",
    "this noise is likely a result of using the same orbit library with each new losvd realization .",
    "thus , the remaining noise is due to using a limited number of stellar orbits .",
    "ideally , we should include a random sampling of the photometry , and hence the stellar potential in the monte carlo simulations . by doing so",
    ", we would average over noise from a particular set of orbits .",
    "however , this is computationally prohibitive and we rely on the present simulations to provide the uncertainties .    for the other galaxies , we use deviations from smoothness as an estimate of the internal orbital structure uncertainties .",
    "an expectation is that the radial and angular gradient of the internal moments may be smooth , albeit details due to recent merger and accretion history may cause small scale variations .",
    "thus , deviations from a smooth profile may be indicative of the measurement uncertainty .",
    "the three galaxies with the smallest number of kinematic measurements  ngc  2778 , ngc  3377 and ngc  7457show the largest radial and angular variations , suggesting that these are due to increased uncertainties from not having as much kinematic constraints . by inspection of variations seen fig .  10 and fig .  11",
    ", we estimate that the uncertainties on ratio of the internal moments is around 0.1 to 0.2 for most galaxies .",
    "this uncertainty is also consistent with the angular variations .",
    "the models are free to have very different dispersion ratios at different position angles and radii .",
    "the fact that the ratios are similar at different angles suggests that the measurements are robust for these models .",
    "the core galaxies ( denoted with an asterisk ) show a larger decrease in the ratio towards the center which we discuss next .    although the models produce the internal moments everywhere in the galaxies ( i.e. , fig .  10 ) , figure  12 shows them only along the major axis and at two radii : the central bin in the models and an average of the three bins nearest @xmath48 .",
    "the bh dominates the potential in the central bin .",
    "figure  12 shows that galaxies with shallow central density profiles have orbits with strong tangential bias near their centers . at larger radii ,",
    "the orbits tend to be isotropic or slightly radial .",
    "there is a concern that this change in dispersion ratio may simply reflect our assumption that the mass - to - light ratio is independent of radius .",
    "if a dark halo were present , so that the mass - to - light ratio increased outwards , a galaxy with isotropic orbits will appear to become tangentially anisotropic at large radii .",
    "however , it is unlikely that the dark halo makes a significant contribution to the potential within @xmath48 , and in any case the sign of this trend ( increasing tangential anisotropy with radius ) is opposite to the one we observe .",
    "figure  12 only includes results from radii that are small enough to be unaffected by the presence of a dark halo . in any event ,",
    "the most likely bias is that , by not including a dark halo , we will overestimate the amount of tangential anisotropy at large radii . at small radii , the dark halo assumption will have no effect .",
    "therefore , we are confident of the gradient seen in figure  12 .    the bottom panel in figure  12 plots the change in the radial - to - tangential motion between the center and @xmath48 as a function of central slope .",
    "this plot reiterates that the gradient in shape of the dispersion tensor is larger for core galaxies than for power - law galaxies .",
    "the shape of the velocity dispersion tensor depends on the galaxy formation process .",
    "tangentially biased orbits at small radii can occur through the destruction or ejection of stars on high - eccentricity orbits that pass near the bh .",
    "there are now 17 galaxies for which we have measurements of orbital anisotropies ; most come from the dynamical models presented here , but similar results are found using other orbit superposition studies ( m32 : van der marel  et  al .",
    "1998 ; verolme  et  al .",
    "2002 ; ngc  4342 : cretton & van den bosch 1999 ; and ic  1459 : cappellari  et  al .",
    "spherical theoretical models predict a range of both central cusps and anisotropies .",
    "three models that have been studied are adiabatic bh growth ( quinlan  et  al .",
    "1995 ) , fall - in of a single bh ( nakano  & makino 1999 ) , and bh binary models ( quinlan  & hernquist 1997 ) .",
    "the adiabatic models grow the black hole by slow accretion of material ( gas or stars ) .",
    "the bh fall - in models start with a galaxy without a black hole and then a bh is placed a large radii where is falls in due to dynamical friction .",
    "the bh binary model assumes the galaxy has an existing black hole at the center and then a second black hole falls in due to dynamical friction , and they subsequently form a binary bh .",
    "the models predict a different value of the central anisotropy : single bh infall models have @xmath54 , adiabatic models have @xmath55 , and bh binary models have @xmath56 .",
    "the increased tangential anisotropy for the binary models is due to the orbital motion of the binary in the galaxy core , which causes it to affect more stars on radial orbits .",
    "the models that agree best with both observed anisotropies and density slopes depend on the type of galaxy , whether it is a core or power - law . examining the solid points in figure 12 ,",
    "one notices that those galaxies with shallow central densities have the largest tangential motion .",
    "the central @xmath57 for core galaxies is around 0.4 ( highly tangentially biased ) , while that for the power - law galaxies range from 0.45 to 1.05 with an average of 0.8 .",
    "thus , it appears that the core galaxies are more consistent with the bh binary models , and the power - law galaxies are more consistent with adiabatic growth .",
    "these conclusions are similar to those of faber  et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) and ravindranath  et  al .",
    "unfortunately , these comparison models are limited by their simplistic initial conditions ( i.e. , isotropic velocity dispersion tensor , spherical potential ) .",
    "fortunately , the large number of researchers working in this area now ( e.g. , milosavljevic  & merritt 2001 ; holley - bockelmann  et  al .",
    "2002 ; sellwood 2001 ) will provide improved theoretical comparisons .",
    "it is important to know whether the distribution function of these galaxies depends on three integrals of motion or only on the two classical integrals ( energy and @xmath58-component of angular momentum ) . in two - integral models",
    "the dispersion in the @xmath59 and @xmath58 directions must be equal ( where @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath58 are the usual cylindrical coordinates ) .",
    "figure  13 plots this ratio for the 12 galaxies .",
    "there are no obvious radial trends . for seven galaxies , at small radii",
    "the radial dispersion is higher than in the @xmath61 direction . for two",
    ", the @xmath61 motion significantly dominates there . at other radii ,",
    "the results show a variety of trends with some galaxies having rising ratios while others having falling ones .",
    "the _ average _ ratio along the major axis is close to unity ( i.e. , a two - integral model ) , but the radial run demonstrates that the best fit model is inconsistent with having only two integrals of the motion .",
    "this result is similar to that found in other orbit - based models ( verolme  et  al .",
    "2002 ; cappellari  et  al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "we discussed that most of the galaxies ( 10 of the 12 ) have substantial tangential motion near their centers , but not whether this is due to the @xmath61 or @xmath60 motion . by comparison of fig  13 to fig  10 , we notice that at most of the radii , the curves are similar which implies that the @xmath61 and @xmath60 dispersion are similar .",
    "however , figure  13 shows a significant increase in the contribution from the @xmath61 direction near their centers for only two of the galaxies , whereas from fig  10 , we see that most galaxies show a dramatic increase in the tangential motion near their centers .",
    "thus , the dominant component in nearly all of the galaxies near the center is in the @xmath60 direction . at the center ,",
    "the @xmath60 dispersion generally has similar contributions from random and ordered motion .",
    "the theoretical models discussed in  4.7 do not provide the difference between the @xmath61 and @xmath60 dispersions , but these could potentially be important constraints .",
    "our models are limited to axisymmetry .",
    "triaxial and non - symmetric structures may be common attributes of galaxies .",
    "of the 12 galaxies in this sample , at least four  ngc  3377 , ngc  3608 , ngc  4473 , and ngc  7457show signs of non - axisymmetric structure in the kinematics .",
    "an incorrect assumption of axisymmetry could bias our results .",
    "for example , if a bar is observed down its long axis , the radial streaming motions along the bar may increase the projected velocity dispersion .",
    "this measured increase may mimic that expected with a central mass concentration ( gerhard 1988 ) .",
    "we have not investigated the effects of triaxiality on bh mass determinations in detail , but believe that these effects average to zero when the system is viewed from many different orientations ; thus , triaxiality may contribute to the scatter in our mass determinations but should not produce a systematic bias .",
    "furthermore , the scatter due to not considering triaxiality may be a function of galaxy size , since large core galaxies possibly are more triaxial than the smaller power - law galaxies .",
    "clearly , triaxial models should be used to quantify these effects . any bias caused by using an inappropriate stellar distribution",
    "could be more dramatic if we only had data at larger radii where the stellar potential needs to be included .",
    "however , as seen in figure  8 , the ground - based data alone do a fairly good job at measuring the bh mass compared to when including the _",
    "hst_. thus , at least at the level of our uncertainties ,",
    "the bh mass is unaffected by using the large radial data , suggesting that if the galaxies are not axisymmetric then either the non - axisymmetry is unimportant for the modeling or it is constant with radius .",
    "the best way to test biases with the axisymmetry assumption is to either model the same galaxies with triaxial codes or to run the axisymmetric code on an analytic triaxial galaxy .",
    "we have assumed that the surfaces of constant luminosity density in all of our galaxies are similar spheroids ( with the exception of ngc  4473 , where we add a disk component ) .",
    "this assumption is consistent with the observation that the ellipticity of the surface - brightness distribution is similar at all radii , but other density distributions are also consistent with this observation .",
    "the question is whether the assumption of spheroidal equidensity surfaces could bias our bh mass determinations .",
    "some guidance comes from the analysis of magorrian  & ballantyne ( 2001 ) , who study the influence of embedded stellar disks . in this case",
    ", they find that face - on disks in round galaxies in projection may bias a spherical model toward having radial anisotropy .",
    "this effect is primarily seen at large radii and is unlikely to bias the bh mass since we are measuring the kinematics so close to the bh .",
    "but , this effect may be important for the orbital structure that we measure in these galaxies . again , at small radii , the influence of a disk is likely to be small since we do not see strong signatures of one ( except in ngc  4473 ) , however it would be difficult to measure a disk at larger radii . thus , there is a concern that we may be biased by this effect in some of the galaxies at larger radii .",
    "fortunately , only four of our galaxies are rounder than e3 , so this is unlikely to alter the overall conclusions .",
    "there are many other possibilities other than embedded stellar disks that can lead to non - uniqueness in the deprojection .",
    "the best way to understand their effects is to run models with different deprojections . for four of the galaxies ,",
    "we have tried a variety of inclinations and find insignificant changes to both the bh mass and orbital structure .",
    "we have not included a dark halo in this analysis .",
    "it appears that in most elliptical galaxies the dark halo becomes important at about the half - light radius ( kronawitter  et  al .  2000 ;",
    "rix  et  al .",
    "1997 ) . even though we have data and model results at these large radii , and they are plotted in figure  10 , we do not use the model results from these radii because they may be seriously comprised by the exclusion of a dark halo . at radii",
    "less than @xmath48 the stars and central bh dominate the potential . for figure  12 ,",
    "we choose @xmath44/4 ; at this radius the stellar potential dominates .",
    "the bh mass is determined almost exclusively by the small - radii data ; thus , we are confident that exclusion of a dark halo is unimportant for the bh mass estimate .",
    "gebhardt  et  al .",
    "( 2000a ) include various dark - halo profiles and find little difference in the results inside of @xmath44/2 .",
    "the next step in the data analysis is to run models in order to measure both the bh mass and dark halo properties .",
    "we have assumed that the mass - to - light ratio is constant with radius . as we discuss above",
    ", the exclusion of a dark halo is unlikely to affect either the black hole mass or the orbital structure , however , variation at small radii can have an effect .",
    "for example , a dramatic increase in the stellar mass - to - light ratio in the central regions can decrease the measured bh mass if not accounted for .",
    "we have not done a detailed spectral analysis to determine the stellar makeup but we can use the color gradients to provide some constraints . for the 12 galaxies , the _",
    "largest _ mass - to - light variation from 10  to the center is @xmath62 ; the average is around 0.04 .",
    "models of worthey ( 1994 ) suggest that a @xmath62 imply an mass - to - light change of about 20% .",
    "we do not include that small variation here but note that gebhardt  et  al .",
    "( 2000a ) use an even larger variation and find no change in the measured bh mass .",
    "cappellari  et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) find a similar result for ic1459 .",
    "thus , we conclude that inclusion of a small mass - to - light variation at small radius will have insignificant effect on the bh mass .",
    "the twelve galaxies in this paper all have significant bh detections , with a typical statistical significance in the masses of around 30% .",
    "the average significance of detection is well above 99% and the least significant detection ( ngc  2778 ) has about 90% confidence .",
    "thus , for this sample , every galaxy has a bh .",
    "in fact , only one nearby galaxy with high - resolution spectral data lacks any significant bh detection : the pure disk galaxy m33 ( gebhardt  et  al.2001 ) .",
    "the most obvious difference between m33 and the galaxies with significant bh detection is that the latter have a bulge component .",
    "for a few of these galaxies , ground - based spectra alone yield reasonably precise bh masses .",
    "the masses based on ground - based data alone are generally remarkably close to the masses based on ground - based and _ hst _ data ; there is no evidence that masses based on ground - based data alone are systematically high .",
    "the most important aspect of using ground - based data is assure that the models are fit using full generality ( i.e. , without assumptions about the orbital structure ) .    the most significant correlation with bh mass is with the velocity dispersion .",
    "the present intrinsic scatter is around 0.23 dex in bh mass ( tremaine  et  al .",
    ". it will be extremely illuminating to include more galaxies at both extremes , the low mass and high mass ends .",
    "the next most significant correlation is with the radial - to - tangential velocity dispersion at @xmath44/4 .",
    "we do not know whether this is simply a secondary correlation due to that with the velocity dispersion , or if it represents an evolutionary pattern due to the growth of the bh .",
    "detailed theoretical and n - body models are required to understand this .",
    "the bh mass also significantly correlates with both galaxy bulge luminosity and bulge mass , but neither of these is as strong as with dispersion .",
    "the uncertainties in the bh masses reported here are only statistical .",
    "we have not attempted to include uncertainties from the assumptions in our models or systematic errors in our analysis outlined in  4.9 .",
    "we believe that the increase in the uncertainties is likely to be small , but additional tests are required in order to substantiate this .",
    "we can use the @xmath33 correlation as an approximate constraint on the uncertainties .",
    "if there is an underlying physical mechanism that causes a _ perfect _ correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath42 , then any scatter seen in the correlation must be measurement error . since the current scatter is comparable to the measurement error , we probably have a reasonable estimate of our uncertainties ; any additional uncertainties caused by our assumptions should be smaller than 0.23 dex in bh mass",
    ". however , this argument applies only to random errors .",
    "if , for example , galaxies deviate from our assumptions systematically , then the @xmath33 correlation may still have small scatter but incorrect bh masses .",
    "the only way to test this is to include a larger sample with general dynamical models that cover a wide variety of input configurations .",
    "the orbit - based models provide a look into the internal orbital structure of an axisymmetric system .",
    "based on the small sample of galaxies shown here and the limited theoretical comparisons , we are already able to place some constraints on the possible evolutionary history of the galaxy .",
    "the results in this paper suggest that core galaxies have tangentially biased orbits near their centers , while power - law galaxies show a range of tangential relative to radial motion . as suggested by faber",
    "et  al .  ( 1997 ) and ravindranath  et  al.(2002 ) , it appears that the core galaxies are consistent with the bh / binary models , and the power - law galaxies are more consistent with adiabatic growth .",
    "this conclusion comes from analysis of the stellar surface brightness profiles , and now a similar conclusion comes from the stellar kinematics .",
    "significant improvement in our understanding of the orbital structure will come from datasets with two - dimensional kinematics .",
    "de  zeeuw  et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) and bacon  et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) present examples of datasets that can be exploited for this analysis .",
    "however , in order to make progress in this area we must understand possible systematic biases that can arise from various assumptions ( e.g. , dark halo , different deprojections , lack of axial symmetry , etc . )",

    "the ground - based velocities and dispersions for ngc  3377 come from kormendy  et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) and will not be repeated here .",
    "since our models use the losvds , we convert from the first two moments to the velocity profile using monte carlo simulations .",
    "each velocity profile realization is a gaussian with the mean chosen from a random draw from the measured mean using its uncertainty , and the sigma chosen from a random draw from the measured dispersion using its uncertainty .",
    "this procedure does not take into account the h3 and h4 components that are likely to be non - zero .",
    "however , the model results depend very little on the higher order moments , since it is mainly the radial run of the first two moments that determine the bh mass .",
    "the height of the losvd at a given velocity is then the mean of the simulations and the uncertainty is given by the 68% confidence bands of the simulations .    for ngc  5845",
    ", the data were taken with the mdm telescope . the observational setup and",
    "reductions are similar to those outlined in pinkney  et  al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "we used the ca  ii triplet region around 8500   .",
    "the plate scale is 0.59  per pixel .",
    "the wavelength scale is 1.44    per pixel , with an instrumental resolution of 0.75    or 26  @xmath7 .",
    "we observed along three position angles for ngc  5845 : 0 , 22 , and 90  ( defined from the major axis to the minor axis ) , with total exposure times of 3 hours for each position angle ( 9 hours in total ) . in table  4 , we report the first four velocity moments of the losvd for the three position angles .",
    "they are plotted in figure  a14 .    for the fos data ,",
    "the reduction procedure is similar to that in gebhardt  et  al .",
    "( 2000a ) .",
    "both galaxies were observed using the 0.21  square aperture . the wavelength range , 45666815   , includes the mg  i  _ b _ lines near 5175   .",
    "the spectral dispersion is 1.09    pixel@xmath2 .",
    "the instrumental velocity dispersion is @xmath63fwhm/2.35@xmath64 pixels = @xmath65  @xmath7  ( internal error ) .",
    "this width is intrinsic to the instrument and is not strongly affected by how the aperture is illuminated ( keyes  et  al .",
    "we therefore make no aperture illumination corrections to the measured velocity dispersion .",
    "flat fielding and correction for geomagnetically induced motions ( gim ) were done as in kormendy  et  al .",
    "the flat - field image uses the same aperture .",
    "each galaxy exposure is divided into multiple subintegrations during the visits .",
    "there are four individual exposures for ngc  5845 with a total integration time of 2.43 hours .",
    "for ngc  3377 , the central pointing had a single exposure of 0.66 hours , and two flanking exposures on both sides of the galaxy of 1.02 and 0.90 hours ( each split into two subintegrations ) .",
    "the most important step is to determine where the slit was actually placed . for ngc  3379 ( gebhardt  et  al .",
    "2002a ) , this was a critical issue since the aperture was not placed exactly in the center of the galaxy . for both ngc  3377 and ngc  5845",
    ", the aperture placement is much more secure since both galaxies have central cusps .",
    "since we take a setup image of the galaxy before the spectral observations , we know where the aperture was placed . for both galaxies , the center of the galaxy is at the center of the fos aperture to better than 0.05 . for ngc  3377",
    ", we have two additional apertures placed 0.2  away from the center along the major axis on opposite sides .",
    "we have checked their placement using the setup images and confirm that they were both placed at the requested position to within 0.05 . since the flanking spectra were placed at very similar radii on opposite sides of the galaxy , we have fit the same velocity profile , but appropriately flipped , to both spectra .",
    "this fit is the same as that done for all of the other data used in the models .",
    "table  4 , therefore , only reports the moments for one profile fitted to both spectra .",
    "we have three template stars taken with the same fos aperture , and all three provide similar results for the kinematics .",
    "table  4 includes the gauss - hermite moments for the single pointing for ngc  5845 and the two pointings for ngc  3377 .",
    "extraction of the losvd for the three _ hst _ spectra and the ground - based spectra use the procedure described by gebhardt  et  al.(2000a ) and pinkney  et  al .",
    "( 2002a ) .",
    "we use the full losvd in the models , but we report only its first four moments in table  4 .    lcccccccccc n821 & e4 & @xmath6620.41 & @xmath67 & 209 & 24.1 & 7.6,@xmath3 & 1.4 & 0.37 & 0.88 &
