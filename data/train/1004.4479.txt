    "the spontaneous - emission rate of an excited atom can be altered by the atomic environment , as has been pointed out long ago @xcite . for an atom embedded in a uniform linear non - absorptive dielectric of infinite extent",
    "the change in the emission rate has been obtained from quantum electrodynamics @xcite . for dense media local - field effects",
    "have to be considered as well @xcite .",
    "if the medium can absorb the emitted photons , the analysis gets more complicated , since the loss mechanism has to be treated in a quantum - mechanical context @xcite - @xcite .",
    "local - field effects do not play a role if a different geometry is considered , with the atom situated outside a medium of finite ( or semi - infinite ) extent .",
    "a well - known case is that of an atom in front of a medium that fills a half - space . for this configuration",
    "the decay rate depends on the distance between the atom and the medium @xcite - @xcite .    in all treatments mentioned so far",
    "the medium is structureless on the scale of the wavelength corresponding to the atomic transition . as a consequence ,",
    "the medium properties are fully described by a susceptibility , which does not vary appreciably on the scale of the wavelength .",
    "the picture changes if the structure of the medium can not be neglected , since scattering may occur then as well .",
    "the total extinction in such a medium is driven by both absorption and scattering . in practice ,",
    "extinction by scattering in material media is quite common .",
    "impurities and defects both lead to scattering effects that are difficult to avoid .    to study the interplay between the two types of extinction that may modify atomic decay processes in the presence of a material medium , it is useful to analyse a model in which both of these features occur simultaneously .",
    "the model that we shall adopt in the following is that of a medium consisting of non - overlapping spheres that are made of an absorptive material .",
    "the spheres , which may move freely through the system , are distributed randomly with a uniform average density . in a recent paper @xcite a similar model with a collection of spherical scatterers consisting of non - absorptive material has been studied .    in order to describe the absorptive dielectric material of the spheres we shall use the quantum - mechanical damped - polariton model .",
    "the central quantity in this model is a space - dependent polarization density , which is coupled to the electromagnetic field and to a bath of harmonic oscillators accounting for absorption .",
    "the hamiltonian of the damped - polariton model can be diagonalized exactly , as has been shown both for the case of a uniform dielectric @xcite and for a dielectric with arbitrary inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "to arrive at analytical results for the decay rate in the presence of a medium with extinction due to both absorption and scattering we will adopt several approximations . the density of the spherical scatterers will supposed to be low , so that the medium is dilute .",
    "furthermore , the size of the spheres will be taken to be small as compared to the atomic wavelength .",
    "finally , the distance from the excited atom to the medium will be chosen to be large compared to the wavelength .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 the properties of the model and its diagonalization",
    "will be summarized . in section 3 the decay rate of an excited atom in the presence of an arbitrarily inhomogeneous damped - polariton dielectric",
    "will be derived from the basic hamiltonian .",
    "the decay rate is determined by the electromagnetic green function , which enters the description via a specific coefficient in the diagonalization matrix .",
    "since the medium consists of randomly distributed spheres the green function has to be averaged over all configurations in order to obtain the physical decay rate .",
    "this averaging procedure will be discussed in section 4 and 5 . as it turns out",
    ", the averaging process for a medium that fills a finite region of space ( or a half - space ) should be carried out carefully , since the boundaries give rise to specific surface contributions .",
    "once these surface effects have been evaluated for the specific case of a medium filling a half - space , we can obtain the average decay rate of an excited atom in the presence of such a medium .",
    "the change in the atomic decay rate as a function of the distance between atom and medium will be determined in section 6 , and the interplay of absorption and scattering processes will become clear .",
    "some of the technical details of the derivation are given in two appendices .",
    "in the damped - polariton model the dielectric medium is described by a polarization density , which interacts with the electromagnetic field according to the standard minimal - coupling scheme . to account for absorption effects a bath of harmonic oscillators with a continuous range of eigenfrequencies",
    "is coupled to the polarization density in a bilinear way .",

    ", the minimal - coupling scheme leads to an electrostatic contribution involving @xmath9_l$ ] and to a bilinear interaction term with @xmath10 .",
    "the longitudinal part of a vector ( or a tensor ) is obtained by a convolution with the longitudinal delta function @xmath11 . finally , damping is introduced in the system by a continuum bath of harmonic oscillators with canonical variables @xmath12 , @xmath13 and with eigenfrequencies @xmath14 .",
