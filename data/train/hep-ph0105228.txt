    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite is currently the leading candidate for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . at the tree  level the higgs sector of",
    "the mssm takes the form of a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , where the coefficients of the quartic scalar terms are functions of the electroweak gauge couplings @xcite .",
    "five physical higgs bosons are predicted : a charged pair ( @xmath6,@xmath7 ) , two cp  even scalars ( @xmath8,@xmath2 ) , and a cp  odd @xmath3 . in the tree ",
    "level approximation the lightest higgs @xmath8 satisfies @xmath9 , while @xmath10 for @xmath11 gev .",
    "only two parameters are needed to fully parametrize the tree ",
    "level potential , and these are usually taken to be @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the vacuum expectation value of a higgs doublet ) and one of @xmath15 .    at the 1loop level",
    "the coefficients in the higgs potential receive contributions from virtual particle loops and thus become complicated functions of several ( susy ) parameters .",
    "in addition , new quartic scalar terms are generated .",
    "this changes the tree ",
    "level mass relationships , most notably weakening the above mass bound to @xmath16 gev @xcite . the near degeneracy relationship , @xmath17 for the large ( @xmath18 gev ) mass region ,",
    "is only slightly affected , resulting in mass splittings of @xmath19 gev .",
    "recently there has been much interest in the 1loop effective potential of the mssm with unconstrained cp violating phases @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the mass splitting between the two heavier neutral scalars ( now mixed states of cp ) can be increased up to 30 gev for large phases .    in this paper",
    "we will show that large mass splittings between the charged and neutral higgs bosons , @xmath20 gev , are possible in the cp conserving mssm in a previously ignored parameter space .",
    "these large splittings occur when @xmath4 is larger than the supersymmetric ( susy ) scale ( defined as the arithmetic mean of the stop masses ) by a factor of 4 or more .",
    "although sizeable corrections to the tree  level mass sum rules can be implicitly found in previous works e.g. @xcite , we identify the parameter space for the largest splittings and discuss the phenomenological consequences .",
    "importantly we show that this parameter space is consistent with current experiments .",
    "such splittings would break the commonly assumed degeneracy relation @xmath10 for @xmath11 gev , which should no longer be taken as a prediction of the mssm .",
    "the higgs mass spectrum of the mssm may resemble that of a general 2hdm or other extended ( susy ) higgs sectors with scalar singlets etc .",
    "knowledge of the maximum possible mass splittings among the higgs bosons in the mssm may be crucial in distinguishing different models at future colliders .",
    "in particular , measurements of the mass splittings provide important information on the structure of the underlying higgs sector , especially since higgs branching ratios ( br ) and cross  sections are often very similar in many popular models .",
    "moreover , new decays channels involving @xmath1,@xmath2 and @xmath3 would be open and may possess large branching ratios , thus affecting proposed mssm higgs search strategies at future colliders .",
    "our work is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline our approach for evaluating the mass splittings .",
    "section 3 presents our numerical results , while section 4 contains our conclusions .",
    "the most general cp violating higgs potential of the mssm may be described by the following effective lagrangian :    @xmath21    at tree  level @xmath22 are functions of the @xmath23 and @xmath24 gauge couplings while @xmath25 . in the 1-loop effective potential all @xmath26 receive sizeable corrections from the enhanced yukawa couplings of the third generation squarks . in particular @xmath27 and are complex in the presence of susy phases in @xmath28,@xmath29 and @xmath4 .",
    "explicit formulae may be found in @xcite .",
    "the restricted form of the tree ",
    "level potential limits the possible mass splittings between @xmath30,@xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath30 and @xmath32 are related by : @xmath33 at tree ",
    "level @xmath34 and @xmath35 , and the above relationship reduces to the familiar sum rule @xmath36 with the current lep bound of @xmath37 gev one finds @xmath38 gev , with approximate degeneracy for @xmath39 gev .",
    "at the 1loop level @xmath40 and @xmath41 may be written as ( keeping the dominant terms ) : @xmath42           \\nonumber\\\\   & & + { 3\\over { 8\\pi^2}}h_t^2h_b^2\\left[{1\\over 2}x_{tb}\\right ] \\\\   \\lambda_5 & \\approx &   { 3\\over{192\\pi^2}}\\left [ h_t^4\\left({\\mu^2 a_t^2\\over m^4_{susy}}\\right ) + h_b^4\\left({\\mu^2 a_b^2\\over m^4_{susy}}\\right)\\right ] \\nonumber \\label{eq : lam45}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is a function of @xmath28,@xmath29 , @xmath5 and @xmath4 . from now on we will focus on the case of @xmath44 being real , with mention given to the case of complex phases where appropriate .",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "( 4 ) that @xmath45 or @xmath46 would overcome much of the suppression from the small coefficients , permitting @xmath47 . from eq .",
    "( 2 ) this would give rise to large mass differences @xmath48 .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( 2 ) that @xmath49 requires @xmath50 while @xmath51 requires @xmath52 .",
    "we note that both terms in @xmath41 are positive definite and the term proportional to @xmath53 will dominate unless @xmath12 is large ( which enhances @xmath54 ) . in the expression for @xmath40",
    "there may be both constructive and destructive interference among the various terms and so the susy correction to the tree  level value may take either sign .    for the cp even higgs bosons",
    "one has a mass matrix @xmath55 which when diagonalized gives the mass eigenstates @xmath8 and @xmath2 .",
    "note that the 1loop corrected @xmath55 involves all @xmath26 , @xmath56 , and its explicit form may be found in @xcite . of interest to us",
    "is the mass splitting between @xmath30 and @xmath31 which may be given approximately by : @xmath57    recently it has been shown that the susy radiative corrections to the effective yukawa couplings @xcite can be important ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "such corrections comprise loops involving gluino  sbottom and chargino  stop .",
    "the modified @xmath54 has already been shown to sizeably affect @xmath58 @xcite,@xcite , the effective @xmath59 coupling @xcite , and the higgs decay @xmath60 @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to @xmath61 , which is the region where the above corrections to @xmath54 have minor impact .",
    "note that such large mass splittings occur more naturally in extended versions of the mssm which include a singlet higgs field in the superpotential e.g. @xcite . in such models",
    "( 2 ) is modified to include a term @xmath62 , where @xmath63 ( @xmath64 is the vacuum expectation value of the singlet higgs field ) .",
    "thus @xmath65 ( i.e. gauge coupling strength ) may be attained with @xmath66 gev , giving rise to large mass splittings .",
    "we now present our numerical results for the mass splittings @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we take two representative sets of parameters : set ( a ) gives large @xmath67 , and set ( b ) gives large @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 here all masses are in gev ; @xmath70 refer to third generation squark soft susy breaking masses ; @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the analogous trilinear couplings .",
    "we take @xmath4 and @xmath71 to be real in the numerical analysis . for these values of @xmath12",
    "the terms @xmath72 dominate the terms @xmath73 in the expressions for the @xmath26 .",
    "we define @xmath5 as @xmath74 where @xmath75 and @xmath76 refer to the lighter and heavier stop eigenstates respectively . for set(a ) @xmath77 gev and for set(b ) @xmath78 gev . for",
    "both parameter sets the mass splitting @xmath79 comfortably satisfies the rg analysis requirement @xcite @xmath80 note that the large value of @xmath4 taken in set ( a ) and ( b ) does not imply an unacceptably light @xmath75 , since the corresponding entry in the stop mass matrix is @xmath81 , which is comfortably suppressed for the assumed values of @xmath12 .",
    "larger values of @xmath12 together with large @xmath4 would invariably generate values of @xmath82 which are lighter than the current experimental bounds .",
    "we also require that all @xmath26 remain in the perturbative region .    in fig .  1 ( a ) and ( b ) , we plot @xmath67 and @xmath68 as a function of @xmath12 for @xmath4=@xmath83 gev ( from above ) and @xmath4=@xmath84 gev ( from above ) , respectively",
    "for the other parameters we take the choices in ( [ sets ] ) .    in both figs .  1 and 2 , the line in thin typeset signifies that the corresponding mass for one of @xmath75 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 becomes smaller than the present experimental bound",
    ".    in fig .",
    "1(a ) , we can understand the behaviour of the splittings @xmath67 from eqns.(4 ) and ( [ splita ] ) . in eq .",
    "( 4 ) , increasing @xmath12 enhances the term @xmath87 which is negative in this parameter space , and thus reduces the positive @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 is also positive and is not so sensitive to @xmath12 since the top quark yukawa term dominates .",
    "however , @xmath90 is negative and its modulus becomes smaller as @xmath12 increases .",
    "the combined effect is as follows : for small @xmath12 the negative term in eq .",
    "( 5 ) cancels the positive terms and the splitting is small .",
    "as @xmath12 increases the positive terms dominate , giving rise to large splittings .",
    "further increases in @xmath12 reduce the still positive @xmath40 , while @xmath41 remains approximately constant , which explains the descent of the curve for larger @xmath12 .",
    "we have also checked that the splittings are relatively insensitive to variations in @xmath29 since the relevant terms are suppressed by @xmath91 .",
    "one might expect that the splittings could be further increased by changing the sign of @xmath28 , which makes @xmath92 positive .",
    "however it is not easy to satisfy the scalar quark mass bound with this choice in the cp conserving scenario .",
    "larger values of @xmath4 give rise to larger splittings , which is explained in fig .",
    "2(a ) below .    in fig .",
    "1(b ) one can see that @xmath68 increases with @xmath12 , which is explained by the fact that @xmath40 is decreasing ( see above ) and thus enhances the splitting from eq .",
    "large @xmath4 provides the largest splittings ( see below ) .    in fig .  2 ( a ) we plot @xmath67 as a function of @xmath93 for @xmath94 gev ( from above )",
    "for the other parameters we take the choices in ( [ sets ] ) . in fig .  2 ( a ) , we can see that @xmath95 allows splittings @xmath96 gev .",
    "increasing @xmath28 enhances the positive contributions to @xmath97 and @xmath89 , which in turn enhances @xmath67 ( from eq .",
    "( [ splita ] ) ) .    in fig .  2 ( b ) , we plot @xmath68 as a function of @xmath93 for @xmath98 gev ( from above ) , since it turns out that the splittings are not very sensitive to @xmath28 .",
    "as expected , we can see the decoupling behaviour , with the splitting decreasing for increasing @xmath30 . for low values of @xmath93 the 1-loop corrections",
    "are not so large and so one has approximately the tree ",
    "level result @xmath99 .",
    "as @xmath93 increases , @xmath41 is enhanced to large positive values .",
    "in addition , @xmath40 is decreased from its positive tree - level value .",
    "hence the mass splitting @xmath100 increases and exceeds 80 gev for @xmath101 .",
    "if cp violating phases are allowed in @xmath4 and @xmath71 then @xmath102 become complex numbers in general .",
    "the mass eigenstates @xmath103 and @xmath104 are now mixed states of cp , and the large splittings @xmath105 or @xmath106 are possible in a wider range of parameter space which satisfies the mass bounds on @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( @xmath109 ) .    the magnitude of the mass splittings has important consequences for the phenomenology of the mssm .",
    "our results show that @xmath30 need not be close in mass to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and the mass differences @xmath110 may be as large as the analogous values in a general 2hdm or in other extended higgs sectors .",
    "the relation @xmath111 for @xmath112 gev , which is assumed in existing phenomenological analyses , may be broken in the region of large @xmath93 .",
    "we stress that the large values of @xmath4 considered here do not arise in popular susy models , such as minimal supergravity or gauge mediated models . as discussed in @xcite , in order to be compatible with electroweak symmetry breaking , such large values of @xmath4 would require the soft susy breaking mass parameters @xmath113 and @xmath114 to be of the order of @xmath115 and negative , and considerable fine - tuning is necessary .",
    "if @xmath116 gev then the 2 body decays @xmath117 would be open .",
    "this would offer a new discovery channel for @xmath1 at the lhc , and one which is expected to offer a very promising signature . ref .",
    "@xcite presented a signal  background analysis showing that the background is small , and any model which allows a large br(@xmath118 ) would provide a very clear signal in this channel .",
    "we shall show below that such large brs are possible in the mssm , and consequently would aid the search for @xmath1 at the lhc .",
    "if @xmath119 gev then the 2 body decays @xmath120 would be open .",
    "this would have important consequences for the process @xmath121 at a muon collider , which receives contributions from @xmath122 mediated s ",
    "channel diagrams , and was shown to be a promising production mechanism for @xmath123 in the mssm with @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "any splittings with @xmath125 would enhance the rate for @xmath126 ) compared to that in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath119 gev one could have resonant @xmath1 production via @xmath127 , which was shown to allow very large cross  sections ( @xmath128 pb ) in the case of the general 2hdm @xcite .",
    "these possibilities will be pursued in a future article @xcite .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot branching ratios ( brs ) for the decay @xmath117 as a function of @xmath12 .",
    "this two body decay is open if @xmath116 gev , and is proportional to @xmath129 .",
    "also plotted is br(@xmath130 ) which @xmath131 .",
    "we take the same parameters as fig .  1 ( a ) .",
    "the thick ( thin ) lines represent br(@xmath132 ) for @xmath133 ( from above ) , respectively .",
    "note that we do not consider decays to susy particles @xmath134 , @xmath135 etc .",
    "the decays @xmath136 are not open for this choice of @xmath30 and @xmath137 can be closed by choosing suitable values for @xmath138,@xmath139 etc .",
    "it can be seen from fig.3 that br@xmath140 is attainable for intermediate values of @xmath12 , clearly showing the importance of this new decay channel .",
    "the behaviour of the brs can be qualitatively understood as follows : for low @xmath12 the splittings are not large enough to open the channel and for large @xmath12 the newly opened channel @xmath117 can not compete with the fermionic decay modes .",
    "thus the maximum inpact of @xmath118 decays is for intermediate values of @xmath12 , which is the most problematic region for the @xmath123 search at the lhc .",
    "the current search strategies utilize @xmath141 decays @xcite , which is most effective for @xmath142 , or @xmath143 decays which cover the regions @xmath144 and @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "we can also see that br(@xmath146 ) , although suppressed in the decoupling limit , can be significant .",
    "the sizeable brs shown in fig .",
    "3 would offer very good detection prospects in these channels @xcite .",
    "in general , the mass splittings presented here may give rise to a large contribution to the precisely measured electroweak parameter @xmath147 . for mass splittings @xmath148 gev we find that the higgs contribution is always positive and violates the @xmath149 constraint at the @xmath150 level for @xmath151 gev . the dominant susy particle contribution ( @xmath152 loops ) to @xmath149 has the same sign as the higgs contribution @xcite , thus further reducing the maximum allowed value of @xmath110 .",
    "therefore the mass splittings @xmath110 presented here are consistent with the @xmath149 constraints .",
    "we have shown that very large mass splittings @xmath153 are possible in the mssm .",
    "such splittings occur in a previously ignored region of the mssm parameter space and may exceed 100 gev , thus strongly violating the commonly assumed degeneracy relation @xmath154 .",
    "the largest splittings arise for relatively large @xmath155 .",
    "the previously neglected 2 body decays @xmath118 and @xmath156 may become the dominant channels , which would have important consequences for higgs searches at future colliders .",
    "if @xmath157 gev , a muon collider could copiously produce @xmath1 at resonance .",
    "we thank a. arhrib , p. ko and y. okada for useful comments .",
    "we are grateful to c. wagner for confirming some of the results presented here .",
