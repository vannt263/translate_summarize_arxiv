    "one commonly used egm is earth gravitational model 1996 ( egm96 ) .",

    "for example , at the position of the blanco 4-m telescope , the ( egm84 , egm96 , and egm2008 ] ) earth gravitational models predict geoid heights @xmath12 = ( 31.41 , 34.62 , 33.31 ) meters .",
    "hence , the definition of `` mean sea level '' under the observatories has varied at the @xmath1few meter level over the past decades . throughout this paper ,",

    "_ to what degree are cerro tololo and cerro pachn moving due to plate tectonics ? _ while the common perception is that chile is moving westward with the south american tectonic plate , there are surprisingly large variations in the plate motion in chile .",
    "these large variations are traced through time series gps measurements of ground stations in chile maintained by the jet propulsion laboratory .",
    "generally , stations north of santiago ( santiago , valparaso , copiap , iqueque ) are moving _",
    "northeast _ with respect to wgs  84 at @xmath030 mm / yr , while chilean stations south of santiago are moving _",
    "northwest _ at @xmath090 mm / yr . although i have been unable to find accurate geodetic motions for cerro tololo and cerro pachn in particular , judging by the measurements for other well - studied benchmarks in chile , it is very likely that the peaks are moving at @xmath14100 mm / yr , and most likely @xmath1430 mm / yr .",

    "hence , over the five decade history of the observatory , the site has very likely moved @xmath145 m ( and indeed the unavco plate motion calculator would predict only @xmath00.5 m of motion over 50 years ) . in summary ,",
    "any deviations in the published positions for the observatory larger than these amounts are unlikely to be attributable to tectonic motion , especially on short timescales .",

    "these positions were presumably adopted from the ctio facilities manual ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the aa ceased listing positions for individual telescopes at observatories after the mid-80 s , and provided only mean positions for observatories thereafter .",

    ", i decided to correct gps , google earth , and 1973 survey elevations to the geodetic elevation system defined by the 2008 survey ( close enough to wgs  84 to be practically considered wgs  84 ) :    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    the difference between the google  earth elevations and the 2008 survey geodetic heights @xmath11 are close enough to the egm-96 geoid undulations @xmath12 (",

    "the difference between the gps elevations and 2008 survey heights do not appear to correspond to either zero ( if the gps elevations were actually geodetic heights ) , or any of the widely used geoid undulations .",
    "hence , i simply add a constant to the gps elevations and place them on the wgs  84 geodetic height scale .",
    "the difference between the 2008 survey geodetic heights and the 1973 survey elevations ( 31.3 m ) is remarkably similar to the geoid undulation heights (  2 ; especially for the wgs  84 ellipsoid ) , suggesting that the zero point for the 1973 survey elevations is indeed within a few meters of recent geoid models .",
    "best estimates for the geodetic and geocentric positions of the observatories on cerro tololo and cerro pachn are listed in table [ tab : final ] .",
    "final elevations taking into account the offsets in elevations discussed in the last section are also included , along with geoid undulation heights @xmath12 based on the egm-96 model .",
    "it appears that using google earth one can derive geodetic wgs  84 coordinates for observatories and structures to approximately @xmath10.15 ( 5  m ) accuracy in latitude and longitude without resorting to more accurate techniques ( i.e. gps , surveying ) .",

    "the rms scatter in positions derived via gps and google  earth is approximately 0.14 ( 4  m ) . treating the gps and google  earth positions as independent estimates , and correcting the google  earth positions for small systematic differences at the 0.1 ( 3  m ) level",
    ", one can derive final mean positions for structures on cerro tololo and pachn with absolute accuracy @xmath10.1 ( 3  m ) .",
    "one can obviously do better if needed through long integrations of gps determinations , or theodolite observations tied to monuments with well - constrained geodetic positions , however this would obviously require more time and money ( which always seem to be in short supply ) .",
    "while _ astronomical _ coordinates have not been determined for all of the observatories on cerro tololo and cerro pachn ( an arduous task ) , one can derive approximate astronomical coordinates by adding an offset derived from harrington et al.s ( 1972 ) observations :          besides the obvious ( and explainable ) disagreement between the geodetic and astronomical positions for cerro tololo (  [ 1972 ] ) , there was at least one other surprise in comparing the final positions in table [ tab : final ] with the previously published positions in table [ tab : old ] .",
