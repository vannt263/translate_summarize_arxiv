    "<S> we present results from two @xmath0 direct numerical simulations of rotating turbulence where both energy and helicity are injected into the flow by an external forcing . the dual cascade of energy and helicity towards smaller scales observed in isotropic and homogeneous turbulence is broken in the presence of rotation , with the development of an inverse cascade of energy now coexisting with direct cascades of energy and helicity . in the direct cascade range , </S>",
    "<S> the flux of helicity dominates over that of energy at low rossby number . </S>",
    "<S> these cascades have several consequences for the statistics of the flow . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of global quantities and of the energy and helicity spectra is studied , and comparisons with simulations at different reynolds and rossby numbers at lower resolution are done to identify scaling laws . </S>"
