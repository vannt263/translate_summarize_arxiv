    "these problems have been widely studied when @xmath9 is uniformly continuous with respect to the lebesgue measure , i.e. when the support has full dimension .",
    "we refer to @xcite and @xcite for precursor works on support estimation , @xcite for a review on support estimation , @xcite for boundary estimation , @xcite for boundary measure estimation , @xcite for integrated mean curature estimation or @xcite for recognition of topological properties having a support estimator homeomorphic to the support .",
    "the lower dimensional case ( that is , when the support of the distribution is a @xmath13-dimensional manifold with @xmath14 ) has recently gained relevance due to its connection with nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques ( also known as _",
    "manifold learning _ ) , as well as _",
    "persistent homology_. see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "considering support estimation it would be natural to think that some of the proposed estimators ( in the full dimensional framework ) are still suitable , but , when considering boundary , estimation it is not possible to directly adapt the methods .",
    "indeed , in the full dimensional case , the boundary is estimated by the boundary of the estimator .    unfortunately , when the support estimator is full dimensional ( which is typically the case ) this idea is hopeless .    to illustrate this , consider the devroye - wise support estimator .",
    "it is defined ( see @xcite ) as @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the closed ball ( in @xmath10 ) of radius @xmath17 centered at @xmath18 . in the `` full dimensional case '' , under some conditions on @xmath11 and @xmath19 ,",
    "it can be proved ( see @xcite ) that @xmath20 is a consistent estimator of @xmath12 . however , when the support is a @xmath13-dimensional manifold with @xmath14 , is is easy to see that @xmath20 is never a consistent estimator .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : dw ] , in the case @xmath21 .",
    ", in the one dimensional case . ]",
    "even if there exist some support estimators which are @xmath22dimensional , based on some restriction on the delaunay complex , to our knowledge they have only been studied recently , in the case of support with no boundary ( see @xcite ) . +",
    "before trying to estimate the boundary of the support , in the lower dimensional case , one has to be able to decide whether it has a boundary or not .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to propose a hypothesis test to address that problem .    in order to explain the idea of the test ,",
    "let us assume that the support @xmath1 , is a smooth @xmath13-dimensional manifold and the distribution @xmath23 has a continuous density .",
    "given a point @xmath24 and a integer @xmath4 , we consider the subsample @xmath25 of the @xmath2nearest neighbors to @xmath18 in the sample .",
    "we set @xmath26 the distance to the @xmath2nearest neighbor and @xmath27 .",
    "assume that @xmath28 slowly enough to also have @xmath29 .",
    "heuristically , suppose first that @xmath30 .",
    "then , for all @xmath18 , the smoothness of the manifold , the continuity of the density and @xmath31 ensures that the `` locally rescaled sample '' : @xmath32 is `` close '' to a uniformly drawn sample on a @xmath13 dimensional unit ball .",
    "then , as @xmath33 we expect to have @xmath34 .",
    "thus we can naturally expect that @xmath35 .",
    "second , suppose that @xmath36 is a @xmath37 manifold then , if @xmath38 , with the same kind of argument , the `` locally rescaled sample '' is close to a uniformly drawn sample on a half unit ball and @xmath39 with @xmath40 a positive constant .",
    "thus one can naturally expect to have @xmath41 , and that @xmath42 .",
    "thus it seems natural to decide @xmath30 if @xmath43 is small enough .",
    "the proposed test is based on this idea .",
