    "the investigation of particle motion in periodic potentials has obvious relevance in condensed matter studies .",
    "motion of ions in a crystalline lattice is a case in point .",
    "stochasticity in the motion is naturally introduced at nonzero temperatures . in these environment",
    "the particle motion can be approximately described by a langevin equation with suitable model potentials .",
    "depending on the problem at hand the motion is either considered heavily damped , almost undamped , or in the intermediate situation mildly damped ( or underdamped ) .",
    "in many a situations in the former two extreme cases the langevin equation becomes amenable to analytical solution . however , in the underdamped situation , barring a few special cases , numerical methods are used to solve the equation of motion of the particle@xcite .",
    "owing to various kinds of errors and approximations involved in these ( numerical ) methods exact quantitative solutions are not possible .",
    "however , the method can reveal useful qualitative trends in the behaviour of the particle motion .",
    "for instance , recently it was shown@xcite that a particle , moving in an asymmetric but periodic potential in the presence of thermal noise when subjected to a symmetric periodic external drive ( which adds to zero when averaged over a period ) , acquires a net motion when the parameters of the problem are chosen suitably .",
    "such a net particle current without the application of any external bias or potential gradient in the presence of thermal noise is called thermal ratchet current and the system giving such a current is termed as thermal ratchet@xcite . here the equilibrium condition of detailed balance is not applicable because the system was driven far away from equilibrium by rocking it periodically in the presence of noise .",
    "it was further shown that this system can even exhibit absolute negative mobility@xcite .",
    "this prediction has already been found to be true experimentally@xcite .",
    "it shows that in underdamped conditions or in the inertial regime diverse possibilities can be ( qualitatively ) uncovered by ( numerically ) solving the equations of motion .    in the above important example the potential asymmetry was one of the necessary conditions for realization of ratchet current .",
    "the particle had to surmount the same potential barrier on either direction ; only the slopes leading to the top of the barrier differed . a sinusoidal potential , for example , having no such asymmetry",
    "would not have yielded the ratchet current . in the present work",
    ", we consider similar particle motion in a sinusoidal potential .",
    "however , instead of a uniform friction coefficient of the medium we consider a model nonuniform space - dependent friction coefficient @xmath4 of the medium . in particular",
    ", we consider a sinusoidally varying @xmath4 exactly similar to the potential but with a phase lag , @xmath5 .",
    "a simple illustrative example of the model can be imagined thus : a stationary pressure wave is established in air giving a periodic @xmath4 for particle motion along @xmath6 .",
    "an array of ions with the periodicity of @xmath7 but shifted a little to give a phase lag @xmath5 will just fit our model for a charged particle motion along @xmath6 . here",
    "the potential is symmetric and periodic .",
    "however , the directional symmetry of the system is disturbed by a phase shift in the similarly periodic @xmath4 .",
    "particle motion along an one dimensional semiconductor heterostructure or protein motor motion on the surface of a microtubule along its axis would be some practical situations close to the above example . though we do not have any microscopic basis for justifying the model form of @xmath4 a periodic variation of friction",
    "has been argued earlier from mode - coupling theory of adatom motion on the surface of a crystal of identical atoms@xcite .",
    "also , the equation of motion has a direct correspondence with the resistively and capacitatively shunted junction ( rcsj ) model of josephson junctions ; the term describing the nonuniformity of friction having an one - to - one correspondence with the @xmath8 term in the rcsj model@xcite . a qualitative physical argument for the possibility of obtaining ratchet current in this inhomogeneous system was given in an earlier work@xcite .",
    "we drive the system with a square - wave periodic field .",
    "the resulting langevin equation is solved numerically .",
    "we obtain particle current and properties associated with it in the parameter space of external field amplitude @xmath0 , the average friction coefficient @xmath9 , the phase lag @xmath5 , and the temperature @xmath10 . since it is a formidable task to explore the entire parameter space , we present results for only some regions of a few sections of this space where appreciable ratchet current is obtained .",
    "the ratchet current is obtained in the steady state situation which is achieved in the asymptotic time limit . in our case",
    "we observe particle motion for a long time @xmath1 such that the position dispersion @xmath11 averaged over many similar trajectories reach the situation where @xmath12 .",
    "if the phase lag @xmath5 is considered equal to @xmath13 @xmath14 there will be no ratchet current , @xmath15 , since in this case both the directions of @xmath6 are identical in all respects .",
    "however , when @xmath16 appreciable @xmath15 is obtained in a small range of @xmath0 with a peak in an intermediate @xmath0 for given @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath5 .    in an earlier work@xcite the variation of ratchet current @xmath15 as a function of the amplitude @xmath0 of the applied square - wave forcing @xmath17 , with a frequency of @xmath18 cycles per unit time , was shown ( fig.5 of ref.@xcite ) for the two cases , adiabatic drive and square - wave drive for @xmath19 and temperature @xmath20 .",
    "the range of @xmath0 over which ratchet current is obtained in the square - wave drive case was wider [ @xmath21 compared to the adiabatic drive condition [ @xmath22 and the peak current also occurs at a larger @xmath0 value .",
    "the range , though wider , still remains well below @xmath23 , the critical field at which the potential barrier to motion just disappears .",
    "the current is , therefore , essentially aided by thermal noise .    since in the steady state @xmath12",
    "we can define the diffusion constant @xmath2 : @xmath24 .",
    "interestingly , for given @xmath25 , and @xmath5 , the diffusion constant @xmath2 shows nonmonotonic behaviour with the field amplitude @xmath0 and it peaks around a value of @xmath0 where @xmath15 attains maximum at the drive frequency of @xmath18 cycles per unit time .",
    "that is to say the ratchet current is maximised when the system is most diffusive . to compare the extent of this diffusive spread with the directional average displacement a quantity , pclet number @xmath26 ,",
    "is defined as the ratio of square of mean displacement @xmath27 in time @xmath1 to half the square of diffusive spread in the same time interval @xmath1 @xcite : @xmath28 thus , if @xmath29 the motion is dominated by directional transport and hence it is considered coherent otherwise the net displacement is overwhelmed by diffusive motion .",
    "our calculation shows that in the region where the ratchet current is appreciable and in particular where @xmath15 peaks @xmath26 is much larger than 2 . here",
    "the ratchet current is obtained when there was neither a bias to help the system nor any load to oppose it .",
    "the current , however , is not large enough and when a small load is applied against current the current either reduces to a small level or starts flowing in the direction of the applied load .",
    "thus , in the given circumstances , no appreciable useful work can be extracted from this inhomogeneous ( frictional ) ratchet . however , even in the absence of any external load the particle keeps moving against the frictional resistance . leaving out the symmetric diffusive part of the motion the particle s unidirectional ( ratchet ) current @xmath15",
    "is maintained against the average frictional force .",
    "the ratio of this work ( the ratchet performs against the frictional drag ) to the total energy pumped into the system from the source of the external forcings is termed as _ stokes efficiency _ , @xmath30 , of the ratchet .",
    "an expression for @xmath30 has been derived earlier@xcite which involves @xmath15 as well as the second moment of the velocity @xmath31 calculated from the probability distribution @xmath32 of the velocity @xmath33 recorded all through the trajectory of the particle .",
    "we have calculated @xmath30 as a function of the amplitude of the applied forcing .",
    "@xmath30 shows a peak , the position of which , however , does not coincide with the peak of the ratchet current .",
    "the distribution @xmath32 is almost symmetric about @xmath34 and the velocity dispersion grows monotonically approaching to be linear in @xmath0 at large @xmath0 .",
    "recently , it has been reported@xcite that in a tilted periodic potential an underdamped particle motion shows dispersionless behaviour in the intermediate time regime for a range of tilt values . in the present work",
    "we show that when the system is driven by a square - wave forcing of appropriate amplitude such dispersionless transient behaviour with added richness can be observed .",
    "the dispersionless behaviour of constant tilt gets punctuated and oscillatory behaviour of dispersion of different kinds , depending on the frequency of the periodic drive , naturally emerges .",
    "interestingly , however , contrary to expectations , dispersionless particle motion do not contribute to ( instead hinders ) ratchet current in this system .    in section",
    "ii the basic equation of motion used in this model calculation will be presented .",
    "the section iii will be devoted to the presentation of the detailed results of our numerical calculation . in the last section ( sec .",
    "iv ) we shall conclude with a discussion .",
    "this part ( ii ) of the work is an extension of our earlier work ( part i ) , where the system was driven adiabatically@xcite to obtain ratchet current . in the present case",
    "we drive the system periodically by a symmetric square - wave forcing and calculate the particle trajectories @xmath35 .",
    "the choice of square - wave forcing , instead of a sinusoidal forcing , is to make a direct contact with the adiabatically driven case .",
    "we thus have the forcing @xmath17 as , + @xmath36 + where @xmath37 is the period of forcing and @xmath38 .",
    "in what follows we shall refer to trajectories @xmath35 computed using the upper signs as the odd numbered trajectories and those calculated with the lower signs as the even numbered trajectories .",
    "the motion of a particle of mass @xmath39 moving in a periodic potential @xmath40 in a medium with friction coefficient @xmath41 with @xmath42 and subjected to a square - wave forcing @xmath17 is described by the langevin equation@xcite , @xmath43 here @xmath10 is the temperature in units of the boltzmann constant @xmath44 .",
    "the gaussian distributed fluctuating forces @xmath45 satisfy the statistics : @xmath46 , and @xmath47 . for convenience ,",
    "we write down eq.(2.1 ) in dimensionless units by setting @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 so that @xmath51 corresponds to an energy equivalent equal to the potential barrier height at @xmath52 .",
    "the reduced langevin equation , with reduced variables denoted again by the same symbols , is written now as @xmath53 where @xmath54 .",
    "thus the periodicity of the potential @xmath55 and also the friction coefficient @xmath56 is @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the potential barrier between any two consecutive wells of @xmath55 persists for all @xmath58 and it just disappears at the critical field value @xmath59 .",
    "the noise variable , in the same symbol @xmath60 , satisfies exactly similar statistics as earlier .",
    "( 2.2 ) is solved numerically ( with given initial conditions ) to obtain the trajectory @xmath35 of the particle for various values of the parameters @xmath61 , and @xmath10 .",
    "also , the steady state mean velocity @xmath15 of the particle is obtained as @xmath62 where the average @xmath63 is evaluated over many trajectories .",
    "the mean velocity is also calculated from the distribution @xmath32 of velocities giving almost identical result .",
    "the langevin equation ( 2.2 ) is solved numerically using two methods : 4@xmath64-order runge - kutta@xcite and heun s method ( for solving ordinary differential equations ) .",
    "we take a time step interval of 0.001 during which the fluctuating force @xmath45 , obtained from a gaussian distributed random number appropriate to the temperature @xmath10 , is considered as constant and the equation solved as an initial value problem . in the next interval",
    "another random number is called to use as the value of @xmath60 and the process repeated . by a careful observation of the individual trajectories of the particle shows that by @xmath65 the particle completely loses its memory of the initial condition it had started with . when we look for steady state solutions the trajectory is generally allowed to run for a time @xmath66 . therefore , for steady state evaluation for @xmath15 , etc .",
    "the results become independent of initial conditions .",
    "the ( runge - kutta ) method had earlier been used and obtained correct results@xcite in a similar situation . also , the method was checked against results obtained earlier for the adiabatic case ( using matrix continued fraction method ) and found to compare well qualitatively@xcite .",
    "heun s method when applied in similar situations take much less time than the runge - kutta method and yields qualitatively as good result ( fig.1 ) . with this confidence in our numerical procedures , we apply either one or the other of these two numerical schemes as the situation demands .",
    "we take @xmath67 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 all through our calculation in the following .",
    "the motion of the particle is governed by the applied square - wave forcing @xmath17 .",
    "as @xmath17 changes periodically so does the position of the particle . in view of this effect",
    "we start our simulation at @xmath68 with @xmath69 , and @xmath70 for alternate trajectories ( to be referred to respectively as odd numbered and even numbered ones , as mentioned earlier ) .",
    "this gives a nice nonoscillating variation of the overall average position when averaged over an large even number of trajectories .",
    "however , while calculating the position dispersions or velocity dispersions at a given time @xmath1 , the even and odd trajectories are treated separately to calculate the deviations from their respective mean values .      in fig.1 , @xmath71 are plotted for two values of phase lag @xmath72 , and 0.4 for the same values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 to illustrate the effect of @xmath5 for @xmath73 .",
    "the ratchet current @xmath15 also shows nonmonotonic behaviour as a function of the period of the drive . in the inset ( fig .",
    "1 ) we plot the varation of @xmath15 as a function of the time period of the drive for @xmath74 . for these parameter values the current @xmath15 peaks at period @xmath75 . for comparison of time scales",
    ", it may be noted that for an equivalent rcsj model of josephson junctions the characteristic josephson plasma frequency @xmath76 turns out to be about @xmath77 times larger than the drive frequency corresponding to @xmath78 , where @xmath79 .",
    "( the sign of @xmath0 is changed after every time interval @xmath80 . ) in this sense we obtain appreciable ratchet current only for very slow drives .",
    "it should , however , be noted that in the infinitely slow adiabatic case the ratchet current is effectively zero for @xmath81 for @xmath19 at @xmath20 . in the following we shall present the results obtained using @xmath82 except when mentioned otherwise explicitly .",
    "the position dispersions @xmath83 , where @xmath84 are evaluated over a large number of trajectories for various values of @xmath0 , and @xmath78 .",
    "it is found that the dispersions fit nicely to @xmath85=\\log(t)+\\log(2d),\\ ] ] for large @xmath1 , typically @xmath86 ( fig .",
    "6 of @xcite ) .    from the linear fit of the graphs we calculate the diffusion constants @xmath87 and the result is shown in fig.2 .",
    "the diffusion constant has a large value between @xmath88 and 0.35 .",
    "the peak height is quite large @xmath89 . as @xmath0",
    "is increased @xmath2 decreases sharply and becomes smaller than 50 ( which is less than 10% of its peak value ) for @xmath90 .",
    "this @xmath91 $ ] is also the region where the ratchet current @xmath15 is appreciable .",
    "the pclet number , @xmath26 , as defined earlier , are also calculated as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "they are plotted in the inset of fig.2 .",
    "it is clear from the figure that in the same region , @xmath26 is also much larger than 2 .",
    "this indicates that in the region @xmath91 $ ] the particle motion is highly diffusive but concomitantly it is greatly coherent too .",
    "this is also indicated by the observation that even though the position dispersions ( fluctuations ) are large the relative fluctuations of position in this region are considerably low ( @xmath92 ) . as indicated by the result in the adiabatic case ( fig .",
    "3 @xcite ) this range of @xmath0 of coherent motion is expected to shift as the value of @xmath9 is changed .    though our system is different from that of machura , et .",
    "@xcite , at this point it would be interesting to make a comparison with their result .",
    "they observe that for their low temperature case @xmath93 in the vicinity of @xmath94 the velocity fluctuation underwent a rapid change ( fig.1a of @xcite ) . to translate this to our case@xcite @xmath94",
    "is equivalent to @xmath95 and given their potential barrier being just about half of the value in our case one should expect the peaking of velocity dispersion to occur below @xmath96 .",
    "taking into consideration of our temperature ( @xmath20 ) being 40 times 0.01 the phenomena should occur much below @xmath96 . in this sense",
    "the region @xmath91 $ ] seems quite reasonable . also , @xmath15 of fig.3a of ref .",
    "@xcite at @xmath97 make a good comparison with fig.1 in our case .",
    "however , as mentioned earlier the two systems are quite different in basics to have an exact comparison .",
    "the velocity distribution @xmath32 also shows interesting behaviour . in fig.3 , we plot @xmath32 for three values of @xmath0 .",
    "a sharp peak which is almost indistinguishable from a gaussian centred at @xmath34 for small @xmath98 gets split up into three peaks for @xmath99 , and similarly for @xmath100 , with the central peak , gradually diminishing .",
    "this shows a behaviour , including the nearly linear growth of the variance with @xmath0 ( inset , fig.3 ) , quite similar to what has been reported earlier in a different system@xcite .",
    "there is , however , one difference .",
    "the side peaks of @xmath32 in our calculation have origin in the running states of the particle .",
    "it is , perhaps , due to the square - wave drive , instead of sinusoidal drive , that for as low amplitude as @xmath101 we get three disjoint velocity bands and at @xmath102 we get just two bands , the central band being almost unpopulated . the three peaks , for example for @xmath101 , could be fitted to a combination of three guassians . with a cursory look ,",
    "the left and right gaussians barely show much difference .",
    "however , @xmath103 gives approximately the same value as @xmath15 , and @xmath104 showing exactly the same nature as @xmath71 ( fig.4 ) .",
    "from the velocity distribution @xmath32 we calculate the stokes efficiency , @xmath30 , defined as@xcite , @xmath105 as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "fig.5 shows that @xmath30 is larger in the same range of @xmath0 where it shows larger @xmath15 .",
    "the peak of @xmath30 , however , does not occur at the same position as the peak of @xmath15 .",
    "it is , however , to be noted that the plotted figure is calculated from averages over a small number ( @xmath106 ) of ensembles because it is computationally quite expensive to obtain results for the steady state ( maximum @xmath107 ) and hence not feasible to obtain averaging over a larger number of ensembles . though the qualitative behaviour is encouraging the efficiencies are small @xmath108 . in the adiabatic drive case ( part i , ref.@xcite ) we have found that stokes efficiency depends on various parameter values : @xmath9 , @xmath10 , etc .",
    "the efficiency shown here is for a small @xmath19 , @xmath109 , and @xmath20 where the current is also very low .",
    "the efficiency of this symmetrically driven system can , however , be improved to a good extent by an optimal choice of these parameters .    an inertial ratchet driven by a zero mean asymmetric drive can , however , give a highly efficient performance compared to the symmetrically driven ratchet .",
    "for example , when the system is driven by a field @xmath110 + with @xmath111 gives an efficiency of @xmath112 compared to @xmath113 in the symmetric - drive ( @xmath114 ) case with @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "this is made possible because in the symmetric drive case the particles move on either direction with almost equal probability whereas in the asymmetric drive case the particle motion in one direction is practically blocked , as is evident from the corresponding velocity distributions shown in the inset of fig.5 .",
    "the contribution of the system inhomogeneity for this improved performance is , however , quite insignificant .      when a constant force @xmath117 is applied to the system it shows dispersionless behaviour : @xmath83 does not change with time in the intermediate time scales , roughly [ @xmath118 , for around [ @xmath119 at @xmath20 for @xmath19 .",
    "the result of dispersionless behaviour had originally been shown and explained@xcite beautifully for constant friction @xmath56 case : the position distribution moves undistorted at constant velocity @xmath120 or equivalently , velocity distribution remains undistorted centerd at @xmath120 . the interval [ @xmath121 of time @xmath1 during which the system shows this remarkable intermediate - time behaviour depends on the tilt force @xmath117 , as should also on other parameters .",
    "@xmath122 is roughly of the order of but much larger than the kramers passage time corresponding to the lower of the potential barriers on either side of a well .",
    "the transient - time dispersionless particle - motion behaviour is sensitive to initial conditions . in the following we specifically begin from the bottom of the well at @xmath123 with particle velocities appropriate to the boltzmann distribution at temperature @xmath20 .    when the inhomogeneous system is driven periodically by a sqaure - wave forcing of amplitude @xmath0 , the dispersionless coherent nature of average motion",
    "gets interrupted depending on the period @xmath124 of the forcing [ fig.6 ] .",
    "when @xmath125 , at @xmath126 the dispersion gets a jerk and shoots up only to get flattened again to an another bout of dispersionless regime .",
    "this regime too gets a similar jolt after another @xmath80 and the process continues for a large number of periods .",
    "when the direction of the applied force is changed the forward moving particles are forced to halt momentarily to begin moving in the new direction of the force afresh .",
    "while in the state of halt particles are more likely to find themselves closer to the bottom of some well and thus the system gets initialised as in the beginning .",
    "the system finds itself in similar situation again and again periodically with each change of force direction and continues with its unfinished dispersionless sojourn for a large number of periods with remarkable robustness [ inset of fig.6 ] .",
    "however , when @xmath127 the system never gets a chance to experience its dispersionless journey because only a fraction of the particles get the opportunity to acquire the required constant average velocity@xcite of @xmath128 and the rest keep lagging behind even by the end of constant force duration @xmath80 . instead , as soon as the direction of the force @xmath117 is reversed , after @xmath80 the dispersion dips after a brief climb up , as the particles get herded together briefly before getting dispersed further in the reversed direction of @xmath0 .",
    "this can be seen very clearly in the time evolution of the position probability distribution profile @xmath129 .",
    "the front of the @xmath129 moves with velocity @xmath128 while the rest lag behind it moving at a slower speed but trying to catch up with the front throughout @xmath80 .",
    "this process of dispersion dipping ( after a small contunuing rise ) and rising to a higher value after each @xmath80 is repeated for several tens of periods [ fig.6 ] .",
    "the intermediate - time dispersionless motion is not an exclusive characteristic feature of inhomogeneous systems .",
    "it is a characteristic feature of inertial washboard potential system@xcite .",
    "however , its study in the inertial inhomogeneous system provides a convincing explanation of the variation of ratchet current as a function of @xmath80 [ inset of fig.1 ] and helps in finding a criterion to improve the performance of the ratchet .    in fig.7 the average displacement of particles as a function of time when driven by equal number of @xmath130 profiles",
    "is presented for @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "this case corresponds to the repeated dispersionless motion shown in fig.6 .",
    "fig.7 clearly shows that during the dispersionless motion the average dispacement of particles effectively remains constant . in other words , during the period of dispersionless motion the particles move equally in the left as well as in the right direction thereby contributing nothing to the ratchet current : while in the dispersionless motion the particles fail to see the frictional inhomogeneity of the system .",
    "all the change in the average displacement and hence all the contribution to the ratchet current comes during the dispersive period of motion .",
    "this is shown in the inset of fig.7 where for clarity the mean particle positions for @xmath17 beginning with @xmath133 ( even numbered trajectories ) are shown as a function of time with their sign reversed .",
    "the mean particle displacements for odd and even numbered trajectories differ only during the interval just after the reversal of @xmath0 and before the dispersionless regime begins and the two lines of mean positions ( insets of fig.7 ) run parallel during the dispersionless regime .",
    "this clearly indicates that in order to get a larger current an optimum choice of @xmath80 needs to be made which , naturally , avoids the dispersionless regime but is not too small in order to allow the particles to leave their potential wells . this conclusion is well supported by the inset of fig.1 .",
    "the velocity dispersions and position dispersions together show interesting behaviour .",
    "fig.8 shows that during the dispersionless regime when the position dispersion is constant and maximum the velocity dispersion is also constant but it has a minimum value .",
    "this minimum constant value is repeated in all the @xmath134 intervals whereas the value of the constant position dispersion increases in every successive @xmath135 interval as shown in fig.6 . in the dispersive regimes",
    "the velocity dispersions are squeezed to very sharp troughs exactly where the position dispersions show sharp peaking . in the inset of fig.8",
    "these dispersions are shown for @xmath136 .",
    "the onward rush of the particles do not halt immediately after the direction of @xmath0 is changed at @xmath135 but it continues for a very short time giving a small increase in the spread of @xmath137 .",
    "then a majority of particles stop , giving a sharp peak in the @xmath32 at @xmath34 reducing its spread drastically . at that moment the product of position and velocity distribution spread becomes a minimum .",
    "the reverse journey thereafter increases the spread of @xmath32 but there is a slow squeezing of @xmath137 before it begins to spread again .",
    "the maximum @xmath137 squeezing , however , does not exactly coincide with the largest of the broad @xmath32 but it is at a rather closer range . in this case",
    "too the minimum velocity dispersion remains constant for all @xmath135 .",
    "but the wings of @xmath137 , though thin , keep spreading with time giving an average increase of dispersion as time increases .",
    "however , most of the particles remain confined roughly to a region [ @xmath138 for a long time .",
    "the ratchet effect , in this work , is brought about just by the phase lag @xmath5 between the potential and the friction of the medium , without having to have an external bias .",
    "this is seemingly a weak cause to generate unidirectional current .",
    "the figs.1 through 5 refer to a square - wave forcing with @xmath78 .",
    "the choice of this @xmath80 clearly avoids the dispersionless regime . yet , this is not the optimum value of @xmath80 .",
    "it should have been around 500 in order to get the largest possible ratchet current .",
    "this choice would have definitely enhanced the efficiency of operation .",
    "the same can also be said about other parameters , such as @xmath10 , and @xmath5 for @xmath19 .",
    "however , with the help of these figures we have been able to exhibit the qualitative trends shown by the ratchet .    in the inset of fig.6",
    "we have drawn a straight line with slope 1 as a guide to show that ultimately the curves should achieve that average slope at large times for various @xmath80 values of drives . even though the average slope of the curves have not yet reached the diffusive slope of one the small @xmath80 curves are slowly approaching that value .",
    "one can , therefore , safely infer that in the steady state situation the effective diffusion constant should increase monotonically with @xmath80 for small @xmath80 .",
    "the frequency of drive or equivalently @xmath80 , thus , plays important role about how the particles diffuse out of their wells .",
    "for example , the population of the initial well depletes with time exponentially , @xmath139 , with @xmath140 for @xmath136 and @xmath141 for @xmath142 , for @xmath19 at @xmath20 that we have studied . by the time the well gets effectively exhausted the first particles would have moved farther than a thousand of potential wells .",
    "of course , this first well itself ( as all others ) keeps getting repopulated all the time .",
    "the dispersive behaviour for drives with @xmath143 is difficult to study because it takes a very large computer time to arrive at a concrete result .",
    "however , the indications are there that for these large @xmath80 also , the system will show repeated dispersionless regimes , though somewhat enfeebled because the process of diffusion will dominate at these large times .    to conclude , the study suggests an interesting method of obtaining ratchet current in inertial noisy systems by exploiting the frictional inhomogeneity of the medium .",
    "it also exhibits clearly that the ratchet current , in this system , is contributed by dispersive conditions and not by coherent movements of particles .",

    "<S> the underdamped langevin equation of motion of a particle , in a symmetric periodic potential and subjected to a symmetric periodic forcing with mean zero over a period , with nonuniform friction , is solved numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the particle is shown to acquire a steady state mean velocity at asymptotically large time scales . </S>",
    "<S> this net particle velocity or the ratchet current is obtained in a range of forcing amplitudes @xmath0 and peaks at some value of @xmath0 within the range depending on the value of the average friction coefficient and temperature of the medium . at these large time scales </S>",
    "<S> the position dispersion grows proportionally with time , @xmath1 , allowing for calculating the steady state diffusion coefficient @xmath2 which , interestingly , shows a peaking behaviour around the same @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratchet current , however , turns out to be largely coherent . at intermediate time scales , which bridge the small time scale behaviour of dispersion@xmath3 to the large time </S>",
