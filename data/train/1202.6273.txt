    "next , let @xmath1 and @xmath3 be the ones in ( [ eq : schiffer ] ) and suppose there exists a diffeomorphism @xmath24 further , we let @xmath25 then , according to theorem  [ thm : transoptics ] , if one lets @xmath26 , we have @xmath27 hence , it is natural to propose the following generalized schiffer s conjecture :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ let @xmath28 be uniformly elliptic and symmetric . does the existence of a nontrivial solution to @xmath29 imply that there must exist a diffeomorphism @xmath23 such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    [ def:1 ] let @xmath28 be uniformly elliptic .",
    "then , it is said to possess the pompeiu property if the corresponding over - determined system ( [ eq : general schiffer 2 ] ) has only the trivial solution .    later in section 3",
    ", we shall see that the pompeiu property of the parameters @xmath32 would have important implications for invisibility cloaking in acoustics .",
    "let @xmath33 and @xmath34 be uniformly elliptic and symmetric such that @xmath35 consider the following interior transmission problem for a pair @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 . if there exists a nontrivial pair of solutions @xmath36 to ( [ eq : te ] ) , then @xmath39 is called a generalized interior transmission eigenvalue , and @xmath36 are called generalized interior transmission eigenfunctions .",
    "the interior transmission eigenvalue problem arises in inverse scattering theory and has a long history in literature ( cf .",
    "it was first introduced in @xcite in connection with an inverse scattering problem for the reduced wave equation .",
    "later , it found important applications in inverse scattering theory , especially , for the study of qualitative reconstruction schemes including linear sampling method and factorization method ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the one ( [ eq : te ] ) presented here is a generalized formulation of the interior transmission eigenvalue problem that has been considered in the literature .",
    "in recent years , transformation optics and invisibility cloaking have received significant attentions ; see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein .",
    "the crucial ingredient is the transformation invariance of the acoustic wave equations , which is actually theorem  [ thm : transoptics ] .",
    "let s consider the well - known two - dimensional cloaking problem for the time - harmonic acoustic wave governed by the helmholtz equation ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the wave frequency , @xmath16 is symmetric matrix - valued denoting the acoustical density and @xmath42 is the bulk modulus . in ( [ eq : helm1 ] ) ,",
    "the parameters are given as @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "in the physical situation , @xmath45 is the cloaking medium which we shall specify later , and @xmath46 is the target object including a passive medium @xmath47 and an active source or sink @xmath48 . the invisibility is understood in terms of the exterior measurement encoded either into the boundary dirichlet - to - neumann ( dtn ) map or the scattering amplitude far - away from the object . to ease our exposition",
    ", we only consider the boundary dtn map .",
    "let @xmath49 and define the dtn operator by @xmath50 we also let @xmath51 denote the  free \" dtn operator on @xmath52 , namely the dtn map associated with the helmholtz equation ( [ eq : helm1 ] ) with @xmath53 and @xmath54 in @xmath55 .",
    "next , we shall construct @xmath45 to make @xmath56 to that end , we let @xmath57 it is verified that @xmath23 maps @xmath58 to @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the projection to the radial direction , defined by @xmath63 i.e. , @xmath64 is represented by the symmetric matrix @xmath65 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath66 possesses both degenerate and blow - up singularities at the cloaking interface @xmath67 .",
    "hence , one need to deal with the singular helmholtz equation ( [ eq : helm1])([eq : bc ] ) .",
    "it is natural to consider physically meaningful solutions with finite energy . to that end",
    ", one could introduce the weighted sobolev norm ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath68 it is directly verified that for @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the linear space of smooth functions in @xmath55 , and the standard polar coordinate @xmath72 in @xmath5 has been utilized .",
    "hence , we set @xmath73 and @xmath74 which are closed subspaces of @xmath71 .",
    "then , we introduce the finite energy solution space @xmath75 that is , the closure of the linear function space @xmath76 with respect to the singularly weighted sobolev norm @xmath77 .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) is justified in @xcite by solving ( [ eq : helm1])([eq : bc ] ) in @xmath78 .",
    "particularly , it is shown that @xmath79 is a solution to @xmath80 in order to show the solvability of ( [ eq : interior ] ) by using fredholm theory , it is necessary to consider the following eigenvalue problem @xmath81 we let @xmath82 denote the set of solutions to ( [ eq : interior eigenvalue ] ) .",
    "clearly , ( [ eq : interior ] ) is uniquely solvable iff @xmath83 .",
    "if ( [ eq : interior eigenvalue ] ) possess nontrivial solutions , then one can not cloak a source @xmath84 since in such a case , ( [ eq : interior ] ) has no finitely energy solution , and such a radiating source would break the cloaking .",
    "next , we note the close connection between the ( [ eq : interior eigenvalue ] ) and the generalized schiffer s conjecture ( [ eq : general schiffer 2 ] ) . according to definition  [ def:1 ]",
    ", it is readily seen that if the target medium parameters @xmath85 fails to have the pompeiu property , then ( [ eq : interior eigenvalue ] ) has nontrivial solutions .",
    "that is , one would encounter the interior resonance problem for the invisibility cloaking discussed above .",
    "but we would also like to note that the system ( [ eq : interior eigenvalue ] ) arising from invisibility cloaking is still formally determined , whereas ( [ eq : general schiffer 2 ] ) of the generalized schiffer s conjecture is over - determined .",
    "the connection discussed above between the singular cloaking problem and schiffer s conjecture is natural when one is curious in whether and how such spherical cloaking design is generalized to other shaped cloaked domain .    in order to avoid the singular structure of the perfect cloaking ,",
    "it is natural to incorporate regularization into the context and consider the corresponding approximate cloaking .",
    "let @xmath86 which maps @xmath87 and let @xmath88 now , we consider the nonsingular cloaking problem ( [ eq : helm1])([eq : bc ] ) with @xmath45 given in ( [ eq : nonsingular ] ) .",
    "let @xmath89 denote the corresponding solution in this case .",
    "the limiting behavior of @xmath89 as @xmath90 was considered in @xcite . in order to justify the near - cloak of the regularized construction , the following eigenvalue problem arose from the corresponding study , @xmath91 it is shown in @xcite that if ( [ eq : int2 ] ) has only trivial solution , then @xmath92 converges to the  free - space \" solution , whereas @xmath93 converges to @xmath1 implied in @xmath94 otherwise , if ( [ eq : int2 ] ) has nontrivial solutions forming the set @xmath95 , then it is shown that if @xmath96 , then the cloaking fails as @xmath90 .",
    "now , let s take a more careful look at the eigenvalue problem ( [ eq : int2 ] ) . by letting @xmath97 and using the conformal mapping @xmath98",
    ", we set @xmath99 with @xmath100 .",
    "one can verify directly that @xmath101 and @xmath102 satisfy the following generalized interior transmission eigenvalue problem @xmath103    from our earlier discussions in this section , one can see that the invisibility cloaking construction is very unstable , especially when there is interior resonance problem .",
    "hence , in order to overcome this instability , cloaking schemes by incorporating some damping mechanism through the adding of a lossy layer between the cloaked and cloaking regions have been introduced and studied recently , see @xcite .",
    "but it is interesting to further note that for cloaking design with a lossy layer , one may encounter eigenvalues in the complex plan , i.e. , poles .",
    "in fact , it is numerically observed in @xcite for the cloaking of electromagnetic waves , the cloak effect will be deteriorated when the frequency is close to the poles .",
    "the work is supported by nsf grant , dms 1207784 .",
    "the author would like to thank the anonymous referee for many insightful and constructive comments ."
