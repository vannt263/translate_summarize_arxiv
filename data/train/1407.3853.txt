    "in contrast , simple considerations of susy naturalness anticipate a susy breaking scale around the weak scale typified by @xmath24 gev .",
    "thus , the higgs mass and sparticle mass limits combine to sharpen the `` little hierarchy''@xcite typified by @xmath25 .",
    "the growing little hierarchy has prompted several authors to question whether the mssm is overly fine - tuned , and either flatly wrong@xcite or at least in need of additional features which sacrifice parsimony / minimality@xcite . before rushing to such drastic conclusions , it is prudent to ascertain if all susy spectra are fine - tuned or if some spectra are indeed natural .      to proceed",
    "further one must adopt at least one of several quantitative naturalness measures which are available .",
    "we label these as    * the electroweak measure @xmath26@xcite , * the higgs mass fine - tuning measure @xmath27@xcite and * the traditional eenz / bg measure @xmath28@xcite .",

    "the @xmath26 measure asks for the largest contribution on the right - hand - side to be comparable to @xmath36 so that no unnatural fine - tunings are required to generate @xmath37 gev .",
    "the main requirement is then that @xmath38 and also that @xmath31 is driven radiatively to small , and not large , negative values@xcite .",
    "also , the top squark contributions @xmath39 are minimized for tev - scale highly mixed top squarks , which also lift the higgs mass to @xmath40 gev@xcite .      the higgs mass fine - tuning measure",
    "@xmath27 asks that the radiative correction @xmath41 to the higgs mass m_h^2 ^ 2+m_h_u^2()+m_h_u^2 [ eq : mhs ] be comparable to @xmath42 .",
    "this contribution is usually written as @xmath43 which is used to claim that third generation squarks @xmath44 be approximately less than 500 gev and @xmath18 be small for natural susy .",
    "however , several approximations are necessary to derive this result , the worst of which is to neglect that the value of @xmath31 itself contributes to @xmath41 . by combining dependent contributions ,",
    "then instead one requires that the two terms on the rhs of m_h^2 = ^2 + ( m_h_u^2 ( ) + m_h_u^2 ) [ eq : mh2 ] be comparable to @xmath42 .",
    "however in contrast to the sm for the susy case , ew symmetry is not even broken at tree level in models where the soft terms arise from hidden sector susy breaking .",

    "<S> recently , it has been argued that various measures of susy naturalness electroweak , higgs mass and eenz / bg when applied consistently concur with one another and make very specific predictions for natural supersymmetric spectra . </S>",

    "<S> we apply the unified naturalness measure to the case of heavy higgs bosons @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that their masses are bounded from above by naturalness depending on @xmath4 : _ e.g. _ for 10% fine - tuning and @xmath5 , we expect @xmath6 tev whilst for 3% fine - tuning and @xmath4 as high as 50 , then @xmath7 tev . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the presence of light higgsinos seriously alters the heavy higgs boson branching ratios , thus diminishing prospects for usual searches into standard model ( sm ) final states , while new discovery possibilities arise due to the supersymmetric decay modes . </S>",
    "<S> the heavy susy decay modes tend to be @xmath8 so that single heavy higgs production is characterized by the presence of high @xmath9 @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 bosons plus missing @xmath13 . </S>",
