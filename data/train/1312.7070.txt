    "at the low colloid concentration it is possible to use the linear approximation ( see e.g @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider one colloid in the flow field",
    ". at the large distances compare to the colloid size @xmath7 the liquid flow can be considered as uniform .",
    "the equations of the motion have the form of the standard equations for an incompressible viscous liquid .",
    "we assume that the colloid is incompressible also . at the colloid boundary the liquid velocities and that of the colloid surface are equal and the tensor of the momentum transfer is continuous .    the macroscopic motion connected with the large scale @xmath3 is a kind of an external force acting on the separate colloid and we can use the well known result ( see e.g. @xcite ) for the calculation of the force acting on the body ( colloid ) immersed in the liquid .",
    "if the body is moved with the liquid this force is equal to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the density of the liquid , @xmath10 is the volume of the colloid .",
    "but really one must take into account the relative motion and add @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the tensor of the associated masses .",
    "the relative motion gives also stokes friction force @xmath13 .",
    "summing the various contributions one get the force acting on the colloid @xmath14 using stokes law suggests that the time of the `` viscous '' relaxation @xmath15 is small compare to the `` hydrodynamical '' time @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the velocity of the macroscopic body relative to the liquid .",
    "stokes force is proportional to the first power of the colloid size and therefore the terms with the accelerations are comparatively small .",
    "therefore the zero approximation gives @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the local fluid velocity at a small distance @xmath7 from the colloid .",
    "the next approximation can be obtained by introducing the zero approximation in that gives @xmath20    we shall use this approximation for the relative velocity of the colloid .",
    "this local `` microscopic '' motion gives the contribution to the averaged equations of motion on the distances of the order @xmath4 . on the contrary",
    "neglecting this contribution the colloids have no effect on the averaged equations of motion .    in stokes",
    "approximation the force acting on unit area of the spherical colloids surface is constant @xmath21 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the collid deformations are absent . in order to find the deformations one needs to consider oseens corrections connected with the nonlinear inertial terms .",
    "the procedure to find the corrections in reynolds number @xmath22 made in @xcite can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to investigate the solution of the equation @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath25 is the relative velocity equal to its constant value far from the coil . in the external flow field",
    "there are two domains : the near one at @xmath26 and the far at @xmath27 , overlapping at @xmath28 . in the near domain the starting approximation coincides with stokes solution , in the far domain",
    "the starting is oseen approximation @xmath29 .",
    "the sewing of the appropriate solutions in the overlapping region gives the corrections to stokes solution @xmath30 @xmath31 here the spherical coordinates with the polar ax along the relative velocity are used and the non dimensional quantities are introduced:@xmath32 in the units of the colloid radius @xmath7 and the velocities in the units of the relative velocity @xmath33 .",
    "the calculations are simplified at small velocities and give at the colloid surface the pressure @xmath34 and the tangential strain @xmath35    at the picture ( 1 ) it is shown some section of the colloid and the points on its surface with the maximal stresses and their directions .",
    "there is the compression along the relative velocity direction and the elongation along the meridians with zeros at the poles and the equator .",
    "these stresses produce the deformation of the colloid but the calculation require a definite model for the connection of deformations and stresses inside the colloid .",
    "there is the general statement belonging to maxwell that the rapid ( short time ) stresses correspond to the elasticity theory but the slow ( long time ) stresses correspond to the viscous liquid . for the case of colloid solutions at high reynolds numbers the colloids have the velocity close to the velocity of the solvent that gives the short time action on the separate colloid in the domain with the large acceleration and most probable is the validity of the elasticity theory .",
    "as a result the colloid is compressed in moving direction and is elongated in the perpendicular directions . that gives the increased colloid cross section and it moves in the direction with the largest drag .",
    "therefore the motion instability is possible .",
    "however this question has not direct relation to the drug reduction at the flow around a macroscopic body .",
    "the averaged hydrodynamical equations for the incompressible liquid with the solution of weakly compressible colloids at the small concentration contain the equation @xmath36 and the conservation law of the colloid number @xmath37      the last equation is the conservation law of the total momentum for the system of the liquid and colloids @xmath40 =      -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_k }      \\left [          \\pi_{ik}+ cm(w_i^p - v_i^l)v_k^l      \\right]\\ ] ]      we consider first the absence of the colloids .",
    "the general picture of the liquid flow around an immobile macroscopic body is well investigated . for large reynolds number @xmath44 at the far domain on the distances",
    "large compare to the boundary layer thickness the flow is vortex free . at the boundary layer approximate external surface",
    "the normal to the body velocity is almost zero .",
    "the boundary layer begins in the forward critical point with a finite thickness .",
    "moving in the flow direction one get the slow increase of the tangent velocity and the boundary layer thickness till the maximum of the tangent velocity is achieved . after that the tangent velocity is lowering and the laminar layer become unstable .",
    "its thickness has a sharp increase with a sharp decrease of the tangent velocity in the same region .",
    "this phenomenon is known as `` the tearing off '' the boundary layer from the body surface and the creation of the turbulent `` stagnation '' domain for the flow adjoining to the second critical point as it is shown on fig.2 .",
    "if one has the colloid solution in the liquid then the large laminar part of the boundary layer has a small liquid acceleration and the colloid velocity is quite close to the liquid velocity .",
    "therefore they do not affect on the average flow according to .",
    "however in the region where the boundary layer is `` tearing off '' one has the large acceleration ( `` braking '' ) at large reynolds number . that gives the strong colloid stream in the initial flow direction",
    "if the colloid density is larger then that of the liquid according to .",
    "the drag at large reynolds numbers in the colloid absence is given ( @xcite ) by formula @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the body cross section , @xmath17 is the body velocity relative to the liquid , @xmath47 is a constant depending on reynolds number only . from the experiment",
    "it is known that at the large reynolds number @xmath48 the function @xmath47 essentially changes its form giving a sharp drag reduction at comparatively small increase of reynolds number @xmath49 known as `` a drag crisis '' .",
    "this phenomenon is defined as the moving the `` tearing off '' domain down the flow and the strong decrease of the `` effective '' body cross section .",
    "this expression gives the estimate of the colloid contribution to reynolds number .",
    "if this quantity is equal to the experimental @xmath54 then one get the drug reduction like the drug crisis without the polymer solution .",
    "the condition of the drug reduction by the polymer solution define the coil concentration and the sign of the difference @xmath55 .",
    "this condition can be rewritten in the form        the details of the turbulent flows in a long pipes at large reynolds numbers are not so well investigated .",
    "partially phenomenological karman - prandtl theory is based ( as was shown by l.d.landau ) on the dimensional analysis and the experimental determination of some empirical constants .",
    "the main statement @xcite is the existence of the central area in the pipe cross section with a weak dependence of the mean velocity on the radius ( fig.3 the shaded area ) and the viscous sublayer close to the wall of the tube with the linear decrease of the liquid velocity to zero at the wall .",
    "the velocity derivative in the viscous sublayer is large compare to that in the central area .",
    "if the colloids are present the flow in the central domain is weakly affected because the mean colloid velocities are very close to that of the liquid .",
    "however near the transition boundary colloids can achieve an essential velocity according to if @xmath59 .",
    "therefore the central domain with the large mean velocity must increase due to the colloids motion .",
    "the numerical estimate is difficult because one must know the mean value of the acceleration @xmath60 for the turbulent flow in the transition region , and the unknown empirical constants defining the central and side domains .",
