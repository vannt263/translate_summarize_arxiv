    "hydrogen is the dominant component of the baryonic matter in the universe and most of it is in the form of diffuse intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation proves that it became neutral around 400,000 years after the big bang , but the absorption strength by igm neutral hydrogen in quasar spectra [ i.e. , the gunn - peterson ( gp , gunn & peterson 1965 ) test ] tells us that igm in the present universe is highly ionized .",
    "it is widely believed that the cosmic reionization occurred around @xmath610 by radiation emitted from stars of the earliest generations , but the detailed history of reionization and early galaxy formation is yet to be observationally revealed . detecting neutral hydrogen before reionization is an important challenge to understand the first stage of galaxy formation ( see , e.g. , fan et al .",
    "2006 ; barkana & loeb 2007 ; robertson et al .",

    "although igm hydrogen seems largely ionized at @xmath7 5.5 from the quasar gp test , the gp optical depth rapidly increases with redshift around @xmath8 6 indicating a systematic change of the igm nature that may be related to reionization ( fan 2012 ) .",
    "however , completely saturated absorptions ( gp troughs ) give only a weak lower bound on the neutral fraction of igm hydrogen , @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , quasars are strongly biased tracers generally found in the strongest density peaks in large - scale structure , and quasars may have altered the ionization status of surrounding igm by their strong radiation . therefore , there is currently no direct evidence that reionization was complete by @xmath10 56 ( mesinger 2010 ) .",
    "it is thus important to search neutral igm having higher @xmath11 than that probed by the gp test at @xmath6 , and it may be detected by the damping wing feature redward of the resonant ly@xmath1 wavelength .",
    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows are expected to be a unique and useful tool for this approach ( miralda - escude 1998 ; lamb & reichart 2000 ; zhang 2007 ) because of the following reasons .",
    "the intrinsic nonthermal synchrotron spectrum before absorption is a simple power - law , and hence a precise analysis on the damping wing shape is possible .",
    "grbs are expected to be less biased than quasars , allowing to probe more normal regions in large scale structure .",
    "finally , their radiation hardly affects the ionization status of surrounding igm because of much shorter duration than quasars .",
    "however , strong constraints on reionization from grbs have not yet been obtained , because of the low event rate of sufficiently bright grbs at high redshifts , and contamination of hydrogen in their host galaxies to the damping wing feature .",
    "the only grb - based constraint on reionization is a weak upper limit of @xmath12 at @xmath13 ( kawai et al .",
    "2006 ; totani et al . 2006 ) , where the observed red ly@xmath1 damping wing can be explained only by neutral hydrogen in its host galaxy with a column density of @xmath14 .",

    "2013b ) implies that a much better constraint on igm neutral hydrogen may be obtained than the previous cases . here",
    "we present a damping wing analysis of the unprecedentedly high signal - to - noise optical spectrum of grb 130606a taken by the subaru telescope during 10.413.2 hr after the burst , to derive new constraints on the neutral hydrogen fraction of igm at @xmath17 .",

    "we paid a special attention to the data reduction as follows , since the shape of the damping wing may be affected even by small systematic uncertainties in such a high precision test . in this work",
    "we are interested in the narrow wavelength range including the damping wing , and we performed the reduction limited within the range of 83778902  , to avoid unnecessary systematic bias induced by , e.g. , a sensitivity curve fitting in a wider wavelength range .",

    "we define the four wavelength ranges i  iv ( indicated in figs .",

    "the trends of increasing / decreasing residuals with increasing wavelength in the ranges ii / iv seem to be connected to the excess in the range iii , showing the overall systematic trend of concave curvature spanning in the entire analysis wavelength range of 84008900  .",
    "we have examined various sources of systematic uncertainties , but the 0.6% level curvature in this narrow wavelength range can not be explained ( see section [ section : systematics ] ) .    the @xmath24 value of this fit is 87.58 , and statistically the chance probability of getting this value is 2.7% ( i.e. , 2.2@xmath2 rejection ) for the 68 data points and four model parameters ( i.e. , 64 degrees of freedom ) .",

    "this sigma difference is not surprising , because the total @xmath24 value and @xmath24 difference for different models are independent tests .",
    "for example , if a model parameter is wrong in a model fit but the parameter is affecting only a limited number of @xmath24 degrees of freedom , the total @xmath24 value is insensitive and we need to see the @xmath24 difference when the model parameter is changed",
    ".    the concave curvature can be resolved by an absorption component that becomes rapidly stronger at shorter wavelengths , and hence the redward damping wing of another neutral hydrogen component on the sightline is a good candidate to improve the fit .",
    "therefore we test the next simplest model with diffuse igm h extending to the same redshift as the grb host , i.e. , @xmath36 ( the igm-@xmath22 model hereafter ) .",

    "the best - fit is obtained at @xmath37 , and the relative statistical significance against the host - only model can be estimated again in the standard manner ( press et al .",

    "comparing the best - fit @xmath24 values of the host - only and igm-@xmath22 models in table [ table : parameters ] , there is a reduction of @xmath38 with one new parameter of @xmath11 , where all the other parameters are marginalized .",
    "therefore the latter model is preferred at the statistical significance of @xmath39 from @xmath24 statistics with one degree of freedom .",
    "however , the curvature of residuals is still evident for this model in fig .",
    "[ fig : residual ] . this may be further improved by allowing lower values of @xmath40 , because such a model has a weaker wavelength dependence of igm absorption , and hence the effect can reach to longer wavelength beyond the ly@xmath1 break , while keeping the absorption around the break relatively weak .",
    "therefore we performed a fit treating @xmath41 as a further free model parameter ( the igm - low@xmath23 model , hereafter ) , and the dependence of the minimum @xmath24 , best - fit @xmath3 and @xmath5 on @xmath41 is shown in fig .",

    "this result again indicates that the host - only model is disfavored at @xmath50 level . on the other hand ,",

    ", we also show the flux attenuation factor by various components of absorption in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec_model ] .",
    "the key point is that the igm absorption signature ( especially with smaller @xmath40 ) has a weaker wavelength dependence than that by hydrogen in the host , which is essential to resolve the curvature found in the residual spectrum of the host - only fit .",
    "another possibility to improve the host - only fit is a dla rather than diffuse igm .",
    "therefore we test the intervening dla model , in which the dla component at the redshift of the observed metal absorption system ( @xmath51 ) is added to the host - only model , but without including diffuse igm .",

    "[ fig : spec_model ] , [ fig : residual ] , and table [ table : parameters ] .",
    "it is found that this model gives a similarly good fit to the igm - low@xmath23 model , if the h column density is @xmath52 , which is about 10 times larger than @xmath18 in the grb host .",
    "we will further examine whether this intervening dla model is consistent with other spectral features in section [ section : dla ] .",
    "the discrepancy between the host - only model and the observed data is mainly because of the concave curvature of the data compared with the best - fit model curve , extending in the entire wavelength range analyzed ( 8400 - 8900  ) with an amplitude of 0.6% of the continuum flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig : residual ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , the sensitivity curve fit to the standard star is accurate by 0.1% level , and the 0.6% level difference of the spectral shape should be detectable .    to further test possible systematic uncertainties in the relative flux calibration , we constructed another sensitivity curve by using another calspec standard star gd 153 , which is one of the primary standards of the calspec system and was observed by subaru one day before the observation of grb 130606a .",
    "the airmass at the time of taking the vph900 spectrum of grb 130606a is in between those for the two standard stars ( feige 34 and gd 153 ) .",
    "the shapes of the two sensitivity curves are consistent within 0.2% accuracy , indicating that the observed spectral shape is correct at 0.2% level , taking into account the variation of the standard star templates , airmass , and atmospheric / instrumental conditions over the time scale of one day .",
    "the primary standards of the calspec calibration system are the model spectra of the three pure hydrogen white dwarfs including gd 153 ( bohlin 2007 ) , and the model spectra have a smooth power - law profile in 84008900  , showing no complicated absorption structures .",
    "residuals of the hst data from the model spectra indicate that a curvature of 0.6% level in 84008900  is highly unlikely to be a result of the uncertainty about the calspec template ( see fig . 3 of bohlin 2007 ) .    in the wavelength range iii ,",
    "a broad enhancement of the spectral noise is seen , which is a feature by the atmospheric o@xmath53 emission lines .",
    "if the spectrum is systematically biased by this effect , it would have an important effect on our fitting result , because the deviation of the data from the host - only model is the largest in this range . to check this",
    "we examined the fit residuals of the subaru data for the standard star with respect to the sensitivity curve fit , and there is no systematic excess in this region .",
    "the noise level is decreasing to larger wavelength within the range iii , but the fit residuals of the host - only model in fig .",
    "[ fig : residual ] do not show any systematic wavelength dependence in this range .",
    "the concave curvature of the residuals ranging in the wide range of 84008900   can not be resolved only by the o@xmath53 feature in the range iii .",
    "we examined the atmospheric absorptions in 85008900   using the atran database ( http://atran.sofia.usra.edu/ ) , and found that the expected curvature produced by weak atmospheric absorption lines is about 0.1% in this wavelength range .",
    "it should be noted that the effect of atmospheric absorption should have been corrected if the effect is the same for the standard star and the grb afterglow .",
    "although a part of this effect may remain uncorrected by a possible systematic change of atmospheric conditions at the observing times for the star and the afterglow , it is impossible to explain the 0.6% level curvature of the host - only fit residuals .",
    "we also examined the effect of slit / aperture loss of afterglow light .",
    "the slit loss of light changes the relative flux of the spectrum by the atmospheric dispersion effect , but we confirmed that this is less than 0.05% within the wavelength range analyzed .",
    "we found that the image size along the spatial direction changes with wavelength , which is likely due to wavelength dependent seeing and/or chromatic aberration .",
    "therefore we quantitatively examined the systematic change of the spectrum by aperture loss .",
    "( the aperture size for the grb spectra is smaller than that for the standard star . )",
    "we found that this changes the relative flux at 8400 and 8900   by @xmath20 2.6% , but the wavelength dependence is monotonic and well described by a power - law , having an effect of changing @xmath3 by 0.45 .",
    "the analyzed spectrum has been corrected about this before the model fittings , and hence correction for this effect is not necessary for the @xmath3 values presented in this paper .",
    "since this effect is well described by a power - law , it is unlikely to be the origin of the residuals showing a curvature .",
    "we have removed the wavelength regions showing visually discernible absorption features from our analysis , but weaker absorption lines may affect the fit results .",
    "since it is difficult to test the effect of weak lines that can not be recognized , we instead performed the fittings including the four relatively weak absorption features at 8492 , 8505 , 8824 , and 8889  , which were removed in our baseline analysis .",
    "some of these may be statistical fluctuation rather than real lines .",
    "the best - fit @xmath24 values for the host - only and igm-@xmath22 models are now 134.69 and 123.11 for 69 data points , and the preference for the igm model ( @xmath54 ) is not significantly changed .",
    "we also tested possible systematic effects induced by large noise in the regions of atmospheric airglow lines .",
    "we repeated the fittings after removing the narrow airglow regions centered at 8435 , 8455 , 8495 , 8505 , 8542 , 8552 , 8830 , 8840 , 8852 , 8870 , and 8888  .",
    "( these regions can be seen as bumps in the error curve shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath24 values of the two models are 60.17 and 51.73 for 45 data points , and @xmath55 is still significant at 2.9@xmath2 .",
    "we used the central redshift of @xmath56 for the h gas in the grb host , based on the redshifts of the metal absorption lines measured in the same spectrum .",
    "the c line shows a relatively low redshift of @xmath57 , and the uncertainty about the host redshift can be tested by adopting this value for @xmath22 .",
    "we then found the best - fit @xmath24 values of 86.13 and 79.30 for the host - only and igm-@xmath58 models , respectively , and @xmath59 is still significant at 2.6@xmath2 .",
    "we considered only a single power - law for the intrinsic afterglow spectrum before absorption effects , though afterglows sometimes show concave breaks in their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , which may explain the curvature found in the residuals of the host - only fit .",
    "however , if a spectral break is close to the observed wavelength range , we expect from the afterglow theory a significant time evolution of sed by the passage of the break in an observing band ( zhang 2007 ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nir_sed ] , the reported near - infrared colors are fairly constant from 36 min to 35 hr after the burst , and no evidence for spectral breaks other than the ly@xmath1 break is seen .",
    "if the 0.6% curvature in 84008900   is represented by a quadratic term in the @xmath60 versus @xmath61 relation , it would result in a change of @xmath62 by just a 7% change of wavelength @xmath63 .",
    "such a strong break is not expected from the afterglow theory ( zhang 2007 ) , and inconsistent with the agreement of @xmath3 for our fits and near - infrared colors .",
    "since grb afterglows are time - variable , we also examined the time variability of the reduced spectrum , by reproducing two spectra using the first and second halves of the integrations ( 14 and 59 of table [ table : obs ] ) .",
    "we confirmed that there is no statistically significant change in the spectra , and the concave curvature of the residuals for the host - only model is seen in both the spectra .",
    "chornock et al .",
    "( 2013 ) also reported an analysis of the damping wing shape of the same grb afterglow taken by another telescope , and they found no statistically significant preference for the diffuse igm component .",

    "the origin of this difference is difficult to identify , but a clear difference of their analysis from ours is the index of unabsorbed power - law spectrum : @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath67 .",
    "such a small value is significantly different from those measured by near - infrared colors , and it is not supported either from our @xmath3-free fitting analysis , giving an unacceptably large @xmath24 of @xmath68 .",
    "the fit by chornock et al . indeed shows a concave curvature of the observed spectrum compared with the fitted model ( see their fig .",
    "2 ) , and this curvature and their small ( red ) @xmath3 value could be a result of a power - law fit in a wavelength region where the igm / dla component is not negligible .",
    "as already presented , the evidence for the intervening h absorption presented above can be explained by a dla associated with the observed metal absorption system at @xmath51 , if the h column density is @xmath69 .",
    "here we examine whether this scenario is consistent with other observed features of the grb 130606a afterglow spectrum .",
    "the expected number of such a dla along the line of sight can be estimated as follows .",
    "a modest extrapolation of the dla statistics up to @xmath70 ( wolfe et al . 2005 ; songaila & cowie 2010 ) suggests the dla number distribution per unit redshift @xmath71 at @xmath72 for @xmath73 . assuming the column density distribution as @xmath74 again from the lower-@xmath75 sample , the probability of finding such a dla in the redshift range between 5.806 and 5.913 is estimated to be @xmath76 .",
    "therefore the chance probability of finding such a dla is rather small , though it is not negligible .",
    "the existence of such a large column dla at @xmath51 can be further constrained by the spectral profiles around lyman series absorption at this redshift , because absorption by h in the dla would erase the transmission of light around this redshift .",

    "the relative velocity difference of these lines are at most @xmath78 km / s .",
    "the metal absorption line profile of typical dlas is a mixture of multiple components with a velocity width of @xmath797 km / s for one component , and the relative velocity width @xmath80 of different components is widely distributed in @xmath2020200 km / s ( wolfe et al .",

    "[ fig : ly_prof ] must be consistent with the predicted attenuation factor by the dla , and the transmissions around ly@xmath1 and @xmath45 satisfy this requirement , if the spectral resolution is taken into account .",

    "this transmission profile has a width comparable with the spectral resolution , indicating a narrow intrinsic width .",
    "furthermore , the light attenuation by the assumed dla becomes rapidly stronger beyond 6977  , which also requires that the transmission is coming from a narrow ( @xmath84 1  ) wavelength window .",
    "this means that the transmission flux density must be @xmath85 @xmath86 , which should be compared with the unabsorbed continuum flux @xmath87 @xmath86 estimated by the continuum flux at 9800   and an extrapolation by using the best - fit power - law @xmath88 of the intervening dla model ( table [ table : parameters ] ) . here",
    ", these flux estimates of the transmission and unabsorbed continuum were made from the 300r spectrum that covers ly@xmath3 and 9800   simultaneously , and hence we do not have to consider the time evolution of the flux .",

    "we examined possible systematic uncertainties about the relative flux calibration at 6977 and 9800   ( by aperture loss , atmospheric dispersion , guide error , standard star , and wavelength - dependent seeing ) , and it should be less than 10% . a change of @xmath3 by 0.1 results in just a 3% change of the unabsorbed flux at the ly@xmath3 wavelength .",
    "it should also be noted that the modeling about velocity distribution of h in the dla hardly affects this argument , because the 6977   transmission is far from the resonant ly@xmath3 wavelength and the attenuation is simply determined by the damping wing .",
    "therefore , the h column density of the @xmath51 system must be lower than the value required to explain the residual of the host - only model .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath51 system has a similar metallicity to the grb host galaxy , a reasonable amount of the h column density would be @xmath90 , since the metal - line equivalent widths ( si , o , and c ) of the @xmath51 system are about 39 times lower than those found in the grb host galaxy ( chornock et al .",
    "flux attenuation factors assuming this h column density are also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ly_prof ] , and in this case ly@xmath3 absorption at 6977   is negligible , thus allowing the existence of the observed transmission there",
    ". such a small h column density does not affect the fitting of the ly@xmath1 damping wing at the grb redshift .",
    "finally , we note that the simple diffuse igm models with uniform @xmath91 is also mathematically excluded by the light transmission at 6977  , because of the large predicted ly@xmath3 gp optical depth of @xmath92 at @xmath93 using the absorption oscillator strength ratio of @xmath94 .",
    "however , in reality the neutral fraction can not be perfectly homogeneous , and many transmission spikes are expected at locally ionized bubbles along the sightlines , as seen in the spectrum of this grb ( chornock et al .",
    "therefore , a transmission spike at 6977  does not exclude any realistic models of diffuse igm absorption .",
    "finally , even if the large column of @xmath95 is associated with the @xmath96 system , the metallicity of this system must then be extremely low . from the reported equivalent widths of the si , o , and c lines ( chornock et al .",
    "2013 ) and this h column , we estimate the metallicity of [ si / h ] , [ o / h ] , and [ c / h ] to be @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , respectively , in the optically - thin limit . here",
    "we followed the usual practice for dla studies and did not apply ionization correction , because these low - ionization atoms are the dominant phase of these elements in interstellar medium .",
    "these lines may be saturated , and hence we estimated the metal column density considering the saturation effect , assuming that these lines have a single component of @xmath81 km / s .",
    "then the metallicities are increased to @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "( note that the saturation effect would be weaker than this , if these lines are composed of multiple components . )",
    "the saturation effect is not large for the weak line of si , and [ si / h ] of this system must be significantly lower than the lowest value ( @xmath103 ) found for dlas at lower redshifts up to @xmath70 ( rafelski et al .",
    "2012 ) . in comparison with a theoretical model of finlator",
    "et al . ( 2013 ) , the saturation - corrected column density of @xmath104 for a dla having @xmath105 at @xmath6 is outside the @xmath106-@xmath18 distribution of 99% sightlines . we have already argued that the ly@xmath3 profile excludes the particular case of the dla at @xmath51 as an explanation of the residuals found in the host - only fit , and one may consider the possibility of a dla at a different redshift to save the intervening dla scenario .",
    "however , in this case the dla metallicity must be further lower than the values estimated above , because there are no detected metal absorption lines .",
    "we presented an analysis of the redward ly@xmath1 damping wing found in the optical afterglow spectrum of grb 130606a at @xmath0 , for the purpose of getting constraints on cosmic reionization .",
    "we used the spectrum in the narrow wavelength range of 84008900  , which was specially reduced for the particular purpose of the damping wing analysis to minimize systematic uncertainties . the minimal model including the unabsorbed baseline power - law and h absorption in the host galaxy does not give a good fit , leaving residuals showing a concave curvature whose amplitude is about 0.6% of the flux .",
    "such a curvature in the short wavelength range can not be explained by extinction at the host galaxy , if we adopt the standard extinction curves , because the standard curves have monotonic wavelength dependence in this wavelength range , and change of extinction is almost perfectly absorbed by according change of the power - law index @xmath3 .",
    "we can not exclude an unknown anomalous behavior of extinction curve in this wavelength range , but if this is the case , it would have interesting implications for the physics of interstellar dust grains in the early universe .",
    "we have also examined various sources of systematic uncertainties in the observed spectrum and model fitting procedures ( section [ section : systematics ] ) , but we can not resolve the residuals of the host - only model .",
    "this motivated us to test intervening h absorption components along the line of sight , and we found that both diffuse igm and a dla at the redshift of an observed metal absorption system ( @xmath96 ) can reduce the residual , with statistical significances of about 3@xmath2 .",
    "this is the first evidence for intervening neutral hydrogen outside the host galaxy , found in the red damping wing of grb afterglow spectra .",
    "we then examined the consistency of the dla scenario with other observed features in the spectrum ( section [ section : dla ] ) .",
    "probability of finding such a dla along the sightline is rather small ( @xmath203% ) .",
    "the particular case of the @xmath51 dla can be excluded from the light transmission profile around ly@xmath3 .",
    "the metallicity argument also severely constrains this scenario .",
    "even if the dla is associated with the @xmath51 metal absorption system , its silicon abundance must be about 1/2000 times the solar level , which is significantly lower than the lowest known metallicity ( @xmath107 ) of dlas at @xmath108 and theoretical expectation at @xmath17 .",
    "if the dla is located at a redshift different from 5.806 , no detected metal lines require an even lower metallicity .",
    "therefore we conclude that the intervening dla scenario does not provide a reasonable explanation for the residuals of the host - only model .",
    "if the dla scenario was correct , it would imply a rapid increase of the incidence of extremely low metallicity dlas around @xmath6 , which would give an interesting constraint on the theory of early galaxy formation .",
    "hence , there are good reasons to seriously consider the possibility that the observed absorption feature is made by neutral hydrogen in diffuse igm .",
    "if correct , it can be interpreted as the remnant of neutral igm at the relatively late phase of reionization .",
    "the best - fit igm neutral fraction varies depending on the upper redshift bound , from @xmath109 for @xmath110 to @xmath111 for @xmath47 ( the upper bound of the darkest gp troughs to this sightline ) .",
    "these values are interestingly close to unity , but quantitatively should be taken with care , because the adopted igm model ( uniform density and @xmath11 ) is obviously too simple ( mcquinn et al . 2008 ; mesinger & furlanetto 2008 ) .",
    "ly@xmath112 transmission spikes are found between the dark gp troughs from @xmath113 to the grb redshift ( chornock et al .",
    "2013 ) , and @xmath5 can not be such a high value at the spike regions . on the other hand , theory predicts that reionization proceeds inhomogeneously ( e.g. , iliev et al . 2006 ) , and high @xmath5 gas can be hidden in clumpy igm corresponding to dark gp troughs . a comparison with more realistic theoretical models would place more quantitative constraints on the reionization history .    it should be noted that the red damping wing signature of absorption by intervening neutral hydrogen has also been reported for a quasar at an even higher redshift of @xmath114 ( mortlock et al .",
    "2011 ; bolton et al . 2011 ) , whose column density is similar to that found for grb 130606a . indirect evidence for the damping wing by highly neutral igm has also been claimed in quasar spectra at @xmath6 ( schroeder et al .",
    "2013 ) . since grbs are less biased tracers and do not alter the surrounding ionization status , it is reasonable to expect a higher @xmath5 in regions around grb host galaxies than quasars at the same redshift .",
    "these quasar results and the new result of grb 130606a suggest that the cosmic reionization is not yet complete at @xmath6 , and we are now starting to detect the remnant neutral hydrogen from the universe before reionization in various environments .",
    "our result demonstrates that damping wing analyses of grb afterglows give useful constraints on reionization .",
    "it is sensitive to the igm neutral fraction of @xmath115 for h gas close to the host , or @xmath111 for that separated from the host by @xmath116 or 5 mpc in proper distance .",
    "more high quality spectra of grb afterglows in the reionization era would give us a more complete picture of reionization history in the near future , which will be made possible by planned 3040 m class telescopes .    the spectrum used in this work",
    "was collected at the subaru telescope , which is operated by the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
