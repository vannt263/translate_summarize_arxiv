    "g156.2@xmath05.7 is a large ( radius@xmath150@xmath2 ) , x - ray bright supernova remnant ( snr ) discovered by the rosat all - sky survey ( pfeffermann et al .",
    "the rosat 0.12.4kev band spectrum was well represented by emission from a thin thermal plasma with a temperature of about 0.5kev .",
    "a sedov analysis based on the x - ray data showed a very low density medium of 0.01@xmath5 , an age of @xmath126000yr , and a distance to the remnant of @xmath13kpc .",
    "subsequently , successful x - ray observations were performed with ginga and asca . using non - imaging instruments on board ginga , yamauchi et al .",
    "( 1993 ) found that the scan profile in the 1.23kev energy band was similar to the soft x - ray image observed with rosat , while the scan profile above 3kev revealed two bumps near to the north and south edges of the remnant .",
    "asca observed the northern and central portions of the remnant ( yamauchi et al .",
    "asca spectra from both north and central portions were characterized by soft and hard - tail components .",
    "the soft component was dominated by line emission , and originated from non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) plasma . a revised sedov analysis based on the spectral parameters determined by the soft component resulted in a low ambient density of @xmath10.2@xmath5 , an age of @xmath115000yr , and a distance of @xmath11.3kpc . on the other hand ,",
    "the hard - tail component was most likely represented by a power - law type spectrum , i.e. , synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons .",
    "the distance to g156.2@xmath05.7 has not yet been established .",
    "gerardy & fesen ( 2007 ) discovered considerable faint h@xmath6 line emission coincident with x - ray emission .",
    "since some of them seems to be associated with interstellar clouds located at a distance of 0.3kpc , they argued that the distance to the remnant might be closer than that was estimated previously .",
    "we here take 1kpc as a distance to the remnant , following the most recent paper on g156.2@xmath05.7 ( xu et al.2007 ) .",
    "radio observations show a bilateral shell structure having relatively weak emission at the central portion of the remnant ( reich et al .",
    "although the radio surface brightness was the lowest among all known snrs , a magnetic field in the shell was estimated to be 16@xmath7 g ( at a distance of 1kpc ) which is just slightly higher than a typical interstellar magnetic field .",
    "therefore , reich et al .  ( 1992 ) concluded that the low surface brightness was due to the low ambient density .",
    "polarized radio emission shows a nearly perfect tangential magnetic field configuration along the shell , which is typical for evolved shell - type snrs ( reich et al .",
    "1992 ; xu et al .",
    "all the observations agree that g156.2@xmath05.7 is a middle - aged snr whose sn explosion occurred in a low - density ambient medium .",
    "we focus on both thermal and non - thermal x - ray emission in this snr , using the most recent x - ray astronomy satellite suzaku ( mitsuda et al .",
    "the fact that non - thermal x - ray emission is detected from this middle - aged snr is very interesting , since a currently accepted theory of diffusive shock acceleration requires high shock velocity of at least @xmath12000kmsec@xmath4 which is not expected in middle - aged snrs to produce non - thermal emission in the x - ray domain .",
    "fortunately , the thermal emission from this snr allows us to investigate ambient medium densities as well as the shock velocities which are important to study the theory of diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "another interesting aspect of this remnant is a clear evidence of si and s rich ejecta detected in the central portion of the remnant with asca ( yamauchi et al .",
    "we can investigate the progenitor star which produced this snr , by comparing the relative metal abundances of the ejecta with those expected in nucleosynthetic models .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig1.eps    we observed the eastern ( e ) rim , the northwestern ( nw ) rim , and the central portion of g156.2@xmath05.7 during 2007 february 1620 with the suzaku satellite .",
    "we here concentrate on the data taken by the x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; koyama et al .",
    "2007 ) onboard suzaku .",
    "the xis consists of two front - illuminated ( fi ; xis0 and xis3 ) ccd cameras and one back - illuminated ( bi ; xis1 ) ccd camera .",
    "each camera covers an identical imaging area of 17@xmath2.8@xmath817@xmath2.8 .",
    "the fields of view ( fov ) of xis for the three observations are shown as white boxes in the entire x - ray image of the snr obtained by the rosat pspc ( figure  [ fig : rosat ] ) .",
    "we reprocessed the xis data , using the latest cti calibration file of version 20080131 .",
    "we cleaned the reprocessed data by the standard criteria recommended by the calibration team of suzaku / xis .",
    "after the screening , the remaining exposure times were 53.3ks for the e rim , 50.5ksec for the nw rim , and 51.2ksec for the central portion , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : xis_image ] shows the vignetting - corrected xis0 images of the three observations .",
    "two corners of each fov where the calibration source of @xmath9fe is illuminated are masked in these images .",

    "figure  [ fig : whole_spec ] shows xis0 spectra extracted from the entire fov for each observation .",
    "the non x - ray background ( nxb ; see the next subsection for an explanation ) spectra are also shown as red crosses .",
    "the signal - to - noise ( black - to - red in figure  [ fig : whole_spec ] ) ratios in an energy band of 35kev significantly vary among the three fov , indicating a non - uniformity of the hard - tail emission detected by ginga and asca ( yamauchi et al .  1993 ; 1999 ) .",
    "also notable is a variation of equivalent widths of k - shell lines from si ( at @xmath11.85kev ) and s ( at @xmath12.4kev ) ; those in the central spectrum are much larger than those in the rim spectra .",
    "this implies the existence of the fossil ejecta in the central portion as was detected with asca ( yamauchi et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the following spectral fitting procedure , we use photons in the energy range of 0.48.0kev , and employ the xspec ( version 12.4.0 ) software .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig3a.eps ( 80mm,80mm)fig3b.eps ( 80mm,80mm)fig3c.eps    as background , we consider three kinds of sources ; nxb caused by charged particles and @xmath10-rays hitting the detectors , cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) which accounts for emission from unresolved point sources , and local hot bubble ( lhb ) that is a hot gas surrounding the earth . note that galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) is negligible for this snr ; based on literature by sugizaki et al .  ( 2001 ) and revnivtsev et al .  ( 2006 ) , we estimate the flux of grxe at the galactic longitude , @xmath11 , @xmath11 = 100@xmath12 within galactic latitudes , @xmath13 , @xmath14 to be 4@xmath810@xmath15erg@xmath16sec@xmath4arcmin@xmath17 in a range of 0.710kev , which is about 0.3% of that from g156.2@xmath05.7 ( yamauchi et al .",
    "furthermore , the larger values of @xmath18 and @xmath19 for this snr would prefer the smaller flux of grxe .",
    "we generate nxb spectra suitable for our observations , by employing xisnxbgen provided by the xis team ( tawa et al.2008 ) .",
    "the generated nxb spectra are shown in figure  [ fig : whole_spec ] , in which we can see that the nxb spectra above 8kev , where emission from astrophysical sources is negligible , match the data .",
    "therefore , we are confident that nxb emission is properly subtracted by the nxb spectra generated by xisnxbgen .",
    "we subtract nxb emission from the same area as the source area in detector coordinates . for the cxb emission , we employ broken power - law model with photon indices @xmath20 ( @xmath210.7kev ) @xmath22 2.0 and @xmath20 ( @xmath230.7kev ) @xmath22 1.4 ( e.g. , miller et al .",
    "2008 ) . as for the lhb component",
    ", we use the apec model ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ) with solar composition ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) and an electron temperature of 0.1kev ( e.g. , tawa 2008 ) .",
    "we estimate the emission measure of the lhb component around g156.2@xmath05.7 to be 2@xmath24pc@xmath25 , based on the surface brightness in the rosat pspc r1 and r2 bands of @xmath12.8 countssec@xmath4arcmin@xmath17 .",
    "we exclude two point - like sources visible in our fov from our spectral analyses ; the regions excluded are enclosed by dashed circles as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xis_image ] .      we perform annular spectral analyses for the e and nw rims .",
    "we choose the center of the x - ray snr at position ( ra , dec)@xmath22 ( , ) [ j2000.0 ] determined by a rosat pspc surface brightness contour . for the e rim , the annular regions are spaced by 4@xmath2 from a radial position , r @xmath26 to r @xmath27 , resulting in four annular regions ( from e1 at the outermost region to e4 at the innermost region ) .",
    "these annular regions are shown in figure  [ fig : xis_image ] as white curves .",
    "we perform spectral fittings for the nxb - subtracted spectra .",
    "since previous asca observations showed non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) states in this snr , we apply an absorbed nei model ( vnei model [ e.g. , borkowski et al .  2001 ] ) having lhb and cxb components for all the four spectra .",
    "the free parameters are the hydrogen column density , @xmath28 ; electron temperature , @xmath29 ; the ionization timescale , @xmath30 ( @xmath30 is the product of the electron density multiplied by the time after the shock heating ) ; the emission measure , em ( em@xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the number densities of electrons and protons , respectively and @xmath34 is the plasma depth ) ; abundances of n , o , ne , mg , si , s , and fe . the other elemental abundances are assumed to the solar values ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) , since emission lines from these elements can not be seen in the suzaku spectra .",
    "we first allow the normalization of the cxb component to vary .",
    "we then find that the mean flux of the cxb component derived in the four annular regions is 4.7@xmath35 erg@xmath16sec@xmath4arcmin@xmath17 in 2.010.0kev .",
    "this is consistent with the cxb flux of 4.4@xmath810@xmath36 erg@xmath16sec@xmath4arcmin@xmath17 estimated by blank sky observations with suzaku ( tawa 2008 ) .",
    "since the cxb flux fluctuates by about 10% from location to location , we take the mean cxb flux derived in the four annular regions as a local flux around this snr . after fixing the normalization of the cxb to the mean flux",
    ", we fit all the spectra with a one - component vnei model .",
    "this model gives us fairly good fits for all the spectra ; the reduced-@xmath37 values ( d.o.f . ) range from 1.04 ( 753 ) to 1.27 ( 837 ) .",
    "no additional power - law component for possible hard - tail emission is required at a 99% confidence level .",
    "therefore , we consider that this model well represents the spectra in the e rim .",
    "we use this cxb flux value in the following analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : ex_spec ] ( a ) shows the example spectrum ( from e3 ) with the best - fit model .",
    "the best - fit parameters for the four spectra are listed in table  [ tab : param1 ] .",
    "we find that the values of @xmath29 significantly decreases toward the shock front from 0.44kev to 0.28kev .",
    "this trend is generally seen either in sedov - phase snrs or behind the shock fronts interacting with dense interstellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g. , miyata & tsunemi 1999 ; levenson et al .",
    "2005 ; hwang et al .",
    "the measured abundances are almost constant in the fov .",
    "the typical abundance of 0.5 times the solar value is consistent with those derived in the northern rim of this snr obtained with asca ( yamauchi et al .",
    "the sub solar abundance leads us to consider that the origin of the plasma in the e rim is the ism swept - up by the forward shock .",
    "we should note that the n abundance is depleted to at least 0.1 times the solar value which is not expected in the ism plasma . in our data , it is quite difficult to establish whether or not this strong depletion is real , given the fact that we do not know the composition of contaminants built up on the optical blocking filters of the xis ( koyama et al .",
    "2007 ) in addition to weak n emission lines from g156.2@xmath05.7 .",

    "the abundances derived by the vnei component responsible for the soft emission from g156.2@xmath05.7 are similar to those observed in the e rim , suggesting that the origin of the plasma in the nw rim is also the swept - up ism .",

    "2003 ) , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the shock velocity and @xmath73 is the so - called gyrofactor , i.e. , the ratio of the particle mean free path to the gyroradius , and represents the efficiency of particle acceleration . combining the above two equations , we can derive the following equation , @xmath74 substituting the measured @xmath64 of 1.5@xmath65hz and the forward shock velocity of 500kmsec@xmath4 , we obtain the value of @xmath73 to be 48 ( if thermal equilibration has not achieved yet behind the shock front , the shock velocity will be faster than 500kmsec@xmath4 so that @xmath73 will be larger than 48 ) . thus , the particle acceleration is much less efficient than that taken place in the rxj1713.7 - 3946 snr , in which we see the extreme bohm diffusion limit , @xmath75 1 ( uchiyama et al .  2007 ) .",
    "therefore , the fact that the slow ( @xmath1500kmsec@xmath4 ) shock in g156.2@xmath05.7 produces non - thermal x - ray emission turns out to be acceptable from a theoretical point of view of diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "we consider that the detection of non - thermal x - ray emission associated with the slow shock in g156.2@xmath05.7 is just simply because the flux ratio of non - thermal to thermal emission in this snr is higher than those in the general middle - aged snrs where non - thermal x - ray emission is not detected .",
    "ellison et al .",
    "( 2000 ) argued that a weak ambient magnetic field and/or a low ambient density yield the high flux ratio between non - thermal and thermal emission .",
    "as for the ambient density , we obtain similar ambient densities between the e rim ( 0.093@xmath5 ) and the nw rim ( 0.087@xmath5 ) .",
    "however , we did not detect significant non - thermal emission from the e rim , but detected it only from the nw rim .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the magnetic field plays an important role to the non - thermal / thermal flux ratio for the case of g156.2@xmath05.7 .",
    "we discuss the nature of the central non - thermal emission in g156.2@xmath05.7 .",
    "the central bump isolated from both the northern and the southern shell in the radio image reminds us of a plerion for the nature of the central non - thermal emission , although there is no apparent counterpart of a pulsar / pulsar wind nebula .",
    "xu et al.(2007 ) conclude that the emission from the central portion came from the shell of the snr rather than a plerion because radio spectra do not show spectral flattening in the central portion of the remnant which is expected in the case of pulsar wind nebula . in principle",
    ", it is possible for the shell to be projected to the center of the snr . in the simulations of orlando et al .",
    "( 2007 ) to investigate the origin of the asymmetries in bilateral snrs , we find such an example . in the paper",
    ", we find that the radio morphology of g156.2@xmath05.7 is similar to the surface brightness of non - thermal emission expected in a situation that the bilateral radio limbs are parallel to the ambient magnetic field and a gradient of ambient density is perpendicular to the magnetic field ( see figure 5 in orlando et al .  2007 ) .",
    "although the possibility that the central non - thermal emission is a plerion can not be completely ruled out , it is preferred that the central non - thermal emission is associated with the shell of the snr .",
    "further x - ray observations around the central portion of the snr will allow us to investigate a detailed variation of spectral index around the center of the snr .",
    "if we see strong spectral variation , as is generally seen in pulsar wind nebulae ( e.g. , petre et al .  2007 ) , the origin would be most likely a plerion , otherwise the central non - thermal emission is associated with the shell of the snr .",
    "we have observed the middle - aged snr g156.2@xmath05.7 with the suzaku satellite in three pointings which are targeted at the e rim and the nw rim , and the central portion of the snr .",
    "hard - tail x - ray emission is detected in the nw rim and the central portion , while it is not significantly detected in the e rim .",
    "the distribution of the hard - tail emission seems to be coincident with that of the radio non - thermal emission .",
    "also , multi - wavelength emission is well represented by a so - called srcut model .",
    "these facts lead us to conclude that the hard - tail emission originates from non - thermal synchrotron emission .",
    "the velocity of the forward shock which likely produces the non - thermal x - ray emission in the nw rim is estimated to be @xmath1500kmsec@xmath4 , assuming thermal equilibrium between ions and electrons .",
    "the shock might be the slowest among those having non - thermal emission in the x - ray wavelength .",
    "the relative abundances in the ejecta component suggests that the origin of g156.2@xmath05.7 is a core - collapse sn explosion whose progenitor is a relatively low - mass star of @xmath115m@xmath3 .",
