    "magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) spectroscopy  @xcite entails the ability to calculate all mhd perturbations accessible to a particular magnetized plasma configuration ( the _ forward _ spectral problem ) , and holds the promise to use the mhd spectrum to diagnose the internal plasma state ( the _ backward _ spectral problem ) . in this letter",
    ", we predict all mhd waves and instabilities for magnetized accretion disks .",
    "to analyse the entire mhd spectrum of gravitationally and thermally stratified , rotating , magnetized equilibrium configurations , we use the formalism of  @xcite .",

    "equation  ( [ fr ] ) describes all waves supported by a time - invariant equilibrium with density @xmath6 , pressure @xmath7 , flow field @xmath8 , gravity @xmath5 , and @xmath4 ; @xmath9 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "we specify our analysis to one - dimensional ( 1d ) axisymmetric stationary equilibria satisfying @xmath10 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate @xmath11 from a @xmath12 cylindrical system .",
    "hence , we concentrate on wave motions about an equilibrium where centrifugal forces , gravity , pressure gradients and magnetic forces balance",
    ". the one - dimensionality limits the generality by representing the gravitational influence of a central body of mass @xmath13 by a line source @xmath14 , but this at most introduces a vertical wavelength cut - off on the validity of our results .",
    "the equilibrium symmetry allows for a decoupled analysis of individual normal mode solutions where @xmath15 . for the radially varying magnetized equilibria , it is instructive to use a field line projection which introduces the basic variables @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "it is then a matter of algebra to turn the frieman - rotenberg system  ( [ fr ] ) into @xmath19 \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } { \\hat{\\chi}}\\\\ { \\hat{\\eta}}\\\\ { \\hat{\\zeta}}\\end{array } \\right ) & = 0 . &   \\label{s3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this system , the radial derivative operator is denoted by @xmath20 , while the parallel gradient operator becomes the algebraic factor @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the latter measures the deviation from a keplerian disk .",
    "the terms linearly proportional to the doppler shifted frequency @xmath24 represent the coriolis effect . for static cylindrical equilibria without external gravitational field , this representation of the eigenvalue problem",
    "was introduced in  @xcite . from equation  ( [ s3 ] )",
    ", one can immediately obtain the alfvn and slow continuous parts of the ideal mhd spectrum by looking at extreme localization of the perturbations on single flux surfaces ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the first component can then be integrated at once , and , when inserted in the second and third , yields @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the alfvn continuum corresponds to singular solutions @xmath28 , where @xmath29 .",
    "the slow modes are given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 .",
    "due to the radial variation of the equilibrium and the doppler shift , four continuous ranges of real eigenfrequencies are found . with the cluster points @xmath32 for the fast subspectrum , these doppler shifted forward and backward alfvn and slow continua determine the three - fold structure of the mhd spectrum .",
    "these continua are not influenced by gravity or rotation .",
    "an interesting limit of this system has obtained a lot of attention in the accretion disk literature .",
    "considering a weakly magnetized accretion disk , it is possible to show that the combination of differential rotation with a weak magnetic field introduces a linear ` weak - field shearing ' mhd instability  @xcite .",
    "as recently discussed in the review by  @xcite , one can derive a sixth order dispersion relation governing local linear disturbances with purely vertical wave numbers @xmath33 in disks where the restricted hydrodynamic equilibrium relation @xmath34 holds . this dispersion relation for axisymmetric @xmath35 modes",
    "is formally found from equation  ( [ s3 ] ) by setting @xmath36 , neglecting all curvature terms where @xmath37 appears explicitly , and by using @xmath34 .",

    "this equation suggests marginal stability for @xmath41 .",

    "either of the formalisms given by the set  ( [ s3 ] ) , system  ( [ s2 ] ) , or the equivalent second order sturm - liouville type equation can be used to analyse the mhd spectrum of magnetized accretion disks . in particular , assuming a radial variation @xmath49 we obtain a local dispersion relation given by @xmath50 similar to the static case , or the more general one including flow  @xcite , one can prove the proportionality @xmath51 , so that the continua @xmath52 can be factored out .",
    "this leaves a sixth order polynomial in @xmath53 which governs all discrete local modes . again , as a formal limit obtained by nullifying terms where @xmath54 , @xmath55 , or @xmath37 appears explicitly , and assuming a keplerian equilibrium @xmath56 , this polynomial is the dispersion relation  ( [ disp ] ) .",
    "the more general relation  ( [ dloc ] ) leads immediately to the following marginal stability criterion governing axisymmetric perturbations when @xmath57 @xmath58 the multiplicative factor @xmath59 highlights the essential magnetic character of this criterion . for non - vanishing @xmath37 , even the @xmath35 case of equation  ( [ dloc ] ) allows for overstable or damped mhd waves .",

    "high @xmath54 non - axisymmetric instabilities can be inferred from  ( [ hddisp ] ) , which simplifies in the incompressible limit ( @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) to a bi - squared relation . for weakly magnetized disks , the modes contained in the dispersion relation  ( [ hddisp ] ) will be complemented by alfvnic and slow magnetosonic perturbations .",
    "with the general formalism for a complete normal mode analysis of magnetized accretion disks in place , we present in the remainder full mhd spectra for a specific thin disk model satisfying  ( [ eq ] ) .",
    "we use an analytical model of a disk where the ratio @xmath75 is @xmath11-independent .",
    "two other parameters are the constant helicity of the magnetic field @xmath76 , and the disk aspect ratio @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the disk scale height .",
    "if one neglects radiative pressure in the disk , @xmath79 measures the ratio of the sound to the keplerian speed @xmath80 @xcite . because of the newtonian gravitational field , we describe the physical quantities using radial power laws . to have a constant @xmath79 , @xmath81 must scale as @xmath82 .",
    "the density profile is set to @xmath83 . for the pressure and magnetic field we use the @xmath82 scaling of @xmath81 and the constant @xmath84 . the inner radius , the density and the keplerian velocity at the inner radius make all quantities dimensionless .",

    "we present two calculations for a weakly magnetized accretion disk .",
    "we set the parameter @xmath97 .",
    "similar to  @xcite , we first take a purely vertical wave vector @xmath98",
    ". the vertical wavelength should not exceed the vertical size of the disk . in fig .",
    "( [ fig1 ] ) , we show the mhd spectrum .",
    "we can identify all modes in this plot : the fast - magnetosonic , epicyclic , and ( overlapping ) alfvn and slow - magnetosonic continuum modes are all on the real axis . a dense sequence of discrete modes appears on the imaginary axis : the magneto - rotational instability .",
    "this sequence is the unstable part of the slow magnetosonic subspectrum . performing the same calculation for @xmath99 ( hydrodynamical case ) ,",
    "only the epicyclic and sonic modes remain and no unstable mode is found , confirming its slow magnetosonic nature .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) the spectrum for non - axisymmetric perturbations with @xmath100 .",
    "note the asymmetry due to the doppler shift @xmath101 .",
    "the identification of the different modes is quite involved since the fast , slow , alfvn and epicyclic frequency ranges are all overlapping .",
    "various branches of unstable modes can be seen , where only the rightmost branches correspond to their axisymmetric analogues already present in figure  ( [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the structure suggests the presence of global modes accumulating towards both the alfvn and the slow continua .",
    "a full mhd spectroscopic analysis , which investigates the mode types from their specific polarization properties , is the subject of future work .",
    "we performed several calculations of mhd perturbations supported by disks where the magnetic pressure is of the same order as the thermal one .",
    "the results we have obtained are quite clear .",
    "if the perturbation is non - axisymmetric , unstable branches appear in the spectra .",
    "the growth rate of these instabilities grows for increasing @xmath54 . for the disk equilibrium discussed above",
    ", no axisymmetric unstable modes are found . the spectral structure is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) for @xmath102 .",
    "because all the terms in eq .",
    "( [ s2 ] ) are of the same order , a purely analytical approach is virtually impossible .",
    "we applied a general formalism to an astrophysical system where most mhd instabilities are believed to occur : the accretion disk .",
    "our analysis covers both unmagnetized and magnetized disks .",
    "complete mhd spectra were presented for equilibria involving the gravity of a central object , velocities @xmath103 and @xmath91 , and both thermal pressure and a magnetic field with azimuthal and vertical components .",
    "we deduced the relations  ( [ dloc ] ) , ( [ m0b0 ] ) , ( [ hddisp ] ) , describing the threshold of several known instabilities for a differentially rotating fluid , including the papaloizou - pringle modes and the weak - field magneto - rotational one .",
    "the relations apply to fully compressible , non - keplerian magnetized disks .",
    "if one ignores vertical stratification , they generalize the analysis of  @xcite , who considered only @xmath35 modes when no azimuthal @xmath37 field was present .",
    "we complemented our analytical approach with numerical calculations of mhd spectra of a realistic magnetized disk model .",
    "mhd spectra for weakly magnetized accretion disks contain the magneto - rotational instability and several other branches of discrete unstable modes .",
    "we numerically found a variety of toroidal unstable modes which can affect equipartion accretion disks .",
    "our results are consistent with  @xcite who made an analysis of non - axisymmetric incompressible modes in accretion disks , and found alfvnic instabilities for strong magnetic fields .",
    "we generalize their findings by considering all mhd modes .",
    "instabilities at equipartition field strengths are of big interest since it is believed that magnetized disks launching mhd jets have a thermal pressure of the same order as the magnetic one  @xcite .",
    "@xcite have pointed out the importance of anomalous transport produced by non - singular , non - axisymmetric bending modes for the regime of large magnetic energy density .",
    "these modes are amongst the instabilities analysed here .",
    "a complete mhd spectroscopic study for these and other ( also 2d ) accretion disk equilibria will be presented in future work  @xcite .",
    "since the mhd spectrum for disks which are weakly magnetized or at equipartition field strengths shows this enormous variety of unstable modes , the description of mhd turbulence in magnetized accretion disks is far from complete .",
    "follow - up nonlinear simulations should reveal the importance of the various modes for triggering and sustaining mhd turbulence .",
    "the analytical framework presented can be of interest for physical mechanisms involving disk instabilities , such as the ` accretion - ejection instability '  @xcite and the hydrodynamical rossby vortices  @xcite .",
    "the study of instabilities affecting radially stratified mhd jets  @xcite is embedded in the present formalism .",
