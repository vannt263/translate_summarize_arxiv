    "for the past quarter of a century the luminosity distribution of galaxies has been represented by a schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) .",
    "this contains three defining parameters ( see eqn .",
    "[ eq : sch ] ) and from these parameters one can derive useful quantities such as the mean local luminosity density . over the past decade",
    "many measurements of the schechter parameters have been made ( e.g. efstathiou , ellis & peterson , 1988 ; loveday et al .",
    "1992 ; marzke et al .",
    "1994 , 1998 ; zucca et al . ,",
    "however when compared , the results from these recent surveys show a wide range in the derived schechter parameters , cross et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and hence a wide range in the inferred luminosity density .",
    "the two most likely culprits for this variation are : cosmic variance and/or surface brightness selection bias ( e.g. disney 1976 ; phillipps , davies & disney 1990 ) . in cross",
    "et al . ( 2001 ) these two errors were quantified for a sample of 45,000 galaxies drawn from the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) .",
    "the conclusion was that both of these issues are significant and can potentially lead to significant underestimates of the local luminosity density ( @xmath24few % for cosmic variance and @xmath2435% for surface brightness biases ) .",
    "the surface brightness biases can be separated into two distinct parts ; a surface brightness dependent photometric bias and a surface brightness dependent malmquist bias .",
    "the biggest effect comes from the former , i.e. underestimating the total magnitudes ( 25% ) .",
    "the remaining contribution comes from overestimating the volume over which a galaxy can be seen ( 10% ) .",
    "cross et al .",
    "( 2001 ) advocated the construction of a bivariate brightness distribution ( bbd ) to remove the surface brightness selection biases .",
    "the bbd is the space density of galaxies as a function of the absolute magnitude , @xmath25 , and the absolute surface brightness , @xmath26 .",
    "this process also revealed a number of noteworthy results in its own right : firstly a clear dearth of giant low - surface brightness galaxies ; secondly a clear luminosity - surface brightness correlation ( spanning @xmath27 ) ; and thirdly the general rise in the space - density from giant to dwarf systems to the faint limit ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "some earlier attempts have been made to measure the bbd ( e.g. chooniewski 1985 ; van der kruit 1987 ; sodr & lahav 1993 ) .",
    "these were for small samples of bright galaxies .",
    "the chooniewski sample contained 248 e / s0 galaxies with @xmath29 ; the van der kruit sample contained 51 galaxies with isophotal diameters @xmath30 at 26.5 mag arcsec@xmath6 ( in the photographic iiia - j band ) and the sodr & lahav sample contained 529 galaxies with isophotal diameters @xmath31 at 25.6 - 26.0 mag arcsec@xmath6 in the b - band .",
    "these are very strict limits , and only very intrinsically bright and large galaxies were well sampled .",
    "recently three more extensive and independent measurements of the bivariate brightness distribution have been made .",
    "driver ( 1999 ) derived the bbd for a volume - limited sample drawn from the hubble deep field , de jong & lacey ( 2000 ) studied a homogeneous sample of 1000 late - type spirals and blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) derived the bbd for a sample of 11,275 galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "these three surveys plus cross et al .",
    "( 2001 ) all confirm the existence of the luminosity - surface brightness correlation , demonstrating that _ surface brightness selection biases are luminosity dependent . _",
    "the luminosity - surface brightness correlation is measured to be @xmath32 from ( cross et al .",
    "this equates to @xmath33 . from hubble deep field data , driver ( 1999 )",
    "found a steeper gradient ( @xmath34 ) as did ferguson & binggeli ( 1994 ) in the virgo cluster ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the number density of galaxies is a maximum along this line , falling away at both higher and lower surface brightnesses .",
    "given the luminosity - surface correlation it is hardly surprising if surveys with differing selection criterion recover widely ranging schechter parameters .",
    "a useful next step is to produce an analytical function to fit to these derived bbds . in  2 we show such a function and fit it to the derived 2dfgrs bbd . in ",
    "3 we discuss our fitting procedure and compare it to a similar estimation made by de jong & lacey ( 2000 ) . in ",
    "4 we show how the luminosity density can be calculated from the bbf and compare it to the published values .",
    "finally we explore the scope for error in schechter function estimators if surface brightness selection effects are ignored .",
    "the luminosity function as traditionally described by the schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) , is shown below as eqn .",
    "[ eq : sch ] :    @xmath36    this equation contains three parameters m@xmath37 , @xmath8 & @xmath10 which describe the `` characteristic magnitude '' , the `` normalisation constant '' and the `` faint end slope '' , respectively . containing no surface brightness information this function provides a good fit to the space density of field galaxies",
    "albeit over a fairly restricted range of luminosities ( @xmath38 ) in the field",
    ". however , the schechter function provides a poorer fit to the luminosity distribution in clusters ( e.g. driver et al .",
    "1994 , andreon , cuillandre & pell 2000 ) and when the population is subdivided according to spectral type ( madgwick et al .",
    "current estimates constrain the three schechter parameters , for field galaxies , to lie in the range : @xmath39 resulting in a pessimistic luminosity density range of : @xmath40mpc@xmath1 .",
    "empirically cross et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find that the distribution of the galaxy population in surface brightness appears symmetrical about a ridge and can therefore be described by a gaussian or possibly a quadratic distribution .",
    "the ridge is described by @xmath41 , the luminosity - surface brightness correlation .",
    "clearly a bbf needs to relate closely to the schechter function in luminosity .",
    "hence by multiplying the classical schechter function with a gaussian in surface brightness we can construct the following bbf :    @xmath42 \\\\",
    "\\label{eq : func } \\end{split}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the gradient of the luminosity - surface brightness correlation and @xmath13 is the dispersion in the surface brightness .",
    "this function is identical to that presented by chooniewski ( 1985 ) , and derived by dalcanton , spergel & summers ( 1997 ) and de jong & lacey ( 1999a , b 2000 ) using the fall & efstathiou ( 1980 ) disk - galaxy formation model .",
    "note that the new term contains a normalisation coefficient @xmath43 ensuring that @xmath8 , @xmath21 and @xmath10 are identical to the traditional schechter parameters .",
    "we choose to fit the bbf to the data shown in cross et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; this is the largest available data set .",
    "this bbd was derived from a subset of 45,000 galaxies from the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( see cross et al .",
    "2001 for details ) , and is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( thin contours ) . also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is the selection boundary derived from visibility theory ( shaded region , see appendix b of cross et al .",
    "2001 ) . in the shaded region",
    "insufficient volume is surveyed to make any meaningful statement of the space - densities .",
    "the bbf can be fitted to the bbd by minimising the @xmath44 of the model compared to the data .",
    "the bbf is a non - linear six parameter equation and to find the minimum , we use the levenberg - marquardt method ( see press et al .",
    "1986 ) . the data provided ( see cross et al .",
    "2001 ) is binned as in table c2 of cross et al .",
    "( 2001 ) using those bins whose values are binned on a minimum of 25 galaxies .",
    "the best fit parameters we derive are : @xmath45mpc@xmath1 , @xmath46 mag , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath47 mag arcsec@xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "all errors are @xmath48 errors . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the bbf for these parameters ( thick lines ) overlaid on the data ( thin contour lines ) .",
    "the errors in the parameters were found using a monte - carlo simulation , that is the observed distribution was randomised within the quoted @xmath48 errors and the bbf fit re - derived .",
    "the final bbf fit yields a @xmath49 value of 164 , for @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the no . of data points",
    "- no . of parameters .",
    "this gives a likelihood of @xmath52 .",
    "hence , although the bbf appears to describe the bbd , the fit is poor .",
    "it is important to understand where the differences are occurring . from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we see that the model fits the data well brightwards of @xmath53 , and less well in fainter bins .",
    "the errors become comparable to the space density faintwards of @xmath54 , so the main error in the fit occurs in the range : @xmath55 .",
    "the data ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) show an upturn towards the faint end in this range whereas the schechter function gradually flattens towards the faint end .",
    "thus it is the schechter function part that does not describe the data well .",
    "note that the bbf provides schechter parameters comparable to the range from previous surveys .",
    "the model fits the data well in the surface brightness direction , implying that a gaussian distribution is a good description of the space density as a function of surface brightness , for a constant absolute magnitude .",
    "table  [ table1 ] compares our bbf with the de jong & lacey ( 2000 ) bbf which was determined for sb - sdm galaxies only . as de jong & lacey use 95% confidence intervals for their errors , we have quoted @xmath56 errors rather than @xmath48 errors for our values .",
    "we converted their half - light radii parameters to our effective surface brightness parameters .",
    "de jong & lacey fit disks and exponential bulges to their data , taking into account inclination and internal extinction . in appendix",
    "a , we estimate the uncertainty in our results due to not taking this into account and find that the error is @xmath57 mag in @xmath58 and @xmath59 mag arcsec@xmath6 in @xmath60",
    ". we note that the de jong & lacey ( 2000 ) parameters are their total galaxy parameters , not their disk - only galaxy parameters . in each case , these have been converted to @xmath61-band magnitudes using @xmath62 mag from de jong & lacey ( 2000 ) , and @xmath63 ( maddox , efstathiou & sutherland 1990 ) , using a value of @xmath64 for a late type spiral ( coleman , wu & weedman , 1980 , driver et al .",
    "finally we convert from @xmath65 km s@xmath66mpc@xmath66 to @xmath67 km s@xmath66mpc@xmath66 .",
    "in addition , the de jong & lacey sample has tighter selection criteria and more accurate ccd photometry ( @xmath68 mag compared to @xmath69 mag ) , but it only includes late - type galaxies and has a redshift completeness of 80% compared to @xmath70% for the 2dfgrs . in spite of this , we find a similar spread in @xmath26 ( @xmath13 = @xmath71 q.v .",
    "@xmath72 ) and we find that the @xmath10 values of the two surveys are equal within the errors .",
    "the 2dfgrs has a brighter @xmath21 by 0.05 mag , and a brighter @xmath60 by 0.85 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "taking into account the effects of bulges and inclination as mentioned above , the 2dfgrs distribution has become 0.15 mag brighter than the de jong & lacey distribution and has a brighter @xmath60 by 0.3 mag arcsec@xmath6 . considering that late - type galaxies tend to be fainter and lower surface brightness ,",
    "these results appear fully consistent .",
    "our value of @xmath11 can be converted to a luminosity - scale size gradient @xmath73 .",
    "although this differs from the de jong & lacey ( 2000 ) value , interestingly , it agrees more closely with their theoretical prediction of @xmath74 ( see de jong & lacey 2000 ) .",
    "one possible reason for the variation in @xmath11 may be a correlation between colour and absolute magnitude .",
    "blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find a strong correlation between @xmath75 colour and @xmath76 : brighter galaxies are redder , fainter galaxies are bluer .",

    "( 2001 ) , we find that @xmath77 . using a mean @xmath78 ( calculated from fukugita , shimasaku & ichikawa 1995 and maddox , efstathiou & sutherland 1990 ) , and assuming that the additional colour term @xmath79 we calculate that the expected @xmath80 .",
    "the value estimated from fig .",
    "10 of blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is @xmath81 .",
    "thus the @xmath82 band luminosity - surface brightness correlation appears steeper than the @xmath61 band luminosity - surface brightness correlation .",
    "a similar colour - magnitude correlation in @xmath83 could explain the discrepancy between our result and de jong & lacey ( 2000 ) result .",
    "the general good overall agreement between these substantially different surveys is an important vindication of both results .",
    "cross et al .",
    "( 2001 ) has extended the de jong & lacey conclusions to the full range of galaxy types with @xmath84 . however , the different values obtained for the luminosity surface brightness correlation may reflect a colour or morphologically dependent luminosity - surface brightness correlation . blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) seem to have found similar results , but have not fitted a function or tabulated their results .",
    "as for the schechter function it is trivial to calculate the luminosity density , j , by integrating the product of the bbf and the luminosity over the complete range of surface brightness and absolute magnitude .",
    "@xmath85    the solution is the same as the solution to the integral obtained from the schechter function . when calculated using the best fit parameters , the value of the luminosity density , @xmath86 mpc@xmath1 , rather than the correct value of @xmath87 .",
    "the values for the luminosity density in this paper use the correct value . ] .    in blanton",
    "et al . ( 2001 ) , the sloan team get a @xmath88 higher value for the luminosity density in the @xmath61 filter than the 2dfgrs team .",
    "does this mean that 2dfgrs is missing some galaxies , or at least underestimating their fluxes ?",
    "for a start the values of @xmath21 are consistent , suggesting that both surveys are correcting magnitudes properly .",
    "however the measurement of @xmath8 is over 30% higher in blanton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . a more recent paper ( yasuda et al .",
    "2001 ) revises the sdss luminosity density of blanton et al .",
    ", to @xmath89mpc@xmath1 .",
    "this revision is based on a fit to the galaxy number counts , suggesting that the blanton et al .",
    "region was overdense by 30% .",
    "the revised @xmath8 value ( @xmath90mpc@xmath1 ) is now consistent with our measurement of @xmath91mpc@xmath1 , in the @xmath61 band .    given this revised value of @xmath8 , the blanton result is still 10% higher , but blanton used a colour term @xmath92 , whereas the correct colour term for the apm , tested using eis data is @xmath63 ( peacock , private communication ) .",
    "when these two factors are taken into account , the luminosity densities are entirely consistent .",
    "as demonstrated in cross et al .",
    "( 2001 ) the peak of the luminosity density lies well inside the selection boundaries .",
    "when the function is integrated over the range @xmath93 , @xmath94 , the value obtained is @xmath95mpc@xmath1 as compared to the summed bbd which gives : @xmath96mpc@xmath1 .",
    "these are the approximate selection boundaries , so the correspondence is excellent . unless the distribution shows an upturn outside the selection boundary the 2dfgrs data have uncovered over 98% of the local b - band luminosity density .",
    "in cross et al . ( 2001 ) , fig . 1 showed the variation in the lf as measured from a number of recent redshift surveys .",
    "it was postulated that the large variation was due to surface brightness selection effects . in this section",
    "the variation of the luminosity function with the limiting detection isophote is explored and compared to the range of published luminosity functions . throughout , an exponential surface brightness profile and an einstein - de sitter cosmology are assumed .    to calculate a derived luminosity function , we start with our fit to the bbf .",
    "we take into account the overestimate in @xmath60 by 0.55 mag arcsec@xmath6 , derived in appendix a , and use a value of @xmath97 mag arcsec@xmath6 [ note that in cross et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we used a less sophisticated method to estimate the offset caused by the bulge and arrived at a figure of 0.55 mag arcsec@xmath6 ] .",
    "we multiply our updated bbf by a visibility volume ( cross et al . 2001 ) to construct an apparent observed number in @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( see fig .",

    "the solid angle used was 300@xmath105 .",
    "these parameters are typical of the observed ranges for the most recent surveys .",
    "the only parameter allowed to vary is the detection isophote which took the values 26 , 25 , 24 , 23.5 and 23 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "[ fig : v_m ] shows the complex malmquist bias for @xmath106 mag arcsec@xmath6 ( top to bottom ) .",
    "the shaded region shows the approximate location of the galaxy population .",
    "the lines are contours of constant volume for that @xmath107 . as the limiting isophote becomes brighter , the surface brightness dependency of the malmquist bias increases .    given the observed distribution , each galaxy within each bin is then randomly assigned a volume out to the maximum derived from visibility theory .",
    "this volume is converted to a redshift assuming an einstein - de sitter cosmology and a standard k - correction .",
    "we assume that the number density does not vary within the bin as a function of redshift , i.e. there is no evolution and no clustering .",
    "the exact absolute magnitude and surface brightness value is then randomly assigned within each bin , ( this assumes that the number density does not vary within the bin as a function of @xmath25 or @xmath108 ) . around the @xmath21 point",
    "particularly , this assumption fails , but a monte carlo simulation done at higher resolution finds no significant differences .",
    "the numbers in table 2 , and the plots in in fig  [ fig : ph_v_n]-  [ fig : lfs ] were produced from this monte carlo simulation .",
    "the net result is a magnitude - limited sample with objects randomly distributed within their allowed volume .",
    "we now calculate each galaxy s isophotal magnitude , a gaussian , and standard deviation , @xmath109 , to the light profile of the galaxy , such that the isophotal radius of the gaussian matches the isophotal radius of the galaxy and the isophotal magnitude of the gaussian is equivalent to the isophotal magnitude of the galaxy .",
    "the gaussian corrected magnitude is then the total flux under the gaussian .",

    "corrected magnitude and their total magnitude and sum the final number distribution according to absolute magnitude .",
    "this is plotted in fig  [ fig : n_m ] for total , corrected and isophotal absolute magnitudes .",
    "we then reconstruct the luminosity function using a @xmath110 prescription ( as our simulations contain no clustering this should be an optimal estimator ) .",
    "[ fig : lfs ] shows the recovered luminosity functions .",
    "the lfs of fig .",
    "[ fig : lfs ] demonstrate the impact of surface brightness selection as they are all drawn from the same bbf ; the only difference is the limiting isophote and the choice of magnitude measurement .",
    "the range of published values is shown as the shaded area ( excluding the lcrs lin et al .",
    "1996 ) . also shown is the limit solution , for our model bbf .",
    "the left panel assumes isophotal magnitudes are measured , the central panel assumes gaussian corrected magnitudes were used and the right panel assumes some procedure has been implemented to recover the total magnitudes .",
    "the results are also tabulated in table  [ table2 ] .      if isophotal magnitudes are adopted and the surface brightness limit is bright , the luminosities of galaxies are severely underestimated .",
    "thus both the number density and the @xmath21 value are severely underestimated ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "the variation in @xmath8 is upto 50% and in @xmath21 upto 1.0 mags .",
    "this tallies well with the range of schechter values recovered ( see  2 ) over the range tested ( @xmath111 ) . to some extent",
    "is it surprising that @xmath8 is not more drastically effected ; this is because the observed distribution of galaxies is skewed towards the faint end , see fig .",
    "[ fig : n_m ] . as",
    "a simple @xmath112 correction or maximum likelihood estimator based on the isophotal magnitudes alone does not take into account surface brightness issues , especially light loss , a smaller volume is calculated than for total magnitudes , leading to an overestimate of the number density , see fig  [ fig : v_m ] .",
    "this is tempered by a lower number density at brighter absolute magnitudes .",
    "perhaps most surprising is the robustness of the faint end slope whose value is recovered correctly regardless of the isophote .",
    "most surveys attempt to correct their isophotal magnitudes to total magnitudes .",
    "we used a gaussian correction as described above .",
    "[ fig : lfs ] and table  [ table2 ] demonstrate that corrected magnitudes recover 63% of the luminosity density at 24 mag arcsec@xmath6 compared to the 43% that isophotal magnitudes recover and the 98% that total magnitudes recover .",
    "as with isophotal magnitudes , corrected magnitudes give a luminosity function biased at all values of @xmath25 , although the bias has been significantly reduced .",
    "if some method is employed to correct the galaxies to total magnitudes ( e.g. kron magnitudes or petrosian magnitudes ) we find that the parameters are very robust for @xmath113 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",

    "fig  [ fig : v_m ] illustrates why this occurs .",
    "the volume has almost no surface brightness dependency for the thresholds @xmath115 provided @xmath116 , but it has significant surface brightness dependency for @xmath117 at @xmath114 .",
    "the bright absolute magnitudes are affected because of cosmological dimming and the k - correction .",
    "galaxies at the maximum redshift of @xmath118 will have an apparent surface brightness 3 mag arcsec@xmath6 fainter than their intrinsic surface brightness ( 1.7 mag arcsec@xmath6 due to cosmological dimming and 1.3 mag arcsec@xmath6 due to the k - correction , where @xmath119 ) .",
    "even galaxies at @xmath120 will be fainter by 1.6 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "thus a galaxy with central surface brightness of 21.5 mag arcsec@xmath6 ( @xmath121 mag arcsec@xmath6 ) and @xmath120 will not be detected with a threshold of @xmath122 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "recovering total magnitudes beforehand will give good estimators for the luminosity function , provided that significant numbers of galaxies are not missing .",

    "( 2001 ) that the faint - end slope depends more critically on the clustering correction than surface brightness issues .",

    "sdss calculated petrosian magnitudes before selecting their sample .",
    "petrosian magnitudes are aperture magnitudes and therefore do not show such a pronounced variation with redshift as isophotal magnitudes . thus the sample is selected from pseudo - total limits .    for deep isophotes ,",
    "the volume correction has virtually no surface brightness dependence , as shown in fig  [ fig : lfs ] , so the number density can be calculated at the bright end trivially and is only underestimated at the faint end where some galaxies have too a low surface brightness to get into the sample . using either of the techniques outlined in the previous paragraph ( cross et al .",

    "these are one source of mismatches between the estimates of @xmath10 in different surveys .",
    "another reason for different estimates is inhomogeneities in the space density of galaxies .",

    "dwarf galaxies are seen over a smaller volume , so they can have large clustering corrections .",

    "while our results broadly agree there are differences which may provide clues toward understanding formation and evolution tracks of different galaxy types .",
    "the bbf can be integrated to yield a total luminosity density of @xmath140mpc@xmath1 .",
    "this agrees with the luminosity density calculated from the data and demonstrates that unless the bbd shows sub - structure or a dramatic upturn beyond the selection boundaries the majority of the luminosity density in the local universe has now been detected .",
    "this paper has dealt with the biases that occur if you start with an isophotally selected sample and do not apply any corrections , or apply a light loss correction without properly considering the volume correction . in both cases",
    "the schechter parameters can be biased , and the luminosity density underestimated .    using a bbf",
    "we explore the impact of the limiting detection isophote on classical measures of the schechter function .",
    "we demonstrate that if isophotal magnitudes are used then errors of @xmath14 mags , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are likely at @xmath17 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "if gaussian corrected magnitudes are used these change to @xmath18 mags , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are likely at @xmath17 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "if total magnitudes can be recovered then the observed luminosity function will be correct within the errors provided @xmath141 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "hence while the faint - end slope , @xmath10 , appears fairly robust to surface brightness issues both the @xmath21 point and @xmath8 are highly dependent . the range over which these parameters vary is fully consistent with the scatter in the published values which come from a variety of surveys with differing selection criterion .",
    "these parameters produce a range in the luminosity density , @xmath142 , of @xmath143mpc@xmath1 again agreeing well with the range of published values ( @xmath144mpc@xmath1 see cross et al .",
    "2001 ) .    when selection effects are taken into account properly",
    ", the luminosity functions of recent surveys agree very well .",
    "the 2dfgrs and sdss luminosity functions give the same @xmath21 and @xmath8 values , but disagree on the values of @xmath10 .",
    "the differences in @xmath10 are likely to be due to a combination of input catalogue incompleteness , filter used and different clustering corrections .    ",
    "5 suggests that if a deep isophote is used and total magnitudes are recovered , then traditional magnitude dependent estimators can be used .",
    "however , future work at higher redshifts or low redshift work on extremely faint galaxies will include many galaxies close to the limits of the detection threshold , where surface brightness dependencies are strong .",
    "the bbd provides a framework that allows one to determine whether a bias is present ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : v_m ] ) and to correct for it .",
    "in addition , it produces parameters such as @xmath11 and @xmath13 which could be used to place constraints on galaxy formation and evolution models .",
    "our conclusion is that after a quarter of a century we need to upgrade our representation of the space - density of galaxies to now include surface brightness .",
    "the bbd and bbf provide an excellent starting point and should lead to more reliable and consistent measurements of the local luminosity density as well as providing new constraints on galaxy formation models .",

    "each is shown for 3 different redshifts , 0.05 , 0.1 and 0.15 .",
    "the corrected magnitudes are quite good with a typical offset of 0.1 mag and the greatest offset is 0.2 mag for an elliptical galaxy with a redshift of 0.1 or 0.15 and a @xmath147 lsbg , with a bulge - to - ratio of 0.12 .",
    "the isophotal magnitudes are much worse , with a typical offset of 0.4 mag and the greatest offset is 2.1 mag for the z=0.15 lsbg .",
    "there is only a weak redshift dependence for the corrected magnitudes .",
    "fig  [ fig : mu_bias ] shows the bias in effective surface brightness for our correction , before and after seeing .",
    "there is up to 1.75 mag arcsec@xmath6 offset before seeing is taken into account and up to 0.7 mag arcsec@xmath6 after seeing is taken into account .",
    "the greatest offsets occur in galaxies with large bulges , such as sa / s0s and ellipticals .",
    "the average offset will be around 0.4 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",
    "however , there is a significant bias in the effective surface brightnesses .",
    "ellipticals have their effective surface brightnesses underestimated by @xmath148 mag arcsec@xmath6 ; s0 and sa galaxies have their effective surface brightnesses overestimated by up to 0.5 mag arcsec@xmath6 .",

    "the error in the central surface surface brightness is the difference between the true central surface brightness and the calculated central surface brightness .",
    "the error in the effective surface brightness is exactly the same , as the difference between central and effective surface brightness is a constant for an exponential profile .",
    "the total magnitude calculated above is the same as the true total magnitude .",
    "thus the calculated effective surface brightnesses of late - type galaxies may be 0.48 mag too bright .",
    "however more complicated effects such as seeing , the thickness of the disk and internal extinction will all tend to reduce the measured surface brightness of edge on disks to a greater degree than face - on disks , reducing the mean offset .",
    "the overall effects of bulge - disk decomposition and inclination appear to be to make @xmath21 brighter by 0.1 mag and @xmath60 fainter by 0.55 mag arcsec@xmath6 , 0.5 mag arcsec@xmath6 for sas due to the bulge and 0.1 mag arcsec@xmath6 for sds due to the bulge and 0.5 mag arcsec@xmath6 due to inclination .",
    "it is difficult to be precise about this as the morphological mix of galaxies in the 2dfgrs is not known ."
