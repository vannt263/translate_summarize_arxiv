    "the mass function of individual compact objects ( brown dwarfs and planets ) in the galaxy remains poorly understood , particularly at the low - mass end .",
    "brown dwarfs ( bd ) are commonly defined as objects with masses between the deuterium and hydrogen burning limits ( dbl and hbl , respectively ) but these can be hard to detect , being intrinsically faint and fading further as they cool over time . below the dbl , the mass function for individual objects is even more poorly measured .",
    "unbound , free - floating objects of planetary mass have been discovered via direct imaging of clusters ( for example in @xmath11  orionis @xcite ) and in the field ( e.g. the 625@xmath10  object reported by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reported a population of planets which are either unbound or at very wide separations , discovered when their gravity caused short timescale microlensing events .",
    "at least partially as a result of these poor constraints the origin of low - mass compact objects remain unclear .",
    "although traditionally thought of as separate classes of objects , planets and brown dwarfs form a continuous scale of mass and are best distinguished by the circumstances of their formation @xcite .",
    "planets form in disks of material orbiting a protostellar object and may subsequently migrate to different period orbits .",
    "brown dwarfs on the other hand , are considered to be the extreme low mass end of the star formation process by fragmentation of locally over dense cores caused by turbulence in a cloud @xcite , which can themselves form protoplanetary disks @xcite .",
    "this mechanism may also produce objects of a few jupiter masses .",
    "for a recent review , see @xcite .",
    "the mass function of free - floating low - mass objects is likely to be different from those bound to stars .",
    "@xcite identified a paucity of bds orbiting close ( @xmath123au ) to their host stars , a region where jovian - mass planets are commonly found .",
    "this `` brown dwarf desert '' may represent the gap between the largest objects that can form in protoplanetary disks and the smallest objects that can concurrently collapse / condense next to a star .",
    "two different theories have been proposed to explain the formation of jovian planets in disks ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "the core accretion model predicts planets form from protoplanetary cores , growing up to tens of jupiter masses ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) but predicts few giant planets around m - dwarfs .",
    "higher mass stars are thought to have disks with enhanced surface densities which allow the cores to grow more rapidly @xcite , as do disks with a high fraction of dust , leading to enhanced planet formation around high metallicity stars @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the model of planet formation via gravitational instabilities in the disk ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) tends to favor the formation of more massive planets , in generally wider orbits .    a number of lines of evidence support the core accretion theory .",
    "there is a well - established correlation of increasing planet frequency with stellar metallicity @xcite .",
    "the results of radial velocity surveys imply there is a derth of m - dwarf stars with massive , close - in planets . in part , this reflects an observational bias against these faint objects but the sample is sufficiently large that a real statistical trend is emerging @xcite , for companions with @xmath13d .",
    "recent spectroscopic and _ kepler _ results have confirmed the prediction of a rapid increase in frequency for planets with small radii ( down to 2@xmath14 ) and @xmath15d for all spectral types , and found that these small planets are several times more common around stars of late spectral type @xcite .",
    "however , the core accretion model has difficulty forming massive planets at large orbital radii and such systems have been discovered , for example hr  8799 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a number of planets have been found orbiting m - dwarf hosts at larger orbital separations , for example @xcite .",
    "these systems may instead form through gravitational instability in the disk , which can account for companions up to several jupiter masses around m - dwarfs @xcite .    to better understand the formation mechanisms of heavy substellar companions in bound systems we need to trace the distributions of the physical and orbital properties ( such as mass ratio , orbital separation , occurrence frequency ) of a significant number of systems .",
    "yet relatively few bound brown dwarf companions have been reported , despite their being easy to detect at close orbital separations ( the `` brown dwarf desert '' ) .",
    "microlensing offers a complementary window onto bd and planet formation by probing for cooler companions of all masses in orbital radii between @xmath160.2  10au , separations which are difficult or time consuming to explore by other methods @xcite .",
    "it can probe the companion mass function down to m- and brown dwarf hosts , and is sensitive to companions from nearly equal mass down to terrestrial masses .",
    "sixteen systems have been published to date , and thanks to large - scale galactic lensing surveys and efficient follow - up , each season s bulge observing campaign is now producing a regular yield of new discoveries ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "of these 16 companions , 3 are giant planets orbiting m - dwarf stars : ogle-2005-blg-071 lb , a 3.8@xmath10  planet @xcite , moa-2009-blg-0387 lb , with @xmath17=2.5@xmath10  planet @xcite and moa-2011-blg-293 lb , which hosts a 2.4@xmath10  companion @xcite .    here",

    "[ sec : variability ]    moa-2010-blg-073 was present in the fields of the ogle - ii and ogle - iii surveys so the source star s i - band photometric record extends from 1998 to 2006 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : oglebaseline ] ) .",
    "ogle - iv was in the commissioning phase when this event took place . from this excellent baseline it was immediately clear that the source is variable over many - month time scales .",
    "this raised the possibility that shorter - term variability might obfuscate the microlensing signal , making it difficult to determine its properties .    to investigate this possibility",
    ", we performed a search for periodicities in the baseline ogle - ii and ogle - iii data , excluding the lensing event , using the anova algorithm @xcite . due to the seasonal gaps in the baseline , we analyzed the ogle - ii data in yearly subsets as it is the best sampled , searching for periods between @xmath31=0.5200d .",
    "as figure  [ fig : seasonalperiod ] demonstrates , there are no significant or persistent periodicities , other than the expected integer multiples of the 1-day sampling alias .",
    "we then combined the ogle - ii and iii data sets in order to search for periods up to @xmath31=4000d .",
    "figure  [ fig : oglebaseline ] indicates a slight ( @xmath160.04mag ) magnitude offset between the ogle - ii and iii data .",
    "this can occur as a residual of ogle s photometric calibration between the two surveys but it might also be the result of the intrinsic stellar variation .",
    "therefore , we performed a search for periods between 0.5 and 4000d based on the combined data both with and without this offset ( estimated visually ) . in both cases",
    "the periodogram was dominated by the window function ; the only significant power was found in the peaks marking multiples of the 1-day alias , plus one peak at extreme low frequency corresponding to the finite length of the data set .",
    "we conclude that this star is an irregular , long - term variable , most likely as a result of pulsations .",
    "however , there remained the possibility that the star could be irregularly variable on time scales comparable to that of the lensing event . to test this possibility , we binned the ogle - ii light curve on a range of time scales between 21200d . to each bin we fitted two functions : one of constant brightness , and one with a linear slope and calculated the weighted root - mean - square ( rms ) photometric scatter around each function per bin .",
    "we plot the average and maximum rms ( calculated over all bins in the lightcurve ) against the width of the bins in time in figure  [ fig : rmsvstime ] . on time",
    "scales shorter than 200d the rms scatter in the binned light curve is reasonably constant implying no significant short term variability .",
    "the longer term trend becomes clearly evident in the constant brightness curves for time scales longer than 400d .",
    "we note that for bin widths between @xmath168001200d , this curve has an rms actually exceeding that of the whole light curve ; this is because these bins were sufficiently wide that the first bin included the majority of the data , and the most variable sections of the light curve .",
    "as the bin widths became longer , they included more data points from the relatively stable section towards the end of the ogle - ii data set , and the rms drops .",
    "the deviation of the ogle lightcurve from a constant brightness exceeds 3@xmath11 for timescales longer than @xmath16750d .",
    "however , it deviates from a linear slope by @xmath321.6@xmath11 for timescales less than 1000d , so we represent this variation as a gradient in the lightcurve over the duration of the event .    the most intuitive way to account for the variation of the source was to measure the gradient of the lightcurve taken at baseline immediately before and after the event .",
    "unfortuantely only one of the available datasets covered these periods .",
    "fitting a straight - line model ( via a non - linear least - squares marquardt - levenberg algorithm ) to the moa 2009 and 2011 season data , we measured a slope of 0.018mag / yr . however , the rms scatter in the residuals of this fit were 0.016mag , making it difficult to properly determine the slope .",
    "additionally , in order to remove this slope from the other datasets , it would be necessary to transform the fluxes measured by each telescope on to the same scale as the moa data .",
    "we attempted this via a linear regression approach but found that significant residuals remained .",
    "these contributed to overall higher @xmath33  values when the corrected data were fit with binary lensing models .",
    "we therefore adopted the alternative method of incorporating the slope as an additional parameter in our lensing model which we fit to the original , uncorrected data and we describe this approach in the following sections .",
    "[ sec : analysis ]    in the analysis of this event , we used the established modeling software developed by s.  dong and c.  han @xcite .      as a starting point for our analysis , we needed approximate values for the three parameters of the standard model for a pspl event ( not yet including the slope ; this is discussed in  [ sec : slope ] ) : @xmath34 , the time of peak magnification occurring at the closest projected separation between the lens and source , @xmath35  and the einstein radius crossing time , @xmath5 . following standard convention ,",
    "all distances are quoted in units of the angular einstein radius , @xmath36 , of the lens .    to estimate these parameters , we combined all available data sets into a single light curve using the following scaling to take account of the varying degrees of psf blending from different instruments :    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the measured flux of the target at time @xmath39 from data set @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the lensing magnification at that time",
    ", @xmath42@xmath43 is the flux of the source star and @xmath44@xmath43 represents the flux of all stars blended with the source in the data set .",
    "a regression fit was used to measure @xmath42  and @xmath44  for each data set , producing an aligned light curve .",
    "although the resulting parameter estimates are somewhat different from their ` true ' values due to the existence of the anomalous deviation on the light curve , they provided a starting point in parameter space .",
    "we note that two additional parameters can contribute to a pspl model .",
    "they are the lens parallax parameters @xmath45  and @xmath46  that account for the light curve deviation caused by the motion of the earth in its orbit over the course of the event .",
    "the vector microlens parallax , @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the einstein radius projected onto the observer plane and :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 represents the direction of lens motion relative to the source as a counter - clockwise angle , north through east .",
    "however , this is generally significant only for long ( @xmath16months ) time scale events , and was included at a later stage ( see section  [ sec : parallax ] ) .",
    "the sharp spike feature in the lightcurve is indicative of the source closely approaching or crossing a caustic . in these circumstances ,",
    "it can not be approximated by a point light source and must be treated as a disk of finite angular radius , @xmath51 , with wavelength - dependent limb - darkening .",
    "this is addressed within our software using the ray - shooting approach @xcite : the path of light rays is traced from the image plane back to the source , taking into account the bending of the trajectory according to the lens equation . if a ray is found to `` land '' within the radius of the source , its intensity is computed taking limb - darkening into account .",
    "we derived this from the linear limb darkening law :    @xmath52,\\ ] ]    where @xmath53 is the intensity of the source at radius @xmath54 from the center , relative to the central intensity @xmath55 in the same wavelength , @xmath56 , scaled by the coefficient @xmath57 .",
    "while more accurate limb darkening models are available , they are not commonly used in microlensing analyses due to the complexity introduced by combining data from many sources ( @xcite discussed this in more detail ) . the values of @xmath57 for each passband were calculated from the kurucz atlas9 stellar atmosphere models presented by @xcite using the method of @xcite . however , within the microlensing community and software , equation  [ eqn : ld1 ] more commonly follows the formalism derived by @xcite :    @xmath58,\\ ] ]    where @xmath59 is the total flux from the source in a given passband and @xmath54 is the angle between the line of sight to the observer and the normal to the stellar surface .",
    "the limb darkening coefficient , @xmath60 is related to @xmath57 by :    @xmath61    the values of @xmath57 and @xmath60 applied for each dataset are presented in table  [ tab : obstable ] .",
    "the lensing magnification is then computed as the ratio of the number of rays reaching the source plane relative to the number in the image plane .",
    "this approach is only required while the source is close to the caustic . at larger separations , the software employs a semi - analytic hexadecapole approximation to the finite source calculation to improve computation speeds @xcite .",
    "to model the light curve of a binary lens event , we introduced three additional parameters : @xmath62 , the ratio of the masses of the two bodies composing the lens where @xmath7  is the more massive component , @xmath63 , the projected separation of those masses and @xmath64 , the angle of the trajectory of the lensed source star , relative to the lens binary axis .",
    "the frame of reference was defined to be at rest with respect to the earth at time @xmath65 , which we took to be the time of caustic crossing at hjd=2455321.0 , estimated from the easily identifiable feature in the light curve ( following the notation of @xcite ) .    with seven variables in the model ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath5 , @xmath64 , @xmath63 , @xmath4 , @xmath51 ) ,",
    "a number of different lens / source configurations may produce similar light curves , so it was necessary to thoroughly explore a large area of parameter space in order to ensure all possible solutions are identified .",
    "we therefore constructed a grid of models , spanning set ranges in the values of the three variables upon which the overall @xmath33  of the fit depended most sensitively , @xmath63 , @xmath4  and @xmath64 .",
    "each node in this grid took fixed values of ( @xmath63,@xmath4,@xmath64 ) and used a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) approach @xcite to find the best fitting model by optimizing the other parameters . to improve efficiency ,",
    "a magnification map is generated by rayshooting for each point in the grid from which the model light curves used to compute the @xmath33  are drawn .",
    "the grid covered the following range : @xmath66 in steps of 0.012 , @xmath67 in steps of 0.05 and @xmath68 in steps of 0.6 .",
    "mapping out the @xmath33  for each node in this grid , we found a number of local minima .",
    "visual inspection of these models overlaid on the light curve demonstrated that some more closely followed the data than others .",
    "our first pass analysis included substantial baseline photometry before and after the event .",
    "this was not well fit by the models due to the variability of the source and hence the @xmath33  map gave a distorted view of regions in parameter space that best match the event .",
    "for this reason , we proceeded by repeating the grid search using just data taken during 2010 .",
    "this produced two clear minima in @xmath33  of which one model stood out as by far the best match to the data .",
    "we then conducted a refined grid search over this restricted region of parameter space , taking smaller incremental steps .",
    "the refined grid search produced a reasonable model , fitting the majority of the data from all telescopes .",
    "this was used as a guide to identifying likely outlying data points , for which the quality of the reduction was then checked .",
    "a handful of data points were removed at this stage .",
    "however , this model included only fixed values for @xmath63 , @xmath4  and @xmath64 . to properly determine the standard binary model for this event , our next step was to allow the seven parameters ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath5 , @xmath64 , @xmath63 , @xmath4 , @xmath51 ) to be optimized during the mcmc fitting process , which used the grid search results as its starting point .",
    "at this point we included the extended baseline data from moa for seasons 2009 and 2011 , as these fall within the period for which the source s variability can be approximated with a straight line ; we address this in section  [ sec : slope ] .",
    "when fitting microlensing events , the reduced @xmath33  of the fit on a per data set basis , @xmath69 , typically produces a range of values both less than and exceeding the expected unity value .",
    "this can occur as different groups have slightly different ways of estimating photometric errors , but can lead to over- or under - emphasis being placed on particular data sets during the modeling process . + a common technique to address this issue is to arrive at a complete model for the event and then use this model to renormalize the original photometric errors of each data set , @xmath70 , according to the expression :    @xmath71    we first conducted the sequence of models described in the following sections in order to find the best model for the event .",
    "we then set the coefficients @xmath72 , @xmath73 such that the @xmath69  relative to that model equaled unity ; the adopted values are given in table  [ tab : obstable ] .",
    "we then repeated our mcmc fitting process , starting with the standard binary model and systematically adding parameters in to determine the extent of improvement in the model @xmath33  in each case .",
    "we compare models in tables  [ tab : chisqtable ] & [ tab : measuredpars ] , and we plot the residuals ( @xmath74 ) in figure  [ fig : finallc ] . in the following sections , the @xmath33  values given are those post - renormalization .",
    "+      [ sec : parallax ]    given that the event s @xmath5@xmath1644d@xmath160.12yr , it was necessary to include parallax in our model . using the parameters of the standard binary model as a starting point , we allowed our fitting process to optimize for @xmath46 , @xmath45also .",
    "we found that this significantly reduced the @xmath33  of the overall fit to 6064.773 . by default , this procedure explored models with positive projected separations at closest approach of the lens and source , that is @xmath75 , which we define as the source s trajectory passing the caustic at positive values of @xmath76 in the lens plane ( see figure  [ fig : caustic ] ) . for the standard model case the symmetry with respect to the binary axis of the caustic means that the @xmath77  solutions are identical .",
    "however once parallax was included , this was no longer the case , so we also explored @xmath77  solutions ( this degeneracy is further discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters of the @xmath75  model were taken as a starting point for the fit , except that the sign of @xmath35  was reversed and the @xmath64  value became @xmath78 .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the anomalous microlensing event , moa-2010-blg-073 , announced by the microlensing observations in astrophysics survey on 2010 - 03 - 18 . </S>",
    "<S> this event was remarkable because the source was previously known to be photometrically variable . analyzing the pre - event source lightcurve </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that it is an irregular variable over time scales @xmath0200d . </S>",
    "<S> its dereddened color , @xmath1 , is 1.221@xmath20.051mag and from our lens model we derive a source radius of 14.7@xmath21.3@xmath3 , suggesting that it is a red giant star . </S>",
    "<S> we initially explored a number of purely microlensing models for the event but found a residual gradient in the data taken prior to and after the event . </S>",
    "<S> this is likely to be due to the variability of the source rather than part of the lensing event , so we incorporated a slope parameter in our model in order to derive the true parameters of the lensing system . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the lensing system has a mass ratio of @xmath4=0.0654@xmath20.0006 . </S>",
    "<S> the einstein crossing time of the event , @xmath5=44.3@xmath20.1d , was sufficiently long that the lightcurve exhibited parallax effects . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the source trajectory relative to the large caustic structure allowed the orbital motion of the lens system to be detected . combining the parallax with the einstein radius , we were able to derive the distance to the lens , @xmath6=2.8@xmath20.4kpc , and the masses of the lensing objects . </S>",
    "<S> the primary of the lens is an m - dwarf with @xmath7=0.16@xmath20.03@xmath8  while the companion has @xmath9=11.0@xmath22.0@xmath10 , putting it in the boundary zone between planets and brown dwarfs . </S>"
