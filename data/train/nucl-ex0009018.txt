    "the concept of @xmath0-ray strength functions was introduced in the fundamental work of blatt and weisskopf @xcite .",
    "they showed that the square of the @xmath0-transition matrix element connecting highly excited states is proportional to the level spacing @xmath7 of the initial states @xmath8 with equal spin and parity .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the partial radiative width @xmath9 of the states @xmath8 ( which is connected to @xmath0 transitions with transition energy @xmath10 and populating some low lying levels ) and @xmath7 was suggested to be important for the description of @xmath0 transitions in the continuum . the corresponding model - independent definition of the @xmath0-ray strength function is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the multipolarity of the @xmath0 transition and x refers to the electric or magnetic character of the @xmath0 transition .",
    "the @xmath0-ray strength function is now considered as a measure for the average electromagnetic properties of nuclei and is fundamental for the understanding of nuclear structure and reactions involving @xmath0 rays .",
    "experimentally , the main information on the @xmath0-ray strength function has been obtained from the study of photoabsorption cross - sections @xcite .",
    "it is commonly adopted that the e1 strength function is determined by the properties of the giant electric dipole resonance ( gedr ) around its resonance energy , typically @xmath13",
    "1020  mev",
    ". however , serious lack of information persists at lower @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "it was assumed that the tail of the lorentzian describing the gedr determines the e1 strength function at these energies .",
    "the only experimental data on the e1 @xmath0-ray strength function between compound states with @xmath0-ray energies below 2  mev have been obtained using the @xmath14nd(n,@xmath15 reaction @xcite .",
    "these data show that the extrapolation of the gedr to low energies fails to describe the experimental values of the e1 strength function and indicates a finite value of @xmath16 in the limit @xmath17 . as a result",
    ", a model for the e1 strength function was developed by kadmenski , markushev and furman ( kmf ) @xcite which takes into account the energy and temperature dependence of the gedr width .",
    "today , this model and its empirical modifications @xcite are frequently used in the description of experimental data , but at the same time , it needs additional experimental verification .",
    "the e1 strength function is not solely governing the @xmath0-ray emission for lower @xmath0-ray energies .",
    "other multipolarities , and especially the m1 strength function , play important roles as well .",
    "the experimental information on the @xmath0-ray strength of m1 transitions is more scarce .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the m1 strength is well described by the weisskopf model @xcite , where the dipole @xmath0-ray strength function is independent of the @xmath0 energy .",
    "but some experiments indicate the existence of an m1 giant resonance originating from spin - flip excitations in the nucleus @xcite .",
    "also , the analysis of @xmath0-ray spectra from ( n,@xmath6 reactions @xcite indicates that the use of the m1 giant dipole resonance model gives a better fit to the experimental data than the weisskopf model .    special attention",
    "@xcite has been devoted to the anomalous bump found in the @xmath0-ray spectra of the ( n,@xmath6 and ( d , p@xmath6 reactions at low energies .",
    "the same bump has probably also been observed in the ( @xmath3he,@xmath4 ) reaction @xcite .",
    "a previous work @xcite shows that the energy of the @xmath0-ray bump increases with neutron number in the @xmath18  82126 region .",
    "the bump is called the pygmy resonance due to the considerably lower strength compared to the gedr .",
    "the pygmy resonance has first been explained by the enhancement of the e1 strength function @xcite .",
    "however , one can not rule out a possible m1 character connected to orbital m1 strength ( scissors mode ) in nuclei , which was first observed in electron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray strength function is difficult to measure in the @xmath0-decay between highly excited states , since the decay rate also depends on the number of accessible levels .",
    "the analysis of @xmath0-ray strength functions from the spectra of ( n,@xmath6 reactions @xcite shows that the results depend crucially on the level density model employed .",
    "therefore , conclusions based on a certain level density formula should be considered as preliminary and thus , need confirmation .",
    "recently @xcite , a new experimental technique has been developed , based on a set of primary @xmath0-ray spectra measured at consecutive excitation energies @xmath19 in light - ion reactions with one charged ejectile .",
    "the technique allows to disentangle the @xmath0-ray spectra into a @xmath0-energy dependent function @xmath20 ( which , as will be shown below , can be uniquely connected to the @xmath0-ray strength function ) and the level density @xmath21 .",
    "it makes it possible to study the @xmath0-ray strength function and level density independently from each other , in contrast to what can be done by using radiative neutron capture techniques . in previous works",
    "@xcite the extracted level densities @xmath22 have been utilized to deduce thermodynamical properties for several rare earth nuclei . in this paper , however , we will focus on the @xmath20 function .",
    "the experimental method is described in sect .",

    "iii we give a short outline of the models used to describe the experimental data , and in sect .",

    "conclusions are given in sect .",
    "the experiments were carried out with 45  mev @xmath3he - projectiles at the oslo cyclotron laboratory ( ocl ) .",
    "the particle-@xmath0 coincidences are measured with the cactus multidetector array @xcite using the ( @xmath3he,@xmath4 ) reaction on @xmath23dy and @xmath24yb self - supporting targets .",
    "the charged ejectiles were detected with eight particle telescopes placed at an angle of 45@xmath25 relative to the beam direction .",
    "an array of 28  nai @xmath0-ray detectors with a total efficiency of @xmath2615% of @xmath27 surrounded the target and particle detectors .    the experimental extraction procedure and",
    "the assumptions made are described in refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein . from the @xmath28-@xmath0-coincidences ,",
    "spectra of the total @xmath0-ray cascade can be sorted out according to the initial excitation energy @xmath19 .",
    "these spectra are the basis for making the first generation ( or primary ) @xmath0-ray matrix @xmath29 , which is factorized according to the brink - axel hypothesis @xcite @xmath30 here , @xmath31 and @xmath22 are the @xmath0-ray energy dependent factor and the level density , respectively .",
    "it is now possible to determine @xmath31 and @xmath22 by an iterative procedure . the first trial function for @xmath22 is simply taken as a straight line and the corresponding @xmath31 is determined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix ] ) .",
    "then , a @xmath32 minimum is calculated for each data point of @xmath31 and @xmath22 , keeping the others fixed .",
    "this procedure is repeated about 50  times , until a global least square fit to the @xmath261400 data points of the @xmath29 matrix is achieved .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that if one solution for @xmath31 and @xmath22 has been found , functions of the form @xmath33)\\\\ \\tilde{f}(e_\\gamma)&=&b\\,f(e_\\gamma)\\,\\exp(\\alpha\\,e_\\gamma ) \\label{eq : solut}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] give exactly the same fit to the @xmath29 matrix .",
    "the values of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath28 can be determined by additional conditions .",
    "the @xmath34 and @xmath28 parameters are used for absolute normalization of the level density @xmath22 : they are adjusted to reproduce ( _ i _ ) the number of levels observed in the vicinity of the ground state and ( _ ii _ ) the neutron resonance spacing at the neutron binding energy @xmath36 .",
    "further details on the extraction procedure and the simulation of errors are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following",
    "we will concentrate on the @xmath0-ray energy dependent function @xmath20 and its normalization .",
    "we assume that the main contributions to the derived @xmath31 function are from e1 and m1 @xmath0-transitions and that the accessible levels of positive and negative parity are equal in number for any energy and spin i.e. @xmath37 thus , the observed @xmath31 is expressed by a sum of the e1 and m1 @xmath0-ray strength functions only @xmath38 e_{\\gamma}^3 , \\label{eq : prim1}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the unknown normalization constant .",
    "our experiment does not provide the possibility to derive the absolute normalization of @xmath20 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : solut ] ) ) , therefore , the normalization constant has to be determined from other experimental data .",
    "the experimental , average total radiative width of neutron resonances @xmath39 at the neutron binding energy @xmath36 can e.g.  be written in terms of @xmath31 . to show this , we start with eq .",
    "( 3.1 ) of ref .",

    "furthermore , we have expressed @xmath22 as the product of the total level density , summed over all spins and the spin distribution @xmath51 .",
    "the spin distribution of the level density is given by @xcite @xmath52,\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the excitation - energy dependent spin cut - off parameter .",
    "the spin distribution is normalized to @xmath54 .",
    "the experimental value of the average total radiative width of neutron resonances @xmath39 is then the weighted sum of contributions with @xmath46 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) .",
    "because of methodical difficulties , the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 can not be determined experimentally in the interval @xmath55  mev and @xmath56  mev , respectively .",
    "in addition , the data at the highest @xmath0-ray energies , @xmath57  mev , suffer from poor statistics .",
    "therefore , extrapolations of @xmath31 and @xmath22 were necessary in order to calculate the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) .",
    "the contribution from the extrapolation to the total radiative width in eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) does not exceed 15% , thus the errors due to a possibly poor extrapolation are expected to be of minor importance .",
    "there have been developed several models for the @xmath0-ray strength functions @xmath58 .",
    "the theories behind the models are complicated , and will not be outlined here .",
    "however , the resulting strength functions can be written in simple analytical forms . in this work ,",
    "we have tested various e1 and m1 models . for e1 @xmath0-transitions",
    "these are :    * the standard giant electric dipole resonance ( gedr ) model based on the brink - axel approach @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the giant electric dipole resonance parameters derived from photoabsorption experiments .",

    "the energy and temperature dependent width of the gedr in this model is expressed by @xmath71 these expressions are developed in the framework of a collisional damping model for @xmath72 and although they should hold for @xmath73  mev , the absence of thermal shape fluctuations in the model limits their validity to @xmath74  mev .    for deformed nuclei ,",
    "the giant dipole resonance is split into two components , hence the sum of two strength functions with different gedr parameters has been employed .    for m1 @xmath0-transitions",
    "we are testing :    * the adjusted single - particle model of weisskopf @xcite where @xmath75 is independent of @xmath10 and the absolute value of @xmath76 has been taken from @xmath77 systematics close to the neutron binding energy @xcite . *",

    "the @xmath0-ray strength function in this case is determined by @xmath78    in the following , we will compare these models to the experimental findings .",
    "figure [ fig : level ] shows the experimentally extracted @xmath0-ray energy dependent factor @xmath31 and the level density @xmath22 for @xmath1dy and @xmath2yb .",
    "these data are the very same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , except that the data of @xmath79yb have been retuned by adjusting the parameters @xmath34 and @xmath28 to fit the level density based on known discrete levels at low excitation energy .",
    "we recognize that the shape of the unnormalized @xmath31 functions are rather equal for neighboring isotopes indicating that @xmath31 is a slowly varying function of mass number .    in the extraction procedure",
    ", we have used @xmath0-ray spectra from excitation energy bins between 4 and 8  mev . this span in excitation",
    "energy corresponds to a temperature region of 0.5 to 0.7  mev for the initial states , and 0.4 to 0.6  mev for the final states .",
    "the spin window in the pick - up reaction is @xmath80 , which is assumed to be approximately equal for initial and final states .",

    "figure [ fig : norm ] also shows that the lorentzian e1 model [ label a ) , eq .",
    "( [ eq : lorentz ] ) ] gives an acceptable description for @xmath0-ray energies near @xmath36 , in accordance with the systematics of kopecky and uhl for deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "but for lower energies this gedr model overestimates the experimental data .",
    "the combination of the kmf e1 model and the weisskopf m1 model [ label b ) ] fails to describe the data due to the strong m1 component especially in the region of low @xmath0-ray energies .",

    "( [ eq : kad ] , [ eq : m1 ] ) ] is seen to give the best description of the general slope of the @xmath0-ray strength function .",

    "the slopes of the calculated curves differ somewhat from the experimental ones .    in oder to obtain a good parameterization of the @xmath0-ray strength function which can fit the experimental data , the sum of the kmf e1 and the lorentzian m1 models has been selected for further modification .",
    "in contrast to the common use , where the nuclear temperature is defined as @xmath68 , we will keep the temperature fixed ( as first proposed by grudzevich @xcite ) according to a constant temperature model of the nuclear level density , which is supported by recent findings @xcite .",
    "the constant temperature model may also be regarded as to mimic the generalized superfluid model of the nuclear level density @xcite in this excitation energy region .",
    "the mean value of the temperature in the excitation energy region under study is @xmath81  mev for the final levels as has been mentioned above .",
    "we should point out that the temperature dependence of the gedr width used in the e1 model is a much disputed topic .",
    "experimental data on damping of the gedr at low temperatures ( @xmath74  mev ) are absent . at higher temperatures , the damping of the gedr",
    "is intensively studied with inelastic scattering of light particles ( e.g.@xmath28 particles @xcite ) but different theoretical approaches give ambiguous results .",
    "for example , in the adiabatic coupling model @xcite the increasing width is explained in terms of thermally induced shape fluctuations , yielding in general a @xmath90 dependence .",
    "these shape fluctuations become important for @xmath91  mev . in the collisional damping model",
    "@xcite the width of the gedr is due to collisional damping of nucleons , giving a @xmath92 law .",
    "experiments on @xmath93pb show that the data set can be fitted by both of these parameterizations @xcite , while new calculations on the collisional damping model using realistic in - medium cross - sections @xcite show that the width is in general underestimated within this model .",
    "also , a recent calculation @xcite on @xmath94sn within the phonon damping model shows good agreement with experiment .    at temperatures appropriate for the present study ( @xmath81  mev ) ,",
    "pairing correlations @xcite and shell effects @xcite have to be taken into account .",
    "most experimental data on the strength function at the low - energetic tale of the gedr are obtained from ( @xmath95 ) reactions , where the quadratic temperature - dependence of the gedr width @xcite is a popular parameterization @xcite .",
    "we therefore use this parameterization , knowing that the model behind can not account properly for the damping mechanism of the gedr @xcite .    in order to obtain a good fit of",
    "the chosen @xmath0-ray strength - function models to the data we use the temperature as a free parameter because of the uncertain temperature dependence of the gedr width in our temperature region .",
    "also , a common normalization constant @xmath96 was introduced as a free parameter .",
    "additionally , in order to fit the experimental data in the low - energy region , a lorentzian @xmath97 with three free parameters @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 has been used for describing the pygmy resonance . hence , the fitting function consists of the sum @xmath101 where @xmath16 and @xmath102 are given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kad ] ) and ( [ eq : m1 ] ) with parameters from systematics ( see table [ tab : param ] ) . the values of the fitting parameters for the pygmy resonance , the normalization constant @xmath96 and the temperature @xmath67 are quoted in table [ tab : fit ] .",
    "the resulting curves are shown as solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : norm ] .",
    "the agreement with experiment is excellent .",
    "it can of course be debated that other models for the @xmath0-ray strength functions can be fitted to the experimental data by letting a sufficient number of parameters free for fitting .",
    "we have chosen the sum of the kmf e1 and the lorentzian m1 models with one fit parameter ( @xmath67 ) and one free overall normalization constant ( @xmath96 ) in order to obtain a simple parameterization of the experimental data for further applications .",
    "in addition this parameterization is convenient to extract the parameters of the pygmy resonance experimentally .    to judge the relevance of the adopted model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fitfunc ] ) , it is important to discuss the fitting values obtained .",
    "table [ tab : fit ] shows that the coefficient @xmath96 is close to 1.0 for all four nuclei .",
    "this means that the adopted model reproduces the absolute values of the @xmath0-ray strength functions .",
    "the small deviation of @xmath96 from 1.0 can be explained e.g.  by uncertain values of the gedr parameters for the investigated nuclei , or they can be ascribed uncertainties in the experimental normalization of the @xmath0-ray strength functions .",
    "a close inspection of the fitting of eq .  ( [ eq : fitfunc ] ) to the data shows that the parameter @xmath67 is mainly determined by the experimental value of the @xmath0-ray strength function in a small @xmath0-energy region around 1.5  mev .",
    "the fitted values for the nuclear temperature are found around @xmath103 mev , a value which is consistent for all four nuclei within the fitting errors .",
    "however , the value is lower than expected from other studies @xcite , giving @xmath81  mev .",
    "since the temperature dependence of the gedr is only roughly determined by theory , we therefore interpret @xmath67 as a fit parameter not necessarily equal to the nuclear temperature .",
    "it is interesting to compare the pygmy resonance parameters to those obtained from ( n,@xmath6 experiments .",
