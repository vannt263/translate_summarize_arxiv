    "in the last years the possibility of the existence and the properties of a narrow dibaryon @xmath8 have been widely discussed both from the experimental and theoretical points of views @xcite - @xcite .",

    "the peaks in the forward dce reaction cross sections at the incident kinetic energy of pions @xmath11 mev are well described assuming that the dominant contribution of this process stems from a @xmath12 dibaryon with a mass @xmath13 mev and a free decay width @xmath14 mev .",
    "the @xmath15 mechanism is presently the only one which allows to explain the observed narrow structures .",
    "it is therefore important to find an evidence for a @xmath15 dibaryon in other reactions . at celsius ( uppsala ) , the reaction @xmath16 was studied @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath17 invariant mass spectrum revealed a @xmath18 peak at @xmath19 .",
    "the reported data are , however , still preliminary .",
    "further plans to search for a @xmath12 dibaryon include proton - proton collisions and photo- and electro - production on deuterons .",
    "the existence of narrow dibaryon resonances has important consequences for physics of dense nuclear matter .",
    "when the density is increased beyond a critical value , the formation of a bose condensate of the dibaryons becomes energetically favourable .",

    "the two nucleons in the vertex ( [ vertex ] ) are in the relative @xmath36 state , so they are affected by the long - distance attraction resulting in a virtual pole and by the short - distance repulsion .",

    "the common scale of @xmath58 and @xmath60 remains in our method unfixed due to the unknown asymptotic behaviour of the nucleon scattering phase shifts at high energies .",

    "( [ siggam ] ) we obtain for the cross section @xmath84    in the reaction @xmath1 , the threshold energy is @xmath85 mev . at @xmath86 mev , and",
    "@xmath87 one obtains @xmath88b .",
    "the cross section ( [ sigma ] ) should be compared to the experimental data on the @xmath0 production in the @xmath16 reaction @xcite . at @xmath89 mev ,",

    "hence , we are forced to conclude that the constant form factor @xmath35 does not allow to calculate the cross section @xmath93 correctly from the width @xmath94 .",
    "thus , we need to introduce a form factor to suppress the @xmath31 vertex at high @xmath23 energies . one possible choice of the form factor is the following @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a cut - off mass .",

    "the number of the elementary @xmath23 scatterings is already at intermediate energies relatively large and thus the @xmath0 production rate is enhanced .",
    "the mean free path @xmath118 fm of a nucleon in a heavy nucleus is small as compared to the nuclear size .",
    "therefore a nucleon from the colliding nucleus undergoes several scatterings with nucleons from the target nucleus , loses its energy and finally can not produce a @xmath0 dibaryon ( @xmath119 ) anymore . a naive estimate of the number of the @xmath0 dibaryons per a single @xmath120 collision yields @xmath121 the @xmath0 production rate in symmetric and central heavy ion collisions",

    "we assume @xmath124 this number is an upper limit for the pion production rate in the central heavy ion collisions , which coincides roughly with the prediction of the so - called harris systematics @xcite at that energy .",
