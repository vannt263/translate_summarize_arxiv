    "hanbury brown and twiss experiments @xcite play a central role in investigating correlations between identical particles .",
    "the underlying idea to these experiments is that intensity fluctuations and their correlations are tightly linked to the quantum mechanical state of a system .",
    "the statistical properties of a beam of photons or atoms can be accessed in counting experiments .",
    "a famous example of how the statistics vary for different quantum states of light is the distinct difference of photon correlations in thermal light beams and laser beams @xcite .    for ideal bosonic atoms the same quantum statistical properties",
    "are expected as for the case of photons .",
    "first experiments investigating the second order correlation function of laser - cooled thermal atoms have already been undertaken several years ago and the bunching behavior could be observed @xcite .",
    "the availability of quantum degenerate atomic gases @xcite has added a new dimension since now even coherent states of matter can be investigated .",
    "recently , the second order correlation function @xmath0 of quantum degenerate atoms has been observed @xcite and the feasibility of studying hanbury brown and twiss correlations of atoms released from an optical lattice has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "moreover , atom - atom correlations have also been observed in the dissociation process of ultracold molecules @xcite .    the second order temporal correlation function of the stationary field @xmath1 @xmath2 reveals valuable information about the intensity noise and the two - particle correlations in the sample . in particular , for an atomic beam released from a bose - einstein condensate the correlation function",
    "was found to be equal to unity revealing the second order coherence of the atom beam @xcite .",
    "together with the measurement of first order coherence of this beam @xcite this showed that atomic beams extracted from a bose - einstein condensate indeed are the matter wave analogue of an optical laser .    in this manuscript",
    "we discuss the two - particle correlations of atoms in an atomic beam extracted from a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "we measure the conditional and the unconditional probabilities for atom detection which constitutes a complementary view on two - particle correlations as compared to an analysis of the second order correlation function .",
    "our experimental setup combines the techniques for the production of atomic bose - einstein condensates with single atom detection by means of an ultrahigh finesse optical cavity @xcite .",
    "we collect @xmath3 @xmath4rb atoms in a vapor cell magneto - optical trap which is loaded from a pulsed dispenser source .",
    "after polarization gradient cooling and optical pumping into the @xmath5 hyperfine ground state we magnetically transfer the atoms over a distance of 8 cm into a magnetic quic trap @xcite . in this magnetic trap we perform radio frequency induced evaporative cooling of the atomic cloud and obtain almost pure bose - einstein condensates of @xmath6 atoms .",
    "after evaporation we relax the confinement of the atoms to the final trapping frequencies @xmath7hz , where @xmath8 denotes the vertical axis .    for output coupling an atom laser beam we apply a weak continuous microwave field to locally spin flip atoms inside the bose - einstein condensate into the @xmath9 state .",
    "these atoms do not experience the magnetic trapping potential but are released from the trap and form a well collimated beam which propagates downwards due to gravity @xcite .",
    "the output coupling is performed near the center of the bose condensate for a duration of 500ms during which we extract about @xmath10 atoms .",
    "alternatively , we create a beam with pseudo - thermal correlations from a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "this is in close analogy to changing the coherence properties of a laser beam by means of a rotating ground glass disc @xcite . instead of applying a monochromatic microwave field for output coupling",
    "we use a broadband microwave field .",
    "we employ a white noise radio - frequency generator in combination with a quartz crystal band pass filter which sets the bandwidth @xmath11 of the noise .",
    "the filter operates at a frequency of a few mhz and the noise signal is subsequently mixed to a fixed frequency signal close to the hyperfine transition at 6.8ghz to match the output coupling frequency .    after propagating a distance of 36 mm",
    "the atoms enter the ultrahigh finesse optical cavity ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the cavity consists of two identical mirrors separated by 178@xmath12 m .",
    "their radius of curvature is 77.5 mm resulting in a gaussian tem@xmath13 mode with a waist of @xmath14 m .",
    "the coupling strength between a single rb atom and the cavity field is @xmath15mhz on the @xmath16 transition of the d@xmath17 line .",
    "the cavity has a finesse of @xmath18 and the decay rate of the cavity field is @xmath19mhz .",
    "the spontaneous decay rate of the atomic dipole moment is @xmath20mhz . since @xmath21",
    "we operate in the strong coupling regime of cavity qed .",
    "the cavity resonance frequency is stabilized by means of a far - detuned laser with a wavelength of 830 nm using a pound - drever - hall locking scheme .",
    "the cavity is probed by a weak , near resonant laser beam whose transmission is monitored by a single photon counting module .",
    "we find a shot - noise limited transmission of photons through the empty cavity .",
    "the presence of an atom inside the cavity results in a drop of the transmission . the intensity and the frequency of the detection laser",
    "are optimized to yield a maximum detection efficiency for the released atoms which is @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "this number is primarily limited by the size of the atom laser beam which exceeds the cavity mode cross section .",
    "the atoms enter the cavity with a velocity of 84cm / s .",
    "the resulting dead time of our detector of approximately 70@xmath12s is short compared to the time scale of the correlations , which allows us to perform hanbury brown and twiss type measurements with a single detector @xcite .",
    "we record the cavity transmission for the period of atom laser operation ( typically 0.5s ) and average the photon counting data over 20@xmath12s . using a peak detection routine we determine the arrival time of atoms in the cavity , requiring that the cavity transmission drops below the empty cavity value by at least four times the standard deviation of the photon shot noise .",
    "we first investigate the distribution function of the time intervals between successive atom counting events .",
    "this represents a `` start - stop '' measurement , where a time counter is triggered by an atom detection event and stopped by the next detection event @xcite . from the histogram of the measured time intervals we obtain the conditional probability @xmath23 of detecting the _ next _ atom a time @xmath24 later than an initial atom observed at @xmath25 .",
    "these exclusive pair correlations , for which we restrict ourselves to consecutive atom detection events , are distinguished from the non - exclusive pair correlations measured by the second order correlation function @xmath0 . there",
    "the pairwise time differences between _ all _ atoms are evaluated .    for an average count rate @xmath26 the conditional detection probability density for a coherent beam",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath27 in contrast , for a thermal state of bosons one finds @xcite @xmath28 for @xmath29 the thermal probability density is twice as large as the coherent probability density .",
    "this reflects the increased thermal fluctuations and the bunching behavior in pair correlations of bosonic particles .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we compare our data with this theory . for the pseudo - thermal atomic beam we have chosen a bandwidth of @xmath30hz and analyzed time intervals short compared to the coherence time @xmath31ms .",
    "we normalize the measured probability by the measured count rate @xmath32s@xmath33 and fit the result with the functions given in equation([eqn2 ] ) and equation([eqn3 ] ) allowing for some overall scaling factor . from the fits we obtain the average count rates @xmath34s@xmath33 and @xmath35s@xmath33 for the atom laser beam and the pseudo thermal beam , respectively , which compares well with the experimentally determined flux @xmath36 for both cases . for @xmath37",
    "we find that the data for the atom laser beam exceed @xmath38 by approximately @xmath39 .",
    "similarly , the results for the pseudo - thermal beam exceed @xmath40 by approximately @xmath41 .",
    "this could be attributed to the dead time of our detector  which is about 70@xmath42s @xcite  during which we can not detect a possible consecutive event .",
    "we estimate the probability for a second atom arriving within the dead - time of the detector to be 5@xmath43 for the atom laser beam and 10@xmath43 for atoms in the pseudo - thermal beam . with this probability a later atom",
    "might falsely be identified being consecutive to the initial event which overestimates the number of time intervals larger than the detector dead time . moreover ,",
    "the experimental count rate is underestimated by the same factor contributing also to the enhancement of the data above the theoretical expectation .",
    "next we study the unconditional probability of a single atom detection event .",
    "the unconditional probability assumes that the timer is started at a randomly chosen time and records the time to the next atom detection event . for a coherent beam of atoms the unconditional probability for a detection event",
    "@xmath44 is equal to the conditional probability investigated above @xcite @xmath45 this reflects the absence of any density correlations in a coherent atomic beam . for a thermal state one",
    "finds @xmath46 which for @xmath37 differs from the corresponding conditional probability by a factor of 2 .",
    "the physical reason for this difference lies in the bunching of thermal bosons , which enhances the detection probability only for two nearby events measured by the conditional probability .",
    "the unconditional probability measures a single particle property and does not reveal a bunching effect . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show our measurements of the atom detection probability for a randomly chosen initial start point and find good agreement with the theoretical prediction .",
    "similarly to the results for the conditional probability we observe that the experimental data for @xmath37 are larger than the theoretically expected result of @xmath47 by the same relative amount as in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "we attribute this again to the dead time of our detector as discussed above .",
    "the apparently better data quality of fig.[fig3 ] as compared to fig.[fig2 ] is due to the larger number of available time intervals for the unconditional probability .",
    "we have studied the interval distribution of atom detection in an atom laser beam and a pseudo thermal atomic beam .",
    "we have investigated both the conditional and the unconditional detection probability and find good agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "this complements the measurement of the second order correlation function of the atomic beams @xcite ."
