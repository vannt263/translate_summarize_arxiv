    "the next generation of sky surveys will provide reasonably accurate photometric redshift estimates , so there is considerable interest in the development of techniques which can use these noisy distance estimates to provide unbiased estimates of galaxy scaling relations .",
    "while there exist a number of methods for estimating photometric redshifts ( budavari 2009 and references therein ) , there are fewer for using these to estimate accurate redshift distributions ( padmanabhan et al . 2005 ; sheth 2007 ; lima et al . 2008",
    "; cunha et al . 2009 ) , the luminosity function ( sheth 2007 ) , or the joint luminosity - size , color - magnitude , etc . relations ( rossi & sheth 2008 ; christlein et al . 2009 ; rossi et al . 2010 ) .    ideally , the output from a photometric redshift estimator is a normalized likelihood function which gives the probability that the true redshift is @xmath0 given the observed colors ( i.e. bolzonella et al .",
    "2000 ; collister & lahav 2004 ; cunha et al .",
    "let @xmath1 denote this quantity ; it may be skewed , bimodal , or more generally it may assume any arbitrary shape .",
    "let @xmath2 denote the mean or the most probable value of this distribution ( it does not matter which , although some of the logic which follows is more transparent if @xmath2 denotes the mean ) . often , @xmath2 ( sometimes with an estimate of the uncertainty on its value ) is the only quantity which is available .",
    "therefore , in section  [ dndz ] we first consider how @xmath2 compares with the true redshift @xmath0 , and contrast the convolution and deconvolution methods for estimating @xmath3  while in section [ cfc ] we describe how to reconstruct the redshift distribution directly from colors .",
    "section  [ pdf ] shows what this implies if one wishes to use the full distribution @xmath1 .",
    "section  [ phil ] shows how to extend the logic to the luminosity function , and section  [ phix ] to scaling relations , again by contrasting the convolution and deconvolution methods , and showing what generalization of @xmath1 is required from the photometric redshift codes if one wishes to do this .",
    "a final section summarizes our results .    where necessary",
    ", we write the hubble constant as @xmath4 , and we assume a spatially flat cosmological model with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the present - day densities of matter and cosmological constant scaled to the critical density .",
    "in what follows , we will use spectroscopic and photometric redshifts from the sdss to illustrate some of our arguments .",
    "details of how the early - type galaxy sample was selected are in rossi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) ; the photo-@xmath0s for this sample are from csabai et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "suppose that the true redshifts @xmath0 are available for a subset of the objects ; for now , assume that the subset is a random subsample of the objects in a magnitude limited catalog .",
    "ideally , this subset would have the same geometry as the full survey , as cross - correlating the objects with spectra and those without allows the use of other methods ( e.g. caler et al .",
    "2009 ) . in practice",
    ", this may be difficult to achieve  and this is not required for the analysis which follows , provided that the photometric redshift estimator does not have spatially dependent biases ( e.g. , as a result of photometric calibrations varying across the survey ) .    for the objects with spectroscopic redshifts , one can study the joint distribution of @xmath2 and @xmath0",
    "( see figure [ pzzeta ] ) .",
    "typically , most photometric redshift codes are constructed to return @xmath8 .",
    "the codes which do so are sometimes said to be unbiased , but they are not perfect : the scatter around the unbiased mean is of order @xmath9 .",
    "this scatter , combined with the fact that @xmath8 means that @xmath10 : the fact that @xmath11 is _ guaranteed _ to be biased is not widely appreciated .",
    "however , we show below that it matters little whether @xmath12 or @xmath11 are unbiased  what matters is that the bias is accurately quantified .        in particular , if @xmath13 and @xmath3 denote the distribution of @xmath2 and @xmath0 values in the subset of the data where both @xmath0 and @xmath2 are available , then what matters is that @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are known .",
    "note that @xmath17 the algorithm in sheth ( 2007 ) assumes that @xmath14 , measured in the subset for which both @xmath0 and @xmath2 are available , also applies to the full sample for which @xmath0 is not available .",
    "since @xmath13 is measured in the full dataset , and @xmath14 is known , a deconvolution is then used to estimate the true @xmath3 .",
    "suppose , however , that one measured @xmath15 instead .",
    "then , because @xmath18 one could estimate the quantity on the left hand side by ` convolving ' the two measurables on the right hand side . for the data - subset in which both @xmath0 and @xmath2 are available ,",
    "this is correct by definition .",
    "clearly , to use this method on the larger dataset for which only @xmath2 is available , one must assume that @xmath15 in the subset from which it was measured remains accurate in the larger dataset .",
    "rossi et al . (",
    "2010 ) have shown that the deconvolution method accurately reconstructs the true @xmath3 distribution from @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ nzconv ] shows that the convolution approach also works well , even when only a random 5% of the full dataset is used to calibrate @xmath15  as displayed in figure [ pzzeta ] .",
    "thus , for the dataset in which both @xmath0 and @xmath2 are available , both the convolution and deconvolution approaches are valid , whether or not the means ( or , for that matter , the most probable values ) of @xmath15 and @xmath14 are unbiased , and however complicated ( skewed , multimodal ) the shape of these two distributions .",
    "this remains true in the larger dataset where only @xmath2 is known .",
    "however , whereas the convolution approach assumes that @xmath15 is the same in the calibration subset as in the full one , the deconvolution approach assumes that @xmath14 is the same .",
    "the integral in equation  ( [ nz ] ) is really a sum over all the objects in the photometric dataset , where each object with estimated @xmath2 contributes to @xmath3 with weight @xmath15 : @xmath19 now , recall that @xmath2 was the mean ( or most probable ) value of a distribution returned by a photometric redshift code . in cases where the observed colours @xmath20 map to a unique value of @xmath2 , then this sum over @xmath2 is really a sum over @xmath20 , and",
    "the expression above is really @xmath21 equation  ( [ npz|c ] ) is one of the key results of this paper .",
    "although we arrived at equation  ( [ npz|c ] ) by requiring the mapping @xmath22 be one - to - one ( as may be the case for , e.g. , lrgs ) , it is actually more general .",
    "this is because one can simply measure @xmath23 in the sample for which spectra are in hand , for the same reason that one could measure @xmath15 .",
    "in fact , @xmath23 is an easier measurement , since it does not depend on the output of a photo-@xmath0 code !",
    "the constraint on the mapping between @xmath20 and @xmath2 in the discussion above was simply to motivate the connection between photo-@xmath0 codes and the convolution method .",
    "once the connection has been made , however , there is no real reason to go through the intermediate step of estimating @xmath2 , since all photo-@xmath0 codes use the observed colors @xmath20 anyway . in this respect ,",
    "equation  ( [ npz|c ] ) is the more direct and natural expression to work with than is equation  ( [ npz|zeta ] ) .",
    "in particular , because @xmath23 is an observable , the convolution approach of equation  ( [ npz|c ] ) is independent of any photo-@xmath0 algorithm . of course",
    ", if this method is to work , then the subsample with spectral information _ must _ be able to provide an accurate estimate of @xmath23 .",
    "the convolution method of the previous subsection provides a simple way of illustrating how one should use the output from photo-@xmath0 codes that actually provide a properly calibrated probability distribution @xmath1 for each set of colors @xmath20 , to estimate @xmath3 .",
    "it also shows in what sense the codes should be ` unbiased ' .",
    "in particular , equation  ( [ npz|c ] ) suggests that one can estimate @xmath24 by summing over all the objects in the dataset , weighting each by its @xmath1 .",
    "this is because @xmath25 equation  ( [ nlz|c ] ) shows that if @xmath1 does not have the same shape as @xmath23 , then use of @xmath1 will lead to a bias ; this is the pernicious bias which must be reduced  whether or not @xmath26 equals the spectroscopic redshift is , in some sense , irrelevant .",
    "( in the case of a one - to - one mapping between @xmath20 and @xmath2 , @xmath26 is the same as the quantity @xmath11 which we discussed in the previous subsections . )",
    "satisfying @xmath27 is nontrivial .",
    "this is perhaps most easily seen by supposing that the template or training set consists of two galaxy types ( early- and late - types , say ) , for which the same observed colors are associated with two different redshifts . in this case , if the photo-@xmath0 algorithms are working well , then @xmath1 will be bimodal for at least some @xmath20 .",
    "however , if the sample of interest only contains lrgs , then @xmath23 may actually be unimodal . as a result ,",
    "@xmath28 unless proper priors on the templates are used , or care has been taken to insure that the training set is representative of the sample of interest .",
    "we can perform a similar analysis of the luminosity function . in this case ,",
    "the key is to recognize that , in a magnitude limited survey , the quantity which is most directly affected by the photometric redshift error is not the luminosity function @xmath29 itself , but the luminosity distribution @xmath30 ( sheth 2007 ) . in a spectroscopic survey , @xmath31 differs from @xmath29 because one sees the brightest objects to larger distances : @xmath32 is the largest comoving volume to which an object with absolute magnitude @xmath33 could be seen .",
    "if we use @xmath34 to denote the absolute magnitude estimated using the photometric redshift @xmath2 , and @xmath33 its correct value , then @xmath35 sheth ( 2007 ) describes a deconvolution algorithm for estimating @xmath31 given measurements of @xmath36 and the assumption that @xmath37 , measured in a subset for which both @xmath0 and @xmath2 ( hence both @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) are available , also applies to the full photometric survey .    following the discussion in the previous section",
    ", we could instead have measured @xmath38 , and then used the fact that @xmath39 to estimate the quantity on the left hand side by summing over the photometric catalog on the right hand side , weighting each object in it by @xmath38 ; note that this weight depends on @xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ mzmphoto ] shows @xmath37 and @xmath38 ; notice how broad they are , and how much more skewed and biased @xmath38 is than @xmath37 .",
    "nevertheless , rossi et al . (",
    "2010 ) have shown that the deconvolution algorithm produces good results .",
    "figure  [ nmconv ] shows that the convolution algorithm does as well",
    ".    one estimates @xmath29 by dividing @xmath31 by @xmath32 .",
    "since this weight is the same for all objects with the same @xmath33 , one could have added an additional weighting term to the sum above to get @xmath40 one might have written @xmath41 , so the expression above shows explicitly why the photometric errors should be thought of as affecting @xmath31 and not @xmath29 .    to make the connection to @xmath23 and",
    "then @xmath1 it is worth considering how one computes @xmath33 from @xmath0 given the observed colors @xmath20 .",
    "if there were no @xmath42-correction , then the luminosity in a given band would be determined from the observed apparent brightness by the square of the ( cosmology dependent ) luminosity distance ",
    "the colors are not necessary . in practice",
    "however , one must apply a @xmath42-correction ; this depends on the spectral type of the galaxy , and hence on its color . as a result , the mapping between @xmath43 and @xmath33 depends on @xmath0 and @xmath20 .",
    "but it is still true that both @xmath33 and @xmath0 are determined by @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , the spectroscopic subsample which was previously used to estimate @xmath23 also allows one to estimate @xmath44 .",
    "the quantity of interest in the previous section , @xmath23 , is simply the integral of @xmath44 over all @xmath33 .",
    "the quantity of interest here , @xmath45 , is the integral of @xmath44 over all @xmath0 .",
    "thus , equation  ( [ nm ] ) becomes @xmath46 where the second to last expression writes the integral of @xmath44 over all @xmath0 as @xmath45 , and the final one writes the integral explicitly as a sum over the objects in the catalog .",
    "the expression above is the convolution - type estimate of @xmath31 ; it does not require a photometric redshift code .",
    "however , in principle , a photometric redshift code could output @xmath47 : the quantity such codes currently output , @xmath1 , is the integral of @xmath47 over all @xmath33 .",
    "the relevant weighted sum becomes @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the integral of @xmath47 over all @xmath0 , the sum is over all the objects in the catalog , and the method only works if @xmath50 .",
    "note that the luminosity density ( in solar units ) can , therefore , be written as @xmath51 the second to last line shows that one requires the average of @xmath52 summed over the distribution @xmath38 ; this is easily computed from distributions like those shown in the bottom panel of figure  [ mzmphoto ] .",
    "the final expression writes this as a sum over the observed distribution of colors .",
    "although the previous section considered the luminosity function in a single band , it is clear that the photometric redshift codes could output @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a set of absolute luminosities ( typically , these will be those associated with the various band passes from which the colors @xmath20 were determined ) .",
    "hence , the color magnitude relation , which is really a statement about the joint distribution in two bands , can be estimated by @xmath55 galaxy scaling relations can be estimated similarly , if we simply interpret @xmath54 as being the vector of observables which can include sizes , etc .",
    "( not just luminosities ) . in principle , quantities other than colors ( e.g. , apparent magnitudes , surface brightness , axis ratios ) can play a role in the photometric redshift determination ; this can be incorporated into the formalism simply by using @xmath20 to now denote the full set of observables from which the redshift and other intrisic quantities @xmath54 were estimated .",
    "if one wishes to use the output from a photo-@xmath0 code , rather than from the spectroscopic subset , one would use @xmath56 having checked that , in the spectroscopic subset , @xmath57 .",
    "we showed how previous work on deconvolution algorithms for making unbiased reconstructions of galaxy distributions and scaling relations ( sheth 2007 ; rossi & sheth 2008 ; rossi et al . 2010 ) could be related to convolution - based methods .",
    "whereas deconvolution based methods require accurate knowledge of @xmath14 , the distribution of the photometric redshift @xmath2 given the true redshift @xmath0 , convolution based methods require accurate knowledge of @xmath15 . since @xmath2 is derived from photometry , this may more generally be written as @xmath23 , where @xmath20 is the vector of observed photometric parameters which were used to estimate the redshift . in both cases , @xmath23 and @xmath14",
    "are calibrated from a sample in which @xmath0 is known , and are then used in a larger sample where @xmath0 is not available .",
    "if the smaller training set has the same selection limits as the larger dataset ( e.g. , both have the same magnitude limit ) then both approaches are valid .",
    "we illustrated our arguments with measurements in the sdss ( figures  [ pzzeta][nmconv ] ) .",
    "we also showed what additional information must be output from photometric redshift codes if their results are to be used in a convolution - like approach to provide unbiased estimates of galaxy scaling relations .",
    "in particular , we argued that only if the redshift distribution output by a photo-@xmath0 algorithm , @xmath1 , has the same shape as @xmath23 , can the algorithm be said to be unbiased . only in this case its output ( available for the full sample ) can be used in place of @xmath23 ( which is typically available for a small subset ) . the safest way to accomplish",
    "this is for the training set to be a random subsample of the full dataset  and to then tune the algorithm so that @xmath27 . if the training set is not representative , then care must be taken to ensure that @xmath1 does not yield biased results .",
    "obtaining spectra is expensive , so the question arises as to whether or not there is a more efficient alternative to the random sample approach . for the convolution method , which requires @xmath23 , the answer is clearly ` yes ' .",
    "this is because some color combinations ( e.g. the red sequence ) might give rise to a narrow @xmath23 distribution , whereas others may result in broader distributions .",
    "since it will take fewer objects to accurately estimate the shape of a narrow @xmath23 distribution than a broad one , observational effort would be better placed in obtaining spectra for those objects which produce broad @xmath23 distributions . for the deconvolution approach , one would like to preferentially target those redshifts @xmath0 which produce broader @xmath14 distributions  for similar reasons .",
    "but , since @xmath0 is not known until the spectra are taken , this can not be done , so taking a random sample of the full dataset is the safest way to proceed .",
    "our methods permit accurate measurement of many scaling relations for which spectra were previously thought to be necessary ( e.g. the color - magnitude relation , the size - surface brightness relation , the photometric fundamental plane ) , so we hope that our work will permit photometric redshift surveys to provide more stringent constraints on galaxy formation models at a fraction of the cost of spectroscopic surveys .",
