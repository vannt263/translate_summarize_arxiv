    "within modern theoretical condensed matter physics , a very important role is played by wave - function(wf ) based methodologies @xcite . in particular ,",
    "in the realm of quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) techniques @xcite at zero temperature , accurate approximations of the ground state or of some excited states of the investigated system are crucial . for simulations of bose systems in their ground state , although projector ground state qmc methods have been shown to yield _",
    "exact_@xcite results regardless of the employed trial wave - function , an accurate choice of latter improves the efficiency of the algorithm and provides a deep insight into the behavior of the system@xcite . on the other hand , for excited states of bose systems and for fermi systems , the need of accurate wfs is a necessity stemming from the sign or phase problem @xcite . once given the hamiltonian of a physical system , a functional form for the many - body wave - function is typically guessed combining physical intuition and mathematical arguments based on the imaginary time evolution@xcite . in general , some parameters @xmath2 , usually called variational parameters , remain to be determined .",
    "one thus deals with a family of wfs :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 denotes the many - body configuration ( possibly including spins ) of the system .",
    "an extremely important issue concerns the development and implementation of efficient tools to find optimal parameters .",
    "this aim is pursued choosing a suitable _ cost function _ to be optimized , typically the expectation value of the hamiltonian , the _ energy _ :    @xmath5    or the _ energy variance _",
    "@xcite :    @xmath6    if the number of parameters is large , systematic procedures to find out the minimum have to be devised .",
    "one of the most widely employed scheme to alter the variational parameters is the _ correlated sampling _",
    "( cs ) method@xcite , in which a set of configurations distributed according to @xmath7 is generated , @xmath8 being the current parameter configuration . with the purpose of minimizing the _ energy _ , such configurations are used to estimate @xmath9 relying on the expression : @xmath10 where : @xmath11 the main advantage of the cs technique is that the sampling of @xmath7 for a single parameter configuration @xmath8 gives access to the value of the @xmath9 , in principle , for any parameter configuration @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath9 is then minimized with respect to @xmath12 computing the energy gradient within the forward difference approximation and updating @xmath12 with the levenberg - marquardt method @xcite .",
    "although minimization of @xmath9 using the cs method has often been successful , in some cases the procedure can exhibit a numerical instability@xcite : it is well known , in particular , that the cs method may give inaccurate results when the nodal surface of a many - fermion trial wave - function is allowed to change during the optimization process . in fact , unless the nodal surfaces of @xmath13 and @xmath14 coincide , massive fluctuations in the weights occur on configurations close to the zeros of @xmath7 , determining drastic statistical errors in the cs estimate of @xmath9 .",
    "more recent optimization schemes@xcite require explicit calculations of derivatives of the form :    @xmath15    with the aim of minimizing and/or .    although are nothing but derivatives , their nave calculation and algorithmic implementation leads , especially in the case of non - linear parameters , to very computationally demanding optimization algorithms .",
    "it thus becomes necessary to devise non trivial strategies to keep the complexity of the calculations favorable . in the present work we focus on a very wide class of correlated many - body wave - functions , very important for condensed matter physics : the slater - jastrow - three - body - backflow ( sj3bbf ) wf .",
    "we show the possibility to compute , for a given variational parameter , performing analytical derivatives , using at most @xmath16 operations , @xmath1 being the number of particles .",
    "we provide a practical and fully detailed implementation of the linear method ( lm ) , first conceived by nightingale and melik - alaverdian @xcite and later generalized by toulouse and umrigar @xcite and umrigar et al .",
    "@xcite to the treatment of non - linear parameters . in this paper",
    "we do not address the topic of the scaling of the calculations with respect to the number of variational parameters @xmath17 , which is discussed for example in the very interesting paper @xcite",
    "in order to keep a simple notation , we briefly describe here the lm in the case of real - valued wave - functions . the non trivial generalization to the case of complex - valued wfs",
    "is presented in [ appb ] . within the lm , the optimization of the _ energy _ is pursued by iteratively :    1 .",
    "expanding the normalized wf : @xmath18 around the current parameter configuration @xmath8 to first order in the parameter variation @xmath19 : @xmath20 with @xmath21 and : + @xmath22 + where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "+ the normalization constraint : @xmath25 results in the orthogonality between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "2 .   minimizing the expectation value of the hamiltonian operator @xmath28 over the wf : @xmath29 with respect to the parameter variation @xmath30 . inserting into leads to : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the current value of the energy , @xmath33",
    "is related to the gradient of the energy by the following equality : @xmath34 which is easily derived computing @xmath35 and recalling , and @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , @xmath37 . in published literature , the matrices appearing at the numerator and denominator of are referred to , respectively , as _ energy _ and _ overlap _ matrices @xcite .",
    "3 .   choosing the parameter variation @xmath38 in such a way to minimize .",
    "the global minimum of is necessarily a stationary point , where @xmath39 ; the stationarity condition translates into the following generalized eigenvalue equation@xcite : @xmath40 there are @xmath41 possible parameter variations @xmath42 , @xmath17 being the number of parameters , corresponding to properly rescaled solutions @xmath43 of the generalized eigenvalue equation with eigenvalues @xmath44 .",
    "such parameter variations are stationary points of the energy expectation . moreover ,",
    "inserting @xmath45 in and recalling leads to : @xmath46 clearly implying that the global minimum of the energy expectation corresponds to the solution of relative to the lowest eigenvalue .",
    "it is worth noticing that , for large parameter variations @xmath45 , the expanded wf might not be an accurate approximation for the actual normalized wf .",
    "this could induce to unphysically low eigenvalues @xmath47 , that should be regarded to as unreliable estimates for the energy functional and rejected .",
    "the elements of the energy and overlap matrices are estimated in variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculations . introducing the symbol @xmath48 to denote the average : @xmath49 of @xmath50 over",
    "the probability distribution @xmath51 evaluated using a large number of monte carlo configurations drawn from @xmath52 .",
    "it is readily found that :    @xmath53    and that : @xmath54 where the symbols @xmath55 and @xmath56 have been introduced .",
    "the estimators , are written in form of covariances rather than mean values of products to highlight their adequateness to numerical simulation , as it is a well known circumstance@xcite that fluctuations of covariances are typically smaller than those of products .",
    "the estimators for the elements @xmath57 of the energy matrix are not symmetric in @xmath58 and @xmath59 when approximated by averages over finite monte carlo samples , whereas @xmath60 itself is of course symmetric .",
    "the hermiticity of the energy matrix is not exploited to symmetrize the estimator since , as discussed in @xcite , using a non - symmetric estimator results in considerably smaller fluctuations in the parameter variations than using its symmetrized analog .",
    "we remark that , despite the solution of a non - symmetric eigenvalue equation can lead to complex eigenvalues , it turns out @xcite that parameter variations @xmath61 corresponding to wave - functions @xmath62 having large overlap with the current wave - function @xmath63 correspond to eigenvalues with small imaginary part .",
    "moreover , the leading divergences in near the nodal surface of @xmath64 , contained in the terms @xmath65 and @xmath66 , cancel exactly @xcite , granting the adequateness of the linear method to the optimization of fermionic wave - functions .",
    "the choice is very natural but not unique .",
    "in fact , a differently normalized wave - function : @xmath67 has the first - order expansion : @xmath68 under the condition that @xmath69 , with : @xmath70 the expansions and lie in the subspace of the hilbert space spanned by the current wave - function @xmath71 and its derivatives @xmath72 , implying that the parameter variations @xmath73 and @xmath74 corresponding to the energy minimum are proportional @xcite : @xmath75 the derivatives @xmath76 of the normalization function should be adjusted in such a way as to improve the performance of the algorithm . the empirical evidence that a good choice for nonlinear parameters is represented by : @xmath77 has been signaled in literature@xcite .",
    "the constant @xmath78 $ ] there appearing is meant to be adjusted by hand during each iteration so that , to gain insight into the rationale behind its choice , it is worth inserting into obtaining : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is a positive quantity , the overlap matrix being positive - definite since : @xmath81 in the light of this observation , the denominator appearing at the right member of is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath82 ranging from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , so that smaller values of @xmath82 decreases the parameter variations .",
    "we remark that in some cases the choice @xmath85 can result in excessively large parameter variations that must be rejected ; the safer choice @xmath86 , on the other hand , can lead to excessively small parameter variations that slow down the convergence of the algorithm .",
    "the choice @xmath87 typically represents a good compromise between these two competing effects .",
    "if the current parameter configuration @xmath8 is not sufficiently close to the minimum for the quadratic approximation of the energy to hold , or if the number of vmc samples employed to estimate the elements of the energy and overlap matrices is too small , and the latter are insufficiently accurate , the parameter variations @xmath45 proposed by the lm may give rise to worse updated wave - functions .",
    "in such situation , it is convenient to apply a tikhonov regularization @xcite to the energy matrix by making the substitution : @xmath88 @xmath89 being a real positive number , for large values of which the parameter variations @xmath90 are easily shown to either diverge as @xmath91 , @xmath92 being solution of the nonlinear system @xmath93 , or vanish as @xmath94 , being @xmath95 . therefore , vanishing parameter variations rotate from their original direction to the steepest descent direction in a nontrivial way .",
    "the parameter @xmath96 is meant to be adjusted by hand before each iteration .",
    "the criterion of choice is discussed in @xcite : for several values of @xmath89 , the parameter variation associated to the lowest physically reasonable eigenvalue is used as an input to a vmc calculation ; then , either the value of @xmath89 yielding the lowest vmc energy is chosen , or an interpolation is carried out to identify the best value of @xmath89 .",
    "typical calculations in condensed matter physics involve wave - functions containing two - body and three - body correlations for bose systems @xcite , and backflow correlations for fermi systems @xcite . in the case of fermi system such trial wfs are not positive definite ; nevertheless , it is well known @xcite that in vmc calculations the monte carlo sampling can be restricted , without introducing any bias , to subsets of the configuration space where the sign of the trial wave - function is fixed , for instance positive . within such regions",
    "the trial wave - function can always be written in the form : @xmath97 where the upper line refers to bosons while the lower line to fermions .",
    "explicitly , the two - body , three - body and backflow correlations have , quite generally , the following form : @xmath98 where the notation @xmath99 is used to separate the variational parameters into subsets related to distinct wf parts . in @xmath100 and : @xmath101 for some parameter - dependent radial functions @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 . the vmc estimators for the energy and overlap matrices contain the quantities , also occurring in the framework of other optimization techniques @xcite , of which a completely explicit and numerically efficient expression will be now detailed .    first , we immediately observe that : @xmath105 is a sum of contributions , each of which is associated to a specific part of the wave - function .",
    "moreover : @xmath106 and since : @xmath107 merging and yields : @xmath108 equations and pinpoint the need of computing the quantities @xmath109 , @xmath110 and @xmath111 in order to construct the vmc estimators of the energy and overlap matrices .",
    "we remark that , as the logarithm @xmath112 of the trial wf is additive in the terms associated to the many - body correlations it encompasses , its derivatives with respect to the variational parameters can be treated separately . in the forthcoming calculations , for",
    "all parameter - dependent radial functions @xmath113 the notation @xmath114 will be employed to indicate the @xmath58-th radial derivative of @xmath115 . moreover",
    ", the symbol @xmath116 will be used as a shortcut for @xmath117 with @xmath118 , @xmath119 being the dimensionality of the system .      the contribution to the quantity",
