    "the transition - metal perovskite oxides @xmath2o@xmath1 ( with @xmath3@xmath4 y , la , or other trivalent rare - earth ion , and @xmath5@xmath4 ti or v ) are regarded as some of the key materials for understanding the strong coupling among spin , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom in correlated electron systems.@xcite    according to the electronic structure calculations in the local - density approximation ( lda ) , all these compounds can be classified as `` @xmath0 systems '' , as all of them have a common transition - metal @xmath0-band , located near the fermi level , which is well separated from the oxygen-@xmath6 band and a hybrid transition - metal @xmath7 and either y(@xmath8 ) or la(@xmath9 ) band , located correspondingly in the lower- and upper - part of the spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig.dossummary ] ) .",
    "the number of electrons that are donated by each ti and v site into the @xmath0-band is correspondingly one and two .",
    "these electrons are subjected to the strong intraatomic coulomb repulsion , which is not properly treated by lda and requires some considerable improvement of this approximation , which currently processes in the direction of merging lda with various model approaches for the strongly - correlated systems.@xcite nevertheless , lda continues play an important role for these systems as it naturally incorporates into the model analysis the effects of the lattice distortion , and does it formally without any adjustable parameters .",
    "although the origin of the lattice distortion in the @xmath0 perovskite oxides is not fully understood , is is definitely strong and exhibits an appreciable material - dependence , which can be seen even visually in fig .",
    "[ fig.structure ] .",
    "the interplay of this lattice distortion with the coulomb correlations seems to be the key factor for understanding the large variation of the magnetic properties among the @xmath0 perovskite oxides .",
    "the difference exists not only between ti- and v - based compounds , but also within each group of formally isovalent materials , depending on whether it is composed of the y or la atoms .",
    "the latter seems to be a clear experimental manifestation of the distortion effect , which is related with the difference of the ionic radii of y and la .",
    "all together this leads to the famous phase diagram of the distorted @xmath0 perovskite oxides , where each material exhibits quite a distinct magnetic behavior : ytio@xmath1 is a ferromagnet;@xcite latio@xmath1 is a three - dimensional ( g - type ) antiferromagnet;@xcite yvo@xmath1 has the low - temperature g - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase , which at around @xmath10 k transforms into a chain - like ( c - type ) antiferromagnetic phase;@xcite and lavo@xmath1 is the c - type antiferromagnet.@xcite    on the theoretical side , the large variety of these magnetic phases has been intensively studied using model approaches ( refs .  ) as well as the first - principles electronic structure calculations ( refs .  ) .",
    "the problem is still far from being understood , and remains to be the subject of numerous contradictions and debates .",
    "surprisingly that at present there is no clear consensus not only between model and first - principles electronic structure communities , but also between researchers working in each of these groups . presumably , the most striking example is latio@xmath1 , where in order to explain the experimentally observed g - type afm ground state , two different models , which practically exclude each other , have been proposed .",
    "one is the model of orbital liquid , _ which implies the degeneracy of the atomic @xmath0 levels in the crystalline environment_.@xcite another model is based on the theory of crystal - field ( cf ) splitting , _ which lifts the orbital degeneracy _ and leads to the one particular type the orbital ordering compatible with the g - type antiferromagnetism.@xcite the situation in the area of first - principles electronic structure calculations is controversial as well .",
    "although majority of the researchers now agree that in order to describe properly the electronic structure of @xmath0 perovskite oxides , one should go beyond the conventional lda and incorporate the effects of intraatomic coulomb correlations , this merging is typically done in a semi - empirical way , as it relies on a certain number of adjustable parameters , postulates , and the form of the basis functions used for the implementation of various corrections on the top of lda.@xcite there are also certain differences regarding both the definition and the approximations used for the cf splitting in the electronic structure calculations , which will be considered in details in sec .",
    "[ sec : kinetic ] .",
    "since the magnetic properties of @xmath0 perovskite oxides are extremely sensitive to all such details , it is not surprising that there is a substantial variation in the results of first - principles calculations , which sometimes yield even qualitatively different conclusions about the cf splitting and the magnetic structure of the distorted @xmath0 perovskite oxides.@xcite these discrepancies put forward a severe demand on the creation of a really parameter - free scheme of electronic structure calculations for the strongly - correlated systems .",
    "therefore , the main motivation of the present work is twofold .",
    "+ ( i ) in our previous work ( ref .  )",
    "we have proposed a method of construction of the effective hubbard - type model for the electronic states near the fermi level on the basis of first - principles electronic structure calculations . in the present work",
    "we apply this strategy to the @xmath0 states of the distorted perovskite oxides .",
    "namely , we will derive the parameters of the hubbard hamiltonian for the @xmath0 bands and solve this hamiltonian using several different techniques , including the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation , the perturbation theory for the correlation energy , and the the theory of superexchange interactions taking into account the effects of the multiplet structure of the atomic states .",
    "of course , our method is based on a number of approximation , which have been introduced in ref .   and will be briefly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize from the very beginning that our policy here is _ not to use any adjustable parameters _ apart from the approximations considered in ref .  .",
    "thus , we believe that it poses a severe test for the proposed method , and the obtained results should clearly demonstrate that our general strategy , which can be expressed by the formula _ first - principles electronic structure calculations _ @xmath11 _ construction of the model hamiltonian _",
    "@xmath11 _ solution of the model hamiltonian_,@xcite is indeed very promising .",
    "for example , at the hf level , using relatively simple model hamiltonian , which is limited exclusively by the @xmath0 bands , we will be able to reproduce the main results of all - electron calculations.@xcite furthermore , due to the simplicity of the model hamiltonian we can easily go beyond the hf approximation and include the correlation effects .",
    "+ ( ii ) why do we need to convert the results of first - principles electronic structure calculations into a model ?",
    "apart from the purely computational reason , related with the reduced dimensionality of the hilbert space for the solution of the many - electron problem,@xcite the story of distorted @xmath0 perovskite oxides clearly shows that the model consideration has yet another advantage , which is typically not sufficiently appreciated in the computational community .",
    "it is true that the field of first - principles electronic structure calculations is currently on the rise , and the calculation of the basic properties for many materials will soon become a matter of routine . however , the methods of electronic structure calculations are based on some approximations , the limitations of which should be clearly understood .",
    "furthermore , like the experiment data , the results of first - principles electronic structure calculations will always require some interpretation , which would transform the world of numbers and trends into a `` parallel world '' of rationalized model categories capturing the essence of the electronic structure calculations .",
    "the understanding of the results of calculations in terms of these categories opens a way , on the one hand , to the material engineering of compounds with a desired set of properties , and , on the other way , to `` engineering '' of the new methods of electronic structure calculations in the direction of elucidation and overcoming the existing approximations . in this work",
    "we will illustrate how the results of first - principles calculations for the distorted perovskite oxides can be interpreted in terms of a limited number of model parameters , such as the crystal - field splitting , transfer integrals , and the intraatomic coulomb interactions , which can be regarded as the basic operating blocks for understanding the properties of these materials as well as the limitation of approximations existing in the methods of electronic structure calculations .",
    "particularly , we will explicitly show that the atomic - spheres - approximation ( asa ) , which was employed in the series of publications ( refs .  ) , is not enough as it neglects the nonsphericity of the madelung potential .",
    "the latter plays an important role and in many cases predetermines the character of the magnetic ordering in the distorted @xmath0 perovskite oxides .",
    "we will also show that once the parameters of coulomb interactions are determined from the first principles , the commonly used mean - field hf approximation does not necessary guaranty the right answer for the magnetic properties of @xmath0 perovskite oxides .",
    "however , we will argue that this is a normal situation , and in the majority of cases , a better agreement with the experimental data can be obtained by systematically including the correlation effects beyond the hf approximation . in this sense ,",
    "our strategy is completely different from conventional lda@xmath12@xmath13 calculations , where the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath13 is typically treated as an adjustable parameter ( e.g. , refs .  ) . by changing @xmath13",
    ", one can certainly get a better numerical agreement with some experimental data already at the hf level .",
    "however , one should clearly understand that such an empirical treatment actually disguises the actual role played by the correlation effects in the narrow - band compounds .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : structure ] we will briefly remind the main details of the crystal and magnetic structure of the distorted perovskite oxides .",

    "particularly , in sec .  [",
    "sec : kinetic ] we will discuss highly controversial situation around the values of the cf splitting extracted from electronic structure calculations,@xcite and argue that the main difference is caused by two factors : ( i ) certain arbitrariness with the choice of the wannier functions for the @xmath0 bands of the distorted perovskite oxides ; ( ii ) additional approximations used for the nonspherical part of the crystalline potential inside atomic spheres .",

    "[ sec : method ] , and the results of calculations will be presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] we will summarize the main results of our work .",
    "the distorted perovskite oxides contain four formula units in the primitive cell . the transition - metal ( @xmath5 ) atoms are located at @xmath14 ( site 1 ) , @xmath15 ( site 2 ) , @xmath16 ( site 3 ) , and @xmath17 ( site 4 ) , in terms of three primitive translations : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ( see fig .  [ fig.structure ] ) .",
    "the distortion can be either orthorhombic or monoclinic .",
    "the space group of the orthorhombic phase is @xmath21 ( in the schnflies notations or @xmath22 in the hermann - maguin notations , no .  62 in the international tables ) .",
    "in this case all @xmath5-sites are equivalent and can be transformed to each other using symmetry operations of the @xmath21 group .",
    "the monoclinic phase has the space group @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , no .  14 in the international tables).@xcite in this case , there are two nonequivalent pairs of @xmath5-sites : ( 1,2 ) and ( 3,4 ) .",
    "each pair is allocated within the same @xmath25-plane , so that the atoms can be transformed to each other using symmetry operations of the @xmath23 group . however , there is no symmetry operation , which connects the atoms belonging to different @xmath25-planes .",
    "we use the experimental lattice parameters and the atomic positions reported in ref .   for ytio@xmath1 ( the data corresponds to the temperature t@xmath4@xmath26 k ) , in ref .   for latio@xmath1 ( t@xmath4@xmath27 k ) , in ref .   for yvo@xmath1 ( t@xmath4@xmath28 k and @xmath29 k , for the orthorhombic and monoclinic phase ,",
    "respectively ) , and in ref .   for lavo@xmath1 ( t@xmath4@xmath30 k ) .",
    "there are five possible magnetic structure , which can be obtained by associating with each transition - metal site either positive ( @xmath31 ) or negative ( @xmath32 ) direction of spin , without enlarging the unit cell .",
    "therefore , each magnetic structure can be denoted by means of four vectors associated with the transition - metal sites ( 1 2 3 4 ) .",

    "+ similar classification can be used the orbital ordering .",
    "typically , two orthogonal orbitals at the neighboring transition - metal sites are said to be ordered antiferromagnetically , although such a definition is not unique.@xcite",
    "our first goal is the construction of the effective multi - orbital hubbard model for the isolated @xmath0 bands : @xmath33 where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron in the wannier orbital @xmath36 of the site @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is a joint index , incorporating all remaining ( spin and orbital ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the matrix @xmath39@xmath40@xmath41 parameterizes the kinetic energy of electrons , where the site - diagonal part ( @xmath37@xmath4@xmath42 ) describes the local level - splitting , caused by the crystal field and ( or ) the spin - orbit interaction , and the off - diagonal part ( @xmath37@xmath43@xmath42 ) stands for the transfer integrals .",
    "@xmath44@xmath45@xmath46 are the matrix elements of _ screened _ coulomb interaction @xmath47@xmath45@xmath48 , which are supposed to be diagonal with respect to the site indices .    the parameters of the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ eqn : hmanybody ] ) can be derived `` from the first principles '' , starting from the electronic structure in lda .",
    "this procedure has been already discussed in details in ref .  .",
    "here we only remind the main ideas and present the results for the distorted perovskite compounds .",
    "all calculations have been performed using linear muffin - tin - orbital ( lmto ) method in the atomic - spheres - approximation.@xcite we have also considered the additional correction to the crystal - field splitting , coming from the nonsphericity of electron - ion interactions , beyond conventional asa.@xcite      the kinetic - energy part of the hubbard hamiltonian was constructed using the downfolding method.@xcite it yields certain set of parameters @xmath49 .",
    "the wannier functions @xmath50 for the the isolated @xmath0 bands can be formally reconstructed from @xmath49 using the definition @xmath51@xmath4@xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the lda hamiltonian in asa.@xcite    the ( characteristic ) example of such wannier functions constructed for latio@xmath1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.latio3wf ] ,    and their extension in the real space is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.latio3wfextension ] .",
    "the functions are well localized : about 80 - 85% of their total weight is concentrated at the central ti site , 5 - 9 % belong to neighboring oxygen sites , and about 10 % is distributed over la , ti , and o sites located in next coordination spheres .",
    "another measure of localization of the wannier functions is the expectation value of the square of the position operator : @xmath54@xmath4@xmath55@xmath45@xmath56,@xcite which yields @xmath54@xmath4 @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59  @xmath60 for @xmath38@xmath4 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively .",
    "the wannier functions for latio@xmath1 are less localized in comparison with the more distorted ytio@xmath1 , where @xmath61 is of the order of @xmath62-@xmath63  @xmath60.@xcite however , this is to be expected .    the parameters @xmath49 include all kinds of hybridization ( or covalent mixing ) effects between transition - metal @xmath0 and other atomic orbitals . however , there are other effects , which are not yet included in @xmath49 .",
    "they come from the nonsphericity ( n - s ) of the madelung potential for the electron - ion interactions , and contribute to the cf splitting .",
    "the proper correction to @xmath49 can be easily calculated in the basis of wannier functions @xmath50 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the total charge associated with the site @xmath42 ( namely , the nuclear charge minus the screening electronic charge encircled by the atomic sphere ) , and @xmath66 is the position of the electron in the sphere @xmath37 .    the main idea behind this treatment of the cf splitting is based on certain hierarchy of interactions in solids .",
    "it implies that the strongest interaction , which leads to the energetic separation of the @xmath0 band from other bands ( fig .",
    "[ fig.dossummary ] ) , is the covalent mixing .",
    "for example , in many transition - metal oxides this interaction is mainly responsible for the famous splitting between the transition - metal @xmath0 and @xmath7 states.@xcite the nonsphericity of the madelung potential is considerably weaker than this splitting .",
    "however , it can be comparable with the effects of covalent mixing in the narrow @xmath0 band .",
    "therefore , the basic idea is to treat this nonsphericity as a pseudo - perturbation,@xcite and calculate the matrix elements of the madelung potential in the basis of wannier functions constructed for spherically averaged asa potential .",
    "the same strategy can be used for the spin - orbit ( s - o ) interaction , which yields the following correction to the kinetic part of the model hamiltonian : @xmath67 ( @xmath68 being the lda potential and @xmath69 being the vector of pauli matrices ) .",
    "one of the most controversial issues , which is actively discussed in the literature , is the values and the directions of the cf splitting in the distorted @xmath0 perovskite oxides .",
    "therefore , we would like to discuss this problem more in details . basically , there are two sources of discrepancies , which largely affect the conclusions about the orbital ordering and the magnetic ground state : + 1 .",
    "( the origin of the cf splitting : the nonsphericity of the madelung potential versus the hybridization effects ) the importance of nonsphericity of the madelung potential has been emphasized by several authors . the original idea is due to mochizuki and imada , who considered the @xmath0-level splitting in the ti - compounds associated with the displacements of y and la sites.@xcite it was paraphrased by cwik  _ et al._,@xcite who suggested the main effect comes from the deformation of the tio@xmath70 octahedra .",
    "a more general picture has been considered by schmitz  _ et al._,@xcite who summed up all contributions in the madelung potential .",
    "a weak point of all these approaches is the approximate treatment of the hybridization effects , which largely relied on the model parameters .",
    "moreover , the result depends crucially on the value of the dielectric constant , which is treated as an adjustable parameter . on the other hand , the parameters of the model hamiltonians extracted from the first - principles electronic structure calculations using either downfolding ( refs .  , , and ) or wannier function ( ref .  )",
    "methods automatically include all effects of the covalent mixing . in this sense , these are more rigorous techniques .",
    "however , all these calculations were supplemented with the additional atomic - spheres - approximation and neglected the nonspherical part of the madelung potential . the madelung term has been also neglected in our previous work ( ref .  ) . as we shall see in secs .",
    "[ sec : yto ] and [ sec : lto ] , it will definitely revise several statements of ref .  .",
    "however , the final conclusion about the magnetic ground state of ytio@xmath1 and latio@xmath1 remains valid .",
    "+ 2 . ( the nonuniqueness of the wannier functions )",
    "different calculations yield different parameters of the cf splitting .",
    "for example , for latio@xmath1 different authors reported the following parameters of the cf splitting ( between lowest and highest @xmath0-levels ) : 93 mev ( ref .  ) , 200 mev ( ref .  ) , and 270 mev ( ref .  ) .",
    "there is a particularly bad custom to criticize ref .",
    ", @xcite which reports the smallest value , even with certain hints at the accuracy of calculations.@xcite it is also premature to think that the small cf splitting will inevitably lead to the orbital liquid scenario,@xcite because the transfer interactions are also strongly affected by the lattice distortion , which makes a big difference from the idealized cubic perovskites.@xcite    first , we would like to consider the second part of problem and argue that different values of the cf splitting are most likely related with the different choice of the wannier functions , which by no means is unique .",
    "this is _ not _ a problem of accuracy of calculations .    in the downfolding method employed in refs .  , , and , all basis states were divided in two groups : the `` @xmath0 '' part @xmath71 , and the `` rest '' of the basis functions @xmath72 . the effective hamiltonian is constructed by eliminating the `` rest '' part.@xcite a similar idea ( although formulated in slightly different way ) is employed in projections scheme for the construction of the wannier functions,@xcite where @xmath71 play a role of trial orbitals .",
    "the basic difficulty here is that , in the distorted perovskites , the set of atomic `` @xmath0 '' orbitals can not be defined in an unique fashion : since the local symmetry is not cubic , the abbreviations like `` @xmath0 '' and `` @xmath7 '' will always reflect some bad quantum numbers for the state , which are mixed by the crystal field and/or the transfer interactions .",
    "in numerical calculations , the set of `` @xmath0 '' orbitals is always specified in some local coordinate frame , and the choice of this frame appeared to be different in different calculations .",
    "for example , pavarini  _ et  al . _",
    "( refs .   and ) and streltsov  _ et  al .",
    "_ ( ref .  ) selected their local coordinate frames from some geometrical considerations .",
    "a completely different strategy was pursued by the present author in ref .  , where the atomic `` @xmath0 '' orbitals were determined from the diagonalization of the local density matrix constructed from the @xmath0 bands and projected onto all five @xmath73-orbitals of the transition - metal sites .",
    "then , we are ready to argue that different choice of the local coordinate frame naturally explains the difference in the parameters of the cf splitting reported by different authors . for these purposes we consider two different setups in the downfolding scheme , and consider latio@xmath1 as an example .",
    "the first scheme is absolutely identical to that proposed in ref .  , where the atomic `` @xmath0 '' orbitals have been defined as three most populated orbitals obtained from the diagonalization of the density matrix for the @xmath0 bands . in the second scheme ,",
    "we first construct a more general @xmath74@xmath75@xmath74 tight - binding hamiltonian , comprising the ti(@xmath73 ) and la(@xmath9 ) states , and reproducing the behavior of @xmath74 overlapping ti(@xmath73)-la(@xmath9 ) bands .",
    "other orbitals have been eliminated using the downfolding method .",
    "then , we diagonalize the site - diagonal part of this hamiltonian and define three lowest eigenstates at the ti - site as the atomic `` @xmath0 '' orbitals .",
    "after that we eliminate the rest of the ti(@xmath73 ) and la(@xmath9 ) states using the downfolding method and obtain the minimal @xmath76@xmath75@xmath76 hamiltonian for the @xmath0 bands .",
    "both downfolding schemes are nearly perfect and well reproduce the behavior of the @xmath0 bands in the reciprocal space ( fig .",
    "[ fig.latio3twoschemes ] ) .",
    "however , they yield very different parameters after the fourier transformation to the real space . for example , the splitting of atomic @xmath0 levels ( in mev ) obtained in the schemes i and ii is ( @xmath45@xmath77,@xmath78,@xmath79 ) and ( @xmath45@xmath80,@xmath81,@xmath82 ) , respectively . moreover , the eigenvectors corresponding to the lowest `` @xmath0 '' levels appear to be also different . in the orthorhombic coordinate frame , specified by the vectors @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ,",
    "the eigenvectors have the following form ( referred to the site 1 ) : @xmath83@xmath4@xmath84@xmath45@xmath85@xmath45@xmath86@xmath45@xmath87@xmath12@xmath88@xmath45@xmath89 and @xmath90@xmath4@xmath91@xmath45@xmath92@xmath12@xmath93@xmath12@xmath94@xmath12@xmath95@xmath45@xmath89 , for the scheme i and ii , respectively .",
    "thus , the small value of the cf splitting reported in ref .   is related with the particular choice of the wannier functions ( or the parameters of the downfolding scheme ) .",
    "had we changed our definition of the local coordinate frame , our conclusion would have been also different , and we could easily obtain the cf splitting of the order of @xmath96 mev ( and even larger ) .    then , it is of course right to ask which scheme is better ? in principle , the physics should not depend on the choice of the wannier functions , and as long as we are dealing only with the kinetic - energy part of the model hamiltonian , both schemes are totally equivalent as they equally well reproduce the behavior of the @xmath0 bands .",
    "however , what we want to do next is to combine this kinetic - energy part with the coulomb interactions , and _ to use only the site - diagonal part of these interactions_. this is of course an approximation , and in order to justify it one should guarantee that the wannier functions , which are used as the basis for the matrix elements of the coulomb interactions , were sufficiently well localized in the real space , so that all inter - site matrix elements could be neglected .",
    "the degree of localization of the wannier orbitals is related with the spread of transfer integrals .",
    "loosely speaking , in order to contribute to the transfer integral between @xmath97-@xmath98 neighbors , the wannier function should have a finite weight at this neighbor .",
    "the distance - dependence of transfer integrals calculated in two different scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.latio3twoschemes ] .",
    "one can clearly see that the transfer integrals obtained in the scheme i are indeed well localized and basically restricted by the nearest neighbors .",
    "the transfer integrals obtained in the scheme ii are less localized and spread far beyond the nearest neighbors .",
    "therefore , the wannier functions , corresponding to the scheme i , should be more localized .",
    "this is not surprising , because the scheme i guarantee that the density matrix ( or the integrated density of states ) at the transition - metal site is already well described by the central parts ( or `` heads '' ) of the wannier functions , given by the atomic orbitals @xmath71.@xcite therefore , the tails of the wannier functions , coming from the neighboring sites , should be small and cancel each other . in the scheme",
    "ii , the local density matrix is composed by both `` heads '' of the wannier functions as well as their tails coming from the neighboring sites .",
    "intuitively , this means that the tail part of the wannier functions is larger for the scheme ii and these functions are less localized .",
    "thus , we believe that the scheme i is more suitable for the purposes of our work and we apply it to all perovskite compounds .",
    "the transfer integrals , obtained in such a way , are indeed well localized and restricted by the nearest neighbors ( fig .",
    "[ fig.avrtransfer ] ) .    the next important contribution to",
    "the cf splitting comes from the nonsphericity of the madelung potential .",
    "this effect is _ comparable _ with the cf splitting of the covalent type .",
    "we have also found that there are several different contributions to the cf splitting , which tend to cancel each other .",
    "for example , the cf splitting of the covalent type in ytio@xmath1 and latio@xmath1 is largely compensated by the nonsphericity of the madelung potential coming from the region encircling the the neighboring oxygen sites and corresponding to the cut - off radius @xmath99@xmath100@xmath101    in fig .",
    "[ fig.cfconvergence].@xcite the next important contribution comes from the y / la and ti sites , located in the next coordination spheres ( @xmath99@xmath100@xmath78   ) . in some compounds , even longer - range interactions spreading up to @xmath99@xmath100@xmath30  ",
    "can have a relatively large weight in the sum ( [ eqn : cfei ] ) .",
    "the final scheme of the `` @xmath0''-level splitting , which takes into account all these effects , is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig.cfsummary ] .",
    "the splitting is not particularly large .",
    "nevertheless , as we shall see below , it appears to be sufficient in order to explain the experimentally observed orbital ordering and the magnetic ground state _ in all considered compounds , except latio@xmath1_. the madelung potential changes not only the magnitude of the crystal - field splitting , but also the _ type _ of the atomic `` @xmath0''-orbitals , which are split off by the distortion ( table  [ tab : cforbitals ] ) .",

    "this will lead to the additional spin canting away from the collinear ferromagnetic arrangement .",
    "for example , in the framework of superexchange approach we have obtained the following values of the spin and orbital magnetic moments ( in @xmath108 , referred to the site 1 ) : @xmath109@xmath4@xmath110 and @xmath111@xmath4@xmath112 .",

    "more generally , it is right to say that the magnetic coupling along the @xmath20-direction of the monoclinic phase is always either ferr__i__magnetic or antiferr__i__magnetic , because the sites @xmath118 and @xmath119 are _ not equivalent_.    the c - a - c magnetic ground state appears to be different from the magnetic structure reported by ulrich  _ et al .",

    "such a behavior has been indeed observed in our hf calculations : in addition to the c - a - c state we could obtain another self - consistent solution corresponding to the a - c - f phase with a slightly higher energy ( about @xmath120 mev per one formula unit , which is of the order of the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ) .",
    "the new phase has the following magnetic moments ( in @xmath108 , where the first and second lines corresponds to the sites @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively ) : @xmath121 although the exact form of the magnetic state a - c - f is still different from the observation by ulrich  _ et al._,@xcite we can speculate that they probably used a different experimental setup which yielded the realization of another magnetic phase , which was different from the finding by blake  _ et  al . _",

    "the first two are similar to the a - c - f and c - a - c states , emerging in monoclinic yvo@xmath1 .",
    "the only difference is that the a - c - a state has lower energy and , therefore , is realized as the ground state in the case of lavo@xmath1 . like in yvo@xmath1",
    ", the a - type state corresponds to the _ antiferrimagnetic _ ordering .",
    "therefore , lavo@xmath1 is expected to have the net magnetic moment in the @xmath122-plane .",
    "the third ( c - f - g ) solution has nearly collinear spin structure : @xmath123 it corresponds to the stable g - type afm phase emerging without the spin - orbit interaction ( see table  [ tab : yvoo ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , the a - c - a state appears to be well separated from the c - a - c and c - f - g states , correspondingly by @xmath124 and @xmath125 mev per one formula unit .",
    "the quenching of the orbital magnetic moments in two different sublattices of monoclinic yvo@xmath1 and lavo@xmath1 nicely correlates with the values of the cf splitting ( fig .",
    "[ fig.cfsummary ] ) , where larger cf splitting at the site 3 results in smaller orbital magnetization .",
    "it is probably meaningless to discuss the relativistic effects in latio@xmath1 , where we could not reproduce the correct magnetic ground state .",
    "we could agree with the criticism risen by haverkort  _ et  al . _",
    "( ref .  ) that our cf splitting alone does not explain details of their spin - resolved photoemission spectra ( actually , our value of the parameter @xmath126 , obtained in the hf calculations after the transformation to the lmto basis and radial integration over the ti - sphere is about @xmath45@xmath127 , which exceeds the experimental value by factor two ) .",
    "however , it does not make a sense to present as an alternative the results of calculations yielding the same a - type afm ground state,@xcite which totally agrees with our finding and ( unfortunately ) disagrees with the experiment , even though these calculations yield somewhat larger value of the cf splitting for latio@xmath1 . as it has been already discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : kinetic ] , different values of the cf splitting obtained by different authors are most probably related with the nonunique choice of the wannier functions for the @xmath0 bands of the distorted perovskite oxides .",
    "one can formally adjust the theoretical cf splitting in order to meet certain demands of some particular class of the experimental data .",
    "however , will it solve a more fundamental problem of the magnetic ground state of latio@xmath1 ?",
    "in addition , we show in table  [ tab : hfgs ] the values of the band gap obtained in the hf calculations for the magnetic ground state . for ytio@xmath1 , yvo@xmath1 , and",
    "lavo@xmath1 there is a good agreement with the experimental optical data.@xcite however , for latio@xmath1 the experimental gap is much smaller ( @xmath100@xmath128 ev).@xcite this may indicate again at the particular importance of correlation effects in latio@xmath1 .",
    "the main purpose of this work was to make a bridge between first - principles electronic structure calculations and model approaches for the strongly - correlated systems , and illustrate how it works for the series of distorted @xmath0 perovskite oxides .",
    "the whole plan included three major steps : _ first - principles electronic structure calculations _ @xmath11 _ construction of the model hamiltonian _ for the isolated @xmath0 bands near the fermi level @xmath11 _ solution of this model hamiltonian _ using several different approaches .",
    "the choice of the distorted @xmath0 perovskite oxides was motivated by the fact that they represent a good example of systems where it is practically impossible to construct a relevant model without the impact from the first - principles calculations : simply , the lattice distortion is too complex and there are too many model parameters , which can not be fixed in unbiased way . in this sense , we strongly believe that any theoretical model for such complex oxide materials should be based on the results of first - principles electronic structure calculations",
    ". otherwise it could be just an abstract mathematical construction deprived of clear physical grounds .",
    "the present work clearly demonstrates that nowadays the idea of constructing the parameter - free model hamiltonians for the strongly - correlated systems is quite feasible : all model parameters in our work , including the intraatomic coulomb interactions , have been derived from the first - principles calculations using the method proposed in ref .  .",
    "apart from the approximations inherent to the method , the procedure of constructing the model hamiltonian was totally parameter - free , and our analysis _ did not rely on the use of any adjustable parameters_. therefore , it is remarkable that using such a parameter - free approach we could propose a consistent explanation for a number of puzzling properties of the distorted @xmath0 perovskite oxides .",
    "these first results are really encouraging and we would like to hope that the method proposed in ref .   can be successfully applied in the future for the analysis of electronic and magnetic properties of other narrow - band compounds .    at the mean - field hartree - fock level , the results of all - electron full - potential lda@xmath12@xmath13 calculations ( refs .  )",
    "can be successfully reproduced in our model approach for the isolated @xmath0 bands .",
    "we could easily rationalize the main results of these relatively heavy calculations and elucidate the main microscopic interactions responsible for the formation of different magnetic structures in the case of ytio@xmath1 , yvo@xmath1 , and lavo@xmath1 .",
    "we argue that the nonsphericity of the madelung potential should be an indispensable ingredient of electronic structure calculations , and the results of commonly used atomic - spheres - approximation should be corrected in order to include these effects .",
    "the crystal distortion plays an important role in the physics of @xmath0 perovskite oxides . at least for ytio@xmath1 , yvo@xmath1 , and lavo@xmath1 ,",
    "the knowledge of the experimental lattice parameters and the atomic positions greatly helps in explaining the magnetic properties of these compounds . of course , some questions still remain .",
    "particularly , what is the origin of this distortion ?",
    "why is it so different for different compounds , that is finally manifested in the formation of completely different magnetic structures ?",
    "very similar arguments have been used for lamno@xmath1 , which is a characteristic example of the jahn - teller distorted @xmath7 perovskite oxides .",
    "particularly , it was argued that the experimental distortion not only stabilize the a - type afm ground state of lamno@xmath1,@xcite but is also responsible for the opening of the band gap.@xcite however , the direction of the jahn - teller distortion in lamno@xmath1 can be naturally understood in terms of anharmonicity of the electron - lattice interaction.@xcite in this sense , lamno@xmath1 is an easy example .",
    "then , is it possible to rationalize the behavior of @xmath0 perovskite oxides in a similar way and come up with some suitable electron - lattice model , which would explain not only the direction of the lattice distortion in each particular compound , but also the difference between these compounds ?    finally , we emphasize the importance of correlation effects in the @xmath0 band of distorted perovskite oxides .",
    "although the mean - field hartree - fock approach provides a satisfactory description for the magnetic properties of ytio@xmath1 , yvo@xmath1 , and lavo@xmath1 , the inclusion of the correlation effects systematically improves the agreement with the experimental data for all three compounds .",
    "definitely , latio@xmath1 is an exceptional example for which we could not obtain the correct g - type afm ground state neither at the level of hartree - fock approach nor after including some correlation effects , though in a very approximate form .",
    "however , we expect that the situation may still change by systematically employing more rigorous theories for the correlation effects .",
