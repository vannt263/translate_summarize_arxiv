    "one of the goals of the * * co**mmon * * m**uon and * * p**roton * * a**pparatus for * * s**tructure and * * s**pectroscopy ( compass ) experiment is to study the spectrum of light mesons .",
    "compass is a fixed - target experiment located at cern s super proton synchrotron ( sps ) .",
    "the mesons under study are diffractively produced by a @xmath0 negative hadron beam , consisting mostly of pions with a small admixture of kaons and anti - protons , impinging on a liquid hydrogen target .",
    "the decay products of the diffractively produced mesons are detected in a two - stage magnetic spectrometer .",
    "each of the two spectrometer stages is also equipped with an electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "this setup provides full coverage for charged and neutral particles , resulting in a homogenous acceptance over a wide kinematic range .",
    "events were recorded if a recoil proton was detected .",
    "the reaction under study here is the diffractive production of mesons decaying into three pions , either into the @xmath4 or the @xmath5 final - state . to this end ,",
    "exclusive events with a squared four - momentum transfer to the target @xmath1 between @xmath7 and @xmath8 have been selected in a three - pion mass range between @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this results in a huge dataset of @xmath11 million @xmath4 and @xmath12 million @xmath5 events .",
    "results from these two channels have already been presented before @xcite .",
    "compared to these references , the partial - wave analysis model applied to the data in the following has not only been extended in terms of the number of partial waves , but in addition the data are binned in the squared four - momentum transfer @xmath1 in order to study the dependence of the production on this variable .",
    "also a fit to the spin - density matrix of the @xmath4 channel has been performed @xcite .",
    "to decompose the three - pion mass spectra into the individual spin - parity components , a partial - wave analysis employing the isobar model is used . fig .",
    "[ fig : pwa.process ] sketches the process under study .",
    "the incoming beam @xmath13 diffractively scatters off a target proton producing an intermediate state @xmath14 , which subsequently decays into a two - pion isobar @xmath15 and a bachelor pion which have a relative orbital angular momentum @xmath16 .",
    "the two - pion isobar then decays into two pions . by exploiting the kinematic distribution in the five phase - space variables of the decay products , information on the spin @xmath17 ,",
    "the parity @xmath18 , and the spin - projection @xmath19 of @xmath14 can be extracted .",

    "in addition one incoherent wave with an isotropic angular distribution is included .",
    "the decomposition of the data into partial waves is performed with two different programs , which have been cross - checked versus each other .",
    "the fit for the @xmath4 is performed using a program originally developed at illinois @xcite , which was later modified in protvino and munich . for the fit to the @xmath5 channel rootpwa",
    "is used @xcite ( originally based on @xcite ) .",
    "a rank-1 fit is performed in bins of both the three - pion mass and the squared four - momentum transfer to the target @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : pwa.a2pi2 ] shows the incoherent sum of the intensities over the individual @xmath1 bins for the @xmath35 wave , clearly showing the @xmath36 , and the @xmath37 wave , clearly showing the @xmath38 .",
    "the results from the @xmath4 channel ( blue markers ) and the @xmath5 channel ( red markers ) are in agreement .",
    "the two data sets are normalized using the intensity integrals in each individual plot so that the peak shapes can directly be compared .",
    "in contrast to those two waves , which show the same shape also in the individual @xmath1 bins , the shape of the @xmath39 wave , where the @xmath40 is expected , changes with @xmath1 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : pwa.a1 ] ) indicating a rather large non - resonant contribution .",
    "in addition to the intensities and phase motions of a number of smaller waves that are in good agreement with resonances previously observed , one particularly interesting signal is observed in the @xmath41 wave ( fig .  [",
    "fig : pwa.a11420.a ] ) around @xmath42 .",
    "this narrow structure , never observed before , could correspond to a possible new @xmath43 state .",
    "it is seen in both channels and for all @xmath1 bins .",
    "different parameterizations for the isobars have been tested to exclude a possible artifact from the used model .",
    "to further study this new signal , and to extract breit - wigner parameters , the mass dependence of a sub - set of the spin - density matrix was extracted for the @xmath4 channel . apart from the intensities , also the interferences between the waves were taken into account .",
    "in addition to the four waves mentioned above , also the @xmath44 and the @xmath45 partial waves were included .",
    "the fit model included the following breit - wigner resonances : the @xmath40 , an @xmath46 , the @xmath36 , an @xmath47 , the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath38 , @xmath50 , and a new @xmath51 in the @xmath41 wave .",
    "the breit - wigner parameters were extracted from a simultaneous fit to the spin - density submatrices of the six partial waves in all eleven @xmath1 bins .",
    "apart from the breit - wigner components used to describe the resonances , also a coherent @xmath1-dependent non - resonant contribution was allowed in each wave .",
    "the parameters of the breit - wigner functions and the coherent background were the same in all @xmath1 bins , only the complex couplings were allowed to differ .",
    "the extracted parameters of the major resonances are in agreement with previous measurements by compass and other experiments @xcite .",
    "[ fig : pwa.a11420.b ] shows the result from this fit for the new @xmath51 . the intensity extracted by the spin - parity decomposition in three - pion mass bins ( black markers )",
    "is well described by the model ( red line ) , consisting of the resonance part ( blue line ) and a non - resonant contribution ( green line ) .",
    "a well determined mass @xmath52 and width @xmath53 was obtained for the new @xmath51 .",
    "this is in contrast to other small signals like the @xmath46 , the @xmath47 , or the @xmath50 for which a large uncertainty of the mass and width is retrieved from the same fit .    in order to exclude possible artifacts caused by the particular choice for the parametrization of the isoscalar @xmath54 isobars ,",
    "a partial - wave analysis was performed , in which the waves with @xmath29 , @xmath25 , and @xmath27 isobars are replaced by amplitudes piecewise constant in the two - pion mass @xcite .",
    "this new approach allows a rather model - independent extraction of the @xmath55 isobar amplitudes .",
    "the analysis shows a clear correlation between the new @xmath51 signal and the @xmath25 as a decay product .",
    "the compass experiment has recorded a huge dataset to study resonances produced in diffractive dissociation into three pions . the large number of events allowed to increase the number of waves used in the partial - wave analysis , while still being able to also perform a @xmath1-dependent analysis .",
    "breit - wigner parameters have been extracted from a fit to the result of the spin - parity decomposition in mass bins .",
    "apart from the well - known resonances , compass found a new signal in the @xmath41 wave around @xmath42 .",
    "it is a rather narrow object featuring a well - defined mass and width .",
    "its nature is still unclear , it could be the isospin partner of the @xmath56 , but also other explanations like rescattering effects @xcite can not be ruled out at this stage of the analysis .",
