    "@xcite the onset of bimodality was found to occur for atom numbers ``  about 5 times higher than predicted by the semiclassical theory of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) in the ideal gas '' .",
    "this roughly corresponds to the degeneracy temperature being half that of the ideal gas prediction . in a subsequent work",
    "the method for determining temperature was compared with theoretical calculations and was found to underestimate the true temperature by a factor of 0.6 - 0.7 @xcite .",
    "although residual effects of the optical lattice potential used in the ens experiment make computing @xmath52 difficult it seems that the temperature at which bimodality is observed is close to @xmath52 .",
    "recent theoretical work @xcite has also suggested that @xmath52 and @xmath0 that are quite similar for the regime of the ens experiment .",

    "the quantum monte carlo results did not analyze the transition region with the resolution we have in this work , and it is possible that the appearance of coherence before superfluidity is also revealed in their results @xcite .",
    "holzmann and coworkers have also developed a rather elegant meanfield theory for predicting superfluid transition @xcite . while providing a simple means for finding an approximate value for @xmath0 ,",

    "however , in general the ground transverse mode areal density is the relevant quantity to be used in expression ( [ eq : peakdencond ] ) ( see @xcite for additional discussion ) .",
