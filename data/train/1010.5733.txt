    "the comet reached up to + 1 magnitude .",

    "skjellerup noted that the brightness of the cometary head was about + 3 magnitude , with the diffuse coma and narrow tail about 10@xmath2 long on april 19 , 1917 @xcite .",
    "the comet is a halley - type comet , with a relatively low inclination , and has one of the smallest perihelion distances .",
    "it was observed only at one apparition . despite the relatively long observational arc",
    ", the precision of the orbital elements is questionable .",
    "@xcite published a slightly modified orbit of the comet and noted that the orbit is given with a period of @xmath3yr @xcite .",
    "the nominal orbital elements , according to jpl solar system dynamics database @xcite , are presented in table 1 .",
    "although the ascending and descending node of the nominal orbit are currently far away from the orbit of the earth , we noted a small difference in the eccentricity ( e.g. @xmath4 @xmath5 ) would change the orbit into an earth - crossing orbit as the heliocentric distance of the ascending node would become equal to 1au .",
    "the orbit has a notably small perihelion distance ( @xmath6au ) .",

    "the first few meteors associated with the comet c/1917 f1 mellish were obtained by the harvard super schmidt photographic survey @xcite .",
    "several candidates of this meteor stream , later designated as the december monocerotids ( mon ) , were also detected and distinguished by radar surveys @xcite .",
    "another study connecting the december monocerotids with the comet c/1917 f1 mellish was made by @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the radar data published by @xcite and @xcite revealed that the meteors having similar radiant positions , activity and geocentric velocities appear to have 10@xmath2 lower inclinations .",
    "@xcite noted that december monocerotids seem to have 2 components .",
    "the author also speculates that the stream may have a common origin with the geminid meteor stream .",
    "moreover , harvard radio data revealed a possible meteor stream with low inclined orbits but almost the same orbital elements as the december monocerotids , active between november 27 - december 7 @xcite .",
    "the possible genetic connection between the comet and the december monocerotids was studied by @xcite .",
    "various photographic searches confirmed the existence of a weak stream at @xmath8@xmath2 , @xmath9@xmath2 on november 27 , with @xmath10km / s @xcite .",
    "the stream was named as @xmath11-orionids ( xi - orionids , @xmath12orionids ) , currently recognized as established meteor shower november orionids ( noo ) within the iau meteor data center ( iau mdc ) catalogue @xcite and later by @xcite . moreover",
    ", other photographic december monocerotids were published @xcite and complex analysis of december monocerotids and @xmath11-orionids done by @xcite .",
    "even some historical records of fireballs might confirm that december monocerotids were active in past centuries @xcite .    in @xcite , @xcite published his telescopic meteor observation from dec .",
    "11 , 1964 and assigned 5 meteors to the new stream called 11 canis minorids .",
    "@xcite computed that these meteors have parabolic orbits and much higher inclinations ( over 100@xmath2 ) .",
    "a year later , the author suggested a connection between the shower and comet c/1917 f1 mellish @xcite and determined the activity during december 9 - 14 .",
    "@xcite revealed that 9 meteors that create the second component of the december monocerotids might be 11 canis minorids activity within december 4 - 15 .",
    "their inclination was determined as @xmath13@xmath2 and the perihelion distance as @xmath14 , which is closer to the sun compared to the nominal orbit of the comet c/1917 f1 mellish .",
    "the radiants might look like an extension of the mon activity , however , the shower might be active during the mon activity .",
    "the geocentric velocity is similar @xmath15km / s .",
    "the maximum activity of 11 canis minorids is expected at @xmath16@xmath2 ( december 3 ) .",
    "now , the december monocetorids and november orionids are weak ( few meteors per hour at maximum ) but annual established meteor showers . the shower 11 canis minorids , ( december canis minorid according to iau nomenclature )",
    "is classified as a `` working '' shower . despite several investigations , past publications analyzed only a small number of orbits and provided",
    "disperse data on the mean orbit , the position of radiant , the activity and precision of orbits , and did not reveal the orbital evolution of the meteoroid particles released from the parent comet , in order to explain the current state of these meteor showers .",
    "a significant number of the analyzed orbits are hyperbolic or parabolic .",
    "this work uses recent and precise video multi - station orbits , obtained by the sonotaco video network in japan , which provide the highest number of relatively precise meteor orbits detected continually between the years @xmath17 .",
    "the network operates with over 25 similar video - optical systems and uses the same software for meteor detection and orbit analysis ( ufocapture , ufoanalyser and ufoorbit ; @xcite ) .",
    "our goal is to provide a more complex description of meteor showers related to the comet c/1917 f1 mellish and reveal some of their obscured characteristics .",
    "the eventual objective is the investigation of the orbital evolution of meteors and the parent comet , and determination of ejection velocities near the perihelion .",

    "we demonstrated that the december monocerotids and november orionids obtained from the sonotaco database of 3 year observations ( 2007 - 2009 ) have most likely a common origin and come from the comet c/1917 f1 mellish .",
    "the common origin is supported by their similar orbital characteristics , the activity , physical properties assumed from the beginning , and the terminal heights of the meteors , the descending nodes of both showers as a function of the solar longitude , and the narrow southworth - hawkins d - criterion for most december monocerotids and november orionids with respect to the parent comet ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "direct modeling of the stream was not an option , while the orbit uncertainty of the comet avoids the selection of reliable and real starting point of the numerical integration from the past to the current date .",
    "therefore , we studied the orbital evolution of the nominal orbit of the comet , cometary clones within the known orbital uncertainties , and the orbital evolution of precise meteor orbits . the dispersion of the orbital elements , the radiants and nominal orbit of the parent comet , currently beyond the orbital elements , suggest that the november orionids is an older stream than december monocerotids .",
    "the orbital evolution of both streams , the nominal orbit of the comet and its clones imply that the orbital evolution is causing november orionids to have 10@xmath2 lower inclinations than december monocerotids .",
    "there is a non - zero chance of a close encounter of the comet with venus or mercury which could cause a sudden change in the inclination of the parent comet .",
    "furthermore , a close encounter with a planet might cause the tidal breakup of the comet and create a significant release of matter .",
    "the scenario of the cometary core disintegration might also be supported by the extremely low perihelion distance of the parent comet and both meteor showers .",
    "another option is a gradual shift in the inclination , demonstrated in the simulation . but a change in the inclination of more than @xmath19 of the parent comet would be solved only through a longer orbital evolution .",
    "this option is also obscured while we do not observe any orbits between relatively well defined clumps of the december monocerotids and november orionids in the @xmath20 phase space and radiant sky - plane distributions .",
    "eventually there is a wide and massive stream of the meteoroids but only some of them have ascending nodes close to the earth s orbit ; and due to selectional effects , we may observe two distinguished streams and only the distant edge of the stream .",
    "the nodal distance of the comet is currently more than 0.2au from the earth s orbit and it retreated in the past increasingly , as well as the ascending nodes of the observed meteors .",
    "the observed shower meteors might have left the cometary nucleus a few centuries ago but , due to the stable orbit of the comet , both streams might be replenished regularly and weak shower activity might be observed each year .",
    "the semimajor axes of both meteor streams are much lower than the nominal orbit of the comet or its clones evolution 5000yr to the past .",
    "almost no change of the semimajor axes of meteoroids within the orbital evolution suggests that these particles were injected directly into these orbits right after ejection from the cometary nucleus .",
    "we determined that transversal component of the ejection velocity would be about @xmath21 if the ejection occurred at the perihelion .",
    "further precise orbits and physical data of the december monocerotids and november orionids are needed for additional research .",
    "the key question is the accuracy of the c/1917 f1 mellish orbit .",
    "a new measurements of the photographic plates of the comet might reveal a more precise orbit and bring new light onto the orbital evolution of the comet and its meteors .",
    "our work did not confirm any december canis minorids meteors in the sonotaco database ; however , 6 candidates were selected .",
    "their connection to the comet c/1917 f1 mellish is uncertain .",
    "this work was supported by slovak grant agency vega , no . 1/0636/09 and by a grant of comenius uviversity , no ."
