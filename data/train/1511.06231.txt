    "<S> moreover , we analyze the phonon spectrum of pbtase@xmath0 to show how superconductivity can emerge due to a stiffening of phonons by the pb intercalation , which diminishes a competing charge - density - wave instability . </S>",
    "<S> our work establishes pbtase@xmath0 as a stoichiometric superconductor with nontrivial @xmath1 topological band structure , showing it holds great promise for studying aspects of topological superconductors such as majorana zero modes .    </S>",
    "<S> the interplay of topology and interacting electronic instabilities promises new ways to realize exotic physical phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> majorana zero modes have been theoretically proposed to exist in the vortex core of chiral @xmath2-wave superconductors @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these systems are topological due to the unconventional form of their order parameter , while their electronic band structure can be topologically trivial . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , electrons rarely form a chiral @xmath2-wave superconducting order in real materials . in a seminal work , fu and </S>",
    "<S> kane  @xcite realized that this can be overcome by interchanging the role of band structure and order parameter : majorana zero modes can also appear when the topological surface states of a @xmath1 topological band structure are gapped due to ordinary @xmath3-wave superconducting pairing . </S>",
    "<S> multiple routes that have been proposed to realize this idea . </S>",
    "<S> one is to dope topological insulators ( tis ) , for example with copper atoms , giving rise to a transition temperature @xmath4 up to 3.8 k in bi@xmath0se@xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , this approach requires fine tuning of the chemical doping composition and also introduces in an uncontrollable way chemical disorder into the system . besides </S>",
    "<S> , the nature of the resulting superconductivity remains unclear . </S>",
    "<S> another approach is to artificially fabricate ti thin layers on top of a superconductor @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> helical pairing of dirac surface states induced by the proximity effect has been observed experimentally @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , complex interface interaction hinders a comprehensive understanding of the induced helical cooper pairing and the superconducting gap drops steeply as the film thickness increases , which places stringent requirements on material synthesis . </S>",
    "<S> a way that overcomes these difficulties is to search for chemically stoichiometric superconductors which possess intrinsically topological surface states . to date , a stoichiometric superconductors with nontrivial topological band structure remains elusive in real materials .    in this paper , we use first - principles calculations and arpes experiments to show that pbtase@xmath0 , a recently discovered non - centrosymmetric superconductor  @xcite , possesses a nonzero @xmath1 topological invariant and topologically protected surface states . </S>",
    "<S> pbtase@xmath0 is part of the family of layered transition metal dichalcogenide ( tmd ) superconductors , several of which show a competition between charge density wave ( cdw ) and superconducting order  @xcite . for example , in cu@xmath6tise@xmath0 a superconducting dome appears to cover the quantum critical point at the copper doping at which the cdw phase terminates  @xcite . to understand how superconductivity can compete with the cdw instability in pbtase@xmath0 </S>",

    "<S> a hexagonal ta atomic plane is sandwiched by two hexagonal se atomic planes , forming strong ionic bonds within a local trigonal structure . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice can also be viewed as a pb layer intercalating two adjacent tase@xmath0 layers with pb atoms sitting right above se atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the pb - se bonds are relatively weak compared to the ionic ta - se bonds . </S>",
    "<S> this soft bonding plays an important role in the emergent superconductivity in pbtase@xmath0 , as will be discussed later . for this study , </S>",

    "<S> figure [ band](d ) shows the bulk band structure of pbtase@xmath0 , calculated with the gga method without the inclusion of spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the pb @xmath9-orbitals and ta @xmath10-orbitals dominate the bands around the fermi energy @xmath11 , while se 2@xmath2 states are mainly below @xmath12  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the pb @xmath9-bands display electron - like band dispersion crossing @xmath11 with a bandwidth larger than 7  ev and form a dirac bulk band dispersion at the @xmath13 point below the fermi level [ marked by gray areas in fig . </S>",

    "<S> note that the band dispersion along @xmath17@xmath13@xmath18 ( @xmath19 = 0 ) is very different from that along @xmath20@xmath15@xmath21 ( @xmath19 = @xmath22 ) , which indicates the coupling along @xmath23 direction can not be neglected even though the crystal is comprised of two - dimensional layers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this non - negligible interlayer coupling along the @xmath23 direction results in a surprising large electron - phonon coupling at @xmath21 , which will be discussed later . when soc is turned on , the band crossings in fig . </S>",

    "<S> the band structure shows significant spin - orbit splitting due to the breaking of spatial inversion symmetry , except at the time - reversal invariant points ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) of the bz .    to understand the emergence of superconductivity in pbtase@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we performed systematic calculations for the electron - phonon couplings . since bulk 2@xmath15-tase@xmath0 is known to exhibit a cdw instability below 122k @xcite , we first examine the stability of monolayer ( ml ) tase@xmath0 which is a building block of pbtase@xmath0 . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ep](b ) , the cdw instability is also seen in ml tase@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this instability results from the negative phonon energy of the @xmath7 mode that involves the horizontal motions of ta and vertical motions of se . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ ep](c ) shows the phonon spectrum of pbtase@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the cdw instability is eliminated by the intercalation of pb layer . the phonon spectrum in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ep](c ) is displayed with the decomposition of atomic vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> the soft phonons stem mostly from the vibration of pb atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the tase@xmath0-related phonons are pushed upward , partly due to the fact that the originally unstable phonons that involve the vertical motions of se are stiffened by the pb intercalation . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the energy of phonons along @xmath17@xmath20 is very low , which implies that the pb intercalation moves the system to the vicinity of another cdw instability that corresponds to the relative sliding between the tase@xmath0 slabs and the pb sheets . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood from the fact that the vertical bonding between tase@xmath0 and pb-@xmath24/@xmath25 orbitals is very weak . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ep](d ) , the strength of electron - phonon coupling is visualized by red dots to reveal the @xmath26-dependence of the electron - phonon coupling ( @xmath27 ) . in our calculations </S>",
    "<S> , we find the total electron - phonon coupling @xmath28 to be @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> using the the mcmillan formula ( please see method section for details ) , the superconducting transition temperature @xmath30 is estimated to be 3.1 k. our calculation agrees well with the results from the polycrystalline transport and specific heat experiments @xcite ( @xmath31 = 0.74 and @xmath32 3.8 k ) and our single crystal transport measurement , indicative of a bcs - like superconductivity in pbtase@xmath0 . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ep](d ) , the major contribution to the effective electron - phonon coupling comes from the @xmath7 phonons at @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this wave vector does not lead to any apparent nesting of the band structure , which might be a reason why it does not trigger a cdw instability . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that this surprisingly large coupling strength takes place at @xmath21 , but not at @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this difference lies in their influence on the se - ta - se bond angle when the @xmath7 phonons vibrate with different wavevector @xmath33 . at @xmath21 , the two pb atoms that sandwich the tase@xmath0 slab move in opposite directions [ fig . [ ep](e ) ] , which greatly alters the se - ta - se bond angle . at @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the in - phase motions of these two pb atoms in @xmath23 direction exert less influence on the se - ta - se bond angle . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the bond angle has been shown to yield modifications of the electronic structures of tmds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the enhanced change of the bond angle induced by the @xmath7 phonon at @xmath21 explains the large effective electron - phonon coupling .    from our analysis of the phonon spectrum </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that the emergence of superconductivity in pbtase@xmath0 can be attributed to the disappearance of the cdw . </S>",
    "<S> this is a common physical mechanism in tmds where the cdw and superconductivity compete with each other @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mostly , the cdw predominates in the competition for the gapping of fermi surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> superconductivity takes place when the cdw is suppressed by either pressurization or doping @xcite . in pbtase@xmath0 , </S>",
    "<S> the phonon stiffening due to the pb intercalation makes it energetically unfavorable to form the cdw order , opening the way for the transition into a superconducting phase .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the topological aspects of the electronic structure of pbtase@xmath0 . in most typical three - dimensional tis </S>",
    "<S> ( such as bi@xmath0se@xmath5 ) the non - trivial topological bands originate from a band inversion induced by the soc . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario in pbtase@xmath0 is rather different : an inverted band structure with two different orbital characters ( pb-@xmath2 and ta-@xmath34 ) exists in pbtase@xmath0 even without soc as the highly dispersive pb and ta bands cross each other close to the fermi level . the role of soc in pbtase@xmath0 is to gap out the dirac - like band dispersion at @xmath13 and other band crossings in the bz [ highlighted by gray shades in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ band](f ) ] , forming a continuous energy gap across the whole bz . </S>",
    "<S> this is analogous to graphene in which the dirac band at the @xmath13 point is gapped by the intrinsic soc resulting in a quantum spin hall phase , while the band structure is inverted at the @xmath18 points already in absence of soc @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , even though pbtase@xmath0 has a metallic ground state , in presence of soc the valence band remains separated from the conduction band by a continuous gap throughout the whole bz . </S>",
    "<S> this allows to associate a well - defined @xmath1 topological invariant with the band structure  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since pbtase@xmath0 lacks inversion symmetry , the @xmath1 topological invariant can not be computed via a parity analysis @xcite . for this reason , we calculated the @xmath1 index by the hybrid wannier functions method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 topological number is extracted from a first - principles calculation using the quantum espresso code @xcite within the framework of the local density approximation ( lda ) with soc taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> a 30@xmath3530@xmath3515 @xmath36-grid is used to sample the bz . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation shows a non - zero @xmath1 number ( @xmath37 ) , indicating that pbtase@xmath0 is in the topological insulator phase .    </S>",
    "<S> non - trivial topology of bulk band structure guarantees the existence of gapless surface states which are the hallmark of topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is not clear a priori whether these surface states are observable if the band structure is metallic . </S>",
    "<S> the projection of the bulk bands in the surface bz could cover the topological surface states . in the following we present first principle calculations and arpes measurements showing that the surface states can indeed be observed in the ( 001 ) surface of pbtase@xmath0 thanks to the layered nature of the material . </S>",

    "<S> red and blue lines represent surface and bulk states projected onto the ( 001 ) surface [ fig . [ band](c ) ] , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the gapless surface band lies in the continuous energy gap around the @xmath38 point . along @xmath38@xmath39 and @xmath38@xmath40 </S>",

    "<S> the intensity from the hole - like pocket varies prominently with photon energy , clearly indicating that it is part of the bulk band structure . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the band labelled s1 poking the fermi level in between @xmath38 and @xmath39 shows a dispersion independent of photon energy , which evidences the surface nature of this band . </S>",
    "<S> we plot energy distribution curves [ edc , fig .  </S>",

    "<S> furthermore , the proximity - induced surface superconductivity in a bulk compound such as pbtase@xmath0 can be stronger than in an artificial ti - sc heterostructure since in an intrinsic superconductor there exists neither attenuation due to the finite thickness of the ti layer nor the complex interfacial condition @xcite . to show the superconducting proximity effect , we performed a simulation with an effective hamiltonian for a 12-layer pbtase@xmath0 slab . in the model </S>",
