    "investigating the properties of rubidium ( rb ) atom is of immense interest for a number of applications @xcite .",
    "it is one of the most widely used atom in quantum computational schemes using rydberg atoms , where the hyperfine states of the ground state of rb atom are defined as the qubits @xcite .",
    "it is also used to study quantum phase transitions of mixed - species with degenerate quantum gases @xcite .",
    "there are several proposals to carry out precision studies in this atom such as constructing ultra - precise atomic clocks @xcite , probing parity non - conservation effects @xcite , finding its permanent electric dipole moment @xcite etc .",
    "also , a number of measurements and calculations of lifetimes for many low - lying states in rb have been performed over the past few decades @xcite .",
    "it is found that there are inconsistencies between the calculated and measured values of the lifetimes of atomic states in this atom @xcite . in this context , it is necessary to carry out further theoretical studies in this atom .    due to simple single - core electron structure of this atom ,",
    "it is adequate to employ advanced many - body methods for precise calculation of its properties which ultimately act as benchmark tests for the experimental measurements @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we determine polarizabilities of the ground @xmath0 and excited @xmath1 states and study the differential ac stark shifts between these two states . in this process",
    ", we also analyse the reduced matrix elements and their accuracies which are further used to estimate precisely the lifetimes of few excited states in this atom . aim of our present study is to analyse results of differential ac stark shifts from which we can deduce the magic wavelengths ( see below for definition ) that are of great use in state - insensitive trapping of rb atoms .",
    "manipulation of cold and ultracold rb atoms has been widely done by using optical traps @xcite . for a number of applications ( such as atomic clocks and quantum computing  @xcite ) , it is often desirable to optically trap the neutral atoms without affecting the internal energy - level spacing for the atoms .",
    "however in an experimental set up , the interaction of an atom with the externally applied oscillating electric field of the trapping beam causes ac stark shifts of the atomic levels inevitably . for any two internal states of an atom , the stark shifts caused due to the trap light are in general different which affects the fidelity of the experiments @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed the idea of tuning the trapping laser to a magic wavelength ,  @xmath4 \" , at which the differential ac stark shifts of the transition is terminated . using this approach the magic wavelength for the @xmath5 transition in @xmath6sr",
    "was determined with a high precision to be 813.42735(40 ) @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "_ demonstrated the state - insensitive trapping of cs at @xmath8 935 @xmath7 while still maintaining a strong coupling with the @xmath9 transition @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the magic wavelengths for the @xmath10 transitions for other alkali atoms ( from na to cs ) by calculating dynamic polarizabilities using a relativistic coupled - cluster ( rcc ) method .",
    "theoretical values for these quantities were calculated at wavelengths where the ac polarizabilities for two states involved in the transition cancel . the data in ref .",
    "@xcite provides a wide range of magic wavelengths for the alkali - metal atoms trapped in linearly polarized light by evaluating electric dipole ( e1 ) matrix elements obtained by linearized rcc method . in this paper",
    ", we try to evaluate these matrix elements considering all possible non - linear terms in the rcc method .",
    "in addition , we would like to optimize the matrix elements using the precisely known experimental results of lifetimes and static polarizabilities for different atomic states and re - investigate the above reported magic wavelengths in the considered atom .",
    "it is also reported in ref . @xcite",
    "that trapping rb atoms in the linearly polarized light offers only a few suitable magic wavelengths for the state - insensitive scheme .",
    "this persuades us to look for more plausible cases for constructing state - insensitive traps of rb atoms using the circularly polarized light .",
    "using the circularly polarized light may be advantageous owing to the dominant role played by vector polarizabilities ( which are absent in the linearly polarized light ) in estimating the ac stark shifts .",
    "moreover , these vector polarizabilities act as  fictitious magnetic fields \" , turning the ac stark shifts to the case analogous to the zeeman shifts @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows , in sections [ sec2 ] and [ sec3 ] , we discuss in brief the theory of dipole polarizability and method used for calculating them precisely . in section [ sec4 ] ,",
    "we first discuss in detail the evaluation of matrix elements used for precise estimation of polarizability and then present our magic wavelengths first for the linearly polarized light following which for the circularly polarized light . unless stated otherwise , we use the conventional system of atomic units ( au ) , in which @xmath11 , @xmath12 , 4@xmath13 , and the reduced planck constant @xmath14 have the numerical value 1 throughout this paper .",
    "the @xmath15 energy level of an atom placed in a static electric field @xmath16 can be expressed using a time - independent perturbation theory as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18s are the unperturbed energy levels in the absence of electric field , @xmath19 represent the intermediate states allowed by the dipole selection rules and @xmath20 is the interaction hamiltonian with @xmath21 as the electric - dipole operator .",
    "since the first - order correction to the energy levels is zero in the present case , therefore we can approximate the energy shift at the second - order level for a weak field @xmath16 and write it in terms of dipole moments @xmath22 as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the e1 amplitude between @xmath26 and @xmath27 states . a more traditional notation of the above equation is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is known as the static polarizability of the @xmath30 state which",
    "is written as @xmath31 if the applied field is frequency - dependent ( ac field ) , then we can still express the change in energy as @xmath32 with @xmath29 as a function of frequency given by @xmath33 . \\ \\",

    "therefore , @xmath34 is further rewritten as @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 define degree of circular polarization , angle between wave vector of the electric field and @xmath41-axis and angle between the direction of polarization and @xmath41-axis , respectively . here",

    "( [ cc1 ] ) instead of eq .",
    "( [ cc2 ] ) as was taken before in our previous calculations @xcite .",

    "the excitation amplitudes for the @xmath58 operators are determined by solving @xmath61 where @xmath62 represents singly and doubly excited configurations from @xmath63 .",
    "similarly , the excitation amplitudes for the @xmath59 operators are determined by solving @xmath64 taking @xmath65 as the singly and doubly excited configurations from @xmath60 .",
    "the above equation is solved simultaneously with the calculation of attachment energy @xmath66 for the valence electron @xmath54 using the expression @xmath67 the triples effect are incorporated through the calculation of @xmath66 by including valence triple excitation amplitudes perturbatively ( e.g. see @xcite for the detailed discussion ) .    to determine polarizabilities , we divide various correlation contributions to it into three parts as @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 represents scalar , vector and tensor polarizabilities , respectively , and the notations @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath54 in the parentheses correspond to core , core - valence and valence correlations , respectively .",

    "we determine the valence correlation contributions to the polarizability in the sum - over - states approach @xcite by evaluating their matrix elements by our ccsd(t ) method and using the experimental energies @xcite for the important intermediate states .",
    "contributions from the higher excited states and continuum are accounted from the following expression @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the corresponding angular factors for different values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 is treated as the first order wave function to @xmath77 due to the dipole operator @xmath78 @xcite at the third order many - body perturbation ( mbpt(3 ) method ) level and given as @xmath79 .",

    ". calculation procedures of these expressions are discussed in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "our aim is to determine the magic wavelengths for the linearly and circularly polarized electric fields for the @xmath85 transitions in rb atom . to determine these wavelengths precisely , we need accurate values of polarizabilities which depend upon the excitation energies and the e1 matrix elements between the intermediate states of the corresponding states . in this respect ,",
    "we first present below the e1 matrix elements between different transitions and discuss their accuracies .",
    "then we overview the current status of the polarizabilities reported in literature and compare our results with them .",

    "uncertainties in the ccsd(t ) results are given in the parentheses . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however , the case for the @xmath87 transition is different owing to the presence of non - zero tensor contribution of the @xmath88 state . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figrb-2 ] , we get different magic wavelengths for the @xmath87 transition at @xmath89 and @xmath90 sub - levels of the @xmath88 state .",
    "there are few wavelengths in between resonances where @xmath91 with @xmath92 contribution is not same as the @xmath93 .",
    "this leads to reduction in the number of magic wavelengths for this transition .",
    "for example , we did not find any @xmath4 between the @xmath94 resonances ( at 1529 @xmath7 ) and the @xmath95 resonance ( at 1367 @xmath7 ) for @xmath90 sublevels of the @xmath88 state .    we have limited our search for the magic wavelengths where the differential polarizabilities between the @xmath0 and @xmath96 states are less than 0.5% . based on all these data , we list now @xmath4 ( in vacuum ) above 600 @xmath7 in table [ tabrb - linear ] for the @xmath97 and @xmath98 transitions in rb atom and compare them with the previously known results .",
    "the present results are improved slightly due to the optimized e1 matrix elements used here .",
    "the uncertainties in our magic wavelength results are found as the maximum differences between the @xmath99 and @xmath100 contributions with their respective magnetic quantum numbers , where the @xmath101 are the uncertainties in the polarizabilities for their corresponding states .",
    "the reason for not acquiring sufficient number of magic wavelengths for the @xmath98 transition lies in the fact that extra contribution from the tensor polarizability to the total @xmath88 polarizability is not compensated by the counter part of the @xmath0 state .",
    "the idea of using the circularly polarized light to obtain magic wavelengths for the @xmath98 transition is triggered from that fact that the extra contribution from the tensor polarizability to the @xmath88 state might be cancelled by the vector polarizability contributions or the vector polarizabilities are so large that they may play a dominant role in determining the differential polarizabilities .",
