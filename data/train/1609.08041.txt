    "the distribution of reflected field intensity can be engineered by shaping the reflecting surface . due to the differences of the ray - propagation path lengths ,",

    "reflectarrays with subwavelength distances between the array elements are called high - impedance surfaces @xcite or metasurfaces @xcite .    according to the phased - array principle , to reflect an incident plane wave ( the incidence angle @xmath0 ) into another plane wave , breaking the usual reflection law ( the reflection angle @xmath1 )",
    ", the reflection phase should linearly depend on the corresponding coordinate along the reflector plane .",
    "in this situation one can expect that reflections from all the points interfere constructively in a plane wave propagating in the desired direction .",
    "recently , this simple design principle was formulated in form of the `` generalized snell s law '' @xcite . to understand this law ,",
    "let us assume that a plane wave is incident at a planar reflecting surface at the incidence angle @xmath0 and introduce a cartesian coordinate system with the @xmath2-axis along the projection of the wavevector to the reflector plane .",
    "if the reflected plane wave is propagating at the reflection angle @xmath3 and its amplitude is the same as in the incident wave , then the ratio of the tangential electric fields in the reflected wave and in the incident wave at the reflector surface is given by @xmath4 $ ] . here , @xmath5 is the wavenumber in the background isotropic medium , and we assume the time - harmonic dependency @xmath6 .",
    "obviously , there is a relation between the reflection angle and the gradient of the reflection phase profile _",
    "i-_r=1k_1d(x)dx , grl which is called the generalized reflection law @xcite .",
    "this design approach has been used to realize various metasurfaces for reflection control , for example , in @xcite , as well as in all known designs of reflectarrays @xcite .",
    "however , it is easy to see that this simplistic method does not allow one to exactly realize the desired performance : some part of the incident energy is inevitable scattered in non - desired directions ( parasitic specular reflection , etc . ) or absorbed in the reflector @xcite .",
    "parasitic reflections or absorptions are inevitable within this scenario because the boundary conditions on the lossless surface which has the reflection phase as dictated by are not satisfied by the desired field distribution .",
    "thus , in all known realizations the power efficiency defined as the ratio of the power sent into the desired direction and the incident power is typically quite low and it decreases when the desired reflection angle deviates more and more from the specular reflection angle .",
    "very recently , it was shown that it is in principle possible to realize anomalously reflecting metasurfaces which operate perfectly , that is , without any parasitic reflections and scattering @xcite .",
    "such perfect anomalous reflectors must be either active or realize non - local reflections , that is , the incident energy is not immediately reflected at the incident point , but it is first transported along the surface at some distance @xcite . in paper @xcite , an alternative theoretical approach was introduced ( based on interference with additional evanescent waves ) and a conceptual design based on three parallel inhomogeneous reactive sheets has been proposed , but no actual realizations are known , to the best of our knowledge .    inspired by the physical principle of leaky - wave antennas , we demonstrate that a perfect anomalous reflector can be realized as a simple metal pattern on a thin grounded dielectric slab . in this scenario ,",
    "engineered modulations of the surface reactance ensure the required non - local reflections , which are eventually perfectly launched only in the desired direction .",
    "based on the developed theory we design , manufacture , and experimentally study an example metareflector which reflects a normally incident plane wave into a plane wave at the tilt angle @xmath7 .",
    "the experimental results confirm that this first prototype of metasurfaces for perfect control of reflections operates according to expectations : the realized power efficiency is close to 100% , limited only by dissipation in the metal patches and the dielectric substrate . parasitic reflections into the specular direction and other directions are seen to be negligible .",
    "the proposed simple topology allows cheap mass - production manufacturing based on the conventional printed circuit board technology ( microwave frequencies ) or various lithography techniques ( terahertz and beyond ) .",
    "metasurfaces for anomalous reflection based on the known generalized reflection law are designed for ensuring at every point of the surface a phase shift in reflection according to @xmath8 with @xmath0 and @xmath3 being the incidence and reflection angles , respectively , while the amplitude of the reflection coefficient is unity ( neglecting dissipation losses ) .",
    "the local reflection coefficient defines a periodically modulated boundary surface with the surface impedance @xmath9 .",
    "the relation between the reflection coefficient and the surface impedance can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the wave impedance of the background medium .",
    "considering lossless implementations , the surface impedance is purely imaginary and using ( [ eq : phase_shift ] ) can be expressed as @xmath12.\\ ] ]    equation ( [ eq : conventional ] ) is a well - known solution that has been used in numerous works .",
    "examples of reflective metasurfaces designed following this approach can be found in papers @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the sum of the incident and one reflected plane wave is not a valid solution for the maxwell equations with the surface impedance given by ( [ eq : conventional ] ) .",
    "this means that when we illuminate a metasurface characterized by the surface impedance given by the generalized reflection law ( [ eq : conventional ] ) with a plane wave at @xmath0 , in addition to the desired anomalously reflected plane wave at @xmath3 , more plane waves will be exited in the system in order to satisfy the power conservation and the boundary conditions , leading to parasitic reflections .",

    "the period will define the directions where the reflected energy can flow .",

    "in contrast , in the areas where the energy should be launched into the desired direction , the sync should hold for the reflected plane wave .    to realize such operation , we propose to modulate the reflection phase linearly , using the generalized reflection law separately for these two parts of the metasurface period .",

    "the remaining 6.2% of power incident on the metasurface is mainly absorbed by it .    in the third measurement",
    ", we fixed the orientation of the metasurface at @xmath104 and utilized the transmitting antenna ( fixed at the same position as in previous measurements ) as both the transmitter and receiver . using conventional time gating post - processing procedure",
    ", we could filter out all parasitic reflections received by the antenna ( from the walls , absorbers , and due to the impedance mismatch between the antenna and the cables ) , retaining only the signal reflected from the metasurface .",
    "the measured signal amplitude was normalized by the corresponding amplitude from the reference uniform aluminium plate which was measured likewise .",
    "this ratio , plotted in fig .",
    "[ ris : figexp2c ] , represents the level of specular reflection from the metasurface @xmath101 when illuminated normally . as is seen , at the resonance frequency 8.08  ghz",
    "the specular reflection is @xmath108  db , which corresponds to 0.5% of the incident power .",
    "this result additionally confirms that the normally illuminated metasurface reflects all the power at the desired angle @xmath97 . as is seen from fig .",
    "[ ris : figexp2c ] , at frequencies below 7.2  ghz where the metal strips on the substrate are weakly excited , the metasurface behaves as a usual mirror obeying the simple reflection law .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that by proper design of planar inhomogeneous low - loss reflectors it is possible to realize conceptually perfect anomalous reflection , transforming a plane wave coming from an arbitrary direction into a single plane wave propagating into any other direction .",
    "the introduced approach fully removes the fundamental limitations on the performance of known reflectarray antennas and known metasurfaces designed with the use of the generalized snell s law .",
    "the `` active - lossy '' behavior of conceptually perfect anomalously reflected metasurfaces was realized with the use of carefully engineered effects of strong spatial dispersion in an inhomogeneous leaky - wave structure .",
    "although in this first demonstration we assumed that the incidence is a single plane wave , the proposed physical mechanism of non - local reflections allows generalizations for arbitrary illuminations , opening possibilities for creation of metasurfaces for shaping waves without loosing power for parasitic scattering .",
