    "these researchers consider that chemical reactions in a confined cell - like structure are an important step to life .",
    "a cell is separated from the outside region by a membrane , and complicated chemical reactions occur only inside the cell . some materials and reactants are transported through the membrane .",
    "the consumption of nutrient and doing away of waste matter through the membrane is a basic process of metabolism , and then highly active nonequilibrium state is maintained inside of the cell . inside and outside of the cell",
    ", materials are in the aqueous solution , but the membrane is composed of lipid .",
    "therefore , the transport coefficients are different at the membrane . to understand the confined or localized nonequilibrium states accompanying the transport of materials through the membrane qualitatively , we will study a simple reaction - diffusion system called the schlgl model in a vesicle with a semi - permeable membrane .",
    "we do not consider complicated reactions including dna , rna and so on , and do not consider active transport through the membrane , so it might be too simple as a model of a living cell .",
    "that is , our model is not a realistic model , but a toy model to consider `` metabolism '' from a view point of dissipative structure far from equilibrium .",
    "the schlgl model is a set of chemical reactions including three kinds of chemicals u , v and w @xcite represented as @xmath0 we interpret the three chemicals v , u and w respectively as nutrient material , self - catalytic product and waste material .",

    "an example of the extended state is shown in fig .",

    ", the equilibrium condition @xmath18 is almost satisfied .",

    "found spatial bistability of the thermodynamic state and the flow state in the chlorine - dioxide - iodide reaction in a thin film of gel fed from one side @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of the spatial bistability is also maintained by the supply of chemicals at the boundary .",
    "if we consider nonzero diffusivity at least for v and w , the reactants and the waste materials are transported through the membrane and the nonequilibrium state is maintained . if @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the nutrient is not supplied through the membrane , and only the death state @xmath53 appears as shown in fig .",
    "if @xmath74 and @xmath75 , the nutrient is supplied but the product and the waste material are not sent out from the cell .",
    "then , an equilibrium state @xmath76 is attained for @xmath77 as shown in fig .",
    "if the diffusion constants @xmath78 and @xmath79 are all 0 , the cell is completely isolated from the outside . in that case , the equilibrium state @xmath18 is attained inside of the cell as shown in fig .",

    "as a result of the conservation of the total concentration , the final concentration becomes the average value 0.5 of the initial concentrations .",
    "thus , we see that the localized state shown in fig .  1(a ) is maintained only in the nonequilibrium condition .    even if @xmath84 is not zero , the localized nonequilibrium state such as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) can not be maintained , if the cell size @xmath12 is sufficiently large , because the central region of the cell is far away from the outside and an nearly equilibrium state is realized .",

    "our numerical result is that the localized nonequilibrium state exists only for small cell size @xmath12 .",
    "the result suggests that the cell size can not become too large in the primitive type metabolism , because the material transport occurs only through the simple diffusion .",
