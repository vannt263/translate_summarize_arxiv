    "the interest in josephson junction arrays in the last decade was to a large degree prompted by the fact that these systems are suitable as a testing ground for various predictions of quantum many - body theory ( for an overview see , e.g. , refs .  ) . if the charging energy of a junction @xmath0 is comparable with its josephson energy @xmath1 , the phase of the superconducting order parameter is subject to quantum fluctuations ( here @xmath2 is the capacitance of a junction ) . at some critical value of @xmath3 the global phase coherence",
    "is destroyed , and the array becomes an insulator@xcite .",
    "this transition apparently is driven by proliferation of spontaneously created vortices , i.e. , topological excitations of the array , in which the phase of the order parameter varies by @xmath4 on going around a plaquette . at smaller ratios",
    "@xmath3 vortices induced by an external magnetic field still possess quantum properties .",
    "the vortex dynamics is particularly sensitive to the quantum fluctuations of the phase : the vortex mass , for example , is finite entirely due to these fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a single vortex in a josephson junction array behaves as a ballistically propagating quantum particle@xcite .",
    "these particles are strongly interacting , however : for the values of @xmath5 at which the global phase coherence is preserved , their interaction energy @xmath6 is larger than the bandwidth for a single vortex .",
    "a finite magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the array , creates a lattice with a vortex density proportional to the field strength .",
    "depending on the magnetic field flux per plaquette , the vortex lattice is commensurate or incommensurate with the junction array@xcite .",
    "the commensurability effect exists of course even for classical vortices in an array with @xmath7 .",
    "the array acts like a periodic potential with an amplitude @xmath8 and some period @xmath9 ( the period of the josephson array ) for each vortex@xcite . in a classical system , this is expected to be a source of strong pinning , as @xmath10 and @xmath11 are of the same order .",
    "quantum fluctuations bring new physics into the problem .",
    "the period of the pinning potential is relatively small , and therefore its amplitude is suppressed readily by quantum fluctuations . on the contrary , depending on the magnetic field , the vortex lattice period may be significantly larger than @xmath9 , thus making the vortex lattice robust against quantum fluctuations .",
    "commensurability effects in a chain of quantum vortices were investigated in the recent experiments of oudenaarden _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "there a number of two - dimensional arrays with various ratios @xmath3 , and various widths of the order of @xmath12 cells were studied .",
    "all arrays were quasi - one - dimensional in fact , their length varying between @xmath13 and @xmath14 cells .",
    "superconducting contacts parallel to the long sides of the array were providing a potential confining the vortices to the central row of the array , see fig .  [ array ] . applying a current through the leads ( perpendicular to the one - dimensional vortex chain ) and measuring the resistance of the system as a function of the magnetic field , van oudenaarden _",
    "et al . _ found almost zero resistance in the regions centered around the commensurate values of the one - dimensional vortex density .",
    "this was interpreted as an indication of a finite - gap state ( `` mott insulator '' phase ) , induced by the vortex - vortex interaction in the presence of a periodic potential . if the magnetic field was tuned away from these special regions , a transition to a resistive state",
    "was observed , indicating moving vortices ( `` conducting '' phase ) .",
    "the analogy between the observed transition in the system of vortices and the textbook mott transition in electron systems can be made more explicit : @xmath3 here plays the role of the ratio @xmath15 of the electron bandwidth to the on - site repulsion potential ; the magnetic field @xmath16 , creating vortices , plays the role of the electron chemical potential @xmath17 . the phase diagram in the variables @xmath18 consists of two phases .",
    "the insulating phase occurs at relatively small values of @xmath19 . in this phase ,",
    "the electron density is constant as a function of @xmath17 , and fixed by the commensurability condition ( one electron per lattice site ) .",
    "one can assign the value @xmath20 to the line of particle - hole symmetry in this phase diagram . deviation from this symmetry line",
    "makes the excitation gap in the insulating phase smaller ; the gap width is a non - analytical function of @xmath17 , reflecting the violation of the particle - hole symmetry at @xmath21 . at a certain critical value of @xmath22 , which depends on @xmath15 , the gap disappears and a transition to a `` conducting '' phase occurs .",
    "this conventional picture is modified somewhat in the one - dimensional case , but qualitatively remains valid .",
    "a similar description applies to mott transitions in bose systems with repulsion@xcite .",
    "the line of particle - hole symmetry in the case of vortices corresponds to a special value @xmath23 of the magnetic field , which induces a vortex lattice commensurate with the period of the junction array .",
    "the analogy to the electronic case described in the last paragraph suggests that the vortex density remains constant in a finite interval of @xmath16 around @xmath23 .",
    "one also expects a gap in the excitation spectrum of the array that diminishes as a function of @xmath24 within the commensurate phase ( which is the analog of the insulating phase ) .",
    "indeed , in the experiment a cusp - like dependence of the resistance activation energy on @xmath24 was observed ( see ref .   and",
    "section[experiment ] of this paper ) . at some critical value of @xmath24",
    "the observed temperature dependence of the resistance becomes considerably weaker .",
    "this may indicate that a transition to a gapless ( `` conducting '' ) phase occurs , accompanied by the creation of discommensuration solitons .    in this paper , we present a quantitative theory of the commensurate - incommensurate transition for a chain of quantum vortices in a quasi - one - dimensional josephson array ( see ref .   for another type of commensurate - incommensurate transition in josephson arrays ) .",
    "the transition to the incommensurate state occurs by proliferation of the discommensuration solitons through the vortex chain .",
    "we are able to develop a theory by analytical means , because of a special feature of the system we consider .",
    "it turns out , that the range of the interaction between the vortices is much longer than the inter - vortex distance .",
    "therefore , the solitons consist of many vortices , and possess a large effective mass .",
    "thus the theory for the commensurate - incommensurate transition is essentially classical . however , to relate the parameters of this theory to the generic properties ( @xmath25 and @xmath1 ) of the josephson array , we need to consider a single vortex as a quantum particle : the amplitude of the periodic pinning potential depends on the bandwidth of the vortex . after that , we are able to find analytically the excitation gap existing in the commensurate phase and the boundaries of this phase in the @xmath26 plane .",
    "we relate the characteristics of the commensurate and incommensurate phases to an observable quantity , the activation energy of the resistance @xmath27 . in the commensurate phase",
    ", the transfer of one flux quantum between the edges of the array occurs via a sequence of solitons propagating through it .",
    "the number of solitons necessary to transfer one vortex is equal to the ratio of the periods of the vortex lattice and the junction array ; typically this ratio is large . at any time during the vortex transfer , there is no more than one soliton present in the chain .",
    "we demonstrate that @xmath27 depends not only on the properties of the `` bulk '' one - dimensional system , but also reflects boundary pinning effects , accompanying the passage of vortices through the ends of the array .",
    "one soliton changes the length of the vortex chain only by one period of the junction array , which is less than the inter - vortex spacing .",
    "hence , in the commensurate phase , the process of vortex flow through the array can be viewed as motion of a rigid vortex chain .",
    "because of the rigidity , the vortex chain can not adjust itself to the boundary pinning potential .",
    "the potentials produced by the two ends of the array add to @xmath27 : the relative phase of these two contributions depends on whether the total flux piercing the junction array equals an integer number of flux quanta .",
    "thus , in the commensurate state , there are two major terms in @xmath27 .",
    "the first term is the activation energy of a soliton , and the second term is the sum of the boundary pinning energies .",
    "this second ( smaller ) term oscillates with the magnetic flux piercing the array . in the incommensurate state , the vortex chain is compressible , and can adjust to the boundaries of the array , if the latter is sufficiently long . as a result ,",
    "the main term in @xmath27 is the boundary pinning potential , which a vortex has to overcome to enter the array .",
    "a correction is provided by the finite compression energy of the chain .",
    "its average value depends on the compressibility of the chain , renormalized by the solitons , and is inversely proportional to the length of the array .",
    "this term oscillates with the flux threading the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ rigid ]",
    ", we introduce a model of classical vortices in the quasi - one - dimensional josephson array . here",
    "we neglect the discreteness of the array , and the screening of the vortex - vortex interaction .",
    "this approximation means that the the vortex chain is entirely incompressible .",
    "we establish the stability criterion for a one - dimensional vortex chain against formation of a zigzag structure .",
    "we calculate the equilibrium number of vortices as a function of the magnetic field and determine the boundary pinning caused by the interaction of the vortices with the ends of the array . for an incompressible chain , this gives us the equilibrium position for each vortex . in the following part , section [ effpinning ] ,",
    "we discuss bulk pinning by reintroducing the discreteness of the junction array .",
    "the array creates a periodic potential for each vortex , which behaves as a quantum particle in this potential .",
    "we demonstrate that typically the amplitude of the quantum fluctuations of a vortex exceeds the period of the array .",
    "( this justifies , in fact , the approximations made in section [ rigid ] ) .",
    "we calculate the residual pinning potential , suppressed by quantum and thermal fluctuations , acting on a single vortex .",
    "the results of the sections [ rigid ] and [ effpinning ] are directly applicable to short arrays , i.e. , arrays that are shorter than the range of the vortex - vortex interaction .",
    "the main goal of these sections though is to provide us with the coefficients necessary to write down the effective hamiltonian describing a compressible chain in a long array .",
    "we start the next section [ compressible ] with an estimate of the vortex - vortex interaction range .",
    "it is defined by two mechanisms : ( 1 ) the effect of the magnetic field induced by the vortices , and ( 2 ) the interaction of the vortices in the josephson array with the abrikosov lattice in the contacts to the array .",
    "the estimate demonstrates that for the conditions of the experiments@xcite the range indeed exceeds greatly the inter - vortex distance , but still may be smaller than the system length , making it necessary to account for a finite compressibility of the vortex chain .",
    "we therefore derive the long - wavelength theory for the compressible vortex chain .",
    "this theory enables us to describe , in section [ phases ] , the commensurate - incommensurate transition .",
    "we determine the boundaries of the commensurate phase , and find the dependence of the activation energy for elementary excitations on the parameters of the system .",
    "also in this section , we discuss the behavior of the resistivity following from the picture we developed .",
    "we compare our results with the existing experiment in section [ experiment ] . using the experimental values of the vortex density at the commensurate - incommensurate transition and the maximum of the activation energy of the resistance",
    ", we are able to give parameter - free estimates of the range of the vortex - vortex interaction and of the elastic constant of the vortex chain .",
    "the effective pinning potential turns out to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the bare potential due to quantum fluctuations ( as calculated in section  [ effpinning ] ) .",
    "the soliton length is extremely large and of the order of the length of the array .",
    "the long - range nature of the vortex - vortex interaction leads to a large value of the elastic constant : the chain is virtually rigid in the incommensurate phase .",
    "our theory explains consistently the main experimental observations reported in in this paper and in ref .  :",
    "( 1 ) the cusp - like dependence of the activation energy on the magnetic field in the commensurate phase ; ( 2 ) the large value of this activation energy ( compared to @xmath1 and @xmath25 ) , and ( 3 ) oscillations of the resistance with the applied magnetic field , with a period corresponding to one flux quantum through the entire array , in the incommensurate phase .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section [ discussion ] .",
    "we consider a two - dimensional josephson array of lattice constant @xmath9 , length @xmath28 and width @xmath29 where @xmath30 , see fig .  [ array ] .",

    ", the proliferation of spontaneous vortices and antivortices through the system destroys the long - range order .",
    "we consider smaller values of @xmath3 , and neglect the existence of spontaneous topological excitations .",

    ", one should find a way to reduce the vortex - vortex interaction strength . that would open new possibilities of experimental investigations of the luttinger liquid which is formed on the incommensurate side of the transition .",
    "the properties of the liquid are expected to depend crucially@xcite on the value of the fractional flux carried by the solitons .",

    "<S> we consider interacting vortices in a quasi - one - dimensional array of josephson junctions with small capacitance . if the charging energy of a junction is of the order of the josephson energy , the fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter in the system are considerable , and the vortices behave as quantum particles . </S>",
    "<S> their density may be tuned by an external magnetic field , and therefore one can control the commensurability of the one - dimensional vortex lattice with the lattice of josephson junctions . we show that the interplay between the quantum nature of a vortex , and the long - range interaction between the vortices leads to the existence of a specific commensurate - incommensurate transition in a one - dimensional vortex lattice . in the commensurate phase an elementary excitation is a soliton , with energy separated from the ground state by a finite gap . </S>",
    "<S> this gap vanishes in the incommensurate phase . </S>",
    "<S> each soliton carries a fraction of a flux quantum ; the propagation of solitons leads to a finite resistance of the array . </S>",
    "<S> we find the dependence of the resistance activation energy on the magnetic field and parameters of the josephson array . </S>",
    "<S> this energy consists of the above - mentioned gap , and also of a boundary pinning term , which is different in the commensurate and incommensurate phases . </S>",
    "<S> the developed theory allows us to explain quantitatively the available experimental data .    2 </S>"
