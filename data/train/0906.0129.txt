    "the internal antarctic plateau is , at present , a site of potential great interest for astronomical applications .",
    "the extreme low temperatures , the dryness , the typical high altitude of the internal antarctic plateau ( more than 2500  m ) , joint to the fact that the optical turbulence seems to be concentrated in a thin surface layer whose thickness is of the order of a few tens of meters do of this site a place in which , potentially , we could achieve astronomical observations otherwise possible only by space . in spite of the exciting first results @xcite the effective gain that astronomers might achieve from ground - based astronomical observation from this location still suffers from serious uncertainties and doubts that have been pointed out in previous work @xcite",
    ". a better estimate of the properties of the optical turbulence above the internal antarctic plateau can be achieved with both dedicated measurements done simultaneously with different instruments and simulations provided by atmospheric models .",
    "simulations offer the advantage to provide volumetric maps of the optical turbulence ( @xmath0 ) extended on the whole internal plateau and , ideally , to retrieve comparative estimates in a relative short time and homogeneous way on different places of the plateau . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "our group performed a detailed analysis of the meteorological parameters from which the optical turbulence depends on , provided by the general circulation model ( gcm ) of the european center for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) . in that work we quantified the accuracy of the ecmwf estimates of all the major meteorological parameters and , at the same time , we pointed out which are the limitations of the gcms . in contexts in which the gcms fail , mesoscale models can supply more accurate information because they are conceived to reconstruct phenomena that develop at a too small spatial and temporal scale to be described by a gcm . in spite of the fact that mesoscale models can attain higher resolution than the gcms ,",
    "some parameters , such as the optical turbulence , are not explicitly resolved but are parameterized , i.e. the fluctuations of the microscopic physical quantities are expressed as a function of the corresponding macroscopic quantities averaged on a larger spatial scale ( cell of the model ) . for classical meteorological parameters the use of a mesoscale model should be useless if gcms such as the one of the ecmwf could provide estimate with equivalent level of accuracy .",
    "for this reason the hagelin et al . paper ( 2008 ) has been a first step towards the exploitation of the mesoscale meso - nh model above the internal antarctic plateau . in that study",
    "we retrieved an exhaustive characterization of all the meteorological parameters from the ecmwf analyses ( wind field , potential temperature , absolute temperature ... ) and , at the same time , we defined the ecmwf s analyses limitations : we concluded that in the first 10 - 20  m , the ecmwf analyses show a discrepancy with respect to measurements of the order of 2 - 3  m.s@xmath3 for the wind speed and of 4 - 5 k for the temperature .",
    "[ fig : oro ]    the meso - nh model has been proven to be reliable in reproducing 3d maps of optical turbulence @xcite and it has been statistically validated @xcite above mid - latitude astronomical sites .",
    "preliminary tests concerning the optimization of the model configuration and sensitivity to the horizontal and the vertical resolution have already been conducted by our team @xcite for the internal antarctic plateau . in this paper",
    "we intend to quantify the performances of the model above this peculiar environment .",
    "more precisely , our goals are :    * to compare the performances of the mesoscale meso - nh model and the ecmwf gcm in reconstructing wind speed and absolute temperature ( main meteorological parameters from which the optical turbulence depends on ) with respect to the measurements .",
    "this analysis will quantify the performances of the meso - nh model with respect to the gcm from the ecmwf . * to perform simulations of the optical turbulence above dome c ( 75@xmath40604``s , 123@xmath42048''e ) employing different model configurations and compare the typical simulated thickness of the surface layers well as the seeing in the free atmosphere with the one measured by @xcite ( hereafter tr2008 ) . in this way we aim to establish which configuration",
    "is necessary to reconstruct correctly the @xmath0 . in summary",
    "we aim to validate the meso - nh model on the antarctic site .    the two issues : ( 1 ) the surface layer thickness @xmath1 and ( 2 ) the typical seeing in the free atmosphere are certainly the two main features that might get this place on the earth extremely appealing for astronomers and it might be extremely useful to have an independent confirmation from models of the typical values measured on the site . this study is focused on the winter season . in section 2",
    "we present the meso - nh model and the different configurations that were used to perform numerical weather simulations above the internal antarctic plateau .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a statistical comparison of standard meteorological parameters ( wind speed and temperature ) deduced from meso - nh simulations , ecmwf analyses and radiosoundings . in section 4",
    "we present the results of the computation with meso - nh of the surface layer thickness for 15 nights in winter time and a comparison with the observed surface layer thickness from tr2008 .",
    "finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "meso - nh @xcite is the non - hydrostatic mesoscale research model developed jointly by mto - france and laboratoire darologie .",
    "it can simulate the temporal evolution of the three - dimensional atmospheric flow over any part the globe .",
    "the prognostic variables forecasted by this model are the three cartesian components of the wind @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , the dry potential temperature @xmath8 , the pressure @xmath9 , the turbulent kinetic energy @xmath10 .",
    "the system of equation is based upon an anelastic formulation allowing for an effective filtering of acoustic waves . a gal - chen and sommerville@xcite",
    "coordinate on the vertical and a c - grid in the formulation of arakawa and messinger@xcite for the spatial digitalization is used .",
    "the temporal scheme is an explicit three - time - level leap - frog scheme with a time filter @xcite .",
    "the turbulent scheme is a one - dimensional 1.5 closure scheme @xcite with the bougeault and lacarrre@xcite mixing length .",
    "the surface exchanges are computed in an externalized surface scheme ( surfex ) including different physical packages , among which isba @xcite for vegetation .",
    "masciadri et al .",
    "( 1999a , b ) implemented the optical turbulence package to be able to forecast also the optical turbulence ( @xmath0 3d maps ) and all the astroclimatic parameters deduced from the @xmath0 .",
    "we will refer to the astro - meso - nh code to indicate this package . to compare simulations with measurements",
    "the integrated astroclimatic parameters are calculated integrating the @xmath0 with respect to the zenith in the astro - meso - nh code .",
    "the parameterization of the optical turbulence and the reliability of the astro - meso - nh model have been proved in successive studies in which simulations have been compared to measurements provided by different instruments @xcite .",
    "this has been achieved thank to a dedicated calibration procedure that has been proposed and validated by the same authors @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric meso - nh model is conceived for research development and for this reason is in constant evolution .",
    "one of the major advantages of meso - nh that was not available at the time of the masciadri s studies is that it allows now for the use of the interactive grid - nesting technique @xcite .",
    "this technique consists in using different imbricated domains with increasing horizontal resolutions with mesh - sizes that can reach 10 meters .",
    "we use in this study the astro - meso - nh package , implemented in the most recent version of the atmospheric meso - nh model . to facilitate the put in the context of this work , the differences that have been implemented in the model configuration with respect to the previous masciadri s studies are listed here :    * a higher vertical resolution near the ground has been selected .",
    "we still work with a logarithmic stretching near the ground up to 3.5  km but we start with a first grid point of 2  m ( instead of 50  m ) with 12 points in the first hundred meters . this configuration has been allowed thanks to the extremely smooth orography of this region of the earth .",
    "it is obviously preferable because it permits to better quantify the turbulence contribution that typically develops in the thin vertical slabs in the first hundred of meters above the internal antarctic plateau .",
    "above 3.5  km the vertical resolution is constant and equal to @xmath11=600  m as well as in masciadri s previous work .",
    "the maximum altitude is 22 kilometers . *",
    "the grid - nesting ( see table  [ tab1 ] ) is implemented with 3 imbricated domains allowing a maximum horizontal resolution of 1  km in a region around the concordia station ( 80  km @xmath12 80  km ) . *",
    "the simulations are forced at synoptic times ( every 6 hours ) by analyses from the ecmwf .",
    "this permits to perform a real forecast of the optical turbulence . to avoid misunderstandings , we highlight indeed that , as it has been extensively explained in previous studies ( masciadri et al .",
    "2004 , masciadri & egner 2006 ) , the meso - nh model has been used so far for simulations of the optical turbulence in a configuration permitting a quantification of the mean optical turbulence during a night and not a forecast of the optical turbulence .",
    "we perform therefore a step ahead with respect to results obtained so far with the astro - meso - nh code .    in spite of the fact that the orographic morphology is almost flat above antarctica",
    ", it is known that even a weak slope can be an important factor to induce a change in the wind speed at the surface in these regions .",
    "the physics of the optical turbulence strongly depend on a delicate balance between the wind speed and temperature gradients . in order to study the sensitivity of the model to the horizontal resolution and to identify",
    "which configuration provides more reliable estimates we performed two sets of simulations with different model configurations .    in the first configuration ( that we will call _ monomodel _ ) we used an horizontal resolution @xmath13=100  km covering the whole antarctic continent ( figure [ fig : oro]a , b and table [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "we selected this configuration because it permits us to discuss , where it is possible , our results with respect to those obtained by @xcite ( hereafter sg2006 ) with the regional atmospheric model mar above the antarctic plateau . in that case , indeed , the authors used this extremely low horizontal resolution that has the advantage to be cheap from a computational point of view .",
    "this model configuration permits fast simulations but it is certainly necessary to verify that it is high enough to correctly resolve the most important features of the optical turbulence near the ground and in the high part of the atmosphere .    .meso - nh model configuration . in the second column",
    "the horizontal resolution @xmath14x , in the third column the number of grid points and in the fourth column the horizontal surface covered by the model domain . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ see_fa ]    again we observed that results are weakly dependent on the temporal range on which the means values are calculated and for this reason we report just the 12 - 16 utc case .",
    "[ fig : corr_see ] shows the correlation between the observed and simulated values for the seeing in the free atmosphere and in the whole atmosphere .",
    "the median of the observed seeing in the free atmosphere for the 15 nights is @xmath15@xmath16 0.3@xmath170.2 arcsec ; the median seeing in the free atmosphere simulated by meso - nh with the high horizontal resolution is @xmath18@xmath16 0.35@xmath170.24 arcsec and with the low horizontal resolution is @xmath18@xmath16 0.42@xmath170.28 arcsec .",
    "both median simulated values ( with low and high resolution ) match the median value obtained with observation within the statistical error even if the high resolution is much better correlated ( relative error of 16@xmath19 , @xmath14@xmath20@xmath160.05 \" ) .",
    "if we look at the total seeing developed on the whole atmosphere it is well visible ( table  [ see_fa ] and fig.[fig : corr_see ] ) that the model overestimates the measurements with both resolutions .",
    "we have a simulated median @xmath21@xmath16 3.58@xmath170.42 arcsec and @xmath22@xmath16 2.29@xmath170.38 arcsec versus an observed median @xmath23@xmath16 1.6@xmath170.2 arcsec .",
    "even if we take into account the more accurate estimates ( high resolution ) we obtain a dispersion simulations / observations @xmath14@xmath24 @xmath25 0.7 arcsec . the excess of optical turbulence reconstructed by the meso - nh model is clearly concentrated in the surface layer .",
    "we can not exclude an underestimate from measurements but there are , at present time , no major elements that lead to this assumption .",
    "we are working , on the contrary , on a paper to explain this discrepancy and overcome this limitation . considering that we proved that the meteorological parameters are well reconstructed by the meso - nh model near the surface ( section 3 ) and that the surface numerical scheme ( interaction soil biosphere atmosphere isba ) responsible of the control of the budget of the turbulent ground / air fluxes has been recently optimized for antarctic applications ( @xcite ) in the context of our project",
    ", we concentrated our attention on the dynamical and optical numerical turbulence schemes .    in terms of comparison with the sg2006 study we note that the latter study indicates a typical underestimated total seeing of 1.16 arcsec with respect to the observed one ( 1.6 arcsec ) .",
    "the discrepancy is smaller from a quantitative point of view ( @xmath14@xmath26@xmath160.45 arcsec ) with respect to what we find and it is in the opposite direction .",
    "the questionable issue in the sg2006 study is that the turbulence kinetic energy provided by sg2006 in the first levels of the mar model is often of the order of 10@xmath27 m@xmath28s@xmath29 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this values is extremely low and it basically indicates no turbulent kinetic energy on the first level of the model and such a condition is contrary to what observed with measurements .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the mar model underestimates the seeing in the surface layer .",
    "we conclude that the meso - nh model , in the present configuration , reconstructs with good statistical reliability the @xmath1 and the seeing in the free atmosphere while shows a tendency in overestimating the strength of the seeing in the surface layer .",
    "the interesting result of this paper is therefore the fact that the most important features for astronomical interest ( the surface layer thickness and the typical seeing in the free atmosphere ) observed with measurements are confirmed with mesoscale atmospherical model .",
    "we note that the this is the first confirmation made by a mesoscale model of the typical seeing in the free atmosphere . besides it is worth to highlight that these are the first @xmath2 simulations ever done above the internal antarctic plateau and extended all along the whole atmosphere .",
    "figure  [ see_free ] shows the temporal evolution of the @xmath2 profile in the free atmosphere ( more precisely in the ( 1,12 ) km vertical slab ) related to three selected nights in the sample of the 15 simulated nights . in all of the three nights",
    "it is well visible that , even at such high altitudes , the model is active and the vertical distribution of the optical turbulence changes in time with a not negligible dynamic from a quantitative point of view .",
    "the @xmath2 values extend , indeed , on the logarithmic scale ( -18,-16.5 ) . in all the 3 cases it appears clearly that the high - horizontal resolution provides a better temporal variability as expected .",
    "these results are therefore very promising in terms of predictions of the @xmath2 3d maps on long time scales .",
    "[ see_free ]",
    "in this paper we study the performances of the meso - nh mesoscale meteorological model in reconstructing meteorological parameters ( wind speed and temperatures ) as well as the optical turbulence above concordia station in the dome c area , a site in the internal antarctic plateau .",
    "this is , at our knowledge , the first study concerning the optical turbulence reconstructed with an atmospherical mesoscale model above antarctica on the whole atmosphere .",
    "this study is concentrated on the winter season i.e. the most interesting for stellar astronomical applications .",
    "the validation of the model for the meteorological parameters has been done comparing measurements ( radiosoundings ) and simulations on a sample of 47 nights .",
    "the validation of the model for the optical turbulence has been done comparing simulations with measurements on a sample of 15 nights .",
    "two different model configurations were tested : monomodel simulations using a low horizontal resolution ( @xmath13=100  km ) and grid - nesting simulations with high horizontal resolution ( @xmath13=1  km for the innermost domain ) .",
    "the low resolution model permitted us to discuss the results obtained previously in the literature .",
    "the observations used for the validation are , for the meteorological parameters , the analyses from the ecmwf global circulation model and radiosoundings ( 47 nights ) and , for the optical turbulence , the @xmath2 and seeing values ( 15 nights ) measured in situ ( trinquet et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the main conclusions of this study are :    * we showed that near the surface , meso - nh retrieved better wind speed vertical gradient ( wind shear ) than the ecmwf analyses from a qualitative as well as quantitative point of view , thanks to the use of a highest vertical resolution .",
    "we expect therefore a better reconstruction of the katabatic winds typical of these regions by the meso - nh model than the gcm models .",
    "also meso - nh better reconstructs the thermal stability near the surface than the gcms .",
    "the analysis of the first vertical grid point permits us to conclude that the meso - nh model surface temperature is closest to the observations @xmath14t@xmath30@xmath161.60 k than the ecmwf general circulation model ( @xmath14t@xmath31@xmath163.74 k ) which is too warm .",
    "the improvement for the estimate of the wind speed is even more evident ( @xmath14v@xmath30@xmath16 0.04  m.s@xmath3 versus @xmath14v@xmath31@xmath16 2.49  m.s@xmath3 ) .",
    "+ * for what concerns the parameters concerning the optical turbulence , again the results are resolution dependent .",
    "the simulations with low resolution provides a too thick surface layer ( almost double of the observed one ) while those with high resolution provide a mean h@xmath32@xmath1648.9@xmath177.6  m versus an equivalent observed h@xmath33@xmath1635.3@xmath175.1  m. taking into account the statistical error we observe that the high horizontal mode provides a surface layer thickness that is statistically just 6 m higher than the observed one but within the dispersion @xmath34 of the observations . +",
    "* the integral of the @xmath2 above the h@xmath35 i.e. the seeing in the free atmosphere @xmath15@xmath16 0.3@xmath170.20 arcsec is reconstructed with an excellent level of reliability ( @xmath14@xmath24@xmath160.05 arcsec ) by the model used with the high resolution configuration @xmath18@xmath16 0.35@xmath170.24 arcsec .",
    "the low resolution provides a worse estimate even if within the @xmath34 of the observations . +",
    "* the model still shows a tendency in overestimating the turbulence in the surface layer .",
    "for an observed @xmath23@xmath16 1.6 arcsec we have a simulated @xmath36@xmath16 2.29 arcsec with the model in high horizontal resolution mode .",
    "this is the subject of an on - going study conceived to answer to this open question . + * the results concerning the computation of the mean thickness of the surface layer as well as the seeing in different vertical slabs are not very dependent of the time interval used to average it .",
    "this widely simplifies the analysis of simulations .",
    "+ * estimates obtained with the grid - nested simulations are closer to the observations than those obtained with monomodel simulations .",
    "this study highlighted the necessity of the use of high horizontal resolution to reconstruct a good meteorological field as well as the parameters characterizing the optical turbulence in antarctica , even if the orography is almost flat over the internal antarctic plateau .",
    "the employment of the low resolution ( 100 km ) alone can hardly be used to identify _ the best site on the antarctic plateau_. however , it can be used to identify rapidly , on the whole antarctic plateau , the most interesting regions in which to focus , successively , simulations at high horizontal resolutions on smaller surfaces domains . with `` the most interesting regions '' we mean those with the lowest surface layer thickness for example .",
    "+ * the meso - nh model is able to reconstruct a mean @xmath2 profile well fitting the vertical optical turbulence distribution measured in the first 20 km from the ground .",
    "the model also shows a not negligible temporal variability in the whole 20 km from the ground in a very small dynamic range .",
    "the latter is to be considered a very interesting feature because it is known that this is a region of the atmosphere in which in general the mesoscale models are less sensible than near the ground .",
    "it is therefore a further indication that the meso - nh model is well placed to forecast the turbulence evolution at these time scales .",
    "+    once the tendency in overestimating the strength of the turbulence in the surface layer will be solved ( forthcoming paper ) we plan to run the meso - nh model in other regions of the internal antarctic plateau to identify the best locations for astronomical observations i.e. the places with the best turbulence characteristics from an astronomical point of view .",
