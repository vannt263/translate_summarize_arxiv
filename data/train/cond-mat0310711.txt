    "epitaxial growth of germanium on the si(001 ) surface has been an active area of investigation because it represents a versatile way of fabricating quantum dots . at the same time",
    ", ge / si(001 ) provides an example of a system where the mismatch strain can be used to control the morphological features of the surface . in the early stages of growth ,",
    "the surface changes its reconstruction from the @xmath0 structure to a @xmath1 pattern , which consists of an array of long , parallel lines of dimer vacancies .",
    "it has recently been shown that the @xmath1 reconstruction can be an excellent template for the nanofabrication of 1-dimensional structures with unique electronic transport behavior @xcite . at later stages of growth ,",
    "the film breaks up into pyramidal islands ( quantum dots ) ; controlling the size , spatial distribution and electronic properties of these quantum dots represent key issues for the practical applications of the heteroepitaxial growth on si(001 ) . from a fundamental point of view , the current state - of - the - art in scanning tunnelling microscopy has helped renew the general interest in the @xmath1 structures on si(001 ) .",
    "for example , rastelli and coworkers @xcite have recently discovered that the @xmath1 reconstruction on the ge - covered si(001 ) surface disappears upon si capping , confirming in an ingenious way the role played by the mismatch strain in determining the stability of the vacancy lines . in another recent study @xcite , sutter _",
    "et al . _ have used high - resolution stm imaging in conjunction with a detailed statistical analysis of morphological features of the surface to establish that the interactions between steps and vacancy lines cause the initial surface roughening of the ge / si(001 ) .",
    "rapid progress has been made after the discovery of the @xmath2 structure @xcite , and two authoritative reviews summarizing the present understanding of the growth of germanium films on si(001 ) have been published @xcite .",
    "dimer vacancies ( dvs ) form easily on the si(001 ) surface , but they only organize into vacancy lines ( vls ) when there is a sufficient amount of germanium deposited ( close to 1 ml ) . the mismatch strain created by epitaxial deposition increases the number of dimer vacancies per unit area , and the interactions between these vacancies become important at sufficiently high vacancy concentrations .",
    "the interaction between two dvs is long - range repulsive when the dv s belong to the same dimer row , but weakly attractive when they belong to adjacent dimer rows @xcite .",
    "such anisotropy of the interactions determines the alignment of the dvs in the direction perpendicular to the dimer rows .",
    "this physical picture for the origin of the @xmath3 reconstruction has emerged from the experimental work of chen _ et al .",
    "the mechanism for the formation of vacancy lines is consistent not only with experiments done on other epitaxial systems ( e.g. , bi / si(001 ) @xcite ) , but also with the observations of the si(001 ) surface with metal impurities such as ag @xcite or ni @xcite .",
    "while the physical origin of the vacancy lines on si(001 ) has been elucidated @xcite , it remains a puzzle as to why vacancy lines are not normally observed on the very similar ge(001 ) surface .",
    "the fact that the ge(001 ) surface is virtually defect free @xcite suggests that the formation energy of the vacancies on ge(001 ) is substantially larger than that of the vacancies on si(001 ) .",
    "quantitative data from atomic - scale calculations on the ge system is not available , although the need for such calculations was emphasized almost a decade ago in the work of yang _",
    "the purpose of our paper is to address the differences between ge(001 ) and si(001 ) concerning the formation of dimer - vacancies and their self - assembly into vacancy lines .",
    "the work presented here fits well into the current efforts @xcite for explaining the differences between the two technologically important surfaces .",
    "we have calculated the formation energies of point and line defects on the ( 001 ) surfaces and their dependence on applied strain , using empirical potential @xcite models for interactions .",
    "the results obtained offer an explanation for the differences between the vacancies on si(001 ) and ge(001 ) and are consistent with experimental findings ; moreover , these results could foster further work based on more accurate descriptions of the atomic interactions such as tight - binding or density functionals .",
    "we have considered both the heteroepitaxial system ge / si(001 ) for different values of ge coverage , as well as pure si and ge surfaces under external strain . while the results concerning the epitaxial ge / si(001 ) systems have been previously obtained in different forms @xcite , the variation of the energetic parameters of dvs and vls on the ( 001 ) surface with applied strains has not been systematically addressed in the past .",
    "such a study of the energetics of defects on ( 001 ) surfaces as a function of applied strain is presented here .",
    "the new results obtained in this paper are : + ( a ) the formation energy of the dimer - vacancies on ge(001 ) and its decrease under compressive , biaxial strains . in the case of unstrained surfaces , we have found that the formation energy for single dv on ge(001 ) is three times larger than the corresponding value for the single dv on si(001 ) .",
    "therefore , in order for the formation energy of a single - dv on ge(001 ) to become negative , a large compressive strain should be applied , either biaxially or in the direction of the dimer rows .",
    "+ ( b ) the formation energy of vacancy lines on si(001 ) and ge(001 ) as a function of applied strain . using a simple model based on the interactions of nearest - neighbor vacancies in a vl , we have also identified the formation energy of a single dv and the attractive interaction ( binding ) between two dvs in adjacent dimer - rows as the dominant contributions to the formation energy of a vl .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline the competition between the formation energy of the vacancy lines and their elastic interactions as the general energetic mechanism that leads to the appearance of the @xmath2 reconstructions .",
    "in contrast to previous interpretations @xcite , we have found that there is no long range attraction between the vacancy lines , as their interactions are purely repulsive . as in most other studies to date , the formation of vacancy lines is regarded here as a purely thermodynamic phenomenon , thus the kinetics concerning the diffusion of vacancies during their alignment are not considered . in section 3",
    "we describe the computational details of the total energy calculations based on tersoff potentials @xcite .",
    "the next two sections are devoted to the formation energies and repulsion strengths for single - vacancy lines ( vls ) on ge - covered si(001 ) ( section 4 ) and for different types of vls on pure si(001 ) and ge(001 ) ( section 5 ) .",
    "we investigate the formation energies of individual dimer vacancies on ( 001 ) surfaces and their strain dependence , identifying the differences between the defects on si and ge surfaces .",
    "the possible relevance of these results for future experimental work is also discussed in section 5 .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section 6 .",
    "the @xmath1 reconstruction is a structural pattern on the ( 001 ) surface of si , characterized by the periodic lengths @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a positive integer and @xmath7  is the lattice constant of the unreconstructed si(001 ) surface .",
    "this reconstruction is obtained by eliminating every @xmath6-th dimer from each dimer row , such that the dimer vacancies created in this manner are in registry with one another and form straight lines perpendicular to the dimer rows . to lower the number of dangling bonds at the surface , the second - layer atoms below the dimer vacancy rebond such that they are fully coordinated , at the cost of introducing some surface stress @xcite .",
    "depending on the preparation details of the surface , other types of atomic structures of vls can be obtained @xcite . in this section",
    "we focus on the general features of the energetics of the @xmath1 surface , without reference to a specific atomic structure .",
    "we start by partitioning the surface energy into a contribution from the @xmath0 surface and a contribution from the vacancy lines : @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the surface energies of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively , @xmath11 is the energy per unit length of the vacancy lines , and @xmath12 is the density of lines in a periodic array of vls with a spacing of @xmath13 .",
    "( [ ledge ] ) defines the energy per unit length @xmath11 of the vacancy lines as an excess energy with respect to the defect - free @xmath0 surface .",
    "we note that the energy of the vacancy lines @xmath11 includes the formation energy of the lines , as well as their elastic interactions .",
    "guided by the early work of marchenko and parshin @xcite , we expect the interactions to be inversely proportional with the square of the separation between vls , so that the line energy @xmath11 can be written as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the formation energy of a vl and @xmath16 is the strength of the repulsion between lines .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath17 arises since we treat a periodic array of line defects @xcite , rather than two isolated vls . using eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) in ( [ ledge ] ) we can write the surface energy of the @xmath18 reconstruction as a function of @xmath6 : @xmath19 where we have used the fact that @xmath20 .    analyzing eq .",

    "the following two sections are devoted to the computation of the line formation energies and repulsion strengths for various vl structures , and to the investigation of the behavior of these quantities as a function of germanium coverage and applied strain .",
    "before we proceed with the numerical results , we draw a connection with previous work on the energetics of the @xmath1 surface .",
    "the above theory of the energetics of the vacancy lines is similar to refs .",
    "@xcite , since it explicitly considers the competition between the ( negative ) formation energy of a vl and the repulsive ( positive ) interaction between the vls as the physical origin of the @xmath1 structure . in ref .",
    "@xcite however , the emphasis falls on the surface stress anisotropy , and the treatment of the two - domain ( i.e. @xmath1 and @xmath28 ) surfaces obliterates the simplicity of the vl energetics outlined above .",
    "a word of caution is due concerning the mechanisms of formation of the @xmath1 reconstruction proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and in the review article @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the conclusions based on the energetic competition between `` trench formation '' and `` strain relaxation '' are fortuitous , since the @xmath6-dependence of each of these two energetic contributions is incorrect .",
    "reconstruction is described by eq .",
    "( [ gamma_of_n ] ) . ]",
    "the sign of the `` trench energy '' and the magnitudes of the two energetic contributions are also incorrect , though these aspects are probably outside the scope of the simple frenkel - kontorova model used in @xcite .",
    "@xcite asserts that `` in the dimer - row direction the vl - vl interaction is short - range repulsive and long - range attractive '' , which seems plausible given the behavior of the @xmath9 in the limit of large @xmath6 .",
    "however , we note that what appears to be an attractive long - range interaction between vls is in fact the formation energy of one vl per unit cell of the @xmath1 surface .",
    "as shown in the sections to follow , the vl - vl interaction takes a purely repulsive form once the vacancy line energy is extracted from the surface energy .",
    "in the terminology of ref .",
    "@xcite , the vacancy lines considered here are made of 1-dv , 2-dv and 1 + 2-dvs , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - dvstructures ] .",
    "the choice of these structures is motivated by the experimental observations of the atomic - scale details of vacancy lines on different surfaces : the 1-dv structure is present on ge - covered si(001 ) @xcite , while lines with the 2-dv and 1 + 2-dv configurations have been observed on si(001 ) with ni @xcite and ag @xcite impurities , as well as on radiation - quenched si(001 ) @xcite .",
    "accurate calculations of the long - range behavior of the vl - vl interactions are very demanding , requiring slabs that are both long ( @xmath29 ) and thick ( at least 10 layers ) .",
    "earlier density - functional and tight - binding calculations were restricted to thin slabs with 46 moving layers , due to limitations in computational power @xcite . at present ,",
    "density - functional and tight - binding calculations have become possible @xcite , though they remain computationally expensive for the purpose of determining the long - range interactions between line defects .",
    "such calculations are still prohibitive for point defects on the surface , since these defects require simulation cells that are large in all three directions . as more studies",
    "would probably become available for various types of vacancy lines in the near future , it is worth pointing out that a good test for their total - energy convergence is to check that the line energies @xmath11 can be fitted well with the inverse - square power law given by eq .",
    "( [ fit ] ) .",
    "such a test would also indicate whether or not the chosen thickness of the computational slab is sufficient .",
    "this type of analysis is routinely performed for steps on crystal surfaces ( see @xcite and references therein ) in order to determine the step formation energy and step - step interactions , but it has almost never been applied to the case of vacancy lines .",
    "since we will investigate vacancy lines as well as individual vacancies ( point defects ) on the surface , we employ empirical potentials to model the atomic interactions .",
    "we use the tersoff potential for si and ge @xcite , since it satisfactorily describes the structure and energetics of steps on ( 001 ) surfaces @xcite , as well as the surface energies of the @xmath1 reconstructions @xcite . despite known limitations ,",
    "the empirical potential described in @xcite represents a widely accepted standard for si - ge systems with large numbers of atoms .",
    "our aim is restricted to a meaningful comparison ( rather than an accurate determination ) of the properties of dimer vacancies on si(001 ) and ge(001 ) . for this purpose ,",
    "the use of the tersoff potential is appropriate , and even desirable as a starting point .    for simulation cells with a thickness of @xmath30  and values of @xmath6 in the range @xmath31 ,",

    "for the case of two atomic species in the simulation cell , the surface energy is given by : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) are the number of atoms and chemical potential of ge ( si ) .",

    ", discrepancies between the binding energies @xmath46 listed in table  [ table - uw ] and the ones reported experimentally are expected .",

    "the differences between the line formation energies shown in the last two columns of table  [ table - uw ] are due to the presence of interactions between a given vacancy with higher - order neighbors in the same vl , which are neglected in formula ( [ binding ] ) . while such effects could be considered small , note from table  [ table - uw ] that they systematically lead to a lowering of the formation energy of vacancy lines below the estimate given by ( [ binding ] ) .",

    "focusing on single dvs , we compare the _ formation energy per vacancy _ for isolated vacancies , bound pairs and vacancy lines under biaxial strain .",
    "this comparison is performed separately for the case of si and ge surfaces .",
    "the results plotted in fig .  [ fig - onedv ] which show that the formation energy per dv , to a good approximation , is a linear function of strain for strains in the range -2%2% .",

    "we can now identify the difference between dvs on si(001 ) and ge(001 ) . from table",
    "[ table - uw ] note that the formation energy @xmath56 of a single dv is positive both for ge(001 ) and si(001 ) , but in the case of ge(001 ) it is about 3 times higher than that of an isolated dv on si(001 ) .",
    "therefore , in the absence of any kinetic effects , a compressive strain of @xmath64 would be required to create stable dvs ( @xmath65 ) on si(001 ) , which is readily achievable as result of quenching @xcite .",

    "[ fig - onedv ] , when dvs are part of a bound pair the compression at which the formation energy per dv becomes negative decreases due to the attractive interaction between dvs : for si(001 ) the critical compression becomes @xmath67 , while for dvs on ge(001 ) it remains rather large , @xmath68 .    based on these results ( fig .",
    "[ fig - onedv ] ) , we propose that organization of the dvs into vacancy lines on ge(001 ) could be observed provided that the surface is under compressive strains of @xmath69 .",
    "biaxial strains are somewhat difficult to apply and control accurately in practice . a simple way to provide some compression",
    "would be quenching , as done in @xcite .",
    "as far as lowering the formation energy of dvs is concerned , uniaxial strains along the dimer row direction are more efficient than biaxial deformations .",
    "therefore , the use of ultraflat , single - domain surfaces under uniaxial compression along the dimer row can lead to observations of vacancies organizing into lines on ge(001 ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have performed an investigation of the vls and dvs on strained si(001 ) and ge(001 ) .",
    "we have found that the dimer - vacancies on the two surfaces exhibit differences in terms of the formation energy , their strain sensitivity , and the binding energy of two dvs in adjacent dimer rows . with the present model of atomic interactions @xcite ,",
    "each of these energetic parameters appear to favor the self - organization of dvs into vacancy lines on si(001 ) , but not on the ge(001 ) surface .",
    "the most important difference concerns the formation energy of single dvs , which was found to be 0.55 ev for ge(001 ) , but only 0.19 ev in the case of si(001 ) .",
    "the formation energy difference between single dvs on si and ge surfaces seems robust with respect to the empirical potential used : we have recalculated these energies with the stillinger - weber model @xcite , and found similar results , though the difference between the two formation energies predicted by the stillinger - weber potential was larger .",
    "this finding can not be explained by scaling the dv formation energies with the bulk cohesive energy ( or melting temperature ) of si and ge .",
    "rather , it could likely be due to subtle details in the relaxation of the atoms that surround the vacancy , particularly to the interplay between the lateral and vertical relaxation ; further studies are underway in order to elucidate this point . while it is well known that the stability of dvs on ( 001 ) surfaces is strongly enhanced by kinetic effects ( i.e. two atoms are unlikely to find the dv and fill it at the same time @xcite ) , it is conceivable that the large gap between the formation energies of dvs on si(001 ) and ge(001 ) determines their different physical behavior .",
    "based on studies of how the formation energy varies with external strains , we have proposed that the self - assembly of vacancies on clean ge(001 ) would be possible if compressive strains are applied either biaxially or along the dimer row direction .",
    "pending an increase in the available computational power and methodologies , the results of this article warrant future studies using higher - level total - energy methods such as tight - binding or density functional calculations .",
    "the use of such methods is expected to bring quantitative improvements of the energetic properties computed here .",
    "furthermore , higher - level methods can also address other important aspects of the self - assembly of vacancies such as the energetic barriers associated with the creation and diffusion of dvs on si(001 ) and ge(001 ) .",
    "future investigations regarding the kinetics of dimer vacancies would be invaluable for fully elucidating the differences between si(001 ) and ge(001 ) .",
