    "stephan s quintet ( sq , hgc 92 , arp 319 , vv 288 ) is one of the first known ( stephan 1877 ) and best studied of the hickson 1982 catalog of very compact groups of galaxies , and historically the most mysterious .",
    "the group consists of the trio ngc 7319 , ngc 7318a , and ngc 7317 , all of which have redshift 0.022 , ngc 7318b with redshift 0.019 closely aligned with ngc 7318a , and ngc 7320 .",
    "burbidge and burbidge 1959 noted that the large discrepancy of redshifts for the double galaxy ngc 7318ab requires huge mass / light ( @xmath3 ) ratios @xmath4 from dynamical models to achieve virial equilibrium .",
    "however , the true mystery of sq began when the missing redshift for ngc 7320 was determined by burbidge and burbidge 1961 to be only @xmath5 , with relative velocity @xmath6 m / s compared to @xmath7 for the trio .",
    "for virial equilibrium , this increases the kinetic energy of the group by a factor @xmath8 and would require @xmath9 : much too large to be credible .",
    "thus it was concluded @xcite that the system is in a state of explosive expansion since the @xmath10 @xmath11 chance of ngc 7320 not being a member of the group but a random foreground galaxy is about 1/1500 .",
    "another possibility is that the sq red shifts are intrinsically variable because the sq galaxies were all recently ejected from a nearby parent agn .",
    "arp 1973 summarizes several papers from 1970 - 1972 where he concludes that the nearby large spiral galaxy ngc 7331 has ejected all the sq galaxies and some have intrinsic red shifts , so that all the sq galaxies are located at the same @xmath12 mpc distance of their parent ngc 7331 .",
    "arp has noted numerous cases where galaxies in close angular proximity have not only widely different red shifts but coincident spin magnitudes and alignments with the agn jets , consistent with his hypothesis that galaxies and quasars can be ejected from active galactic nuclei ( agns ) with intrinsic red shifts @xcite .",
    "galaxies and quasars frequently show evidence of ejection with intrinsic red shifts @xcite . a seyfert 1 galaxy ( ngc 6212 ) is observed closely surrounded by a large number ( @xmath1344 ) of qsos that it may have ejected @xcite , with qso surface densities ( 69 per square degree ) larger than ambient by estimated factors of 30 to 10 and decreasing ( to 17 ) with angular distance for radii 10@xmath1450 minutes .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the big bang hypothesis itself may be questioned based on the remarkable accumulation of such coincidences that are contrary to the statistics of standard cdm hierarchical galaxy clustering cosmology ( cdmhcc ) and the hubble red - shift radial - velocity relationship ( @xmath15 ) of big bang cosmology .",
    "the contradictions and mysteries vanish concerning sq anomalous red - shifts and large qso densities near agns when the observations are interpreted using the hydro - gravitational - theory ( hgt ) of gibson 1996 - 2000 . from hgt cosmology such improbable coincidences ( from cdmhcc )",
    "are simply fossil manifestations of the viscous - gravitational beginnings of galaxy clusters and galaxies , where the apparent close proximity is an optical illusion resulting from the small transverse velocities of the galaxies due to early friction as they gently fragmented gravitationally from the same proto - supercluster .",
    "thus , dense angular galaxy clusters can have wide spatial separations precisely along a line of sight from the uniform expansion of space expected from big bang cosmology . from the large range of redshifts ( 0.03 to 2.6 ) and hubble distances ( 150 to 3730 mpc ) of the ngc 6212-quasar system @xcite",
    "the observed agn - qso galaxies are concentrated in a thin ( @xmath16150/1 ) line - of - sight pencil , contradicting cdmhcc and supporting hgt .",
    "hgt has recently been reviewed and compared to data @xcite , so in the following we present only a brief summary .",
    "standard cdmhc cosmologies are based on over - simplified fluid mechanical equations , an inappropriate assumption that the fluid is collisionless , and a recognized `` swindle '' required to achieve solution of the equations .",
    "the jeans 1902 theory neglects viscous forces , turbulence forces , non - acoustic density fluctuations , particle collisions , and the effects of diffusion on gravitational structure formation .",
    "jeans did linear perturbation stability analysis ( neglecting turbulence ) of euler s equations ( neglecting viscous forces ) for a nearly uniform ideal gas with density @xmath17 only a function of pressure ( the barotropic assumption ) , which reduced the problem of gravitational instability to the solvable equation of gravitational acoustics . to reconcile his equations with the linearized collisionless boltzmann s equations and the resulting poisson s equation for the gravitational potential , jeans assumed the density @xmath17 was zero .",
    "this assumption is appropriately known as the `` jeans swindle '' .",
    "the only critical wave length for gravitational stability with all these questionable assumptions is the jeans length scale @xmath18 where @xmath19 @xmath20 is newton s gravitational constant and @xmath21 is the sound speed .",
    "density fluctuations in fluids are not barotropic as assumed by jeans 1902 except rarely in small regions for short times near powerful sound sources .",
    "density fluctuations that triggered the first gravitational structures in the primordial fluids of interest were likely non - acoustic ( non - barotropic ) density variations from turbulent mixing of temperature or chemical species concentrations produced by the big bang @xcite as shown by turbulent signatures in the cosmic microwave background temperature anisotropies @xcite . from jeans theory without jeans swindle ,",
    "a gravitational condensation on an acoustical density maximum rapidly becomes a non - acoustical density maximum because the gravitationally accreted mass retains the ( zero ) momentum of the motionless ambient gas .    without viscous and turbulent forces or diffusion , fluids with non - acoustic density fluctuations",
    "are absolutely unstable to the formation of structure due to self gravity @xcite .",
    "turbulence or viscous forces can dominate gravitational forces at small distances from a point of maximum or minimum density to prevent gravitational structure formation , but gravitational forces will dominate turbulent or viscous forces at larger distances to cause structures if the gas or plasma does not diffuse away faster than it can condense or rarify due to gravity .",
    "the concepts of pressure support and thermal support are artifacts of the erroneous jeans criterion for gravitational instability .",
    "pressure forces can not prevent gravitational structure formation in the plasma epoch because pressures equilibrate in time periods smaller that the gravitational free fall time @xmath22 on length scales smaller than the jeans scale , and the jeans scale in the primordial plasma is larger than the hubble scale of causal connection @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is light speed and @xmath25 is time .",
    "therefore , if gravitational forces exceed viscous and turbulence forces in the plasma epoch at scales smaller than @xmath26 then gravitational structures will develop , independent of the jeans criterion .",
    "only a very large diffusivity of the plasma ( @xmath27 ) could interfere .",
    "the diffusion velocity is @xmath28 for diffusivity @xmath29 at distance @xmath30 and the gravitational velocity is @xmath31 .",
    "the two velocities are equal at the diffusive schwarz length scale @xmath32^{1/4}.\\ ] ] thus very weakly collisional particles such as the hypothetical cold - dark - matter ( cdm ) material can not form potential wells for baryonic matter collection because the particles have large diffusivity and will disperse , consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "diffusivity @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the particle speed and @xmath35 is the collision distance . because weakly collisional particles have large collision distances with large diffusive schwarz lengths the non - baryonic dark matter ( possibly neutrinos )",
    "is the last material to fragment by self gravity and not the first as assumed by cdm cosmologies .",
    "the first structures occur as proto - supercluster - voids in the baryonic plasma controlled by viscous and weak turbulence forces , independent of diffusivity ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "the cdm seeds postulated as the basis of cdmhcc never happened because @xmath37 in the plasma epoch .",
    "the baryonic matter is subject to large viscous forces , especially in the hot primordial plasma and gas states existing when most gravitational structures first formed .",
    "the viscous forces per unit volume @xmath38 dominate gravitational forces @xmath39 at small scales , where @xmath40 is the kinematic viscosity and @xmath41 is the rate of strain of the fluid .",
    "the forces match at the viscous schwarz length @xmath42 which is the smallest size for self gravitational condensation or void formation in such a flow .",
    "turbulent forces may require even larger scales of gravitational structures .",
    "turbulent forces @xmath43 match gravitational forces at the turbulent schwarz scale @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the viscous dissipation rate of the turbulence .",
    "because in the primordial plasma the viscosity and diffusivity are identical and the rate - of - strain @xmath41 is larger than the free - fall frequency @xmath46 , the viscous and turbulent schwarz scales @xmath47 and @xmath48 will be larger than the diffusive schwarz scale @xmath49 , from ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) .",
    "therefore , the criterion for structure formation in the plasma epoch is that both @xmath47 and @xmath48 become less than the horizon scale @xmath23 .",
    "reynolds numbers in the plasma epoch were near critical , with @xmath50 . from @xmath51 and ( 3 ) ,",
    "gravitational structures first formed when @xmath52 at time @xmath53 seconds @xcite , well before @xmath54 seconds which is the time of plasma to gas transition ( 300,000 years ) . because the expansion of the universe inhibited condensation but enhanced void formation in the weakly turbulent plasma , the first structures were proto - supercluster - voids . at @xmath55 s @xmath56 where @xmath49 applies to the non - baryonic component and @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath57 apply to the baryonic component .    as proto - supercluster fragments formed the voids filled with non - baryonic matter by diffusion , inhibiting further structure formation by decreasing the gravitational driving force . the baryonic mass density @xmath58 kg/@xmath59 and rate of strain @xmath60 @xmath61 were preserved as hydrodynamic fossils within the proto - supercluster fragments and within proto - cluster and proto - galaxy objects resulting from subsequent fragmentation as the photon viscosity and @xmath47 decreased prior to the plasma - gas transition and photon decoupling @xcite . as shown in eq .",
    "5 , the kolmogorov scale @xmath62^{1/4}$ ] and the viscous and turbulent schwarz scales at the time of first structure nearly matched the horizon scale @xmath63 m , freezing in the density , strain - rate , and spin magnitudes and directions of the subsequent proto - cluster and proto - galaxy fragments of proto - superclusters .",
    "remnants of the strain - rate and spin magnitudes and directions of the weak turbulence at the time of first structure formation are forms of fossil vorticity turbulence @xcite . thus , hgt explains galaxy spin alignments and close angular associations with quasars without assuming intrinsic red shifts and mutual ejections .",
    "the quiet condition of the primordial gas is revealed by measurements of temperature fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background radiation that show an average @xmath64 much too small for any turbulence to have existed at that time of plasma - gas transition ( @xmath54 s ) .",
    "turbulent plasma motions are strongly damped by buoyancy forces at horizon scales after the first gravitational fragmentation time @xmath55 s. viscous forces in the plasma are inadequate to explain the lack of primordial turbulence ( @xmath40 @xmath65 m@xmath66 s@xmath67 is required but , after @xmath55 s , @xmath68 , gibson 2000 ) .",
    "thus the observed lack of plasma turbulence proves that large scale buoyancy forces and gravitational structure formation must have begun in the plasma epoch .",
    "the gas temperature , density , viscosity , and rate of strain are all precisely known at transition , so the gas viscous schwarz mass @xmath69 is easily calculated to be about @xmath1 kg , the mass of a small planet , or about @xmath70 , with uncertainty about a factor of ten . from hgt , soon after the cooling primordial plasma turned to gas at @xmath54 s ( 300,000 yr ) , the entire baryonic universe condensed to a fog of planetary - mass primordial - fog - particles ( pfps ) .",
    "these gas - cloud objects gradually cooled , formed h - he rain , and eventually froze solid to become the baryonic dark matter and the basic material of construction for stars and everything else , about @xmath71 rogue planets per star .",
    "the jeans mass @xmath72 of the primordial gas at transition was about @xmath73 with about a factor of ten uncertainty , the mass of a globular star cluster .",
    "proto - galaxies fragmented at the pfp scale but also at this proto - globular - star - cluster pgc scale @xmath18 , although not for the reason given by the jeans 1902 theory .",
    "density fluctuations in the gaseous proto - galaxies were absolutely unstable to void formation at all scales larger than the viscous schwarz scale @xmath47 .",
    "pressure can only remain in equilibrium with density without temperature changes in a gravitationally expanding void on scales smaller than the jeans scale . from the second law of thermodynamics",
    ", rarefaction wave speeds that develop as density minima expand due to gravity to form voids are limited to speeds less than the sonic velocity .",
    "cooling would therefore occur and be compensated by radiation in the otherwise isothermal primordial gas when the expanding voids approached the jeans scale . gravitational fragmentation of proto - galaxies will then be accelerated by radiative heat transfer to these cooler regions , resulting in fragmentation at the jeans scale and isolation of proto - globular - star - clusters ( pgcs ) with the primordial - gas - jeans - mass .",
    "these @xmath2 kg pgc objects were not able to collapse from their own self gravity because of their internal fragmentation at the viscous schwarz scale to form @xmath1 kg pfps .",
    "the fact that globular star clusters have precisely the same density and primordial - gas - jeans - mass from galaxy to galaxy proves they were all formed simultaneously soon after the time of the plasma to gas transition @xmath54 s. the gas has never been so uniform since , and no mechanism exists to recover such a high density , let alone such a high uniform density , as the fossil turbulent density value @xmath74 kg/@xmath75 .",
    "young globular cluster formation in bdm halos in the tadpole , mice , and antennae galaxy mergers show that dark pgc clusters of pfps are remarkably stable structures , persisting without disruption or star formation for more than ten billion years .",
    "moles et al . 1997 summarize the data and dynamical status of sq consistent with standard cdmhc cosmology , proposing that the nearby ngc 7320c with @xmath76 m / s ( matching that of ngc 7318b ) has possibly collided several times with sq members stripping their gas and central stars to form luminous wakes and to preserve their dynamical equilibrium , thus accounting for the fact that 43 of the 100 members of the hickson 1982 catalog of compact groups contain discordant redshift members",
    ". however , gallagher et al .",
    "2001 show from their hubble space telescope ( hst ) measurements that globular star clusters in sq are not concentrated in the inner regions of the galaxies as observed in numerous merger remnants , but are spread over the sq debris and surrounding area .",
    "we see no evidence of collisions or mergers in the hst images of sq and suggest the luminous wakes are not gas stripped from galaxy cores by collisions but are new stars triggered into formation in the baryonic - dark - matter halo of the sq cluster as member galaxies are gently stretched away by the expansion of space .",
    "according to hgt , galaxy mergers and collisions do not strip gas but produce gas by evaporating the frozen hydrogen and helium of the planetary mass objects which dominate the baryonic mass of galaxies .",
    "the baryonic dark matter is comprised of proto - globular - star - cluster ( pgc ) clumps of planetary - mass primordial - fog - particles ( pfps ) from hydro - gravitational - theory @xcite and quasar microlensing observations @xcite . therefore the cores of sq galaxies should be deficient in gas and ygcs because they have not had mergers or collisions .",
    "following standard cdmhc cosmology and n - body computer models , galaxies and clusters of galaxies are formed by hierarchical collisionless clustering due to gravity starting with sub - galaxy mass cdm seeds condensed in the plasma epoch after the big bang .",
    "the jeans 1902 gravitational condensation criterion rules out structures forming in ordinary baryonic matter .",
    "cdm seeds are diffusionally unstable from hydro - gravitational theory and their clustering to form galaxies is contrary to observations @xcite . from hgt ,",
    "both cdmhc cosmology and the jeans 1902 criterion are fundamentally incorrect and misleading @xcite .",
    "the unknown non - baryonic cdm material is enormously diffusive compared to the h and he ions of the primordial plasma and can not condense or fragment gravitationally .",
    "however , we can be sure structure formation occurred in the plasma epoch because buoyancy within self gravitational structure is the only mechanism available to prevent turbulence .",
    "viscous forces were quite inadequate . fully developed turbulence would have produced @xmath77 values much larger than the @xmath78 values observed in numerous cosmic microwave background studies . from hgt ,",
    "structure formation first occurred by gravitational fragmentation due to the expansion of space when viscous and weak turbulence forces of the primordial plasma matched gravitational forces at scales smaller than the horizon scale @xmath79 , where @xmath24 is the speed of light and @xmath25 is the time after the big bang .",
    "the growth of structure was arrested by non - baryonic matter filling the voids between baryonic fragments .",
    "this hgt - cosmology and its application to the interpretation of sq is illustrated schematically in figure 1ab .    in fig .",
    "1a at top left we see a fragmenting proto - supercluster ( @xmath80 kg ) of the primordial plasma as it separates from other such fragments due to the rapid expansion of the universe at the time of first gravitational structure formation about 30,000 years after the big bang @xcite .",
    "the scale is near the horizon scale @xmath79 at that time @xmath81 m with baryonic density @xmath82 kg/@xmath75 and non - baryonic density @xmath83 kg/@xmath75 decreasing with time and the non - baryonic matter ( possibly neutrinos ) diffuses to fill the voids and reduce the gravitational forces @xcite . in fig .",
    "1a center proto - cluster fragments form and separate , and on the right proto - galaxies fragment just before the cooling plasma turns to gas at 300,000 years ( @xmath54 s ) .",
    "the proto - galaxies preserve the density and spin of the proto - supercluster as fossils of the primordial plasma turbulence @xcite .",
    "their initial size is therefore about @xmath84 m. these fragment into jeans - mass ( @xmath2 kg ) proto - globular - cluster ( pgc ) dense clouds of ( @xmath1 kg ) primordial - fog - particles ( pfps ) that cool , freeze , and diffuse away from the galaxy cores to form baryonic - dark - matter ( bdm ) halos around galaxies and galaxy - clusters such as sq .",
    "the jeans - mass is relevant , but not for the reasons given by jeans ( 1902 ) .",
    "some galaxy - clusters can be very slow in their separation due to crowding and frictional forces of their bdm halos , as shown by the central galaxy cluster at the right of fig .",
    "1a . the bdm halo may reveal the history of galaxy mergers and separations because strong tidal forces and radiation by galaxy cores trigger the formation of stars and ygcs as they and their halos move through each other s bdm halos , leaving star wakes and dust wakes .",
    "1b shows schematically our interpretation of sq based on hgt .",
    "the five galaxies are separated by distances inferred from hubble s law and their red shifts times the horizon distance @xmath85 m due to the stretching of space along a thin square tube of diameter @xmath86 m oriented along the line of sight to the trio .",
    "the distance to the line - of - sight tube entrance from earth is thus @xmath87 m for ngc 7320 , with the exit and trio at @xmath88 m. ngc 7320 appears larger than the trio members because it is closer , consistent with the fact that it contains numerous obvious young - globular - clusters ( ygcs ) from the hst images , but ygcs in the trio are barely resolved @xcite .",
    "the tube in fig .",
    "1b is not to scale :",
    "the true aspect ratio is that of a sheet of paper or a very long stick of uncooked spaghetti . by perspective , about 1% of the front face of the tube covers the back face .",
    "figure 2 shows an hst image of stephan s quintet .",
    "the trail of luminous material extending southeast of ngc 7319 is interpreted from hgt as a star wake formed as one of the galaxy - fragments of the original cluster moves away through the baryonic - dark - matter ( bdm ) halo , triggering star formation until it exits at the halo boundary marked by a dashed line .",
    "other star wakes in fig .",
    "2 are also marked by arrows .",
    "these star wakes are similar in origin to the filamentary galaxy vv29b of the tadpole merger @xcite and the `` tidal tails '' of the mice and antennae merging galaxies , except that in sq all the galaxies are seen to separate through each other s halos rather than merge , contrary to the standard sq @xcite model .",
    "two dust trails are shown by arrows in the upper right of fig .",
    "2 that we interpret as star wakes of the separation of ngc 7318b from ngc 7318a .",
    "a similar dust trail is interpreted from its direction as a star wake of ngc 7331 produced in the ngc 7319 bdm halo as it moved out of the cluster .",
    "the luminous trail pointing toward ngc 7320c is confirmed by gas patterns @xcite observed from broadband r measurements that suggest ngc 7320 has the same origin near ngc 7319 .",
    "an unidentified galaxy separated in the northern star forming region , leaving over a hundred ygcs @xcite before exiting the bdm halo boundary ( shown by the dashed line in the upper left of fig .",
    "details of the hubble space telescope images of stephan s quintet ( including fig .",
    "2 ) can be found at the website for the july 19 , 2001 stsci-2001 - 22 press release ( http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/2001/22/image/a ) .",
    "the images are described as `` star clusters born in the wreckage of cosmic collisions '' reflecting the large number of ygcs detected @xcite and the standard sq model @xcite .    according to our hgt interpretation , none of the ygcs are due to galaxy collisions or mergers .",
    "all are formed in the bdm halos as the galaxies gently separate with small transverse velocity along lines of sight .",
    "there were no cosmic collisions and there is no wreckage .",
    "numerous very well resolved ygcs can be seen in the ngc 7320 high resolution image with separations indicating numbers in the range @xmath89 .",
    "this suggests a significant fraction the dark baryonic matter in the halo of ngc 7320 has been triggered to form ygcs and stars as the galaxy separated through both the dense bdm halo of the sq trio and the bdm halo of its companion galaxy ngc 7331 , also at @xmath90 .",
    "no such concentration of ygcs can be seen in the sq trio galaxies , consistent with our hgt interpretation that they are at 8.3 times the distance of ngc 7320 as shown in fig .",
    "the present status of observations of stephan s quintet is well summarized by gutierrez et al .",
    "2002 , including their deep broadband r and narrowband @xmath91 maps shown in figure 3 .",
    "the r band map ( their fig .",
    "1 ) with sensitivity 26 mag arcsec@xmath92 extends to a wide range that includes ngc 7320c with the other sq member galaxies .",
    "a clear @xmath91 bridge is shown with red shift @xmath93 corresponding to that of the sq trio to a sharp interface with @xmath90 material in ngc 7320 , consistent with our interpretation that the bridge was formed in the bdm halo of the sq trio by ngc 7320 as it emerged and separated by the expansion of the universe along the line of sight , as shown by the dashed arrow in fig .",
    "2 .    a corresponding dashed arrow in fig . 3 shows the new @xmath91 bridge from the sq trio at red shift 0.022 with sharp transition to 0.0027 at ngc 7320 , proving the two are widely separated in space but likely with the same origin , as we show is expected from hgt in fig . 1b .    the solid arrow shown in fig .",
    "3 toward ngc 7320c suggests its emergence from the sq trio bdm halo leaving the star wake shown by a corresponding arrow in fig .",
    "the mechanism of star wake production is that the frozen pfps are in meta - stable equilibrium within their pgcs .",
    "radiation from a passing galaxy causes evaporation of gas and tidal forces which together increase the rate of accretion of the pfps to form larger planets and finally stars .",
    "the size of the stars and their lifetimes depends on the turbulence levels produced in the gas according to hgt .",
    "large turbulence levels produce large , short lived stars .",
    "the dust lane between ngc 7318a and its double ngc 7318b suggests large turbulence levels produced large stars that have since turned to dust through supernovas .",
    "a similar dust lane from ngc 7219 is in the general direction of ngc 7331 and its companions , as indicated by the arrow in fig .",
    "we conclude that stephan s quintet is well described by hydro - gravitational - theory and cosmology @xcite . according to hgt cosmology , all the sq galaxies formed in a cluster by gravitational fragmentation of the primordial plasma just before photon decoupling and transition to gas 300,000 years after the big bang . none of the galaxies show evidence of subsequent collisions or mergers .",
    "they remained stuck together for 12.9 billion years until 220 million years ago when the uniform expansion of space in the universe finally overcame gravitational forces and frictional forces of the cluster baryonic - dark - matter halo .",
    "the nature of the baryonic - dark - matter halo is explained by hgt and supported by the sq observations . at the plasma - gas transition",
    "the proto - galaxy plasma clouds turned to gas . from hgt @xcite the gas fragmented at both the jeans scale , to form proto - globular - star - cluster ( pgc ) clumps ( @xmath2 kg ) , and the viscous schwarz scale , to form small - planetary - mass ( @xmath1 kg ) primordial - fog - particles ( pfps ) , consistent with the conclusion @xcite from quasar microlensing observations that the lens galaxy mass is dominated by `` rogue planets likely to be the missing mass '' .",
    "some of the pfps near the proto - galaxy centers accreted to form stars and the luminous galaxy cores .",
    "most pfps condensed and froze as the universe expanded and cooled so their pgcs remained dark and gradually diffused away from the galaxy cores to form bdm galaxy halos , and some diffused further to form cluster baryonic - dark - matter ( bdm ) halos .",
