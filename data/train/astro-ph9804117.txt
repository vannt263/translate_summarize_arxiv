    "the rle of hydrogen molecules as cooling agents in primordial gas clouds , necessary to form the first stars out of a gas of h and he with no heavier elements , is intimately related to the fate of those clouds in the presence of ionizing and dissociating radiation . that such radiation had an important effect on these primordial clouds is certain .",
    "the neutral , opaque igm out of which the first bound objects condensed was dramatically reheated and reionized at some time between a redshift @xmath0 and @xmath1 by the radiation released by some of these objects ( cf .",
    "[ 1 ] and references therein ) . when the first sources turned on , they ionized their surroundings by propagating weak , r - type ionization fronts which moved outward supersonically with respect to both the neutral gas ahead of and the ionized gas behind the front , racing ahead of the hydrodynamical response of the igm [ 2,3 ] .",
    "the effect of density inhomogeneity on the rate of i - front propagation was previously described by a mean `` clumping factor '' @xmath2 , which slowed the i - fronts by increasing the average recombination rate per h atom inside clumps .",
    "this suffices to describe the rate of i - front propagation as long as the clumps are either not self - shielding or , if so , only absorb a fraction of the ionizing photons emitted by the central source .",
    "what is the dynamical effect of the i - front on the density inhomogeneity it encounters , however ?",
    "the answer depends on the size and density of the clumps overtaken by the i - front .",
    "the fate of linear density fluctuations depends upon their jeans number , @xmath3 , the wavelength in units of the baryon jeans length in the igm at temperatures of order @xmath4 .",
    "fluctuations with @xmath5 find their growth halted and reversed ( cf . [ 4 ] ) .",
    "for nonlinear density fluctuations , however , the answer is more complicated , depending upon at least three dimensionless parameters , their internal jeans number , @xmath6 , the ratio of the cloud radius @xmath7 to the jeans length @xmath8 inside the cloud at about @xmath9 , their `` strmgren number '' @xmath10 , the ratio of the cloud radius @xmath7 to the strmgren length @xmath11 inside the cloud ( the length of a column of gas within which the unshielded arrival rate of ionizing photons just balances the total recombination rate ) , and their optical depth to h ionizing photons at 13.6 ev , @xmath12 , before ionization . if @xmath13 , the i - front sweeps across the cloud , leaving an ionized gas at higher pressure than its surroundings , and exits before any mass motion occurs in response , causing the cloud to blow apart .",
    "if @xmath14 and @xmath15 , however , the cloud shields itself against ionizing photons , trapping the i - front which enters the cloud , causing it to decelerate inside the cloud to the sound speed of the ionized gas before it can exit the other side , thereby transforming itself into a weak , d - type front preceded by a shock . typically , the side facing the source expels a supersonic wind backwards towards the source , which shocks the igm outside the cloud , while the remaining neutral cloud material is accelerated away from the source by the so - called `` rocket effect '' as the cloud photoevaporates ( cf .",
    "as long as @xmath5 ( the case for gas bound to dark halos with virial velocity less than @xmath16 ) , this photoevaporation proceeds unimpeded by gravity . for halos with higher virial velocity , however , @xmath17 , and gravity competes with pressure forces . for a uniform gas of h density @xmath18 , located a distance @xmath19 ( in mpc ) from a uv source emitting @xmath20 ionizing photons ( in units of @xmath21 ) ,",
    "the strmgren length is only @xmath22 .",
    "we focus in what follows on the self - shielded case which traps the i - front .",
    "some of these results were summarized previously by us in [ 6 ] .",
    "as a first study of these important effects , we have simulated the photoevaporation of a uniform , spherical , neutral , intergalactic cloud of gas mass @xmath23 , radius @xmath24 , density @xmath25 and @xmath26 , in which self - gravity is unimportant , located @xmath27 from a quasar with emission spectrum @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 , initially in pressure balance with an ambient igm of density @xmath31 which at time @xmath32 has just been photoionized by the passage of the intergalactic r - type i - front generated when the quasar turned on . [ a standard top - hat perturbation which collapses and virializes at @xmath33 , for example , with total mass @xmath34 , has circular velocity @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , if @xmath38 and @xmath39 . ]",
    "apart from h and he , the cloud also contains heavy elements at @xmath40 times the solar abundance .",
    "our simulations in 2d , axisymmetry use an eulerian hydro code ( called coral ) , with adaptive mesh refinement and a riemann solver based on the van  leer flux - splitting algorithm , which solves nonequilibrium ionization rate equations ( for h , he , c , n , o , ne , and  s ) and includes an explicit treatment of radiative transfer by taking into account the bound - free opacity of h and he [ 7,8,9 ] .",
    "our grid size in cylindrical coordinates @xmath41 was @xmath42  cells ( fully refined ) .",
    "most current simulations of cosmological gas dynamics which include photoionization do so by approximating the radiation field as uniform and isotropic , ignoring the inhomogeneity of the radiation field and setting optical depth to zero",
    ". to illustrate the importance of a more realistic approach to radiative transfer , we present results for two cases in what follows : ( 1 ) zero optical depth and ( 2 ) optical depth properly included .",
    "figure  1 shows the structure of the cloud @xmath43 after it was overtaken by the quasar s i - front as it sweeps past the cloud in the igm when optical depth is neglected .",
    "the cloud and igm are both instantaneously photoionized everywhere in this case , causing the overpressured cloud to expand isotropically into the surrounding igm , acting as a spherical piston which sweeps up the igm and drives a shock into it .",
    "the cloud matter eventually expands as a shell and evacuates a spherical hole .",
    "the column densities of h  i , he  i and ii , and c  iv for cloud gas of different velocities as seen along the symmetry axis at different times are shown in figure 3 .",
    "this cloud would initially resemble a velocity - broadened lyman alpha forest quasar absorber ( `` lf '' ) 10 s of @xmath44 wide , with @xmath45 , which evolves toward a narrower lf absorber with @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 throughout . as the spatial variations for the relative abundances of selected metal ions at 50 myr plotted in figure 5",
    "show , only highly ionized metals are present in this case .",
    "by contrast , we show results for all these same quantities from the simulation which takes proper account of optical depth , instead , in figures 2 , 4 , and 6 . since @xmath49",
    "initially , the cloud traps the i - front , as described above , and drives a supersonic wind from the surface facing the quasar .",
    "it takes more than @xmath50 to evaporate the cloud , accelerating it to 10 s of @xmath44 in the process .",
    "key features of the flow are indicated by the numbers which label them on the temperature plot in figure 2 : 1 = igm shock ; 2 = contact discontinuity between shocked cloud wind and swept up igm ; 3 = wind shock ; between 3 and 4 = supersonic wind ; 4 = i - front ; 5 = shock preceding i - front ; 6 = shock that leads the motion of remaining neutral cloud gas into the shadow region . at early times",
    ", the cloud gas resembles a weak damped lyman alpha ( `` dla '' ) absorber with small velocity width ( @xmath51 ) and @xmath52 , with velocity - broadened lf - like wings ( @xmath53 ) with @xmath54 on the side moving toward the quasar , with a c  iv feature with @xmath48 displaced in this same asymmetric way from the velocity of peak h  i column density . after 160 myr , however , only a narrow h  i feature with lf - like column density @xmath55 remains , with @xmath56 and @xmath57/[c]_\\odot$ ] . unlike the zero - optical - depth approximation , figure 6 shows the presence at 50 myrs of low as well as high ionization stages of the metals .",
