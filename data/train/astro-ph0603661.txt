    "the particle nature of the dark matter remains a mystery .",
    "this is contrasted with the firmly established dark matter abundance , which has been measured using the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure observations  @xcite .",
    "a wide range of dark matter particle candidates have been proposed , including axions , the lightest supersymmetric particle , and sterile neutrinos .",
    "recently , sterile neutrinos have gained renewed interest , since theoretical considerations have shown them to be a natural part of a minimally extended standard model , the @xmath0msm .",
    "this @xmath0msm , which is the standard model extended with only 3 sterile neutrinos , manages to explain the masses of the active neutrinos  @xcite , the baryon asymmetry of the universe  @xcite , and the abundance of dark matter  @xcite .    arguably , one of the most appealing aspects of sterile neutrinos as dark matter candidates is , that they will very likely either be detected or rejected during the next couple of years .",
    "this is because the sterile neutrinos decay virtually at rest into a photon and an active neutrino producing a sharp decay line at @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass of the sterile neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "this photon line can now be searched for in cosmic high energy data of the background radiation ( for recent studies see @xcite ) , towards massive structures like galaxy clusters  @xcite , or towards dark matter structures with a very low fraction of baryons  @xcite .",
    "the sterile neutrino was originally introduced in order to alleviate discrepancies between the theory of cold dark matter structure formation and observations  @xcite , which indicated that the dark matter particle should be warm .",
    "traditionally `` warm '' means that the mass of the dark matter particle should be in the kev range , in order to suppress the formation of small scale structures .",
    "while some of these problems have found other solutions , sterile neutrinos have found other uses , including an explanation for the pulsar peculiar velocities  @xcite , synthesising early star formation  @xcite , and , as mentioned above , as an explanation for the masses of the active neutrinos and the baryon asymmetry  @xcite . also constraints on doube @xmath3 decays",
    "have been derived @xcite .",
    "we will here follow the idea of  @xcite and look for a decay line towards a region with very little baryons .",
    "specifically we will study x - ray `` blank '' regions in the sky with no known x - ray sources . by doing",
    "so we will search for a signal from the dark matter halo of our own galaxy .",
    "we will see that the signal is very low for photons with energies of the order 0.110  kev , which allows us to exclude part of the sterile neutrino parameter space .",
    "we have analysed a 0.39  kev spectrum extracted from many combined _ chandra _ acis - s3 blank sky observations ( shown in  [ fig : gaussian ] ) with ciao 3.3 , and fitted spectral models with the spectral fitting package xspec @xcite .",
    "the line features at 1.74  kev , 2.12.2  kev , and 7.48  kev are si  @xmath4 , the au  @xmath5 complex , and ni  @xmath4 respectively , originating from fluorescence of material in the telescope and focal plane ( i.e.  they are seen in spectra obtained when acis - s3 is stowed and not pointing at the sky ) .",
    "however , a decay line from dark matter could `` hide '' under these prominent lines . in this case",
    "the decay line should be redshifted by a factor of @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the redshift of the dark matter emitter .",
    "dark matter concentrations located at different distances should thus give rise to lines at different observed energies . in order to test for this , we extracted spectra from acis - s3 data of two galaxy clusters , a383 and a478 , at redshifts , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "we optimized the ratio between expected dark matter signal and emission from hot intracluster gas by extracting spectra from the cluster outskirts .",
    "the x - ray emission from hot intracluster gas is proportional to the gas density squared , whereas the emission of photons from dark matter is directly proportional to the dark matter density .",
    "hence , in the cluster outskirts the gas surface brightness falls off with projected cluster - centric distance , @xmath10 as , @xmath11 ( assuming a typical @xmath3-model ) whereas the dark matter surface brightness is expected to fall off as @xmath12 ( assuming an isothermal sphere ) . specifically , we have extracted spectra from an outer radial bin , defined by optimizing the ratio of matter in the field of view ( proportional to the signal from decaying dark matter ) to the x - ray emission from the intracluster gas ( `` noise '' ) described by a @xmath3-profile .",
    "the outer radius was chosen as the radius with the optimal ratio ( which is very close to the edge of the acis - s3 chip ) and the inner radius was chosen so the signal to noise ratio had a value of half the optimal value .",
    "no obvious line features was detected at the corresponding redshifted energies .",
    "we then proceeded to firmly constrain the flux from any dark matter decay line in the full energy interval spanned by the blank sky spectrum .",
    "the blank sky spectrum was well fitted ( reduced @xmath13 for 540 d.o.f . ) by a composite model consisting of an exponential plus a power law plus four gaussians for the most prominent lines .",
    "a hypothetical mono - energetic emission line in the spectrum was represented by a gaussian , centered at the line energy , and with a width , @xmath14 , given by the instrument spectral resolution : @xmath15  kev for @xmath16  kev and @xmath17  kev for @xmath18  kev .",
    "( the velocity of the halo dark matter is producing negligible line broadening , @xmath19 ) .",
    "for each energy in steps of 0.05  kev , we defined a gaussian with the instrumental width and maximum at the model value of the fit to the broad - band spectrum .",
    "the flux of this gaussian was then calculated providing an upper limit of emission from decaying dark matter at the given energy .",
    "this is a model independent and very conservative analysis , since any x - ray emitters within the field of view , and background , contributes to the extracted spectrum .",
    "if we instead only allowed the decay signal from potential decaying dark matter to produce a bump above the `` base line '' spectrum , then we could improve the bounds by a large factor  @xcite .",
    "however , this approach would depend sensitively on the robustness of modelling background and emissions from sources contributing to the `` base line '' spectrum .",
    "the amount of dark matter from our galaxy within the observed field of view is only a minute fraction of the total mass of the halo .",
    "we use the model for the milky way presented in  @xcite , namely an nfw dark matter profile with @xmath20 , virial radius @xmath21 kpc , concentration @xmath22 , and solar distance @xmath23 kpc .",
    "we then integrate out through the milky way halo to find the expected signal .",
    "changing the details of this model does not significantly affrect our results ( e.g.  changing the inner density slope between @xmath24 and zero , or changing the outer slope between @xmath25 and @xmath26 , changes the predicted signal by less than a factor of 2 ) .",
    "there is also an uncertainty , possibly as large as a factor of 2 , arising from using the value of @xmath20 .",
    "the blank sky spectrum was extracted from the full angular opening of the _ chandra _ acis - s3 chip which is @xmath27 corresponding to a mass within the field of view of @xmath28 at a mean luminosity distance of @xmath29  kpc , derived from the model mentioned above .    the luminosity from decaying sterile neutrinos is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the energy of the photons , @xmath32 is the number of sterile neutrinos particles in the field of view ( @xmath33 ) and @xmath34 is the decay rate .",
    "the flux at a luminosity distance , @xmath35 , is : @xmath36 the observed flux , @xmath37 , at a given energy ( @xmath38 ) yields a conservative upper limit on the flux from decaying sterile neutrinos , so eq .  [ eqn : flux ] can be rewritten as : @xmath39    from the blank sky flux , an upper limit on the decay rate has been derived as function of line energy and plotted in  [ fig : decayrate ] .",
    "the neutrinos can decay via various channels , and the lifetime of the sterile neutrinos is given by @xcite : @xmath40 @xmath41 is the mixing angle with the active neutrino , and @xmath42 takes into account the open decay channels so that for @xmath43 , where only the neutrino channel is open , @xmath44 .",
    "the mixing angle is given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "209 ,  210 ) : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the temperature at which the sterile neutrinos are produced . for neutrino masses of @xmath47 kev ,",
    "the neutrinos are produced near the qcd phase transition  @xcite , making the distribution somewhat non - thermal  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath48 for such neutrinos is very conservatively considered to be between 10.75 and 20 , depending on the details of the qcd phase transition .",
    "we will here use @xmath49 as a reference value .",
    "a numerical calculation including the details of the qcd phase - transition  @xcite has confirmed that the choice @xmath50 gives good agreement with the analytical results presented by @xcite .",
    "s is a free parameter taking into account that additional entropy may be produced after the sterile neutrinos have been created  @xcite .",
    "this parameter was suggested to be in the range between 1 and 100  @xcite .",
    "@xmath51 is a constant depending on which active neutrino the sterile neutrinos are assumed to mix with .",
    "it takes the values @xmath52 for @xmath53 mixing with @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "the sterile neutrinos are assumed to account for all dark matter , i.e.  @xmath57 , and the hubble parameter at the present time , @xmath58 , given as @xmath59 .",
    "@xcite derived the branching ratio for the radiative decay , @xmath60 , to be @xmath61 . now",
    "the lifetime can be rewritten as : @xmath62 an upper limit on the decay rate is constrained from eq .  [",
    "eqn : maxdecay ] and @xmath63 the lower limit on the lifetime from the data and the model predictions are plotted in  [ fig : lifetime ] for various values of @xmath64 and @xmath48 .",
    "we see from  [ fig : lifetime ] that the blank sky data ( solid red line ) is at least one order of magnitude less restrictive than the simplest sterile model predictions ( hatched region ) .",
    "models with significant entropy production , @xmath65 , are excluded in the mass range @xmath66 .",
    "for @xmath67 we exclude @xmath68 .",
    "these constraints are more restrictive than the ones obtained for the coma cluster periphery @xcite for masses less than approximately @xmath69 kev .",

    "the simplest models with @xmath70 are bounded from below , @xmath72 , using ly@xmath73 observations @xcite , and possibly even @xmath74  kev according to a recent analysis  @xcite .",
    "these constraints are weakned when allowing for @xmath75  @xcite , since additional entropy dilutes the momentum of the sterile neutrinos .",
    "upper limits on the sterile neutrino mass are derived from the flux of the diffuse photon background  @xcite , and are of the order @xmath76  kev for @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "these bounds are strengthened for @xmath75 , since the sterile neutrinos then will decay faster .    a strict lower bound on the sterile neutrino mass arises since big bang nucleosynthesis only allows approximately @xmath77 additional relativistic neutrino species to be populated at @xmath78  mev temperatures .",

    "the strong claim of an upper mass limit presented in @xcite , under - estimated the flux from virgo cluster by 2 orders of magnitude , and is unreliable @xcite .    comparing these existing bounds with our findings ,",
    "we conclude that a broad band in neutrino parameter space is still open as shown in  [ fig : m_s ] . taking the results of @xcite into account ,",
