    "rating and ranking in sport have a flourishing tradition .",
    "each sport competition has its own official rating , from which a ranking of players and teams can be compiled .",
    "the challenge of many sports fans and bettors is to beat the official rating method : to develop an alternative rating algorithm that is better than the official one in the task of predicting future results . as a consequence",
    ", many sport rating methods have been developed .",
    "amy n. langville and carl d. meyer even wrote a ( compelling ) book about ( general ) rating and ranking methods entitled _ who s # 1 ? _ @xcite .    in 1997 , kenneth massey , then an undergraduate , created a method for ranking college football teams .",
    "he wrote about this method , which uses the mathematical theory of least squares , as his honors thesis @xcite .",
    "informally , at any given time @xmath0 , massey s method rates a team @xmath1 according to the following two factors : ( a ) the difference between points for and points against @xmath1 , or point spread of @xmath1 , up to time @xmath0 , and ( b ) the ratings of the teams that @xmath1 matched up to time @xmath0 .",
    "hence , highly rated teams have a large point differential and matched strong teams so far .",
    "below in the ranking are teams that did well but had an easy schedule as well as teams that did not so well but had a tough schedule .    in this paper",
    "we propose a temporalized version of the original massey s method .",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "for a given team @xmath1 and time @xmath0 , the original massey rates @xmath1 according to the point spread of @xmath1 up to time @xmath0 and the ratings of the teams that @xmath1 matched up to time @xmath0 .",
    "notice , however , that the rating of a matched team @xmath2 is computed with respect to time @xmath0 , and not , as we argue it should be more reasonable , with respect to the ( possibly previous ) time when @xmath1 and @xmath2 matched .",
    "suppose , for instance , that @xmath1 and @xmath2 matched at time @xmath3 , when team @xmath2 was strong ( high in the ranking ) , and now , at time @xmath4 , team @xmath2 lost positions in the ranking and is thus weaker .",
    "the original massey s method adds up to the rating of @xmath1 the _ current _ low rating of @xmath2 computed at time @xmath4 , and not the _ past _ high rating of @xmath2 computed at time @xmath3 .",
    "the temporalized massey s method we propose solves this issue . at",
    "any given time @xmath0 of the season , the temporalized massey s method rates a team @xmath1 according to ( a ) the point spread of @xmath1 up to time @xmath0 , and ( b ) the ratings of the teams that @xmath1 matched up to time @xmath0 computed with respect to the _ time they matched_.    the paper is organized as follows . section [ sec : massey ] reviews the original massey s method .",
    "we propose the temporalized interpretation of the massey s method in section [ sec : tmassey ] . in section",
    "[ sec : closer ] we investigate the algebra of the proposed method while in section [ sec : example ] we apply it to the last italian soccer championship .",
    "we review related methods for sport rating in section [ sec : related ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in this section we offer a brief introduction to the original massey s method .",
    "a more general introduction can be found in @xcite .",
    "the main idea of massey s method , as proposed in @xcite , is enclosed in the following equation :    @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the ratings of teams @xmath1 and @xmath2 and @xmath8 is the margin of victory for game @xmath9 of team @xmath1 . if there are @xmath10 teams who played @xmath11 games , we have a linear system :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is a @xmath14 matrix such the k - th row of @xmath13 contains all 0s with the exception of a 1 in location @xmath1 and a @xmath15 in location @xmath2 , meaning that team @xmath1 beat team @xmath2 in match @xmath9 ( if match @xmath9 ends with a draw , either @xmath1 or @xmath2 location can be assigned @xmath16 , and the other @xmath15 ) .",
    "observe that , if @xmath17 denotes the vector of all @xmath16 s , then @xmath18 .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 . notice that    @xmath21    and @xmath22 is the signed sum of point spreads of every game played by @xmath1 .",
    "clearly the entries of @xmath23 sum to @xmath24 , in fact @xmath25 .",
    "the massey s method is then defined by the following linear system :    @xmath26    which corresponds to the least squares solution of system ( [ massey1 ] ) .",
    "we observe how the massey s team ratings are in fact interdependent . indeed",
    ", massey s matrix @xmath27 can be decomposed as    @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a diagonal matrix with @xmath30 equal to the number of games played by team @xmath1 , and @xmath31 is a matrix with @xmath32 equal to the number of matches played by team @xmath1 against team @xmath2 . hence",
    ", linear system ( [ massey2 ] ) is equivalent to    @xmath33    or , equivalently    @xmath34 that is , for any team @xmath1    @xmath35    this means , and the same observation can be found in @xcite , that the rating @xmath6 of team @xmath1 is the sum @xmath36 of two meaningful components :    1 .   the mean rating of teams that @xmath1 has matched @xmath37 2 .   the mean point spread of team @xmath1 @xmath38    it is worth pointing out that the ratings computed by massey s method correspond to averages .",
    "hence , it could happen that a team that plays with good performances a limited number of matches against strong teams obtains an extremely high and not justified rating .",
    "actually this effect has been clearly discussed in @xcite . to overcome this problem the authors propose to introduce a dummy team that defeats all the teams that played a number of matches below a suitable cutoff .    in order to better understand the behaviour of the method , it is interesting to analyse what happens to massey s system at the end of the season , assuming a round - robin competition in which all @xmath10 teams matched all other teams exactly once . in this case , the opponents rating component @xmath39 where we have used the fact that @xmath40 , and the point spread component @xmath41 hence @xmath42 and thus @xmath43 hence , the final rating of a team is simply the mean point spread of the team .",
    "it is possible to be a bit more precise about this property of massey s method by exploiting the properties of the set of eigenvalues , or spectrum , of the laplacian matrix @xmath44 .",
    "the spectrum reflects various aspects of the structure of the graph @xmath45 associated with @xmath31 , in particular those related to connectedness .",
    "it is well known that the laplacian is singular and positive semidefinite ( recall that @xmath46 and @xmath18 ) so that its eigenvalues are nonnegative and can be ordered as follows : @xmath47 it can be shown that @xmath48 , see for example @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity of @xmath49 as an eigenvalue of the laplacian can be shown to be equal to the number of the connected components of the graph , see again @xcite . if the graph of the matches is connected or , equivalently ,",
    "@xmath27 is irreducible , as we assume in the following , @xmath50 is known as _ algebraic connectivity _ of the graph and is an indicator of the effort to be employed in order to disconnect the graph .",
    "we can write the spectral decomposition of @xmath27 as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is orthogonal and its first column is equal to @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "from @xmath58 we obtain @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath56 , @xmath62 .",
    "now @xmath63u^tp,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the identity matrix .",
    "observe that the first component of the vector @xmath65 is equal to zero so that @xmath66u^tp = u\\bigr[d^+-\\frac{\\tilde{i}}{n}\\bigl]u^tp,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 .",
    "if we denote with @xmath68 the euclidean norm we obtain @xmath69u^tp\\|\\le \\|p\\| \\max_{k=2,\\ldots , n } \\bigl| \\frac{1}{\\lambda_k}-\\frac{1}{n}\\bigr|\\le \\|p\\|\\frac{n-\\lambda_2}{n\\lambda_2},\\ ] ] where we used the fact that the euclidean norm of an orthogonal matrix is equal to one .",
    "hence , as the algebraic connectivity @xmath55 , as well as the other eigenvalues , approach @xmath10 , that is , as more and more matches are played , the vector @xmath70 approaches @xmath71 and the equality is reached when the graph of the matches becomes complete .",
    "we propose a temporalized variant of the original massey s method .",
    "the main idea of the new proposal is to compute the rating of a matched team with respect to the time when the match was played , and not with respect to the current time , as massey does .",
    "we consider a temporal process of matches between pairs of teams that occur at a given time .",
    "each element of the process is a tern @xmath72 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the teams that matched and @xmath0 is the time of the match .",
    "time is discrete and is represented with natural numbers @xmath73 .",
    "we assume that each team plays at most one match at any given time .",
    "matches ( of different teams ) that occur at the same time are considered to happen simultaneously .",
    "let @xmath74 be the difference of the points for team @xmath1 and the points against team @xmath1 in the match of time @xmath0 , where we assume @xmath75 if @xmath1 does not play at time @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath76 be the number of games that team @xmath1 played until time @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath77 be the teams matched by @xmath1 until time @xmath0 and @xmath78 be the timestamps of these matches .",
    "then the rating of team @xmath1 at time @xmath0 is defined as follows .",
    "we set @xmath79 for all teams @xmath1 .",
    "hence all teams are initially equally ranked . for any team @xmath1 , if @xmath1 did not play so far , that is @xmath80 , then its rating is still null .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath81 , we have that , for every @xmath82 :    @xmath83    this means that the rating @xmath84 of team @xmath1 at time @xmath0 is the sum @xmath85 of two meaningful components :    * the mean _ historical _ rating of teams that @xmath1 has matched : @xmath86 * the mean point spread of team @xmath1 at time @xmath0 : @xmath87    notice that we set @xmath79 for all teams , meaning that at the start of the competition all teams are considered equal",
    ". this might be not always realistic : we sometimes know that some teams are potentially stronger than others . hence , an alternative solution is to set @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the exogenous strength of @xmath1 before the competition starts .",
    "for instance , we can set the exogenous strength to be proportional to the rating of the team at the end of the previous season .",
    "we illustrate the proposed method with the following simple example ( a complete application is discussed in section [ sec : example ] ) .",
    "the table below shows the results of 6 matches ( numbered from 1 to 6 ) , divided in 3 days representing a different time ( numbered from 1 to 3 ) , involving 4 fictitious teams ( labelled a , b , c , d ) :    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]              a rigorous test for a rating system is _ foresight prediction accuracy _ @xcite : how well the vector @xmath90 of ratings computed at day @xmath0 can predict the winners at day @xmath91 ?",
    "more precisely , the foresight prediction accuracy of a method is the number of victories that the method corrected foresaw divided by the total number of victories of that competition ( we ruled out the ties ) .",
    "hence , accuracy of 0 means no predictions were correct , while accuracy of 1 means that all predictions were correct .",
    "we also computed accuracy introducing a home - field advantage , which was empirically determined for each method and added to the rating of the team playing at home .",
    "a home - field advantage matters for foresight prediction in time - varying methods : since initially all teams are rated equal , then in the beginning , before there is enough competition to significantly distinguish the teams ratings , home - field consideration is the only criterion that the method can use to draw a distinction between two teams .",
    "we compared three time - varying rating methods with and without home - field advantage ( see table [ tab : accuracy ] ) : official rating of the italian soccer league , temporalized massey s method , and elo s method ( see section [ sec : related ] for a review of this method ) .",
    "temporalized massey is slightly more predictive than elo and significantly better than the official rating .",
    "moreover , for all methods , introducing the home - field advantage has a significant impact in the prediction accuracy .",
    "we also computed , for the temporalized massey s method , the foresight prediction accuracies at each day of the competition ( with home - field advantage ) .",
    "the histogram of accuracies is depicted in figure [ fig : foresight ] . only 2 predictions are below the threshold of 50% of accuracy corresponding to randomness ( notice that the 3 predictions in the 40%-50% histogram bar are in fact equal to 50% ) .",
    "on the other hand , most of predictions ( 78% ) are above 60% of accuracy , with 12 predictions ( 32% ) above 80% of accuracy and 3 predictions ( 8% ) with 100% of accuracy .",
    "related to prediction accuracy , consider the following story .",
    "teams inter and juventus had a peculiar season in 2015 - 2016 .",
    "inter immediately won the first matches , but with low spread of points . on the other hand ,",
    "the start of juventus was disastrous .",
    "this led inter well above juventus in the official ranking , with a maximum distance of 10 points at days 5 and 6 . from day 10 , however , juventus started an incredible row of wins , culminating at day 19 when the two teams were pair in official standings .",
    "finally , at day 38 , juventus powerfully won the championship with 24 points above inter . in figure",
    "[ fig : ij ] we depict the temporal dynamics of the official , original massey , and temporalized massey rankings during the first round of the championship .",
    "the superiority of juventus with respect to inter is not witnessed by the official ranking until the end of the round . on the other hand , massey and in particular its temporalized version",
    "predicted this supremacy well before the end of the round .",
    "an recent account of dynamic modelling of sports tournaments can be found in @xcite . in the paper ,",
    "only the outcomes ( win - draw - loss ) of the matches , and not point spreads , are considered .",
    "the abilities of the home and visiting teams are assumed to evolve separately in time following an exponentially weighted moving average process ruled by a constant coefficients linear recurrence . in our approach",
    "the two abilities are twisted together and the evolution is described by a variable coefficients recurrence .    a good survey of dynamic models for teams strengths in nfl can be found in @xcite .",
    "generally teams abilities are assumed to evolve through a first order autoregressive process .",
    "for example in @xcite this strategy is used to model season to season changes of team abilities while in @xcite week to week changes . as we explained in section",
    "[ sec : tmassey ] , due to the variability of the coefficients of recurrence ( [ eq : tmassey2 ] ) our approach gives , as season proceeds , a greater importance to the history of the results compared with the one given by an autoregressive model .    in",
    "@xcite the authors propose nonuniform weighting for sports rankings .",
    "their technique allows to weight differently late season play but also , for example , home court advantage or high - pressure games .",
    "actually , their target application is using the matches of the division i ncaa in order to produce brackets for the famous ncaa men s division i basketball tournament , also known as march madness . for massey s method",
    "this idea is implemented placing the weights in a diagonal matrix @xmath92 and by solving , instead of system ( [ massey1 ] ) , the system @xmath93 .",
    "notice that this is equivalent to the substitution of the two means present in ( [ massey4 ] ) with two weighted means , whose weights are the diagonal entries of @xmath92 . the authors discuss and experiment various strategies for choosing the weights : in the simplest one the weights linearly increase from the first day of the season to the last day .",
    "the authors also apply their weighting technique to another popular ranking method , namely colley s method @xcite .",
    "it is important to remark that the temporalization technique that we developed for massey s method can easily be extended to colley s method .",
    "the equation ( 3 ) in @xcite is at the heart of colley s method and can be rewritten with our notations as follows @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 , with @xmath97 , are respectively the number of wins and of losses of team @xmath1 .",
    "our temporalized variant of colley s method is ruled by the following equation @xmath98 where now @xmath99 and @xmath100 , with @xmath101 , are respectively the number of wins and of losses of team @xmath1 up and including time @xmath0 .",
    "a popular time - varying rating system used is sport competitions is elo s method @xcite .",
    "it was coined by the physics professor and excellent chess player arpad elo .",
    "let @xmath102 be the score of team @xmath1 against team @xmath2 ; for instance , in chess a win is given a score of 1 and a draw a score of 1/2 ( and a defeat a score of 0 ) .",
    "let @xmath103 be the number of points that team @xmath1 is expected to score against team @xmath2 ; this is typically computed as a logistic function of the difference of ratings between the players , for instance , @xmath104 where @xmath105 and @xmath106 is a constant ( in the chess world @xmath107 ) . then , when teams @xmath1 and @xmath2 match , the new rank @xmath108 of team @xmath1 is updated as follows ( and similarly for @xmath2 ) : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a constant ( for instance , in chess @xmath111 for new players )",
    ". hence , beating a stronger player has a larger reward than beating a weaker one .",
    "notice the intriguing similarity of elo s update equation with equation ( [ eq : tmassey2 ] ) defining temporalized massey s method .",
    "both methods update the old rating of a team in terms of the same ingredients : the current performance of the team and the rating of the opponent team . however , the two methods mix these ingredients in different ways , and hence the resulting recipe differs .",
    "while elo uses a logistic ( exponential ) function to mix performance and opponent rating , massey linearly combines the two .",
    "moreover , the combination parameters @xmath110 and @xmath106 in elo are constant , while the combination parameters @xmath112 and @xmath113 of temporalized massey vary with the team and in time .",
    "we introduced a temporalized version of the popular massey s method for rating actors in sport competitions .",
    "the idea of the new method is quite simple : to rate the matched team with respect to the time when the match was played .",
    "we showed that the resulting method can be described as a dynamic temporal process in which the rating of any team @xmath1 is modified when @xmath1 matches some other team @xmath2 and the update of the rating is a function of the performance of @xmath1 during the match with @xmath2 and of the rating of @xmath2 before the match .",
    "we applied the new method to the italian soccer league showing a good foresight prediction accuracy .",
    "in fact , the idea of temporalizing the massey s method we have proposed in this context can be be generalized to any recursive centrality measures on networks .",
    "consider for instance pagerank centrality @xcite , which claims that a node is important if it is linked to by other important nodes .",
    "for instance , a scholar is relevant if it is cited by relevant scholars , or a web page is important if it is hyperlinked to by other important web pages .",
    "the original definition of the pagerank method ignores the time of creation of the link between nodes .",
    "however , we argue that it is different if we , as scholars , receive an endorsement from a young and almost unknown author , or from the same author when she won the turing award . similarly , there is a difference in receiving a link from a peripheral web page or from the same page when it became a central hub .",
    "we look forward to a temporalized version of pagerank with an application to sport competitions ."
