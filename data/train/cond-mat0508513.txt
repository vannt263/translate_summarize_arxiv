    "this indicates a solid - smectic transition .",

    "it is interesting to note that , at these points @xmath30 has discontinuities and the system fails@xcite .",
    "this shows that the mode of failure predicted by our theory is through a solid - smectic transition . the fact that @xmath92 remains non - zero even at very small densities , due to the confinement from the walls , gives rise to the density modulations in the confined liquid .",
    "we have shown therefore that the overlap in the density profiles may be used as an `` order parameter '' for the solid to smectic transition .",

    "the overlap reduces , again due to increased separation between neighbouring lattice points . at higher strains the smectic melts into a modulated liquid due to increased fluctuations connected with the reduced density@xcite .",
    "we have performed this calculation for various @xmath10 values commensurate with starting triangular solids of @xmath100 layers at packing fraction @xmath93 .",
    "we found out the failure strains @xmath99 at each @xmath10 and plotted them in fig.[fails ] as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "this clearly shows that the failure strain reduces with increase in @xmath10 .",
    "this demonstrates the fact , derived earlier from monte - carlo simulations@xcite , that thinner ( smaller @xmath10 ) strips are stronger !     for various interwall separations",

    "the plot shows that the amount of overlap at the failure strains @xmath99 reduces with increasing @xmath10 indicating that at large interwall separations the system starts to behave as a bulk solid and more conventional modes of failure _ viz . _ through formation and interaction of cracks and twin boundaries starts becoming active .",
    "in this paper we have described how mechanical and phase behaviour are intimately related to each other for a narrow solid strip confined between hard walls . both may therefore be described using simple arguments based on density functional theory .",
    "the particles of the solid are assumed to interact via hard  -disk interactions apart from constrained hard  -sphere colloids@xcite where our results are directly testable , a similar fracture mechanism may be observable in experiments on the deformation of mono - layer nano beams or strips of real materials provided the confining channel is made of a material which is harder and has a much smaller atomic size than that of the strip@xcite .",
    "we believe that phase transition in confined systems , as described in this paper , may have future applications in nano - technology . the feature of reversible plasticity@xcite may be used to produce nano scale mechanical switches . for example ,",
    "thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity of such narrow strips after nucleation of smectic bands are expected to reduce drastically .",
    "these properties need to be investigated in detail . due to reversible plasticity",
    "a small change in strain in opposite directions can vary these properties of confined nano - strips giving rise to a possible use of it as mechanical switch in nano - devices .",
