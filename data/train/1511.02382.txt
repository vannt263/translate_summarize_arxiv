    "in the present work we make a comprehensive analysis of the symmetries and the dualities of the rnyi entanglement entropy for the ground state of quadratic , translational invariant fermionic hamiltonians with finite range couplings in a one - dimensional chain .",
    "we here focus on the case of non - critical , that is , gapped hamiltonians with reflection and charge conjugation symmetry .    for such hamiltonians ,",
    "the entanglement entropy associated with a partial observation on an interval of contiguous sites is a functional of the determinant of the @xmath0-point correlation matrix .",
    "this matrix is of the block toeplitz type @xcite .",
    "it was shown @xcite that by using riemann - hilbert problem techniques one can obtain the asymptotics of this determinant . furthermore , in the process of computing the asymptotics of the determinant one is led to cast the moduli of hamiltonians through their dispersion relations in terms of a compact riemann surface .",
    "the branch points of the hyperelliptic curve which defines this riemann surface depend on the coupling constants of the hamiltonian .",
    "our analysis of the symmetries and the dualities of the entanglement entropy is based on the study of the action of mbius transformations on the above riemann surface , which moves the branch points and , therefore , the coupling constants but leaves invariant the asymptotic expansion of the determinant of 2-point correlations and , therefore , the entanglement entropy .",
    "we then obtain the following collection of remarkable results :    1 .",
    "we uncover the fact that the entanglement entropy only depends on the mbius transformation invariants which are constructed with the branch points of the hyperelliptic curve associated with the couplings of the model .",
    "this fact explains the ellipses of constant entropy first noticed for the xy model in @xcite .",
    "we analyse which mbius transformations map the original couplings to other physically allowed , i.e. to other that preserve the hermiticity of the hamiltonian .",
    "we find that these mbius transformations are inversions and the 1 + 1 lorentz group , @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we observe that under @xmath1 the couplings change such that the dispersion relation behaves as a homogeneous field with scaling dimension equal to the maximum range @xmath2 of the coupling .",
    "we also note that the asymptotic expansion of the determinant is also invariant under certain permutations of the branch points which induce a modular transformation of the non contractible cycles of our riemann surface .",
    "this fact , combined with the previous invariance under mbius transformations , can be useful to find and analyse symmetries and dualities between different hamiltonians in terms of entanglement entropy .",
    "as an example , we apply this idea to the xy spin chain .",
    "in particular , the duality noticed in @xcite is discussed in terms of a dehn twist of the underlying riemann surface which in this xy case is a torus .",
    "recall that two distinct dehn twists , which are two special transformations of the moduli of the torus , generate the whole modular group in that case .",
    "the dehn twists play an important role in string theory , specially in the analysis of its many dualities .",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "another suggestive work is @xcite where the modular group is also used to understand the dualities of the xyz spin chain .",
    "4 .   this framework also allows to extend the relation between the entanglement entropy of two kramers - wannier dual ising models and its corresponding xx model , discussed by igloi and juhasz in @xcite , to general xy models .",
    "we organize this paper as follows . in section [ frh ]",
    "we first present the most general quadratic fermionic hamiltonian with long range couplings , reflection and charge conjugation symmetry , in a chain with @xmath3 sites . we next obtain the corresponding dispersion relation and then write a formula for the rnyi entanglement entropy in terms of the determinant of the @xmath0-point correlation matrix for the ground state . following the notorious works @xcite , we take the asymptotics of this determinant ( [ determinant ] ) by constructing a compact riemann surface from the coupling constants of the model .",
    "it is this riemann surface that will allow us to analyse the symmetries and dualities of the entanglement entropy based on its behaviour under the mbius transformations . in section [ mt - section ]",
    "we make a comprehensive analysis of the mbius transformations on the riemann surface associated with the moduli of coupling constants .",
    "we obtain that the entanglement entropy is left invariant , which allows us to obtain entropy preserving dualities between hamiltonians .",
    "furthermore , the only mbius transformations that preserve the properties of the riemann surface imposed by the couplings are inversion and the 1 + 1 lorentz group .",
    "a beautiful outcome of this result is that under the latter the dispersion relation itself behaves as a homogeneous field with scaling dimension associated with the maximum range @xmath2 of the couplings . in section [ xymodel - section ]",
    "we apply our general results of previous section to the xy model .",
    "we are then able to uncover the geometrical origin of some dualities already noticed in @xcite and to generalize them .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ conclusion - section ] by summarizing our findings and discussing some prospects for the future .",
    "this paper also contains two appendices . in appendix [ det - invariance - app ]",
    ", we show that the determinant of our block toeplitz matrix is invariant under permutation of the branch points defining the riemann surface . in appendix",
    "[ vilenkin - app ] , we recollect the important facts concerning the representation of @xmath4 on the space of homogeneous polynomials of two complex variables .",
    "this plays a crucial role in the understanding how the hamiltonian , and in particular its couplings constants , change under mbius transformations .",
    "let us consider a @xmath3-site chain of size @xmath5 with @xmath3 spinless fermions described by a quadratic , translational invariant hamiltonian with finite range couplings ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the annihilation and creation operators at the site @xmath10 .",
    "the only non - vanishing anticommutation relations are @xmath11 we assume periodic boundary conditions @xmath12 in ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "we take @xmath13 and @xmath14 real , and in order that @xmath15 is hermitian , the hopping couplings must be symmetric @xmath16 .",
    "in addition , without loss of generality , we may take @xmath17 . for a comprehensive analysis of more general choices of couplings @xmath13 and @xmath14 see @xcite .",
    "proceeding like in @xcite we introduce @xmath18 and @xmath19 note that in our case , @xmath20 is real and @xmath21 while @xmath22 is imaginary and @xmath23 .",
    "the hamiltonian can now be written in diagonal form by means of anticommuting annihilation , creation operators @xmath24 , the bogoliubov transform of the fourier modes , @xmath25 where @xmath26 the dispersion relation reads @xmath27 which takes non - negative values .",
    "hence the ground state of the theory @xmath28 is the vacuum of the fock space for the @xmath29 modes , i.e. @xmath30 , @xmath31 .    in this paper",
    "we focus our study in the rnyi entanglement entropy for the ground state of hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .    given a subset @xmath32 of contiguous sites of the fermionic chain , with complementary set @xmath33 we have the corresponding factorization of the hilbert space @xmath34 .",
    "if the system is in the pure state @xmath35 , the reduced density matrix for @xmath32 is obtained by taking the partial trace with respect to @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the rnyi entanglement entropy of @xmath32 is @xmath38    as it is well known @xcite , due to the fact that the @xmath10-point vacuum expectation value satisfies the wick decomposition property , it is possible to derive the reduced density matrix from the two point correlation function .",
    "namely , for any pair of sites @xmath39 , we introduce the correlation matrix @xmath40    following @xcite one can show that the rnyi entanglement entropy reads @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the @xmath43 identity matrix and @xmath44 denotes the size of @xmath32 .",
    "the cauchy s residue theorem allows us to implement ( [ entcorrel ] ) as @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47,\\ ] ] and @xmath48 is the contour depicted in fig .",
    "[ contorno0 ] which surrounds the eigenvalues @xmath49 of @xmath50 , all of them lying in the real interval @xmath51 $ ] .",
    "applying to our case the results in @xcite one can show that @xmath52 with @xmath53 we now consider the thermodynamic limit , @xmath54 , @xmath55 with @xmath56 fixed . in this limit",
    "the previous @xmath3-tuples , like @xmath57 and the others , with @xmath58 , become @xmath59-periodic functions of the continuous variable @xmath60 , that is , @xmath61 .    in order to obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the entanglement entropy ( [ entintegr ] ) , we must compute @xmath62 when the size @xmath44 of @xmath32 is large .",
    "this task was solved in @xcite by reducing it to a particular wiener - hopf factorization problem . to describe the result",
    "we introduce the ( complex ) laurent polynomials @xmath63 that are related to @xmath64 and @xmath65 , from ( [ fk - def-1 ] ) and ( [ gk - def-1 ] ) , by @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in terms of ( [ laurent ] ) we extend the symbol @xmath68 to the complex plane @xmath69 with @xmath70 and @xmath71    now , as it is shown in @xcite , the asymptotic behaviour of the logarithmic derivative of @xmath72 verifies @xmath73{\\rm d}z + \\dots\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the solution to the following * wiener - hopf * factorization problem :    \\i ) @xmath76 ,    \\ii ) with @xmath77 analytic outside the unit circle and @xmath78 analytic inside .",
    "this problem has been solved in @xcite and the results , expressed in terms of theta functions associated to the riemann surface determined by @xmath79 , are described in the following .",
    "first , consider the analytic structure of @xmath79 .",
    "actually it is a bivalued function in the complex plane , but it is a single valued meromorphic function in the riemann surface determined by the complex curve @xmath80 where @xmath81 denotes the riemann sphere .    here we shall assume that the polynomial @xmath82 has @xmath83 different simple roots and therefore ( [ riemann ] ) defines a two - sheet riemann surface of genus @xmath84 . on the other hand , since the real coupling constants of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) satisfy @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 therefore if @xmath88 is a root of @xmath82 then @xmath89 and @xmath90 are roots as well . actually",
    "the roots of @xmath82 coincide with the zeros and poles of the rational function @xmath91 and the previous relation specializes as follows : if @xmath88 is a zero ( pole ) of @xmath91 then @xmath89 is also a zero ( pole ) while @xmath90 is a pole ( zero ) .",
    "we fix an order in the roots of @xmath82 with the only requierement that the first half of them is inside the unit circle and the other half outside , i.e. @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( notice that if all roots are simple , then necessarily @xmath94 ) .    equipped with the previous data we fix the branch cuts of @xmath79 , which are @xmath95 non intersecting curves @xmath96 that join @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "notice that it is always possible to choose them such that they do not cross the unit circle .    associated to these cuts we have a canonical homology basis of cycles in the riemann surface @xmath99 where @xmath100 , in the upper riemann sheet , surrounds @xmath101 anticlockwise and the dual cycle @xmath102 surrounds the branch points @xmath103 clockwise . in fig .",
    "[ cuts ] we depict a possible arrangement of the branch points and cuts for @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) as well as cycles @xmath106 and @xmath107 .    the canonical basis of holomorphic forms @xmath108 with @xmath109 a polynomial of degree smaller than @xmath110 , is chosen so that @xmath111 .",
    "the @xmath112 symmetric matrix of periods @xmath113 is given by @xmath114 associated with this matrix of periods we can now define the riemann theta - function with characteristics @xmath115 , @xmath116 , given by @xmath117 and its _ normalized _ version @xmath118    finally , one has the following expression for the asymptotic value of the determinant ( adapted from proposition 1 of @xcite ) : @xmath119 where the dots represent terms that vanish in the large @xmath44 limit .",
    "the argument of the theta function contains @xmath120 and @xmath121 , a @xmath110 dimensional vector whose first @xmath122 entries are 0 and the last @xmath2 are 1 .",
    "the characteristics of the theta function are half integer vectors @xmath123 which are determined as follows : first assign an index @xmath124 to every root @xmath88 of @xmath82 , so that @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) if @xmath88 is a zero ( pole ) of @xmath91 ; then the vectors are @xmath127 note that the indices must satisfy @xmath128 whenever @xmath129 and @xmath130 if @xmath131 .    in order to give an explicit expression for the determinant",
    "we have fixed an order of the roots with the only requirement that the @xmath95 first ones are inside the unit circle and the last ones outside . of course , for consistency ( [ determinant ] ) should not depend on the chosen order .",
    "actually it is an instructive exercise to show that the value of the determinant ( in the thermodynamic limit ) is in fact invariant under the transposition of two roots , provided they sit at the same side of the unit circle . in appendix [ det - invariance - app ]",
    "we outline a proof of this fact .",
    "if we now perform a holomorphic bijective transformation in the riemann sphere , @xmath132 , we move the branch points and cuts , thus modifying the holomorphic forms .",
    "but it is clear that the matrix of periods is unchanged .",
    "therefore the theta function does not change and the entropy derived from ( [ determinant ] ) is left invariant .",
    "it is a mathematical fact that the only holomorphic one - to - one maps of the riemann sphere into itself are the mbius transformations @xmath133 they act , see appendix [ vilenkin - app ] , on the laurent polynomial @xmath134 by @xmath135 which is again a laurent polynomial with monomials of degree between @xmath2 and @xmath136 .",
    "hence , the mbius transformation can be seen as a change of the couplings from @xmath13 to @xmath137 . in exactly the same way we transform @xmath138 with coefficients @xmath14 to a new @xmath139 with coefficients @xmath140 .",
    "notice that if we use the new laurent polynomials to get the new rational function @xmath141 we have @xmath142 .",
    "but this is not the end of the story because as we mentioned in the previous section , the roots of @xmath82 ( [ riemann ] ) satisfy certain properties , namely they come in quartets @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath143 . in order to preserve this property",
    ", we must require that the mbius transformation commute with the complex conjugation and inversion .",
    "the commutation with conjugation restricts @xmath144 to the semidirect product @xmath145 .",
    "these are the transformations that preserve the real line .",
    "note that the second factor in the semidirect product is related to the inversion @xmath146 and maps the upper half plane into the lower one while the first factor contains the transformations that map the upper half plane to itself .",
    "if we further impose that the allowed transformations must commute with the inversion , we are finally left with the group generated by the reflection @xmath146 and the 1 + 1 lorentz group @xmath1 whose elements act on @xmath74 by @xmath147 this is precisely the subgroup of the mbius tranformations that preserve the unit circle and the real line .",
    "its connected component maps the upper half plane and the unit disc into themselves .",
    "we unraveled the symmetry by considering the final expression for the asymptotic determinant ( [ determinant ] ) , but one can trace back its origin to the wiener - hopf factorization problem described in the previous section .",
    "in fact , assume we perform a mbius transformation that preserve the unit circle mapping its exterior into its exterior and the interior into the interior .",
    "then , the property of being analytic outside ( inside ) the circle is preserved which implies that the solution to the wiener - hopf factorization for @xmath148 is transformed into that for @xmath149 . inserting it into ( [ wiener - hopf ] )",
    "one immediately sees that the logarithmic derivative of @xmath72 and hence the entanglement entropy , are unchanged , at least in the asymptotic limit .",
    "actually , a similar reasoning shows that the determinant is invariant for any mbius transformation provided it keeps inside ( outside ) the unit circle the branching points that were originally inside ( outside ) .    as for the physical interpretation of the transformations",
    ", the inversion corresponds to reverting the orientation in the chain @xmath150 which , clearly , does not affect the entropy of the system .",
    "the coupling constants transform in a very simple way , namely , @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",
    "the symmetries in the lorentz group , however , have a rather non trivial implementation . in appendix",
    "b we shall discuss in full generality how the coupling constants of the hamiltonian behave under such lorentz transformations .",
    "on the other hand , it is interesting to observe that these particular mbius transformations leave invariant not only the von neumann entropy but also the rnyi entanglement entropy ( [ renyi - ent-1 ] ) for any value of @xmath153 .",
    "actually , all the spectral properties of the two - point correlation function are preserved , at least in the large @xmath44 limit .",
    "a very important observation is that all the previous does not apply for the critical , gapless theories , i.e. when couples of roots of @xmath82 coincide at the unit circle .",
    "this important case will be studied separately in a future publication @xcite .    with respect to the dynamical aspects of these transformations , we may say that they are not a symmetry of the hamiltonian . in the thermodynamic limit they act as a rescaling of the spectrum .",
    "actually , as the unit circle is mapped into itself , we may view the transformation as a change in the momentum of the modes together with a rescaling of its energy . more concretely , adopting again the active view point we have @xmath154 where @xmath155 is the image of @xmath60 under the mbius transformation , @xmath156 and , therefore , @xmath157 interestingly enough under the above transformations the dispersion relation @xmath158 behaves as a homogeneous field of dimension @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the dimension is directly associated with the range of the coupling .",
    "we recall that such a transformation actually corresponds to a change of the coupling constants of the theory .",
    "the action of @xmath1 in @xmath81 has two fixed points in @xmath159 .",
    "in particular , @xmath160 is stable and @xmath161 is unstable , so all the flow lines of the transformation depart from the first one and they join in the second one as we sketch in fig .",
    "[ flow ] .",
    "if one considers the induced flow in the space of hamiltonians the picture is richer .",
    "there exist @xmath162 fixed points whose associated complex curves are @xmath163 the only stable one corresponds to @xmath164 .",
    "the other fixed points have a @xmath165-dimensional unstable manifold . of course",
    ", all these hamiltonians correspond to critical theories .    summarizing",
    ", we have found a transformation of the coupling constants of a free fermionic chain with finite range coupling such that the spectral properties of the two - point correlation function are left invariant in the thermodynamic limit , provided the theory has a mass gap . as a byproduct we show that the asymptotic behaviour of the rnyi entanglement entropy is unchanged , whenever it is finite . on the other hand ,",
    "the modes in the one particle energy spectrum are rescaled with a dimension given by the range of the couplings of the theory .",
    "the connected component of the symmetry group is composed by the mbius transformations associated to the 1 + 1 lorentz subgroup @xmath1 .    here we have only focused in a single connected interval .",
    "it is natural to take several disjoint intervals @xcite . in this case",
    "the situation is more involved because the correlation matrix of the subsystem is no longer of the block toeplitz type .",
    "nevertheless , our preliminary numeric computations suggest that the formulae obtained in @xcite are still valid in this case",
    ". this would imply that the mbius symmetry also holds when @xmath32 is made of several disjoint intervals .",
    "our first application of the transformations introduced in the previous section is to understand the different dualities and invariances of the entanglement entropy in the xy model .",
    "this has been studied in @xcite .",
    "here we rederive their results and find some new ones using the ideas of the previous section .",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath166.\\ ] ] the coupling constants @xmath167 and @xmath168 are assumed to be real and positive .",
    "a jordan - wigner transformation allows us to write this hamiltonian in terms of fermionic operators , namely @xmath169+\\frac{nh}{2},\\ ] ] which is a particular case of the hamiltonian of ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with nearest neighbours coupling , @xmath170 .",
    "we are now set to apply the previous results .",
    "the laurent polynomials are in this case @xmath171 and the dispersion relation is @xmath172 the theory is gapless for @xmath173 ( ising universality class ) or @xmath174 ( xx universality class ) .",
    "the zeros of @xmath175 are given by @xmath176 and its poles are the inverses @xmath177 .",
    "note that the critical theories correspond to the value of the couplings for which some of the zeros are in the complex unit circle .",
    "here we do not discuss the case of critical theories , which deserves a special treatment @xcite .",
    "our focus here is on the non - critical theories , its symmetries , dualities and other properties .",
    "if we now apply the transformations ( [ mymoebius ] ) the couplings of the theory change as @xmath178 while the zeros change as @xmath179 and similarly for the poles .    actually , as it was discussed in the previous section , the entropy derived from ( [ entintegr ] ) and ( [ determinant ] ) is invariant under any mbius transformation of the riemann surface .",
    "therefore it only depends on the zeros and poles of @xmath91 through the mbius invariants . for the xy model in which we have just four such points (",
    "two zeros @xmath180 and two poles @xmath181 ) the only invariants are functions of the cross ratio @xmath182 if we use ( [ roots ] ) , this cross ratio can be written in terms of the couplings as @xmath183 the explicit form of the von neumann entanglement entropy for non - critical xy model was computed in @xcite and it was rewritten in @xcite in terms of the parameter @xmath184 .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "we express the von neumann entropy in three distinct regions , namely 1a , 1b and 2 :    * region 1a : @xmath185 .",
    "@xmath186+\\log 2.\\ ] ] * region 1b : @xmath187 . @xmath188+\\log 2.\\ ] ] * region 2 : @xmath189 .",
    "@xmath190.\\ ] ]    here @xmath191 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind @xmath192 as it was discussed before , the fact that the entropy depends solely of the parameter @xmath184 can be derived as a consequence of the mbius invariance that we uncover in this paper .",
    "a consequence of such invariance is that the rnyi entropy is a function of @xmath184 as well . in the following",
    "we will use the mbius transformations to study some dualities and other relations that occur between theories in the different regions we introduce above .",
    "examining the expressions of the entropy in the region 1 , ( [ region1a ] ) and ( [ region1b ] ) , it is clear that the entropy is invariant under the change of @xmath184 to @xmath193 .",
    "we would like to understand this property in the light of the symmetries discussed before .",
    "in fact we may derive the duality in the following way .",
    "assume we start with a theory with couplings @xmath194 in the region 1a , i.e. , @xmath195 .",
    "therefore , the points @xmath196 and @xmath197 are two real zeros inside the unit circle .",
    "imagine now that we permute them without permuting their inverses . as it was discussed in section [ frh",
    "] , see also appendix [ det - invariance - app ] , the permutation between zeros on the same side of the unit circle does not affect the entropy , however the cross ratio ( [ crossratio ] ) is now inverted : @xmath198 .",
    "note that from the point of view of the corresponding riemann surface , which in this case is a torus , this permutation of zeros is equivalent to cut it along the @xmath199-cycle , perform a @xmath59 rotation of one of the borders , and glue them again .",
    "this is precisely one of the two dehn twists that generate the modular group @xmath200 of the torus .",
    "one may object that the roots in the new pairs @xmath201 and @xmath202 are not related by inversion any more , as it should be in the xy model . here",
    "is where the mbius transformations come to the rescue . by suitably chosing a @xmath144 transformation that does not belong to @xmath1 ,",
    "it is posible to transform the two pairs above into @xmath203 and @xmath204 with the additional property @xmath205 .",
    "considering now that the mbius transformations leave the entropy invariant , we can explain the duality between ( [ region1a ] ) and ( [ region1b ] ) . in particular , one may take as mbius transformation that for which @xmath206    these roots actually correspond to a particular choice of the couplings for the xy model , @xmath207 , belonging to region 1b , which can be related to the original ones by @xmath208 in figure [ phase_diagram_xy ] , we depict graphically in the plane @xmath209 this choice : the point @xmath210 has coordinates @xmath211 and @xmath212 , with coordinates @xmath213 , is its dual .",
    "it should be noticed that the duality , that is manifest for von neumann also holds for the rnyi entropy ( [ entintegr ] ) , as it is based on the equality of the determinants @xmath72 for the two values of the couplings . on the other hand , in order to establish the duality we must perform a mbius transformation , which implies that the dispersion relation has changed as a homogeneous field of dimension @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , in this case the spectrum of the hamiltonian transforms non trivialy .    before proceeding",
    "we examine for the xy model how the expressions for a general riemann surface specializes to one with genus 1 . in this case",
    "the riemann theta function in @xmath110 complex variables reduces to the elliptic theta function with characteristics in one variable @xmath214 .",
    "the period matrix @xmath215 is replaced by the modulus @xmath216 defined by @xmath217 with @xmath218 and the order chosen for the zeros and poles of @xmath91 is @xmath219 @xmath220 @xmath221 that fulfills in all cases the requirement of the previous section , i. e. the first two branch points are inside the unit circle and the last two outside .",
    "consequently , the assignement of indices is @xmath222 for the cases 1a , 1b and @xmath223 for the case 2 .",
    "now , one can easily compute the characteristics to give @xmath224 for cases 1a , 1b and @xmath225 in case 2 .",
    "we derived above a duality for the entanglement entropy that was based in the exchange of the two zeros on the same side of the unit circle .",
    "this does not change the riemann surface , nor the characteristics , and leaves the entropy invariant .",
    "another duality that preserves the riemann surface is the exchange of a real root with its inverse .",
    "this establishes a relation between the regions 1a and 2 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath226 .",
    "the relation between the coupling constants is then , @xmath227 in figure [ phase_diagram_xy ] , the point @xmath228 in region 2 is the dual of @xmath210 .",
    "one immediately obtains that under this duality , the dispersion relation changes as @xmath229 which implies that up to a trivial rescaling the spectrum of the hamiltonian is unchanged . for the particular value @xmath230 , in which xy reduces to the ising model ,",
    "the dual theory is also the ising model ( @xmath231 ) with a different magnetic field . in this case",
    "this duality coincides with the kramers - wannier duality @xcite which , as it is notoriously known , is very useful for determining the critical point of the ising model @xcite .",
    "if we now consider the behaviour of the entropy under the duality , we observe that the riemann surface does not change and henceforth the modulus @xmath216 is invariant .",
    "however , as it was discussed above , the characteristics are transformed from @xmath232 to @xmath233 and therefore @xmath72 and the entropy are modified .",
    "this duality can be generalized to hamiltonians of higher range @xmath2 .",
    "we can exchange one real zero of @xmath91 by its inverse , which is a pole of @xmath91 , or one complex zero of @xmath91 and its complex conjugate by their inverses , which are poles of @xmath91 . then",
    "both the riemann surface and the spectrum of the hamiltonian remain invariant .",
    "however , the characteristics change and then entanglement entropy varies too .",

    "a beautiful result is that although the two dual theories in regions 1a and 2 have different entanglement entropies , they can be combined to obtain the entropy of a hamiltonian in the region 1b .",

    "our results extend this property to other points in the coupling space .    in order to proceed , recall the useful identity of theta functions @xcite that combines the two dual theories , @xmath235 if we apply this identity for @xmath236 to the expression ( [ determinant ] ) for the determinant we deduce that by summing up the rnyi entanglement entropy for two dual theories , like those with coupling constants @xmath237 and @xmath238 which ( see ( [ tau - hg ] ) and the previous section ) correspond to the same modulus @xmath216 , we can obtain the rnyi entropy of a third theory in the region @xmath239 with coupling constants @xmath240 such that its modulus is @xmath241 .    in particular , we may take @xmath242 with @xmath243 then if we introduce @xmath244 , by application of ( [ equx ] ) , ( [ tau - hg ] ) we obtain @xmath245 and using the following landen identities for elliptic functions @xcite , @xmath246 we obtain @xmath247 as we claimed .",

    "if we take @xmath256 and @xmath258 , the other two related models have coupling constants @xmath259 , @xmath260 , @xmath261 and @xmath262 . before writing explicitly the relation of the entanglement entropies",
    "we must consider that we are dealing with critical theories , which implies that the entropy of an interval @xmath32 scales logarithmically with its length @xmath44 . as we did for the finite size case , in order to recover the additive relation between the entropies in the critical case , we must take different length intervals for the different theories , namely @xmath263 this is an interesting relation because , combined with the results of @xcite for the xx model , it allows to compute the rnyi entanglement entropy for the critical ising universality class ( @xmath256 ) .",

    "we have seen in this work the importance of casting the space of coupling constants of a model in terms of a riemann surface .",
    "this simple fact shows up when we are computing the asymptotics of the determinant of the @xmath0-point correlation matrix of the model .",
    "the next observation is that this determinant is kept invariant under mbius transformations acting on the riemann surface that , on the other hand , change the value of the couplings . therefore we can have changes in the hamiltonian that leave the determinant invariant .",
    "this fact allows us to uncover the origin and set up in a unified language the symmetries and dualities of such models .",

    "this requires some other techniques since , because of the confluence of couples of branch points in the unit circle , new singularities appear .",

    "one could consider the case of several disjoint intervals , as mentioned at the end of section [ mt - section ] , or take complex coupling constants that break reflection and charge conjugation symmetry @xcite .",
