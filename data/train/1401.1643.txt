    "primordial black holes ( pbhs ) are a very sensitive cosmological probe for physics phenomena occurring in the early universe",
    ". they could be formed by many different mechanisms , reflecting the fundamental structure of particle theory and nonhomogeneity of very early universe . here after a brief review of mechanisms of pbh formation we consider a nontrivial possibility of clusters of massive pbhs .",
    "the evolution of such clusters can provide pregalactic seeds of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and we discuss various aspects of this evolution in the present paper .",
    "primordial black holes can be formed in many different ways  @xcite , such as initial density inhomogeneities , first order and non - equilibrium second order phase transitions , etc .",
    "let us give a brief review of these possibilities .",
    "a probability for fluctuation of   1 for metric fluctuations distributed according to gaussian law with dispersion @xmath0 is determined by exponentially small tail of high amplitude part of this distribution . in non - gaussian fluctuations ,",
    "this process can be more suppressed  @xcite . in the space , described by @xmath1 equation of state a probability to form black hole from fluctuation within cosmological horizon",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath2 it provides exponential sensitivity of pbh spectrum to softening of equation of state in early universe ( @xmath3 ) or to increase of ultraviolet part of spectrum of density fluctuations ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "these phenomena can appear as cosmological consequence of particle theory ( see  @xcite for review of this and some other mechanisms of pbh formation and for references ) .",
    "the mechanism of pbh formation in the non - equilibrium second order phase transition is of special interest , since it can provide formation of massive and even supermassive pbhs .",
    "pbhs are produced in this mechanism by self - collapsing of closed domain walls .",
    "if there are two vacuum states of a system , there are two possibilities to populate that states in the early universe : under the usual circumstances of thermal phase transition the universe contains both states populated with equal probability .",
    "the other possibility is beyond the pure thermodynamical equilibrium condition , when the two vacuum states are populated with islands of the less probable vacuum , surrounded by the sea of another , more preferable , vacuum .",
    "it is necessary to redefine effectively the correlation length of the scalar field that drives a phase transition and consequently the formation of topological defects and the only necessary ingredient for that is the existence of an effectively flat direction(s ) , along which the scalar potential vanishes during inflation .    the background desitter fluctuations of such effectively massless scalar field could provide non - equilibrium redefinition of correlation length and give rise to the islands of one vacuum in the sea of another one . in spite of such redefinition",
    "the phase transition itself takes place deeply in the friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) epoch .",
    "after the phase transition two vacua are separated by a wall , and such a closed wall , separating the island with the less probable vacuum , can be very large .    at some moment after crossing horizon",
    "the walls start shrinking due to surface tension . as a result , if the wall does not release the significant fraction of its energy in the form of outward scalar waves , almost the whole energy of such closed wall can be concentrated in a small volume within its gravitational radius what is the necessary condition for pbh formation .",
    "the mass spectrum of the pbhs which can be created by such a way depends on the scalar field potential which parameterizes the flat direction during inflation and triggers the phase transition at the frw stage .",
    "we consider the universe that , due to the existence of an inflaton , goes through a period of inflation and then settles down to the standard frw geometry .",
    "then we introduce a complex scalar field @xmath5 , not the inflaton , with a large radial mass @xmath6 that has got mexican hat potential @xmath7 which provides the u(1 ) symmetry spontaneous breaking in the period of inflation , corresponding to the scales of the modern cosmological horizon . therefore we deal only with the phase of that complex field @xmath8 , which parameterizes potential @xmath9 under this condition we come to the conclusion , that the correlation length of second order phase transition with spontaneously broken u(1 ) symmetry exceeds the present cosmological horizon , and all global u(1 ) strings are beyond our horizon .",
    "if we assume @xmath10 then this implies that during inflation the potential energy of field @xmath5 is much smaller than the cosmological friction term what justifies neglecting the potential until the universe goes deeply into the frw phase . during inflation and long afterward",
    ", @xmath11 is very large ( by assumption ) compared to the potential ( 2 ) .",
    "it follows that we can drop the gradient term in the equation of motion  @xcite @xmath12 and resulting equation is solved by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is an arbitrary constant . in the standard assumption",
    ", our present horizon has been nucleated at the @xmath15 e - folds before the end of inflationary epoch , being embedded in an enormous inflation horizon , created by exponential blow up of a single casual horizon .",
    "it follows that @xmath14 will be the same over the inter inflationary horizon . without loss of generality",
    ", we put @xmath16 and considering the quantum fluctuations of the phase @xmath17 at the desitter background .",
    "there are quantum fluctuations produced on the vacuum state of @xmath17 due to the boundary conditions of desitter space .",
    "these fluctuations are sometimes referred to as contribution to the `` hawking temperature '' of desitter space but , there are no true thermal effects .",
    "it makes the dynamics of phase @xmath17 strongly non - equilibrium leading to the non - thermal distribution of scales populated with different vacuums in the postinflationary universe .",
    "the average amplitude of such fluctuations for massless field generated during each time interval @xmath18 is @xmath19 .",
    "the total number of steps during time interval @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 - looks like the one - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "each domain is characterized by average phase value @xmath22 .    in the half of these domains",
    "the phases evolve toward @xmath23 while in the other domains they move toward zero .",
    "this process is duplicated in each volume of size @xmath24 during next e - fold .",
    "now at any given scale @xmath25 the size of distribution of the phase value @xmath17 can be described by gaussian law  @xcite @xmath26 it is recommended for more information to address the papers  @xcite .",
    "initial mass spectrum @xmath27 depends of parameter @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite in addition , is a numerical solution .",
    "there is another way : one can describe this system by ito s equation .",
    "one - dimensional brownian motion in the terms of stochastic equations is an ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "@xcite using this mathematical framework , one can find the analytical solution of ito s equation and obtain initial mass spectrum as an analytical formula @xmath30 .",
    "this method is in the process of development .",
    "according to the @xmath31 order phase transitions mechanism , pbh appears as a sufficiently large cluster , which could collapse into one large super massive black hole ( smbh ) - the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) of the future galaxy .      by analogy with the star cluster  @xcite with the difference",
    "that the black holes can merge into one , the following processes are significant :    * bh collisions @xmath32 merging and as a result @xmath33 * flying - out bh from cluster @xmath34 reducing the mass of the cluster  @xcite * dynamical friction @xmath34 lower maxwell distribution  @xcite    dynamical friction mostly contributes into the @xmath35 of the collision process .",
    "@xcite the equation describing the dynamics of the bh cluster is a modification of smoluchowski ( or kolmogorov - feller ) equation and runs as follows @xmath36 where m is total initial cluster mass , @xmath37 one can find in  @xcite .",
    "let us consider numerical solution of that equation for arbitrary initial parameters :   + numerical solution of that equation shows , that there is the  trend \" to the decrease of bhs with larger masses .",
    "however , the numerical solution is indispensable because of the unknown initial parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 of the model .",
    "exact analytical solution of that equation is overly precise and is a very nontrivial exercise .",
    "if a single smbh is supposed to be the result , one needs to get a solution of that equation as @xmath38 substituting this partial solution into the equation of the pbh cluster dynamics , one can obtain the timescale of the process and the mass of the resulting smbh as a functionals of initial conditions : @xmath39\\ ] ] @xmath40\\ ] ] the calculated values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be confronted with the observational data , putting constraints on the fundamental physical scales @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
