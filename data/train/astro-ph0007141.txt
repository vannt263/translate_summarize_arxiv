    "the study of statistical gravitational lensing effects on large numbers of source galaxies due to intervening matter has been a subject of major and rapid progress both from the methodological and from the observational point of view ( e.g. , see kaiser & squires 1993 ; luppino & kaiser 1997 ; taylor et al .",
    "1998 ; lombardi & bertin 1998a , b , hereafter paper  i , ii ) .",
    "this indeed offers a very promising approach to study the overall mass distribution , especially on the scale of clusters of galaxies .",
    "in fact , the most appealing aspect of this line of research is its diagnostic potential , with the possibility to measure mass distributions independently of the traditional tools that have to rely on the use of dynamical models .",
    "the interest in this method has gained further momentum from the most recent developments of telescopes and instrumentation .",
    "very deep images are now bringing in accurate data that allow us to analyze the shape of thousands of galaxies , with a density of nearly @xmath0 already reached ( see hoekstra et al .",
    "the use of information from so many sources makes it possible to measure very small lensing effects , which would have been beyond expectation just a few years ago .",
    "the work in this area is thus mostly addressing two directions . on the methodological side ,",
    "the main hope is to develop mass reconstruction algorithms that are simple , flexible , and reliable , with full control of the errors involved in the procedure that goes from the shear data to the inferred properties of the lens ( see , e.g. , bartelmann et al .",
    "1996 ; seitz & schneider 1997 ; paper  i ; paper  ii ) .",
    "on the side of data analysis , a variety of important issues have to be properly faced and addressed , in order to secure accurate shape measurements as free as possible from all the undesired or spurious distortions that are associated with the instrument and with the observation conditions ( kaiser , squires , & broadhurst 1995 ) .    within this general pespective , the present paper belongs to a third direction of research , i.e.  the study of potentially interesting effects and phenomena , such as the lensing associated with gravity waves ( kaiser & jaffe 1997 ) or cosmological applications where gravitational lensing probes the geometry of the universe ( kaiser 1998 ; lombardi & bertin 1999 , paper  iii ; van waerbeke , bernardeau , & mellier 1999 ) .",
    "measuring these effects , admittedly at the limits of current observations , is expected to become feasible with the advent of the next generation telescopes .",
    "the theory of double lenses has already been subject to some progress .",
    "for example , it has been proven that multiple lenses produce an odd number of images from a pointlike source ( seitz & schneider 1992 ) and that a simple theorem on the magnification of images holds ( seitz & schneider 1994 ) , while crawford et al .",
    "( 1986 ) have discussed the probability that a quasar is strongly lensed by two clusters . however",
    ", this still remains a challenging line of research that is so far largely unexplored ; in particular , the problem has not been discussed , to our knowledge , in the important context of weak lensing analyses .",
    "attracted by the new developments in deep imaging and especially in the observation of very distant clusters of galaxies , which already suggest that a chance alignment of two clusters is not to be considered an unlikely event ( for example , see the case of cl@xmath1 noted by molinari , buzzoni , & chincarini 1996 , and of a@xmath2 reported by wang & ulmer 1997 ) , we found it natural to give further thought to such lens configurations .    in this paper , for the context of weak lensing , we generalize the procedure to extract the astrophysical information contained in the observed shear field from the case of a single lens to that of a double lens .",
    "we start by showing how the trace and the asymmetric part of the jacobian matrix associated with the ray - tracing transformation can be measured ( sect .  2 and sect .",
    "3 ) , once the observed ellipticities of a large number of background galaxies have been properly secured .",
    "we then consider some explicit questions that can be tackled in configurations of astrophysical interest ; in particular , we formulate and address a `` dark cluster problem , '' corresponding to the situation where the signature of double lensing is observed at variance with the apparent absence of a second bright cluster partially aligned along the line of sight ( sect .",
    "we then estimate the size of the effects involved ( sect .",
    "5 ) , so that we can state that , based on the known properties of the distribution of bright clusters , a few configurations are likely to be present in the sky , for which the small effects characteristic of double lensing may already be within detection limits . surprisingly , a discussion of the relevant contributions to the noise of the shear measurement reveals an intrinsic limitation of weak lensing analyses .",
    "in fact , we find that the noise contribution associated with the two - galaxy cosmological correlation function does not decrease with the depth of the observation .",
    "a quantitative evaluation of this subtle effect and of its impact on mass reconstructions deserves a separate investigation and will be considered in a future paper . some numerical tests in sect .",
    "6 demonstrate that the analytical framework developed is sound and bring out the existence of some curious effects ( especially on the criticality condition for a double lens and on the possibility of pinpointing the location of the invisible cluster in the dark cluster problem ) .",
    "then , simulations in the same section show that the redshift distribution of the source galaxies , which in principle might also contribute to break the curl - free character of the shear field , actually produces systematic effects typically two orders of magnitude smaller than the double lensing effects we are focusing on .",
    "in addition , they suggest that reasonable assumptions on the observed galaxies lead to noise levels that do not mar the possibility of detecting the double - lensing effect . even if , at present , much of what we have obtained is barely within the limits of direct experimental confirmation , with the advent of new instrumentation ( such as acs on hst ) and powerful telescopes of the next generation ( such as ngst ) the observational impact of analyses of the type provided here is bound to become significant .",
    "in this section we briefly recall the lensing equations for double lenses , in the context where the lensing is produced by intervening clusters . for the purpose",
    ", we mostly follow schneider , ehlers , & falco ( 1992 ) , with some small differences of notation ( see also paper  iii ) .",
    "we then summarize the principles of the statistical analysis that leads to a local measurement of the gravitational shear .",
    "let us consider for the moment a single source at redshift @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be the angular diameter distance between two aligned objects at redshift @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ( with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) the distances between two of the elements of the lens configuration , made of observer ( o ) , two deflector planes ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , and source plane ( s ) .",
    "we call @xmath12 ( or simply @xmath13 ) the apparent position of the source , so that @xmath14 is the corresponding linear position on the first deflector plane .",
    "the light ray is traced back to angular positions @xmath15 and @xmath16 referred to the second deflector and to the source ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "in the following we will use the notation @xmath17 for @xmath18 .",
    "the `` dynamics '' of the two lenses is contained in two deflection functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 , such that @xmath21 thus the _ ray - tracing equation _ can be written as @xmath22 with ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24 and @xmath25    for given projected mass distributions of the two lenses @xmath26 , the distances @xmath27 enter the problem through @xmath28 and through the two critical densities , defined as @xmath29 the definition of @xmath30 for @xmath31 just states that foreground sources are unaffected by the lens .",
    "the functions @xmath32 can be expressed by suitable integrals of the two reduced densities @xmath33 . for cases of interest , @xmath28 is smaller than unity .",
    "note that , much like in the case of a single lens , since distances enter only through the ratios @xmath34 and @xmath35 , for a family of very distant sources the ray - tracing equation   can be applied without explicit reference to the distance of each source , and @xmath28 remains finite .",
    "if the sources are located at different redshifts but not all of them are at large distance , we can still retain a form similar to eq .",
    "for the ray - tracing equation provided we introduce the appropriate _ cosmological weight functions _ : @xmath36 the functions @xmath37 give the strength of the lens @xmath38 on a source at redshift @xmath39 relative to a source at redshift @xmath3 .",
    "[ note that in paper  iii we used a similar definition of cosmological weight function , but took the `` reference '' redshift @xmath3 at infinity . here",
    "we prefer to avoid the limit @xmath40 . ] with this definition , eq .   can be rewritten as @xmath41    an important qualitative aspect of the two - lens ray - tracing equation is the following . in the limit where @xmath42 , the ray - tracing equation adds two contributions , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , each deriving from a potential , so that the related jacobian matrix @xmath45 is symmetric . in turn , when @xmath46 , the jacobian matrix is no longer guaranteed to be symmetric ( in fact , the product of two symmetric matrices is not necessarily symmetric ) .",
    "the limit @xmath47 occurs when the two deflectors are very close to each other .    in the _ weak lensing limit _",
    "the jacobian matrix is considered to be close to the identity matrix , @xmath48 , with the parameter @xmath49 measuring the strength of the lens .",
    "equation   readily shows that for two lenses of comparable strength one expects a very small asymmetry in the jacobian matrix , with @xmath50 . in the following",
    "we will find that , in spite of the smallness of the effect involved , a weak lensing analysis , carried out to second order , can provide interesting indications as to the possibility of detecting , in realistic cases , the presence of a double lens through its signature of an asymmetry in the jacobian matrix .",
    "simulations will show that such indications are further encouraged when the lenses involved are relatively strong .",
    "consider a large number @xmath51 of extended sources all subject to the _ same _ jacobian matrix @xmath52 for the relevant ray - tracing .",
    "in general , as noted above , @xmath53 .",
    "let @xmath54 be the measured quadrupole moments of the individual galaxies .",
    "these observed quantities are related to the source ( unlensed ) quadrupole moments @xmath55 by the equation ( see schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ; see also paper  i ) @xmath56 in the limit @xmath57 , the mean value of the source quadrupoles for an isotropic population of source galaxies should be proportional to the identity matrix @xmath58 with @xmath59 a positive constant .",
    "this is the starting point of the @xmath60-method described in paper  i and allows us to invert the relation for the mean values @xmath61 into @xmath62 note that the matrix @xmath63 is symmetric .",
    "here we have taken @xmath64 to be non - singular .",
    "the process of mass reconstruction makes use of the departures from the identity matrix of the ray tracing matrix as brought out by the observed quadrupoles . in practice ,",
    "the true jacobian matrix @xmath65 is considered to be unknown .",
    "equation   shows that if @xmath65 is a solution , any matrix @xmath66 obtained by multiplication by an orthogonal matrix ( so that @xmath67 ) is also a solution .",
    "thus in the determination of the shear associated with gravitational lensing the jacobian matrix is bound to be identified only up to an orthogonal matrix .",
    "it is easy to show that any solution @xmath52 for a problem for which @xmath65 is a solution can be written as @xmath68 , with @xmath69 a suitable orthogonal matrix .",
    "the same set of data @xmath70 can be analyzed by a standard single lens procedure , leading to the determination of a symmetric jacobian matrix @xmath71 , with the property @xmath72 .",
    "then @xmath71 is to be related to the true jacobian matrix @xmath65 by means of an orthogonal matrix .",
    "in fact , for a given @xmath65 , there are in general four different symmetric matrices available ( corresponding to matrices that differ by the sign of their eigenvalues ) .",
    "if we restrict the attention to transformations with positive determinant ( the @xmath73 ambiguity reflects the well - known @xmath74 invariance ; see schneider & seitz 1995 ) , we can write @xmath75 with @xmath76 here @xmath77 is the totally antisymmetric tensor of rank 2 and @xmath78 is the trace of @xmath65 ( we use the summation convention on repeated indices ) . note that the quantity @xmath79 is a measure of the asymmetry of @xmath65 .",
    "the symmetric matrix can thus be given in explicit form : @xmath80 with @xmath81    in what has been described so far , @xmath52 is considered to be the same for all the source galaxies .",
    "therefore at this stage we have addressed only the problem of a _ local _ analysis , applicable to source galaxies very close to each other , in a small patch of the sky , and at a similar redshift . in conclusion",
    ", we have so far shown that a local measurement can not lead to discovering a double lens , because there is always a way to interpret the data by means of a symmetric ray - tracing jacobian matrix .",
    "let us first consider only sources located at a given redshift @xmath39 . in the weak lensing limit ,",
    "the jacobian matrix for such sources is of the form @xmath82 , and the asymmetry is small , @xmath83 .",
    "thus we can write the related symmetric matrix ( the `` effective '' jacobian matrix ) as @xmath84 with ( see eq .  ) @xmath85 therefore the elements of the symmetric matrix ( appearing in the mass reconstruction analysis ) can be expressed in terms of those of the true jacobian matrix , as @xmath86 from inspection of eqs .",
    "and and from the definition of the _ true _ jacobian matrix , we find that the _ true _ source positions are related to @xmath87 and to @xmath88 by @xmath89 thus , if we refer to the vector field @xmath90 commonly used in weak lensing analyses , we find @xmath91 if we now combine the definition of @xmath90 with the above relations for @xmath87 and @xmath88 we get @xmath92 the last two equations replace the well - known relations applicable to single lens analyses , i.e.  @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "suppose now that the source galaxies follow a redshift distribution @xmath95 .",
    "at each redshift , we can apply eqs .",
    "( [ eq : b17][eq : b24 ] ) provided that all lensing quantities , such as @xmath65 , @xmath87 , @xmath96 , and @xmath88 , are calculated for each source at the correct redshift . in the weak lensing limit",
    ", the shear @xmath96 is estimated from the ellipticities of galaxies that are observed in a particular region of the sky .",
    "since source galaxies have different redshifts , in reality a mean value of the shear is measured : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the redshift - dependent shear . in the weak lensing limit",
    ", all quantities depend linearly on the shear , and thus eqs .   and can be written as @xmath99    unfortunately , these relations can not be used to infer directly , from a given set of data , the amount of asymmetry that would be a characteristic signature of multiple lensing .",
    "the reason is that for this purpose the data should be able to identify the vector field @xmath90 up to @xmath100 , because we know that @xmath101 . in practice , it is well - known that standard weak lensing analyses lead to the determination of @xmath90 only up to @xmath102 .",
    "in fact , observations lead to the determination of the _ reduced shear _ @xmath103 ; the identification of @xmath104 with @xmath96 is correct only to @xmath102 .",
    "thus the above analysis is not yet ready for practical applications .",
    "for this reason we need to extend the discussion so as to include the _ second order _ terms in the weak lensing expansion . in principle , the discussion can be carried out by retaining the redshift dependence of sources . in practice ,",
    "such approach would lead us far beyond the original purpose of this paper .",
    "for this reason we will suppose , in the following , that all sources are located at redshift @xmath3 ( in sect .",
    "5 we will consider again the spread of sources in redshift for the single lens case ) .    for a population of source galaxies located at a single redshift ( even in the case of strong lensing",
    "; but in this section , we recall , we are still within the weak lensing expansion ) an `` observable '' field is ( see kaiser 1995 ) @xmath105 for a strong single lens , such field has the important property that @xmath106 $ ] , with @xmath107 the dimensionless projected density that one aims at reconstructing . curiously , _ to second order _ in the weak lensing expansion ( see appendix  a ) , it is possible to show that , for multiple weak lenses of comparable strength , @xmath108 in other words , _ we have derived a set of equations for which the contribution of a small asymmetry present in the true jacobian matrix is retained consistently _ ; the structure is similar to that of the set for @xmath90 field presented in eqs .   and .",
    "_ the new set of eqs .   and is the basis that allows us to generalize the procedure to extract the available information , contained in the observed shear field , from the case of a single lens to that of a multiple lens and thus to investigate quantitatively the characteristics of the coupling of two or more deflectors located along the same line of sight_. the symmetric limit , which we may call in this context the single lens limit , is easily recognized .    the results of this section ( eqs .   and",
    ") are not generalized easily to the case of sources distributed according to a @xmath95 . however , the simulations described in sect .",
    "6.2 will basically support a description analogous to that given by eqs . and .",
    "the conclusions of this section , that the data contained in the _ shear map _ can be used to detect an asymmetry in the true jacobian matrix @xmath65 , and of the previous sect .  2.2 , that such a detection is impossible",
    "if based on a local measurement only , do not depend on the number of deflectors involved in a multiple lens . in the following",
    ", we will specialize our conclusions to the study of double lenses , for which the ray - tracing equation can be handled in a straightforward manner .",
    "in this section we formulate some questions that may be interesting from the astrophysical point of view . the expected size of some effects and the possibility of an actual measurement will be addressed in separate sections at the end of the paper",
    ".      the prime signature of double lensing would be the detection of a significant asymmetry @xmath88 ( see eq .  ) .",
    "because of statistical errors , the measured vector field @xmath109 is bound to be associated with a non - vanishing curl .",
    "therefore , a positive detection of asymmetry can be claimed only if the expected statistical error on @xmath88 is smaller than the true value @xmath110 characterizing the double lens .",
    "a quantitative analysis of this condition will be provided in sect .  5 below .",
    "here we only note that , in general , for two clusters of comparable strength , at different distances , with offset centers with respect to the line of sight , the regions on the sky where the signal - to - noise ratio for @xmath88 should be largest are those , on either side , just off the line connecting the cluster centers ( see fig .  [ fig : density2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dens_plot ] )    as we have seen in sect .  2",
    ", the asymmetry is expected to be weak ( @xmath111 for two clusters of comparable strength @xmath49 ) .",
    "the optimal conditions for detecting double lensing are then :    * the geometric parameter @xmath28 should be close to unity , i.e. , for a given distribution of sources , the distance between the two clusters should not be much smaller than the distance from the observer to the near cluster .",
    "this condition is reasonably satisfied if , for example , the redshifts of the two clusters are in the following relation , @xmath112 .",
    "* the two clusters should be not too weak .",
    "it is preferable to consider cases where the dimensionless densities , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , are of order unity . *",
    "the cluster centers should be offset , but there should be a region of significant overlap between the two clusters in the sky .",
    "given the above criteria , we now estimate the probability that a double lens with desired properties be observed . for the purpose",
    ", we refer to @xmath115 for the hubble constant , within a friedmann - lematre cosmological model characterized by @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "first , we suppose that a nearby cluster is observed at redshift @xmath118 ( the values of the various quantities used here are similar to the values used in the simulations to be described in sect .",
    "[ sect : simulations ] ) and ask what is the probability of finding a cluster at redshift @xmath119 well aligned with the first cluster ; in considering this question , we further require that the second cluster be sufficiently massive , with mass greater than @xmath120 . for the purpose , we assume that the angular distance between the centers of the two clusters be between @xmath11 and @xmath121 and that the redshift of the second cluster be in the range @xmath122 .",
    "a simple calculation then shows that the center of the second cluster must be inside a comoving volume with size @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , based on the cluster density found by borgani et al .",
    "( 1999 ; see also girardi et al .",
    "1998 ) , the expected probability of finding a `` good '' double lens turns out to be @xmath124 . if we consider less strict requirements , with an angular distance between the two cluster centers in the range @xmath10@xmath125 and a redshift range @xmath126@xmath127 for the second cluster , the estimated probability increases up to @xmath128 .",
    "these estimates should be combined with the number of massive clusters at small redshift ( for the object observed at @xmath129 ) that should be available over the whole sky .",
    "the comoving volume for a shell with redshift between @xmath130 and @xmath131 is @xmath132 ; correspondingly , the total number of clusters with mass above @xmath133 in such a volume is about @xmath134 . as a result , we expect from @xmath10 to @xmath135 cases of double lenses with detectable effects and configurations similar to the one considered in our simulations . from the way we have approached the problem , it is clear that the estimate just obtained provides only a _ lower limit _ with respect to the number of good cases expected for the purposes of the present paper .",
    "suppose that a set of data leads to the determination of @xmath136 and that , based on suitable boundary conditions ( e.g. , @xmath137 , @xmath138 for @xmath139 ) , we integrate eqs .   and and get the functions @xmath140 and @xmath141 . for a single lens problem the lensing analysis , at this stage , would be complete , since we would have the dimensionless projected mass distribution @xmath142 associated with the deflector ; knowledge of the critical density @xmath143 would lead to the projected mass distribution @xmath144 .",
    "in the case of a double lens , what would be the astrophysically interesting quantities that could be derived ?    for the following discussion , the ray - tracing equation can be re - cast in a more transparent form in the case @xmath145 ( so that @xmath146 ) .",
    "if we introduce the two _ curl - free lensing maps _ ( we recall that @xmath147 ) @xmath148 and the _ effective ray - tracing map _ @xmath149",
    "we see that eq .",
    "can be written as @xmath150 in other words , ray - tracing for a double lens can be seen as the composition of two curl - free functions .",
    "the double lens problem in its _ direct _ formulation involves two ( dimensionless ) ray - tracing functions ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , two critical densities ( @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) , and one additional geometric parameter @xmath28 .",
    "any inverse problem would be under - determined , if we start from the two dimensionless functions @xmath140 and @xmath141 alone . even if the geometry is taken to be known ( for example , when the distances to the two clusters acting as deflectors are known ) , it is not possible from the pair @xmath153 to `` reconstruct the two lenses , '' i.e.  to get the ray - tracing functions @xmath154 and @xmath155 separately .",
    "this statement is easy to understand , especially if we refer to the curl - free lensing maps @xmath156 and @xmath157 of sect .",
    "in fact , a simple scaling invariance @xmath158 , @xmath159 shows that , unless we are able to provide suitable boundary conditions on the functions @xmath160 ( e.g. , @xmath161 for large @xmath162 ) , there is no way to disentangle from the shear data alone the contributions of the two lenses .",
    "obviously , this does not mean that the lensing analysis is useless ; it is only a reminder that in this more complex situation an unambiguous mass reconstruction based on weak lensing would require additional input from other probes of mass distributions ( e.g. , x - ray data ) .    in order to clarify this point further",
    ", it may be instructive to consider the following simple examples , all characterized by @xmath163 .",
    "suppose that @xmath164 with @xmath165 a real continuous function such that @xmath166 .",
    "then it is natural to choose @xmath156 and @xmath157 to be radial , i.e. @xmath167 where @xmath168 and @xmath169 are real functions .",
    "supposing that @xmath170 for all @xmath171 , we can rewrite eq .",
    "as @xmath172 thus reduced to a one - dimensional problem , it is clear that this equation in general admits an infinite number of solutions .",
    "consider an effective ray - tracing map ( see eq .  )",
    "such that @xmath174 . in this case",
    "we can solve eq .   by choosing an invertible curl - free map @xmath157 and by writing @xmath175",
    "we now require that @xmath156 be curl - free . from the above equation",
    ", this happens if and only if the product of the jacobian matrix @xmath176 , associated with @xmath177 , and @xmath178 , associated with @xmath179 , is a symmetric matrix , i.e. @xmath180 from linear algebra we know that this is equivalent to saying that @xmath181 and @xmath178 have the same eigenvectors . since @xmath157 is curl - free ,",
    "let us introduce the potential @xmath182 so that @xmath183 and @xmath184 . if @xmath185 is a _ local _ system of coordinates where @xmath178 is diagonal , then eq",
    ".   is satisfied if @xmath186 is diagonal in the same system of coordinates , i.e.  if @xmath187 .",
    "this simply states that @xmath182 is _ separable _ in @xmath188 and @xmath189 , i.e.  that we can write @xmath182 as the sum of an arbitrary function of @xmath188 and of an arbitrary function of @xmath189 .",
    "this again demonstrates the freedom at our disposal in solving eq .  .",
    "in addition , one can now better appreciate why , even when natural boundary conditions are specified , in general there is no guarantee that the solution be determined uniquely ; in fact , several solutions are expected when the coordinate system @xmath190 is associated with _",
    "( such as the point @xmath191 for polar coordinates ) .",
    "one curious case that may be imagined is the possibility of combining two lenses with no net effect , so that @xmath192 ( see eq .  ) . in principle",
    ", one may argue that from any invertible curl - free map @xmath193 one can take a second lens characterized by @xmath194 .",
    "this idea would obviously generate an infinite number of solutions since the starting function @xmath156 is at our disposal .",
    "however , if we require that the density distributions associated with the two lenses be both _ positive definite _",
    ", i.e. that @xmath195 , it can be shown that there is no way for two lenses to exactly compensate for each other : in other words , the only admissible solution is the trivial @xmath196 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the theorem that states that any combination of gravitational lenses is bound to produce a net magnification ( @xmath197 ; see seitz & schneider 1992 ) .",
    "a different problem based on double lenses can be formulated in the following way .",
    "suppose that one observes a lensing cluster and that in the process of producing the mass reconstruction one finds evidence that the vector field @xmath109 is not curl - free , well above the expected errors .",
    "clearly , in such a situation , one possibility is that a separate mass concentration , which we may call a _ dark cluster _ , is responsible for the effect .",
    "we may now consider the case when the mass distribution of the visible cluster is well constrained by diagnostics independent of lensing ( e.g. , by x - ray data ) . under these circumstances , what can we tell about the dark cluster properties from the observed lensing effects ?",
    "in particular , is it possible to derive the location and the mass distribution of the invoked dark cluster ?",
    "if the mass distribution of the luminous cluster is taken to be known , one has either the function @xmath198 or the function @xmath199 , depending on whether the dark cluster is near or far ; in either case , the deflection associated with the dark cluster @xmath200 depends implicitly ( see eqs .  ",
    ") on the geometric parameter @xmath28 , which is unknown .",

    "in this section we calculate the expected order of magnitude for the measurable effects associated with double lensing . for simplicity",
    ", the following section discusses the noise properties of quantities related to the vector @xmath204 .",

    ", we may use a technique similar to that described in paper  ii .",
    "we first recall that in the reconstruction process eq .   is used together with a ( positive ) weight function @xmath208",
    ". such weight function , defined so that @xmath209 is significantly different from zero only for @xmath210 close to @xmath13 , enters in the local averages of quadrupoles ( or ellipticities ) . in particular , if we resort to the so - called q - method associated with eq .",
    "( see paper  i ) , the local average quadrupole @xmath211 is calculated from the relation @xmath212 here the superscripts @xmath213 label the galaxies affected by lensing . in paper  ii we have calculated expectation values and variances of several quantities , under the hypothesis that the weight function is invariant upon translation , so that @xmath214 , and that it is _ normalized _ , i.e. @xmath215 here @xmath216 is the density of galaxies ( taken to be constant over the field ) .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the expectation values of the relevant quantities ( in particular , the measured shear , the field @xmath204 , and the reconstructed mass density @xmath203 ) are equal to the true quantities _ smoothed _ by the weight function , e.g. @xmath217 from this expression it can be easily shown that the expected value for the measured curl of @xmath204 vanishes .",
    "in fact , @xmath218 here we have used the symmetry property of convolutions .",
    "thus , for a single lens , we expect to measure ( in the average ) a field @xmath204 with vanishing curl",
    ". note that , for a double lens , a similar calculation would show that @xmath219    let us now turn to covariances . using the same notation as in paper  iii",
    "( see also lombardi  2000 ) , we call @xmath220 the covariance of the ellipticity distribution for the population of source galaxies ( @xmath221 ) . there",
    "we have shown that the covariance of the shear @xmath96 is @xmath222 note that the covariance of @xmath96 , which we may write in short as @xmath223 , depends only on @xmath224 .",
    "then the covariance of @xmath204 is related to the covariance of @xmath96 in a simple way : @xmath225 similarly , it can be shown that @xmath226    the last expression is the basis of the following discussion .",
    "in fact , we may argue that a lens can be considered to be double only if the measured value of @xmath205 is significantly larger than the expected error on this quantity . if we refer to eqs .",
    ", as definitions of @xmath87 and @xmath88 , we thus find ( under optimal conditions defined in paper  ii ) @xmath227 a more useful expression can be found in the simple case of a gaussian weight function : @xmath228 in this case we have @xmath229}{64 \\pi \\rho \\sigma_w^{10 } } \\times { } \\nonumber \\\\    & { } \\times \\exp \\left ( - \\frac{\\| { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\delta$\\unboldmath } } \\|^2 } { 2 \\sigma^2_w }    \\right ) \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have called @xmath230 .",
    "note that @xmath205 shows anti - correlation for @xmath231 in the range @xmath232 .",
    "similar noise properties are associated with the quantity @xmath233 .",
    "now we are finally able to set a quantitative condition for the detection of double lensing .",
    "the requirement that the error on @xmath88 ( which can be estimated from eqs .   and ) be smaller than the expected value of @xmath88 , within factors of order unity , can be written as : @xmath234 note that @xmath235 represents the number of galaxies effectively used in the average of eq .  .",
    "if we refer to a case with @xmath236 and to the currently `` realistic '' density @xmath237 , with @xmath238 , we thus find that a significant signal requires the use of a gaussian weight function with smoothing size @xmath239 not smaller that @xmath240 . on the other hand ,",
    "the interesting effects are those associated with the structure of the field @xmath141 , which is associated with a length scale at best comparable with that of the clusters under investigation .",
    "therefore , we may argue that the most promising way to identify the effects of double lensing is to work with the smallest smoothing size @xmath239 compatible with condition . these arguments and the applicability of the condition defined by eq .",
    "are clarified and further supported by the simulations that will be presented in sect .",
    "so far , in this section , we have referred to a sheet of source galaxies at a given distance . in real situations where",
    "the source galaxies are distributed at different redshifts , we expect three separate effects that can have a significant impact on our analysis :    * an extra source of noise , related to the distribution in redshift of the individual sources , is added to our data . as a result , the measured shear will have a larger covariance than the one calculated in eq .  , and",
    "thus a larger covariance is also expected for @xmath205 . *",
    "an additional effect is induced by the extra - clumping of the sources described by the cosmological two - point correlation function ( see peebles 1980 ) .",

    "in fact , if we observe a single lens and just ignore the redshift distribution of the sources , we would naively start by identifying the observed average ellipticity with the reduced shear , using the relation @xmath301 .",
    "this mistake would lead in general to a quantity @xmath109 , defined by eq .  , with non vanishing curl .    for subcritical lenses seitz & schneider ( 1997 )",

    "correspondingly , the dimensionless density distribution obtained from the lens reconstruction changes by a factor @xmath304 .",

    "for example , for a nearly critical single lens at redshift @xmath307 the value of the relevant curl is about @xmath308 times smaller than the value associated with the double lens effect addressed in this paper .",
    "the nearly critical condition adopted in this example certainly overemphasizes the signal , with respect to the case of weaker lenses , and is unfavorable to the approximation suggested by seitz & schneider .",
    "still , if we apply the simple correction factor @xmath309 described above , we gain an extra factor of @xmath310 .",

    "the main goal of this section is to check the analytical framework developed in the paper and to provide convincing evidence that effects characteristic of double lensing are within reach of the observations .",

    "of course , since in this case the magnitude of the effect is very small ( the maximum value of @xmath88 is approximately @xmath350 ) , we should not expect that double lensing of this type could be actually detected .",
    "in passing we note that the order of magnitude for the various quantities shown in the figures is consistent with this value of @xmath88 .",
    "the tests for the strong case ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : divu - lapsigma2][fig : curlu - laptau_2 ] ) are rather surprising .",
    "in fact , fig .  [",
    "fig : divu - lapsigma2 ] shows that eq .",
    "holds approximately also in this case . however , eq .   turns out to be inadequate , as shown by fig .",
    "[ fig : curlu - laptau2 ] .",
    "this behavior reflects the fact that the lens configuration here has a rather high value of @xmath340 ( its maximum is about @xmath351 ) , and a small value of @xmath88 ( maximum about @xmath352 ) . a heuristic way to correct eq .",
    "is the following : @xmath353 the use of @xmath87 in the denominator of the previous equation is suggested by analogy with eq .  , where @xmath354 is used",
    ". moreover , we note that , to second order , eq .   is identical to eq .  .",
    "the new equation turns out to be a better approximation than eq .  , especially for regimes away from the strong and the weak limiting cases considered above ; in such intermediate cases eq",
    ".   performs better , typically by a factor of @xmath11 .",
    "finally , we have considered the problem of the dark cluster ( see sect .",
    "4.4 ) . in this case",
    "the simplified simulations in the semi - analytical approach described above have been performed with the aim of demonstrating how the redshift of a dark cluster can be determined when the redshift and the mass distribution of the luminous cluster are known . in order to find the unknown redshift we have minimized @xmath355 , the integral of the square of the left hand side of eq .   or of eq .  ,",
    "depending on whether the dark cluster is considered to be closer to us than the luminous cluster or not .",
    "simulations have been performed using the parameters of the strong lens configuration , by taking either the first or the second cluster as the dark cluster .",
    "figure  [ fig : findz-0.1 ] shows @xmath355 for the case where the dark cluster is in the front , while fig .",
    "[ fig : findz-0.4 ] shows the same quantity for the case where the dark cluster is behind .",
    "note that @xmath355 has a minimum ( near or equal to @xmath356 ) for the true redshift of the dark cluster .",
    "note also that the second minimum of @xmath355 occurs where the condition @xmath357 is met : in this case the quantities @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath179 all reduce to @xmath13 .",
    "we should stress that if a dark cluster is detected from a double lens signature , as described in this paper , and if the key characteristics of the bright cluster are known from independent diagnostics , then _ the reconstruction method developed here leads to the full determination of both the distance and the mass distribution of the invisible cluster_.      in order to ascertain the relevance of our analysis with respect to present and future observations , we have performed a set of simulations described in the following steps :    * we generate @xmath51 source galaxies .",
    "each galaxy is described by its location in the sky , its redshift , and its source ellipticity .",
    "locations are chosen following a uniform distribution on the observed locations @xmath13 ( thus neglecting the magnification effect ) .",
    "the redshift of source galaxies has been drawn from a gamma distribution used also by other authors ( e.g. , brainerd et al .  1996 ) @xmath358 \\ ; , \\ ] ] with @xmath359 ( other values of @xmath360 have also been tested ) . finally ,",
    "ellipticities @xmath361 are taken from a truncated gaussian distribution ( see eq .  ( 32 ) of paper iii ) characterized by @xmath362 .",
    "this value is probably unrealistically large ; it is adopted in order to test our framework under relatively unfavorable conditions .",
    "* as a model for the double lens we use the `` strong '' double lens model introduced in the previous subsection , within the same field of view of @xmath341 .",
    "* source ellipticities @xmath361 are transformed into observed ellipticities @xmath49 using the true asymmetric jacobian matrix associated with the lens .",
    "note that the redshift of each galaxy has been taken into account when performing this transformation . *",
    "the statistical lensing reconstruction procedure is applied to the observed ellipticities .",
    "the reduced shear map @xmath302 is derived by averaging observed ellipticities of nearby galaxies , from the relation @xmath305 properly corrected for the redshift distribution .",
    "* from the shear map we calculate the other relevant quantities : the vector field @xmath325 , its divergence , and its curl . * we then look for significant peaks in the curl map , which would reveal the double nature of the lens .",
    "several simulations have been performed with different source galaxy densities .",
    "the results obtained are very encouraging , since a significant signal in the the curl of @xmath109 is already detected with a galaxy density of @xmath363 .",
    "such relatively high density has already been reached by current observations .",
    "for example , new observations with the very large telescope of the cluster ms1008@xmath3641@xmath3651224 come close to it ( lombardi et al .",
    "2000 , athreya et al .  2000",
    "; see also hoekstra et al .",
    "2000 for observations of ms1054 with the hst ) .    figure  [ fig : dens_plot ] shows a typical result obtained in our simulations .",
    "the figure shows the density plot of the observed @xmath306 and , superimposed , the contour plot of @xmath366 , i.e.  the true quantity that we should measure in the limit of infinite galaxy density . for both plots",
    "we have used the same smoothing spatial weight function , a gaussian of width @xmath367 ( see sect .",
    "we thus conclude that , given the conditions adopted in our simulations , the characteristic signature of double lensing should be within reach of current observations .    finally , in order to test the reliability of the detection , we have performed analogous simulations using a single cluster . in this case , as explained above , we expect a ( nearly ) vanishing @xmath368 , especially after the correction for the spread of background sources is applied ( see sect .",
    "5.3.2 ) . figure  [ fig : density - single ] shows a map of this quantity ( with the correction applied ) in the case of a single lens at redshift @xmath369 ( the parameters of this lens are the same as those of the first lens considered in the double configuration ) .",
    "note that the noise observed is well below the signal shown in figure  [ fig : dens_plot ] .",
    "in this paper we have generalized the statistical analysis at the basis of mass reconstructions of weak gravitational lenses from the standard case of single lenses to the case of double lenses . from one point of view",
    ", this study leads to practical tools to deal with `` errors '' that might occur when the standard single lens analyses are applied to the not infrequent cases where two massive clusters happen to be partially aligned along the line of sight . in reality , our study of double lenses , based on the analytical framework mentioned in the first item below then checked and extended by means of simulations , has opened the way to a number of interesting results .",
    "this is a list of the main points made in our paper :    1 .",
    "a consistent analytical framework has been constructed where the contribution of the small asymmetry in the jacobian matrix induced by double lensing is retained to two orders in the weak lensing asymptotic expansion .",
    "2 .   given the known properties of the distribution of ( bright ) clusters of galaxies",
    ", we have shown that a few configurations are likely to be present in the sky , for which the small effects characteristic of double lensing may already be within detection limits .",
    "3 .   as a separate astrophysical application",
    ", we have demonstrated that , if the characteristic signature of double lensing appears in an observed configuration where a single bright cluster exists , with properties well constrained by independent diagnostics , the location and the mass distribution of the dark cluster , if present and responsible for the effect , can in principle be reconstructed unambiguously .",
    "we have checked that the redshift distribution of the source galaxies should not confuse the signature of double lensing .",
    "an examination of the relevant contributions to the noise of the shear measurements has brought up a limitation of weak lensing analyses related to the clustering of source galaxies . in particular",
    ", weak lensing studies of single clusters are found to be characterized by a lower limit for the expected noise , regardless of the depth of the images and of the density of source galaxies .",
    "a firm quantitative estimate of this surprising effect will be provided an a separate article .",
