    "in long - distance , classical communication networks , signals that are gradually distorted during their propagation through a channel are repeatedly recreated via a chain of intermediate stations along the transmission line .",
    "for instance , optical pulses traveling through a glass fiber and being subject to photon loss can be reamplified at each repeater station .",
    "such an amplification is impossible , when the signal carries quantum information .",
    "if a quantum bit is encoded into a single photon , its unknown quantum state can not be copied along the line @xcite ; the photon must travel the entire distance with an exponentially decreasing probability to reach the end of the channel .",
    "the solution to the problem of long - distance quantum communication is provided by the so - called quantum repeater @xcite . in this case , prior to the actual quantum - state communication , a supply of standard entangled states is generated and distributed among not too distant nodes of the channel . if sufficiently many of these imperfect entangled states are shared between the repeater stations , a combination of entanglement purification and entanglement swapping extends this shared entanglement over the entire channel . through entanglement swapping @xcite , the entanglement of neighboring pairs",
    "is connected , gradually increasing the distance of the shared entanglement .",
    "the entanglement purification @xcite enables one to distill ( through local operations ) a high - fidelity entangled pair from a larger number of low - fidelity entangled pairs , as they would emerge after a few rounds of entanglement swapping with imperfect entangled states , or even at the very beginning after the initial , imperfect entanglement generation and distribution .",
    "current implementations for quantum communication , in particular , quantum key distribution , are limited by a distance of about 200 km . in principle",
    ", one could go beyond this distance using a quantum repeater . however , the issue of actually realizing a quantum repeater protocol is rather subtle , even for not too long distances . in particular , the subroutines of entanglement distillation and swapping require advanced local quantum logic including , for instance , two - qubit entangling gates ; moreover , a sufficient quantum memory is needed such that local measurement results can be communicated between the repeater stations @xcite . nonetheless , various proposals exist , of which the most recent ones are based on the nonlocal generation of atomic ( spin ) entangled states , conditioned upon the detection of photons distributed between two neighboring repeater stations .",
    "the light , before traveling through the communication channel and being detected , is scattered from either individual atoms , for example , in form of solid - state single photon emitters @xcite , or from an atomic ensemble , i.e. a cloud of atoms in a gas @xcite . in these heralded schemes , typically , the fidelities of the initial entanglement generation are quite high , at the expense of rather small efficiencies .",
    "other complications include interferometric phase stabilization over large distances @xcite and the purification of atomic ensembles . yet some elements towards a realization of the protocol in ref .",
    "@xcite have been demonstrated already @xcite .",
    "further theoretical results were presented very recently @xcite , improving the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will extend our previous results on the so - called hybrid quantum repeater @xcite .",
    "this approach to long - distance quantum communication is somewhat different from those mentioned above .",
    "it relies on atom - light entanglement which becomes manifest in quantum correlations between a discrete spin variable and a continuous optical phase quadrature rather than a discrete single - photon occupation number .",
    "an optical pulse in a coherent state of about @xmath0 photons is subject to a controlled phase rotation ( achieved through dispersive , cqed - type interactions ) , conditioned upon the state of the atom . after propagating to the nearest neighboring repeater station and a further interaction with a second spin at that station",
    ", the light field is measured via homodyne detection and an imperfect entangled two - qubit state is nonlocally prepared between the two repeater stations through postselection .",
    "finally , the same dispersive light - matter interactions are exploited to achieve the local quantum gates ( `` qubus computation '' @xcite ) needed for entanglement purification and swapping .",
    "the two main advantages of the hybrid repeater protocol , distinct from the single - photon - based schemes , are the high success probabilities for postselection in the entanglement generation step and the intrinsic phase stabilization provided through reference pulses propagating in the same channel as the probes . however , these assets are at the expense of rather modest initial fidelities of the entangles states and high sensitivity to photon losses and noise in the optical channel .",
    "in fact , distances between repeater stations beyond 10 - 20 km turn out to be impossible with the current proposal ; the decoherence effect ( a damping of the off - diagonal terms of the two - qubit density matrix after postselection ) exponentially grows with distance such that only smaller mean photon numbers lead to a sufficient degree of entanglement ; however , the less intense coherent states are less distinguishable , hence resulting in a further decrease of fidelity through postselection errors .",
    "a good trade - off between these competing sources of errors is only possible for not too large distances .",
    "the analysis here will provide a possible solution to the distance limitation .",
    "this is particularly important , as the typical repeater spacing in existing classical communication networks is of the order of 50 - 100 km and thus incompatible with the current hybrid repeater protocol .",
    "the distance limit can be overcome by completely eliminating one source of errors , namely that which stems from the finite overlaps of the phase - rotated coherent states .",
    "this is achieved through a different detection scheme , where the coherent states are unambiguously discriminated .",
    "such an unambiguous state discrimination ( usd ) is error - free ; so for nonorthogonal states , it must include inconclusive measurement results",
    ". these will lead to lower efficiencies of the entanglement generation , in particular , when smaller photon numbers are used in order to suppress the decoherence effect through photon losses .",
    "the corresponding trade - off between success probability and fidelity means there are ultimate quantum mechanical bounds on the accessible regimes .",
    "we will discuss these bounds and propose suboptimal , but practical , linear optical implementations .",
    "the emphasis here is on possible measurement schemes for the initial entanglement generation .",
    "further , we investigate the hybrid entangled atom - light states before the measurements and potential variations of the entanglement distillation and swapping steps .",
    "the latter could be performed already on the atom - light level ( `` hybrid entanglement distillation and swapping '' ) rather than solely on the atomic level after the conditional state preparation .",
    "we do not consider issues related with the cqed part ( for this , see @xcite ) ; neither are we concerned about architecture - related issues on how to combine the entanglement purification and swapping steps in an optimal way ( for this , see @xcite ) .",
    "such considerations will be needed for comparing the overall efficiencies between the hybrid approach and the single - photon - based schemes .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",

    "further rounds of entanglement purification and swapping will eventually produce a high - fidelity entangled pair between the remote ends of the channel @xcite .    instead of using standard entanglement distillation and swapping procedures on the level of the qubits @xcite",
    ", we may also consider a purification of the imperfectly entangled , light - matter hybrid pairs , as described by eq .",
    "( [ qubitqubus ] ) . in this case ,",
    "local operations would partly act upon the qubits and partly on the light field ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "this potentially reduces the number of qubit resources and , moreover , only high - fidelity entanglement would be transferred from the light modes to the qubits .",
    "similarly , we could employ a hybrid version of entanglement swapping , where the bell - state measurements are performed on the light - matter hybrid systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "=    =      entanglement purification of optical , non - hybrid , entangled coherent states has been considered in ref .",
    "provided the initial copies of mixed entangled states are of a specific form ( rank two mixtures of a certain pair of entangled coherent , quasi - bell states ) , simple linear optics and photon detectors suffice to enhance the fidelity of the entangled states . however ,",
    "for realistic , dissipative environments , the decohered states would not end up in the desired form ; additional local hadamard - type gates ( transforming gaussian coherent states into non - gaussian superpositions of coherent states ) would be needed in order to accomplish the entanglement purification protocol .",
    "the situation turns out to be similar for the present hybrid protocol . as can be inferred from eq .",
    "( [ qubitqubus ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ qubitqubus2a]),([qubitqubus2b ] ) , the local hadamard gates in an entanglement purification scheme must act upon the qubit states of system `` a '' and the coherent - state superposition basis states of the qubus system `` b '' , eq .",
    "( [ qubitqubus3 ] ) .",
    "even though there are recent proposals to achieve such logical gates for coherent - state superpositions ( `` coherent - state quantum computing '' @xcite ) , using off - line prepared coherent - state superpositions , the need for extra non - gaussian , optical resources ( or , possibly , extra cqed - based , optical resources ) may be just as expensive as using additional cavity - based qubit resources .",
    "therefore we conclude that hybrid entanglement distillation does not appear to be a more practical alternative to the standard distillation procedures solely on the level of the two - qubit states .      in a hybrid version of entanglement swapping ,",
    "the bell - state measurements are performed on the light - matter hybrid systems ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . for this hybrid bell measurement",
    ", we can just use the same cqed interactions as for the initial entanglement distribution , described by eq .",
    "( [ interaction2 ] ) ; that interaction provides the entangling gate needed for a projection onto the hybrid `` bell basis '' .",
    "a subsequent hadamard gate can be applied to the qubit system before measuring both the qubit and the optical qubus in the `` computational basis '' .    more precisely , the following `` bell states '' are to be discriminated , @xmath94 in order to distinguish these states , an interaction gate similar to eq .",
    "( [ interaction2 ] ) is applied , where @xmath95 .",
    "the first pair of bell states in eq .",
    "( [ hybridbell ] ) is transformed into @xmath96 ; in this case , measuring in the hadamard - rotated qubit basis reveals the phase of the initial bell state . in order to additionally identify the second pair in eq .",
    "( [ hybridbell ] ) , which will be transformed into @xmath97 , apart from the qubit hadamard gate and qubit detection , a measurement on the optical qubus mode must discriminate the unrotated coherent state from the two rotated ones in phase space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .    for a nearly complete bell measurement ( approximately identifying any one of the four hybrid bell states ) ,",
    "the two rotated coherent states must not be distinguished by the measurement .",
    "this could be achieved via @xmath41 homodyne detection . however , as discussed previously , the distinguishability in phase space scales badly with distance along the @xmath41 axis .",
    "therefore , for a partial bell measurement identifying only half of the bell states , either @xmath42 homodyne detection can be used , or , alternatively , the usd - based scheme for unambiguously detecting the unrotated coherent state , as introduced in the preceding sections . in either case , @xmath42 homodyne or usd measurement , the efficiency of the bell measurement would be limited by @xmath56 .    now using the hybrid bell measurement for entanglement swapping ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) means projecting subsystems 2 ( the first qubus mode ) and 3 ( the second qubit ) of the initial pair of entangled qubit - qubus states , @xmath98 onto the bell basis in eq .",
    "( [ hybridbell ] ) . according to the method described in the preceding paragraph",
    ", the interaction between the qubit ( system 3 ) and the qubus ( system 2 ) leads to @xmath99 when the first qubus mode ( system 2 ) is unambiguously determined to be in the state @xmath100 , a hadamard gate on the second qubit ( system 3 ) plus measurement in the computational basis yields one of two possible hybrid bell states for the first qubit ( system 1 ) and the second qubus mode ( system 4 ) , with the phase depending on the measurement result . in order to obtain any one of the four hybrid bell states of eq .",
    "( [ hybridbell ] ) , in addition , the first qubus mode ( system 2 ) must be coherently projected onto the subspace corresponding to @xmath101 ( for example , via usd and photon - number resolving detectors ) .    in the above entanglement swapping scheme ,",
    "clearly the most practical choice is either @xmath42 homodyne measurement or usd measurement of the unrotated coherent state .",
    "a success probability below @xmath56 does not automatically render this scheme inferior to the conventional , deterministic entanglement swapping with the two - qubit entangled states , because in the latter case , first the entanglement needs to be distributed probabilistically with a success probability of at most @xmath56 using either @xmath42 homodyne or usd measurements .",
    "this probabilistic element is now simply incorporated into the hybrid entanglement swapping protocol . in other words , using the hybrid bell - state analysis , two initial entanglement distributions and subsequent qubit entanglement swapping can be done almost in one go ( when the final hybrid bell state is again converted into a two - qubit entangled state through another cqed interaction and selective measurements with probability @xmath56 ) .",
    "however , the bell - state analysis for the two - qubit entangled states in the conventional protocol relies upon complicated two - qubit quantum logic gates ; realizable , for instance , using another four cqed - based dispersive interactions @xcite .",
    "the hybrid bell - state analysis here would not require any extra dispersive interactions in addition to those for the initial entanglement distributions .",
    "however , a drawback is that we can not efficiently purify the hybrid entangled states ( as discussed in the preceding section ) in order to combine sequences of hybrid entanglement swapping steps with hybrid entanglement purification steps .",
    "in summary , we investigated the protocol for a hybrid quantum repeater , based upon dispersive light - matter interactions between electronic spins and bright coherent light , with respect to the different kinds of entangled states at the intermediate steps of the protocol and with regard to the final optical measurements for conditionally preparing two - qubit entangled states .",
    "as an alternative detection scheme , we propose to apply usd - based measurements on the optical qubus modes .",
    "compared to the homodyne - based scheme , there are various advantages of the usd - based protocol .",
    "first of all , one source of errors can be completely eliminated from the protocol , namely those errors arising from the inability of perfectly discriminating phase - rotated coherent states in phase space . in the usd scheme",
    ", this imperfection only leads to smaller efficiencies for the entanglement generation , but the fidelities are unaffected . as a result , the fidelities are solely degraded through the decoherence effect caused by photon losses in the communication channel . by choosing weaker coherent states ,",
    "the decoherence effect can be suppressed and , in principle , repeater spacings of far beyond 10 km are possible at the expense of smaller entanglement distribution rates .",
    "for example , initial fidelities of about 0.7 are achievable over 50 km and 100 km with success probabilities of about 1% and 0.01% , respectively , using simple on - off detectors ( discriminating between vacuum and non - vacuum states ) .",
    "the final two - qubit entangled states here , being , in principle , ideal rank two mixtures , can be purified very efficiently . for the usd - based protocol",
    ", we also derived ultimate , distance - dependent bounds on the performance of the entanglement generation step in terms of success probabilities and fidelities .",
    "finally , we examined the entanglement purification and swapping steps for the hybrid repeater protocol from a different perspective . instead of performing these steps solely on the level of the two - qubit entangled states , we considered purification and swapping with the hybrid entangled states of the atomic qubit and the optical qubus mode .",
    "it turns out that entanglement purification is difficult to achieve , unless optical , non - gaussian gates ( such as hadamard gates acting upon coherent - state superposition states ) are available .",
    "hybrid entanglement swapping , however , can be accomplished easily with exactly the same resources as used for the initial entanglement distribution .",
    "in fact , the probabilistic entanglement distribution steps can be incorporated into the hybrid entanglement swapping step , leading to the same overall efficiencies as for the deterministic , qubit entanglement swapping requiring complicated , less feasible quantum logic gates . however , a combination of hybrid entanglement swapping with hybrid entanglement purification in a nested repeater protocol would again require optical , non - gaussian gates .",
