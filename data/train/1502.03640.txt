    "the recent demands of non - equilibrium field theory applications in particle physics , cosmology and condensed matter have led to a renaissance in the development of novel field theory methods .",
    "the @xmath4-matrix school , rebooted in the guise of spinor - helicity methods , has led to a dramatic speedup in the computation of gauge theory scattering amplitudes in vacuum . on the finite temperature and density fronts , efficient functional methods in the form of @xmath2-particle irreducible effective actions ( @xmath2piea )",
    "have proven useful to understand collective behaviour and phase transitions @xcite .",
    "they are similar in spirit to methods based on schwinger - dyson equations in field theory or bbgky ( bogoliubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon ) equations in kinetic theory however , unlike the schwinger - dyson or bbgky equations , @xmath2piea naturally form closed systems of equations of motion without requiring any closure ansatz @xcite .",
    "@xmath2piea methods can be understood as a hybrid of variational and perturbative methods : @xmath2piea consist of a series of feynman diagrams , however the propagators and vertices of these diagrams are the _ exact _",
    "1- through @xmath2-point proper connected correlation functions which are determined self - consistently using variational equations of motion .",
    "this self - consistency effectively resums certain classes of perturbative feynman diagrams to infinite order . for example",
    ", the one loop 2piea diagram corresponding to the hartree - fock self - energy in @xmath5 theory actually sums all of the so - called daisy and super - daisy graphs of ordinary perturbation theory ( figure [ fig : hartree - superdaisies ] ) .",
    "this particular resummation is often done in the literature without the use of @xmath2piea , but such _ ad hoc _ resummation schemes run the risk of summing an asymptotic series : a mathematically dangerous operation ( recent progress on summability has been made in _ resurgence _ theory , which is beyond the scope of this work ) . @xmath2piea",
    "sidestep this issue because they are defined by the rigorous legendre transform procedure , guaranteeing equivalence with the original theory . unlike _ ad hoc _ resummations , @xmath2piea",
    "based approximation schemes are placed on a firm theoretical footing and can be systematically improved .    from left to right : the hartree - fock self - energy diagram , an example daisy or ring diagram , an example super - daisy graph .",
    "the whole class of super - daisy diagrams is obtained from iterating insertions of hartree - fock graphs in all possible ways . ]",
    "however , loop - wise truncations of @xmath2piea , @xmath6 , have difficulties in the treatment of theories with spontaneously broken continuous symmetries .",
    "the root cause of these difficulties is the fact that @xmath2piea obey different ward identities than the @xmath7piea . when the effective action is truncated to a finite order the equivalence between the ward identities is lost .",
    "this can also be understood in terms of the resummation of perturbative feynman diagrams : when an @xmath2piea is truncated some subset of perturbative diagrams are summed to infinite order , but the complementary subset is left out entirely .",
    "the pattern of resummations does not guarantee that the cancellations between perturbative diagrams needed to maintain the symmetry are kept . in the case of scalar field theories with @xmath8 breaking , the result is that the final @xmath9 symmetry is maintained , but , at the hartree - fock level of approximation , the nonlinearly realised @xmath10 is lost , the goldstone theorem is violated ( the @xmath11 goldstone bosons are massive ) , and the symmetry restoration phase transition is first order in contradiction with the second order transition expected on the basis of universality arguments .",
    "a similar problem arises in gauge theories , where the violation of gauge invariance in the @xmath12-loop truncation is due to the missing @xmath13-loop diagrams ( see , e.g. @xcite for a discussion of the gauge fixing problem ) .",
    "several studies have attempted to find a remedy for this problem .",
    "these are discussed in @xcite and references therein . here",
    "we restrict attention to the technique most frequently advocated in the literature .",
    "this technique constructs the so called _ external propagator _ as the second functional derivative of a resummed effective action which depends only on the mean field , obtained by eliminating the 2- through @xmath2-point correlation functions of the @xmath2piea by their equations of motion .",
    "the resulting effective action does obey a 1pi type ward identity and the external propagator yields massless goldstone bosons .",
    "however , the external propagator is not the propagator used in loop graphs , so the loop corrections still contain massive goldstone bosons leading to incorrect thresholds , decay rates and violations of unitarity . in order to avoid these problems",
    "a manifestly self - consistent scheme must be used .",
    "pilaftsis and teresi recently developed a method which circumvents these difficulties @xcite for the widely used 2piea ( also known as the cjt effective action after cornwall , jackiw and tomboulis @xcite , the luttinger - ward functional or @xmath14-derivable approximation depending on the context ) .",
    "the idea is incredibly simple : impose the desired ward identities directly on the free correlation functions .",
    "this is consistently implemented by using lagrange multipliers .",
    "the remarkable point is that the resulting equations of motion can be put into a form that completely eliminates the lagrange multiplier field .",
    "they achieve this by taking a limit in which the lagrange multiplier vanishes from all but one of the equations of motion , and this remaining equation of motion is replaced with the constraint to obtain a closed system .",
    "we show that this nontrivial aspect of the procedure generalizes to the 3piea .",
    "we find that the generalization requires a careful consideration of the variational procedure , however , and an infinity of schemes are possible .",
    "a new principle is required to choose between the schemes and we propose what we call the _",
    "dalembert formalism _ as the appropriate principle by analogy to the constrained variational problem in mechanics .",
    "we extend the work of pilaftsis and teresi to the 3piea for three reasons .",
    "first , the 3piea is known to be the required starting point to obtain a self - consistent non - equilibrium kinetic theory of gauge theories .",
    "the accurate calculation of transport coefficients and thermalization times in gauge theories requires the use of @xmath2piea with @xmath15 ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein for discussion ) .",
    "the fundamental reason for this is that the 3piea includes medium induced effects on the three - point vertex at leading order .",
    "the 2piea in gauge theory contains a dressed propagator but not a dressed vertex , leading not only to an inconsistency of the resulting kinetic equation but also to a spurious gauge dependence of the kind discussed previously .",
    "we consider this work to be a stepping stone towards a fully self - consistent , nonperturbative and manifestly gauge invariant treatment of out of equilibrium gauge theories .",
    "second , @xmath2piea allows one to accurately describe the initial value problem with 1- to @xmath2-point connected correlation functions in the initial state . for example",
    ", the widely used 2piea allows one to solve the initial value problem for initial states with a gaussian density matrix .",
    "however , the physical applications one has in mind typically start from a near thermal equilibrium state which is not well approximated by a gaussian density matrix .",
    "this leads to problems with renormalization , unphysical transient responses and thermalization to the wrong temperature @xcite .",
    "this is addressed in @xcite by the addition of an infinite set of nonlocal vertices which only have support at the initial time .",
    "going to @xmath16 allows one to better describe the initial state , thereby reducing the need for additional nonlocal vertices .",
    "lastly , the infinite hierarchy of @xmath2piea is the natural home for the widely used 2piea ( in all its guises ) and provides the clearest route for systematic improvements over existing treatments .",
    "thus investigating symmetry improvement of 3piea is a well motived next step in the development of non - perturbative qft .",
    "after this introductory section we review @xmath2piea in section [ sec : review - of - npi ] , focusing on the 3piea for a model @xmath17 scalar field theory with symmetry breaking as a specific example .",
    "then in section [ sec : symmetry - improvement ] we review and extend the symmetry improvement program of pilaftsis and teresi .",
    "this includes a derivation of the required ward identities , their implementation as constraints using lagrange multipliers and the limiting procedure required to obtain sensible equations of motion for the system .",
    "we will see that this procedure rests on a certain technical assumption which we will justify in appendix [ sub : the - dalembert - formalism ] and make a connection to the dalembert _ _ principle using a mechanical analogy .",
    "then in section [ sec : renormalization ] we investigate the renormalization of the theory , first with the two loop truncation and then three loops .",
    "the three loop truncation is analytically intractable in @xmath18 dimensions so , after discussing the renormalization procedure in arbitrary dimension , we present results for @xmath19 dimensions .",
    "the result of this section is a set of finite equations of motion which must be solved numerically . in section [ sec : hartree - approximation ]",
    "we solve the theory at the hartree - fock level and discuss the phase transition thermodynamics .",
    "section [ sub : two - dimensions - and ] is a verification that the coleman - mermin - wagner theorem holds in the symmetry improvement formalism despite the imposition of ward identities , a check on the consistency of the formalism . in section [ sec : optical - theorem - and ]",
    "we discuss the effects of symmetry improvement on the absorptive parts of propagators and make some comments involving the higgs decay rate and dispersion relations .",
    "finally in section [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the main themes of the paper and point out directions for future work .    on notation",
    ": we work mostly in 1 + 3 dimensions with @xmath20 , although the generalization to other dimensions is simple .",
    "we take @xmath21 as far as units are concerned , though we keep loop counting factors of @xmath22 explicit .",
    "repeated indices are summed .",
    "often , field indices accompany spacetime arguments . repeated indices in this case imply an integration over the corresponding spacetime argument as well ( `` dewitt notation '' ) .",
    "where explicitly indicated , spacetime and momentum integrals are written in compressed notation with @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 etc .",

    "the use of any other limiting procedure requires the analyst to specify a spacetime function s worth of data ahead of time , representing the `` work '' that the constraint forces do .",

    "<S> n - particle irreducible effective actions ( npiea ) are a powerful tool for extracting non - perturbative and non - equilibrium physics from quantum field theories . unfortunately , practical truncations of npiea can unphysically violate symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> pilaftsis and teresi ( pt ) addressed this by introducing a `` symmetry improvement '' scheme in the context of the 2piea for an @xmath0 scalar theory , ensuring that the goldstone boson is massless in the broken symmetry phase [ a. pilaftsis and d. teresi , nuclear physics b 874 , 2 ( 2013 ) , pp . 594619 . ] . </S>",
    "<S> we extend this idea by introducing a symmetry improved 3piea for @xmath1 theories , for which the basic variables are the one- , two- and three - point correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the imposition of a ward identity involving the three - point function . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the method leads to an infinity of physically distinct schemes , though a field theoretic analogue of dalembert s principle is used to single out a unique scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the standard equivalence hierarchy of npiea no longer holds with symmetry improvement and we investigate the difference between the symmetry improved 3piea and 2piea . </S>",
    "<S> we present renormalized equations of motion and counter - terms for two and three loop truncations of the effective action , though we leave their numerical solution to future work . </S>",
    "<S> we solve the hartree - fock approximation and find that our method achieves a middle ground between the unimproved 2piea and pt methods . </S>",
    "<S> the phase transition predicted by our method is weakly first order and the goldstone theorem is satisfied , while the pt method correctly predicts a second order phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the unimproved 2piea predicts a strong first order transition with large violations of the goldstone theorem . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that , in contrast to pt , the two loop truncation of the symmetry improved 3piea does not predict the correct higgs decay rate although the three loop truncation does , at least to leading order . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that symmetry improvement should not be applied to @xmath2piea truncated to @xmath3 loops . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that symmetry improvement schemes are compatible with the coleman - mermin - wagner theorem , giving a check on the consistency of the formalism . </S>"
