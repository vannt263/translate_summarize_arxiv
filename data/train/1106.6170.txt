    "with a preestablished reference frame between two remote users , alice and bob , the information of an arbitrary spatial direction @xmath0 can be conveniently encoded into a series of classical bits which allow them to exchange via quantum or classical channels .",
    "however , there are many cases when such a reference frame is not available and all what one can do is to send a natural object , such as gyroscope pointing in a direction , to share and align their reference frames@xcite .",
    "quantum spins-1/2 systems , polarized in direction @xmath0 , have been considered as a promising candidate for processing such unspeakableinformation@xcite . since the seminal work by peres and wootters@xcite , a considerable effort has been made in the literature to derive the optimal procedure in sending and receiving frame information@xcite . for a single spin ,",
    "the optimal encoding procedure is obvious and straightforward@xcite : alice simply uses a spin pointing into @xmath0 to encode the direction , and the optimal measurement method for bob is a standard stern - gerlach measurement , along an arbitrary direction @xmath1 .",
    "the measurement result @xmath2 provides a fidelity of @xmath3 which is the maximal accuracy with which bob can achieve from the quantum measurement . in ref.@xcite , gisin and popescu considered this transmission problem using two spins and discovered a surprising effect which is now often coined as nolocal without entanglement . in more details , to transmit the direction @xmath0",
    "using two spins , there may be two possible strategies .",
    "the first one is to encode @xmath0 in parallel spins @xmath4 , while the second one is quite similar to the first , except to polarize the second spin in the opposite direction , @xmath5 ( antiparallel ) .",
    "although in both cases the two spins are unentangled , it is shown that antiparallel quantum spin provides a definite improvement in the precision and efficiency in the transmission of frame information .",
    "recently , the best strategy for efficient use of @xmath6 quantum spins to align the reference frame have also been addressed @xcite .",
    "all these studies of reference frame transmission is centered around the improvement of the efficiency or the fidelity in our communication . in the real world , particularly in the presence of potential eavesdroppers ( eve ) , it is also of great importance to keep the security of the shared frame . in ref .",
    "@xcite , two quantum - cryptographic protocols ",
    "_ bb84-type _ protocol and _ ekert - type _ protocol have been proposed for secretly communicating a reference frame . however , up till now , a quantitative derivation of the security level ( bell inequalities ) above which the bb84-type ( ekert - type ) protocol is no longer secure has not been explicitly derived . in this paper , as a first step towards such a goal , we take the antiparallel quantum spins which provides the maximal transmission fidelity for two - qubit encoding as an example and consider the corresponding security bound .",
    "unintuitively , however , as we will show here , the antiparallel spins may not be the optimal protocol for transmitting the direction information , at least from the aspect of security . although antiparallel spins provides alice a convenient tool for improving her fidelity for frame transmission , they improve the fidelity for eve , too .",
    "this allows eve more freedom to eavesdrop .",
    "thus , a more theoretical and information theory - based analysis is required .",
    "our result is obtained by a careful derivation of the information disturbance tradeoff problem .",
    "in fact , the laws of quantum mechanics imposes a natural restriction on the information processing with the unknown quantum state .",
    "there is not a quantum measurement on the quantum system without introducing any disturbance .",
    "the more information one gains , the more the quantum state has to be disturbed .",
    "there exists a precise tradeoff between the information gain and state disturbance .",
    "more importantly , the tradeoff which is inherited by quantum mechanics is applicable to any measurement observer , including bob and eavesdropper , and imposes a general limit on the information eavesdropping in quantum communications@xcite .    in the following ( sec.[model ] ) , we will give a detailed description of the information - disturbance model for the security analysis of communication protocol with antiparallel spins .",
    "in sec.[bound ] we derive the optimal tradeoff bound by using group covariant and vector analysis technique .",
    "finally , an exemplary operation satisfying the tradeoff bound is constructed and sec.[conclu ] follows the conclusions .",
    "for convenience , let s present some basic notations that will be frequently utilized in the rest of the paper .",
    "firstly , we will identify the desired direction @xmath0 which alice wants to communicate with a group parameter @xmath7 .",
    "actually , with respect to a reference @xmath8 , there exists a rotation @xmath9 connecting the unit vector @xmath0 : @xmath10 .",
    "thus , we can rewrite the state @xmath11 denoting the unitary group representation for @xmath12 and @xmath13 the corresponding quantum spin state for direction @xmath14 @xcite . secondly , for what follows , we will also use the integral @xmath15 over the space of all possible pure state . for ease",
    ", we consider the invariant and normalized harr measure on @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath17 .",
    "we shall now pull back our attention to the communication scenario .",
    "suppose the unknown direction information is stored and transmitted with the antiparallel quantum state @xmath18(a ) )",
    ". however , in general , the quantum state received by bob is not always the original pure state , but a disturbed quantum mixed state @xmath19 .",
    "there are many reasons for the disturbance , some may come from the inevitable environmental noise and decoherence process , whereas , others may be attributed to eve s active attack . for security , we conservatively conjecture that eve has a full control of the environmental noise and all the decoherence is assumed to be due to eavesdropping . in fig .",
    "[ figscheme](b ) , we give a mathematical model for eve s eavesdropping process . without loss of generality , we here suppose eve performs a povm measurement to carry out his eavesdropping . this is the most general measurement in quantum mechanics and",
    "can be described with a collection of completely positive ( cp ) maps @xmath20 , where @xmath21 denotes the possible measurement results@xcite .",
    "moreover , choices of different map @xmath22 or of different number of distinct measurement results will constitute different kinds of povm measurement on condition that the map @xmath23 satisfies the trace - preserving condition .",
    "namely , there may be infinite many strategies for eve to choose to maximize his eavesdropping information . in the literature , many different definitions such as shannon entropy@xcite , discrimination probability @xcite and the quantum fidelity@xcite have been used to quantify the amount of eve s information . for ease , throughout the paper , we will use the fidelity between the state @xmath24 ( eve guessed from his measurement result @xmath21 ) and original state @xmath25 as a figure of merit for eve s information @xmath26 .",
    "after the measurement , the state will be extensively disturbed .",
    "the disturbed version , say @xmath27 , will be transmitted to bob for subsequent processing .",
    "the amount of the disturbance @xmath28 , characterized by the resemblance between the single qubit state and original state @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath29 $ ] , is what we mainly considered . here",
    ", @xmath30 denotes the identity in single - qubit hilbert space . in the following ,",
    "we will search for all kinds of povm measurements and derive the optimal information - disturbance tradeoff .    to give a precise meaning to our problem",
    ", we need to investigate some properties of quantum measurement .",
    "according to kraus s theory@xcite , each map @xmath22 can be written in the form of operator decomposition @xmath31 and will provide the state @xmath32 ( normalized ) after the result @xmath21 is observed , where , @xmath33 is the conditional probability of outcome @xmath21 occurring given that state @xmath34 is being input .",
    "the trace - preserving condition for maps @xmath22 further requires @xmath35 . for a completely unknown direction @xmath0",
    ", one can assume the corresponding group parameter @xmath9 is chosen randomly with the uniform probability distribution .",
    "thus , by averaging over all the possible measuring outcome @xmath21 and pure state @xmath25 , one can identify the average information and average disturbance for the povm @xmath36 as follows : @xmath37|\\langle \\psi_r|\\psi_g\\rangle|^2,\\label{g1}\\\\ \\mathcal{d}&=&1-\\mathcal{f}\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1- \\int_\\mathbb{g } dg \\sum_{r\\mu}\\mathrm{tr}[a_{r\\mu } \\widetilde{\\rho}(g ) a_{r\\mu}^{\\dagger } |\\psi(g)\\rangle\\langle \\psi(g)|\\otimes \\mathds{1}].\\label{f1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to be specific , we shall reuse the notation in eq .",
    "( [ vecn ] ) and assign a rotation @xmath38 for the guessed state @xmath24 . by rewriting @xmath39 , we can reduce the expression @xmath26 to @xmath40|\\langle 0|u_r^\\dagger u_g|0\\rangle|^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_\\omega dg^\\prime \\sum_{r\\mu}\\mathrm{tr}\\left[(u_r^{\\dagger}\\otimes u_r^{\\dagger})a_{r\\mu}^\\dagger a_{r\\mu}(u_r\\otimes u_r ) \\widetilde{\\rho}(g^\\prime)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times & \\langle \\psi_{g^\\prime}|0\\rangle\\langle 0|\\psi_{g^\\prime}\\rangle,\\label{g2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the second line we have defined @xmath41 and apply the invariance @xmath42 .",
    "generally , the value of information @xmath26 varies greatly depending on the intensity of eve s eavesdropping attack .",
    "however , two extreme cases have already been known : ( 1 ) the most informative measurement , with @xmath43 , happens when von neumann projection along the four tetrahedral directions is performed@xcite .",
    "( 2 ) @xmath44 regards to the case inwhich the projective measurement is performed within the hilbert space of @xmath45 only , leaving the first state @xmath25 intact , i.e. , @xmath46 @xcite . to escape from being detected",
    ", eve may adjust his strategy , varying his information from @xmath47 to @xmath48 . in this case , what is eve s minimal disturbance for each intermediate information @xmath49 is what we mainly focused and is in fact the mathematic description of the tradeoff problem .    for this purpose , one needs to perform an exhaustive examination of all the possible @xmath36 .",
    "fortunately , one can resort to the group covariant technique to strikingly simplify our problems .",
    "with the covariant map @xmath65 , the integral @xmath66 in eq.([g1 ] ) and ( [ f1 ] ) can be easily obtained . for @xmath28 , we have @xmath67\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1-\\sum_{i=0,1}\\int_\\mathbb{g } dg \\langle \\psi(g)|\\langle i|a_0 \\widetilde{\\rho}(g ) a_0^{\\dagger } |\\psi(g)\\rangle|i\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1- \\sum_{i , j , k=0,1}\\int_\\mathbb{g } dg \\langle \\psi(g)|\\left(|j\\rangle\\langle j|\\right)\\langle i|a_{0 } \\widetilde{\\rho}(g ) a_{0}^{\\dagger}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times|k\\rangle\\langle k|\\psi(g)\\rangle|i\\rangle \\nonumber\\\\ & = & 1-\\sum_{i , j , k=0,1}\\langle ji|a_{0}m_{jk}a_{0}^{\\dagger}|ki\\rangle,\\label{f2}\\end{aligned}\\]]where the operator @xmath68 can be calculated explicitly@xcite .    the derivation for @xmath26",
    "can be done in a similar way , which yields @xmath69|\\langle 0|u_h^\\dagger u_g|0\\rangle|^2 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_\\mathbb{g } dg\\mathrm{tr}\\left[a_{0}^\\dagger a_{0 } \\widetilde{\\rho}(g^\\prime)\\right]\\cdot\\langle \\psi(g)|0\\rangle\\langle 0|\\psi(g)\\rangle\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\mathrm{tr}\\left[a_{0}^\\dagger a_{0}m_{00}\\right].\\label{g2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now putting all these results together , the tradeoff problem can be formulated with the following semi - definite programming problem : @xmath70such that @xmath71 , a_0^\\dag a_0\\ge 0,\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\mathrm{tr}[a_{0}^{\\dagger}a_{0}\\mathcal{m}_1]=1~~ \\text{and } ~~\\mathrm{tr}[a_{0}^{\\dagger}a_{0}\\mathcal{m}_2]=3.\\end{aligned}\\]]due to the complication of the minimization above@xcite , an analytical solution to is not always obvious and available . however , in the rest , one will see that we can rely on the vector analysis technique and derive the optimal tradeoff bound . to continue our discussion ,",
    "we need to introduce a few vectors @xmath72 , @xmath73 such that @xmath74 this helps to give much simpler expressions to our problem .",
    "first of all , the trace - preserving equation ( [ trace ] ) can be reduced to @xmath75 with @xmath76 and @xmath9 defined by @xmath77    the optimization in eq .",
    "( [ optimization ] ) can now be equivalently reduced to looking for a set of vectors @xmath78 that satisfy the constraints eq.([vi ] ) ( [ v2376 ] ) and maximize @xmath76 for a given value @xmath9 .",
    "after some lengthy but not very interesting algebra , one can checked that the relation between @xmath76 and @xmath9 actually follows @xmath79 this means that for any quantum measurement , the amount of the disturbance @xmath28 caused on the quantum states must follows @xmath80    in the literature , the quantum measurement whose disturbance equals @xmath81 is named as minimal disturbance measurement ( mdm ) .",
    "this is the best strategy for eve , as it maximizes his information gain for a given average disturbance .",
    "the mdm quantum operation for antiparallel spins can be deduced from the derivation of eq.([fg ] ) . here",
    "we omit the complicated process and list the main result .",
    "in fact , the operators @xmath58 with @xmath82 is one example at hand . particularly , to see the interpolation between the two extreme cases mentioned in sec .",
    "ii , we can introduce a control parameter @xmath83 : @xmath84 . \\label{aoptimal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is straightforward to verify that , from equations ( [ f2 ] ) ( [ g2 ] ) , that the performance of the covariant measurement eq.([aoptimal ] ) follows @xmath85 and the equality sign in eq .",

    "inset plot : the monotonically increasing reduction in disturbance @xmath86 , with the information gain varying from @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "the reduction oscillates between @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and maximum @xmath91 is reached at @xmath92.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +",
    "before concluding this work , we have two problems to remark .",
    "the first one is the implementation of the covariant using only discrete povms . from the covariant operators above",
    ", we can construct an povm with only four outcomes .",
    "other operator can be obtained by @xmath93 , with @xmath94 : @xmath95 one can easily checked that all these operator satisfies the normalization condition @xmath96 and the optimal tradeoff for measuring antiparallel states follows eq.([ditradeoff ] ) .",
    "this indicates the relation in eq.([fg ] ) is exactly a tight one and can not be further improved any more .",
    "the second one is the physical meaning of the tradeoff bound in eq .",
    "( [ ditradeoff ] ) .",
    "we remark that it sheds some new lights on the secure transmission of reframe information .",
    "although the measurement leading to maximal information have already been proposed @xcite and even experimentally implemented@xcite , the state disturbance after their measurement is @xmath97 , which is not a minimal disturbance measurement for the antiparallel spins , as shown in this paper .",
    "this means that there exists a much better eavesdropping strategy for eve .",
    "for example , by choosing @xmath98 , it is not difficult to show that the minimum disturbance @xmath99 can be reached .",
    "this is far from a piece of good news for transmission information via the antiparallel spins . with the antiparallel state ,",
    "alice gains a definitely improvement in the precision or fidelity in her transmission of frame information to bob .",
    "but the precision or fidelity is improved for eve , too .",
    "what is worse , compared with the parallel quantum state , eve could obtain the same amount of information with a less disturbance . to see this , in fig .",
    "[ figg ] , we give a comparative plot of the information - disturbance tradeoff between the case of antiparallel spin and of the parallel spin . the tradeoff bound for parallel spins marked with dashing line is borrowed from ref.@xcite .",
    "it can be obviously observed that antiparallel spins provides an unexceptional improvement in the information gain ( @xmath26 up to @xmath100 ) .",
    "however , for the values @xmath101 a pronounced decrease in the disturbance will be spotted . in order to see the degree of decrease in a better way",
    ", we also plots the dependence of decrease @xmath102 on the information gain .",
    "numerical analysis reveals that the amount of reduction in @xmath28 increases monotonically with the gain , with the maximum @xmath103 attained at @xmath92 .    in conclusion",
    ", we give a heuristic security analysis of transmitting reference reframes , with the model of information - disturbance tradeoff .",
    "a strict bound for antiparallel spins , along with the optimal povm measurement which attains the bound is obtained .",
    "finally , we give a comparison between the tradeoff in antiparallel and parallel cases , which reveals that the improvement in information gain does nt always mean a good matter , at least in the cases when information is being measured with fidelities .",
    "we believe more thorough analysis using the information theory - based methods should be required .",
