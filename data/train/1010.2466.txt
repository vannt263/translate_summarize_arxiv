    "@xcite and is a better hypercube variant which is conceptually closer to the comparable hypercube @xmath1 than existing variants .",
    "the @xmath0-dimensional locally twisted cube @xmath2 is similar to @xmath0-dimensional hypercube @xmath1 in the sense that the nodes can be one - to - one labeled with 0 - 1 binary strings of length @xmath0 , so that the labels of any two adjacent nodes differ in at most two successive bits .",
    "one advantage is that the diameter of locally twisted cubes is only about half the diameter of hypercubes @xcite .",

    "ma and xu @xcite showed that for any two different nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 in @xmath2 ( @xmath6 ) , there exists a @xmath7-path of length @xmath8 with @xmath9 except for a shortest @xmath7-path , where @xmath10 is the length of a shortest path between @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in @xcite ,",
