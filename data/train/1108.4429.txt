    "many organizations rely on the skills of innovative individuals to create value .",
    "examples include academic institutions , government organizations , think tanks , and knowledge - based firms .",
    "workers in these organizations apply a variety of skills to in order to solve difficult problems : architects design buildings , biochemists develop new drugs , aeronautical engineers create bigger and better rockets , software developers create new applications , and industrial designers create better packaging materials .",
    "their success  and thus the success of the organizations they work for  is dependent on the particular set of skills that they have at their disposal , but in most cases , the decision of which skills to acquire is made by individuals , rather than organizations .",
    "the perception is that these workers choose to become more specialized as the problems they face become more complex ( strober ( 2006 ) ) .",
    "this perception has generated a countervailing tide of money and institutional attention focused on promoting interdisciplinary efforts .",
    "however , we have very little real understanding of what drives an individual s decision to specialize .",
    "roughly speaking , workers in knowledge - based fields can be divided into two categories : specialists , who have a deep knowledge of a single area , and generalists , who have knowledge in a wide variety of areas . in this paper ,",
    "i consider an individual s decision to be a specialist or a generalist , looking specifically at two previously unaddressed questions .",
    "first , under what conditions does it make sense for an individual to acquire skills in multiple areas ? and second , are the decisions made by individuals optimal from an organizational perspective ?",
    "most of the work done on specialists and generalists is focused on the roles the two play in the economy .",
    "collins ( 2001 ) suggests that specialists are more likely to found successful companies .",
    "lazear ( 2004 and 2005 ) , on the other hand , suggests that the successful entrepreneurs should be generalists  a theory supported by astebro and thompson ( 2011 ) , who show that entrepreneurs tend to have a wider range of experiences than wage workers .",
    "tetlock ( 1998 ) finds that generalists tend to be better forecasters than specialists .",
    "in contrast , a wide variety of medical studies ( see , for example , hillner et al ( 2000 ) and nallamothu et al ( 2006 ) ) , show that outcomes tend to be better when patients are seen by specialists , rather than general practitioners .",
    "however , none of this work considers the decision that individuals make with respect to being a specialist or generalist .",
    "while some people will always become generalists due to personal taste , the question remains : is it ever rational to do so in the absence of a preference for interdisciplinarity ? and is the decision that the individual makes optimal from a societal perspective ?",
    "there is evidence that being a generalist is costly .",
    "adamic et al ( 2010 ) show that in a wide variety of contexts , including academic research , patents , and contributions to wikipedia , the contributions of individuals with greater focus tend to have greater impact , indicating that there is a tradeoff between the number of fields an individual can master , and her depth of knowledge in each .",
    "this should not be surprising .",
    "each of us has a limited capacity for learning new things  by focusing on a narrow field of study , specialists are able to concentrate their efforts and maximize the use of that limited capacity , while generalists are forced to spread themselves more thinly in the pursuit of a wider range of knowledge . in the language of economics ,",
    "generalists pay a fixed cost for each new field of study they pursue , in the form of effort expended learning new jargon , establishing new social contacts in a field , and becoming familiar with new literatures .",
    "given that it is costly to diversify ones skills , the decision to become a generalist can be difficult to rationalize . in this paper ,",
    "i examine model in which workers decide whether to be specialists or generalists to explore conditions under which it is rational for an individual to choose to be a generalist .",
    "i show that when problems are single - dimensional and there are no barriers to working on problems in other disciplines , the equilibrium population contains only specialists .",
    "however , when there are barriers to working on problems in other fields ( eg : communication barriers or institutional barriers ) then there is a tradeoff between the depth of study of the specialist and the wide scope of problems that the generalist can work on . when problems are relatively simple , generalists dominate because their breadth of experience gives them a wider variety of problems to work on .",
    "but as problems become more difficult , depth wins out over scope , and workers tend to specialize .",
    "i then show that the equilibrium decisions reached by individuals are not necessarily socially optimal .",
    "as problems become harder , individual workers are more likely to specialize , but as a society , we would prefer that some individuals remain generalists .",
    "this disconnect reflects the fact that from a social perspective , we would prefer to have researchers apply the widest possible variety of skills to the problems we face , but individuals internalize the cost of obtaining those skills .",
    "thus , the model predicts that some populations will suffer from an undersupply of generalists . in such populations",
    ", it would be socially beneficial to subsidize the acquisition of skills in broad subject areas .",
    "finally , i consider an extension of the model in which problems have multiple parts .",
    "this allows me to consider problems that are explicitly multidisciplinary  that is , when different parts of a problem are best addressed using skills from different disciplines .",
    "i show when problems are multidisciplinary , it is possible to rationalize being a generalist , even when there are no disciplinary boundaries . in particular , when there is a large advantage to applying the best tool for the job , being a generalist is optimal .",
    "i construct a two period model . in period 1 , the workers face a distribution of problems and each worker chooses a set of skills . in period 2 ,",
    "a problem is drawn from the distribution , and the workers attempt to solve it using the skills they acquired in period 1 .",
    "i will solve for the equilibrium choice of skills in period 1 .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of all possible skills .",
    "the skills are arranged into 2 disciplines , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , each with @xmath3 skills , @xmath4 .",
    "an example with six skills arranged into two disciplines is shown in figure [ fig : two - disciplines ] .",
    "two disciplines , each with three skills . ]    a _ specialist _ is a person who chooses skills within a single discipline .",
    "a _ generalist _ is a person who chooses some skills from both disciplines .",
    "a problem , @xmath5 , is a task faced by the workers in the model .",
    "a _ skill _ is a piece of knowledge that can be applied to the problem in an attempt to solve it .",
    "each skill @xmath6 has either a high probability @xmath7 or a low probability @xmath8 of solving the problem .",
    "_ _ i will define a problem by the matrix of probabilities that each skill will solve the problem .",

    "define @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the mechanics of the model are as follows . in period 1",
    ", the workers , @xmath17 , each choose a set of skills @xmath18 . in period 2 , the workers attempt to solve a problem using those skills .",
    "i will assume that workers have a _ capacity _ for learning skills , which limits the number of skills they can obtain . in the current context , i will assume that all workers all have the same capacity for learning new skills , and that all skills are equally costly to obtain .",
    "let @xmath19 represent an individual s capacity for new skills and let @xmath20 be the cost of acquiring a new skill .",
    "i assume that workers pay a fixed cost , @xmath21 , for learning skills in a new discipline .",
    "that is , a worker pays @xmath22 to obtain the first skill in a discipline , and @xmath20 for every additional skill in that discipline . for simplicity",
    ", i will assume that @xmath23 .",
    "this assumption means that a specialist can obtain all @xmath3 skills in one discipline , and a generalist can obtain a total of @xmath24 skills spread over the two disciplines .",
    "although workers in period 1 do not know the particular problem they will face in period 2 , they do know the distribution , @xmath25 , from which those problems will be drawn .",
    "in particular , they know the probability that each skill will be an h skill or an l skill .",
    "for simplicity , i will make two assumptions about the distribution of problems : 1 ) skills are _ independent , _ meaning that the probability that skill @xmath26 is an h skill is independent of the probability that skill @xmath27 is an h skill and 2 ) skills are _ symmetric within disciplines _ , meaning that every skill in a discipline has an equal probability of being an @xmath28 skill .",
    "this knowledge of the distribution of problems can be translated into knowledge about individual skills .",

    "the vector of probabilities in the two disciplines , @xmath31 $ ] , is known _ ex ante . _",
    "workers choose their skills in period 1 to maximize their expected probability of solving the problem in period 2 .",
    "a nash equilibrium of this game is a choice of skill set for each worker in the population , @xmath32 such that no worker has an incentive to unilaterally change her skill set , given the distribution of problems .",
    "in this section , i consider two questions .",
    "the first question concerns individual decision - making  what is the equilibrium skill acquisition decision of the workers ? under what conditions do individuals decide to generalize ?",
    "the second question concerns the optimality of that population from an organizational perspective . is the equilibrium population optimal ?",
    "note that in order to simplify the exposition , i will consider a special case where all disciplines are equally useful in expectation  that is , where @xmath33 .",
    "it is straightforward to generalize the results to a case where @xmath34 ( see appendix for the details ) .      given that generalists pay a significant penalty for diversifying their skills , it is difficult to explain the existence of generalists in the population .",

    "thus no individual will ever be a generalist in two disciplines .",
    "( see appendix for the same result with @xmath34 )    note that this result generalizes to a case with more than two disciplines .",
    "generalists do worse as they add skills in additional disciplines , so this result holds regardless of the number of disciplines a generalist spreads himself across .",
    "theorem [ thm : if open no generalists ] clearly indicates that when workers can solve problems in other fields , there is no advantage to being a generalist .",
    "however , in practice , there may be many barriers between disciplines that prevent a worker in one discipline from solving problems in another .",
    "cultural or institutional barriers may prevent her from working on questions in other disciplines , either because resources are not forthcoming or because it is difficult to get compensated for work in other areas .",
    "communication barriers are also a significant impediment to interdisciplinary work ",
    "although a software engineers may have skills useful in solving user interface problems , field - specific jargon may make it difficult for her to communicate her insights .",
    "if communication barriers are severe enough , she may even have difficulty understanding what open questions exist .",
    "finally , a person in one field may simply be unaware of problems that exist in other fields , even if her skills would be useful in solving them .",
    "barriers to working on problems outside ones discipline give us the ability to talk about the `` scope '' of a worker s inquiry .",
    "generalists are able to work on a broader set of problems , and thus their scope is larger than that of specialists .",
    "there is therefore a tradeoff between the depth of skill gained through specialization and the scope gained through generalization .",
    "a specialist has a depth of skill that gives her a good chance of solving the limited set of problems in the area she specializes in .",
    "generalists have a limited number of skills , but are able to apply those skills to a much broader set of problems .",
    "thus , the choice between being a specialist and a generalist can be framed in terms of a tradeoff between the depth of one s skill set and scope of one s problem set .    more formally ,",
    "choice of whether to specialize will depend on two parameters .",
    "first , let @xmath43 be the expected probability that a skill wo nt be able to solve a problem drawn from @xmath25 .",
    "when @xmath44 is large , the probability that any one skill will solve the problem is very low .",

    "this range is illustrated in figure [ fig : generalists range ] .",
    "this diagram illustrates the tradeoff between depth and scope .",
    "when problems are easy to solve , scope is more valuable than depth .",
    "however , as @xmath44 increases and problems become more difficult , depth wins out over scope , and the range in which individuals choose to generalize shrinks .",
    "equilibrium skill acquisition decisions when @xmath46 and @xmath47 . ]",
    "theorem [ thm : communication barriers and generalists ] summarizes these results .",

    "the result follows immediately .",
    "( see appendix for the same result with @xmath34 )    note that the size of the regions in which workers specialize depends on how costly it is to diversify ones skills . as the fixed cost of learning something in a new discipline increases ( @xmath56 )",
