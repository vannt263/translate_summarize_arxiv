    "the fixed target experiment compass @xcite at cern sps is a two stage spectrometer dedicated to the investigation of perturbative and non - perturbative qcd .",
    "the comprehensive research programe comprises both physics with a muon and hadron beams , including the study of the nucleon spin structure and charm spectroscopy .",
    "identification of hadronic particles is required , and performed by rich-1 in the multi - decade gev / c range @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", a large size gas radiator rich has been in operation in compass since 2001 .",
    "multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpc ) with csi photocathodes have been used for the single photon detection , whereas the read - out was based on the gassiplex front - end ( fe ) chip @xcite .",
    "now , the central quarter of the 5.3m@xmath17 photon detection area has been fitted with a new detection system based on mapmt @xcite and is discussed in this paper .",
    "the outer regions stay unchanged , and are read out by a new system @xcite characterised by negligible dead - time and better time resolution .",
    "details on the compass data acquisition system may be found in @xcite .",
    "the memory time of about @xmath18s of the detection system and the dominant background due to uncorrelated muon beam particles in the central detector region had remarkably reduced the detector performance , especially for particles at the very forward direction .",
    "furthermore , the planned increase of the beam intensity from 40 to 100mhz , and trigger rates from 20khz in the past to 100khz , made upgrading the compass rich-1 mandatory in terms of a faster photon detection system .",
    "the new detector part consists of 576 mapmt ( hamamatsu r7600 - 03-m16 ) with 16 channels per pmt , each coupled to an individual fused silica telescope , see fig.[fig1.telescope ] .",
    "the purpose of the optics is to focus the cherenkov photons on the sensitive cathodes to gain a factor of approximately 7 in sensitive surface .",
    "moreover , the telescope has been designed to minimise image distortions , provide an angular acceptance of @xmath19 , and perform a spot size of @xmath201 mm ( r.m.s ) .",
    "the read - out is performed by 4 sensitive mad4 chips @xcite on 2 fe cards per mapmt , and high - resolution f1 tdc @xcite .",
    "one so - called dreisam card housing 8 f1-tdc reads 4 mapmt .",
    "both electronic cards are water - cooled via copper water line plates .",
    "one panel of mapmt fully equipped with fe electronics is shown in fig.[fig2.quarter ] . the mad4 chip features a small noise level ( 5 - 7fc compared to mean signals of 500fc ) and has a rate capability up to @xmath201mhz per channel .",
    "the new fe chip version cmad , that will be available for the 2007 run , will operate up to rates of 5 mhz per channel .",
    "the f1-tdc operate stably for input rates up to 10mhz per channel at 100khz trigger rates , and the time resolution of 120ps further ensures the background level from uncorrelated physics events to be negligible .",
    "the performance achieved in the past can be summarised as follows @xcite : photons per particle at saturation @xmath21 ( mean value ) , single photon and global resolution on the reconstructed cherenkov angle @xmath22 at saturation of @xmath23mrad and @xmath24mrad respectively , resulting in particle identification ( pid ) efficiency better than @xmath25 for @xmath26 , and 2@xmath27 pion - to - kaon separation at 43gev / c .",
    "one benefit of using mapmt is the extension in the wavelength range and the resultant increase of detected cherenkov photons as illustrated in fig.[fig3.yield ] .",
    "we expect an increase in the number of detected photons per ring by approximately a factor of 3 to @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "due to the improved time resolution of a few ns , we further expect a gain in the time resolution of single ring reconstruction to @xmath30mrad at @xmath29 .",
    "the improved @xmath31 leads to an extended pid capability towards @xmath32 and lower particle momenta , whereas the better @xmath33 extends pid to higher particle momenta , cf .",
    "fig.[fig4.pid ] .",
    "the effective space resolution of the system is about 5 mm , which leads to @xmath34mrad .",
    "finally , we expect 2@xmath27 pion - to - kaon separation at 50gev / c and efficient pid for small angles @xmath35 .    in fig.[fig5.coool_muon ] , the two dimensional hitmap of the @xmath36 channels or pixels are shown for one of the first compass 2006 sps physics runs .",
    "one clearly recognises the halo of the beam particles in the centre .",
    "first single event hadron rings detected with the compass rich mapmt are shown in fig.[fig6.coool_singleevt ] ( 10ns time cut applied ) .",
    "for the upgrade of the compass rich-1 , a fast photon detection system based on mapmt was designed and implemented on the time scale of one and a half years , and thus was ready for the compass 2006 data taking .",
    "the pid capabality will be extended to both - high particle momenta and near the threshold .",
    "first signals in the detector indicate the new system is working well , improving future compass physics results .",
