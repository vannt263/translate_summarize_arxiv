    "the standard model with a light higgs boson can be viewed as an effective theory valid to a much higher energy scale @xmath13 , possibly all the way to the planck scale . however , without protection by a symmetry , the higgs mass is quadratically sensitive to quantum corrections , rendering the theory with @xmath14 rather unnatural .",
    "little higgs models @xcite revive an old idea to keep the higgs boson naturally light .",
    "the key idea is to make the higgs particle a pseudo - goldstone boson of some broken global symmetry .",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking is then triggered by a coleman - weinberg @xcite potential , generated by integrating out heavy degrees of freedom .",
    "the higgs boson acquires a mass at the electroweak scale possibly by radiative corrections .",
    "the littlest higgs ( lh ) model @xcite is a minimal model of this type .",
    "it contains the minimal matter content necessary to accomplish the goal of canceling the higgs mass quadratic divergence to one loop order .",
    "it consists of an @xmath15 non - linear @xmath10-model which is broken down to @xmath16 by a vacuum condensate @xmath17 .",
    "the gauged subgroup @xmath18 ^ 2 $ ] is broken at the same time to its diagonal subgroup @xmath19 identified as the sm electroweak gauge group .",
    "a vector - like `` top quark '' is also needed .",
    "particles of the _ same _ spin cancel quadratic divergences among themselves .    due to the symmetry breaking by the vacuum condensate , the theory has a natural cutoff @xmath20 that is @xmath21 . the new heavy states , such as the new gauge bosons , heavy vector - like quark , and scalars all have masses of the order @xmath17 , naturally in the tev range .",
    "the effects due to the new states at low energies have been studied recently and generic constraints on the model parameters , in particular @xmath17 , are obtained @xcite based on the precision electroweak measurements .",
    "signatures for the new states at future colliders have also been examined @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the loop - induced decays @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the littlest higgs model .",
    "there are several motivations to perform this study .",
    "first , while the higgs boson is the central issue of the little higgs models , its properties have not been carefully studied to compare with the sm expectations . by construction ,",
    "the higgs boson interactions are necessarily extended and modified beyond the sm .",
    "second , although the new states in the lh model could be too heavy to be copiously produced at the lhc and quite possibly beyond the direct reach of a linear collider , quantum corrections due to these states running in the loops may reveal an earlier signature .",
    "third , these loop - induced decays depend primarily on the couplings of the higgs boson to the heavy quarks and gauge bosons , which are fixed and characteristic in the lh model .",
    "this is in contrast to the higgs boson couplings to the light fermions , which could in principle be generated by some higher - dimensional operators , leading to model dependent uncertainties .",
    "finally , both of these processes are finite at the one - loop order and therefore independent of the detailed physics at the cutoff scale @xmath13 , leading to robust predictions .",
    "it is well known that in the standard model , the contribution of a heavy sm particle to the loop amplitude for @xmath24 or @xmath25 approaches a nonzero constant value for particle masses much heavier than @xmath26 ( for example , this is a reasonably good approximation for the top quark loop @xcite ) .",
    "this `` non - decoupling '' behavior occurs because the masses of the sm particles are generated by their coupling to @xmath26 , so that the mass dependence of the coupling cancels the mass dependence of the loop integral .",
    "the heavy particles in the lh model , on the other hand , get their masses from the @xmath17 condensate , so that their couplings to @xmath26 are not proportional to their masses .",
    "thus the heavy particle contributions to @xmath24 and @xmath25 decouple as @xmath17 grows .",
    "we will show , in fact , that the deviation of these partial widths from their sm values scales with @xmath0 .    in the next section we lay out the masses and couplings of the particles in the lh model relevant to our calculation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hdecays ] we present our results for @xmath27 and @xmath25 , including their dependence on the additional free parameters in the lh model , and discuss the expected experimental sensitivity to these loop - induced couplings at future colliders . in sec .",
    "[ sec : disc ] we discuss the robustness of our results under extensions of the lh model and summarize our conclusions .",
    "finally , we present some details of the higgs sector necessary for our calculation in the appendix .",
    "any colored fermion that couples to the higgs boson significantly will contribute to the decay @xmath28 . similarly , any charged particle that couples to the higgs boson will contribute to @xmath29 .",
    "those states in the littlest higgs model include the heavy @xmath30 gauge boson @xmath31 , the vector - like quark @xmath32 , and the charged scalars @xmath33 . besides the common condensate @xmath17 as the most important scale parameter , the mass and couplings for each new state depend upon additional dimensionless parameters .",

    "the largest contributions will generically come from new gauge bosons , since their loop factor @xmath86 is the largest in the asymptotic limit .",
    "consider a single charged gauge boson with mass of order @xmath13 and coupling to @xmath26 of @xmath187 .",
    "its contribution to the amplitude will be smaller by a factor of @xmath188 than the contribution from @xmath115 , as can be estimated by an argument of explicit loop calculations or using the naive dimensional analysis  @xcite .",
    "as long as @xmath189 , the new physics at the scale @xmath13 will not significantly change our conclusions , unless there is a large multiplicity of new particles that couple to @xmath26 .    while the lh model that we have studied here contains only a single light higgs doublet ,",
    "many little higgs models in the literature contain two light higgs doublets  @xcite .",
    "the low - energy theory of these models is therefore a two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) , containing a light charged higgs boson @xmath190 that can run in the loop in addition to the new particles at the scale @xmath17 .",
    "assuming that the dimensionless higgs self - coupling @xmath191 in the 2hdm is of order one as is natural , a relatively light @xmath190 with a mass of @xmath192 gev can have quite a sizable effect on @xmath193 of @xmath194 times @xmath191 .",
    "for a heavier @xmath190 above 300 gev , the deviation is below 5% .",
    "potentially more important than the @xmath190 loop , however , is the effect of mixing between the neutral components of the two higgs doublets .",
    "this mixing can affect the couplings of @xmath26 to @xmath92 and @xmath91 in a very significant way if the second higgs doublet is relatively light , leading to large deviations in @xmath152 and @xmath5 . if the dimensionless higgs self - couplings are again of order one , the deviation of the @xmath195 coupling from its sm value due to 2hdm mixing is of order @xmath196 and that of the @xmath197 coupling is of order @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is the mass scale of the heavier higgs doublet ( more precisely , @xmath199 is the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath200 ) . for additional details ,",
    "see ref .",
    "these deviations are thus generically larger than the deviations due to the heavy states at the scale @xmath17 .    in conclusion ,",
    "our results are robust in little higgs models that contain only a single light higgs boson .",
    "the dominant contributions to the deviations of @xmath3 and @xmath5 from their sm values are due to ( i ) the new @xmath32 quark and @xmath115 bosons in the loop , which contribute at the order @xmath54 since they get their masses from the condensate @xmath17 ; and ( ii ) the modification of the @xmath201 and @xmath202 couplings due to mixing with the heavy states , which also contributes at order @xmath54 . any little higgs model must contain such a heavy @xmath32 and @xmath115 with masses of order @xmath17 to cancel the quadratic divergence of @xmath138 due to the top quark and @xmath92 , and these new heavy states will generically mix with the corresponding sm particles at order @xmath54 . therefore the gross features of our analysis should carry over .",
    "to summarize , we found that for @xmath2 tev , @xmath3 is reduced by @xmath4 in the lh model compared to its sm value , where the variation is mainly due to the dependence on @xmath40 , while @xmath5 is reduced by @xmath6 of its sm value , where the variation is mainly due to the dependence on @xmath40 and @xmath38 .",
    "the deviations scale with @xmath0 .",
    "a photon collider could probe the deviation in @xmath5 up to @xmath203 tev ( 1.1 tev , 0.7 tev ) at the @xmath151 ( @xmath204 , @xmath205 ) level .",
    "0.8 cm _ note added : _ when the current paper was being completed , another paper on a similar subject appeared @xcite . in calculating the higgs decay widths , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite did not take into account mixing and interference effects between the sm particles and the new heavy states , and thus reached negligibly small results of the order @xmath206 .",
    "the most general scalar potential invariant under the standard model gauge groups involving one doublet field @xmath209 and one triplet field @xmath210 can be written up to operators of dimension four as : @xmath211 the coefficients in this potential are constrained by the symmetries of the littlest higgs model . at tree - level , there is no higgs potential .",
    "a coleman - weinberg potential is generated after the heavy gauge bosons and vector - like quark are integrated out .",
    "the quadratically divergent terms of the one - loop coleman - weinberg potential each preserve one of two global @xmath212 symmetries , while breaking the other ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .    from the quadratically divergent part of the one - loop coleman - weinberg potential",

    "the coefficients @xmath216 and @xmath217 get no contribution from the quadratically divergent part of the one - loop coleman - weinberg potential because they are protected by _ both _ of the global @xmath212 symmetries of the lh model .",
    "thus they receive only log - divergent contributions at one - loop , and quadratically divergent contributions at the two - loop level .",
    "the suppression of @xmath216 from the extra loop factor gives the natural hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the cutoff scale @xmath13 . because @xmath217 is also generated at this order , it is not of order one like the other quartic couplings , but rather suppressed by @xmath218 and can be neglected for our purposes .",
    "the @xmath219 coupling is given by the following terms in the interaction lagrangian : @xmath220 where the dots represent terms that give subleading contributions .",
    "using the expressions for the couplings  @xcite , @xmath221 and the mixing angles between the gauge and mass eigenstates given in ref .",
