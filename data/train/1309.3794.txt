    "momentum distributions of nucleons and nucleon clusters in nuclei provide useful insights into various reactions on nuclei , such as @xmath17 and @xmath18 electrodisintegration processes or neutrino - nucleus interaction experiments .",
    "variational monte carlo ( vmc ) calculations of these distributions in @xmath19=3,4 nuclei were first reported in  @xcite .",
    "they were subsequently improved upon and extended to light @xmath20-shell nuclei , and also to the study of nucleon - pair momentum distributions  @xcite .",
    "many results of these studies have been supplied on request to various researchers , but not formally published before now .",
    "hence , in this paper , we detail their current status , provide figures illustrating the features of these momentum distributions , and announce a web site with detailed tabulations available for download  @xcite .    specifically , we present single - nucleon momentum distributions for @xmath19=212 nuclei , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23-cluster distributions for @xmath24 nuclei .",
    "we also provide a number of nucleon - pair momentum distributions as a function of either the relative pair momentum @xmath25 or the pair center - of - mass momentum @xmath26 .",
    "these are projected into spin @xmath27 or 1 and isospin @xmath28 or 1 combinations , or alternatively into @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 pairs .",
    "finally we provide more complete calculations of nucleon - pair distributions as a function of both @xmath25 and @xmath26 in @xmath19=3,4 nuclei than previously available .",
    "this work is complementary to a major recent study of nucleon momentum distributions by alvioli _",
    "et al . _",
    "they made _ ab initio _ calculations of the @xmath19=2,3,4 @xmath29-shell nuclei using a variety of realistic two - nucleon interactions , as well as more approximate calculations of the larger closed - shell nuclei @xmath30o and @xmath31ca , with an emphasis on the spin - isospin origin of the distributions .",
    "our work fills in the light @xmath20-shell nuclei up to @xmath32c , using primarily ( for reasons discussed below ) a realistic two- plus three - nucleon interaction .",
    "where our calculations overlap , we are in substantial quantitative agreement with their results .",
    "the vmc wave functions used in our calculations have been obtained for a realistic hamiltonian consisting of nonrelativistic nucleon kinetic energy , the argonne @xmath33 ( av18 ) two - nucleon ( @xmath34 )  @xcite , and urbana x ( ux ) three - nucleon ( @xmath35 ) interactions .",

    "@xcite ; it does not have the three - pion - ring or isospin - dependent short - range repulsive terms of il7 .",

    "this construction has been described in detail elsewhere  @xcite and the variational parameters in @xmath44 have been optimized by minimizing the variational energy expectation value , subject to the constraint of obtaining approximately correct charge radii .",
    "most of these wave functions have been used as starting trial functions for recent calculations of energies , electromagnetic moments and transitions , and spectroscopic overlaps using the more accurate green s function monte carlo ( gfmc ) method  @xcite .",

    "both positions are moved symmetrically away from @xmath59 , so eq .  ( [ eq : rhok ] ) becomes @xmath60 here the polar angle @xmath61 is also sampled by mc integration , with a randomly chosen direction for each particle in each mc configuration .",
    "this procedure is similar to that adopted in studies of the nucleon - pair momentum distribution  @xcite and has the advantage of very substantially reducing the statistical errors originating from the rapidly oscillating nature of the integrand for large values of @xmath45 .",

    "the dominant source of this tail in the 1.53 @xmath63 range is the @xmath34 tensor force , which comes from the pion - exchange potential , and is boosted @xmath16115% by the @xmath35 force with its two - pion - exchange terms .",

    "these different components have different behaviors as a function of @xmath25 which can again be traced back primarily to the pion - exchange tensor force , with the high - momentum tails largely dominated by the @xmath2 = ( 10 ) or @xmath147 pairs .",
    "the distributions @xmath170 as a function of total pair momentum @xmath26 also have a similar shape , but are noticeably flatter and seem to have less interesting structure .",
    "the @xmath181 are more complicated , particularly with the evolution of nodal structures as illustrated in fig.[fig : pphe4 ] .    while we have illustrated many of the above cases in the figures of this paper , the main results are to be found in our online figures and tabulations  @xcite .",
    "these include single - nucleon momentum distributions for 16 different nuclear ground states plus some excited states .",

    "nucleon - cluster distributions are given for 12 different cases .",
    "nucleon - pair momentum distributions include eight @xmath190 , seven @xmath165 , six @xmath171 , and six @xmath191 nuclear ground states , plus two dozen @xmath192 cases in @xmath182he .",

    "the most likely result from a gfmc evaluation is a further shift to higher momenta .",
    "first , the gfmc wave functions produce more binding which will decrease somewhat the population of nucleons at low momenta .",
    "second , gfmc wave functions generally have spin - isospin and tensor correlations that are enhanced relative to the vmc wave functions , which will raise the broad shoulder in the 2 to 7 @xmath63 region ; these correlations should also enhance polarization . the gfmc kinetic energy , i.e.",
    ", the second moment of the nucleon momentum distribution , is generally higher than the vmc kinetic energy by @xmath194 , also indicating a shift of nucleons to higher momenta , but still subject to the overall normalization remaining the same .",
