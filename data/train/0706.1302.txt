    "gro  j1655@xmath140 is a black hole x - ray binary whose parameters are well known .",
    "also called nova scorpii 1994 , the source was discovered with the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) on 1994 july 27 @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart was discovered soon after by @xcite ( @xmath3 mag ) .",
    "subsequent optical studies regarding the properties of the light curve during the outburst and quiescent period showed that the system is an lmxb composed of a blue subgiant ( spectral type f4 iv ) as the secondary and a black hole ( hereafter bh ) as the primary ( @xmath4@xmath5 , @xcite ) .",
    "the system is located at a distance of 3.2 kpc as measured by @xcite .",
    "although @xcite have recently suggested a smaller distance , their parameters imply that the donor star would not fill its roche lobe .",
    "@xcite established the orbital inclination of the system to be @xmath6 ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) ; an independent determination made by @xcite based on x - ray flux dips constrained the inclination of the system to be @xmath7",
    ". the inclination of the inner disk may be as high as @xmath8 , indicating a slight mis - alignment with the binary system @xcite .",
    "gro  j1655@xmath140 has displayed some of the most extreme behavior and phenomena yet observed from any black hole x - ray transient .",
    "@xcite discovered a pair of high - frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) at @xmath9 and @xmath10 hz in power spectra from the 1996/1997 outburst of the source .",
    "if the higher frequency is associated with the keplerian frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco , @xcite , located at @xmath11 for a schwarzschild black hole or at @xmath12 in the case of a maximal kerr bh of @xmath13 ; where @xmath14 is the gravitational radius and @xmath15 ; see @xcite and @xcite ) , the frequency observed indicates that gro  j1655@xmath140 harbors a spinning black hole .",
    "this suggestion is broadly consistent with spin estimates based on fits to skewed fe  k emission lines ( @xmath16 as per @xmath17 , @xcite ) .",
    "gro  j1655@xmath140 has also ejected extremely relativistic radio jets @xcite .",
    "finally , unbroken power - law emission ( i.e.  without a cutoff ) from gro  j1655@xmath140 has been detected out to 800kev @xcite , offering a crucial insight on high energy processes in black hole systems .",
    "high energy processes and the periods of correlated behavior known as `` states '' in black hole binaries are the focus of this paper .",
    "three active states are commonly recognized in the soft x - ray domain ( see @xcite ) : the non - thermal dominant or hard state ( formerly called low / hard ) , the thermal - dominant state ( formerly called high / soft ) , the steep power law state ( hereafter spl ) .",
    "additionally there are transitions between these states which are often referred to as intermediate states . in the hard state ,",
    "the soft x - ray emission is very weak and the spectrum is dominated by some kind of non - thermal emission that is broadly consistent with a power law ( hereafter pl ) at higher energies ( @xmath18kev ) .",
    "it has been known for a long time that black hole spectra in the hard state are exponentially cut off at @xmath19kev ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a radio jet is usually inferred in this state from flat radio spectra ( see @xcite for an unified model for x - ray states and radio emission in black hole x - ray transients ) . in the thermal - dominant state , the disk dominates the x - ray emission . although high energy emission ( @xmath18kev ) also is seen in this state , it is weaker , generally steeper , and extends up to 800kev without any break @xcite . in the spl ,",
    "these emission components are combined  both the disk and the non - thermal power - law are strong , although the disk no longer follows the @xmath20 relation that is observed in the soft state @xcite ; @xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the physical conditions of the innermost accretion flow and the nature of hard x - ray emission in the various states , but a clear picture has not yet been achieved . at low mass accretion rates hard x - ray emission may arise in an inner region filled by a hot ( @xmath21kev ) , radiatively inefficient , advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a recent study made by @xcite shows that the adaf scenario is not able to explain the relatively high luminosities that have been observed in the hard state of some black - hole x - ray binaries . alternatively",
    ", some recent models suggest that direct synchrotron emission , and/or synchrotron self - comptonization in a jet may dominate the hard x - ray emission ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "both at low and high mass accretion rates thermal comptonization in a corona ( fed by seed photons from the disk ) may also be an important source of hard x - ray emission ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative source of comptonization which is less reliant on the disk is bulk motion comptonizing ( bmc , @xcite ; see also @xcite for a co - moving comptonizing medium ) . in this case",
    ", the comptonization is due to bulk motion of an almost free falling ( convergent accretion ) flow close to the black hole .",
    "a thermal distribution of the comptonizing particles ( electrons ) necessarily leads to a turnover in the emitted spectrum around @xmath22 ; therefore , thermal comptonization should lead to a turnover near to the electron temperature of the corona , @xmath23 .",
    "synchrotron emission and non - thermal electron distribution do not necessarily predict such a turn - over , however , and this difference provides an observational tool to distinguish which processes dominate the hard x - ray emission in different black hole states .",
    "the high energy sensitivity of integral is especially well - suited to this purpose .    in this paper",
    ", we report on observations of gro  j1655@xmath140 made with integral during the outburst which began in february of 2005 @xcite . in section [ observ ]",
    "we describe our observations and in section [ curves ] we show the light curves obtained with jem - x , isgri , spi and omc ( instruments on - board integral ) and rxte and discuss the possible origin of their evolution . in section [ spectext ]",
    "we present our spectral analysis made with jem - x , isgri and spi .",
    "finally , in section [ discuss ] we discuss our results in the context of the different models and theories present in the literature .",
    "the data were obtained with integral and cover the first part of the 2005 outburst using the following instruments : the spectrometer on integral ( spi ; @xcite ) , the integral soft gamma - ray imager ( isgri ; @xcite ) , the joint european x - ray monitor ( jem - x ; @xcite and the optical monitoring camera ( omc ; @xcite ) .",
    "isgri is optimized for 15kev to 10 mev imaging and spi is optimized for high - resolution spectroscopy in the 18kev to 8 mev band .",
    "the former provides an angular resolution of @xmath24 full - width half maximum ( fwhm ) and an energy resolution , @xmath25 of @xmath26 ( fwhm ) at 100kev .",
    "spi provides an angular resolution of @xmath27 ( fwhm ) and an @xmath25 of @xmath28 fwhm at 1.3 mev .",
    "jem - x has a fully coded field of view ( fov ) of @xmath29 diameter and an angular resolution of @xmath30 fwhm .",
    "jem - x has medium resolution spectral capabilities in the energy range of 3 - 35kev .",
    "the omc is an optical monitor , with a fov of @xmath31 and an astrometric resolution of @xmath32 arcsec , and performs optical photometry in the v - band down to @xmath33 magnitude .",
    "our program consisted of 4 too observations of 100 ks each , spread from 27 february to 11 april of 2005 ( we will refer to these as epochs 14 below ; see table [ tobserv ] for more details ) .",
    "the difference in the exposure times between the integral instruments given in table [ tobserv ] ( jem - x , isgri and spi ) are due to the difference in the dead times and variation in the efficiency along the fields of view .",
    "the dithering pattern used during the observations was @xmath34 ( square of 25 pointings separated by 2.17 degrees centered on the main target of the observation ) ; this is the best pattern in order to minimize background effects for the spi and isgri instruments in crowded fields .",
    "data reduction ( in the case of jem - x , isgri and spi ) was performed using the standard off - line science analysis ( osa ) 5.1 software package available from the integral science data centre ( isdc ; @xcite ) . in the case of spi , because of the lower angular resolution and crowded field of view in @xmath35-rays at this position of the sky ( @xmath36,@xmath37)=(@xmath38,@xmath39 ) , ( see figure [ mosaic ] ) , we used a non - standard procedure in the analysis of the data , described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "for the same reason , in the case of omc , we used a standard pipeline available in osa 6.0 ( recently delivered ) for extraction of fluxes . for omc all the public data available from isdc",
    "were downloaded ( this resulted only in a slight increase in the ammount of data ) . because of the steep fall in response in the case of jem - x , and because of its reduced fov ( @xmath40 of diameter ) , we limited the pointing radius with respect to the gro  j1655@xmath140 position to be within @xmath41 . in the case of spi and isgri , with large fully coded fields of views ( fcfov ) ( @xmath42 for spi and @xmath43 for isgri ) , pointing selections were not necessary . in total ,",
    "199 individual pointing ( or science window  each having exposure times lasting from 1800 to 3600 s and following a @xmath34 dithering pattern on the plane of the sky @xcite ) data were used for both spi and isgri , 96 pointings for jem - x and 66 pointings for omc .",
    "gro  j1655@xmath140 was covered with integral as part of the galactic bulge monitoring program @xcite . precisely at the start of this program gro  j1655 -",
    "40 was reported to become active @xcite .",
    "the subsequent outburst of gro  j1655 - 40 was also followed with the rxte / asm and with a dense program of pointed rxte / pca observations ( homan 2005 ) . in figure",
    "[ lcurves ] we show the isgri ( 20 - 60 and 60 - 150kev ) , rxte / asm ( 2 - 12kev ) and omc ( optical ) light curves .",
    "the light curve derived from the ibis / isgri in the 20 - 60 and 60 - 150 kev energy bands had 1800 sec exposures ( about 150 counts / s correspond to 1 crab on - axis in the 20 - 60kev energy band , see appedix a in @xcite ) .",
    "gro j1655 - 40 was observed at a large off - axis angle ( @xmath44 from the center of the field of view ; so is in the partially coded field of view of ibis / isgri and not visible with x - ray monitor jem - x ) .",
    "since gro  j1655@xmath140 is located in a very crowded fov for the omc , in the flux extraction process we force the photometric aperture to be centered at the source coordinates , which are taken from the omc input catalogue @xcite .",
    "the typical limiting magnitude of the omc in the galactic bulge is between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this value depends strongly on sky background and source contamination . in our case ( @xmath36,@xmath37)=(@xmath38,@xmath39 ) we can confidently get limiting magnitudes down to @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) . for each integral pointing",
    ", the omc monitors the sources in its fov by means of shots of variable integration time .",
    "typical values in the range 10 to 200s ( currently 10 , 50 200s ) are used to optimize sensitivity and to minimize read - out noise and cosmic - ray effects . for the faintest objects ,",
    "several 200s exposures in the same pointing can be combined during data analysis on the ground .",
    "we obtained one photometric point by combining several 200s omc shots . to increase the signal to noise ratio , we combined the individual photometric points of every pointing and calculated the final photometric points by making running averages in order to minimize the dispersion .      for jem - x and isgri ,",
    "individual spectra were obtained for each pointing .",
    "the spectra were then combined to obtain an averaged spectrum per epoch using the @xmath48 osa tool and standard procedures ( see @xcite and @xcite ) to rebin the response matrices . in the case of spi",
    ", we derived directly one spectrum per revolution .",
    "the spi spectra were extracted over an energy range of ( 23 - 800)kev ( with 26 logarithmic bins ) using the spiros package within osa , applying maximum likelihood optimization statistics @xcite .",
    "due to the crowdedness of the field and the low spatial resolution of the instrument ( i.e. sources separated less than @xmath27 can not be resolved ) it was necessary to apply special techniques to extract spectra ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this included accounting for variability of the sources present in the fov .",
    "the background was determined by using flat fields from particular integral revolutions ( revolution 220 in our case  i.e. the time closest publicly available flat field to our period of observations ) , and the use of background method @xmath49 ( determination of the background based on some specific flat field integral observations ) . due to the fact that spi is a high resolution spectrograph in its energy range ( 20 - 8000kev ) with a reduced number of detectors ( namely , 19 ) it is not optimized in the detection of sources without taking into account previous information about the spatial distribution of them .",
    "thus , we used as an input catalog of sources those obtained from the isgri in the ( 20 - 40)kev mosaic images ( see figure [ mosaic ] ) .",
    "the signal from gro  j1655@xmath140 was too soft to detect any emission in the last two epochs with spi .",
    "we combined single revolution spi spectra from each epoch , since there was no significant evolution and in order to increase the signal to noise ratio .",
    "this resulted in one spi spectrum in revolution 290 and another one combining the revolutions 295 and 296 .",
    "the same was done for the low energy instruments ( jem - x and isgri ) , thus obtaining four spectra , namely one for each epoch , as can be seen in table [ tobserv ] .",
    "we applied 2@xmath50 systematic errors to the jem - x , isgri and spi spectra .",
    "we restricted our analysis in the energy ranges of @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53kev for the jem - x , isgri and spi spectral analysis , as recommended in @xcite .",
    "the spi and isgri spectra were rebinned at high energies ( @xmath54kev ) with the ftool @xmath55 procedure to reach the detection level of @xmath47 .",
    "figure [ lcurves ] shows the gro  j1655@xmath140 light curves obtained with isgri ( from the integral galactic bulge monitoring program ; @xcite ) in two energy bands ( 60 - 150kev and 20 - 60kev ) together with the omc ( optical ) .",
    "the public rxte / asm ( 2 - 12kev ) light curve in the same period of time is shown in the same figure for comparison .    the light curve in figure [ lcurves ]",
    "does only show the first month of outburst of gro  j1655@xmath140 . for a full outburst light curve , refer to @xcite .",
    "@xcite show the x - ray light curve obtained by swift , jointly with that obtained in the optical and ultraviolet band using the ultraviolet / optical telescope on - board swift ( uvot ) . in figure [ lcurves2 ]",
    "we show the rxte / pca light curve in the range ( 2 - 60)kev plus a hardness ratio ( calculated as the ratio of the 9.4 - 18.2kev and 2.8 - 5.7kev count rates ) evolution of the source during the entire outburst , taken from @xcite .",
    "the light curves were made from 520 rxte observations , with one ( averaged ) data point for each observation .",
    "the horizontal lines shown in figures [ lcurves ] and [ lcurves2 ] indicate the time intervals ( 100 ks each ; in 4 observations ) over which our average spectra were obtained .",
    "note that black hole transients usually begin and end their outbursts in the hard state ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and the 2005 outburst of gro  j165540 is no exception .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ lcurves ] , the beginning of the outburst first started at high energies ( @xmath56kev ) rather than at softer x - rays ( @xmath57kev ) .",
    "moreover , as can also be seen from the hardness ratios in figure [ lcurves2 ] , the observations of epoch 1 correspond to the hard state of black holes ( see section [ discuss ] ) . the other three epochs were done during a period when the source spectrum was much softer .",
    "however , it should be noted that it was only later in the outburst that the softest spectra ( corresponding to the thermal - dominant state ) were observed ( see figure [ lcurves2 ] ) .",
    "the first indications of an impending outburst of gro  j1655 - 40 came from rxte / pca bulge - scan observations on 2005 february 19 @xcite . on february 20 , observations made with the panic camera on the 6.5 m magellan - baade telescope at las campanas observatory revealed a j - band ( near - infrared ) magnitude of j=13.2@xmath580.1 @xcite , indicating that gro  j1655 - 40 was brighter by @xmath590.5 mag in j relative to its magnitude in quiescence ( j=13.7 - 14 ) @xcite . on the same date a radio detection of the source was reported @xcite .",
    "as can be seen from @xcite and @xcite the optical light curve behaves differently from the x - rays .",
    "the optical behaviour consists of an increase in the flux until a constant level at mjd=53455 .",
    "this behaviour can also be seen with the omc , because the flux in the optical light curve was increasing , reaching a constant and detectable value ( @xmath60 mag ) in mjd=53455 .",
    "then the optical flux became constant .",
    "it is also interesting to note the rapid increase of the radio emission at mjd@xmath5953450 , coinciding with our epoch 3 of observations and also with the beginning of the plateau in both the optical and infrared light curve .",
    "we performed fits to the combined jem - x , isgri and spi spectra , for each of the four epochs ( see table [ tobserv ] ) using xspec @xcite v.11.3 .",
    "all errors quoted in this work are 90% confidence errors , obtained by allowing all variable parameters to float during the error scan . in all fits",
    ", we fixed the value of the column density to @xmath61 atoms@xmath62 as obtained by @xcite using xmm - newton data of gro  j1655@xmath140 during the same outburst .",
    "our main aim in these fits is to characterize the broad continuum as seen with integral and its broad energy coverage . to account for uncertainties in relative instrument calibrations , we fixed jem - x multiplicative calibration constant to 1 and let that of isgri and spi free to vary in the fit for the different data sets as shown in table [ param_spec ] .    in figures",
    "[ fspec1 ] , [ fspec2 ] , [ fspec3 ] , [ fspec4 ] and [ fspec5 ] we show spectra from each epoch because these provide a convenient way to see the evolution of the source during our observations .",
    "we fitted the spectra with several models and the derived parameters are presented in table [ param_spec ] .",
    "we modelled the spectra with simple and phenomenological disk plus power - law models and common comptonization models described in section [ introd ] .",
    "we find that the former are very successful ( see section [ powerlaw ] ) , and there is no evidence for any spectral break in the data up to @xmath63kev ( see section [ compttmod ] ) .",
    "although a simple power - law provided marginally acceptable fits in the first two epochs , it was necessary to include an iron line and edges components in the fits of the last two epochs ( see section [ edges ] ) .",
    "we initially performed fits with a phenomenological power - law model ( @xmath64 model in xspec ) in the spectra that extend up to @xmath65kev .    in the first epoch ,",
    "the source spectra extend in the energy range of @xmath66kev for jem - x and @xmath52kev for both isgri and spi , respectively . in fitting with the @xmath67 model",
    ", we obtained a reduced chi - square of @xmath68 with @xmath69 ( @xmath70 meaning the number of the degrees of freedom of our fit ) .",
    "the presence of a multicolor disk component was not significantly required in our fit .",
    "the value obtained for the photon index was @xmath71 , common for black holes in a hard spectral state .    for the second epoch of our observations ,",
    "the source spectra extend in the energy range of @xmath51kev , @xmath72kev and @xmath73kev for jem - x , isgri and spi , respectively .",
    "this time the presence of emission coming from a disk was significant , and we added an absorbed multicolor disk component @xcite to the power - law ( @xmath74 model in xspec ) .",
    "we obtained @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the value obtained for the inner disk temperature was @xmath77kev .",
    "the spectrum is softer , with a value for the photon index of @xmath78 .    for the last two epochs , in fitting with a phenomenological power - law ( plus a multicolor disk black body component )",
    ", the spectra showed large negative residuals at @xmath79kev , compatible with the presence of @xmath80 edges .",
    "the presence of positive residuals in the range @xmath81kev is consistent with the presence of a broad @xmath80 emission line . in section [ edges ]",
    "we go into more detail on the fits of both these epochs .      as explained in section [ introd ] , all models involving thermal comptonization processes as the origin of the high energy emission seen in black hole transient systems predict",
    "an energy turn - over at the electron temperature of the corona .",
    "so , in order to assess the role of comptonization during the time of our observations , we fitted with the thermal comptonizing model of @xcite ( called @xmath82 in xspec ) , which deals with the special case of high temperatures and/or small opacities ( so the relativistic effects are taken into account ) .",
    "we also made fits using the bmc model of @xcite ( see also also @xcite for a co - moving comptonizing medium ) , which deals with the comptonization due to bulk motion of the almost free falling ( convergent accretion ) flow close to the black hole .",
    "moreover , we fitted with a phenomenological and multiplicative cutoff ( called @xmath83 in xspec ) model in order to find any turn - over energy in our data which could be in agreement with comptonization models playing the major role in the high energy emission of gro  j1655@xmath140 .",
    "we thus fitted the spectra of the first two epochs the presence of significant residuals compatible with broad @xmath80 emission line , edges and likely reflection could distort our undertanding of the continuum .",
    "thus , we do not use last two epochs in our study of the continuum models .",
    "moreover , the spectra in these epochs do not show significant emission at high ( @xmath84kev ) energies . ] with following models : @xmath85 ( hereafter called model 1 ) , and @xmath86 ( hereafter called model 2 ) and @xmath87 ( hereafter called model 3 ) . in the case of the first epoch ,",
    "the presence of a multicolor disk component was not significantly required in our fit .",
    "we assumed a spherical geometry for the comptonizing medium for the model 2 in all our fits .    for epoch 1 of our observations",
    ", we obtained the following statistics for all three models , i.e. @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) , respectively .",
    "we find that when fitting the data with a cut - off power - law ( model 1 ) , while showing slightly better statistics , the high energy cut - off can not be well constrained ( values between 5 and 54 kev are compatible with the data ) .",
    "the obtained folding energy is @xmath90kev .",
    "we made fits to separate jem - x+isgri and jem - x+spi to see if in one of the two data sets a break is possible . in the former",
    ", we obtained uncostrained values for the cut - off and the folding energies , being in the ranges of 5 - 38kev and @xmath91kev , respectively . in the second data set",
    "there was not any break in the data as well .",
    "we conclude that the cut - off features found are of instrumental origin and are not physically meaningful .",
    "thus , there is not any real cut - off in our data .",
    "this issue is also supported by the fact that the parameters optical depth and temperature of the electrons ( @xmath92 and @xmath23 ) when fitting with model 2 are unconstrained as well .",
    "this model clearly is not a good description of the high energy spectrum ( @xmath18kev ) .",
    "the model 3 , while giving the lowest residuals , does not allow to constrain the values for the parameters ( neither of @xmath93 and @xmath83 components ) .",
    "thus , this model does not represent a physical description of the data .",
    "the fact that model 3 provides slightly better statistics than the power - law model described in section [ powerlaw ] would be due to the fact that this model is a convolution of both soft and hard emission components taking into account the physical condition in the inner region of the accretion disk .",
    "we derive from fitting with all these models that high energies can not be reproduced by thermally upscattering photons by a comptonizing corona alone . in order to take this issue into account , we fitted the spectrum of this epoch with the hybrid comptonization model eqpair @xcite proper for very hot plasmas which describes the physics and emission properties of hybrid plasmas , where the particle distribution energy is approximately a maxwellian plus a power - law .",
    "this model deals a hot plasma cloud , mainly modeled as a spherical corona around the compact object , illuminated by soft thermal ( maxwellian ) and non - thermal ( either power - law or monoenergetic distributed ) electrons that lose energy by compton , coulomb and bremsstrahlung interactions .",
    "this model was shown to be successful in accounting for the high energy spectra of cygnus x-1 and other black hole candidates in different spectral states and over a broad energy band ranging from soft x - rays to gamma - rays ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ".    for epoch 2 of our observations , we obtained the following statistics for all three models , i.e. @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) , respectively .",
    "again , model 1 does not show a break or cut - off below @xmath96kev ( i.e. values of both cut - off and folding energies can not be costrained ) and model 3 is not a proper fit to the data due to the bad statistics . in this epoch , the values obtained for the optical depth of the comptonizing medium and the temperature of the electrons ( @xmath92 and @xmath23 ) can not be constrained .",
    "thus , the data show that thermal comptonization is not the main process that generates the emission at high energies ( @xmath18kev ) . as in epoch 1",
    ", we tested the model of @xcite , optimized for very hot coronae ( see description in paragraph above ) , this time coupled with @xmath97 component to describe the soft emission from the accretion disk .",
    "this model ( eqpair ) takes into account angle dependence , compton scattering ( up to multiple orders ) , photon pair production , pair anihilation , bremsstrahlung as well as reflection from a cold disk .",
    "as noticed by @xcite , if a spectrum extends up to @xmath96kev high energy emission coming from a non - thermal population of electrons is clearly present .",
    "as can be seen in figure [ fspecpo1 ] and [ fspecpo2 ] , in which we fitted both 1 and 2 epochs with a single power - law ( see description in section [ powerlaw ] ) , an small deficit of counts of the isgri spectra above 200kev with respect to spi is clearly present .",
    "moreover , the large bins of isgri spectra in this range of the spectra , would indicate that the source is not detected above 200kev .",
    "this is a comprehensive issue since spi instrument is optimized for doing spectroscopy up to 1mev while isgri has poorer sensitivity above 200kev .",
    "taking these considerations into account , we limited our analysis of isgri data in the energy range of @xmath98kev .",
    "the @xmath99 model allows to inject a non - thermal electron distribution with lorentz factors between @xmath100 and @xmath101 and a power - law spectral index @xmath102 .",
    "the cloud is illuminated by soft thermal photons emitted by an accretion disk .",
    "these photons serve as seed for compton scattering by both thermal and non - thermal electrons .",
    "the systems is characterized by the power ( i.e. luminosity ) @xmath103 supplied by its different components .",
    "we express each of them dimensionlessly as a compactness parameter , @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the characteristic dimension and @xmath106 the thompson cross - section of the plasma .",
    "thus , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 correspond to the power in soft disk entering the plasma , thermal electron heating , electron acceleration and the total power supplied to the plasma .",
    "the total number of electrons ( not including @xmath111 and @xmath112 pairs ) is determined by @xmath92 , the corresponding thompson optical depth , measured from the center to the surface of the scattering region .",
    "we considered the source to be moderately compact and fixed @xmath113 , as broadly reported for other sources with similar characteristics .",
    "the disk spectrum incident on the plasma is modelled with a multicolor disk blackbody as given by the @xmath97 model in xspec of @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the inner edge of the accretion disk was fixed to @xmath114kev .",
    "the limits of the accretion disk were fixed to @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "we attempted to fit both spectra of epochs 1 and 2 fixing the reflection covering factor to zero .    for epoch 1 of our observations",
    "we first performed a fit with non - thermal electrons injected with a power - law distribution of lorentz factors from @xmath117 to @xmath118 .",
    "the upper and the lower limits @xmath100 and @xmath101 were kept fixed while fitting the power - law index @xmath102 .",
    "this resulted in an acceptable fit with a reduced chi - square of @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "the unfolded broadband spectrum and residuals are shown in figure [ fspec1 ] .",
    "the best fit paramaters are presented in table [ param_spec ] .",
    "@xmath121 is about unity , i.e. intermediate between what is found in the hard state ( 4 - 10 ) and the thermal dominant state ( @xmath122 ) @xcite .",
    "the heating of the plasma is dominated by the non - thermal acceleration ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "we also fitted the spectra of this epoch considering a mono - energetically distributed population of non - thermal injected electrons instead .",
    "the obtained reduced chi - square is slightly better ( @xmath124 , @xmath120 ) .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath121 and @xmath125 remained unchanged , except for an increasing of the thompson scattering depth ( from @xmath126 to @xmath127 , for the former and the second fit , respectively ) .",
    "the increasing of the optical depth gives support to the scenario of comptonization through injected non - thermal electrons as being the dominant mechansim in the sense that if this is done by electrons with a mono - energetic distribution then a denser cloud would produce the same effect as taking into account a broader distribution ( both in energy and spatially ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that in order to reproduce the spectrum of first epoch , we have to consider an almost purely distribution of non - thermal accelerating particles .    as in epoch 1 , we tested the model of @xcite , optimized for very hot coronae in observations of epoch 2 , this time coupled with @xmath97 component to describe the soft emission from the accretion disk .",
    "we performed a fit with non - thermal electrons injected with a power - law distribution of lorentz factors from @xmath117 to @xmath118 .",
    "the upper and the lower limits @xmath100 and @xmath101 were kept fixed while fitting the power - law index @xmath102 .",

    "the best fit paramaters are presented in table [ param_spec ] .",
    "@xmath121 again is about unity .",
    "however , the heating of the plasma by non - thermal particles is practically zero ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "the situation does not improve by considering a mono - energetic distribution of the non - thermal accelerated electrons .",
    "this issue is not surprising , since , as claimed by @xcite , a very good spectrum extending above 200kev is mandatory in order to disentangle a likely population of non - thermal particles in the source . in the case of our observations ,",
    "the large bin at @xmath131kev shows that the source was not detected above this energies .",
    "we conclude that while in epoch 2 of our observations a break is not observable in the high energy data @xmath18 the energy coverage is not great enough in order to test the presence of non - thermal processes .",
    "this is due to the fact that in this period the spectrum became to be very soft , compared to epoch 1 , with radiation detected to @xmath131kev as maximum .        as shown in the shape of the residuals",
    "( see figure [ fspec3 ] ) , fits with simple multicolor disk model of @xcite and power - law did not give formally acceptable fits to the last two epochs .",
    "the presence of large residuals at @xmath81kev and around 10kev require us to take into account iron emission line , iron absorption edges and likely disk reflection components .",
    "these features are theoretically required in very ionized mediums as the close vicinity of the black holes ( see @xcite for a former detection of @xmath80 absorption lines and edges in gro  j1655@xmath140 in the context of observations of the 1996 outburst and @xcite and @xcite for a description of the @xmath80 line profile produced in accretion disks around black holes ) .",
    "the reflection component takes into account the physical condition of the compton - reflected continuum of a source of hard x - rays by an accretion disk @xcite .",
    "we fitted our spectra with the following model : @xmath132 and the results of the fits are shown in table [ param_spec ] . regarding the gaussian @xmath80 emission line component , we constrained the line center in the range of @xmath133kev , which is the allowed range due to the different ionization states of @xmath80 . also , we constrained the width ( @xmath134 ) of the iron emission line to be 1kev as a fiducial maximum value in order to get convergence of our fits . regarding the two iron absorption edges ,",
    "one was fixed at 9.278  kev , which corresponds to fe xxvi and is expected to appear given the likely range of temperatures and ionization .",
    "fitting this model to the spectra for epochs 3 and 4 , we obtained better results than fitting with a power - law model ( plus an absorbed multicolor disk ) , i.e. @xmath135 , with @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , with @xmath138 , for the third and fourth epoch , respectively .",
    "although the fit was unacceptable for the third epoch , because of the large residuals at around @xmath139kev , which could be due to reflection , kev removed bin in their study , made in order to improve the statistics for the joint spectrum obtained in this period . ]",
    "the fit was reasonable for fourth epoch .",
    "the multicolor disk component gave an inner disk temperatures of @xmath140kev for the fourth epoch , in which we also obtained a very soft photon index ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "we substituted the @xmath67 component by the @xmath142 reflection model in the third epoch .",
    "this component is a power - law with an exponential cut - off in order to take into account reflection effects in the spectrum . in fitting with the pexriv model",
    ", we imposed an overabundance of @xmath80 of 2.8 with respect to the solar value and @xmath143 , the last implying an inclination of @xmath144 for the inclination of the reflection medium , namely the disk ( as found by @xcite based on xmm and integral data for the same period of observations ) .",
    "the temperature of the disk that gave the smallest residuals was @xmath145k so we fixed this value in our fits .",
    "this value is consistent with having very ionized material in the accretion disk . also , in order to properly fit the high energy part of the spectra ( @xmath18kev ) it was necessary to fix the @xmath142 e - folding energy to a very high value , namely @xmath146kev , implying a non - detection of any cut - off up to @xmath131kev .    as a result of this fit for third epoch",
    ", we obtained a reflection covering factor of @xmath147 .",
    "actually , this value ( @xmath148 ) approximately measures the solid angle subtended by the reflecting medium as seen from the source of the primary radiation , @xmath149 , so that @xmath150 for an isotropic point source above an infinite optically thick slab .",
    "we fixed the ionization parameter to a very high value , consistent with a very high ionization medium , @xmath151=@xmath152erg@xmath153@xmath154s ( where @xmath155 is the 5 - 20kev irradiating flux and @xmath156 is the density of the reflector ; see @xcite ) .",
    "in order to estimate the source luminosity in each of our observations , we used the power - law plus an absorbed multicolor disk model for all the epochs .",
    "the contribution of the iron emission and absorption effects together contribute only by @xmath157 of our data in the last two epochs .",
    "the un - absorbed flux in the range of @xmath158kev energy range is @xmath159 erg@xmath160 s@xmath161 for the first to fourth epoch , respectively . for a distance of 3.2 kpc @xcite ,",
    "these fluxes give luminosities in the @xmath162kev energy range of @xmath163 erg@xmath164s .",
    "the un - absorbed fluxes in the 5 - 600 kev energy range are @xmath165 , @xmath166 ergs@xmath161 @xmath160 , giving luminosities of @xmath167 , @xmath168 erg@xmath164s for the first to fourth epochs , respectively . even if we take the broader energy range as more indicative of the true source luminosity , these values represent only 0.5% , 1.5% , 1.3% , and 1.3% of the eddington limit ( @xmath169 erg@xmath164s for a black hole of 7 @xmath5 ) , respectively .",
    "we have made fits to four epochs of integral broad - band spectra of the stellar - mass black hole gro j1655@xmath140 during its 2005 outburst .",
    "we find that gro  j1655@xmath140 was in the hard state in the first epoch , based on the low photon index ( i.e. @xmath170 ) and the absence of a strong thermal disk component .",
    "the source evolved to a state that resembles a thermal dominant state in the classification scheme of @xcite .",
    "these statements are in agreement with the previous study of this outburst by @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite , on the basis of their analysis of rxte / pca data of this source , showed that the luminosity of the accretion disk deviates from the the @xmath171 relation typical of thermal - dominant states during our other 3 observations ( epochs 2 , 3 and 4 ) .",
    "so , the state observed may not be a true thermal - dominant state , and/or non - thermal effects may need to be modeled to describe the accretion disk emission @xcite .",
    "for the two latest epochs , we found that our data is best fitted by adding an iron emission line and edges in the model consisting of an absorbed multicolor disk @xcite plus a power - law component . although the obtained fits were not formally acceptable ( @xmath172 for the third to fourth epochs , respectively ) , the fit in the fourth epoch was improved by @xmath173 . also , the shape of the residuals using the model consisting of a multicolor disk black body plus a power - law showed a clear excess in the @xmath81kev range and a drop at around 10kev , features that can only be explained by the presence of iron emission line and the presence of @xmath80 edges .",
    "the spectrum in the third epoch showed an excess of absorption in the @xmath174kev energy range with respect of that expected taking into account the edges obtained in @xcite based on xmm and integral spectra ( see section [ edges ] ) .",
    "this excess could be explained by the presence of reflection , but the situation is still unclear .",
    "we attempted to deal with this feature in third epoch by fitting with a broken power - law model ( @xmath142 in xspec ) but there is no clear evidence for a break in this spectrum .",
    "we conclude that for gro  j1655@xmath140 , it is difficult to study reflection features",
    ". this may be due to the high inclination of the source , which could alter the shape of the reflection features through scattering .",
    "the presence of these features in the spectra of epochs 3 and 4 may reveal differences in the disk outflow properties with respect to any outflow in epochs 1 and 2 .",
    "in fact , our spectrum obtained in epoch 3 precedes a _",
    "observation revealing a line - rich spectrum@xcite   by only 3 days .    assuming a value of @xmath144 @xcite for the inclination and a distance of 3.2kpc @xcite , the disk normalization factor ( in fits made only with a power - law model plus a multicolor absorbed disk )",
    "gives inner disk radii + where @xmath175 is in km and d is in units of 10kpc .",
    "this formula is inferred without taking into account gravitational effects from the general relativity theory . if gravitational corrections would be taken into account , then smaller co - moving radius would be obtained . ] of @xmath176 km for the second epoch ( the first epoch was in a hard state and had no significant contribution from the disk , as shown in section [ powerlaw ] ) . since @xmath177 km is the value of the gravitational radius for a @xmath178 black hole , we find that the matter arrives at inner radii of @xmath179 in the second epoch .",
    "this value is consistent with the value predicted for a maximally rotating black hole as explained in section [ introd ] ( @xmath180 ) and is similar to that obtained by @xcite . analyzing _",
    "data , @xcite found inner radii values of @xmath181 km , depending on the value adopted for the disk inclination .",
    "of course , values of the inner disk radius inferred from any continuum fits are suspect , and must be viewed with caution .",
    "a number of effects @xcite can serve to distort the observed inner disk parameters ( see @xcite for a determination of more realistic values for the radii , since these are not affected by a strong power - law component ) . according to @xcite ,",
    "the dominant effect seems to be that the opacity is dominated by electron scattering rather than free - free absorption .",
    "the net result is that the derived temperature given by the @xmath182 parameter overestimates the effective inner temperature by a factor of 1.7 or more @xcite .",
    "the most interesting issue regarding our integral observations of gro  j1655@xmath140 is undoubtely the presence of very significant and unbroken high energy emission up to @xmath96kev in the hard state of gro  j1655 - 40 , as noticed from first epoch .",
    "@xcite made a comparative measurement of a number of systems with cgro / osse and found that these systems showed a cut - off at high energies at around @xmath19kev in the hard state of many systems . since then several studies have tried to measure the cut - off in the spectra that could manifest the validity of comptonization processes by thermal electrons playing the major role in the high energy emission of black holes in the hard state . in our work",
    "we did not find such a break and the presence of a non - thermal population of relativistic electrons was infrerred from the fitting of our spectrum in the hard state .",
    "our finding is that non - thermal processes are the most important in order to explain the high energy emission of the hard state of gro  j1655 - 40 .",
    "additionally , there is not any break in the data indicating that the high energy emission is mainly produced by thermal comptonization as previously claimed . moreover , non - thermal comptonization is the main source of the high energy emission in the second epoch ( thermal dominant state ) .",
    "this condition for the thermal dominant state has been broadly reported in the literature since @xcite .    in table",
    "[ comp_previous ] we summarize a list of references showing breaks in the high energy emission of several black hole candidates in the hard and the intermediate state .",
    "one contemporaneous study by @xcite in the hard state of gro  j1655 - 40 used integral observations covering a period of time slightly prior to that of our first epoch .",
    "they pointed out the presence of a cut - off in their data at around 200kev in their isgri and spi spectra , as a manifestation of the role of thermal comptonization being the main source of the high energy emission .",
    "however , their sensitivity at energies @xmath54kev is not high enough in order to disentangle the energy emission of a non - thermal population of electrons . as also noticed by @xcite ,",
    "if a spectrum extends up to @xmath96kev high energy emission coming from a non - thermal population of electrons is clearly present .",
    "the finding of the contribution of the non - thermal population of electrons in the high energy emission was reported before for the cyg x-1 system ( @xcite , @xcite both in the intermediate state ) and may be for the grs  1915 + 105 ( @xcite , @xcite both in the thermal dominant state ) . with our study , we extend the list of sources showing high energy emission coming from non - thermal electrons with gro  j1655 - 40 , this time in the hard state . @xcite",
    "also reported the detection of a non - thermal population of electrons in the hard state of gx 339 - 4 .",
    "however , they indicated also the presence of a cut - off in the spectra .    in table [ comp_previous ]",
    "it can be seen that while some cut - offs appear to be close to the upper boundaries of the high energy instruments used , others appear to be physically meaningful .",
    "the last correspond to the systems gx 339 - 4 and cyg x-1 , both systems with known low inclination angle of @xmath183 and @xmath184 , respectively .",
    "gro  j1655 - 40 is a very high inclination system with an inner disk that could have an inclination of @xmath185 ( see section [ introd ] ) .",
    "comptonization processes of soft photons through thermal and/or non - thermal electrons seems to be highly isotropical from an observer external to the system , if the electrons do not acquire outflow velocities @xmath186 , @xcite , so in principle it would not depend on the inclination angle of the system .",
    "but other processes , like reflection , could depend on the view angle , being almost unobserved for high inclination systems like gro  j1655 -40 ( as pointed out above with our fitting of epoch 3 ) .",
    "so , gro  j1655 - 40 in the hard state would be an excellent source for the studying of comptonization processes , without the apparent disturbance of any other high energy mechanisms ( including soft emission from a disk ) .",
    "if these hypothesis are correct , we would have discovered that comptonization of black hole transients in the hard state occurs by mainly comptonization through non - thermal relativistic electrons .",
    "this conclusion is also supported by the studies of @xcite of cyg x-1 in the intermediate state because while showing a high energy cut - off at the energy around 100kev , they also point out to the presence of high energy emission from a non - thermal population of electrons in an state close to the hard ( in the case of @xcite in the hard state of gx 339 - 4 ) .",
