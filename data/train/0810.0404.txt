    "the main focus of interest at hera lies in the study of the structure of the proton , in detailed investigations of the various aspects of perturbative qcd and in searches for new phenomena .",
    "relevant in the context of this conference are the detailed studies of production processes and the differences therein between e.g. mesons , baryons and antiparticles . in addition , details about the non - perturbative aspects of fragmentation are investigated .",
    "search and studies of the production of excited and more `` exotic '' states in the @xmath1 environment , such as pentaquarks or glueballs constitute another part of the hera physics portfolio .",
    "overall , the hera @xmath1 results complement the findings of other experiments and help to build phenomenological models with strong predictive power , applicable at other machines .    at hera",
    "two different regimes in the photon momentum transfer squared @xmath2  are distinguished : _",
    "`` photoproduction '' _ denotes low @xmath3 @xmath4 , and _ `` deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) '' _ refers to high @xmath2   ( in practice @xmath5 ) . in the case of photoproduction , the additional variable @xmath6   describes the momentum fraction of the photon , that participates in the hard interaction .",
    "the total integrated luminosity available for physics at hera amounts to about 1 fb@xmath7 .",
    "the results presented below are based on fractions of this .",
    "* production cross sections of @xmath8-mesons and @xmath9-baryons * + the production of strange quarks can proceed perturbatively by the boson - gluon fusion process ( @xmath10 ) and by gluon splitting in parton showers . in addition , the proton parton densities and the non - perturbative string fragmentation can be sources of strange quarks .",

    "the various aspects of the production studied are : single differential cross sections of @xmath15 and @xmath9 , baryon - antibaryon asymmetry , baryon - to - meson ratio , ratio of strange - to - light hadrons , and the @xmath9 and @xmath19 transverse spin polarization .",

    "similar general conclusions can be drawn from the baryon - to - meson ratio distributions .",
    "for instance , the shape of the @xmath13 distribution in @xmath14 is not properly described by the pythia simulation in both cases .",

    "comparisons of the results with predictions of leading order monte carlo models matched to parton showers exhibit a picture , which is well consistent with the conclusions drawn from the @xmath30 production measurements . in summary ,",
    "a single strangeness suppression factor @xmath22 is not sufficient for a consistent description of all distributions in detail .",
    "this is partly due to the fact , that in various regions of phase space , the relative contributions of direct production of strange to other quarks differ ; in particular at larger scales ( e.g. @xmath2 , @xmath31 ) the charm contributions become substantial and need to be properly included into the description . + * bose einstein correlations of charged and neutral kaons * + bose - einstein correlations ( bec ) have been used in particle physics as a method of determining the size and the shape of a particle emitting source .",
    "bec originate from the symmetrization of the two - particle wave function of identical bosons and lead to an enhancement of boson pairs emitted with small relative momenta .",
    "the zeus collaboration reported  @xcite on studies of bec for pairs of identical kaons , both neutral and charged , in dis .",
    "zeus studied the two - particle correlation function @xmath32 as a function of the four - momentum difference of the kaon pairs , @xmath33 , assuming a gaussian shape for the particle source .",
    "the actual correlation function @xmath32 was calculated by means of a double ratio , comparing with a reference sample free from the bose - einstein effect .",
    "the measured distributions are shown in figure  [ fig : zeus - bec ] .",
    "the values of the radius of the production volume , _ r _ , and of the correlation strength , @xmath34 , were determined from these distributions .",
    "while the charged kaon data sample yields quite precise results , the neutral kaon data suffer from larger systematic errors due to background contributions from the @xmath35 decays .",
    "the radii for charged and neutral kaons are found to be in agreement within errors , similar to the ones measured in dis and are also seen to be consistent with those obtained at lep .",
    "a comparison of these results with other published values is shown in figure  [ fig : zeus - bec]c .",
    "the zeus collaboration has reported@xcite the observation of excited @xmath36 and @xmath37 mesons in the decay chains @xmath38 and @xmath39 . based on a sample of @xmath40 and @xmath41 and @xmath42 mesons ,",
    "the decays are studied in detail . from a total of 3110 @xmath43 , @xmath44 and 236 @xmath45 states ,",
    "properties like mass , widths and decay fractions are determined . in general",
    ", the measured properties agree well with the pdg values  @xcite , except the width of the @xmath43 state , which is found to be larger than the world average .",
    "the measured fragmentation fractions for these states @xmath46 in @xmath1 are found to be compatible with the ones observed in @xmath0 , supporting the universality of fragmentation .",
    "in addition , an helicity analysis of the angular distributions between the @xmath15 and the @xmath47 in the @xmath48 restframe for the @xmath45 yielded a helicity parameter of @xmath49 .",
    "this non - zero value of the helicity parameter @xmath50 suggests the state to be rather a mixture of two @xmath51 states , e.g. to contain contributions from both @xmath52- and @xmath36-waves , as @xmath53 is expected for a pure @xmath54-state .    a search for the radially excited state @xmath55 does not show a significant signal , and thus leads to the presently best upper limit on the charm branching fraction @xmath56 .",

    "such states could be interpreted as the @xmath60 ( @xmath52=@xmath61 , @xmath62 ) and the @xmath63 ( @xmath52=@xmath61 , @xmath64 ) members of the isospin @xmath65 quartet @xmath66 in the anti - decuplet  @xcite .",
    "the invariant @xmath67 mass spectra measured by the h1@xcite and zeus@xcite collaborations do not show any indication of a signal , apart from the well known @xmath68 baryon resonance .",
    "therefore the non - observation of any resonance state in the mass range @xmath69 in neither of the charge combinations limits the production rate of a hypothetical @xmath57 pentaquark to values of order @xmath70 on average at the @xmath71 c.l .",

    "the measured @xmath72 invariant mass distribution is shown in figure  [ ksks - glueball]b ) and clearly exhibits three prominent structures .",
