    "fluctuating condensed - matter systems enclosed by walls are characterised by the appearance of solvation force acting between the walls .",
    "this force originates from the fluctuations of the confined system .",
    "the properties of solvation forces have been the subject of increasing interest during the last years @xcite .",
    "both the shapes and possible chemical inhomogeneity of the confining walls influence the form of solvation forces @xcite which additionally depend on the thermodynamic state of the system and on the interaction between the system and the walls . in particular , if the system is chosen to be at its bulk critical point the solvation forces become long ranged and show universality @xcite while in the vicinity of criticality scaling behaviour is observed @xcite .    in this article",
    "we analyse the solvation forces in two - dimensional ising strips .",
    "the spins are confined by two parallel , planar and chemically homogeneous walls separated by distance @xmath2 .",
    "each wall interacts with the system by surface fields acting on the boundary spins .",
    "our goal is the exact determination of the properties of the solvation forces as functions of temperature , surface fields and the width of the strip @xmath2 . to investigate these properties we a use method based on exact diagonalization of the transfer matrix which",
    "is followed by numerical determination of appropriate eigenvalues .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in",
    "we define the 2d ising strip , recall its properties in the bulk limit as well as the properties of the semi - infinite system related to critical wetting . in we",
    "define pseudotransition temperatures and check that they display the scaling properties expected for higher dimensional systems .",
    "is devoted to our main goal , i.e. analysis of the properties of the solvation force acting between the system boundaries .",
    "we first recall the definition of solvation force and adapt it to our model .",
    "we study this force numerically to establish several of its properties as functions of temperature , surface fields and the distance between the walls . for large width of the strip we explain these properties by introducing scaling functions in three different scaling regimes : around the wetting temperature , around the bulk critical temperature , and in regime in which both of the above temperatures are close to each other .",
    "we consider an ising model on a two - dimensional square lattice with @xmath3 columns and @xmath2 rows , and impose periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction . in this way",
    "the ising strip of width @xmath2 is obtained .",
    "we assume that surface fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 act on the spins located at the bottom and the top row , respectively ; these fields can be considered as model short range interactions between the system and the surrounding walls .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system has the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the spin located in the @xmath8-th column and @xmath9-th row , and @xmath10 .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath11 is positive ( ferromagnetic case ) and we assume no bulk field @xmath12 acting on the system .    in this paper , we concentrate on two special choices of surface fields corresponding to the so - called symmetric and antisymmetric case : in the symmetric case ( denoted by the superscript s ) one has @xmath13 while in the antisymmetric case ( as ) @xmath14 . later on , we will also use superscript o to denote the limiting case @xmath15 which is referred to as the free case .      to calculate the free energy of our system we use the method based on exact diagonalization of the transfer matrix . in this method the @xmath16 transfer matrix is represented by @xmath17 orthogonal matrix @xmath18 .",
    "eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are calculated from eigenvalues of @xmath18 which can be found by solving recurrence equations for eigenvectors of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "here we only recall the final formulae for the free energy per column ( here and in the following formulae we do not explicitly write the dependence of the free energy and other quantities on the coupling constant @xmath11 ) @xmath19,\\label{free : e1}\\\\ \\fl\\bar{f}^\\mathrm{as}\\left(t , h_1,m\\right)&=&-{k_\\mathrm{b}}t\\left [ \\frac{1}{2}\\left ( -\\gamma_1+\\gamma_2+\\gamma_3+\\ldots      + \\gamma_{m+1}\\right)+\\frac{m}{2 } \\ln\\left ( 2\\sinh 2k \\right)\\right],\\label{free : e2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the coefficients @xmath22 are positive functions of parameters @xmath23 and @xmath2 defined by relation @xmath24 where parameter @xmath25 is obtained from @xmath26 .",
    "the functions @xmath27 are solutions of the equations @xmath28 and @xmath29 . the function @xmath30 is defined as @xmath31 the symbol @xmath32 denotes the bulk critical temperature @xcite @xmath33 while @xmath34 denotes the temperature of the critical wetting transition taking place in the semi - infinite ising model .",
    "it depends on the surface field @xmath4 and can be defined by equation @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 we observe that for certain ranges of temperatures may not have a solution for @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in such cases @xmath39 and @xmath40 are imaginary and satisfy equations @xmath41\\right\\ } , \\qquad k=1,2,\\ ] ] with @xmath42 .",
    "the detailed rules for selecting the signs of @xmath43 and @xmath44 are presented in the next subsection .",
    "functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 are calculated from the formulae @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and the function @xmath50 is given in . to determine the angles @xmath51 and",
    "@xmath52 uniquely we pick the continuous branches of solutions for which @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 , the angle @xmath51 is undefined ( @xmath56 ) while at @xmath57 the angle @xmath52 is undefined ( @xmath58 , so @xmath59 ) .",
    "although at these temperatures our formulae are useless one can use the continuity of the free energy and calculate it using a limiting procedure .",
    "because the lower critical dimension of the ising model equals two ( @xmath60 ) , no true transition may occur in a two - dimensional ising strip with finite @xmath2 . on the other hand , the infinite 2d ising model experiences the critical point behaviour at @xmath57 , while in the semi - infinite 2d ising model with the surface field @xmath4 , the critical wetting transition takes place at @xmath55 , @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "below , we discuss the properties of and on this basis we define the characteristic temperatures @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    first we consider @xmath64 case , for which @xmath65 , see . for small enough temperatures",
    "the left - hand side of is an increasing function of @xmath66 , it equals 0 for @xmath54 , and thus this equation does not have a solution for @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath40 are thus found from with @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "however , when @xmath69 is getting close to @xmath70 the situation becomes different : the left - hand side of  upon increasing @xmath66  first decreases , has a minimum and then increases . as a result has a solution for @xmath38 .",
    "at the same time , to obtain coefficient @xmath39 equation must be used with @xmath67 . the @xmath2-dependent temperature , which separates the above two possibilities",
    "is denoted by @xmath62 .",
    "when @xmath71 , one has @xmath72 and all coefficients @xmath27 are defined by .",
    "for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and for temperatures well above @xmath32 equation does not have solution for @xmath37 ; the coefficient @xmath39 can be calculated from with @xmath75 .",
    "when @xmath69 is close to @xmath32 the left - hand side of is a non - monotonic function of @xmath66 , and thus the solution exists for any @xmath76 .",
    "the characteristic temperature separating these two cases is denoted by @xmath63 .",
    "typical plots of the left - hand side of are shown in .    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]",
    "in this article we considered the two - dimensional ising strip of width @xmath2 with surface fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 acting on the boundaries of the system .",
    "we considered only symmetric ( @xmath13 ) and antisymmetric ( @xmath14 ) configurations of the surface fields .",
    "we introduced two pseudotransition temperatures : @xmath62 and @xmath63 . around @xmath62 , in the antisymmetric case , the interface separating two magnetic phases moves from position close to one wall to the centre of the strip . at @xmath63",
    "the difference between the two phases disappears .",
    "the existence of these two temperatures follows from the properties of our solution for the free energy .",
    "we proved that @xmath62 and @xmath63 have the same scaling properties as real transition temperatures in higher dimensions .",
    "we also checked scaling relations of @xmath62 postulated by parry and evans @xcite .",
    "the major part of our analysis was concentrated on the properties of the solvation force .",
    "we calculated this force as a function of temperature @xmath69 , surface field @xmath4 and strip width @xmath2 . for symmetric surface fields",
    "this force is always negative ( attractive ) . for strong surface fields",
    "the solvation force has a minimum above the bulk critical temperature of the 2d system @xmath32 , while for small surface fields the minimum is located below @xmath32 .",
    "there exists a range of surface fields for which this force has two minima . for antisymmetric surface fields ( and @xmath77 )",
    "the solvation force changes the sign : it is negative for small temperatures and positive ( repulsive ) for high temperatures .",
    "the temperature @xmath78 at which the solvation force is zero is located very close to the wetting temperature of the semi - infinite system @xmath70 . for large surface fields",
    "the solvation force has a maximum below @xmath32 .",
    "when the surface field is decreased , this maximum crosses @xmath32 . upon further decrease of @xmath4",
    "the maximum disappears .    to explain these properties we proposed scaling functions in three different scaling regimes : at @xmath70 , at @xmath32 , and in the case when @xmath79 .    for antisymmetric surface fields close to @xmath70 we found scaling in the limit @xmath80 and @xmath81 with @xmath82 fixed .",
    "we succeeded in finding the analytical formula for the scaling function and used it to explain the behaviour of the solvation force .",
    "the scaling function is nonuniversal , i.e. it depends on the magnitude of surface field .",
    "close to @xmath32 the scaling limit is @xmath83 and @xmath84 with @xmath85 fixed . for both symmetric and antisymmetric surface fields the obtained scaling function is , within our numerical accuracy , independent of @xmath4 for @xmath86 .",
    "we also showed analytically that the difference between scaling functions in both configurations of surface fields is independent of @xmath4 . using properties of such obtained scaling functions we explained the location of maxima and minima of the solvation force around @xmath32 for strong surface fields .",
    "the third scaling limit corresponds to @xmath87 , which implies @xmath79 , @xmath88 and",
    "@xmath80 with @xmath85 and @xmath89 fixed . in this limit we calculated the scaling function numerically and checked that it explains the location of minima and maxima of the solvation force for small surface fields .    helpful discussions with a. macioek , d. danchev , s. dietrich , o. vasilyev , and f. toldin are gratefully acknowledged .",
    "in this appendix we explain methods used to calculate the scaling functions . from and we get the formula @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 . function @xmath94 can be calculated numerically with arbitrary numerical precision . however , when @xmath2 is large or high precision is required , the time spend on calculation becomes very long .",
    "although the limiting value @xmath90 can not be calculated exactly , it may be estimated in several ways .",
    "one possibility is to fix a large but finite @xmath2 and assume @xmath95 this method was used in @xcite with @xmath96 .      to overcome this problem and to estimate the value of @xmath90 we calculate the values of @xmath98 for @xmath99 and fit the results to the formula @xmath100 which we assume to reflect the form of leading corrections to the scaling .",
    "we take @xmath101 as our estimate of @xmath90 .",
    "the accuracy of this algorithm depends on values of parameters @xmath102 , @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "the larger values used the more accurate the result is ; we used @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the accuracy of such obtained results may be estimated by comparing them with the results obtained for different values of @xmath102 .",
    "in addition , to test our results we used with @xmath106 calculated analytically . the obtained relative accuracy is better than @xmath107 .",
