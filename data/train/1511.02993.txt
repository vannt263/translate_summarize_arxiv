    "the globular clusters ( gcs ) in the milky way are excellent probes to study the galaxy s formation history .",
    "one of the major goals in contemporary astrophysics is to understand the stellar mass functions ( mfs ) of gcs , because they are thought to contain original information about the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "a number of physical processes can cause the imf to vary , including fragmentation , accretion , feedback , stellar interactions , and magnetic - field contributions @xcite . a detailed understanding of the imf is required to study the stellar populations of external galaxies , which would otherwise be impossible to study owing to their unresolved nature .",
    "however , it is not simple to derive the imf from an observed present - day mf , since the latter is affected by both observational and theoretical limitations : observationally , it is significantly impaired by the crowding of gcs , photometric uncertainties , and the observational field of view , which can lead to significant biases when attempting to determine the underlying stellar luminosity function ( lf ; * ? ? ?",
    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that the mass  luminosity relation ( mlr ) , which is required to transform the observed stellar luminosities to the corresponding masses , is metallicity- and age - dependent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "theoretical mlrs for intermediate and high stellar masses ( @xmath7 ) are relatively well constrained observationally , but at the low - mass end ( @xmath8 ) significant uncertainties remain .",
    "in addition , the mf can also be modified by dynamical processes over a cluster s lifetime .",
    "for instance , tidal interactions with the milky way s gravitational potential affect the outskirts of clusters @xcite , while mass segregation affects their central regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "despite all these observational and theoretical challenges , the mf of the galactic gc 47 tucanae ( 47 tuc ) has been studied extensively .",
    "@xcite showed that the 47 tuc mf in the cluster s central region can be approximated by a power - law distribution , i.e. , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 for the stellar mass range of 0.2@xmath11 ; @xcite and @xcite showed that the mf at a location between @xmath12 and @xmath13 from the center ( close to the cluster s half - mass radius ) is a power law with @xmath14 for the mass range of 0.30.8 @xmath15 , but that it flattens in the range 0.140.3 @xmath15 .",
    "comparison with the most recent monte carlo simulations by @xcite showed that the stars above the main - sequence ( ms ) turn - off in 47 tuc obey a power - law with @xmath16 and follow a relatively flat imf with an index of about 0.4 along the lower ms .",
    "this mass distribution is much shallower than that found based on the ground - based observations of @xcite , who determined an index of 1.2 for the mass range of 0.50.8 @xmath15 .",
    "however , all stellar mfs investigated in previous studies pertained to specific loci in the cluster ; some were located in the cluster center , some were based on data from its periphery , and some were determined around the half - mass radius . here",
    "we present a systematic analysis covering a much larger radial range using ground - based data obtained with the 4 m _ visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy _ ( vista ) telescope as part of the vista survey of the magellanic clouds ( vmc ) , combined with _",

    "smc tile 5@xmath172 can not be used for the field - star decontamination , since the cluster s tidal radius can reach @xmath26 @xcite , which essentially covers the entire tile . for background star decontamination , it is crucial to find a region that is representative both in terms of the star counts from the milky way and their counterparts from the variable smc background .",
    "the bottom right - hand corner of the field , shown in cyan in fig .",
    "[ fig : spatial_distri ] and contained in smc tile 4@xmath172 , is ideal for our decontamination of the cluster s color  magnitude diagram ( cmd ) from background stars , for two reasons .",
    "first , it is located at the same galactic latitude as 47 tuc so that galactic field contamination should be similar to that affecting our 47 tuc observations ; second , this region is located at a suitable distance from both 47 tuc and the smc , thus minimizing the number of possible residual 47 tuc and smc stars .",
    "we therefore adopted a region dominated by the 47 tuc member stars centered at @xmath27 , @xmath28 and within a radius of @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "a second region , shown in cyan in fig . [ fig : spatial_distri ] , centered on @xmath30 , @xmath31 with a radius of @xmath32 , was adopted to calculate the background stellar density .",
    "@xcite showed , for the same vmc data , that the observational completeness levels drop off rapidly in the cluster s inner region .",
    "this is caused by a combination of the increased blending probability and the enhanced background brightness .",
    "they performed a large number of artificial - star tests to study the effects of crowding on the uncertainties in the resulting psf photometry . for details of the artificial - star tests",
    ", please refer to @xcite .",
    "the latter authors generated @xmath33 artificial stars in the image and repeated their psf photometry in the same manner as for our sample of real stars .",
    "this resulted in an artificial - star catalog that contained the input and output magnitudes , as well as the photometric errors , computed as `` output minus input '' magnitudes .",
    "our observations completeness reaches a level of 50% at @xmath34 mag within a radius of @xmath35 from the cluster center .",
    "we therefore restricted our study to ms stars in an annulus defined by @xmath36''$ ] and @xmath25 $ ] mag .",
    "we also made use of two different _ hst _ data sets of 47 tuc to study the cluster s central regions , @xmath37''$ ] , which are not resolved by the vmc data .",
    "both data sets were obtained with _",
    "_ s advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) .",
    "one of the data sets was taken as part of the globular cluster treasury program ( pi : a. sarajedini ; * ? ? ?",

    "we directly use the @xcite catalog : see the blue data points in fig .",

    "second , we used observations obtained by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ka12 ) , who collected photometry for white dwarfs in 47 tuc based on 121 orbits of cycle 17 _ hst _ observations .",
    "their main goal was to obtain photometry in the acs f606w and f814w filters with extremely long exposure times to reach very faint magnitudes ( approaching 29 mag in f606w ) to study the entirety of the white dwarf cooling sequence in the cluster .",
    "the advantages of using the ka12 data are , first , that their field is located @xmath2 ( 8.8 pc ) west of the cluster center .",
    "this region is neither too sparse nor too crowded for our analysis .",
    "it allows us to resolve large numbers of ms stars down to very low luminosities .",
    "second , the authors completeness tests demonstrate that their photometry is very precise and place the 50% completeness limit for the f606w filter at 29.75 mag . a detailed discussion of the observations and the corresponding data reduction can be found in ka12 .",
    "the ka12 catalog data points are colored orange in fig .",

    "the theoretical isochrones we used to fit our cmds were taken from the dartmouth stellar evolution program ( * ? ? ?",

    "the completeness - corrected local lfs based on the two _ hst _ data sets are shown in the top panel of fig . [",

    "the stars in both cmds were divided into 15 bins .",

    "the vertical dashed lines in both panels indicate the decline on the left of the dashed line for sa07 and the deficit on the right for the ka12 data .",
    "we consequently truncated the lf based on the sa07 data at the luminosity where the linear regime ( indicated in green ) is fitted adequately by a power law , i.e. @xmath49 , where @xmath50 corresponds to the number of stars per unit luminosity @xmath51 . to determine @xmath6 statistically robustly , we ran monte carlo simulations , assuming that the stellar number counts in each bin are well - represented by gaussian distributions .",
    "we then randomly drew stellar number counts from each bin to construct our sample lfs and fitted the results using a power law to obtain @xmath6 . this random sampling based on gaussian distributions in each bin",
    "was repeated @xmath52 times .",

    "similarly to our approach pertaining to the lfs , we truncated the sa07 mf where it starts to deviate from a power - law distribution and fitted a power law to this part of the mf .",

    "the mfs are all power laws and exhibit almost constant @xmath6 indices .",
    "the mean value of the five indices is @xmath65 , with a standard derivation of @xmath66 .",
    "we will discuss this flat trend in @xmath6 index in the next section in the context of the effects of mass segregation and tidal stripping .",
    "for comparison , @xcite found @xmath67 for the mf of low - mass dwarfs in the field over the mass range @xmath68 , while @xcite determined that the field mf in the outer regions of the smc for the stellar mass range @xmath69 m_{\\odot}$ ] is well presented by a power - law with @xmath70 .",
    "except for the innermost annulus , our 47 tuc mfs are thus steeper than expected for field stars , which reflects the effects of dynamical processing .",
    "pc and the second - generation curve at @xmath71 pc .",
    "the purple dashed line represents the observed half - mass radius at @xmath72 pc . ]    the observed mf @xmath6 index increases from 2.31 in the central region ( sa07 ) to 3.37 at intermediate radii ( at @xmath73 ; ka12 ) .",
    "this shows that mass segregation significantly affects the resulting stellar mf as a cluster undergoes dynamical relaxation @xcite .",
    "dynamical mass segregation causes the high - mass stars to attain lower velocities , and they will thus gradually sink toward the cluster center and boost the lower - mass stars to the cluster s periphery .",
    "this will , in turn , lead to a flatter mf in the inner regions and a gradually steeper mf when moving toward the outskirts .",
    "this is evident for 47 tuc , given the observed declining mf trend for low - mass stars in the central region , and the clear drop in stellar numbers starting from a mass of @xmath74 or @xmath75 dex .",
    "this drop can not have been caused by incompleteness effects nor by field - star contamination , since the ka12 catalog is proper - motion cleaned and is 100% complete at the brightness levels of interest here .",
    "the radial diffusion of low - mass stars was recently observed for the first time by @xcite , based on a sample of young white dwarfs .",
    "this dynamical evolution can be further complicated by the recent discovery that 47 tuc hosts multiple stellar populations @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite predicted that ( i ) the first - generation ( fg ) stars in a gc can be at least 510 times more massive that the second - generation ( sg ) stars at the epoch of gc formation and ( ii ) the sg population is much more centrally concentrated than their fg counterparts .",
    "this consequently leads to different two - body relaxation timescales ( @xmath76 ) for the two populations , because @xmath77 depends on the gc mass and size for a given typical stellar mass .",
    "we emphasize that even though the observations indicate that approximately two - thirds of present - day cluster stars are sg descendants , with a substantial majority of fg stars having been stripped from their host clusters , it is still reasonable to discuss the effects of two - body relaxation on the dynamical evolution of a young 47 tuc dominated by fg stars , because the stripping of fg stars takes hundreds of myr .",
    "we therefore investigated the half - mass relaxation timescales @xmath76 _ separately _ for fg and sg stars to argue that dynamical mass segregation can indeed happen for both stellar generations in 47 tuc .",
    "figure [ fig : timescale ] shows @xmath76 as a function of the initial half - mass radius pc ( at the location of ka12 s field ) , based on dynamical modeling @xcite , which is consistent with @xmath78 pc used in the recent simulations of @xcite . ]",
    "( @xmath79 ) for fg and sg stars under the assumptions that 47 tuc is dominated by fg stars in the gc formation scenario , where we assumed a typical stellar mass for 47 tuc of @xmath80",
    ". we also assumed @xmath81 @xmath15 and @xmath82 @xmath15 , based on the following arguments .",
    "the observed total mass of 47 tuc is about @xmath83 @xmath15 @xcite , and we assume that the observed fraction of sg stars in gcs is approximately 70% ( since we do not know exactly the current total mass of sg stars in 47 tuc ) .",
    "the current total mass of sg stars is then approximately @xmath84 @xmath15 .",
    "previous theoretical models predict that the fg stars should be 510 times more massive than @xmath85 , which implies that the initial total mass of the fg stars in the cluster ( @xmath86 ) must be at least @xmath87 @xmath15 .",
    "consequently , we found that ( i ) @xmath76 of sg stars is less than 13 gyr for @xmath88 pc .",
    "this means that mass segregation of sg stars is possible for 47 tuc within the observed half - mass radius of 9.6 pc , ( ii ) @xmath76 of fg stars is less than 13 gyr for @xmath89 pc .",
    "this implies that mass segregation can also happen for the initial fg population of 47 tuc , provided that the initial fg population was as compact as the cluster s present configuration . even though the above argument is oversimplified in the sense that we have estimated @xmath76 separately for fg and sg stars while in reality the two populations will interact dynamically ,",
    "this simple estimate has shown that irrespective of the stellar generation , 47 tuc must be dynamically relaxed at its observed half - mass radius ( 9.6 pc ) , a region covered by our _ hst _ data .",
    "as opposed to the inner region of 47 tuc , the mf based on our vmc data , which covers the radial range from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , exhibits an almost constant power - law index : see fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] .",
    "this observed slight decrease of the @xmath6 index out to radii of @xmath92''$ ] , followed by the absence of any radial trend , provides evidence againsts the importance of mass segregation at these radii , which would have led to a gradual increase of @xmath6 with increasing radius ( to at least 12.3 pc @xmath93 ) .",
    "therefore , an additional dynamical effect must be contributing to this unchanged @xmath6 index .",
    "this might be due to the effects of tidal stripping , in the sense that shock interactions of 47 tuc with the galactic plane s gravitational potential can remove low - mass stars from the cluster s periphery .",
    "@xcite found that 47 tuc exhibits a rise in its local velocity dispersion at large radii ; subsequently @xcite found a similar increase in the cluster s velocity dispersion in their @xmath94-body simulations , which included the presence of the galactic tidal field .",
    "@xcite suggested that stars exhibiting abnormal velocities at large radii may be `` potential escapers , '' which is an indication of relaxation - driven evaporation , resulting in the transfer of escaping stars from a cluster to its tidal tails @xcite .",
    "based on this latter scenario , 47 tuc is expected to have cold tidal tails at relatively large radii in its outer region @xcite .",
    "therefore , the overall picture that is emerging on the basis of the observed mfs is that mass segregation leads to high - mass stars moving to the cluster core , while ejecting low - mass stars to its periphery .",
    "this is where tidal stripping occurs , which removes the low - mass stars from the cluster through gravitational interactions with the milky way s tidal field .",
    "this overall picture can be further enriched by the presence of fg and sg stars in 47 tuc .",
    "@xcite found that the fraction of red red - giant - branch ( rgb ) stars increases from the cluster s periphery ( 60% ) to its central regions ( 80% ) .",
    "@xcite used vmc data to show that the fraction of rgb and subgiant - branch stars in the core is about 90% and decreases to 10% in the cluster s periphery .",
    "we show all mf indices as a function of radius in fig .",
    "[ fig : index ] ( top ) , together with the fraction of fg stars ( middle ) and its derivative ( bottom ; smoothed ) .",
    "we note that @xmath6 peaks for @xmath95''$ ] , a region which is indicated by the two red dashed lines .",
    "the @xmath6 distribution then gradually becomes constant .",
    "this behavior coincides remarkably well with that of the derivative of the fraction of the fg of stars as a function of radius , which peaks in the same radial range .",
    "the derivative of the fraction of fg stars with radius can be intuitively interpreted as the strength of the combined effects of mass segregation and tidal stripping as a function of radius , i.e. , the closer to the core of the cluster one looks , the easier it is to observe the effects of mass segregation . at radii where mass segregation dominates",
    ", one would expect smaller fractions of fg stars to remain ; similarly , the effects of tidal stripping start to dominate from radii closer to the cluster s half - mass radius outward . the fraction of fg stars is inversely correlated with the strength of the tidal stripping process .    but",
    "why is there also such a peak at radii @xmath95''$ ] ?",
    "we suggest that this may be due to the competing effects of mass segregation on the one hand and tidal stripping on the other .",
    "the observed flattening of the mf toward the cluster core is caused by the fg massive stars having undergone mass segregation and , hence , they have migrated to the cluster center .",
    "this consequently increased the number of high - mass stars in the central regions ( and , equivalently , increased the number of low - mass stars in the periphery ) .",
    "this process can proceed very rapidly in the cluster core , particularly if the core has initial substructure @xcite .",
    "sg stars will then form spatially more centrally from recycled fg stellar matter .",
    "since the newly formed sg stars are more centrally concentrated , their spatial distribution would be relatively insensitive to the effects of tidal stripping .",
    "on the other hand , in the outskirts of the cluster , both fg and sg stars should be stripped tidally by the milky way s potential .",
    "the stripping efficiency of the two generations is different , with the fg being more efficiently stripped owing to its initially more diffuse configuration . as a consequence ,",
    "tidal stripping of low - mass fg stars leads to a flatter @xmath6 index toward larger radii , as indicated by our vmc observations .",

    "the purple solid indicates the half - mass radius at about 9.6 pc ( @xmath96 ; we adopted a distance of 4.6 kpc to 47 tuc ) from the center of the cluster . ]",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the lfs and mfs of the low - mass ms stars in 47 tuc as a function of radius .",
    "we have used near - infrared observations , obtained as part of the vmc survey , located at clustercentric radii of 5001100@xmath97 , as well as data from two complementary _ hst _ data sets , one located in the central region and the other at a distance of @xmath2 from the cluster center .",
    "our key results are as follows .",
    "the _ hst_-based lfs and mfs suggest that the stellar numbers decline for magnitudes of @xmath98 in the center of the cluster , corresponding to a mass range of @xmath1 .",
    "contrary to this result , we found that the mf at @xmath2 from the cluster center exhibits a deficit in stars at higher masses , @xmath62 .",
    "this is in support of the expectations from mass segregation , i.e. , the high - mass stars sink to the center of the cluster and dynamically boost the lower - mass stars to the outer regions .",
    "2 .   the 47 tuc lfs and mfs based on the vmc vista data all exhibit power - law shapes in the mass range @xmath99 , with slopes remaining almost unchanged .",
    "this is likely due to tidal stripping , which is expected to remove the lower - mass fg stars from the outer regions of the cluster .",
    "3 .   combining the vmc and _ hst _ observations , the mf index increases from the inner region outward and reaches a peak at a radius of about 380500@xmath97 ; it subsequently decreases and remains constant toward the cluster s periphery .",
    "this peak in the @xmath6 distribution at radii @xmath95''$ ] ( close to the half - mass radius ) could be due to the combined effects of mass segregation and tidal stripping on the cluster s fg and sg stars .",
