    "[ rd1 ] ) , but also imply that although the asymmetric profile may be a sufficient condition for identification of a strong line with , it is not a necessary condition .",
    "this point is particularly important for judging the identification of serendipitous and narrow - band survey emission sources whose spectra are dominated by a solitary , high equivalent width emission line .",
    "second , if  emission is primarily a function of kinematics and perhaps evolutionary phase of a starburst , attempts to derive the co - moving star - formation rate at high redshifts from emission will require substantial and uncertain assumptions regarding the relation of observed  properties to the intrinsic star formation rate ; use of the uv continuum ( @xmath27  ) may be preferred for measuring star formation rates .",
    "we now consider the biases which affect the various galaxy search techniques discussed in  [ sectz5notopt ] and  [ sectz5optir ] .",
    "each technique provides a shaded view of the deep extragalactic universe ; we enumerate these differences in the same order that the various techniques were presented .",
    "radio galaxies are classical agn .",
    "this implies , according to the prevailing models of active galaxies , the presence of a supermassive black hole .",
    "nearby radio galaxies are associated with large early - type galaxies , both cds in the centers of clusters and giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "conventional wisdom states that hzrgs are the precursors to these early - type systems ; our bias may simply be that hzrgs sample the most massive systems . at the least ,",
    "though , hzrgs necessitate the presence of a supermassive black hole in the early universe .",
    "the time scale of supermassive black hole formation is not well - known ( loeb 1993 ) .",
    "are black holes the seeds of early galaxy formation , or are they the fruit of it ?",
    "the radio source itself most likely affects the assembly of the galactic sub - units , triggering star - formation along the radio jets in at least some cases ( dey et  al .",
    "if hzrgs are indeed found to be the precursors of the most massive early - type systems , radio galaxies at high redshift may prove to be most important for studies of the formation of galaxy clusters and large scale structure .",
    "sub - mm and infrared - selected ( lirg ) sources require much of their bolometric luminosity to be dust - reprocessed radiation emitted at long wavelength . in an extreme scenario",
    ", one could imagine a dust - enshrouded starburst in which no radiation short - ward of a few microns escaped a restricted spatial region .",
    "such a source at high redshift would escape detection in contemporary optical / near - infrared surveys ; it would perhaps only be detected in the 850@xmath28 m sub - mm region .",
    "have any such sources been identified already ?",
    "astrometric uncertainties and the large beam - size of the scuba detector leave the question open .",
    "it is conceivable that one or more of the hughes et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) sub - mm sources in the hdf lack optical / near - infrared identifications , even to the extremely deep limits of the hdf .",
    "though studies of field sub - mm sources are in their nascent phases , it is likely these systems represent those galaxies in the distant universe undergoing the most vigorous bursts of star formation .",
    "we are far from the time when we can reliably relate these distant sources to the local census of galaxies , but conceiving of the sub - mm population as the more distant cousins of ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) seems plausible , if not likely ( lilly et  al .",
    "1999 ) . at the least , sub - mm galaxies are important as they produce a significant fraction ( @xmath29% ) of the total bolometric output of the universe averaged over all wavelengths and epochs ( lilly et  al .",
    "1999 ) and largely ( entirely ? ) account for the sub - mm background .",

    "galaxy clusters sample the deepest potential wells in the universe on mpc scales .",
    "studies of the most distant x - ray clusters will provide valuable information on the formation of large - scale structure .",
    "in particular , several authors have noted the sharp dependence of the evolution of cluster abundances on basic cosmological parameters ( eke et  al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the first optical identification of a grb occurred less than two years ago , and our understanding of these intriguing sources , though much improved , is still rather sparse .",
    "are grbs more prevalent in young stellar systems with many massive remnants ?",
    "are they correlated with sne explosions ?",
    "it is premature to comment too deeply on what biases grb - selected host galaxies may yield on our understanding of the distant universe . at the least , they are not _ all _ heavily reddened , which has implications for the prevalence of dust in the universe .",
    "lyman - break galaxies and photometrically - selected young galaxies at high redshift are biased against dusty systems and older populations which would redden the observed spectral energy distributions and likely lead to redshift ambiguities .",
    "the main bias is that these techniques only search for galaxies containing a very young , ob star - rich , stellar population which dominates the rest - frame continuum in the wavelength range @xmath30 ",
    ". a small contribution by an older population of stars will not be very noticeable at the observed , deep - ultraviolet wavelengths available for study at high redshift .",
    "near - infrared studies with spectrographs on the new generation of @xmath31  m telescopes , and later from ngst , will provide critical information on the masses , kinematics , ages , and dust abundance in this population .",
    "are we only skimming the envelope of the most dust - poor young systems ?",
    "the relation of the lyman - break galaxies to the local galaxy population remains uncertain .",
    "searches for distant galaxies have a clear , but uncertain , observational bias ; strong  emission ( @xmath32  ) tends to be biased against dusty galaxies , or at least against galaxies whose neutral gas has unfavorable geometry / kinematics .",
    "spectroscopy of the lyman - break population reveals that approximately half of the galaxies show  in _ absorption_. in fact , deep narrow - band imaging compared to broad - band images can show these systems as negative holes ( steidel 2000 ) ! however , most astronomers involved in  surveys are restricting their search to emission - line sources .",
    "the surface densities measured ( see table  [ tabsurfden ] ) are comparable to those measured for lyman - break galaxies .",
    "the implication is that a large population of strong  emitters exist which have fainter continua than the limits of the photometric surveys .",
    "if the morphology of the  emission primarily depends upon the kinematics of the neutral gas as suggested by ultraviolet studies of local metal - poor galaxies (  [ sectz5lowz ] ) , then caution should be advised in deriving star formation rates and densities from the -emitting galaxies .",
    "observational study of normal galaxies at @xmath33 is still a rather recent phenomenon .",
    "the last invited review on the subject to this journal , only five years past ( pritchet 1994 ) , began with the sad pronouncement that the predicted widespread population of primeval galaxies had thus far escaped detection . at the time",
    ", our knowledge of individual sources at @xmath2 was restricted to a dozen or so radio galaxies and a larger census of quasars . now",
    "the pioneering work of steidel and collaborators has uncovered several hundreds of lyman - break systems at @xmath33 and spectroscopically confirmed galaxies have recently crossed the @xmath34 barrier .",
    "studies of the earliest epochs of the universe are no longer restricted to agn and quasar enthusiasts : since 1997 december ( franx et  al . 1997 ) the most distant sources known to astronomers have consistently been apparently normal , star - forming galaxies . though this review emphasizes the search techniques for identifying distant galaxies , we now briefly consider what has been and can be learned about the early universe from these studies",
    ".      our various types of distant galaxies may be illustrative of peculiar , rare denizens of the cosmic past ( the few powerful steep - spectrum radio sources at @xmath35 ) or they may be more modest star - forming citizens , representative of an era when normal galaxies were modest fractions of @xmath16 and @xmath36 , typical luminosities and masses of the current cosmic epoch near @xmath1 .    in table",

    "gwyn ( 2000 ) notes significant differences in the distribution of photometric redshifts between the hdf - n and the hdf - s .",
    "similarly , since the hdf samples a very small volume of the local universe , the low - redshift surface densities are poorly determined .",
