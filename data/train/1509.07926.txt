    "the draw of magnetic semiconductors is readily apparent from the name ; they offer an opportunity to blend magnetic and semiconducting properties in a single material . in spintronics ,",
    "this is especially relevant because of the additional means of interaction through the magnetic and electrical properties of carriers .",
    "dilute magnetic semiconductors@xcite are unique in that they marry a low - magnetism ferromagnet with a semiconductor capable of maintaining long spin lifetimes .",
    "this makes possible the manipulation of carrier spins by ferromagnetic switching or , in the non - magnetic state , through more traditional means like optical excitation .",
    "while these materials are a reality , the ferromagnetic transitions are so far confined to well below room temperature.@xcite nonetheless , the potential for these materials warrants their study , not to mention their suitability for studying spin systems near critical transitions , like a ferromagnetic transition .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the impact of a ferromagnetic transition on carrier spin lifetimes .",
    "strong spin fluctuations are expected for the constituents driving a ferromagnetic phase change.@xcite these fluctuations can manifest themselves through enhanced carrier scattering . in the dyakonov - perel spin relaxation mechanism,@xcite spin lifetimes are typically inversely related to scattering lifetimes .",
    "this is because the relaxation process occurs between collisions , due to precession of the spin in the spin - orbit field .",
    "then , in the dyakonov - perel mechanism , enhanced scattering due to spin fluctuations disrupts spin precession and can inhibit the rate of spin relaxation . under these circumstances , we can find a crossover in the dominant spin relaxation mechanism to one based on spin flips in scattering .",
    "spin flips can occur in scattering , for example , due to the mixing of spin - up and spin - down states from a spin - orbit interaction ; this is the premise of the elliott - yafet spin relaxation mechanism.@xcite in a ferromagnetic system , an even greater rate of spin flips in interaction is made possible by transfer of spin between itinerant carriers and magnetic impurities .",
    "we model a ferromagnetic transition in a dilute magnetic semiconductor with a degenerate gas of itinerant carriers ( electrons or holes ) interacting via spin exchange with dilute localized magnetic impurities .",
    "gamnas is the prototypical material to which this model has been applied  not without controversy over the hole transport mechanism.@xcite gagdn is another example : here it is the @xmath0-@xmath1 exchange interaction ( as opposed to @xmath0-@xmath2 interaction ) that drives the ferromagnetic transition.@xcite in this paper , we will keep the discussion fairly general , applying parameters related to a gamnas system for the sake of calculations and analysis , but noting that the model is meant more as an example of critical phenomena than an exact description of gamnas .",
    "other articles have examined the critical behavior of gamnas in more detail.@xcite our treatment is mean - field - like in that spin fluctuations and the interaction they mediate between the carriers are at the level of a random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "thus , we ignore critical fluctuations which presumably lead to large corrections to the quasiparticle spectrum in the immediate vicinity of the ferromagnetic transition .",
    "derivations of spin relaxation times resulting from spin dependent scattering are presented for two mechanisms : transfer of spin from carriers to magnetic impurities and dyakonov - perel .",
    "the results we obtain are applicable to dynamic , spin - polarized systems and focus primarily on the contribution of carrier - carrier interactions mediated by the spin fluctuations of magnetic impurities .",
    "we apply common fermi liquid theory techniques , beginning with the kadanoff - baym kinetic equation . by utilizing the gw approximation for the carrier self - energy ,",
    "we obtain relatively simple and easy to calculate expressions for the spin relaxation rate , which are generally applicable to a wide variety of effective interactions .",
    "the results derived here follow previous analytic@xcite and computational@xcite studies , but extend them significantly by including dynamics and spin exchange .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ eff_int ] , we present an effective interaction that can be used to generate a ferromagnetic transition and which will be used to calculate carrier scattering rates ; in section  [ fmp ] , we discuss the ferromagnetic phase change and the behavior of the scattering amplitude near the transition ; in section  [ sr ] we derive analytic expressions for the rate of spin relaxation due to spin - flips in scattering and the dyakonov - perel mechanism ; in section  [ discussion ] , we discuss some results of spin relaxation across a ferromagnetic transition ; section  [ conclusion ] contains our concluding remarks .",

    "the interaction @xmath21 between carriers and impurities allows for the possibility of non - zero average spins @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the absence of external fields .",

    "typically , spin relaxation is understood to be the evolution of out - of - equilibrium polarized spins into an unpolarized equilibrium state . in a ferromagnetic system where there is an equilibrium spin polarization",
    ", spin relaxation refers to the evolution of non - equilibrium spins into the polarized equilibrium state .",
    "thus , rather than picturing the process as decay of polarization , we understand it as restoration of equilibrium polarization .",
    "we focus on two mechanisms of carrier spin relaxation : transfer of spin to magnetic impurities ( mi ) and dyakonov - perel ( dp ) . under a wide variety of temperatures , scattering sources , and degeneracy ,",
    "the dp mechanism dominates in iii - v semiconductors.@xcite thus , we find it relevant to include derivations for this spin relaxation mechanism here .",
    "as will become evident , however , the inverse relationship between scattering and spin relaxation in the dp mechanism hinders its effectiveness when the interaction that is responsible for carrier - carrier scattering becomes strong and long - ranged , e.g. near the ferromagnetic transition .",
    "this leads to a change in dominant carrier spin relaxation mechanism near the ferromagnetic transition .",
    "both the mi and the elliott - yafet ( ey ) mechanisms rely on spin flips in scattering ; thus , they scale proportionally to the scattering rate and become more important when the carrier - carrier interaction becomes strong .",
    "this point is in agreement with morandi , _ _ et al.__@xcite , who find that spin - flip - based spin relaxation mechanisms ( including a small elliott - yafet contribution ) are important when spin - dependent scattering is dominant .",
    "however , the timescales of these two mechanisms are very different .",
    "since ey depends on the weak spin - orbit field to allow spin flips in interaction , it is generally negligible when mi processes are occurring .",
    "this leads us to identify mi as the dominant spin relaxation mechanism near the ferromagnetic transition , and so we neglect the ey mechanism in the following derivations .",
    "nevertheless , even when mi dominates , there is a role left for ey to further relax the total magnetization of impurities plus carriers after the total spin angular momentum has reached equilibrium .",
    "this will be qualitatively discussed in section v. notice that the enhanced carrier - carrier collision rate near the transition is not in opposition with , but rather the consequence of the critical slowing down of the collective spin dynamics of the carrier - impurity system .",

    "our expression   for the effective scattering rate in the dp mechanism has some noteworthy features that make it qualitatively different from the previous known result in eq .  , which holds for spin - independent interactions .",

    "the analogy for the effective scattering rate is that zero - momentum transfers do not relocate particles in a @xmath97-dependent magnetic field , so spins can continue to precess around the same magnetic field axis and those scattering events do not reduce the rate of spin relaxation .",
    "this analogy is not appropriate for spin - dependent scattering , where processes with zero momentum transfer may still change spin orientation .",
    "in fact , what we find is a sort of generalized dp spin relaxation , where spin - dependent and spin - independent scattering should both be taken into account for the overall disruption of spin precessions in a spin - orbit field .    the effective scattering rate from eq .",

    "[ fig : esrvmrt ] for varying interaction strengths and carrier densities . unlike previous reports",

    "this is an indication that spin exchange and spin flip processes become very important near the critical temperature .",
    "an interesting consequence of the effective interaction used in this paper is that the peak rates of momentum relaxation at @xmath227 only indirectly depend on @xmath21 through the temperature dependence in @xmath228 , and not through the effective interaction @xmath229 .",
    "this is most easily understood by approaching the ferromagnetic transition from the paramagnetic side .",
    "the non - interacting spin response for impurities can be cast as @xmath230^{-1}$ ] , so that the effective interaction reduces to @xmath231^{-1}.\\ ] ] at @xmath227 , there is neither an explicit dependence on @xmath21 nor on @xmath69 ; we are left with an interaction that only depends on the non - interacting carrier response .",
    "the effect of this is @xmath228 plays the primary role for the temperature dependence . in the small frequency limit",
    ", this factor goes as @xmath232 .",
    "then , higher critical temperatures have greater scattering rates associated with them ; this is verified by fig .  [ fig : esrvmrt]a . on the other hand , the heights of these scattering peaks are largely independent of the carrier density @xmath233 , seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : esrvmrt]b .",
    "the primary contribution of carrier density comes from the cut - off frequency @xmath234 in each of the response functions .",
    "turning our attention to spin relaxation , the expressions derived for dp spin relaxation rely on the assumption that scattering lifetimes are shorter by roughly an order of magnitude than spin lifetimes .",
    "else , spins are free to precess in a spin - orbit field and scattering does not appreciably affect the rate of spin relaxation.@xcite this is especially relevant for hole spins in iii - v semiconductors , as they experience stronger spin - orbit interactions than electrons.@xcite in fig .",

    "[ fig : esrvmrt ] are indeed fast enough to inhibit spin relaxation in the dp mechanism . near the ferromagnetic transition ,",
    "the mechanism becomes quite ineffective .",
    "an interesting consequence of carrier spins relaxing by spin exchange with magnetic impurities is the total spin of the system is conserved , which is obviously not the case for spin - orbit based spin relaxation . near the ferromagnetic transition",
    ", this total - spin - conserving relaxation mechanism is very efficient and a quasi - equilibrium spin polarization is reached quickly . from here , spin - orbit based spin relaxation continues to relax carrier spins at a much slower rate until a final stage of equilibrium is reached .",
    "this two - stage relaxation process should be observable by a kink in the time evolution of the magnetization . from simple calculations reported in appendix  [ eq_mi ]",
    ", we predict this quasi - equilibrium state to have a magnetization in the @xmath95-direction of @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the initial magnetization .",
    "the magnetic susceptibilities here do not have @xmath15-factors absorbed .",
    "this highlights the importance of the @xmath15-factors in defining the quasi - equilibrium state .    further comparing the spin relaxation mechanisms ,",
    "a reasonable question to ask is whether the rates of mi , dp , and ey can be summed according to matthiessen s rule .",
    "this would not be appropriate , as the mi mechanism relaxes spins to a different equilibrium state than dp and ey . especially considering the timescales",
    "at which each spin relaxation mechanism operates near the ferromagnetic transition , it makes more sense to order the events as mi spin relaxation to reach a quasi - equilibrium state , and then ey + dp spin relaxation to bring the system to its final equilibrium state where the total spin of the system has decreased .",
    "we worked with a zener model of dilute magnetic semiconductors , which exhibits a ferromagnetic transition due to itinerant carriers interacting via spin exchange with localized magnetic impurities .",
    "we used this model to derive effective mean - field spin interactions between carriers for many - body calculations . from here , we found analytic expressions for spin - flip spin relaxation , due to exchange of spin between carriers and magnetic impurities , and dyakonov - perel .",
    "these expressions are valid for degenerate carriers with arbitrary spin polarization and can be used with a variety of spin - dependent dynamic interactions .",
    "we also studied the relative effectiveness of these spin relaxation mechanisms near a ferromagnetic instability . in the dyakonov - perel mechanism , spin fluctuations act as effective scatterers , significantly inhibiting the rate of spin relaxation by precession in a spin - orbit field .",
    "when this occurs , spin - flip based spin relaxation mechanisms become dominant . when these spin - flips are due to exchange with magnetic impurities , the total spin of the system is conserved and two stages of spin relaxation are expected : fast relaxation occurs due to spin exchange and leads to a quasi - equilibrium polarization ; this is followed by slower relaxation which dissipates spin to a spin - orbit field .",

    "ilya tokatly for extensive and enlightening discussions on spin - dependent interactions in the collision integral for a fermi liquid .",
    "in the time - domain , the gkb ansatz is written@xcite @xmath237 we consider here green s functions which are matrices in spin - space .",

    "then , the spin - indexed gkb ansatz can not be simply written in terms of @xmath175 , but instead has the following form : @xmath243",
    "we seek the intermediate state of spin relaxation where carriers have quickly drained their spin into magnetic impurities and begin a slower loss of spin to orbital angular momentum via spin - orbit based spin relaxation mechanisms .",
    "spin - exchange interactions between carriers and magnetic impurities preserve the total spin @xmath244 , but as these particles in general have different @xmath15-factors , the magnetization is not preserved . in what follows , we consider the @xmath95-components of all quantities without explicitly denoting this .",
    "the equilibrium spin densities are determined by minimizing the free energy @xmath245 with respect to @xmath246 and @xmath247 at constant field @xmath248 .",
    "when we remove the magnetic field , we must minimize the free energy subject to the constraint @xmath249 .",
