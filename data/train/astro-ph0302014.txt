    "it has been established in recent years that a number of galactic black hole ( bh ) candidates show quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) behaviours spanning a wide range of frequency starting from a few tens of millihertz to a few hundred hz ( see cui 1999 for a review ) .",
    "the characteristic features of these qpos suggest that such oscillations are a diagnostic of the accretion processes in the inner regions of the accretion discs around the central compact objects , like shock oscillations in sub - keplerian advective accretion discs ( chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 , ct hereafter , molteni , sponholz & chakrabarti 1996 , msc hereafter , kazanas , hua & titarchuk 1997 , titarchuk , lapidus & muslimov 1998 , chakrabarti & manickam 2000 , cm hereafter ) . the galactic microquasar grs 1915 + 105 shows several properties which indicate that qpos may be generated because of the oscillation of the hot , dense inner regions of black hole accretion discs ( paul et al .",

    "numerical simulation of msc revealed the fact that for shocked non - spherical advective bh accretion flow , if the inflow and cooling parameters are properly tuned , the post - shock cooling time becomes comparable to the advection time - scale from the shock .",
    "a shocked flow may continuously try to adjust itself , resulting in the quasi - periodic radial oscillation of the shock around its mean steady - state solution , with an oscillation frequency roughly equal to the reciprocal of the post - shock advection time scale @xmath1 .",
    "such oscillations do not depend on the details of the cooling mechanism ( cm ) and may cause the quasi - periodic variation of the luminosity emerging out of the post - shock region of the accretion disc by dynamically modulating the size and the radiative properties of the comptonizing cloud ( ct ) .",
    "one thus expects that the shock formation in multi - transonic advective bh accretion discs may play a crucial role in producing qpos .",
    "+ in this letter , we study how sensitive shock oscillation is to the parameters governing the bh accretion , which has never been done in any of the works existing in the literature .",
    "our main motivation in this letter is to provide a generalized self - consistent computation of various shock parameters @xmath2 in terms of fundamental inflow variables @xmath3 for accretion in _ all _ available post - newtonian pseudo - schwarzschild bh potentials , and then to use these parameters to estimate the value of @xmath4 .",
    "we also study the dependence of @xmath4 on all @xmath5 and @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that the shock solutions we obtain in this letter , satisfy the criteria of fine tuning inbetween the post - shock advection and cooling time scales so that shocked flow oscillates with a frequency @xmath6 even for realistic flows with all dissipative terms included .",
    "our generalized formalism assures that our results are not just an artifact of a particular type of potential only and inclusion of every bh potential allows a substantially extended zone of parameter space allowing for the possibility of shock induced qpos .",
    "also , there are possibilities that in future someone may come up with a pseudo - schwarzschild potential better than any of the bh potentials available in the literature , which will be the best approximation for complete general relativistic investigation of multi - transonic shocked flow . in such case , if one already formulates a generalized model for multi - transonic shocked accretion disc for any arbitrary potential , exactly what we have done in this paper , then that generalized model will be able to readily accommodate that new potential without requiring any significant change in the fundamental structure of the formulation and solution scheme of the model and we need not worry about providing any new scheme exclusively valid only for that new potential , if any .",
    "following are the four pseudo - potentials on which we concentrate in this work : @xmath7\\ ] ] @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the radial co - ordinate scaled in units of schwarzschild radius @xmath10 ( = @xmath11 ) . throughout this paper",
    "the radial distances and velocities are scaled in units of @xmath10 and @xmath12 respectively and all other derived quantities are scaled accordingly . also @xmath13 is used . in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , @xmath14 and @xmath15 had been proposed by paczyski & witta ( 1980 ) and nowak & wagoner ( 1991 ) respectively , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are suggested by artemova et al ( 1996 ) . for these potentials , das ( 2002 ,",
    "d02 hereafter ) and das , pendharkar & mitra ( 2003 , dpm hereafter ) have provided a unified approach for shock solutions in multi - transonic black hole accretion disc for non - dissipative shocks in polytropic flow ( d02 ) as well as in dissipative shocks in isothermal flows ( dpm ) .",
    "we follow the formalism presented in d02 and dpm to calculate @xmath2 for evaluating @xmath4 .      for this case ,",
    "@xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the specific energy of the flow , @xmath20 is the specific flow angular momentum , and @xmath21 is the adiabatic index of the flow .",
    "we calculate the shock location @xmath22 , along with other shock parameters like shock strength @xmath23(=@xmath24 , @xmath25 being the mach number of the flow ) , shock compression ratio @xmath26(=@xmath27 , @xmath28 being the local matter density of accretion disc , related to its vertically integrated value @xmath29 as @xmath30 , @xmath31 being the local disc height and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , see matsumoto et al . 1984 ) and entropy enhancement rate at shock @xmath34 ( = @xmath35 , @xmath36 being the entropy accretion rate ) as a function of @xmath3",
    ". for low @xmath20 flow with moderate or strong shocks , the post - shock velocity is proportional to @xmath37 ( see also cm ) and one obtains : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a scaling constant .",
    "let @xmath40 be any physical quantity which changes discontinuously at the shock .",
    "we define the ratio of the post to pre - shock value of @xmath40 to be @xmath41 .",
    "we multiply the numerator and denominator of eq .",
    "( 2 ) by @xmath26 and use the following relations : @xmath42 to obtain the qpo frequency as : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the vertically integrated fluid pressure and the flow temperature respectively .",
    "@xmath46 is the ratio of flow kinetic energy to the total thermal energy content of the flow .",
    "all relevant @xmath47 and @xmath48 could be interpreted as @xmath2 . for a particular set of @xmath5 for which shock forms for any specific @xmath49 , _ all _ @xmath48s could be computed in terms of @xmath3 for _ all _ available @xmath49s , hence we claim that the expression for @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is more general compared to the qpo frequency obtained by any other previous work .",
    "a suitable choice of @xmath39 provides the maximum value of @xmath51 ( for any @xmath5 in all @xmath49 ) to be 67 hz for one eddington accretion rate onto a 10@xmath52 bh , which is the representative case for grs 1915 + 105 .",
    "hereafter , we define the normalized qpo frequency as @xmath53 . + in figure 1 . , we plot @xmath54 as a function of various fundamental @xmath3 . while the @xmath54 is plotted along z axis ( denoted by @xmath55 in the figure ) ,",
    "specific energy @xmath56 and specific angular momentum @xmath20 are plotted along x and y axis respectively for @xmath14(a ) , @xmath15(b ) , @xmath16(c ) and @xmath17(d ) .",
    "each surface represents the plot for a fixed @xmath21 .",
    "the left most surface is drawn for @xmath57 and successive surfaces to the right are drawn for @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is an integer . for @xmath14 as well as for @xmath17 , we obtain the figure for @xmath60=1 , 2 ; while for @xmath16 we use @xmath60=1 and for @xmath15 we use @xmath60=0 .",
    "it is observed from the figure that @xmath0 anti - correlates with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this indicates that the ultra - relativistic flow and @xmath61 respectively , according to the terminology used in frank et .",
    "al . 1992 . ] produces stronger qpo compared to the purely - non relativistic flows when other initial parameters are unchanged .",
    "weakly rotating flows are better candidates for producing high frequency oscillation ; this is due to the fact that the shock location anti - correlates with @xmath0 but correlates with @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "the lower the be the value of angular momentum , the closer will be the post shock region to the event horizon and more amount of the gravitational energy will be available to dump on to the oscillation energy in the post shock region . for most of the cases , @xmath0 correlates with @xmath62 while @xmath0 anti - correlates with @xmath56 for relatively fewer cases .",
    "such a @xmath63 ( anti ) correlation are supported by observational evidences that most qpos strengthen towards higher energies ( van der klis 1995 ; cui et al .",
    "1997 ; morgan et al .",
    "1997 ; remillard et al .",
    "1998 ) , although some follow the opposite trend ( morgan et al . 1997",
    "; see also remillard et al .",
    "1999 and rutledge et al .",
    "1999 for other possible cases ) .",
    "if @xmath64 represents the maximum possible value of normalized qpo frequency for a particular astrophysical source for any specific @xmath65 , we find that : @xmath66 for ultra - relativistic shocked flow in certain range of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in fig .",
    "2 , we plot @xmath54 ( plotted along the y axis and denoted by @xmath67 in the figure ) as a function of various @xmath68 for all four @xmath49 marked in the figure . to plot in the same figure ,",
    "the post shock temperature @xmath69 ( dotted line ) and the post shock vertically integrated density @xmath70 ( long dashed line ) is scaled as @xmath71 and @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are scaling constants different for four different @xmath65 .",
    "similar figures could also be drawn for _ any _ range of @xmath75 for which a shocked flow physically exists .",
    "it is evident from the figure that @xmath54 non - linearly anti - correlates with the shock location whereas it non linearly correlates with the post shock temperature and post shock density .",
    "this result may have important consequences in connection to the jet formation mechanism for galactic relativistic sources .",
    "it has been shown that ( das 1998 , das & chakrabarti 1999 ) the hot and dense post shock region of black hole accretion disc may generate accretion - powered galactic and extra - galactic outflows and the barionic load of such outflows increases with the increment of post shock flow temperature and density . from fig .",
    "2 , we conclude that there must be some relationship inbetween the normalized qpo frequencies and the amount of baryonic content of outflows from galactic microquasars ; details of such investigation is reported elsewhere ( das , rao & vadewale 2003 ) .",
    "+ in very high states of the qpos in lmxb , radiation drag might play a crucial role in accretion close to the event horizon and the qpo might be caused by the radiatively driven oscillations in a quasi - spherical accretion flow ( fortner et al .",
    "the @xmath76 co - relation presented in fig . 2 is thus expected to support such qpo states because the quasi - spherical post - shock region in our model possesses more thermal energy as it forms closer to the event horizon .",
    "for such flow , we calculate all @xmath2s and @xmath77 in terms of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the constant flow temperature .",
    "the amount of energy dissipation at shock may become as much as five to fifteen ( at most ) percent of the rest mass energy of the accreting material and may be computed as : @xmath80 this huge amount of dissipated energy may be used to power the qpo and/or to produce and power the strong x - ray flares from the bh environment .",
    "we can calculate the normalized qpo frequency for this case as : @xmath81 } { { \\re}^2_{\\sigma}r_{sh}^{\\frac{3}{2 } } } \\eqno{(7)}\\ ] ] in figure 3 .",
    "we plot the variation of @xmath54 ( plotted along the z axis and is marked as @xmath55 in the figure ) with specific angular momentum @xmath20 ( plotted along x axis ) and flow temperature ( plotted along y in the unit of @xmath82 ( = t/10@xmath83 degree @xmath84 ) and is marked as @xmath85 in the figure ) for four pseudo potentials @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "it is observed from the figure that @xmath54 anti - correlates with @xmath20 and correlates with @xmath85 , and : @xmath90 which is exactly same as that of polytropic flow , see eq .",
    "this clearly indicates that shocked accretion flow in @xmath16 generates the most intensely oscillating qpos .",
    "this indicates that the high frequency qpos observed for any astrophysical sources may , perhaps , be better explained using @xmath16 , while @xmath91 and @xmath15 are appropriate to explain the intermediate and low frequency qpos , respectively . for",
    "shocked flow in certain range of @xmath20 and @xmath79 , figure 4 represents the variation of @xmath54 ( plotted along the y axis and is denoted by @xmath67 in the figure ) with shock location @xmath22 ( solid line ) , shock compression ratio @xmath92 ( dotted line ) and energy dissipation at shock @xmath93 ( long dashed line ) .",
    "similar figures could also be drawn for _ any _ range of @xmath94 for which a shocked flow physically exists . in the figure , @xmath92 and @xmath93",
    "are scaled as @xmath95 and @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are scaling constants different for four different @xmath65 .",
    "it is observed that @xmath54 non - linearly anti - correlates with the shock location which indicates the generation of stronger oscillations closer to the event horizon as is observed in reality ( cui 1999 ) .",
    "also @xmath54 correlates with @xmath92 and @xmath93 which indicates that the stronger is the shock ( as @xmath99 , @xmath23 being the shock strength , see dpm ) , more intense is the oscillation and higher is the amount of dissipated energy at the shock locations .",
    "co - relation in between @xmath54 and @xmath93 for isothermal flow may help in understanding the characteristic features of the duration of the quiescent state of the transient x ray source grs 1915 + 105 ( das & rao , in preparation ) .",
    "in this work we have examined the dependence of normalized qpo frequencies @xmath54 on various parameters describing the generalized multi - transonic bh accretion flow with dissipative and non - dissipative shock waves .",
    "we found that @xmath54 is quite sensitive on most of the parameters responsible for producing the post shock flow , the anticipated oscillation of which may resulting the qpos .",
    "this _ indicates _ that the qpos in galactic sources are _ inherently controlled _ by shock dominated accretion flows . the fact that @xmath54 is sensitive to various flow parameters found in this work reinforces the belief that our calculation may be useful in future to understand various observational features of qpo in galactic bh candidates ,",
    "a few of which have already been addressed in  2.1 and  2.2 .",
    "we performed our calculations in a generalized way by incorporating all available pseudo - schwarzschild black hole potentials .",
