    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown explicitly that the single - gluon vertex obtained from @xmath39 at leading order in @xmath8 is not renormalized at one loop . </S>",
    "<S> we can extend this argument to the whole lagrangian to all orders in @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> when we regularize both the ultraviolet and the infrared divergences with dimensional regularization , any loop diagrams in both theories vanish since there is no scale involved , and the divergence structure is the same in the full theory and in the effective theory to all orders . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the whole lagrangian is not renormalized to all orders in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> however there is a caveat to claim this . </S>",
    "<S> the collinear effective theory is a nonlocal field theory in the coordinate @xmath80 or momentum @xmath81 , but is local in other coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to induce nonlocal operators which are not present in the tree - level lagrangian through radiative corrections . with this in mind </S>",
    "<S> , we can say that the effective lagrangian is not renormalized to all orders provided that no other nonlocal operators are induced by radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that the power counting method in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite will offer a clue to see if nonlocal operators can exist , which are not present in the original lagrangian .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the situation is quite different in the hqet . for the renormalization of the chromomagnetic operator , </S>",
    "<S> the infrared divergences cancel in the matching , but the ultraviolet behavior in hqet and in the full theory is different because there is a heavy quark mass in the full theory , while there is no scale in the hqet . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , if we use the on - shell wave function renormalization , the wave function renormalization in the full qcd and in the hqet is different . </S>",
    "<S> therefore there appears nontrivial matching condition for the chromomagnetic operator in the hqet . </S>",
    "<S> however , that is not the case in the collinear effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> the difference lies in the fact that we are dealing with massless quarks and gluons both in the full qcd and in the effective theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the effective lagrangian is not renormalized to all orders in @xmath0 and to all orders in @xmath8 due to the reparameterization invariance and the residual energy invariance combined with the collinear and the usoft gauge invariance . </S>",
    "<S> this is a very strong constraint imposed on the collinear effective theory , and it simplifies higher - order corrections in @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the wilson coefficients of various operators at higher order in @xmath8 are the same as those operators at leading order in @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we can save a lot of calculations in evaluating higher - order corrections to matrix elements of some operators , and the renormalization behavior of the wilson coefficients of higher - dimensional operators is related to that of the wilson coefficients of the operators at leading order .    </S>",
    "<S> we have considered the collinear sector which involves collinear quarks , collinear gluons , and usoft gluons in the effective theory . </S>",
    "<S> what we have not considered here is the soft sector and the usoft sector , which have different symmetry structure . </S>",
    "<S> for example , there is no such symmetry as reparameterization invariance in the usoft sector . </S>",
    "<S> the usoft sector can be described rather well by the symmetries of the full qcd . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry structure and power corrections for the currents composed of collinear fields , soft fields and usoft fields will be useful in exclusive and inclusive decays of heavy mesons and other high energy processes . </S>"
