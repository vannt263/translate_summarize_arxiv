    "through their specific properties , transition metal borides became attractive both from scientific and technical point of view .",
    "for instance , yb@xmath1 , like some other rare - earth and actinide hexaborides , shows superconductivity below 7.1  k  @xcite and has been considered as a possible candidate for high - temperature thermoelectric materials  @xcite .",
    "detailed knowledge of the electronic structure of a material is a key ingredient for an in - depth understanding of many of its macroscopic features .",
    "a combination of experimental methods as well as computations on an _ ab - initio _ level has proved very efficient , in particular relating electronic structure calculations to results of nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) technique .",
    "the value of the electric field gradient ( efg ) , measured by nmr quadrupole interaction , is directly determined by the charge distribution around the nucleus .",
    "thus , theoretical efg studies based on the electronic structure are important in order to give a reliable interpretation of the experimental data .",
    "one of the strengths of nmr measurements is that , being a microscopic tool , they are sensitive to the symmetry of the crystallographic sites and in particular to the electron density in the vicinity of the nucleus . in a recent study ,",
    "this sensitivity was used to provide criteria for the determination of crystal structures that are still under debate  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report the efg values for yb@xmath1 and yb@xmath0 and the determination of the knight shifts by using the magic - angle spinning ( mas ) technique .",
    "the experimental efgs are compared and interpreted with the theoretical ones obtained from _ ab - initio _ calculations .",
    "the structure of cubic yb@xmath1 ( space group @xmath16 , no .",
    "221 ) consists of a simple cubic lattice of corner - connected b@xmath1 octahedra with y atoms filling the cubic holes . in this and other borides with the same structure the b ",
    "b distance between neighbouring octahedra is slightly shorter than within the octahedron ( for yb@xmath1 : 1.64    compared to 1.75   ) . in agreement with this crystallographic structure",
    "there is only a single efg value . a previous @xmath2b nmr study for yb@xmath1  @xcite reported the spin - lattice relaxation time and the spectrum .",
    "however , the authors were unable to determine the efg because of the widely broadened satellite lines and the weak nmr signal used in their instrumentation .    on the other hand , tetragonal yb@xmath0 ( space group @xmath17 , no .",
    "127 ) has a quasilayer structure with alternating sheets of y atoms and b@xmath1 octahedra linked together laterally by b@xmath18 units . in this structure five different nearest - neighbour b ",
    "b distances between 1.64    and 1.81    are observed . in yb@xmath0",
    "the boron atoms are situated in three different crystallographic positions with different efgs for each of them , as will be demonstrated in the present paper .",
    "for confirmation of the validity of the available experimental lattice parameters and the atomic positions , calculations have been performed using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp )  @xcite . by this method the kohn ",
    "sham equations of density - functional theory  @xcite with periodic boundary conditions are solved within a plane - wave basis set with electron  ion interactions described by the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method  @xcite . for exchange and correlation the general gradient approximation ( gga )",
    "@xcite was applied .",
    "the structural parameters were calculated by atomic forces and stress - tensor minimization . for each of the",
    "two borides two different energy cutoffs for the plane - wave basis were used ( 400  ev and a cutoff higher by at least a factor of 2 ) , which lead to practically the same results , so that adequate convergence is ensured .",
    "the experimental and calculated structural parameters for yb@xmath0 and yb@xmath1 are given in tables  1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "for cubic yb@xmath1 , where the lattice parameter @xmath19 and the positional parameter of the b atom are the only free parameters , the minimum - energy structure was also found by the full - potential linearized augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) method within the lda approximation which is described in the next section .",
    "the structural parameters optimized by vasp have been used to calculate the efgs for yb@xmath1 and yb@xmath0 .",
    ".experimental and calculated structural parameters for yb@xmath0 adopting the thb@xmath0 structure ( @xmath17 , no .",

    ", < , < \" , ]     [ table6 ]      the knight shifts , @xmath20 , measured for both compounds , are found to be very small , i.  e. , 0.6  ppm and @xmath21  ppm for yb@xmath1 and yb@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the accuracy of the @xmath20 values were estimated to be @xmath22  ppm , where the uncertainty results from an incomplete reduction of the strong dipolar interaction in the mas experiment , mainly between the boron nuclei .",
    "these values of @xmath20 are much smaller than those observed in mgb@xmath18 , where @xmath23  ppm  @xcite and in yni@xmath18b@xmath18c , where @xmath24  ppm  @xcite ( both values are for room temperature ) .",
    "this comparison indicates that the values for the densities of states ( dos ) at the fermi level for the boron sites are much lower than those in the borides mentioned above .",
    "especially the lack of @xmath25-type dos , which is usually the contribution with the largest hyperfine field , reduces significantly the shifts .",
    "indeed , the @xmath25-type dos per boron atom is , in yb@xmath1  @xcite , over 20 times smaller than in mgb@xmath18  @xcite .",
    "also the @xmath26-type dos per b atom is significantly smaller in yb@xmath1 compared to mgb@xmath18 .",
    "these data are compatible with the present electronic band structure calculations ( see next section ) which show that @xmath25- and @xmath26-type boron states are located mainly below the fermi energy and thus the contribution to the dos at the @xmath27 is small .",
    "the first theoretical investigation of metal borides of general formula @xmath28b@xmath1 has been performed fifty years ago by longuet - higgins and roberts  @xcite using the tight - binding approximation . according to these authors the octahedral arrangement of the b atoms leads to ten bonding states which , when filled with the 18 b @xmath25 and @xmath26 plus two metal valence electrons , will correspond to an insulator .",
    "a metal will be obtained when the hexaboride of a trivalent metal is considered instead of a divalent metal . in their paper",
    "the states below the fermi level are not only characterized in terms of their bonding or antibonding properties but also as regards their participation in bonds within a single b@xmath1 octahedron or between neighbouring octahedra .",
    "later  @xcite the higher lying valence and conduction bands of yb@xmath1 have been calculated by a discrete variational method in a non - selfconsistent fashion .",
    "recent electronic - structure calculations for yb@xmath1 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite ( dos only ) and in ref .",
    "@xcite where also the band structure is given . for yb@xmath0",
    "only the dos has been published so far  @xcite . in both references , however , the lowest b @xmath29 band is not shown although it is of crucial importance for the chemical bonding in both borides as will be argued below . in the case of yb@xmath1 shein",
    "@xcite designate it erroneously as `` quasi - core b @xmath29 band ''  obviously mainly because it is a low - lying band . in fig .",
    "2 the band structures for yb@xmath0 and yb@xmath1 are presented .",
    "the dos curves for yb@xmath0 and yb@xmath1 are given in fig .  3 together with the local partial dos components .",
    "for both borides the states at energies of ca .",
    "@xmath30  ev are dominated by b @xmath29 character with a considerable amount of b @xmath31 character .",
    "such states appear for all b atoms constituting the b@xmath1 octahedra , but not for b(2 ) , which belongs to the b@xmath18 unit of which each b atom is linked to two different octahedra . in this energy range",
    "hybride orbitals are formed which lead to strong covalent @xmath32 bonds between the boron atoms within a b@xmath1 unit which can be seen from the corresponding electron densities shown in fig .",
    "after an energy gap of about 3.7  ev a complex of bands appears in both compounds where in the lower energy range b @xmath25 states prevail with an admixture of b @xmath26 states except for the b(2 ) atoms .",
    "these states correspond mainly to bonds between different b@xmath1 octahedra and @xmath25@xmath25 @xmath32 bonds in the b@xmath18 units of yb@xmath0 . at higher energies below the fermi level",
    "b @xmath26 states are predominant apart from a relatively small b @xmath25 and a considerable y @xmath33 contribution .",
    "also in this energy range the interoctahedral bonds are dominant except for the region very near the fermi level in yb@xmath1 where the intraoctahedral b ",
    "b bonds again become important .    in yb@xmath1 the y @xmath33 states",
    "have mostly @xmath34 character which can be seen from the valence electron densities in fig .  5 .",
    "this figure also shows that this is not the case for yb@xmath0 although near the fermi level @xmath34-like character , i.  e. , @xmath35 character , is predominant .",
    "our results for yb@xmath1 are in very good agreement with the detailed semiempirical tight - binding investigation by longuett - higgins and roberts  @xcite . in order to make the comparison we performed crystal - field splittings for the b @xmath26 ( and y @xmath33 )",
    "we thus obtained the distinction between their radial ( @xmath36 ) and tangential orbitals ( @xmath37 ) . together with electron - density plots for certain energy ranges , the regions for the different site orbitals for the b@xmath1 octahedron could be identified .",
    "we obtained the following order ( increasing energy ) : @xmath38 ( band at ca .",
    "@xmath30  ev ) , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "( the nomenclature is taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and refers to the irreducible representations for the whole octahedron . )    in fig .",
    "6 the valence electron densities in the ( 001 ) plane through the b atoms in yb@xmath0 and yb@xmath1 is displayed .",
    "apart from the structural differences between both borides ( irregular heptagonal arrangement of the b atoms outside the octahedra in yb@xmath0 compared to an almost regular octagon in yb@xmath1 ) the slightly higher valence electron densities between the b atoms outside the octahedra in both compounds can be seen as well as the deep density minima which designate the much weaker covalent y ",
    "y bonds perpendicular to the ( 001 ) plane .",
    "for yb@xmath0 and yb@xmath1 we have performed electric - field gradient and knight shift measurements for the b sites .",
    "the aim of the paper has been a comparison of the nmr results and the available structural data with the results of accurate first - principles calculations .",
    "we have therefore optimized the structures by atomic forces and stress - tensor minimization . for the optimized structures efg calculations have been performed .",
    "perfect agreement was found between the experimental and calculated structural parameters and electric - field gradients thus confirming the structure models available in the literature .",
    "based on calculated total and local partial dos as well as electron - density plots , we analyse the bonding situation in both compounds and conclude that the lowest valence bands are of particular importance for the stabilty of both yttrium borides .    the authors would like to thank p. vajda for stimulating discussions and the austrian science foundation ( project no .  ) for financial support .",
