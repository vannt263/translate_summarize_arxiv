    "the present paper is part of a program aimed at finding a method for the automatic computation of metric measures , such as the packing or hausdorff measure , of a given fractal set . in particular",
    ", we obtain the rates of convergence of the algorithms given in @xcite and @xcite for computing the centered hausdorff and packing measures , respectively , of a totally disconnected self - similar set .",
    "it is important to note that , although the convergence of these algorithms was shown in @xcite and @xcite without establishing their rates of convergence , the outputs of the algorithms were still useful for obtaining conjectural values of the measures . using results presented in this note we can prove these conjectures ( see sections [ packex ] and [ hcex ] ) .",
    "recall that a totally disconnected self - similar set associated to a system @xmath0 of contracting similitudes of @xmath1 is a compact non - empty set @xmath2 @xmath3  such that @xmath4 and satisfying    @xmath5    the last condition implies the _ open set condition ( osc , see [ hutch ] ) _ , and it is known as the _ strong separation condition ( ssc)_. throughout the paper we assume the system @xmath6 satisfies the _ ssc _ and write @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the distance between @xmath9  and @xmath10 .",
    "the _ similarity ratio _ of @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath12 , and we write @xmath13    both algorithms are based on the self - similar tiling principle stated in @xcite for self - similar sets satisfying the osc . in @xcite it was shown that if @xmath14 is any closed subset ( or tile ) of a self - similar set @xmath2 such that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the invariant measure ( see ) , then @xmath2 can be tiled , without any loss of @xmath16-measure , by a countable collection of tiles that are images of @xmath14 under similitudes .",
    "recall from @xcite that , for self - similar sets satisfying the osc , the measure @xmath17 is a multiple of any scaling measure , and in particular of the packing , hausdorff , or centered hausdorff measure .",
    "taking an appropriate initial tile @xmath14 ( one with minimal spherical density in the case of the packing measure , and with maximal spherical density in the case of the hausdorff measure ; see remark [ rough idea ] ) we obtain both an optimal packing or covering @xcite , and the exact value of the corresponding measure .",
    "our method requires a particular form of the separation condition , the ssc , in order to make the computation of the metric measures feasible ( see section [ conclusions ] for a discussion of the computability of metric measures satisfying the osc ) .",
    "metric measures suitable for studying the size of sets of lebesgue measure zero in @xmath18 , such as the hausdorff , packing , and centered hausdorff measure ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively ) have been studied intensively in recent years .",
    "however , the challenging problem of finding systematic methods for computing the values of these measures for a general fractal set remains open .",
    "much effort has been made in this direction , and exact values and bounds for the measures of some fractal sets are known already ( see @xcite-@xcite , @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein ) .    in this direction , the algorithms presented in @xcite and [ llm4 ] can be seen as the first steps towards the systematic computation of the centered hausdorff and packing measures of a self - similar set . these algorithms yield estimates of the corresponding measures for a wide class of self - similar sets , taking as input the list of contracting similitudes associated with the given set .",
    "it is important to note that in some cases , such as for the class of sierpinski gaskets with dimension less than or equal to one , the packing measure algorithm has been useful not only for estimating the value of @xmath20 on each particular set in the class , but also for finding a formula for the packing measure of an arbitrary member of the class . as shown in (",
    "* theorem  2 ) , the information provided by the algorithm can then be used to prove the formula . however , in many other cases , such as for some plane self - similar sets of dimension greater than one , the absence of the corresponding formula means that it is desirable to know the accuracy of the numerical results obtained from the algorithms . in @xcite",
    "the centered hausdorff measure algorithm was implemented for some sets whose centered hausdorff measures were available in the literature and some other sets whose centered hausdorff measures were still unknown .",
    "it is remarkable that , in the first case , the optimal values were attained at early iterations and , in the second case , the algorithm yielded conjectural values that could be proved with the methods developed in @xcite .",
    "however , the rate of convergence of neither algorithm was known .",
    "this is the problem we solve in this paper and the content of the next two main theorems .",
    "[ main]suppose that the system @xmath22 satisfies the ssc . then , for every @xmath23 * *  * * such that * *  * * @xmath24 * *  * * and every @xmath25 as in there holds *  * @xmath26 where@xmath27 @xmath28 , @xmath29 is such that @xmath30 , and @xmath31    [ mainc]suppose that the system @xmath22 satisfies the ssc",

    "one of the most important features of theorems  [ main ] and [ mainc ] is that they provide sharp bounds for the exact values of the corresponding measures .",
    "moreover , these bounds yield automatically estimates of the corresponding measures , accurate in some cases to as many as @xmath40 decimal places . in the difficult case of self - similar sets having dimensions greater than one , for which less is known ,",
    "we give examples with five decimal place accuracy .",
    "for instance , applying theorem  [ main ] to the family of sierpinski gaskets @xmath41 with @xmath42 ( see for a definition ) , yields @xmath43 ( see table  [ times ] ) and @xmath44 .",
    "we also get @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the plane cantor set of dimension @xmath47 . to our knowledge none of these estimates",
    "were previously known .    however , the most important consequence of the combination of theorems  main and [ mainc ] with the algorithms given in @xcite and [ llm4 ] is that it automatically provides an approximation to the value of the measure of any self - similar set satisfying the ssc .",
    "we remark that the precision of the results depends on the size of the contraction ratios .",
    "namely , the accuracy achieved improves as the contraction ratios decrease ( see @xcite , @xcite and section  [ conclusions ] below for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "in particular , the examples given in sections  packex and [ hcex ] show that the algorithms accurately recover the known values of these measures for sets with dimension less than one .",
    "moreover , the results presented in this article serve to rule out certain potential formulas for some classes of self - similar sets .",
    "the paper is divided into two main sections , one devoted to the packing measure and the other to the centered hausdorff measure . in each case",
    ", we first recall the relevant algorithm from @xcite or @xcite , although in the case of the centered hausdorff measure we give some improvements to the algorithm .",
    "this is done in sections  [ recallpack]and [ recallch ] .",
    "then , we prove theorems  [ main ] and [ mainc ] at the ends of sections [ ratepac ] and [ ratehc ] , respectively .",
    "it is remarkable that these proofs do not use the convergence of the corresponding algorithms , so the present note provides shorter alternative proofs of their convergence .",
    "finally , sections [ packex ] and [ hcex ]  are devoted to analyzing the results obtained by applying theorems  [ main ] and mainc to the examples given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these numerical experiments have a twofold purpose .",
    "on the one hand they illustrate the theoretical results , showing how the algorithms perform in practice . on the other hand they offer quite complete information ,",
    "previously unavailable in the literature , on the exact values of the packing and centered hausdorff measures of the self - similar sets in three of the most classic families of self - similar sets , namely , the central cantor sets in the line , the sierpinski gaskets , and the cantor sets in the unit square .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] we discuss the computability of metric measures on self - similar sets in view of the results obtained in this paper .",
    "we denote the open and closed ball with center @xmath48 and radius @xmath49 by @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "we use the notation @xmath52 for the boundary of @xmath53 . given @xmath54 , we write @xmath55 for the diameter of @xmath56 and @xmath57 for the complement of @xmath56 .",
    "we write @xmath58 for the _ similarity dimension _ of @xmath2 , i.e. , the unique solution @xmath58 of @xmath59 .",
    "sometimes we will refer to @xmath58 as the hausdorff dimension , @xmath38 , of @xmath2 , since the similarity and hausdorff dimension coincide when @xmath2 is a totally disconnected self - similar set , as in the present note .    for the code space we use the following notation .",

    "furthermore , these estimates give valuable additional information about the behavior of @xmath16 . for",

    "the _ packing measure _ of a compact set @xmath56 with finite packing premeasure can be defined by @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a set function nondecreasing with respect to @xmath83 and the supremum is taken over all countable collections of disjoint euclidean balls centered in @xmath56 and having diameters smaller than @xmath83 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recall that , as explained in @xcite-@xcite , a two - stage definition is needed for general euclidean sets .",
    "in the specific case of self - similar sets much effort has been made to find a simplified definition of @xmath20 suitable for computation .",
    "in @xcite it was shown how the above one - stage definition allows a characterization of @xmath20 in terms of density functions which later facilitated tackling the computability problem algorithmically ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "next , we see that this characterization is also central for proving the rate of convergence of the packing measure algorithm given by theorem  [ main ] .",

    "the general method for the computation of metric measures was established in that paper , and a discussion on the computability of the existing metric measures was initiated . in the introduction of that paper one can read :    `` the exhaustive class of coverings used by this ( the hausdorff ) measure gives it a special place as the smallest among all measures based on coverings .",
    "the price to be paid for such privilege is that the research on the exact hausdorff measure of a self - similar set leads , with few exceptions , to the computation of bounds , but the exact hausdorff measure of a self - similar set will remain unknown for some time . ''",
    "`` another consequence of these results is that the packing measure could be easier than the hausdorff measure from a computational point of view . .",
    "since the search for sets of optimal density is restricted to balls centered at @xmath2 . ''",
    "these predictions have been confirmed in the subsequent literature gathered in the bibliographical references below .",
    "some results , already discussed earlier , on the exact packing and centered hausdorff measures have been obtained using geometric methods , but the list of known results on hausdorff measure has not grown significantly . the predictions in @xcite have also been confirmed by the work on the computability of metric measures reported in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and , in particular , by the results in the present paper , that permit a more detailed discussion of the frontiers of the computability of metric measures .",
    "furthermore , something new can be added to the early expectations : by results in @xcite , @xcite , and the present paper , the centered hausdorff measure and the packing measure can be added to the list of `` computable '' metric measures .",
    "this is fortunate , since a covering and a packing based measure are available for computation , at least for self - similar sets satisfying the ssc . as pointed out in remark  [ rough idea ] , this also gives additional valuable information on the spectrum of densities of @xmath80 .",
    "the above conclusions motivate a call to revisit well - established folklore on the topic of metric measures . because of the double step definitions required for the packing and centered hausdorff measures , it is a common opinion that these measures are too awkward to handle .",
    "however , in the setting of self - similar sets satisfying the osc ( and so also the ssc ) , the second step in the definitions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be omitted ( and , in the case of the packing measure , it can be omitted also in the more general setting of compact sets with finite packing measure ) .",
    "as shown in the present paper , one can take advantage of this fact for computational purposes , and it is now clear that the measures @xmath20 and @xmath21 will play a relevant role in the future , at least in computational issues .",
    "we now discuss the frontiers of the computability of metric measures . at the present ,",
    "two metric measures , @xmath21 and @xmath20 , can be computed with the accuracy necessary for potential technical applications only in the case of self - similar sets satisfying the ssc and having small contraction ratios . in these cases ,",
    "if the contraction ratios are small enough the results in this paper indicate that an optimal ball might exist , and a formula giving the exact value of the corresponding metric measure might be found by theoretical methods",
    ". moreover , our algorithm is an efficient tool for identifying what might be the optimal ball , if the algorithm stabilizes at an early iteration . on the other hand ,",
    "if the contraction ratios are large , then any attempted theoretical approach could be doomed to failure , since the problem of the calculation of @xmath21 and @xmath20 is essentially computational .    the bounds on the maximum error provided by theorems  [ main ] and mainc decrease exponentially with the number @xmath69 of iterations , but the number of calculations grows at a much faster rate when @xmath69 increases , since the number of feasible balls depends on the square of the number of points in @xmath112 , and this in turn grows exponentially with @xmath69 .",
    "in this regard , the reductions , obtained in @xcite and @xcite , of the families of balls that need to be considered are crucial . however , if the contraction radii increase , two things occur that can render accurate computation of @xmath261 and @xmath21 impossible .",
    "first it is necessary to use smaller balls , since the minimum separation distance @xmath262 between the basic cylinders decreases , so the number of balls to be explored increases .",
    "second and more important , in order to obtain good estimates of the @xmath80-measure of a ball , it is necessary to go to an iteration @xmath69 for which the size of the cylinders of the @xmath69th generation is small relative to the size of the ball , and for this purpose we have to go to more advanced iterations for balls of small size . on the other hand ,",
    "if the contraction ratios are large , @xmath69 must be taken to be still larger , so that the @xmath69-cylinders will be sufficiently small . in this case the computability of @xmath20 and @xmath21 encounters severe obstacles ( see remark  [ timeq ] ) .",
    "although the theoretical methods proposed in @xcite can , in principle , be applied to self - similar sets satisfying the osc , these cases are not yet amenable to computation by our method .",
    "this is because the osc can be viewed as a limiting case , with the size of feasible balls going to zero ( see [ ay ] for an example in the line with the osc , where the exploration of arbitrarily small balls must be undertaken in the search for a ball with maximal density ) and the argument given above for cases satisfying the ssc and having large contraction ratios applies in an extreme form .",
    "the computation of the spherical hausdorff measure @xmath263 could still be feasible for the easier cases of small contraction ratios , but the results will be much poorer than those for @xmath20 or @xmath21 for increasing contraction ratios , because the class of balls centered at arbitrary points in the ambient space , which is the covering class used in the definition of @xmath264 , is a much larger class than the covering classes used in the definitions of @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the computation of the hausdorff measure is still unreachable by the argument given in @xcite .",

    "<S> in this paper we obtain the rates of convergence of the algorithms given in @xcite and @xcite for an automatic computation of the centered hausdorff and packing measures of a totally disconnected self - similar set . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate these rates empirically through the numerical analysis of three standard classes of self - similar sets , namely , the families of cantor type sets in the real line and the plane and the class of sierpinski gaskets . </S>",
    "<S> for these three classes and for small contraction ratios , sharp bounds for the exact values of the corresponding measures are obtained and it is shown how these bounds automatically yield estimates of the corresponding measures , accurate in some cases to as many as 14 decimal places . in particular , the algorithms accurately recover the exact values of the measures in all cases in which these values are known by geometrical arguments . </S>",
    "<S> positive results , which confirm some conjectural values given in @xcite and @xcite for the measures , are also obtained for an intermediate range of larger contraction ratios . </S>",
    "<S> we give an argument showing that , for this range of contraction ratios , the problem is inherently computational in the sense that any theoretical proof , such as those mentioned above , might be impossible , so that in these cases , our method is the only available approach . for contraction ratios close to those of the connected case our computational method becomes intractably time consuming , so the computation of the exact values of the packing and centered hausdorff measures in the general case , with the open set condition , remains a challenging problem . </S>"
