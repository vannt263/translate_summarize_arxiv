    "interferometric imaging is a common method to investigate phase objects ( see for instance @xcite and ref . therein ) .",
    "sound waves are examples of such objects . compared to other imaging methods such as schlieren imaging",
    "( see for instance @xcite ) , or stress induced birefringence imaging@xcite , interferometric imaging has the advantage of providing directly quantitative measurements .",
    "refractive index maps can be computed from those measurements , and in the case of a sound wave , acoustic pressure can be determined .",
    "there are two methods to reconstruct phase maps from recorded interferograms .",
    "fringe analysis @xcite has the advantage of requiring only one image ( or two if fringe shift is used ) , but implies a reduced spatial resolution and phase ambiguities . in multiphase ( or phase shifting ) interferometry , the map of the optical phase is extracted from several images taken while changing the phase of the reference beam . applying this method to time dependent",
    "phenomena requires special adaptations to circumvent the slow acquisition rate of common cameras .",
    "when the phenomenon is a steady sinusoidal oscillation with sufficient amplitude , information can be extracted from time averaged images@xcite .",
    "this is the case for the popular tv holography method@xcite .",
    "for fast transient phenomena , a time sampling is to be made by using pulsed light sources to get images of the object at particular times .",
    "these quasi - instantaneous images registered by the ccd camera are read on much longer times .",
    "recording the complete evolution is possible for repetitive transient phenomena by varying the delay between the laser pulse and the triggered phenomenon .",
    "depending on the time scale of the phenomenon under study , pulsed light sources such as pulsed led@xcite , q - switched lasers@xcite , or even femtosecond laser@xcite have been used .    regarding multiphase interferometric imaging for fast transient phenomena",
    ", the litterature provides very few examples .",
    "fringe analysis with tilted reference wavefronts seems to be the widely used method , with the drawbacks mentionned previously .",
    "it is thus of interest to investigate whether pulsed multiphase interferometry can provide phase maps , or phase shift maps , for fast transient phase objects . in this article",
    ", it is shown that this method can indeed be used in such cases , and provides accurate images with little sensitivity to optical defects .",
    "the price to be paid is a longer acquisition process . as an example",
    ", a 1  mhz ultrasound pulse produced in water by an hemispherical transducer is imaged . in section  2 , the experimental arrangement",
    "is described as well as the procedure to record several images with different reference phases , at various time delays . in section  3 ,",
    "the corresponding data processing is detailed .",
    "the phase maps are extracted , and unwrapped if phase shifts exceed @xmath1 .",
    "then an inverse abel transformation is applied to recover the local index of refraction , and hence the sound pressure .",
    "the result is shown in section  5 and discussed in section  6 .",
    "the experimental setup is sketched in figure 1 .",
    "it is based on a jamin interferometer@xcite with a frequency doubled pulsed nd : yag laser as a light source . the jamin interferometer was chosen because of its simplicity and intrinsic stability . when separated , the two interfering beams are close to each other and undergo similar disturbances from air turbulence and encountered windows@xcite . in the sample region ,",
    "the two beams are 6  mm apart and are 6  mm high .",
    "the lens @xmath2 images the entrance rectangular diaphragm @xmath3 on the sample , while @xmath4 makes an image of the sample onto the ccd camera .",
    "the laser ( big sky laser cfr200 ) delivers 120  mj , 8  ns long pulses with a repetition rate of 20  hz , from which only about 1  @xmath5j pulses are derived by 4 vitrous reflections , and a @xmath6 gray filter .",
    "the optical wavelength used is @xmath7  nm . the laser is transversally highly multimode with a flat top profile .",
    "its effective coherence length , as measured with the interferometer by the fringe contrast versus the optical path difference , was found to be 4  mm at half contrast .",
    "hence the optical path difference between the two beams was kept well below this value to get a good contrast .",
    "the imaging camera ( andor luca  r ) is triggered synchronously with the pulsed laser . used with a @xmath8 binning , it provides @xmath9 pixel images of the @xmath10 mm@xmath11 observed region .",
    "image resolution is discussed at the end of this section and is of about 20  @xmath5 m .    for scanning the interferometer , two 4  mm thick parallel plates",
    "@xmath12 are introduced in the reference beam , with symmetrical tilts to avoid beam displacement ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . they are allowed to rotate around an horizontal axis so that their tilt angle can be precisely controlled around 5@xmath13 .",
    "this is achieved by moving a separator along the vertical axis . when changing its heigth @xmath14 by @xmath15  mm , the tilt angle is changed by @xmath16 , and the optical path by @xmath17  @xmath5 m .",
    "because of their thickness , the plates @xmath12 also introduce a difference of about 4  mm in the optical length of the two interferometer paths . in order to keep the optical path difference smaller than the laser coherence length ,",
    "a second pair of similar plates @xmath18 is introduced in the signal beam .",
    "those are kept fixed . the phase shift between the two beams introduced by these devices is approximated as : @xmath19 where @xmath20  mm and @xmath21 as determined by simple geometrical optics .",
    "in fact the two parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 depend somewhat on the incidence angle of the beams on the plates , which can not be measured easily .",
    "so they are left as fitting parameters as explained later .",
    "the phase object to be imaged is an ultrasound wave pulse ( central frequency 1.06 mhz , duration 5  @xmath5s ) emitted in water along the vertical axis by a piezoelectric hemisphere ( inner diameter 12  mm , outer diameter 16  mm , provided by channel industries inc . ) .",
    "water used was filtered by reverse osmosis ( millipore direct - q ultrapure water system ) .",
    "the thickness vibration mode of the transducer is driven by an rf amplifier ( rf in fig .",
    "1 ) fed with a function generator ( tektronix afg3022 ) triggered from the laser command electronics with an adjustable delay .",
    "the same generator also triggers image acquisition by the camera .",
    "the sound velocity in water is 1480  m / s @xcite at @xmath24  k. the sound wavelength is @xmath25  mm and the sound pulse length about @xmath26  mm .",
    "the sound pulse time of flight from the transducer inner surface to its center is about 4  @xmath5s . in the experiment trigger",
    "is given by the laser flash firing .",
    "the laser pulse takes place 170  @xmath5s later with a negligible jitter .",
    "the sound pulse is sent at time @xmath27 varied from 157 to 169  @xmath5s by steps of 0.01  @xmath5s ( @xmath28 time steps ) . for each time step ,",
    "images are taken for @xmath29 different values of @xmath14 , labeled @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath31 , labeled @xmath32 , span an interval set to @xmath33 .",
    "raw data are a set of @xmath34 images labelled with their time delay and phase step .",
    "their recording takes about @xmath35 minutes . for each phase step , a reference image is first made by averaging @xmath36 images without exciting the transducer .",
    "these images of an undisturbed medium are later used as reference images for subtraction of a background phase field .",
    "the order in which @xmath14 and @xmath27 are varied is important to minimize interferometer drift effects .",
    "the sound pulse insertion time @xmath27 is varied first at a fixed phase step along a complete time series , before changing @xmath14 to the next phase step .",
    "during data processing , pixels are treated independently .",
    "hence there is no spatial resolution loss due to image processing .",
    "let @xmath37 be the intensity recorded for a given pixel for the time index @xmath27 and interferometer phase index @xmath38 .",
    "it is expected that @xcite : @xmath39\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the average intensity , @xmath41 the fringe contrast , @xmath42 the optical phase to be measured for this particular pixel and @xmath43 is the interferometer phase given by equation ( [ psi ] ) for each value of @xmath14 . to extract @xmath42 , one needs to fit the @xmath44 values @xmath37 with equation ( [ interf ] ) with five unknown parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath45 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 . because of the nonlinear term @xmath46 in equation ( [ psi ] ) ,",
    "this involves a time consuming nonlinear fitting procedure .",
    "actually the parameters @xmath47 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 do not depend much on time and position .",
    "thus they are only computed for pixels of the reference images for which @xmath42 is zero .",
    "actually the variance of @xmath22 is a few percent .",
    "hence , only a mean value over space of those three parameters is computed and used in the next steps of the process . in the later images",
    "only three parameters are to be determined for each pixel , namely @xmath40 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "this can be done with a fast linear method @xcite and takes about 1  s for the entire image of one time step .",
    "the value @xmath42 determined in this way is within the limits @xmath50 , @xmath51 and undergoes possibly @xmath52 phase jumps .",
    "the first time step is chosen so that the phase shift amplitude introduced by the sound field is less than @xmath51 .",
    "the phase unwrapping is realized in time for each pixel by removing phase jumps @xmath53 larger than @xmath51 .",
    "this is possible only if time steps verify the sampling condition , i.e. @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the phase noise .",
    "this condition actually sets the value of the time step and consequently the number of steps in the experiment .",
    "usually phase unwrapping is made spatially for each time on the 2d - maps , and then made continuous in time .",
    "although many algorithms have been published on this topic@xcite , it is not a trivial problem .",
    "unwrapping the phase in time for each pixel separately is much easier and faster .",
    "the continuity in space for the phase shift map @xmath56 is obtained automatically , because it starts from 0 everywhere and has no later phase jumps .",
    "the phase @xmath57 is assumed to be related to the refractive index by a simple integration along the @xmath58-axis parallel to the beam direction in the sample ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "more precisely , for each pixel @xmath59 , one takes into account the difference @xmath60 between the perturbed index @xmath61 seen by the signal beam at point @xmath62 and the refractive index @xmath63 of the unperturbed fluid seen by the reference beam on its parallel path . in our case",
    "the sound field is rotationnally invariant around the hemisphere axis @xmath64 so that @xmath65 is a function of @xmath64 and @xmath66 only .",
    "then the phase map results from an integration of the refractive index variations over the path of the beam from the entrance window ( @xmath67 ) , to the exit window ( @xmath68 ) : @xmath69 note however that @xmath65 is identically @xmath70 after some finite distance from the center ( dashed circle on figure 2 ) because there is still no sound there . hence equation ( [ phase ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath71 which is the abel transform of the @xmath72 map . conversely radial refractive index profiles can be retrieved from phase maps via an inverse abel tranform . to make that part easier , the camera lines and the signal light beam direction @xmath73",
    "have been carefully aligned parallel to the hemisphere basis .",
    "the abscissa @xmath74 of the hemisphere axis is determined as the symmetry axis of the projected sound field .",
    "then the abel inversion of the phase is perfomed for each line @xmath64 on @xmath75 using the algorithm proposed by @xcite .",
    "the data are fitted with splines over successive sets of 20 pixels .",
    "abel inversion procedure is justified provided that light rays do not suffer any significant deviation during their propagation through the studied sample .",
    "more precisely the raman - nath condition should be fulfilled , i.e. deviation of a light beam from a straight line over the sample diameter @xmath76 due to the refractive index gradient should be less than the optical resolution @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the sound wavelength , @xmath79 the laser light wavelength , @xmath80 the maximum phase accumulated across the sample .",
    "then the condition amounts to : @xmath81 with the values @xmath82",
    "@xmath5 m , @xmath83  mm , @xmath84 , condition ( [ ramannath ] ) puts a rather large limit on @xmath80 , about 50 .",
    "a second condition is that all rays collected by the imaging optics and originating from a given point of the object undergo the same @xmath57 retardation .",
    "maximum transverse extension of such a ray bundle at the exit of the sample , i.e. at @xmath85 , should be less than the characteristic length over which @xmath57 varies , typically @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath86 is the aperture angle of the optics , this is true if @xmath87 . in our case",
    ", @xmath88  mm . this leads to the condition @xmath89 .",
    "the numerical aperture of the imaging lens is about @xmath90 and fulfills the condition . in other respects ,",
    "this numerical aperture should be large enough to ensure the desired optical resolution @xmath77 .",
    "the current aperture provides a resolution @xmath91 m .",
    "the acoustic pressure field is proportional to @xmath65 and is computed from the relation : @xmath92 where the water piezo - optic constant is @xmath93mpa@xmath94@xcite .",
    "in figures 3 and 4 , three stages are shown from interference images to pressure map when the sound pressure is at its maximum at the focus . on image 3.a ,",
    "severe optical defects are clearly visible : dust particles , diffraction by the hemisphere rim .",
    "these defects are nearly completely washed out in the phase map 3.b . on the contrary , they could be seen obviously on the contrast map .",
    "this appears to be the main advantage of the multiphase method , the fitted phase being only weakly sensitive to intensity fluctuations .",
    "the signal to noise is good enough to yield an acceptable inverse abel transform , from which the pressure is deduced using equation [ pression ] .",
    "its radial profile is shown in figure 4.a , as well as its time variation at the focus when the sound pulse is going through ( figure 4.b ) .",
    "while the tranducer is excited at its resonance frequency by a constant amplitude sinusoidal burst of 5 periods , its response increases in time as expected from a driven damped harmonic oscillator .",
    "the oscillation is actively damped during the last oscillation .",
    "this explains the time profile of the sound pulse ( figure 4.b ) .",
    "this imaging method thus provides a way to investigate in detail the focusing properties of this type of transducer .",
    "discussions of errors in multiphase interferometry may be found in @xcite .",
    "although written for static interferometric imaging , they apply equally well to the pulsed case .",
    "they show that the multiphase technique brings two benefits .",
    "the first one is to avoid systematic errors coming from imperfectly scanned phase @xmath95 when predetermined schemes such as @xmath96 , @xmath97 or @xmath98 are used @xcite . here the phase is not scanned with an _ a priori _ scheme . its value is extracted from the series of unperturbed images at @xmath99 . in equation ( [ psi ] )",
    "the slope @xmath100 of the actual phase as a function of the scanning parameter @xmath14 is left free , and a non linearity @xmath23 is permitted by the fitting process .",
    "hence the only remaining errors may come from drifts in time of the interferometer . since in the experiment , changing the delay",
    "is ten time faster than changing the phase , images are taken for a complete time series at a fixed reference phase .",
    "this takes about 60  s. then the reference phase is changed to the next value . in this way",
    "a possible drift in time of the interferometer geometry is in some way taken into account by the fitting process of @xmath22 and @xmath23 in formula ( [ psi ] ) .",
    "this scanning procedure , i.e. time first , phase second , is thus to be preferred .",
    "the second benefit from multiphase technique results simply from the larger number of data ( here 25 images compare to a minimum of 3 to extract the phase , and compared to 1 for fringe analysis ) .",
    "this statistical improvement is thus @xmath101 and @xmath102 respectively .",
    "more quantitatively , let @xmath103 be the pixel noise for one image ( including laser fluctuations and detection noise ) : @xmath104 here @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "this gives @xmath108 , or @xmath109 in a more commonly used unit .",
    "of course , the imaging technique has two well - known advantages compared to in situ point by point pressure measurement with a pressure probe .",
    "it provides parallel measurements at a large number of locations and times .",
    "this quality is reflected obviously by the large size of the generated data ( gbytes ) .",
    "it also provides this information in a non invasive and non perturbative way .",
    "nevertheless one may question the accuracy of the pressure field determined in this way .",
    "a quantitative analysis of the errors is not easy , in particular due to the lateral averaging brought by the diffraction on formula ( [ phase ] ) . also the phase field is not always determined up to a region where @xmath110 , inducing some error in the inverse abel transform",
    "thus , to check the accuracy , a direct comparison was made with a fiber - optic probe hydrophone for the pressure at the focus .",
    "a fiber - optic probe hydrophone @xcite determines the liquid refractive index modulation , by measuring the reflection coefficient @xmath111 at the tip of an optical fiber .",
    "reflection coefficient @xmath111 is given by the fresnel formula : @xmath112 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath113 , @xmath114 are the optical fiber and water refractive indices .",
    "water refractive index modulations @xmath115 due to sound waves are retrieved from those of @xmath111 , after averaging over typically @xmath116  bursts .",
    "corrections due to the non zero compressibility of the fiber core are taken into account by : @xmath117 the derivatives of refractive indices with respect to pressure are @xmath118  mpa@xmath94 @xcite and @xmath119  mpa@xmath94 @xcite .",
    "the correction amounts to about @xmath120  % .    the physical quantity probed by the fiber - optic probe hydrophone and the interferometer being the same , a direct comparison can be made @xcite .",
    "the fiber tip was set @xmath121  mm above the piezo hemisphere center .",
    "this position was determined accurately by the images acquired during the measurement .",
    "refractive index variations at the same point were also computed from interferometric measurements , taken with the hydrophone removed .",
    "results are presented in figure 5 .",
    "both measurements are compatible within 5  % .",
    "this is to be compared to the reproductibility of the hydrophone measurements ( typically 10  % ) , and the uncertainties in the inverse abel transform due to the incomplete phase maps ( which can amount to 5  % ) .",
    "hence the agreement is satisfactory .",
    "it appears that multiphase interferometric imaging can be easily applied to repetitive fast transient phenomena for which optical phase is a good observable .",
    "it provides quickly extensive data compared to point by point measurements .",
    "we have shown in the case of a sound wave that these data are quantitatively reliable .",
    "the multiphase feature brings a better immunity to optical defects in the images and an improved signal to noise ratio .",
    "phase unwrapping in time appears as a very simple and robust algorithm .",
    "the longer acquisition time was found acceptable .",
    "hence this method could be more widely used than it has been up to now to study fast transient phenomena .",
