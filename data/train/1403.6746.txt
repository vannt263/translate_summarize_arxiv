    "such a feature is unexpected because the more the universe expands , the more classical it is supposed to become , with quantum corrections playing smaller and smaller roles .",
    "however , with long evolution involved , small quantum effects could potentially add up and eventually drive the universe into collapse even in semiclassical regimes .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the outcome depends on what semiclassical quantum state is realized and how its fluctuations of different variables change in time . to test the proposed scenario",
    ", one needs information about dynamical semiclassical states over long evolution times , an issue that requires good control on quantum evolution and , when addressed with effective equations , a systematic scheme of going beyond the leading classical order .",
    "the effective equations used in @xcite ( as well as @xcite ) were an extension of the classical limit obtained from methods provided in @xcite .",
    "this scheme of going beyond classical order , however , is not entirely systematic because assumptions about the evolving state must be made ; they have not been self - consistently derived within the scheme .",
    "for this reason , the suggested collapse remained a possibility but could not be demonstrated firmly .",
    "( note that going to the other extreme , the high densities of the big bang , requires even better control of evolving states no longer required to be semiclassical .",

    "this behavior may , however , change when the model is quantized with a different choice of factor ordering .",

    "these variations imply quantum back - reaction , which , thanks to the proximity to a harmonic model , should not be large but could still be significant after long evolution . in this paper , we explore the possibility of such a term in the modified friedmann equation found by embarking on a systematic method of deriving effective equations , including the underlying properties of dynamical semiclassical states @xcite . by way of the example of collapse solutions",

    "we will provide a general parameterization of these ambiguities in an expansion of the quantum - corrected hamiltonian constraint by powers of @xmath20 , which turn out to require inverse negative powers as well .",
    "these methods will require a shift in viewpoint , focusing on the form of the last term in ( [ ym friedmann ] ) instead of the possibility of a recollapse which is difficult to assess in an expansion with negative powers of @xmath20 .",
    "this fact highlights how subtle the semiclassical limit of quantum cosmology can be . in particular , it is not clear whether ( loop ) quantum cosmology has the standard semiclassical behavior even in isotropic models .",

    "( an exception is given by semiclassical regimes , where effective methods allow one to change time by gauge transformations of moments @xcite . ) if independence of one s choice of internal time can be achieved at all , as some kind of space - time anomaly freedom , it likely requires detailed prescriptions of factor orderings and other quantization ambiguities .",
    "the hamiltonian one may choose in a deparameterizable version in rather simple terms may not be what is required for the correct physics .",

    "thus , while we see collapse in figure  [ nucollapsehneg1 ] , it coincides with a breakdown of our assumptions in the regime where @xmath60 becomes exponentially small : a regime where higher inverse powers of curvature can become important , even when paired with inverse - volume terms .",

    "we have implemented such an analysis to study the question of whether quantum effects in long - term semiclassical evolution could lead to significant departures from classical behavior , for instance a recollapse of spatially flat isotropic models .",

    "in particular , it does not appear possible to have quantum corrections of the modified friedmann equation independent of the energy density in this formulation .",
    "thus , quantum collapse at low energy densities or large scales does not seem feasible by this mechanism given our corrections and assumptions .",
    "the only possibility , according to our analysis , would be to have inverse - triad corrections with a function @xmath107 increasing more strongly than linearly , but this is not acceptable by the classical limit of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "furthermore , we explored the effects of factor ordering choices at first semiclassical order .",
    "a general tractable parameterization of quantization ambiguities in this regime surprisingly turns out to require a second expansion by the inverse hubble parameter .",
    "although the solutions to these effective equations hint at the possibility of a recollapse , the expansion by the inverse hubble parameter breaks down before a recollapse could be reached .",
    "interestingly , also some relative fluctuations grow too large to satisfy our approximations for all @xmath42 of interest .",
    "extending such an analysis to higher quantum moments could be fruitful ; for instance , unlimited semiclassical evolution may be possible within our expansion scheme if there are corrections to @xmath286 such that it does not asymptotically approach zero , thus preventing factor ordering terms @xmath248 to approach infinity .",
