    "the global attractor of a dynamical system is the unique compact invariant set that attracts the trajectories starting in any bounded set at a uniform rate",
    ". introduced by billotti & lasalle @xcite , they have been the subject of much research since the mid-1980s , and form the central topic of a number of monographs , including babin & vishik @xcite , hale @xcite , ladyzhenskaya @xcite , robinson @xcite , and temam @xcite .",
    "the standard theory incorporates existence results @xcite , upper semicontinuity @xcite , and bounds on the attractor dimension @xcite .",
    "global attractors exist for many infinite - dimensional models @xcite , with familiar low - dimensional ode models such as the lorenz equations providing a testing ground for the general theory @xcite .",
    "while upper semicontinuity with respect to perturbations is easy to prove , lower semicontinuity ( and hence full continuity ) is more delicate , requiring structural assumptions on the attractor or the assumption of a uniform attraction rate .",
    "however , babin & pilyugin @xcite proved that the global attractor of a parametrised set of semigroups is continuous at a residual set of parameters , by taking advantage of the known upper semicontinuity and then using the fact that upper semicontinuous functions are continuous on a residual set .    here",
    "we reprove results on equi - attraction and residual continuity in a more direct way , which also serves to demonstrate more clearly why these results are true .",
    "given equi - attraction the attractor is the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions , and hence continuous ( the converse requires a generalised version of dini s theorem ) ; more generally , it is the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions , i.e.  a ` baire one ' function , and therefore the set of continuity points forms a residual set .",
    "a semigroup @xmath9 on a complete metric space @xmath10 is a collection of maps @xmath11 such that    * @xmath12 ; * @xmath13 for all @xmath14 ; and * @xmath15 is continuous in @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "a compact set @xmath18 is the _ global attractor _ for @xmath19 if    * @xmath20 for all @xmath21 ; and * for any bounded set @xmath22 , @xmath23 as @xmath6 , where @xmath24 is the semi - distance @xmath25 .",
    "when such a set exists it is unique , the maximal compact invariant set , and the minimal closed set that satisfies ( a2 ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a complete metric space and @xmath26 a parametrised family of semigroups on @xmath27 .",
    "suppose that    * @xmath26 has a global attractor @xmath2 for every @xmath5 ; * there is a bounded subset @xmath3 of @xmath27 such that @xmath4 for every @xmath5 ; and * for @xmath28 , @xmath29 is continuous in @xmath8 , uniformly for @xmath16 in bounded subsets of @xmath27 .",
    "we can strengthen ( l2 ) and weaken ( l3 ) by replacing ` bounded ' by ` compact ' to yield conditions ( l2@xmath30 ) and ( l3@xmath30 ) .",
    "a wide range of dissipative systems with parameters satisfy these assumptions , for example the 2d navier  stokes equations , the scalar kuramoto ",
    "sivashinsky equation , reaction - diffusion equations , and the lorenz equations , all of which are covered in @xcite .    under these mild assumptions",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath2 is upper semicontinuous , @xmath31 see @xcite , for example .",
    "however , lower semicontinuity , that is @xmath32 requires more : either structural conditions on the attractor @xmath33 ( @xmath33 is the closure of the unstable manifolds of a finite number of hyperbolic equilibria , see hale & raugel  @xcite , stuart & humphries @xcite , or robinson @xcite ) or the ` equi - attraction ' hypothesis of li & kloeden @xcite ( see section [ ea ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the continuity of attractors , @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the symmetric hausdorff distance , is only known under restrictive conditions .    in this paper",
    "we view @xmath2 as a function from @xmath0 into the space of closed bounded subsets of @xmath27 , given as the limit of the continuous functions @xmath36 ( see lemma [ dncts ] ) .",
    "indeed , note that given any set @xmath37 it follows from the invariance of the attractor ( a1 ) that @xmath38 and so the the attraction property of the attractor in ( a2 ) implies that @xmath39    uniform convergence ( with respect to @xmath8 ) in ( [ limit ] ) is essentially the ` equi - attraction ' introduced in @xcite , and thus clearly related to continuity of the limiting function @xmath2 ( section [ ea ] ) . given only pointwise ( @xmath8-by-@xmath8 ) convergence in ( [ limit ] ) we can still use the result from the theory of baire category that the pointwise limit of continuous functions ( a ` baire one function ' ) is continuous at a residual set to guarantee that @xmath2 is continuous in @xmath8 on a residual subset of @xmath0 ( section [ bc ] ) .    for both results",
    "the following simple lemma is fundamental .",
    "we let @xmath40 be the collection of all closed and bounded subsets of @xmath27 , and use the symmetric hausdorff distance @xmath41 defined in ( [ shd ] ) as the metric on this space .",
    "[ dncts ] suppose that @xmath3 is bounded and that ( l3 ) holds .",
    "then for any @xmath28 the map @xmath42 is continuous from @xmath0 into @xmath40 .",
    "the same is true if @xmath3 is compact and ( l3@xmath30 ) holds .    given @xmath28 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , ( l3 ) ensures that there exists a @xmath45 such that @xmath46 implies that @xmath47 for every @xmath48 .",
    "it follows that @xmath49 and so @xmath50 from which @xmath51 as required .",
    "first we give a simple proof of the results in @xcite on the equivalence between equi - attraction and continuity . in our framework these follow from two classical results : the continuity of the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous functions and dini s theorem in an abstract formulation .",
    "li & kloeden require ( l1 ) , ( l2 ) , a time - uniform version of ( l3 ) ( see corollary [ cor ] ) , and in addition an ` equi - dissipative ' assumption that there exists a bounded absorbing set @xmath52 such that @xmath53 where @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath8 .",
    "they then show that when @xmath0 is compact , continuity of @xmath2 in @xmath8 is equivalent to equi - attraction , @xmath55    we now give our version of dini s theorem .    [ dini ] for each @xmath56 let @xmath57 be a continuous map , where @xmath52 is a compact metric space and @xmath58 is any metric space .",
    "if @xmath59 is continuous and is the monotonic pointwise limit of @xmath60 , i.e.  for every @xmath61 @xmath62 then @xmath60 converges uniformly to @xmath59 .",
    "given @xmath44 define @xmath63 since @xmath60 and @xmath59 are both continuous , @xmath64 is open and non - decreasing .",
    "since @xmath52 is compact and @xmath65 provides an open cover of @xmath52 , there exists an @xmath66 such that @xmath67 , and so @xmath68 for all @xmath61 for all @xmath69 .",
    "our first result relates continuity to a slightly weakened form of equi - attraction through sequences .",
    "we remark that our proof allows us to dispense with the ` equi - dissipative ' assumption ( [ equid ] ) of @xcite .",
    "[ cty ] assume ( l1 ) and ( l23 ) or ( l2@xmath303@xmath30 ) . if there exist @xmath70 such that @xmath71 then @xmath2 is continuous in @xmath8 for all @xmath5 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath0 is compact then continuity of @xmath2 for all @xmath5 implies that there exist @xmath70 such that ( [ unif ] ) holds .",
    "lemma [ dncts ] guarantees that @xmath72 is continuous for each @xmath73 , and we have already observed in ( [ limit ] ) that @xmath74 therefore @xmath2 is the uniform limit of the continuous functions @xmath36 and so is continuous itself .    for the converse ,",
    "let @xmath75 . for each @xmath43",
    "it follows from ( a2 ) and ( l2 ) that there exists a time @xmath76 such that @xmath77 for all @xmath78 .",
    "it follows from ( l3 ) that there exists an @xmath79 such that @xmath80 for every @xmath8 with @xmath81 .    since @xmath0 is compact @xmath82 for some @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "if @xmath85 then @xmath86 since any @xmath5 is contained in @xmath87 for some @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for some @xmath90 , from which ( [ second ] ) follows by applying @xmath91 repeatedly ( @xmath92 times ) to both sides of ( [ first ] ) .",
    "it follows from ( [ second ] ) that for every @xmath5 , @xmath93 is a decreasing sequence of sets , and hence the convergence of @xmath93 to @xmath2 , ensured by ( [ limit ] ) , is in fact monotonic in the sense of our theorem [ dini ] .",
    "uniform convergence now follows , and finally the fact that @xmath94 yields @xmath95 uniformly in @xmath8 as @xmath96 .    with additional uniform continuity assumptions",
    "we can readily show that continuity implies equi - attraction in the sense of @xcite .",
    "we give one version of this result .",
    "[ cor ] suppose that ( l13 ) hold and that @xmath0 is compact .",
    "assume in addition that @xmath29 is continuous in @xmath16 , uniformly in @xmath8 and for @xmath16 in bounded subsets of @xmath27 and @xmath97 $ ] for any @xmath98",
    ". then continuity of @xmath2 implies ( [ unifkl ] ) .",
    "since @xmath4 and @xmath2 is invariant , given any @xmath44 , by assumption there exists a @xmath45 such that @xmath99 any @xmath100 , for all @xmath5 and @xmath101 .",
    "choose @xmath102 sufficiently large that @xmath103 now for any @xmath104 , @xmath105 , we can write @xmath106 for some @xmath101 , and it follows from ( [ morecty ] ) that @xmath107 with the convergence uniform in @xmath8 as required .",
    "when the rate of attraction to @xmath2 is not uniform in @xmath8 we nevertheless have the convergence in ( [ limit ] ) for each @xmath8 . in general , therefore , one can view the attractor as the ` pointwise ' ( @xmath8-by-@xmath8 ) limit of the sequence of continuous functions @xmath108 . in the case of a sequence of continuous real functions ,",
    "their pointwise limit is a ` baire one function ' , and is continuous on a residual set .",
    "the same ideas in a more abstract setting yield continuity of @xmath2 on a residual subset of @xmath0 .",
    "we use the following abstract result , characterising the continuity of ` baire one ' functions , whose proof ( which we include for completeness ) is an easy variant of that given by oxtoby @xcite . a result in the same general setting as here can be found as theorem 48.5 in munkres @xcite . recall that a set is _ nowhere dense _ if its closure contains no open sets , and a set is _ residual _ if its complement is the countable union of nowhere dense sets .",
    "any residual set is dense .",

    "if @xmath59 is the pointwise limit of @xmath60 , i.e.  @xmath110 for each @xmath5 ( and the limit exists ) , then the points of continuity of @xmath59 form a residual subset of @xmath0 .    before the proof we make the following observation : if @xmath111 and @xmath112 are open subsets of @xmath0 with @xmath113 , then @xmath114 .",
    "otherwise @xmath115 , the complement of @xmath112 in @xmath0 , is a closed set containing @xmath111 , and since @xmath116 is the intersection of all closed sets that contain @xmath111 , @xmath117 , a contradiction .      to show that @xmath120 is nowhere dense , i.e.  that its closure contains no open set , let @xmath121 note that @xmath64 is closed , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "choose any open set @xmath124 , and consider @xmath125 .",
    "since @xmath116 is a complete metric space , it follows from the baire category theorem that there exists an @xmath73 such that @xmath126 contains an open set @xmath127 . from the remark before the proof",
