    "it is by now an often repeated fact that the so - called ( single - band ) hubbard model was originally introduced to explain ferromagnetism @xcite . in what followed , however , it turned out to be rather a generic model for antiferromagnetism .",
    "ferromagnetism seemed to require additional ingredients , for instance the existence of degenerate bands which favor ferromagnetism based on hund s rule or in the insulating case certain additional ferromagnetic couplings and/or correlated hopping terms .",
    "both scenarios were proven rigorously in recent years ( see @xcite and references therein for the former and @xcite and references therein for the latter ) .",
    "the hubbard model and its possible ferromagnetic ground state are of renewed interest @xcite .",
    "there are many works in the field based on quasi one dimensional ( @xmath4 ) systems triggered by the prediction of ferromagnetism in double minima systems at low particle density @xcite and by the numerous possibilities of analytical and numerical calculations @xcite in @xmath4 .",
    "exact calculations are possible in infinite dimensions ( @xmath5 ) @xcite . for intermediate dimensions ( @xmath6 )",
    "numerical and approximate methods are employed @xcite .",
    "an important mile stone in the research of ferromagnetism in hubbard models is the work of nagaoka @xcite .",
    "it showed that at infinite local repulsion a single electron above half - filling favors the saturated ferromagnetic ground state ( henceforth : nagaoka state ) if the underlying lattice has loops which allow interference .",
    "for bipartite lattices particle - hole symmetry extends these results to hole doping .",
    "this result reveals the beauty and the difficulty of the question for which lattices and for which fillings the nagaoka state is the ground state . at @xmath7",
    "there is only the hopping left as a global energy scale .",
    "thus there is no expansion parameter , no adiabatic limit , and no competition of energy scales .",
    "the issue is solely a question of the lattice structure , i.e.  the possible paths on the lattice , and of the filling .    unfortunately , there are no extensions of nagaoka s result to macroscopic dopings",
    ". only non - macroscopic numbers of holes could be treated @xcite .",
    "therefore , we choose another route in the present work and investigate the stability of the nagaoka state towards a single spin flip .",
    "if such a flip lowers the energy then the nagaoka state is not the ground state .",
    "otherwise it is locally stable .",
    "the drawback that we treat only local stability in this way is not very serious .",
    "there is no indication that the transition away from saturation should not be continuous at @xmath8 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "a more serious drawback is the fact that even the single spin flip is too difficult a problem to be solved completely on finite dimensional lattices . in the limit of infinite dimensional lattices , however , it was solved @xcite .",
    "thereby it was shown that relatively simple variational ansatzes provide already a qualitative insight in the tendency of a certain lattice to have a nagaoka state as ground state .",
    "et al_. showed that only an extremely sophisticated variational ansatz @xcite yields a further reduction of the region of possible nagaoka state stability in comparison to simpler ansatzes @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of the present paper to extend previous work on variational ansatzes decisively @xcite , both in the completeness of the ansatzes and in the types of the lattices considered .",
    "so far , variational ansatzes considered a finite vicinity of the flipped spin and treated a finite number of parameters leading to matrix eigenvalue problems . here we will show that a resolvent approach is capable to deal implicitly with an _ infinite _ number of variational parameters .",
    "no explicit knowledge of the variational wave function is required .",
    "a similar approach was used recently by okabe@xcite for the square lattice and the simple cubic lattice , too . in his work , however , the reduction of the resolvent to simple integrals over the density of states ( dos ) , which we succeeded to achieve in most cases , is lacking .",
    "we will present elegant simple expressions for the nagaoka instability line @xmath9 which apply to most common lattices .",
    "these results make it possible for everyone to check easily whether or not one can expect a ferromagnetic ground state for a given lattice .",
    "we will show that two main features favor the occurrence of a saturated ferromagnetic ground state    1 .   a highly asymmetric density of states with large values at the lower band edge ( after particle - hole transformation ) .",
    "non - bipartiteness of the lattice , i.e.  frustration due to loops of three sites .",
    "of course , the two points are intimately related .",
    "the setup of our article is as follows . in the rest of the introduction we will present certain variational ansatzes used so far to investigate the nagaoka state stability . in the subsequent section [ sect : resapp ]",

    "in summary , we investigated the stability of the nagaoka state for a series of two- and three - dimensional lattices : the square @xmath10- , the square @xmath10-@xmath11- , the simple cubic , the _ bcc _ , the honeycomb , the triangular , the kagome , and the _ fcc _ ( _ hcp _ ) lattice . the results were mostly variational in nature and concerned the energy change due to a single spin flip . by the resolvent approach the eigenvalue problem in the variational subspace was reduced to a matrix inversion problem .",
    "the relatively simple structure of the matrices under consideration permits to convert the matrix inversion into a scalar inversion ( or the inversion of a @xmath359 matrix ) . for the @xmath10-@xmath11 square lattice a perturbative approach in @xmath10 was used as well for investigating the @xmath360 limit .",
    "the ansatzes res0 - res3 are particularly simple for unfrustrated , isotropic , homogeneous lattices with nearest neighbor hopping ( sect .",
    "[ sect : resapp ] , appendix [ app : unfrustrated ] ) .",
    "for frustrated , non - bipartite lattices our approach is still tractable , though more cumbersome . to demonstrate its tractability we derived formulae for the triangular lattice ( non - bipartite , bravais lattice ) and for the kagome lattice ( non - bipartite , non - bravais lattice ) .",
    "we believe that our variational criteria are well suited in order to investigate the lattice dependence of saturated ferromagnetism in the hubbard model since they cover the most relevant local excitations in the spin - up fermi sea but are still simple enough to be evaluated routinely on various lattices in various dimensions . local and non - local band narrowing effects are present in these approaches . since this fact is not obvious in the complete approaches we resort to the previous result ( [ skaband ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath361 clearly describes the band narrowing of the flipped spin .",
    "it comprises two factors one of which is local ( @xmath149 ) and thus survives also in the limit @xmath362 .",
    "the other factor ( @xmath363 is very important as well since it vanishes equally on @xmath364 . but",
    "in the limit @xmath365 on scaling @xmath366 @xcite the latter factor degenerates to unity .",
    "this clearly shows its non - local character .",
    "note the importance of the sequence of limits .",
    "the more sophisticated variational approaches discussed in the present work ( res0 - res3 ) comprise the ansatz ( [ ansatz : gw ] ) .",
    "thus they contain also local and non - local band narrowing effects .",
    "the other main effect is a direct energy lifting of the minority electron due to the infinite ( or large ) on - site repulsion .",
    "since the minority electron blocks a site , the majority electrons loose the kinetic energy related to hopping onto or from this site , namely @xmath367 .",
    "this is seen best in the kinetic matrix elements in ( [ xelemb ] ) or in the energy denominator ( [ fdef ] ) .",
    "futhermore , we like to draw the reader s attention to the non - orthogonality as it can be discerned in ( [ xelema ] ) .",
    "it is very difficult to comprehend its effect intuitively .",
    "but we know from the extensive efforts to reduce the critical doping by including more and more correlations @xcite that this non - orthogonality hinders the spin flip to gain enough energy to destabilize the nagaoka state . the added states do not reduce the critical doping any further since they do not really enhance the accessible hilbert space .    besides the achievement of easily evaluated ansatzes the comparison of the phase diagrams presented here yields the following main results . for bipartite lattices the possible nagaoka region shrinks rapidly with increasing coordination number @xmath37 ( cf . square and simple cubic lattice ) .",
    "herrmann and nolting did not investigate low - dimensional lattices because they suppose that ferromagnetism is excluded in @xmath4 and 2 by the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite .",
    "note , however , that neither the mermin - wagner theorem makes any statement on ground states @xcite nor any extended theorem can exclude a ferromagnetic ground state since the total spin as _ conserved _ quantity is not affected by quantum fluctuations .",
    "the shrinking of the nagaoka region on increasing coordination number can be understood from the lowering of the dos at the band edges or , equivalently , as effect of a lower and lower band edge @xmath47 .    for the above reasons we investigated low - dimensional non - bipartite lattices where",
    "low dos at the lower band edge can be avoided .",
    "indeed , we found that the possible nagaoka regions are enlarged considerably .",
    "this is true for electron doping for conventional hopping ( @xmath368 ) whereas saturated ferromagnetism in the hole doped region ( @xmath369 ) can be excluded by our results . treating the electron doping also as hole doping after a particle - hole transformation , i.e.  @xmath368 @xmath370 @xmath371 , this phenomenon is easily understood : @xmath372 .",
    "the ratio of the lower band edges is @xmath373 for the triangular and the kagome lattice , and @xmath374 for the _ fcc _ and _ hcp _ lattice . in infinite dimensions",
    "it becomes even @xmath375 for the generalizations of the _ fcc _ lattice @xcite .",
    "for these generalizations one has @xmath376 .",
    "the above observations concern already the asymmetry of the density of states .",
    "our results clearly show that a large asymmetry favors ferromagnetism .",
    "it is most useful to have a _ large dos at the lower band edge _ in the hole doping picture to stabilize the nagaoka state .",
    "note that this is _ not _ equivalent to the well - known stoner criterion @xmath377 which concerns only the dos at the fermi level @xcite .",
    "the best situation is to have a strongly diverging singularity at the lower band edge or close to it as we found in the investigation of the @xmath10-@xmath11 model with tunable dos and as was also observed previously for _ fcc_-type lattices @xcite .",
    "our results concerning the @xmath10-@xmath11 model extend previous ones @xcite since we treat all ratios of @xmath10 and @xmath11 and all fillings @xmath35 .",
    "et al_. focussed on the fermi levels at the van - hove singularity .",
    "thus the stoner criterion is at the basis of their investigation albeit it goes technically beyond this mean - field criterion .",
    "herrmann and nolting used a two - pole method ( sda : self - consistent spectral density approach ) to investigate ferromagnetism for the simple cubic , the @xmath5 hypercubic , the @xmath5 _ fcc _ , and the _ bcc _ lattice @xcite at zero and at finite temperature .",
    "their qualitative findings for zero temperature are similar to ours .",
    "we like , however , to point out that the two - pole method they employ is indeed a generalization of the gutzwiller ansatz in ( [ ansatz : gw ] ) with @xmath30 to finite temperatures and non - saturated magnetizations . for @xmath8 and",
    "saturation it reduces to ( [ ansatz : gw ] ) with @xmath30 .",
    "thus it is not astounding that they found a good agreement to the results of shastry _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "our approaches go far beyond ( [ ansatz : gw ] ) ( barring the question of the extendability to finite temperatures ) .",
    "this can be seen for instance for the simple cubic lattice where we found @xmath378 well below @xmath379 @xcite .",
    "already roth found by numerical calculation in the variational subspace of res0 the number @xmath380 @xcite . for the _ bcc _ lattice",
    "one finds again that the sda method @xcite reproduces the gutzwiller result @xmath285 for saturated ferromagnetism whereas res0 yields a considerably lower value of @xmath286 .",
    "thus one is led to the conclusion that the sda two - pole method can not be exact as claimed in the strong coupling limit @xcite .",

    "more important for the following is the observation that @xmath570 can be diagonalized by an orthogonal , i.e.real , transformation since it is real symmetric .",
    "thus the phase of @xmath571 is completely given by the plane wave factor @xmath572 in ( [ kagphas ] ) .",
    "since we wish to treat the frustrated case ( @xmath319 ) we modify the ansatz ( [ res0_ansatz_unfrus ] ) by introducing an additional phase factor @xmath573 depending only on the sub - lattice and being unity on sub - lattice 1 , @xmath574 on sub - lattice 2 , and @xmath575 on sub - lattice 3 @xmath576 the resulting matrix elements @xmath577 and @xmath578 are the same as in ( [ xelemu1],[xelemu2 ] ) since the phase factor cancels at each site . but @xmath579 does change into @xmath580 the change in the second term is obvious . the change in the first term @xmath581 is less trivial . in a first step one obtains @xmath582 transforming the terms of the sum like @xmath583 and @xmath584 leads to @xmath585 the last equality holds since @xmath586 in ( [ kagphas ] ) is real .",
