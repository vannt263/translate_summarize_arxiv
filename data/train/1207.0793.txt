    "it is remarkable , that a century after the discovery of quantum mechanics , it seems that we are no closer to a consensus about its interpretation , than we were in the beginning .",
    "the collapse of the quantum state at the process of measurement which appears in all textbooks of quantum theory does not have an unambiguous definition and a reasonable explanation .",
    "the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) argument @xcite that quantum mechanics is incomplete , together with bell s proof @xcite that it can not be completed without some nonlocal phenomena made the task of creating an understandable picture of quantum mechanics very difficult .",
    "they showed that some radical changes in our classical understanding of reality have to be made ; e.g. constructing a physical process of collapse @xcite , accepting the existence of parallel worlds @xcite , or adding non - local hidden variables . perhaps , the most attractive way to stay close to the single - world classical picture of reality",
    "is to accept the de broglie - bohm ( dbb ) interpretation @xcite which includes hidden variables , the positions of quantum particles moving on continuous trajectories resembling classical physics .",
    "the dbb interpretation solves several issues of the quantum measurement problem .",
    "it defines unambiguously when a collapse of the quantum state takes place , it explains in a very elegant way what happens in the epr experiment and it restores determinism in physics .",
    "note , however , that it does not restore locality in physics .    in this paper we will argue that a simple formula for bohmian velocity of a particle when it passes a region of the overlap of superposed wavepackets can be widely applied . in particular , it helps analyzing so - called `` surrealistic trajectories '' appearing in a setup proposed by englert _",
    "@xcite which offer a dramatic demonstration of the nonlocal nature of the dbb theory and its consequences for the interpretation of measurements .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we review our approach to the dbb theory . in section 2.1",
    "we present the `` velocity formula '' , in section 2.2 we apply it to the stern - gerlach ( sg ) experiment and in section 2.3 to the epr - bohm experiment . in section 2.4",
    "we analyze an experiment in which an `` empty wave '' manifests itself by taking the bohmian particle from the other wave packet . in section 3",
    "we introduce four types of position measurements . in section 4",
    "we present main results : our analysis of experiments which are devised to monitor the trajectory of bohmian position using the four types of position detectors . in section 4.1",
    "we consider particles with spin for which the velocity formula is exact and shows unambiguously the cases of surrealistic trajectories . in section 4.2",
    "we modify the experiments , such that they allow the analysis of a spinless particle . in this case",
    "the velocity formula is valid only approximately and we compare it with an exact calculation of bohmian position trajectories .",
    "since all our analysis was done with wave packets having unphysical sharp edges , we perform , in section 4.3 , computer calculations for gaussian wave packets taking into account their time evolution . comparing the results of exact calculations and our toy model analysis demonstrates effectiveness of our approach .",
    "the discussion of section 5 concludes the paper .",
    "the dbb theory postulates that the quantum state evolves according to the schrodinger equation and never collapses .",
    "in addition , every particle ( photons currently not included ) has definite position at all times and its motion is governed in a simple way by the quantum state .",
    "the history of the dbb is complex .",
    "de broglie @xcite first presented it in 1927 and subsequently changed his position , presenting a significantly different view @xcite .",
    "bohm @xcite made a clear exposition in 1952 , although he never viewed it as a proposal for a final theory , but rather as a way for developing a new and better approach .",
    "the motions of `` particles '' in the de broglie and bohm theories are identical , but the important difference between these formulations is that de broglie used an equation for velocity ( determined by the quantum state ) as the guiding equation for the particle , while bohm used equation for acceleration ( a la newton ) introducing a `` quantum potential '' ( likewise determined by the quantum state ) .",
    "the version we find the most attractive was advocated by bell @xcite and it is closer to de broglie as the equation of motion is given in terms of the velocity .",
    "an important aspect is that the only `` bohmian '' variables in this approach are particle positions ( and variables like velocity that are defined in terms of positions ) , while all other variables , e.g. spin , are described solely by the quantum state .",
    "originally , it was postulated that the initial distribution of bohmian positions of particles is according to probability law @xmath0 in configuration space .",
    "there are claims that this postulate is unnecessary because in large systems ( i.e. , composed of many particles ) even if the bohmian position in configuration space starts in a low probability region , it will typically move to a high probability point very rapidly @xcite . since in this approach we still have to postulate something about initial bohmian position  it can not be where @xmath1 we see little advantage of it relative to the standard proposal , especially since the latter is applicable for all systems .",
    "we feel that dbb theory needs another postulate : _ our observations supervene on bohmian trajectories and not on a quantum state_. this postulate is needed for defending dbb theory from so called `` idle wheel attack '' according to which dbb theory is `` the many - worlds interpretation in denial '' @xcite .",
    "indeed , the quantum state already includes a structure corresponding to our reality .",
    "however , it also includes structures corresponding to numerous other parallel realities and we need a postulate to downgrade these structures .",
    "then , a single structure of trajectories will remain to manifest our single - world reality .",
    "myrvold @xcite has pointed out that the existence of this postulate brings `` us '' or conscious observer into the definition and thus apparently contradicts the claim of proponents of dbb that it does not require the concept of an observer .",
    "however , one can argue that the trajectories are the primary ontology and then it follows that only they supervene on everything `` real '' and , in particular , on our experience .",
    "so , let us define the dbb theory we consider here .",
    "the ontology of the theory consists of a quantum state , i.e. , the wave function , and the trajectories of all particles in three - dimensional space .",
    "our experiences supervene directly on the trajectories alone .",
    "the quantum state evolves according to the schrodinger equation ( or , more precisely , according to its relativistic generalization ) .",
    "it is completely deterministic , the value of the wave function at any single time determines the wave function at all times in the future and in the past .",
    "the evolution of the particle positions is also deterministic .",
    "the velocity of each particle at a particular time depends on the wave function and positions of all the particles at that time .",
    "namely , the velocity of particle @xmath2 at time @xmath3 is given by : @xmath4 ( we use roman text font for bohmian positions and bold font to signify that @xmath5 is a spinor . )",
    "an equivalent , but suggestive statement of this law separates the procedure into two steps @xcite .",
    "first , a _ conditional wave function _ of particle @xmath2 at particular time is defined by fixing the positions of all other particle to be their bohmian positions at that time : @xmath6 note that @xmath7 still carries spin variables of all the particles .",
    "the velocity of the @xmath2th particle is then : @xmath8 this velocity formula ensures that a bohmian particle inside a moving wave packet which has group velocity @xmath9 `` rides '' on the wave with the same velocity , @xmath10 . for a general wave , which does not consist of a single well- localized wavepacket , as occurs , e.g.",
    ", in a two slit experiment , the trajectory might be complicated and we have to perform calculations ( [ rdot ] ) to find it .",
    "an interesting case , appearing in numerous gedanken ( as well as real ) experiments , is when the wave is a superposition of a few well localized wave packets .",
    "of course , one can still use formula ( [ rdot ] ) and calculate the trajectories ( with the help of a computer ) , but we are looking for a simple method which gives at least the basic picture without complicated calculations . one simple tool is the `` no - crossing theorem '' which has been used extensively for so called `` surrealistic trajectories '' examples @xcite but its effectiveness is limited in practice to special classes of problems .",
    "we argue that for finding bohmian particle trajectory we can use , instead , a simple formula which says that a velocity of a bohmian particle position located in the overlap of localized wave packets is given by a weighted average of the velocities of these packets . in many cases",
    "this formula provides exact results and in others it yields a very good approximation of the bohmian trajectory .",
    "consider the effective ( conditional ) wave wave function of a particle consisting of a superposition of two localized wave packets @xmath11 moving with well defined velocities @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively and without significant spreading .",
    "then , the velocity formula for the bohmian position of this particle is : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "this formula is exact if the wave packets are entangled with orthogonal spin states of this or another particle .",
    "otherwise , it provides a good approximation which sometimes improves when the wave packets are entangled with other systems .",
    "if spreading of the wave packets is not negligible , then @xmath17 should be replaced by local currents in each wave packet .",
    "one of the most striking quantum behaviors can be observed in spin measurements which are performed using sg devices .",
    "the most vivid example is the greenberger - horne - zeilinger - mermin setup @xcite in which four alternative sets of measurements of spin @xmath18 and spin @xmath19 components are considered on three entangled particles @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 in a greenberger - horne - zeilinger state : @xmath22 the outcomes of the local measurements fulfill the following four equations ( each line corresponding to a different set of possible measurements ) : @xmath23 considering the product of these equation we immediately see that there is no solution for outcomes of local measurement which fulfills all of them .",
    "thus , einstein s hope that quantum mechanics can be completed such that all `` elements of reality '' will have definite values can not be accomplished . in the dbb picture , indeed , spin components have no definite values , nevertheless , everything is deterministic , so the outcome of any sg experiment is fixed prior to experiment .",
    "let us see how it happens .    in our simplified model",
    ", the initial quantum state of the particle is an equal weight wave in the form of a thin ( in @xmath18 direction ) box with negligible spreading moving in the @xmath18 direction , with a pure spin state .",
    "it has no spatial dependence in the @xmath19 direction , so we will not mention it .",
    "we arrange that the wave packet reaches the origin at time @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 we will consider below also an exact solution for a gaussian wave function in order to show that our toy model faithfully represents the behavior of the system . in the simple model , we can immediately see that the bohmian particle rides the wave , i.e. , the position of any bohmian particle placed in the support of the particle s wave function is described , for @xmath27 , by : @xmath28    in order to avoid subtleties of a real sg experiment @xcite , we consider a simplified gedanken model of it . at time",
    "@xmath24 , when the wave packet reaches the origin , a spin - dependent momentum kick in the @xmath29 direction is provided without changes in other directions .",
    "this results in a vertical component of the wave packet velocity of magnitude @xmath30 for the respective spin components .",
    "the wave function at @xmath31 is described by @xmath32 in order to keep the equations tractable , we will omit from now on everything related to the @xmath18 axis .",
    "then , the wave function ( [ psiout ] ) will have the following form : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 it is easy to calculate the motion of bohmian particle after the momentum kick . during the time the particle is located in the overlap of the two wave packets , the @xmath29 component of the velocity is @xmath36 at some time",
    ", the particle will leave the ( changing ) overlap area and from that moment will ride one of the wave packets .",
    "thus , to find the result of the measurement , we have to calculate what will happen first : will the particle be `` overtaken '' by the bottom of the @xmath37 wave packet ( and from then on will ride the @xmath38 wave packet ) or will it be overtaken by the top of the @xmath38 wave packet ( and will subsequently ride the @xmath37 wave packet ) ? to this end",
    "we assume that the particle moves with velocity ( [ vz ] ) and calculate the hypothetical times of these events .",
    "the earlier one is the one that will actually take place .",
    "these times can be found from the following equations : @xmath39 the equality of times corresponds to @xmath40 thus , any bohmian particle in the upper @xmath41 fraction of the wave will be `` caught '' by the @xmath37 wave packet , so that the particle will be detected in the upper beam which corresponds to the outcome of the experiment @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , any particle in the lower @xmath43 part of the wave will end up in the @xmath38 wave packet and the outcome of the experiment will be @xmath44 . in fig.1 a particular example with @xmath45",
    "is presented . from eq.([overlap1 ] ) we see that the bohmian position will be caught by wave packet @xmath37 at @xmath46 .",
    "it will ride at the point located @xmath47 below the center of the wave packet @xmath37 .     and initial bohmian position @xmath48 .",
    "darker shade of grey indicates higher amplitude of the wave function @xmath49 at times when @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 .,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ] +    in spite of the fact that the quantum wave has components corresponding to two outcomes , the dbb theory shows in a deterministic and very simple way how a single outcome emerges at each experimental run .",
    "the quantum state ( [ psiin ] ) and the initial bohmian position @xmath52 determine the outcome of the experiment .    in fact this is not the whole story : @xmath53 and @xmath54 alone are not enough to decide the outcome of the spin component measurement : @xmath42 or @xmath44 .",
    "we have to specify the design of our measuring device . to show this in the most vivid way , consider the case of @xmath55 .",
    "we can , without changing anything about the initial quantum state and bohmian position of our particle , change the sg device such that it will provide the spin - depended momentum kick in the opposite direction .",
    "( it is instructive that a naive rotation by @xmath56 of the sg device does not cause the desired change @xcite . )",
    "the wave function of the particle for @xmath31 will then be @xmath57 the bohmian trajectory will not be altered due to this change , but this time , detection of the particle in the upper beam will correspond to the outcome @xmath44 .",
    "the `` contextuality '' of the measurement in the dbb theory discussed above does not help to resolve the epr paradox .",
    "let us consider the bohm version of the epr experiment with the sg devices described above .",
    "two particles in distant laboratories , 1 and 2 , are initially in a maximally entangled state of their spin variables and in the product spatial state .",
    "we denote positions of the particles relative to their local frames of reference : @xmath58 if we perform a measurement on particle 1 using sg device described above , the quantum state will become : @xmath59 a simple straightforward analysis , similar to the case of a single spin@xmath60 particle , shows that if the bohmian position of particle 1 has initially @xmath61 , the particle will move up .",
    "indeed , the measurement interaction splits the wave packet into a superposition of two wave packets of equal weight . while the bohmian position is inside the overlap of the two packets , it has zero component of velocity in the @xmath29 direction and it is the top of the wave packet @xmath38 which will be the first to reach it .",
    "there is a symmetry between particle 1 and particle 2 , so if initially @xmath62 and we perform sg measurement on particle 2 instead , it will also move up .",
    "nothing prevents us from initially having both @xmath61 and @xmath62 , but they can not both move `` up '' since in the epr - bohm experiment the outcomes have to be anticorrelated .    to simplify the analysis ,",
    "let us assume that we first perform a measurement on particle 1 and then on particle 2 .",
    "initially , and until the bohmian position of the first particle leaves the overlap of its two wave packets , @xmath63 , so the conditional wave function of the particle 2 is : @xmath64 but when the bohmian position of particle 1 leaves the overlap area , @xmath65 , the conditional wave function of the second particle collapses to @xmath66 for such a wave function , in the sg measurement of particle 2 all its bohmian positions will move down and thus , the spin measurements will indeed show anticorrelation .",
    "what resolves the epr paradox in the dbb picture is its nonlocality .",
    "there is a real action at a distance . by performing or not performing a measurement on particle 1",
    ", we can change the outcome the sg measurement on particle 2 which takes place in a space - like separated region .",
    "the collapse of the conditional wave function of particle 2 happens instantaneously at the moment the bohmian position of particle 1 leaves the overlap area of its two wave packets .",
    "the picture presented above , apart from its non - locality , is very natural and attractive .",
    "a less intuitive feature of bohmian trajectories shows up when we bring together two wave packets , one of which containing the bohmian position .",
    "let us consider again the wave function of the particle after leaving the sg device ( [ psiout ] ) and arrange at time @xmath67 a spin dependent momentum kick in the opposite direction twice as strong as the previous one . at time @xmath68 , the two wave packets will fully overlap . in order to keep the notation compact",
    ", we will define this time as @xmath24 ( i.e. set the clocks back by @xmath69 ) .",
    "then , for @xmath70 , the wave function will be @xmath71    consider again the example in which bohmian trajectory started at @xmath72 using the velocity formula ( [ v ] ) .",
    "bohmian particle will ride the wave packet @xmath37 at the location @xmath47 below the center of the wave packet , see fig .",
    "the two wave packets fully overlap at time @xmath24 . shortly before this , at time @xmath73 , when @xmath74 , the bohmian trajectory enters the overlap of the two wave packets . for the region of the overlap , formula ( [ v ] )",
    "yields @xmath75 .",
    "thus , at time @xmath76 , when @xmath77 , the particle leaves the overlap region and rides the center of the wave packet @xmath38 , see fig .",

    "this is an example of an action of a `` pilot wave '' while for bohm this is an interaction due to a quantum potential .",
    "this phenomenon persists even if we try to monitor the trajectory using apparently legitimate position detectors .",
    "since the detectors show one trajectory , whereas the bohmian particle actually takes , according to the theory , a different trajectory , the latter were named `` surrealistic trajectories '' @xcite .",
    "we will analyze this phenomenon considering four different types of position detectors . in all cases , the detector records the presence of a particle in its vicinity via certain change in a quantum state of a detector particle which will later be amplified to a macroscopic recording in the detector .",
    "the differences between the detectors are in the type of microscopic record of the detector particle .",
    "note , that the amplification to a macroscopic record performed too early might change the action of a detector , so it has to be done after relevant evolution of the particle s wave .",
    "to avoid cumbersome notation and confusion between the measured particle and detector particle we will call , from now on , the detector particle a `` neutron '' .",
    "this is just a name , we do not say that neutrons are typically used in position detectors .",
    "+      this is a model of a standard measuring device which shows its outcome by a pointer , see fig .",
    "the neutron is initially at rest in a well localized wave packet .",
    "we will consider its wave function in one dimension , @xmath78 , and model it as above ( [ chi1 ] ) .",
    "we will use `` @xmath79 '' to signify variables of the measuring device .",
    "the interaction is such that if our measured particle is present at the detector , the neutron is quickly shifted by a distance @xmath80 larger than the width of its wave packet : @xmath81 we call it a `` bohmian position detector '' because the information about the result of the measurement is written ( apart from the quantum state of the neutron ) in the bohmian position of the neutron : `` particle is not present '' corresponds to the bohmian position @xmath82 $ ] and `` particle present '' corresponds to the bohmian position @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "+      the spin of the neutron flips if the particle is present , see fig . 4 :",
    "@xmath84 note that in this case , the bohmian position of the neutron does not `` see '' the particle .",
    "it does not change its trajectory due to the presence or absence of the particle . only later , when the spin of the neutron is observed , will the bohmian trajectory of the neutron change accordingly .",
    "but we assume that this stage happens long after the phenomenon we discuss takes place .",
    "+      the neutron changes the relative phase between the spatially separated parts of its wave function depending on the presence of the observed particle see fig .",
    "5 . in this detector ,",
    "the neutron is in a superposition of two well localized wave packets : one , @xmath78 , is near the place where the measured particle might be and the other , @xmath85 , is far away .",
    "initially it is in a superposition @xmath86 .",
    "the measurement interaction is such that if the particle is present , the potential near it leads to a relative phase of @xmath56 and the neutron state changes as follows : @xmath87 otherwise , it remains unchanged .",
    "again , the bohmian position of the neutron does not `` see '' the particle . it does not change its trajectory due to the presence or absence of the particle . only later ,",
    "when we bring together the two wave packets of the neutron together for measuring the phase , will the bohmian trajectories of the neutron change accordingly .",
    "+      the quantum state of the neutron is spread out uniformly on a ring of radius @xmath88 located near the place where presence of our particle is tested , see fig .",
    ". the wave function of the neutron is effectively one - dimensional .",
    "initially , the wave function of the neutron and its bohmian position rotate in clockwise direction and this motion remains unchanged if the particle is not present .",
    "if it is present , wave function of the neutron changes : @xmath89 thus , the current and the bohmian velocity change the direction of rotation .",
    "the outcome of the measurement is recorded in the motion of the bohmian position of the neutron : it moves with velocity @xmath90 in the clockwise direction if there is no particle and it moves with the same velocity in the counterclockwise direction if the particle is present .",
    "this detector , however , is not a bohmian position detector : the bohmian position of the neutron can be anywhere on the ring whether the particle is present or not .",
    "we will now try to observe the action of an empty wave using position detectors .",
    "we will start the analysis with bohmian detector ( i ) .",
    "we put our detector in the lower arm of the device , fig .",
    "the wave function of the particle and the neutron for @xmath70 is @xmath91 consider again the initial bohmian position of the particle @xmath92 .",
    "since at time @xmath93 the bohmian position of the particle is inside the wave packet in the upper arm of the interferomenter , the conditional wave function of the neutron remains @xmath78 and thus , its bohmian position remains unchanged : @xmath82 $ ] .",
    "then , at time @xmath70 , the conditional wave function of the particle is : @xmath94 therefore , the bohmian position of the particle will continue to ride wave packet moving towards detector @xmath95 at the location @xmath47 below its center .",
    "this corresponds to our expectation : the particle detected in @xmath95 does not leave a record at the detector located on another path : we observe no surrealistic trajectories .",
    "now consider spin detector ( ii ) .",
    "the neutron starts in the state @xmath96 and flips its spin at time @xmath93 if the particle passes through the lower arm .",
    "then , the wave function of the particle and the neutron for @xmath70 is : @xmath97 the presence of the spin detector changes nothing regarding the motion of the bohmian particle relative to the case without the detector ( [ psioutnox1 ] ) : before time @xmath93 the wave packets @xmath95 and @xmath98 were entangled to the spin of the particle and now we add entanglement to the spin of the neutron .",
    "the spatial density of the particle remains the same and formula ( [ v ] ) holds exactly .",
    "the bohmian particle does change its direction at the area of the overlap and , as in the case without detector , it moves up towards detector @xmath98 , see fig .",
    "we can see the meaning of the requirement that the amplification to a macroscopical record should take place `` later '' .",
    "the validity of eq .",
    "( [ psioutnox33 ] ) relies on the fact that the amplification did not take place .",
    "the amplification had to be done after the the particle wave packets overlap , @xmath31 . at the moment",
    "the bohmian position of the particle leaves the overlap area , the neutron conditional wave function collapses to @xmath99 .",
    "this naively corresponds to the neutron recording the particle in the lower arm in spite of the fact that the bohmian trajectory passed through the upper arm .",
    "+   +   +   +    we can place numerous spin detectors along the arms of the interferometer , and when we look at them later , they will all show a continuous trajectory along lower arm which is _ not _ the bohmian trajectory .",
    "this phenomenon has received the name `` surrealistic trajectory '' @xcite .",
    "we have followed bohm s original prescription for incorporating spin into the dbb theory .",
    "it is , however , sometimes treated differently @xcite , so it is important to see if the phenomenon of surrealistic trajectories arises also without spin detectors .",
    "we will show that measuring position with `` phase detector '' ( iii ) leads to the same phenomenon .",
    "the wave function of the particle and the neutron of the phase detector for @xmath70 is : @xmath100 the conditional wave function of the particle is either @xmath101 when the bohmian position of the neutron is far away from the lower arm of the interferometer , or @xmath102 when the bohmian position of the neutron is near the lower arm . in both cases",
    "the bohmian trajectory of the particle ( which started with @xmath92 ) is in the upper arm until the overlap with the empty wave , where it turns toward detector @xmath98 , fig .",
    "7c . indeed , the wave function ( [ psioutnox3 + ] ) is the same as ( [ psioutnox1 ] ) and the change of sign in ( [ psioutnox3- ] ) , does not influence bohmian trajectory of the particle due to entanglement with the spin .",
    "the particle will be found in detector @xmath98 and this will lead to the collapse of the neutron conditional wave function to @xmath103 which corresponds to detection of the particle . we again get a surrealistic trajectory : the phase detector `` detects '' the particle where the bohmian position is absent .    finally , consider a detector of type ( iv ) .",
    "it is , in a sense , a bohmian detector , since the outcome is written ( also ) in the behavior of bohmian position of the neutron .",
    "however , the measurement outcome is registered in the bohmian velocity rather than position .",
    "the wave function of the particle and the neutron , for @xmath70 is : @xmath104 the bohmian position of the particle ( which started with @xmath92 ) takes the upper arm .",
    "thus , the conditional wave function for the neutron before @xmath24 is @xmath105 .",
    "nothing happens at time @xmath93 to the neutron , its bohmian position continue to move on the ring in the clockwise direction since its conditional wave function does not change .",
    "this `` no change '' is , in fact , equivalent to the detection of the particle in the upper arm , since it is given that the particle is in one of the arms .",
    "this `` record '' however , does not cause the collapse of the conditional wave function of the particle as with detector ( i ) : whatever the bohmian position of the neutron is , it does not distinguish between rotating wave functions in different directions , as the probability to find the neutron anywhere on the ring is constant in both cases .",
    "the conditional spatial wave function of the particle vary only in the relative phase which is irrelevant because of the entanglement with the spin state of the particle .",
    "so , once again , formula ( [ v ] ) yields that the empty wave packet moving in the lower arm , after the overlap with the wave packet from the upper arm , will `` capture '' the bohmian particle and will lead it towards detector @xmath98 , see fig . 7d .    when the bohmian position of the particle leaves the overlap area of the wave packets the conditional wave function of the neutron collapses to @xmath106 .",
    "together with this change of the wave function , the rotation of the bohmian position of the neutron changes from clockwise to counterclockwise .",
    "so , in the end , we are left with the detector naively showing that the particle passed through the lower arm , while the bohmian trajectory passed through the upper arm .",
    "the trajectory is surrealistic again .",
    "note that the record on detector at lower arm appeared after the time of the interaction between the particle and the detector .",
    "it is of interest to consider placing detector of type ( iv ) in the upper arm , instead .",
    "a straightforward analysis shows that in this case , at the time of the interaction between the particle and the neutron , the neutron will `` record '' the presence of the particle there by changing its conditional wave function and changing the direction of the velocity of its bohmian position .",
    "however , these records will subsequently be completely erased , leaving us with `` no change '' in the detector which corresponds to the particle passing through lower arm , demonstrating surrealistic trajectories once again .",
    "in all the examples above , the simple formula ( [ v ] ) for the velocity of bohmian position was exact .",
    "this happened because the overlapping wave packets were entangled with orthogonal spin states and therefore would not interfere with each other .",
    "let us now see what happens when spin is not involved . for simplicity , we will consider the same system as above , but flip the spin of the wave packet moving in the upper arm when it leaves the `` mirror '' which provides the spin - dependent kick , see fig .",

    "it exhibits discontinuity on the boundary of the overlap area which is an artifact of our simplified model . in this model",

    "8 , which shows interference for @xmath110 .",
    "in contrast with ( [ v ] ) , the calculations of exact bohmian trajectory are more complicated , but for the simple idealized case we consider here , we can get an implicit analytic solution . in the area of the overlap , ( [ rdot ] ) yields for bohmian velocity @xmath111 where @xmath112",
    ". integrating , we get an implicit solution : @xmath113 the solution based on formula ( [ v ] ) is @xmath114 the constants are specified by the continuity of @xmath115 at the boundary of the overlap region .",

    "@xmath117 and @xmath118 are real , so @xmath119 .",
    "the initial conditions for the bohmian particle position are such that the bohmian particle enters the overlap region at time @xmath73 , when @xmath74 .",
    "these parameters define the constants : @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "after an integer number of oscillations , @xmath122 , so , if the bohmian particle leaves the overlap region at that moment , it will continue to move exactly as described by formula ( [ v ] ) .",
    "in fact , this is a general feature which is always valid @xcite .",
    "our calculations , however , show that the approximate and exact trajectories slightly differ when they leave the overlap area .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is our usage of an inconsistent model of non - spreading wave packet with sharp edges .",
    "the inconsistency of the model is transparent when we realize the discontinuity of the wave function at the boundary of the overlap area .",
    "considering the exact evolution of the wave packets eliminates the discontinuity of the wave function .",
    "indeed , the deviation disappears when we consider a gaussian model , in sec .",

    "this exact trajectory makes small oscillations ( of the order of one tens of the wavelength ) about the trajectory calculated using formula ( [ v ] ) and coincides with it when the wave packets are separated .",
    "let us consider now what happens when we add a position detector .",
    "we will start again with detector ( i ) which records the outcome on the bohmian position of a neutron .",

    "we see that with or without the spin , the bohmian trajectory is the naively expected straight line , fig . 7a .",
    "let us consider a spin detector of type ( ii ) .",
    "the measured particle has no spin ( it can be mimicked by a particle with spin that does not change ) , but the neutron has spin .",
    "in fact , that is essentially all it has ; we assume that its spatial state is not changed in the process of measurement .",
    "the wave function of the particle and the neutron for @xmath70 is : @xmath125 the orthogonal spin states of the neutron entangled with the wave packets of the particle play the same role as the spin of the particle in the analysis above . as in the case of a particle with spin",
    ", we get a surrealistic trajectory with a straight line segment corresponding exactly to the formula ( [ v ] ) , see fig . 7b .",
    "our next case is the phase detector ( iii ) , see fig .",

    "the conditional wave function is identical to the wave function of the particle without position detector ( [ psioutnospin ] ) , so @xmath115 is given by ( [ zns ] ) and the trajectory is identical to the one shown in fig .",

    ", the detector causes a minor modification of the trajectory due to the change in the phase of the oscillations , in ( [ zns ] ) @xmath130 , see fig .",
    "so , in both cases we get surrealistic trajectories with small oscillations around the solution obtained on the basis of formula ( [ v ] )",

    "for finding the analytic solution it is helpful to consider this as a motion of a bohmian position of a fictitious `` particle '' in two dimensions , @xmath133 .",
    "we assume that the mass of the neutron equal to the mass of the particle and change the basis to a `` rotated basis '' @xmath134 such that at the region of the overlap the wave function becomes a superposition of two plane waves moving in the @xmath135 and @xmath136 directions , @xmath137 thus , in the overlap , the bohmian trajectory will have constant @xmath138 and oscillations around straight line in @xmath139 of the amplitude @xmath140 .",
    "returning back to the conditional wave function of the particle inside the interferometer , we see that the detector causes a significant change of the interference picture , see fig .",
    "it is obtained for @xmath141 .",
    "thus , the trajectory is even closer to the one predicted by the formula ( [ v ] ) than the trajectory without the detector .",
    "the oscillations are more frequent , but the amplitude of the oscillations , @xmath142 , is smaller by another order of magnitude .      in all the examples above we were able to make exact analytical calculations , either directly with formula ( [ v ] ) or with the exact formula ( [ rdot ] ) . in all cases ,",
    "formula ( [ v ] ) gave either the exact , or a very good approximation to the exact trajectory .",

    "the results of numerical calculations are shown in fig.10 .",
    "first we see that the formula ( [ v ] ) yields good approximation at the overlap area and exact solution outside the overlap area .",
    "we see also that qualitative behavior of the trajectory is the same as with rectangular wave packet shown in fig.8 , the bohmian particle position `` changes hands '' at the overlap region between the wave packet moving at the upper arm and the wave packet moving towards detector @xmath98 .",
    "however , some of the features we do not see : we can not recognize a straight line in the overlap regions with the slope @xmath151 .",
    "the explanation is that the trajectory passes through regions far away from the centers of the gaussians , where the derivative of the amplitude is relatively large in contrast with vanishing derivative for rectangular wave packets . at the center of the gaussian ,",
    "the derivative is zero , so we can expect a better correspondence . to test this",

    "the formula is either exact , or provides a very good approximation .",
    "it allowed us to analyze the behavior of various position detectors uncovering a nontrivial structure in `` surrealistic trajectories '' .",
    "we can put aside the question of applicability of no crossing theorem and just make simple explicit estimation of bohmian trajectories .",

    "we would also like to add a comment on the criticism by hiley and callaghan @xcite of `` slow bubble chamber model '' @xcite proposed by one of the authors a few years ago .",
    "the `` slow bubble chamber model '' is a hybrid of detectors of the types ( i ) and ( iv ) .",
    "the wave packet of the neutron gets a momentum kick if the particle is present as in ( iv ) , but its wave packet is not a constant wave on the ring , but a relatively wide free wave packet .",
    "the kick is weak , so it will take a long time until the kicked and unkicked wave packets separate as in ( i ) .",
    "if the experiment ends before this separation , we get surrealistic trajectories since the slow bubble chamber works as a detector of type ( iv ) . in the conceptual model considered by vaidman @xcite everything in the `` bubble '' was slow ( contrary to a real bubble chamber in which electron ionization happens fast )",
    ". we can strengthen vaidman s argument by using a sg splitting instead of the usual beam splitter , since then the formula ( [ v ] ) becomes exact .",
