    "fe - based narrow - gap semiconductors have attracted considerable attention because of their unusual transport and magnetic behaviors , which closely resemble those of several rare - earth compounds termed  kondo insulators \" . in 4@xmath3-electron kondo insulators such as ybb@xmath4 , ce@xmath5bi@xmath6pt@xmath5 , and",
    "cenisn,@xcite a narrow gap is formed by the hybridization between localized 4@xmath3 and conduction electrons , leading to unique physical properties .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility obeys the curie - weiss law described by the local 4@xmath3 moment at high temperatures , followed by a broad maximum , and is suppressed at low temperatures .",
    "a large seebeck coefficient due to a large density of states near the fermi level was observed in the low - temperature range . in analogy to the 4@xmath3-electron system",
    ", the narrow - gap semiconductor fesi has been intensively studied as a prototype of the 3@xmath7-electron kondo insulator.@xcite this material displays an unusual crossover from high - temperature metal to low - temperature insulator,@xcite reminiscent of the 4@xmath3-electron kondo insulators . in the photoemission experiments , however , the measured electronic structure has no distinct features relevant to a kondo picture and is qualitatively explained within the band calculations by the density functional theory without many - body effects,@xcite puzzling the precise role of electron correlation in the formation of a narrow gap in this compound .",
    "fesb@xmath0 is another candidate for the fe - based kondo insulator,@xcite the crystal structure of which is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "1 . this material shows a unique temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility similar to that of fesi .",
    "the resistivity is well characterized by thermal activation with two energy gaps of @xmath8 30 mev and @xmath9 5 mev.@xcite the novelty of this compound is best highlighted by the colossal seebeck coefficient @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath1245 mv / k near 10 k , where the smaller gap is open.@xcite such a huge value of @xmath10 immediately indicates a novel mechanism , such as the strong electron correlation expected in kondo insulators , which is pointed out by the thermodynamic and optical measurements.@xcite the seebeck coefficient and resistivity , however , are extremely sensitive to the sample quality , and the reported maximum @xmath10 values span from @xmath12500 @xmath13v / k up to @xmath1245 mv / k.@xcite a systematic study of the impurity effects on the transport properties of fesb@xmath0 revealed that the seebeck coefficients are simply related to the carrier concentration doped by impurities , not to the electron correlations , as seen in conventional semiconductors.@xcite    in this paper , we present the magnetotransport study in fesb@xmath0 single crystals , especially for the investigation of its unusual electronic state at low temperatures .",
    "we conduct a two - carrier analysis for the conductivity tensor , which provides us with a proper evaluation of the mobility and carrier concentration .",
    "the carrier concentration decreases from 1 down to 10@xmath1 ppm / unit cell with decreasing temperature from 30 down to 4 k. the small gap of 6 mev obtained from the temperature variation of the carrier concentration agrees well with the previous results .",
    "the mobility reaches a large value of 28000 @xmath2/vs at 4 k , which enables us to observe the large seebeck coefficients even in such a low carrier concentration in fesb@xmath0 . at lower temperatures , the magnetoresistive behavior dramatically changes from positive to negative .",
    "the negative magnetoresistance is generally found in doped semiconductors at low temperatures and derives from a weak localization of carriers,@xcite implying that a similar electronic structure with a considerable impurity level is responsible for the unusual transport properties in fesb@xmath0 .",
    "high - quality single crystals of fesb@xmath0 were grown by a self - flux method using metal powders of 99.999 @xmath14 ( 5n ) pure fe and 99.9999 @xmath14 ( 6n ) pure sb , as described in ref .. the single - crystalline nature was checked by bragg spots in the laue pattern .",
    "the resistivity was measured from 100 down to 2 k. the magnetic field dependence of electrical and hall resistivities were measured up to 70 koe in the temperature range from 30 down to 3 k. these transport properties were measured using a conventional four - probe dc method in the quantum design physical property measurement system ( quantum design , inc . ) .",
    "for the magnetoresistance measurements , we employed the transverse configuration , i.e. , with the current perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "we observed no significant direction dependence with respect to the crystalline axes . for measurements of the hall resistivity",
    ", the magnetic field was swept from @xmath1570 to @xmath1270 koe , and the hall voltage was determined as @xmath16=@xmath17 $ ] , where @xmath18 is the voltage across the hall terminals .",
    "the seebeck coefficient was measured using a steady - state method .",
    "figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity @xmath19 and the seebeck coefficient @xmath10 below 100 k under zero magnetic field .",
    "the resistivity exhibits an insulating behavior , including two upturns separated by a plateau near 20 k , indicating the existence of two energy gaps in fesb@xmath0 , as shown in previous reports.@xcite the seebeck coefficient changes its sign around 30 k and a large value of @xmath20 @xmath13v / k is observed near 20 k.

    "we here analyze @xmath28 and @xmath27 by using a two - carrier model in which one carrier is of high mobility and the other is of low mobility ( @xmath32 ) . in this case , the @xmath26 dependence of the conductivity tensor is described as@xcite @xmath33 @xmath34 .",

    "5(a ) and 5(b ) , we show the 1/@xmath44 dependence of the carrier mobility and the carrier concentration obtained from the fitting for the conductivity tensor , respectively .",
    "the carrier mobilities @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which are obtained independently from @xmath28 and @xmath27 , are in excellent agreement with each other , justifying our evaluation for these quantities within the two - carrier model .",
    "this is also evidenced by the quantitative agreement between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the low - mobility components @xmath39 and @xmath40 from the fitting results are displayed in fig .",
    "the mobility @xmath45 estimated from @xmath39 and @xmath40 is about 25 % of the high - mobility components at 10 k. thus , @xmath46 holds at low fields and even at high fields , and our fitting model using eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is still valid because the contributions of the low - mobility components to @xmath28 and @xmath27 are much smaller than those of high - mobility carriers .",
    "let us first discuss the carrier mobility in this material . as shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) , the mobility of the dominant carriers is about 2000 @xmath2/vs at 30 k and increases with decreasing temperature . at 4 k ,",
    "the mobility reaches a significantly large value of @xmath47 @xmath2/vs , comparable to that of high - purity si or ge semiconductors.@xcite such a large value of the mobility at low temperatures has been also observed in several kondo insulators and charge - density - wave systems,@xcite because of an enhancement of the scattering time due to gap opening .",
    "previous studies of the transport properties have shown a large mobility in fesb@xmath0.@xcite the hall mobility @xmath48 , which is obtained from the hall coefficient @xmath49 and the resistivity @xmath19,@xcite is different from the present results : @xmath50 exhibits a broad peak around 8 k and its maximum value is five times smaller than ours .",
    "this deviation from our results is clearly due to the evaluation method in which only a single band is assumed .",
    "hu @xmath51 @xmath52 . reported a giant carrier mobility of @xmath53 @xmath2/vs near 10 k , which was estimated only from the magnetic field dependence of the hall coefficient within a two - carrier model.@xcite their raw data of @xmath54 at 10 k is , however , much smaller than ours at the same temperature and can be plotted into our data between 30 and 25 k , which implies that @xmath13 is of the order of 10@xmath55 @xmath2/vs . the fitting model used in ref . to evaluate both the carrier concentration and",
    "the mobility is only valid for very - high - mobility electron systems in a nonquantizing low - field range , in which @xmath56 exhibits a strong nonlinear @xmath26 dependence,@xcite incompatible with the nearly @xmath26-linear dependence of @xmath54 observed in ref .. moreover , in the high - field range , the model equation of the hall coefficient does not depend on @xmath26 , and the values of the mobility and carrier concentration can not be extracted independently using this model.@xcite thus , the model might greatly overestimate the carrier mobility in this system .",
    "we next discuss the carrier concentration shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) . with decreasing temperature from 30 down to 4 k , it rapidly decreases from 10@xmath57 @xmath58 ( 1 ppm / unit cell ) to 10@xmath59 @xmath58 ( 10@xmath1 ppm / unit cell ) .",
    "as shown by the dotted line , it is well fitted by the thermal activation function @xmath42 , which yields @xmath60 mev .",
    "the systematic study of the impurity effects on the transport properties indicates that the electric conduction in this temperature range is governed by extrinsic carriers ; the main carriers are excited from the impurity level , which locates slightly below the bottom of the conduction band.@xcite in this picture , @xmath61 corresponds to the energy gap between the impurity level and the bottom of the conduction band . in other words ,",
    "the gap @xmath62 is unlikely to be a gap in the kondo insulators .    below 4 k ,",
    "we could not fit @xmath28 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : sxx ] ) . as seen in fig .",
    "1(b ) , the magnitude of @xmath23 is extremely small compared to those above 5 k , and the negative magnetoresistance is observed around low magnetic fields at 3 k. these behaviors have been widely observed in doped semiconductors in the low - temperature range because of a weak electronic localization.@xcite in the case of as - doped ge , impurity carriers show an electric conduction at very low temperatures , where the thermal excitation into the conduction band is negligibly small .",
    "the carriers are weakly localized by a random potential , leading to a negative magnetoresistance.@xcite the striking similarity of low - temperature magnetoresistive behaviors between fesb@xmath0 and conventional semiconductors suggests a considerable impurity level in the electronic structure of fesb@xmath0 : the impurity level exists slightly below ( @xmath63 6 mev ) the bottom of the conduction band and carriers in the impurity level are predominant on the electrical transport at 3 k.    finally , we discuss the seebeck coefficient @xmath10 with a calculation using a nondegenerate model expressed as @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a scattering parameter .",
    "now we calculate the value of @xmath10 using @xmath60 mev , which is estimated from the 1/@xmath44 dependence of the carrier concentration , and obtain @xmath66 @xmath13v / k at 20 k. here we assume @xmath65 = 3/2 , which is used in conventional semiconductors .",
    "the calculated value is close to , but nearly two times smaller than , the experimental results of @xmath67 @xmath13v / k in refs . and .",
    "an electron - electron correlation is unlikely to be the origin of this deviation because it has an insignificant effect on the seebeck coefficient in an insulating regime.@xcite on the other hand , the phonon - drag effect may play an essential role for an enhancement of the seebeck coefficient in the low - temperature region , as seen in many pure semiconductors.@xcite the phonon - drag term in the seebeck coefficient can be approximately expressed as @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the velocity and the mean free path of a phonon , respectively , and @xmath71 is a parameter which characterizes the relative strength of the electron - phonon interaction.@xcite from the high thermal conductivity below 30 k , a long mean free path of @xmath72 @xmath13 m at 20 k was estimated by bentien @xmath51 @xmath52.@xcite in addition , they calculated the sound velocity to be 3000 m / s . using these parameters , @xmath73 at 20 k is estimated to be nearly 3 mv / k at maximum , which suggests that the phonon - drag effect can yield a measurable contribution to the seebeck coefficient in this material . on the other hand , it is still difficult to understand the colossal seebeck coefficient ( @xmath7445 mv / k at 10 k ) that was observed in ref . within the above description .",
    "we have measured the magnetic field dependence of the electrical and hall resistivity of pure fesb@xmath0 single crystals and analyzed the conductivity tensor by using a two - carrier model to evaluate the carrier concentration and mobility .",
    "the carrier concentration decreases from 1 down to 10@xmath1 ppm / unit cell with decreasing temperature from 30 down to 4 k. the mobility significantly increases with decreasing temperature and reaches 28000 @xmath2/vs at 4 k. at lower temperatures , the transport behavior changes drastically and a negative magnetoresistance is observed . in doped semiconductors ,",
    "the negative magnetoresistance due to a weak localization is generally found at low temperatures , implying a considerable impurity level in the electronic structure of fesb@xmath0 .",
    "the temperature variation of the carrier concentration indicates the existence of an energy gap ( @xmath63 6 mev ) between the bottom of the conduction band and the impurity level .",
    "the magnetotransport reported in this paper strongly suggests that the low - temperature transport of fesb@xmath0 is well understood as an extrinsic semiconductor with ppm - level impurity .",
    "the phonon - drag effect may work , but the electron correlation effect is secondary .",
