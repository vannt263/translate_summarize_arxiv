    "zonal flows can be regarded as a low - frequency spectral condensate phase of the turbulence @xcite featuring the highest flow symmetry allowed by the ( generically inhomogeneous ) system : atmospherical and oceanic zonal jets are latitudinally extended flow structures , and zonal modes in toroidal fusion plasmas appear as average flows on magnetic flux surfaces .",
    "geophysical zonal flows can experience temporal variations and oscillations caused by seasonal or topographical influences , and may migrate meridionally .",
    "similarly , plasma zonal flows in the inhomogeneous toroidal magnetic field are modulated by finite frequency geodesic acoustic mode ( gam ) oscillations @xcite .",
    "the possibility of radial propagation of zonal flows and gams in fusion plasmas has recently attracted interest , motivated by indicating experimental observations @xcite .",

    "finite larmor radius ( flr ) effects in the presence of a background temperature gradient have been identified as one potential mechanism for radial propagation of zonal modes @xcite .",
    "further , it had been postulated that details of the magnetic field geometry , in particular an up - down asymmetry , could cause radial gam migration @xcite .    in the following",
    "the particular influence of geodesic curvature and up - down asymmetry on the radial dispersion of zonal modes is analysed .",
    "a basic geometric property has to be recollected in this context : the flux surface ( zonal ) average of geodesic curvature is zero in any toroidal configuration .",
    "real and artificial geodesic forcing effects on zonal modes are discussed , including the perils of using inadequately simple geometry models that violate this property .",
    "the computational analysis shall here be based on a self - consistent nonlinear model including both the drift wave turbulence fluctuation component and the zonal mode condensate .",
    "radial propagation can best be studied when radial boundary conditions are eliminated by using a periodic domain .",
    "this however excludes the utilization of 3-d flux - tube models , which rely on finite magnetic shear to avoid unphysical flute modes but thereby introduce radial secularity .",

    "<S> phenomenologically a radial propagation of zonal modes shows some characteristics of a classical analogon to second sound in quantum condensates . </S>"
