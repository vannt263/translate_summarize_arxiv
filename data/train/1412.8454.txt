    "cosmological data obtained from different independent observations of sneia , cmb radiation anisotropies , x - ray experiments and large scale structures are well known to point toward the accelerated phase of expansion of the universe @xcite .    the cosmological constant @xmath1 model , dark energy ( de ) models and theories of modified gravity , among other attempts ,",

    "the cosmological constant @xmath1 stands for the most straightforward candidate suggested to explain the observational evidence for it .",
    "the fine - tuning and the cosmic coincidence problems are questions still underlying the cosmological constant model @xcite .",
    "a model for de , motivated by the holographic principle , was proposed @xcite and further studied in @xcite .",
    "the holographic model of de ( hde ) has been in addition comprehensively investigated @xcite .",
    "the hde model has been further employed to drive inflation of the universe @xcite , and considered in @xcite with different ir cut - offs .",
    "for example the future event and the particle horizons and the hubble horizon were considered as well .",
    "moreover , correspondences between the hde model and other scalar field models have been recently suggested @xcite .",
    "the hde model fits the cosmological data by cmb radiation anisotropies and sneia @xcite .",
    "recently , the cosmic acceleration has been also well studied by a promising modified gravity model that has recently attained visibility : the modified gravity chern - simons model @xcite .",
    "the low - energy limit of string theory comprises a correction that cancels the anomalies to the einstein - hilbert action , wherein the chern - simons modified gravity is derived as an effective theory .",
    "gravitational parity violation was first investigated using this framework @xcite , appearing both in 4d compactifications of perturbative string theory and further in loop quantum gravity as well , when the barbero - immirzi parameter emulates a scalar field coupled to the nieh - yan invariant  @xcite . in the chern - simons",
    "modified gravity , the pontryagin topological invariant is well known not to affect the field equations .",
    "thus the so called chern - simons correction consists of the product of the pontryagin density by a scalar field , regarded as either a dynamical evolving field or a non - dynamical background field . in the former case ,",
    "the dynamical chern - simons modified gravity ( dcsmg ) is therefore approached @xcite .",
    "some efforts have recently provided bounds to the chern - simons parameter , accordingly @xcite .    in this paper , we study the many faces of de models in the context of the dynamic formulation of chern - simons gravity , where the coupling constant is promoted to a scalar field .",

    "we prove that both the hde model with go cut - off and the model with higher derivatives of the hubble parameter @xmath2 in the framework gravity chern - simons are related to the modified chaplygin gas models @xcite that further represent the well known models of dark energy as chaplygin gas @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
