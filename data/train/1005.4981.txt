    "planetesimals are super - kilometer sized bodies that are the building blocks of planets @xcite , yet their formation has long been a mystery . millimeter and centimeter sized particles are routinely observed in protoplanetary disks ( ppds ) @xcite , but particles with larger size seem difficult to form by coagulation @xcite .",
    "solids close to meter size further suffer from rapid radial drift due to the negative radial pressure gradient ( rpg ) in ppds @xcite .",
    "the gravitational instability ( gi ) scenario of planetesimal formation @xcite also has difficulties , because even without an external source of turbulence , the kelvin - helmholtz instability ( khi ) generated from the dusty midplane layer prevents the onset of gi unless the local height - integrated solid to gas mass ratio ( @xmath0 , hereafter referred to as solid abundance ) is about an order of magnitude above solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "it was found recently that the drag interaction between solids and gas leads to a powerful instability @xcite .",
    "this  streaming instability \" ( si , @xcite ) results in spontaneous particle clumping from the equilibrium state between solids and gas @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations demonstrate that the non - linear saturation of the si concentrates particles into dense clumps @xcite , promoting planetesimal formation by collective particle self - gravity , bypassing the meter - size barrier .",
    "indeed , @xcite showed that planetesimals with sizes of a few hundred kilometers form rapidly by the si from centi - meter to decimeter sized pebbles and rocks , consistent with constraints from the asteroid belt @xcite .",
    "this letter complements our previous work on the dynamics of particle and gas in the midplane of ppds ( @xcite , hereafter bs10 ) .",
    "we consider a wide size distribution of particles ranging from sub - millimeter up to meter sizes as an approximation for the outcome of dust coagulation in ppds @xcite .",
    "external sources of turbulence such as magnetorotational instability are ignored , as appropriate for the dead zones in ppds @xcite , while si is the main source of turbulence due to particle settling .",
    "particle self - gravity is ignored in our simulations , as we focus on the precursor of planetesimal formation : particle clumping .",
    "the si is powered by the rpg in the gaseous disk .",
    "the rpg reduces the gas orbital velocity ( in the absence of solids ) by a fraction @xmath10 of the keplerian velocity @xmath11 , and is characterized by @xmath12 where @xmath3 is the isothermal sound speed , and @xmath13 is the scale height of the gaseous disk . in bs10",
    ", we assumed @xmath14 throughout , while in reality @xmath6 depends on the parameters of , and location in , the disk .",
    "the strength of the si turbulence scales with the rpg , which in turn affects the particle - gas dynamics in the disk midplane .",
    "in particular , we show in this letter that particle clumping strongly depends on the rpg , which has important implications for planetesimal formation .",
    ".run parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath15 domain size , in unit of gas scale height @xmath13 .    @xmath16 grid resolution .",
    "we perform two - dimensional ( 2d ) hybrid simulations of gas and solids using the athena code @xcite , where gas is treated as a hydrodynamical fluid ( without magnetic field ) on an eulerian grid , and the solids are treated as superparticles , each representing a swarm of real particles .",
    "we model a local patch of the ppds using the shearing sheet approximation .",
    "the dynamical equations are written in a reference frame corotating at the keplerian frequency @xmath17 at fiducial radius @xmath18 .",
    "we assume axisymmetry , and the simulations are performed in the radial - vertical ( @xmath19-@xmath20 ) plane , where @xmath21 is along the @xmath20 direction and @xmath19 points radially outward .",
    "the particles are coupled to the gas via aerodynamic drag , characterized by the stopping time @xmath22 , with momentum feedback included .",
    "the gas is assumed to be isothermal , with midplane density @xmath23 .",
    "vertical gravity @xmath24 is included for both particles and the gas .",
    "the dynamical equations and simulation setup are identical to those in bs10 .",
    "specifically , we consider a particle size distribution that is discretized into a number of particle size bins , with each bin covering half a dex in @xmath25 , bounded by the minimum and maximum stopping time @xmath26 and @xmath27 . in",
    "what follows , we label our simulations with names of the form r@xmath28 , where @xmath29 are integers obtained by @xmath30 and @xmath31 , thus run r@xmath28 uses @xmath32 particle size bins ( or particle species ) .",
    "we use a variety of grid resolution and box sizes to capture the fastest growing modes of the si , and we use @xmath33 particles per species in all our simulations . we assume uniform mass distribution across all particle size bins , with total solid abundance @xmath0 . as in bs10 , we consider four groups of runs , r41 , r21 , r30 and r10 . for each particle size distribution",
    ", we perform simulations with three different values of the rpg parameter : @xmath4 and @xmath34 . according to equations ( 4 ) and ( 7 ) in bs10 ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath6 on disk parameters such as temperature and mass is relatively weak , thus our range of @xmath6 covers a large parameter space of disk models . for each set of runs , we perform a series of simulations with different @xmath0 values , starting at @xmath7 and increasing the value by @xmath35 for each new run , until strong particle clumping occurs or @xmath8 .",
    "our simulation run parameters are summarized in table [ tab : simulation ] .",
    "they are identical to the 2d run parameters in bs10 , but use different values for @xmath6 and a larger range in @xmath0 .",
    "since the natural length scale of the si is @xmath36 , we use smaller ( bigger ) simulation box sizes for smaller ( larger ) @xmath6 values so that @xmath36 is resolved by an equal number of grid cells in each series of runs .",
    "all simulations are run for at least @xmath37 .",
    "three - dimensional ( 3d ) simulation with the inclusion of the azimuthal dimension is necessary to capture the khi @xcite , which is mainly caused by the vertical shear in the gas azimuthal velocity .",
    "our simulations are 2d rather than 3d for two reasons .",
    "first , for our adopted particle size distribution , the turbulence generated from the si stops particles from settling before the onset khi ( bs10 ) , at least for the @xmath14 case .",
    "second , in order to properly resolve the si , relatively high resolution is required @xcite , and particle clumping does depend on resolution .",
    "simulations in 3d with such high resolution are too costly due to the small box size ( thus time step ) , especially for @xmath38 .",
    "the simulations saturate in about 50 - 100 orbits .",
    "particle settling triggers the si , and particles with different stopping times are maintained at different heights determined by the balance between settling and turbulent diffusion .",
    "most interestingly , si efficiently concentrate particles into dense clumps when the solid abundance is sufficiently high ( @xcite , bs10 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : history ] we plot the evolution of maximum particle density @xmath39 for the r30 runs with different values of @xmath6 and @xmath0 .",
    "there is a clear dichotomy in the evolution : either the maximum particle density stays at a relatively small value ( @xmath40 ) , or it reaches as high as @xmath41 , indicative of strong clumping .",
    "a particle clump becomes gravitationally bound when its density exceeds the roche density ( see equation ( 18 ) of bs10 ) , which also is of the order @xmath41 for typical ppds .",
    "therefore , particle clumping is a prelude to planetesimal formation via gravitational collapse . for each value of @xmath6 ,",
    "the transition from non - clumping to clumping is sharp as @xmath0 gradually increases , and we can define a critical solid abunance @xmath9 , where strong particle clumping occurs for @xmath42 . comparing different panels",
    "indicates that @xmath9 monotonically increases with @xmath6 .        to better demonstrate the effect of the disk rpg on planetesimal formation",
    ", we plot the maximum particle density as a function of solid abundance @xmath0 for each group of simulations with all values of @xmath6 in figure [ fig : rpg ] .",
    "the maximum density is taken from the largest value of @xmath39 over the last @xmath43 orbits of the simulations , when all the runs are fully saturated .",
    "we take @xmath44 ( which is the same order as the roche density ) as a rough indicator of planetesimal formation , as shown by the dotted lines . for each value of @xmath6",
    ", one can determine @xmath9 at the intersection of the dashed and corresponding solid lines .",
    "we see that for all four groups of runs , @xmath9 monotonically increases with @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , @xmath9 depends on @xmath6 more sensitively when the particle size is on average smaller .",
    "when @xmath38 , @xmath9 is about @xmath45 for all our four groups of runs . for @xmath46 ,",
    "run r41 does not show particle clumping below @xmath8 , for runs r21 and r30 @xmath9 is about @xmath47 , while for runs r10 @xmath9 drops to below @xmath48 .",
    "particle clumping is a highly non - linear effect due to the si , and is more likely to develop when the average disk midplane solid to gas mass ratio @xmath49 is large . if one assumes @xmath50 to be the midplane vertical diffusion coefficient of the si turbulence , particles with stopping time @xmath51 would settle to a layer with thickness of the order @xmath52 .",
    "the diffusion coefficient @xmath50 depends on the particle size distribution , @xmath53 and @xmath6 . without vertical gravity ,",
    "the only length scale in the problem is @xmath54 , thus @xmath55 .",
    "if one assumes @xmath56 , we obtain by generalizing the toy model in bs10 ( see their equation ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) ) @xmath57 since one expects @xmath58 for relatively large @xmath59 , we see that @xmath60 not only depends sensitively on @xmath0 , as shown in bs10 , it depends even more sensitively on @xmath6 .",
    "this critical dependence makes the average particle to gas mass ratio @xmath49 at midplane quickly increases as @xmath6 decreases , promoting strong particle clumping , which explains the trend in figure [ fig : rpg ] .",
    "the more sensitive dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath6 for smaller particles can be interpreted as a result of the power - law index @xmath61 tending to be more negative for smaller @xmath51 .",
    "our 2d simulations do not contain the azimuthal dimension , which suppresses khi .",
    "nevertheless , we can check whether khi would occur before particles settle into a sufficiently thin layer to trigger strong si by plotting the vertical profile of the richardson number for simulations at critical solid abundance for all @xmath6 values , see figure [ fig : richardson ] .",
    "the richardson number is calculated by the method described in  3.1 of bs10 .",
    "although the richardson number alone does not determine the stability when coriolis force @xcite , and radial shear @xcite are present , one may still take @xmath62 as an approximation for the critical value for instability @xcite .",
    "we see in figure [ fig : richardson ] that for most of these runs , the richardson number across the disk is above the critical value , meaning that the system is kh stable at @xmath63 .",
    "moreover , as @xmath6 increases , the richardson number at @xmath63 decreases .",
    "in particular , for r30 and r10 runs with @xmath46 , the richardson number at the disk midplane drops below @xmath5 , which may be subject to khi .",
    "therefore , the condition for strong clumping for these runs may be more stringent than shown in figure [ fig : rpg ] .",
    "in this letter , we have demonstrated that a small rpg strongly favors particle clumping and planetesimal formation via three effects .",
    "first , for a fixed particle size distribution , the critical solid abundance @xmath9 above which strong clumping occurs is reduced .",
    "second , at fixed solid abundance , strong clumping occurs for smaller particles .",
    "third , khi is less likely to be triggered ( and therefore will not suppress particle clumping ) at @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , a smaller rpg also implies smaller radial drift and collision velocities , promoting grain growth , strengthening our second point above .",
    "a small rpg also favors the gi scenario of planetesimal formation ( relevant when all particles are strongly coupled to the gas ) because there is less free energy available in the vertical shear .. ]    one caveat from our 2d simulations is that the condition for particle clumping is slightly more stringent in 3d than in 2d ( bs10 ) .",
    "therefore , the values of @xmath9 obtained in this letter may be considered as a lower bound . nevertheless , the conclusions in this letter are robust .",
    "in fact , johansen et al . ( 2007 , see their supplemental material ) also found that planetesimal formation is eased with smaller pressure gradient using 3d simulations .",
    "combined with the results in bs10 , we have shown that strong particle clumping is favored when there is : 1 ) a small rpg ; 2 ) large solid abundance ; 3 ) large solid size ; and 4 ) a dead zone .",
    "these results indicate that planetesimals preferentially form in specific locations in ppds .",
    "the global structure and evolution of ppds is of crucial importance : it determines the rpg profile , the radial transport of particles which leads to enhancement of solid abundance in the inner disk @xcite , and grain coagulation that determines the particle size distribution .",
    "recent models on the structure and evolution of ppds ( e.g. , @xcite ) generally show much more complicated structures than the simple mmsn or @xmath61-disk models due to non - steady state accretion as well as the presence of dead zones .",
    "in addition , rpg may reach zero in local pressure bumps at the snow line @xcite or the inner edge of the dead zone @xcite which can also be the preferred site for planetesimal formation .",
    "these results all - together provide useful constraints on the initial conditions for the formation of planet embryos and planets @xcite .                                                    , d.  j.  p. , van dishoeck , e.  f. , wright , c.  m. , maddison , s.  t. , min , m. , wilner , d.  j. , salter , d.  m. , van langevelde , h.  j. , bourke , t.  l. , van der burg , r.  f.  j. , & blake , g.  a. 2010 , arxiv e - prints"
