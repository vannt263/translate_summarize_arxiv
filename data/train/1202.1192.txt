    "over the last decade , experiments at rhic  @xcite and at the lhc ( see preliminary data in  @xcite ) have demonstrated that the fragmentation pattern of highly energetic partons ( @xmath0{gev}$ ] ) is altered strongly when embedded in the dense qcd matter produced in ultra - relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "this is seen in particular in the inclusive high-@xmath1 hadronic spectra that are strongly suppressed by a factor up to 5 ( 7 ) at rhic ( lhc ) compared to expectations from proton - proton spectra  @xcite , and that stay suppressed over the entire high-@xmath1 range studied experimentally so far ( up to @xmath2{gev}$ ] at the lhc ) .",
    "additional information about this jet quenching phenomenon comes from a broad range of jet - like particle correlation measurements  @xcite , and most recently from the observation of strong modifications on the level of reconstructed jets in nucleus - nucleus collisions  @xcite , where first steps towards a characterization of the entire medium - modified jet fragmentation pattern have been taken .",
    "in general , both inelastic ( giving rise to radiative energy loss ) and elastic processes ( giving rise to collisional energy loss ) are expected to contribute to the strong modification of the internal structure of the parton shower , leading in particular to an energy degradation of the most energetic partons as well as effects on transverse momentum broadening and intra - jet multiplicity . however , the qcd - based analytical analysis of jet quenching remains restricted so far to kinematical limiting cases .",
    "in particular , studies of the dominant inelastic process of medium - induced gluon radiation have focussed so far on an eikonal high - energy approximation  @xcite , according to which the energy of the projectile parton @xmath3 is taken to be much larger than the energy of the radiated gluon @xmath4 , which in turn is treated in the collinear approximation with transverse momenta carried by the gluon ( @xmath5 ) and the recoiling scattering center ( @xmath6 ) much smaller than the gluon energy , @xmath7 the seminal analyses of radiative parton energy loss by baier , dokshitzer , mueller , peign , schiff  @xcite and by zakharov  @xcite ( bdmps - z ) are based on this approximation .",
    "this also applies to more recent analytical formulations ( for an overview , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and to those monte carlo models  @xcite that aim at implementing the analytically known qcd - based calculations .",
    "however , jet quenching phenomenology requires an understanding of the interaction between partonic projectile and qcd medium beyond the kinematic range ( [ eq::bdmps ] ) .",
    "it is generally agreed that extrapolating calculations of parton energy loss from ( [ eq::bdmps ] ) to the full phenomenologically relevant kinematical range induces uncertainties that are much larger than other known model - dependent differences  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the analytical calculations of parton energy loss based on ( [ eq::bdmps ] ) show qualitative features that are physically sensible only within this reduced kinematical range of validity .",
    "for instance , they conserve energy and momentum only up to corrections of order @xmath8 and @xmath9 , an approximation that is justified for the range ( [ eq::bdmps ] ) but that can introduce large uncertainties in phenomenologically relevant kinematic regimes .",
    "an analogous conclusion applies to the treatment of recoil effects ; collisional energy loss is negligible in the kinematics of ( [ eq::bdmps ] ) but may be sizeable in phenomenologically relevant kinematic regimes . furthermore , the strong ordering of the energy fractions @xmath10 is an obstacle for treating all daughter partons subject to the same medium - modified dynamics .",
    "also , within existing analytical treatments , the possibilities of studying the dependence of parton energy loss on properties of the medium is limited .",
    "for instance , it is difficult to vary the composition of the medium in terms of elastic and inelastic scattering centers , their hardness and their energy dependence .",
    "many of the above - mentioned limitations arise from the use of analytical techniques and could be avoided if one formulated the dynamics of jet quenching in terms of a monte carlo algorithm .",
    "for instance , exact energy - momentum conservation or the democratic treatment of all partonic splittings are implemented easily in monte carlo approaches while their inclusion in analytical formulations is complicated . also ,",
    "monte carlo techniques enhance naturally the versatility in testing different scattering properties of the medium or in interfacing with different hadronisation models . in practice ,",
    "if one wants to improve the applicability of a calculational framework with monte carlo techniques , it is an obvious prerequisite to establish with which accuracy and in which kinematic range a monte carlo algorithm reproduces by construction a defined calculational framework . with this motivation ,",
    "we have established recently a mc algorithm that faithfully accounts for the dominant medium - induced quantum interference effects present in the bdmps - z formalism  @xcite . in the present work",
    ", we document how results of this mc version of the bdmps - z formalism are altered , when the mc simulation outside the kinematic range ( [ eq::bdmps ] ) is supplemented by various physical requirements .",
    "in the following , the setting in which the mc algorithm reproduces quantitatively all features of the bdmps - z formalism will be referred to as bdmps - z limit .",
    "this algorithm is described in detail in  @xcite . in the bdmps - z limit ,",
    "the medium is simulated as a source of elastic and inelastic scattering centres , characterized by the mean free paths @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the corresponding differential cross sections @xmath13 and @xmath14 with this choice , the bdmps - z transport coefficient that is typically used to characterize the medium reads @xmath15 . here",

    "2 .   _ refined formulation of jet - medium interactions _ + in the bdmps - z limit , transverse momentum transfers are bounded by @xmath18 to ensure a multiple soft scattering scenario . here , we consider extensions that vary the scale and energy dependence of elastic and inelastic interactions with the medium . in particular 1 .",

    "+ the extended mc algorithm will allow for momentum transfers in the extended range @xmath19 .",

    "+ in general , the scattering cross sections can acquire an energy dependence , e.g. due to phase space restrictions .",
    "we consider a scenario with energy dependent mean free paths @xmath20 and @xmath21 as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cut - off dependence of the mc algorithm on the kinematic range @xmath22 $ ] of the gluon energy @xmath4 does not add to the uncertainties of the bdmps - z limit , since it can be absorbed in a logarithmic dependence of the inelastic mean free path .",
    "no overlap of formation times _ + the somewhat surprising finding of  @xcite was that in order to reproduce the bdmps - z limit exactly , one has to allow for overlapping gluon formation times .",
    "firstly , this complicates numerical implementations considerably .",
    "secondly , it still remains to be shown whether the effect of overlapping formation times persists in more complete calculations of multiple medium - induced gluon radiation ( for a first step towards such calculations , see refs .",
    "it is therefore interesting to quantify the difference between an exact implementation of the bdmps - z results , and a simplified no overlap implementation in which only one gluon can be formed at a time .",

    "+ in the bdmps - z limit , one neglects elastic interactions of partons with energy @xmath23 ( since elastic momentum transfers can be neglected in the kinematical range ( [ eq::bdmps ] ) ) , and one neglects inelastic branchings of radiated gluons ( since the calculation focusses on the medium modifications of the most energetic parton )  @xcite . here",
    ", we include both .",
    "it is assumed that the new mean free paths can be approximated by adjusting the colour factors of the bdmps - z ones , @xmath24 scenarios without democratic treatment will be referred to as _ standard _ in the following . subjecting all partons to the same medium - dependent dynamics",
    "may be regarded as a first step towards describing jet - like observables .",
    "it obviously influences the inclusive gluon spectrum and angular distribution , but it also provides additional information for a study of the suppression pattern of single - inclusive hadron spectra .",
    "in particular , instead of calculating the energy loss of the `` projectile parton '' as in formalisms based on the bdmps - z limit , one can now characterise the energy fraction carried by the most energetic partonic fragment in the ensemble , irrespective of whether this fragment is the projectile parton or some of the other ( mostly gluonic ) fragments .    in the following ,",

    "in the bdmps - z calculation the gluon spectrum has the characteristic dependence @xmath31 where the characteristic gluon energy @xmath32 is the energy for which the entire medium acts coherently . in fig .",
    "[ fig::omega ] , we compare this analytical dependence with results for the bdmps - z monte carlo baseline and for the extensions discussed in the previous section . for the mc results in the bdmps - z limit",
    ", the spectrum shows the expected behaviour ( [ eq::bdmpsspec ] ) , albeit with a steeper fall - off towards the kinematic limit .    in general",
    ", enforcing energy and momentum conservation has a negligible effect on the energetic part of the gluon distribution , since the radiation of several very energetic gluons in the same event is highly unlikely .",
    "the soft part of the spectrum , on the other hand , is cut off completely due to momentum conservation .",
    "we understand this by observing that the requirement @xmath33 leads to a minimal formation time @xmath34 since the formation time has to be smaller than the medium length @xmath35 , gluons with energy smaller than @xmath36 can not be radiated arises from the observation that in qcd - based calculations of destructive interference terms , the phase has to become larger than @xmath37 in order for the gluon to decohere from the projectile  @xcite . ] .    if one allows radiated gluons to branch again ( democratic scenario ) , the large-@xmath4 tail of the spectrum remains unchanged since energetic gluons have long formation times , which inhibits further emissions . at very low energies ,",
    "however , the part of the spectrum that was inaccessible in the standard scenario gets populated by gluons that moved into that region by radiating away parts of their energy , see fig .",
    "[ fig::omega ] .    compared to the extensions of the mc algorithm discussed so far , lifting",
    "the soft scattering approximation leads to a quantitatively much more important increase in the number of energetic gluons .",
    "this is so , since a gluon can decohere much faster than in the soft scattering case , when a rather substantial transverse momentum transfer can be given in a single scattering . in the standard scenario ,",
    "the spectrum at low gluon energy is still suppressed , since the condition @xmath38 is a more stringent bound than @xmath39 , which is used in the bdmps - z simulation .",
    "this leads to the suppression of low - energy gluons in the standard scenario .",
    "the shape of the gluon spectrum changes to an approximate @xmath40 dependence at large energies and is nearly flat for small energies . in the democratic scenario",
    "the suppression of soft gluons is overcome by the enhanced radiation leading to an increase in the entire @xmath4-range .",
    "rescaling the mean free paths to take into account their energy dependence leads to a slight increase in radiation around energies below about ( fig .",
    "[ fig::omega ] ) , while requiring that only one gluon can be formed at a time leads to the expected suppression of gluon radiation over the entire energy range .",
    "the size of the effect depends on the relation between the elastic and inelastic mean free paths and is only mild in this example .    in summary ,",
    "the most dramatic changes in the gluon spectrum come from imposing energy and momentum conservation and from relaxing the soft scattering approximation .",
    "we note in this context that there is no a priori knowledge as to whether jet - medium interactions are dominated entirely by soft momentum exchanges with @xmath41 , or whether the @xmath42-tail of hard perturbative processes makes a numerically significant contribution .",
    "both cases may be regarded as corresponding to different , a priori conceivable properties of the dense qcd matter produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the strong sensitivity of the medium - induced gluon radiation pattern to such differences in the nature of medium - induced momentum transfers may be regarded as a phenomenologically wanted feature , as it points to the possibility of differentiating between different dynamical mechanisms of jet - medium interactions .",
    "in the bdmps - z limit , the radiative energy loss @xmath43 is uniquely defined as the energy radiated off the projectile parton and is given by the first moment of the gluon spectrum . it has a quadratic path length dependence characteristic of the lpm - effect . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::deltae ] this behaviour is reproduced to high accuracy by the mc algorithm . in the standard scenario and for sufficiently small medium path length @xmath35 ,",
    "conservation of energy and momentum has only a mild effect on the energy loss , as mainly low energy emissions are affected .",
    "but for larger in - medium path length , deviations from the bdmps - z formalism due to four - momentum conservation are more pronounced . in particular , for medium path lengths @xmath35",
    "that exceed the typical coherence length @xmath44 of the most energetic gluons @xmath45 , the average parton energy loss is known to grow linearly in the bdmps - z formalism  @xcite , while it is bound to @xmath46 by exact energy momentum conservation . here",
    ", we did not explore further this trivial and known effect that sets in only at very large in medium path lengths where it plays an important if not dominant role  @xcite .",
    "relaxing the soft scattering assumption , on the other hand , not only significantly increases the energy loss by enhancing energetic radiation , but also changes the path length dependence from quadratic to linear ( except for very small @xmath35 ) .",
    "the reason is that harder momentum transfers can destroy coherence leading to quasi - incoherent emission of energetic gluons .",
    "energy - dependent mean free paths and no overlapping formation times lead to a slight enhancement and a somewhat bigger reduction of the energy loss , respectively , without changing the @xmath35-dependence much .",
    "when all these extensions of the mc algorithm are included , one finds that the removal of the soft scattering approximation induces the most significant changes both in the @xmath35-dependence and the absolute magnitude of @xmath43 .",

    "this definition is arguably more physical , as a unique correspondence between the initial projectile parton and the most energetic final parton exists only in the bdmps - z limit .",
    "( in general , the most energetic parton may very well be one of the gluons radiated off the projectile quark . ) obviously , the so defined energy loss can not be larger than the energy radiated away by the projectile quark .",
    "this is clearly seen on the lower panel of fig .",

    "[ fig::de - dist ] .",
    "the distributions all fall steeply with a rather significant probability for no energy loss at all . in terms of differences between the different modifications",
    "the results reflect closely the findings discussed for the total energy loss . in the democratic scenario , virtually the only difference between the two definitions of the energy loss is that the distributions with the energy loss derived from the most energetic fragment at some point break off .",
    "this is most prominent in the case without overlapping formation times : here the distribution stops at @xmath48 because it is very unlikely to radiate more than one gluon per event .",

    "fig .  [ fig::kappa ] shows the transverse momentum distribution of radiated gluons in two energy bins for the cases that subsequent branchings of radiated gluons are ( democratic scenario ) or are not ( standard scenario ) allowed .",
    "the transverse momentum is defined relative to the incident projectile s direction .    in the standard scenario , energy and",
    "momentum conservation cuts out the parts of the distribution with @xmath49 , as can be seen in the low energy bin ( fig .",
    "[ fig::kappa ]  ( a ) ) . at this gluon energy removing the soft scattering constraint restricts the @xmath6 range , which shifts the transverse momentum distribution towards smaller @xmath5 values . forbidding formation times to overlap , on the other hand",
    ", leads to an overall suppression without affecting the shape of the gluon distribution much . finally , the sum of all effects is dominated by energy - momentum conservation .",
    "this changes drastically at higher gluon energies ( fig .",
    "[ fig::kappa ]  ( b ) ) . here ,",
    "conservation of energy and momentum and making the cross sections energy dependent has no effect at all on the transverse momentum distribution .",
    "the assumption that formation times can not overlap again leads to a suppression but does not change the shape . in the case without soft scattering approximation , on the other hand , the more energetic gluons can profit from the tail of the elastic scattering cross section and can acquire significantly higher transverse momenta .",
    "this feature is also visible when all modifications are considered together .    in the democratic scenario",
    "the most striking feature is that the distribution extends to much larger transverse momenta .",
    "this is natural as in this scenario gluons radiated off gluons start out with a sizeable transverse momentum relative to the projectile or jet axis .",
    "this effect becomes less pronounced at larger @xmath4 , as energetic gluons are mainly radiated off the projectile quark . in return",
    "another effect becomes visible , namely the smearing out of the peak which has to do with the fact that gluons can radiate other gluons and thus move to lower energies .",
    "again , the most significant modifications compared to the bdmps - z limit result from imposing energy and momentum conservation and from removing the soft scattering approximation for interactions between jet and medium .",
    "the present study documents for exemplary cases how elementary physical requirements ( such as energy - momentum conservation or the democratic treatment of all scattering processes ) and different physical assumptions about the jet - medium interaction can affect the simulation of jet quenching phenomena .",
    "we emphasize that the significant differences between the model cases explored here should not be viewed as systematic uncertainties of jet quenching simulations .",
    "rather , energy - momentum conservation and a dynamical treatment of all scattering and branching processes on an equal footing are clearly sensible physical requirements . to the extent to which imposing these requirements changes the result of a simulation , a simulation without them",
    "should not be regarded as reliable .",
    "this prompts us to conclude that these requirements are prerequisites if one wants to employ monte carlo simulations of parton energy loss for separating between different pictures of jet - medium interactions , such as the two different pictures described in section  [ sec::steps ] .",
    "our study also further supports the argument  @xcite that the bdmps - z formalism ( that does not impose exact energy - momentum conservation and that is restricted to describing the medium - induced radiation of a nominally leading parton ) can not be regarded as a phenomenologically viable approximation for the full dynamics relevant for jet - medium interactions , although it is an interesting , analytically accessible limiting case of the full dynamics of parton energy loss .",
    "the present study also explains how one can understand qualitatively ( and to some extent even quantitatively ) the deviations from the bdmps - z parton energy loss in the high - energy limit ( [ eq::bdmps ] ) induced by imposing the physical requirements listed in section  [ sec::steps ] . in particular , the role of medium - induced destructive interference depends sensitively on the nature of the jet - medium interaction .",
    "harder momentum transfers from the medium can destroy coherence on shorter length - scales and result in quasi - incoherent inelastic interactions with enhanced energy loss and a linear dependence of the average parton energy loss on the medium length .",
    "this strong sensitivity is of significant interest as it may help to constrain the nature of the jet - medium interactions .",
    "our discussion in sections  [ sec3]-[sec5 ] has also identified simple physical origins for the effects resulting from supplementing the results of the bdmps - z formalism with exact energy - momentum conservation , democratic treatment of all partons and no overlap between gluon formation times .",
    "while our study illustrates the insufficiency of a parton energy loss calculation based on the eikonal limit ( [ eq::bdmps ] ) alone , we note that the extension of eikonal kinematics to the full kinematic range is not unique .",
    "thus our study can not provide a _",
    "unique _ solution to the question of how the full kinematical range relevant for jet - medium interactions should be modeled . to achieve a formulation valid in the entire phase space",
    ", one may want to start therefore from a formulation that is consistent with the known results in the eikonal limit , but that does involve neither eikonal approximations nor concepts that are only meaningful in eikonal kinematics .",
    "such an approach is taken for instance in a new version of the medium - modified final state parton shower jewel ( for first results , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) that aside of other phenomenologically wanted features also accounts for the physical requirements listed in section  [ sec::steps ] .",
    "more generally , we hope that the present study contributes to clarifying those physical features that a phenomenologically viable mc simulation of parton energy loss must satisfy .",
