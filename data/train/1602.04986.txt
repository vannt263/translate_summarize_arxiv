    "the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation is the simplest and very efficient tool for describing distribution of charged particles near the macroscopic charged objects in many areas , such as biophysics , electrochemistry , chemical engineering , etc @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the pb equation is based on the mean - field theory that makes its application to real systems quite problematic .",
    "firstly , the mean - field theory itself does not allow us to take into account the effects of the ionic correlations that is crucial for medium and high concentrated electrolyte solutions .",
    "secondly , considering the solvent as a continuous dielectric medium makes it impossible to study the effects of the solvent molecular structure .",
    "these two factors have motivated the researchers to improve the pb equation in the last two decades @xcite . at present ,",
    "great efforts have been made to modify the pb equation with respect to ionic correlations @xcite , the dipole structure of the solvent @xcite , polarizability and permanent dipole of ions @xcite as well as their excluded volume @xcite , the dielectric decrements of ions @xcite , and finally solvent quadrupolarizability @xcite .",
    "most of these researches are devoted to the influence of the different microscopic ionic parameters on the macroscopic quantities of the electric double layer , such as local concentration of ions on the electrode , disjoining pressure , and double layer differential capacitance .",
    "the latter is one of the most important quantities for the electrochemical applications . in a recent work",
    "@xcite we showed in the framework of the field - theoretical approach that if an electrolyte solution is mixed with some strongly polarizable dielectric co - solvent , then the variation of the differential capacitance becomes the greater the stronger polarizability grows .",
    "we also demonstrated that in contrast to the co - solvent polarizability the permanent dipole of the co - solvent molecules only slightly affects the differential capacitance .",
    "moreover , due to the fact that the above mentioned theory described the ions and co - solvent molecules as point particles , the effects of the excluded volume were fully ignored .",
    "however , as was clearly showed by kornyshev @xcite in the framework of lattice gas model , the excluded volume of ions must strongly affects the value of differential capacitance in the region of high surface potentials .    in this work",
    "we continue our theoretical research into the co - solvent polarizability influence on the double layer differential capacitance .",
    "we obtain the expression for the grand thermodynamic potential as a functional of electrostatic potential profile within the density functional approach on the level of local density approximation , taking into account the electrostatic interactions of ions and co - solvent molecules as well as their excluded volume .",
    "we derive the modified pb equation , considering the three - component symmetric lattice gas model as a reference system and minimizing the grand thermodynamic potential with respect to the electrostatic potential .",
    "we apply this equation to the theory of electric double layer , studying the behavior of differential capacitance and local co - solvent concentration on the electrode as the functions of surface potential as well as a behavior of electrostatic potential profile with varying the polarizability and concentration of co - solvent in the bulk solution .",
    "we consider an electrolyte solution containing @xmath0 ions carrying a charge @xmath1 , @xmath2 ions carrying a charge @xmath3 , and a solvent which we shall model as a continuous dielectric medium with dielectric permittivity @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , we consider @xmath5 molecules of a co - solvent which have a polarizability @xmath6 .",
    "to describe the thermodynamic properties of such system , we shall use the variant of density functional theory at the level of local density approximation developed recently in the work @xcite .",
    "the grand thermodynamic potential of the electrolyte solution mixed with the polarizable co - solvent can be written as @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the local dielectric permittivity , @xmath10 is the local concentrations of ions , @xmath11 is the local concentration of co - solvent , @xmath12 is the charge density , @xmath13 is the density of free energy of the reference system ( see below ) .    rewriting the grand thermodynamic potential ( [ eq : omega1 ] ) as @xmath14 and using the thermodynamic relation for the pressure @xmath15 we eventually obtain @xmath16=-\\int \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_{s}\\left(\\nabla{\\psi}\\right)^2}{8\\pi}+ p(\\mu_{+}-q_{+}\\psi,\\mu_{-}-q_{-}\\psi,\\mu+\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\left(\\nabla{\\psi}\\right)^2)\\right ) d\\bold{r}.\\ ] ] thus ,",
    "if the explicit function @xmath17 is known , one can obtain the explicit equation for the electrostatic potential @xmath18 by minimizing the functional ( [ eq : omega3 ] ) . to take into account the excluded volume of co - solvent and ions",
    ", we consider the lattice gas model ( without the attractive van - der - waals interactions between the particles ) as a reference system for which the explicit dependence @xmath17 is well known : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the volume occupied by a particle of lattice gas , @xmath21 is the temperature , @xmath22 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath23 .",
    "therefore , we obtain the following functional : @xmath24=-\\int \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_{s}\\left(\\nabla{\\psi}\\right)^2}{8\\pi}+\\frac{k_{b}t}{v}\\ln\\left(1+e^{\\beta\\left(\\mu_{+}-q_{+}\\psi\\right)}+e^{\\beta\\left(\\mu_{-}-q_{-}\\psi\\right)}+e^{\\beta\\left(\\mu+\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\left(\\nabla{\\psi}\\right)^2\\right)}\\right)\\right)d\\bold{r}.\\ ] ] further , minimizing the functional ( [ eq : omega4 ] ) and using the expressions for the chemical potentials of species @xmath25 we arrive at the modified poisson - boltzmann equation with accounting for the polarizability of co - solvent molecules , their excluded volume , and the excluded volume of electrolyte ions @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the bulk concentrations of ions , @xmath28 is the bulk co - solvent concentration ; @xmath29 is the local dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte solution .",
    "when there are no co - solvent molecules in the electrolyte solution ( @xmath30 ) , we arrive at the equation obtained firstly by borukhov et al @xcite and kornyshev @xcite @xmath31    in limit of the point particles ( when @xmath32 ) equation ( [ eq : pbeq1 ] ) looks as follows @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the local dielectric permittivity in the approximation of point particles .",
    "it should be noted that equation ( [ eq : pbeq2 ] ) was obtained in the recent work @xcite within the field - theoretical approach .      as an application of the modified pb equation ( [ eq : pbeq1]-[eq : perm1 ] )",
    ", we formulate the generalized kornyshev s theory @xcite .",
    "we consider a system containing a charged electrode , which we shall model as a charged flat surface with a surface charge density @xmath35 , the ions of 1:1 electrolyte ( i.e. when @xmath36 ; @xmath37 is the elementary charge ) , and the molecules of the polarizable co - solvent with a polarizability @xmath6 . in this case",
    "the average concentrations of ions in the bulk are equal , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "choosing @xmath39 axis perpendicular to the electrode and placing the origin on it , one can write the grand thermodynamic potential per unit area of the electrode as follows : @xmath40=-\\int\\limits_{0}^{\\infty}dz \\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon_{s}\\left(\\psi^{\\prime}(z)\\right)^2}{8\\pi}+\\frac{k_{b}t}{v}\\ln\\left(1+e^{\\beta\\left(\\mu_{+}-e\\psi(z)\\right)}+e^{\\beta\\left(\\mu_{-}+e\\psi(z)\\right)}+e^{\\beta\\left(\\mu+\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\left(\\psi^{\\prime}(z)\\right)^2\\right)}\\right)\\right),\\ ] ]    since the integrand in ( [ eq : omega5 ] ) does not depend on coordinate @xmath39 explicitly , the euler - lagrange equation has a first integral which determines the condition of the solution mechanical equilibrium @xmath41 where the local electric field @xmath42 and the local co - solvent concentration @xmath43 are introduced .",
    "the first term in the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : press ] ) determines the pressure which is related to the excluded volume of particles , whereas the second and third terms determine the so - called disjoining pressure contribution which is due to the electrostatic interactions @xcite .",
    "further , substituting the expressions for the bulk chemical potentials of species ( [ eq : mu ] ) and for the pressure ( [ eq : p ] ) into the equation ( [ eq : press ] ) , we eventually obtain @xmath44    in the limit @xmath32 we obtain the following equation @xmath45 which was first obtained in the work @xcite .    to obtain the potential profile @xmath46 , we should first solve the eq .",
    "( [ eq : e1 ] ) as a transcendental equation numerically ( for instance , by newton s method ) with respect to @xmath47 at different values of @xmath48 .",
    "thus , we obtain the function @xmath49 . in order to obtain the potential profile @xmath46 ,",
    "we solve numerically the equation @xmath50 with use of the standard boundary condition @xmath51 where the local dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte solution @xmath52 is introduced .",
    "the local co - solvent concentration can be expressed as follows @xmath53    to calculate the differential capacitance @xmath54 as a function of the surface electrostatic potential @xmath55 which is usually an experimentally controllable parameter , we should calculate the surface charge density @xmath35 . for this purpose",
    "we use the first integral ( [ eq : e1 ] ) written for @xmath56 @xmath57 where @xmath58 , and the boundary condition ( [ eq : boundary_cond1 ] ) may be rewritten in the form @xmath59    solving the system of coupled nonlinear equations ( [ eq : e3]-[eq : boundary_cond2 ] ) numerically with respect to @xmath60 and @xmath35 at different values of @xmath61 , we obtain the dependence @xmath62 that allows us to obtain the differential capacitance profile @xmath63 ( see the next section ) .",
    "turning to the numerical calculations , we determine the following reduced parameters : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "we first discuss the behavior of the differential capacitance as the function of surface potential .",
    "the reduced differential capacitance @xmath70 can be calculated as @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "the system of coupled equations ( [ eq : e3]-[eq : boundary_cond2 ] ) can be rewritten in the dimensionless form as @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the bjerrum length .",
    "the first integral ( [ eq : e1 ] ) of the modified poisson - boltzmann equation can be also rewritten in the dimensionless form as follows @xmath77    we use the following values of the physical parameters @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 @xmath81 which yield a set of the reduced parameters : @xmath82 , @xmath83 . fig .",
    "1a demonstrates the differential capacitance profiles @xmath84 for the small co - solvent polarizabilities and the fixed bulk co - solvent concentration @xmath85 . as is seen , increasing the co - solvent polarizability may generate a differential capacitance enhancement in the region of surface potentials less than the saturation potential @xmath86 ( a surface potential at which the maximum of the differential capacitance is achieved )",
    "however , if the surface potential is in the region of electric double layer saturation , increase in the co - solvent polarizability provokes a decrease in the differential capacitance ( see fig .",
    "oppositely , when the co - solvent polarizability exceeds some critical value , its increase leads to a different behavior of the differential capacitance .",
    "namely , increasing the co - solvent polarizability in this case generates a significant growth of the differential capacitance in the wide range of surface potentials ( see fig .",
    "in order to understand these two qualitatively different regimes , let us consider the behavior of co - solvent concentration on the electrode @xmath87 as the function of surface potential @xmath88 at different co - solvent polarizabilities @xmath89 .",
    "2 demonstrates the values of @xmath90 as the functions of surface potential at different co - solvent polarizabilities .",
    "as one can see , at sufficiently small co - solvent polarizability the cosolvent molecules are depleted at the electrode . on the contrary ,",
    "when the co - solvent polarizability exceeds some threshold value , the co - solvent molecules create an adsorption layer on the charged electrode .",
    "these two regimes are clearly demonstrated by fig .",
    "3 , where the co - solvent concentration profiles @xmath91 are depicted .",
    "thus , two different regimes of the differential capacitance behavior are related to the depletion and adsorption of co - solvent molecules at the charged electrode .",
    "figures 4a , b show the differential capacitance profiles at different values of the dimensionless co - solvent concentration @xmath92 at the fixed co - solvent polarizability @xmath93 .",
    "as one can see , an increase in the co - solvent concentration in the bulk solution can shift significantly the maximum of differential capacitance by two qualitatively different manners .",
    "namely , at the sufficiently small co - solvent concentration its increase leads to a shift of the differential capacitance maximum to the region of higher surface potentials ( see fig .",
    "it means that an additive of the small quantity of the polarizable co - solvent to the electrolyte solution prevents the saturation of the electric double layer . in the case , when the co - solvent concentration exceeds the threshold value , the maximum of differential capacitance shifts to the region of lower surface potentials ( see fig.4b ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the dependencies of the saturation potential @xmath86 on the co - solvent concentration @xmath92 at different values of co - solvent polarizability @xmath89 .",
    "as it is shown , the non - monotonic behavior of the saturation potential with varying co - solvent concentration occurs at sufficiently large co - solvent polarizability only .",
    "however , an additive of the co - solvent with sufficiently small polarizability leads to the shift of the saturation potential to lower potentials for all the considered co - solvent concentrations .",
    "it should be noted that non - monotonic behavior of the saturation potential with increasing co - solvent concentration can be of interest to electrochemical applications , where it is necessary to control the differential capacitance .",
    "6 demonstrates the comparison between the differential capacitance profiles obtained by the present theory and our previous theory .",
    "as one can see , previous theory is valid at small surface potentials only .",
    "indeed , accounting for the excluded volume of both ions and molecules of the co - solvent results in a decrease in the differential capacitance in the region of high surface potential compared to the simplified theory of point particles .",
    "the latter means that the dramatic increase in the differential capacitance at high surface potentials predicted in work @xcite is unphysical .    finally , we discuss the influence of the co - solvent concentration and co - solvent polarizability on the electrostatic potential profile @xmath94 . as well as in our previous theory , an increase in the co - solvent polarizability leads to longer - ranged electrostatic potential profiles ( fig .",
    "the latter is due to the fact that an increase in this variable results in higher local dielectric permittivity that , in turn , leads to a decrease in the electrode charge screening .",
    "however , an increase in the bulk co - solvent concentration leads to more complex behavior of the electrostatic potential profile .",
    "namely , increasing the bulk co - solvent concentration at its sufficiently small values makes the electrostatic potential profile longer - ranged .",
    "nevertheless , when the co - solvent concentration in the bulk exceeds some threshold value , its further increase leads to a decrease in the electrostatic potential at all distances from the electrode ( fig . 8)",
    ". such behavior of the electrostatic potential depending on the bulk co - solvent concentration is different on that predicted by our previous simplified theory of point particles , where the potential profile becomes longer - ranged at all co - solvent concentartions .",
    "in this work based on the density functional formalism on the level of local density approximation , we have developed a modified poisson - boltzmann equation with an explicit account of the polarizable co - solvent in combination with the excluded volume of ions and co - solvent molecules . we have applied the modified poisson - boltzmann equation to electric double layer theory and shown that like in our previous simplified theory @xcite ( where all particles of the electrolyte solution were considered as point ones ) , the present theory predicts the influence of the co - solvent polarizability on the differential capacitance .",
    "namely , in the case of small co - solvent polarizabilities under sufficiently small surface potentials of electrode the differential capacitance grows significantly with increasing of the co - solvent polarizability as well as bulk co - solvent concentration .",
    "oppositely , when the surface potential exceeds some threshold value ( which is close to the saturation potential ) , the growth of the co - solvent polarizability and bulk co - solvent concentration results in decrease in the differential capacitance . however , when the co - solvent polarizability exceeds some threshold value , its increase generates a considerable growth of the differential capacitance in the region of the double layer saturation .",
    "we have established that two qualitatively different regimes of the differential capacitance behavior are caused by the depletion and adsorption of co - solvent molecules at the charged electrode .",
    "we have also shown that an additive of the sufficiently strong polarizable co - solvent to an electrolyte solution can significantly shift the maximum of differential capacitance by two qualitatively different ways .",
    "namely , a small additive of co - solvent results in the shift of differential capacitance maximum to the higher surface potentials .",
    "however , when the bulk co - solvent concentration exceeds the threshold value , the maximum of differential capacitance shifts to the lower surface potentials .",
    "we have shown that increase in the co - solvent polarizability results in longer - ranged electrostatic potential profile .",
    "finally , we have obtained that at sufficiently small co - solvent concentration in the bulk its increase makes the electrostatic potential profile longer - ranged . nevertheless , when the co - solvent concentration in the bulk exceeds some threshold value , its further increase leads to a decrease in electrostatic potential .",
    "now we would like to discuss the limitations of the present theory .",
    "it is well known , the lattice gas model highly underestimates the pressure in the bulk at high number densities of particles for the off - lattice hard spheres system @xcite .",
    "moreover , the lattice gas model highly overestimates the differential capacitance obtained by md computer simulations in the wide range of surface potential @xcite .",
    "that is why the lattice gas model can not be used for quantitative predictions of both thermodynamic and electrochemical variables , but only for their qualitative evaluations . to get more reliable quantitative results",
    ", one can use more precise percus - yevick or carnahan - starling equations of state .",
    "however , the application of these equations of state will involve more difficult numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "the next limitation is related to the fact that the present theory is based on the local density approximation and fully ignores the nonlocal packing effects which have a short - range nature and must be important for the ions and co - solvent molecules near the electrode @xcite .",
    "however , we believe that such short - ranged effects could not drastically affect the double layer differential capacitance which should be determined mostly by the long - range correlations of particles . on the other hand ,",
    "the effects of co - solvent polarizability related to the long - range correlations of particles @xcite should be qualitatively described on the level of mean - field approximation .",
    "unfortunately , we can not give an _ a priori _ estimate within this formalism of the results obtained .",
    "the latter requires calculations based on the nonlocal density functional theory or computer simulations . in the present theory ,",
    "we have considered the solvent as continuous dielectric medium with fixed dielectric permittivity . in other words",
    ", we have assumed that the solvent dielectric permittivity near the charged electrode is the same as that in the bulk solution .",
    "however , as is well known , such assumption can not be correct for the sufficiently large surface charge density of the electrode .",
    "indeed , the application of sufficiently large electric field can lead to significant decrease of the water dielectric permittivity @xcite .",
    "that is why our theory gives highly overestimated polarizabilities of the co - solvent molecules @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) for which the discussed phenomena might be realized .",
    "we believe that accounting for the effect of dielectric permittivity renormalization near the charged electrode might reduce the polarizability to the physically reasonable values ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we hope that our self - consistent field theory may be of use for qualitative evaluations in various electrochemical applications .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the present theory makes sense only in the case when the co - solvent polarizability significantly greater than the polarizability of solvent . indeed , only in such case the consideration of the solvent as a continuous dielectric medium at a sufficient distance from the electrode may be justified .",
    "evidently , this condition can be satisfied for the aromatic compounds dissolved in some aqueous electrolyte solution .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to speculate on the possible application of our theory to the experimental systems . in our opinion",
    ", it can be applied to the theoretical description of the aromatic compounds solubilization in aqueous micellar solutions of amphiphilic imidazolium ionic liquids @xcite .",
