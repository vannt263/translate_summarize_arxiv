    "high resolution x - ray temperature images obtained by _",
    "chandra _ of the intracluster medium ( icm ) show that large , cold regions in pressure equilibrium with their surrounding medium are a very common phenomenon in massive clusters ( @xcite , but also @xcite ) .",
    "their high gas density largely compensates for the factor of 1.3 to 4 drop in temperature so that their x - ray surface brightness is still typically higher than the rest of the icm .",
    "the whole cold region is commonly referred to as a `` cold front '' , even if the term would strictly only describe a possible upstream contact interface of the cold gas with the hot icm .    employing the term in its loose sense ,",
    "these cold fronts are extended structures with sizes of one hundred to a few hundred kpc , observed up to a significant fraction of the virial radius ; x - ray maps show that cold fronts are preceded by bow shocks @xcite .",
    "they differ from very dense clumps of gas orbiting the icm which extend to a few tens of kpc at most .",
    "these clumps are much more difficult to observe except in the central regions of clusters @xcite , and they are expected to be the direct remnants of the cores of massive haloes that have merged with the cluster . however , cold sub - clumps would share two similar characteristics with cold fronts : a high x - ray surface brightness and pressure equilibrium with the icm .",
    "numerical simulations have already addressed the formation of cold fronts : in a pioneering simulations of merging clusters of galaxies using eulerian hydrodynamics , @xcite studied cluster - subcluster idealised mergers , and showed that substructure , shocks and adiabatic cooling could result in a complex temperature map .",
    "more recently , @xcite have addressed the evolution of the x - ray luminosity and temperature of the icm in a series of off - axis mergers of idealised subclusters .",
    "they show that the overall luminosity and temperature increase due to merging shocks and regions of gas compression which are observationally unresolved can strongly bias the cluster mass if it is derived assuming a non - merging cluster .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that cold fronts like those found by @xcite can form as a result of massive mergers in a cosmological setting . while both clearly stated that their simulated cold fronts occur when `` the subcluster gas strays from its local potential minimum and expands adiabatically '' they did not explain the process in detail . nevertheless , they pointed out that further observations and simulations need to be carried out to assess how frequently cold fronts may occur in massive mergers .",
    "in fact , massive mergers need not be the only process responsible for cold fronts , but they may be sufficient even at low redshift to explain their observed abundance , all the more if they can remain stable within the icm for a sufficiently long time . in a recent paper ,",
    "@xcite have considered ram pressure stripping as a possible mechanism for forming some of the cold fronts .",
    "they do not include dark matter in their simulations , but study the partial unbinding of a dense clump of gas undergoing stripping from an external , uniform wind switched on at the beginning of the simulation , representing the surrounding icm",
    ". this process may be complementary but is not identical to the one we will focus on .",
    "in the present paper , we study the occurrence of cold fronts as a possible result of a major merger , focusing on the interplay between the dark matter and the gas of the subcluster cores orbiting in the newly formed icm .",
    "like @xcite and @xcite , we follow the late formation of a massive cluster in the cosmology using hydrodynamical adiabatic simulations .",
    "we employ an entropy - conserving dm+sph scheme which is suitable to follow the lagrangian evolution of the flow and the history of the gas of the cold front .",
    "we set the initial conditions to merge two equal mass haloes into a massive , but plausible , @xmath3 final object to more easily bring out the interesting features .",
    "our massive merger takes place at @xmath0 .",
    "it produces by @xmath4 two cold fronts which develop in a 500  kpc thick plane containing the orbits of the two merging cores and expand in the wake of an almost spherically symmetric `` bow shock '' .",
    "this bow shock results from the transonic motion of the merging subcluster cores in the icm .",
    "the medium may have been previously partly heated by a merger shock due to the compression of the gas between the subcluster cores in their convergent motion before their first encounter .",
    "the dense gas cores of the two merging halos survive until close to the present time , when they eventually merge . as the cores orbit in the merger remnant ,",
    "the gas within them is first strongly heated up adiabatically at pericentre by the variation of the gravitational potential due to close encounter , it then cools down partly though not symmetrically between core passage and apocentre as the potential increases again , before it is finally heated up by the final inspiralling .    while a fraction of gas particles of the sub - clumps is tidally stripped at the first closest encounter , both cold fronts form later , at the apocentre of the sub - clumps orbits .",
    "we show that the fronts consist of some of those gas particles initially within the dense cores which can escape out of the local gravitational potential of the sub - clumps . in our simulation ,",
    "the cold front phenomenon takes place as the gas of the dense cores is in slight phase advance relative to the dark matter along the outbound part of the orbit , and phase delay relative to the dark matter along the inbound part . at apocentre in an eccentric orbit , when motions are slower but centrifugal acceleration is high , the overall pressure inside the cluster acts most strongly , in a direction opposite to the gravitational pull .",
    "this introduces differences between the dynamical evolution of the gas of the sub - clump and that of the dark matter .",
    "they are sufficient to result in liberation of gas which has been compressed and heated at core passage but has not cooled down symmetrically since then .",
    "as the cold dense gas leaves the local gravitational potential with high pressure , it expands adiabatically and cools down further .",
    "gas which is expelled in the direction of motion constitutes the cold front .",
    "this gas is not later recaptured by the local gravitational potential of the dark matter subclump .",
    "we confirm that the relatively small fraction of the gas mass leaving the local gravitational potential by this process can make the presence of cold fronts in x - ray images very dependent on the mass of the sub - clumps , if cold fronts are mainly produced by the process we describe here .",
    "we find that the lifetime of our simulated cold fronts exceeds the time required for the bow shock to travel to the virial radius .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : simus ] we present the simulations . in section  [ sec : evol ] we discuss qualitatively the evolution of post - merger physical quantities of the icm as they are directly available from the simulations .",
    "sections  [ sec : shocks ] and  [ sec : coldfront ] tackle quantitative aspects of the development of the two main features apparent on the maps : first , merger shocks and bow shocks , and second , cold fronts .",
    "section  [ sec : physpic ] focuses on one of the two cold fronts , proposes a physical explanation for its origin , and briefly compares to other work .",
    "we summarise and conclude in section  [ sec : ccl ] .",
    "we assume a concordance cosmology with parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 . to study a major merger , as an alternative to resimulating at higher resolution a cluster selected from a low resolution simulation ,",
    "we directly constrain the initial gaussian density field so that it has the usual cdm power spectrum but encapsulates information on where and how the @xmath2 target cluster should form . for this purpose",
    "we use the @xcite implementation of the hoffman - ribak algorithm .",
    "we want an equal - mass massive merger to take place at @xmath9 ; this is obtained if we constrain the initial density field so that it has two gaussian peaks of standard deviation @xmath10 with the same amplitude @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the root mean square value of the unconstrained initial density field when smoothed with a gaussian kernel of standard deviation @xmath13 ) and separation @xmath14 note that constraining the initial velocities of these peaks adds but little control over the final merger at the expense of additional tuning , so we have only used the densities . the above setup results in a very massive , @xmath15 cluster at @xmath2 which follows an nfw density profile , and which formed in an equal - mass merger of two virgo - sized clusters at @xmath16 .",
    "note that @xmath17 is the epoch when the friends - of - friends groupfinder with linking length 0.2 times the mean dm interparticle separation merges the two clusters .",

    "the softening lengths are kept fixed throughout in comoving coordinates .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated with the public version of gadget  @xcitevolker / gadget ] which we modified to include the `` standard '' entropy conservation scheme suggested by @xcite .",

    ", we assume a mean particle mass @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the proton mass .",
    "we do not include cooling , heating , thermal conduction , magnetic fields , nor mechanical or thermal agn / supernova feedback as our focus is the capability of a massive merger to induce large , long - lasting cold fronts even in an adiabatic evolution .",
    "we focus on 11 outputs equally spaced between @xmath17 and @xmath27 , and 3 outputs at @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath2 .",
    "the final virial mass and radius of the cluster , where the enclosed dm density drops to 200 times the critical density , are @xmath30 and @xmath31  mpc .",

    "the size of the region shown is 100  mpc , and the whole box has been projected .",
    "the two massive subclusters merging at @xmath0 infall along the diagonal filament spanning from the lower left to the upper right . once it has formed , the cluster still accretes smaller clumps of dm , mostly from the filament .",
    "the merger occurring at @xmath0 involves two subclusters of fairly similar , virgo - size masses .",

    "while temperature and pressure fully describe the thermodynamics of the gas , both observable as respectively , the x - ray emission - weighted temperature and the compton @xmath60 parameter , the specific entropy , although not directly observable enables one to trace non - adiabatic phenomena like shocks and has become widely used in studies of the icm .",
    "figures  [ fig : fig5 ] ,  [ fig : fig6 ] and  [ fig : fig7 ] show consecutive maps of , respectively , the bremsstrahlung - emission - weighted temperature of the icm , the compton @xmath60 parameter and , following common practice , the adiabat @xmath61 of the gas defined as @xmath62 .",

    "the first four panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] to  [ fig : fig7 ] show how the intracluster gas between the two subcluster cores is compressed and shock heated as they approach the centre from the lower left and upper right corners respectively .",
    "the compression at the centre of the forming cluster is obvious in the temperature maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) where a slab of hot gas normal to the axis of merging of the subcluster builds up and starts to expand .",
    "the top panel of figure  5 of @xcite presents a schematic picture of the first stage of a massive merger that they use to model their _ chandra _ observation of a2142 .",
    "( this picture was first derived from simulations by @xcite and later confirmed by @xcite . )",
    "following their view , the compression we find would eventually lead to the formation of a merger shock . at @xmath67 ,",
    "the dumbbell pattern visible on the temperature maps is a direct consequence of the dense cool cores compressing the hot gas .",
    "note that fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] also clearly shows at @xmath67 the location of the subcluster cores as they host the lowest entropy gas of the map .",
    "note also that the absence of subcluster cores in the @xmath68 panels of the compton @xmath60 parameter and of the entropy ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] and  [ fig : fig7 ] ) is simply due to the two cores being slightly out of the slice chosen for the maps : they reappear by @xmath69 .    in our simulation , merger shocks would take place in the icm as the subcluster gas surrounding one core and carried out in its motion hits the gas of the other subcluster with opposite direction of motion and supersonic relative velocities . at @xmath67 , @xmath34@xmath35 and @xmath37@xmath35",
    "have velocities of order 1700 km / s with respect to the rest - frame of the simulations ( twice this for their relative velocity , see the upper left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) .",
    "the speed of sound in the unshocked icm is of the same order as the velocity of one clump for a @xmath70k icm ( 1530 and higher for @xmath71k ( 2160 shocks are therefore expected to develop ; in the following , we will refer to these pre - encounter shocks as `` merger shocks '' .",
    "we will see that they are difficult to follow as they soon correlate to other phenomena .",
    "the merger shocks expand from the central regions into the icm as the subcluster cores go past one another . at @xmath4 , the fourth panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows the first stage of expansion of the merger shocks , propagating at close to the speed of sound in the icm .",
    "however , as foreseen by @xcite ( see the lower panel of their fig .",
    "5 ) , while the subcluster cores head towards their apocentre , they create new shocks as they move in the central cluster regions where the gas has been previously heated by the merger shocks .",
    "we will refer to this new set of shocks as `` bow shocks '' .",
    "the bow shocks propagate out at speeds set by the bulk velocities of the sub - clumps , when their motion is supersonic , and become pressure waves propagating at the speed of sound when the motion of the clumps in the surrounding icm becomes subsonic .",
    "in fact , they seem to catch up with the merger shocks in the @xmath72 panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] , where they interfere and make a complex structure .",
    "we will consider for simplicity that together they can be described by only one shock wave , and we will not resolve its inner details . in a pattern similar to a temperature annulus , the shock / pressure wave expands up to the virial radius until @xmath50 , and it dissolves later in the far outskirts of the cluster ( igm , filaments ) not seen on the maps .",
    "the birth of the bow shocks is clearly seen in the @xmath73 panel of the compton @xmath60 parameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] ) : the steep pressure rise due to the bow shock appears at the lower left edge of the central light blue zone .",
    "the pressure gradient is visible at @xmath72 and even more at @xmath74 where it clearly delineates both lower left and upper right shocks ( or pressure waves ) .",
    "entropy maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ) mainly trace the positions of the subcluster cores and show how they lose a fraction of their low entropy gas to the central region of the cluster after their first crossing , even before reaching the apocentre .",
    "the entropy rise due to shocks is less visible however , because we expect a small increase due to shocks in the units we express the entropy : a shock with upstream mach number @xmath75 ( 2.2 ) result in a 1 ( 10 ) percent change in @xmath76 .",
    "we will tackle more quantitative aspects of the shocks in the next section .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] shows little temperature variation between the up- and downstream flows ( excluding the broad shock region ) , at @xmath72 and at @xmath74 .",
    "this is due to the adiabatic outward expansion of the gas in the downstream region .",
    "two symmetric cold fronts develop in the wake of the bow shocks : while the bottom left front already becomes visible on the temperature map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) at @xmath72 , both reach their final position by @xmath50 , where they strongly resemble the bow - shaped features of high surface brightness observed in the high resolution x - ray images ( see , e.g. , the top left panel of figure  4 in @xcite ) .",
    "continuity of the compton @xmath60 parameter over the cold fronts is already demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] . the entropy profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] ) indicate that cold fronts are primarily made of low entropy gas , and we will probe the origin of this gas in sections  [ sec : coldfront ] and  [ sec : physpic ] .",
    "note the persistence of a filament of low - entropy gas joining the two sub - clump cores from @xmath74 down to @xmath77 .",
    "this filament traces continuous gas accretion on the central region of the gas particles of @xmath34@xmath35 , @xmath37@xmath35 which have been unbound at first close encounter of the cores and of gas which is gradually stripped off the cores as they orbit into the icm .",
    "the pressure waves keep on extending out of the frame shown on the maps .",
    "their integrity is already broken at @xmath50 but some features persist down to the present day . to the opposite ,",
    "the cold fronts remain fairly stationary and stable on the temperature maps until @xmath29 and only weaken by @xmath2 .",
    "the cold fronts survive the shock preceding them , not only because they stall in their outward propagation , but also because they do not start to `` wash out '' in temperature maps as the shocks do in our simulation on the @xmath50 and @xmath77 maps , even they it can still be tracked later on to larger radii .",
    "therefore , if major mergers are the main cause of cold fronts , their smaller duty cycle will make the bow shocks they are associated with intrinsically more difficult to detect in x - ray temperature maps .",
    "in the meantime , the sub - clump cores merge as they reach their second close encounter : while the pressure maps in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] track the final inspiralling and merging , the entropy maps of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] show a more complicated behaviour .",
    "in addition to the final merging , they show two streams linking the central region to the top right cold front , which develop between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    we stress here that the temperature and compton @xmath60 parameter maps of figs .  [",
    "fig : fig5 ] and  [ fig : fig6 ] have been obtained on a 500  kpc thick slice containing the orbits of the two subcluster cores .",
    "this has allowed us to achieve high spatial resolution and to precisely visualise interesting features . in reality , limited resolution and projection effects will degrade the maps .",
    "recent observations have improved by large factors in resolution ( _ chandra _ reaches 1  , corresponding to a comoving size of 4.6 at @xmath0 ) , but projection effects may still significantly smooth and distort details like those shown on our maps . features which are prominent and asymmetric with respect to the cluster centre like cold fronts may be the least affected , but thin patterns more symmetric with respect to the cluster centre and extending over a larger area such as shocks may significantly suffer from projection .",
    "note also that because x - ray emission is concentrated at the cluster centre , observations of temperatures variations which are weak and/or with small spatial extent far from the centre present a major challenge .",
    "some of the physical processes mentioned above are directly echoed in x - ray observations of the icm .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig8 ] gives the x - ray surface brightness @xmath78 at four different times , over the same , 500  kpc - thick region that was used for figs .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] to  [ fig : fig7 ] .",
    "the panels show a variety of morphologies .",
    "the top left panel shows two spherical , clearly separated subcluster cores at @xmath69 ( in white ) , before their first close encounter . at @xmath72 ( top right panel ) , as they orbit towards their apocentres , the two cores begin to lose a fraction of their gas in their wake , seen as diffuse white emission , and the transition from red to black in the lower left and upper right parts of the image becomes sharper , a direct consequence of the merging shock propagating outwards .",
    "the resemblance of this panel with some of the _ chandra _ pictures discussed by @xcite or @xcite is striking . at @xmath50 ( bottom left panel ) the cores contract , acquire an elongated shape , and fall back in the central potential well , while the external pressure wave progresses towards the outer layers of the cluster .",
    "the bottom right panel ( @xmath2 ) shows what seems a fairly relaxed cluster , but with the clear luminosity gradient of the cold front of the bottom left region .",
    "again , note that projection effects may blur features in the x - ray luminosity which are clearly seen when using a 500 kpc - thick slice cutting through the cluster centre .",
    "in fact , x - ray emission is much more compact and peaked than , for instance , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect measuring the compton @xmath60 parameter .",
    "this becomes obvious when comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : fig8 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] at @xmath72 . in the former ,",
    "the diameter of the inner `` structure '' , taken at a factor 100 down from the peak of the emission , does not exceed @xmath582@xmath35 while the high - pressure zone , at the same dynamic range from the peak value , reaches more than 4@xmath35 on the @xmath79 slice of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] . as a result , the smoothing due to projection will be much reduced in x - ray luminosity maps in comparison to pressure maps .",
    "we have only considered one global shock in the previous section , although complex multiple shocks in the icm are expected to develop during mergers . in fact , the substantial density of the core of our merging subclusters , together with their high infalling velocity results in a variety of supersonic features . according to common lore ,",
    "sph simulations only provide limited shock front resolution . here",
    ", however , the high resolution of the simulation enables us to partly circumvent this restriction and to bring out two aspects of shock propagation that we find particularly striking .",
    "we first focus on the @xmath73 and @xmath72 snapshots , when the bow shock or its pressure wave catch up with the merger shock .",
    "then , we briefly discuss the possibility of secondary shocks .",
    "first , we discuss the primary quantities temperature and pressure profiles across the shock and cold front selected at @xmath79 .",
    "then , we consider the velocity field and entropy evolution as secondary probes .      the broad geometry and sequence of temperature variations remain simple and seem to confirm the picture sketched by @xcite : merger shocks first form in a slab separating the two subcluster cores and normal to the direction of merging as the regions of the gas surrounding the subclusters situated in front of each of them penetrate one another at supersonic velocities .",
    "these merger shocks propagate outwards as pressure waves in the icm once the motion of the subcluster gas in which they originate has slowed down or when the merger shocks have swept up all the subcluster gas and are situated at the interface between the shock heated subcluster gas and the relatively more stationary icm with lower opposite velocity .",
    "bow shocks , on the other hand , are due to the supersonic ( transonic here ) motion of the dense gas cores @xmath34@xmath35and @xmath37@xmath35of the subclusters inside the newly formed icm .",
    "the icm includes contribution from the subcluster gas surrounding the dense cores which has been stripped off by the merger shocks .",
    "as bow shocks can propagate out in the icm faster than the merger shocks or their associated pressure wave if the outbound clump velocity remains sufficient , they can eventually merge with the latter .",
    "the complexity of the symmetric high - temperature regions in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ( see @xmath72 ) suggests that this is the case in our simulation .",
    "the left and right top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig9 ] show the temperature profiles across the lower left shocks at @xmath73 and @xmath72 respectively , while the left and right bottom panels give the compton @xmath60 parameter profiles at the same redshifts .",
    "the profiles show the projected quantities along a test segment reaching from the unaffected icm ( at the exterior of the outermost shock front ) in the bottom left region of the above figures  [ fig : fig5 ] to  [ fig : fig7 ] to deep in the core region of the newly formed cluster .",
    "this line probes the highest temperature zones ( in blue ) of the lower left shocks at @xmath4 and @xmath72 .",
    "note that because these temperature extrema are drifting in the x - y plane , we have taken the test line parallel to the y - axis with the @xmath73 lower and upper end points at ( 43.1 , 48.5 ) and ( 43.1 , 49.5 ) mpc and the @xmath72 lower and upper end points at ( 43.1 , 47 ) and ( 43.1 , 49 ) mpc .",

    "[ fig : fig9 ] is labelled in the global y - coordinate of the simulation ( in mpc ) .",
    "this test line setup allows us to capture all the above features on a straight line .",
    "we note that since the test line is not strictly parallel to the direction of propagation of the shock , this offset will dilate the scale .",

    "the cold front , made of dense particles which are expelled out of the local gravitational potential and further cool adiabatically , makes a large fraction of the 10 percent particles with internal energy below @xmath146 erg .",
    "the additional contribution is from particles trailing @xmath36@xmath35 and leaking to the centre of the cluster .",
    "to properly explain the origin of the cold front during mergers requires to understand how a fraction of the @xmath34@xmath35 particles are able to climb up the local gravitational potential .      on figure  [ fig : fig19 ] ,",
    "we plot in red the positions of each particle of @xmath34@xmath35 in the gravitational potential @xmath131 , while the black set gives the positions of the pressure - selected particles of @xmath34@xmath35 which will have fallen in the potential well of @xmath36@xmath35 ( see  [ sec : coldfront : tracing ] ) by @xmath27 .",
    "as the red set has been overplotted , it can hide black particles .",
    "note also that when a particle belongs to both sets , it appears in red .",
    "the positions shown in abscissa correspond to the y - axis of the simulation .",
    "the right and left panels correspond to @xmath74 and @xmath50 respectively . recall that @xmath36@xmath35 reaches its apocentre at @xmath140 ( see the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "we first describe the two panels in turn and then propose an explanation .    at @xmath74 ,",
    "the distribution of the core set ( @xmath148 mpc ) of the @xmath34@xmath35 particles becomes asymmetric in the gravitational potential which is mostly generated by the particles of @xmath36@xmath35 .",
    "we have checked that this asymmetry is not present ( to this level ) at a previous epoch and that it starts developing at this point . at @xmath149 , in the wake of the gravitational potential of @xmath36@xmath35 centred at @xmath150 , a second , slightly smaller potential well , which at @xmath74 is not yet clearly mapped by particles , starts to be filled up with particles of @xmath34@xmath35 .",
    "this second potential well is generated by @xmath38@xmath35 and captures some of the gas particles of @xmath34@xmath35 which have been stripped off by tidal forces and/or ram pressure .",
    "these two processes would take place when , respectively @xmath38@xmath35 is sufficiently close to @xmath34@xmath35 and when its velocity in the surrounding icm is high enough .",
    "note that a fraction of the black particles have not yet fallen in the local potential well of @xmath36@xmath35 , even if they stay spatially close to it ( see the red particles in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig16 ] for another projection ) .",
    "this fraction also corresponds to red particles surrounding @xmath34@xmath35 in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig16 ] .    at @xmath50 ,",
    "the cold front is already well developed on the temperature maps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] ) , and @xmath36@xmath35 has begun its retrograde motion along y. the distribution of the @xmath34@xmath35 particles in the local gravitational potential is now highly asymmetric ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig19 ] ) , extending from its minimum at @xmath90 to @xmath151 .",
    "particles in the range @xmath152 are responsible for the upper right cold front in the maps .",
    "two other features are striking .",
    "first , most of the trailing red particles stripped off from @xmath34@xmath35 have now fallen back in the potential well of the second halo .",
    "second , the black particles have moved close to their selection location as they accreted in the bottom of the @xmath36@xmath35 potential well , where they are compressed and sustain the equilibrium with the particles of @xmath34@xmath35 forming the asymmetric profile : the pressure selection of gas particles in paragraph  [ sec : coldfront : tracing ] has been done at slightly later @xmath27 . in short , we find that the centres of mass of @xmath34@xmath35 and @xmath36@xmath35 move together after first passage during most of the outward part of their orbit , but that a phase shift is introduced as @xmath36@xmath35 reaches its apocentre : the inward motion of @xmath34@xmath35 is delayed .",
    "similar conclusions have been foreseen by @xcite and stressed by @xcite ( see their paragraph 3.2 ) .",
    "we now suggest a qualitative picture which accounts for the formation of the cold fronts in our simulation .",
    "the effect of the surrounding icm pressure , present all along the inspiralling of the subcluster core , has strong consequences when @xmath36@xmath35 reaches the apocentre . in the following qualitative discussion",
    ", we will first not consider the global pressure gradient of the newly formed cluster , to simplify the picture : we assume a uniform icm pressure .",
    "note that this hypothesis is a better approximation at the apocentres of the orbits of the subclumps , where our cold fronts are generated , than at the inner parts of the cluster ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig13 ] , where the centre of the cluster is at x@xmath582.5 ) .",
    "we further assume that the flow is incompressible , which is valid at the outskirts of the orbit where motions are subsonic . before apocentre passage",
    ", @xmath34@xmath35 stays in phase with @xmath36@xmath35 at least from the time of central passage : the offset between the two centres of mass is always less than @xmath153kpc ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "recall here that first passage of the two subcluster cores occurs at @xmath154 . comparing the red lines ( dark matter ) in the upper left ( x - coordinate ) and middle ( y - coordinate ) panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] between @xmath67 and @xmath74 ( the epoch of maximal x and y extension ) shows that this part of the orbit of @xmath36@xmath35 is inclined to @xmath58 60 degrees anticlockwise in the x - y plane .",
    "after first core passage , the gravitational force acting on @xmath36@xmath35 and @xmath34@xmath35 is central , and is due to the global smooth cluster potential and to the sub - clump 2 .",
    "however , the total force seen by the gas of @xmath34@xmath35 also includes an `` inertial '' pressure force induced by its accelerated motion , which acts in the same direction , but with opposite sign .",
    "this is true even if the surrounding icm pressure is uniform .",
    "( we will employ acceleration here in its vectorial sense . )",
    "because total forces acting on @xmath34@xmath35 and @xmath36@xmath35 differ , this will lead to a decoupling of the part of the gas clump ( the less bound particles ) from the dark matter clump .",
    "this decoupling of the part of the gas clump in turn , is reduced by the gravitational pull introduced by @xmath36@xmath35 as the two components of the sub - clump do not anymore share the same spatial distribution .    because pressure gradients induced by the accelerated motion of @xmath34@xmath35 act opposite to the overall gravitational pull , they tend to eject gas outside of the local gravitational potential .",
    "this liberation of gas is in the outward direction with respect to the centre of the cluster .",
    "it has little effect before apocentre passage because gas particles pushed forward in the direction of motion by this force may immediately fall back in the local gravitational potential of the dark matter subclump , whose eccentric orbit make it pass over the position of these liberated particles .",
    "the potential well of @xmath36@xmath35 will recapture gas particles expelled in the direction of its outbound path in a process similar to the capture of surrounding gas particles of the icm in the later inbound motion of @xmath36@xmath35 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig19 ] ) .",
    "this process will not take place at apocentre though , as the dark matter subclump @xmath36@xmath35 reaches its extremal x and y - position and does not later affect gas particles ejected at this point .",
    "the simulation shows that the restoring gravitational pull that one then expects from the dark matter subclump @xmath36@xmath35 is not sufficient to recollect the gas particles which have been pushed away at apocentre .",
    "this is because gas particles can be expelled far enough from the local potential well in comparison to its depth ( there is more than 0.5@xmath35 mpc between the bottom of the local gravitational potential in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig19 ] ) .",
    "in addition , there is no time for a restoring pressure force to develop , as tracing the high pressure particles selected at @xmath50 ( the black set of points in both panels of figure  [ fig : fig19 ] ) shows that a fraction of the surrounding gas particles of @xmath36@xmath35 , which are not part of @xmath34@xmath35 , rapidly fall back into the local potential well of @xmath36@xmath35 .",
    "this happens as @xmath36@xmath35 moves back towards the cluster centre and pressure equilibrium is again achieved for the gas trapped in the local potential well of @xmath34@xmath35 .",
    "the particles of @xmath34@xmath35 which have been left over in an environment of weaker gravitational potential will quickly expand adiabatically to equilibrate with the surrounding pressure of the icm which is much less dense . in this rapid process ( @xmath155 ) , they cool down from the already low temperature they have as former sub - clump core , and appear as cold fronts in the above temperature maps .",
    "however , the majority of @xmath34@xmath35 particles are not expelled from the local potential of @xmath36@xmath35 : as these particles reach the cluster centre in the second core passage they produce the secondary compression / bow shocks .",
    "we have neglected pressure gradients in this discussion .",
    "pressure gradients will add to the inertial effects which we have focused on and will obviously amplify the phenomenon .",
    "also , ram pressure stripping will contribute to unbinding some of the gas of @xmath34@xmath35 when its velocity is large in the surrounding icm and may also introduce internal motions in the dense regions of the gas which can result in patterns observationally very similar to cold fronts @xcite . because our cold fronts do not develop",
    "when the clump velocity is maximal , and because we do not have sufficient resolution to resolve internal motions in the very core of @xmath34@xmath35 , it seems unlikely that ram pressure effects play a major role are responsible in the formation of the cold fronts in our simulations .",
    "a more detailed , quantitative approach and a precise assessment of the relative importance of pressure gradients and ram pressure stripping compared to the the `` inertial '' pressure effect we discussed will be addressed in future work .",

    "a better , high resolution version of this figure is available at : http://www - astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/@xmath58hxm / coldfronts/. ]      in this paragraph , we briefly put this mechanism in the perspective of similar work addressing the formation of cold fronts using hydrodynamical simulations that has been carried out by @xcite .",
    "@xcite have reached conclusions similar to ours as they considered the development of a cold front in a major cluster merger , arguing that adiabatic expansion of the subcluster gas core as it is freed from its local gravitational potential could lead to a cold front .",
    "we have performed a detailed check of their statement that this expansion is coupled with compression and heating of the less dense cluster gas in forward of the ablated core .",
    "upstream compression and heating are the result of the bow shock induced by the motion of the core .",
    "expansion and further cooling of part of the dense cold subcluster core gas at the apocentre of its orbit lead to the cold front .",
    "@xcite have shown using temperature and pressure cuts through the icm that the motion of the subcluster core gas in the ambient cluster gas drives a shock in front of their simulated cold front during a major merger .",
    "confirming that this shock enhances the density and temperature gradients between the surrounding icm and the cold gas of the subcluster core , they viewed their cold front as that part of this gas which is `` sloshed out '' of its local dark matter gravitational potential well .",
    "we have clarified this part of the picture by tracing back the gas particles of one of our simulated cold fronts . according to @xcite , rapid motion of the cold gas inside the freshly shocked gas",
    "could result in the sharp boundary .",
    "our simulations rather show that the role of sloshing in the formation of the cold fronts is significantly amplified at the apocentres of the orbits of each of the subcluster cores , where our cold fronts develop .",
    "we have also noted that the velocity of the gas flow over the boundaries of our cold front is smooth , confirming the claim of @xcite that the gas of the front appears to be moving together with its surrounding hot gas .",
    "this is different from the contact discontinuity model discussed by @xcite and suggests either that there is not enough resolution in the simulations or that the @xcite picture of cold gas surrounded by a uniform wind of hot gas is not fully appropriate .",
    "@xcite have employed 2d eulerian simulations to study the evolution of a cold gas core as it experiences ram pressure stripping when immersed in a background uniform flow of hot gas ( the flow is switched on at the beginning of the simulations ) .",
    "their cold gas core is assumed in hydrostatic equilibrium in a local , fixed , gravitational potential .",
    "@xcite pointed out that gas motions inside the cold core are mainly induced by two processes : ( 1 ) developing kelvin - helmoltz instabilities , as part of the external regions of the cold gas core is driven downstream , away from the core as well as ( 2 ) the displacement of the bulk of the gas core downstream from the centre of the local gravitational potential because of ram pressure . both processes result in a vortex forming inside the gas core .",
    "this vortex brings low entropy material from the densest parts of the gas core to its upstream boundary , where it can adiabatically expand and cool , leading to the formation of the cold front .",
    "@xcite intentionally employed a uniform background flow , a fixed local gravitational potential , and no global gravitational potential to simplify the picture and focus on the hydrodynamics .",
    "in fact , ram pressure stripping will also play a role in the development of the cold fronts in our simulations .",
    "however , we have presented evidence that the interplay between the dynamics of the subcluster dark matter and gas cores ( as embedded in the global potential well of the newly formed cluster ) might be the essential ingredient to the formation of cold fronts in massive cluster mergers .",
    "recent high - resolution x - ray observations by _ chandra _ have shown that cold fronts are a very common feature of the icm of bright clusters .",
    "cold fronts have been mainly interpreted as a by - product of mergers , yet without any clear - cut description of their physical origin .",
    "we have simulated a late - forming massive merger resulting in a @xmath156 cluster in a concordance cosmological background using a hydrodynamical description that is only adiabatic , but which is suitable to bring out the lagrangian origin of the bulk of the cold fronts .",
    "this sheds light on the details of the formation process of the cold fronts .",
    "we have first shown that high - resolution sph simulations can provide temperature maps of an accuracy comparable to that achieved with state - of - the - art eulerian codes , and can be used to study the formation and evolution of the icm during a massive merger . in particular ,",
    "we have singled out the initial compression of the gas intervening between the cores of the merging sub - clumps as they move towards their first encounter , the generation of two centrally symmetric bow shocks as these cores have moved beyond their first passage , the outwards propagation of the shock together with the simultaneous formation of cold fronts , and the secondary compression of intervening gas before the final merging of the cores .",
    "some of the x - ray temperature maps of the post - merger icm are strikingly similar to those presented in , e.g. @xcite .",
    "we have then focused on the bow shocks sweeping through the icm , noting that they may have interfered with previous shocks developing in the central region of the cluster before first core passage .",
    "we have found that in a 500@xmath35kpc thick slice roughly containing the plane of merging of the two cores , they affect most of the icm and keep on extending from their central generation at @xmath67 down to @xmath2 , first as shocks , later on as pressure waves .",
    "eventually they reach beyond the @xmath157  mpc virial radius of the cluster .",
    "even if they weaken from @xmath50 on , these features can affect the external underdense igm or the filaments and interfere with accretion shocks .",
    "they may significantly contribute to gas stripping late - type galaxies populating the icm , and can lead a fraction of the icm to escape the global gravitational potential as a result of the pressure wave dissipating energy in the outskirts of the cluster .",
    "finally , we have considered in detail the formation of one of the two symmetric cold fronts .",
    "the front develops in the wake of the merger / bow shock as some of the cold gas associated with one of the dense cores of the sub - clumps which has been heated at core passage is freed from its local gravitational potential well .",
    "this occurs as the sub - clump core reaches the apocentre of its eccentric orbit and starts to move back towards second passage .    at this point ,",
    "ram pressure stripping is minimal , but the accelerated motion transforms global pressure into an effective force pointing outwards , acting on the gas component of the clump in opposite directions to the gravitational pull from the clump of dark matter and from the whole cluster . as a result , some of this gas is liberated from the local gravitational well , decouples from the dark matter , and quickly cools as it expands adiabatically to achieve pressure equilibrium with its surrounding .",
    "this process has to be compared to , for instance , the pure ram - pressure stripping effect advocated by @xcite for the formation of some of the cold fronts .",
    "even if ram pressure stripping seems marginal to the formation our two simulated cold fronts , we would like to precisely assess the relative importance of the two processes for cold front formation as a function of the mass ratio between the merging subclusters in simulations including gas and dark matter in future work .",
    "confirming @xcite , we find that the velocity field is continuous all over the cold front up to the preceding shock , down to the resolution where we have sampled the velocity field ( @xmath158 kpc ) .",
    "higher resolution than we have used is needed to address the question of persistence of the cold front interface against fluid instabilities .",
    "while the bow shock / pressure wave keeps on extending , it begins to dissolve at @xmath50 , however our cold fronts remain stable over a longer period , down to @xmath29 when they start to mix with the hotter icm .",
    "we find that they are little affected by the secondary shocks generated at core passage and final inspiralling .",
    "finally , sz polarisation of the cmb combined with the kinetic sz effect has been brought in as a promising tools to constrain the projected velocity of the icm .",
    "we have checked in mock sz polarisation maps that our cold fronts developing on a plane orthogonal to the line of sight do not contribute any significant signal , a consequence of their low bulk velocity with respect to the surrounding icm compared to that of subcluster cores .",
