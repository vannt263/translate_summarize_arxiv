    "recently , there has been a lot of interest in exploring the possible existence of massive compact objects , in particular neutron stars and white dwarfs , based on the theory of stellar structure .",
    "this is primarily because of the observational evidences for massive neutron star binary pulsars psr  j1614 - 2230 ( @xcite ) and psr  j0348 + 0432 ( @xcite ) with masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , where @xmath7 is the mass of the sun .",
    "@xcite examined the possibility of very massive neutron stars in the presence of hyperons and the conditions to obtain the same .",
    "@xcite , based on quark - meson coupling model , showed that the maximum mass of neutron stars could be @xmath8 , when nuclear matter is in @xmath9-equilibrium and hyperons must appear .",
    "apart from the exploration based on the equation of state ( eos ) , as mentioned above , neutron stars with mass @xmath10 were shown to be possible by exploring effects of magnetic fields , with central field @xmath11 g ( @xcite ) , and modification to einstein s gravity ( @xcite ) .    on the other front , the discovery of over - luminous type  ia supernovae ( e.g. sn  2003fg , sn  2006gz , sn  2007if , sn",
    "2009dc ) argues for significantly super - chandrasekhar progenitors , of mass @xmath12 , in such supernovae ( e.g. @xcite ) , which further argues for the super - chandrasekhar limiting mass of white dwarfs as a potential possibility .",
    "mukhopadhyay and his collaborators initiated the exploration of the possible existence of such a super - chandrasekhar limiting mass , first by exploiting the effects of high magnetic fields in white dwarfs ( e.g. @xcite ) , and subsequently exploring the effects of modifying einstein s gravity ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the existence of super - chandrasekhar white dwarfs was shown to be possible many decades back .",
    "ostriker and his collaborators attempted to model magnetised and/or rotating white dwarfs in the newtonian framework in a series of papers ( @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum mass of a non - magnetised newtonian white dwarf was reported then to be @xmath13 , with , however , equatorial radius @xmath14 km ( @xcite ) .",
    "a couple of decades later , @xcite obtained significantly super - chandrasekhar newtonian magnetised white dwarfs , but did not impose realistic constraints on the magnetic fields .",
    "nevertheless , none of them could pinpoint whether there is a limiting mass or not , in the same spirit as the chandrasekhar mass - limit for non - magnetised white dwarfs was proposed ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite showed the existence of a new mass - limit for white dwarfs in the presence of magnetic field , but in the absence of rotation , with a simpler ( constant ) field configuration .",
    "in fact , after the initiation by the mukhopadhyay - group , recently the topic of super - chandrasekhar white dwarfs has been given renewed attention by the community .",
    "nevertheless , apart from magnetic fields , rotational effects also could increase the mass of white dwarfs above the chandrasekhar - limit , as was shown by @xcite .",
    "in fact , in general , a white dwarf could be rotating as well as magnetised .",
    "its angular frequency , however , conventionally , is expected to be much smaller than that of a typical neutron star . nevertheless , in the presence of high rotation , white dwarfs are expected to be oblate spheroids . on the other hand ,",
    "in the presence of poloidally and toroidally dominated magnetic fields , the respective white dwarfs are expected to be oblate and prolate spheroids . therefore , the overall shape of rotating magnetised white dwarfs depends on the relative effects of rotation and the components of magnetic field .",
    "recently , @xcite have explored , using the ( modified ) _ xns _ code , general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) analyses of magnetised but nonrotating white dwarfs and showed that their mass could be as high as @xmath15 . in this paper",
    ", we explore grmhd numerical modeling of white dwarfs , including both magnetic and rotational effects , by using the _ xns _ code .",
    "note that the _ xns _ code is particularly suited to solving for highly deformed stars due to a strong magnetic field and/or rotational effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "although originally the _ xns _ code was developed to investigate neutron stars , recently it was modified @xcite in order to obtain equilibrium configurations of deformed , magnetised white dwarfs . here , we further modify it to make it suitable for deformed , magnetised , differentially rotating white dwarfs .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we briefly mention the numerical approach as described by @xcite . in section 3",
    ", we describe the organisation of the results to be presented in the subsequent sections and chosen basic features / assumptions and units for the work . in section 4 , we discuss the results of non - magnetised , differentially rotating white dwarfs . in sections 5 and 6",
    ", we present the results for differentially rotating white dwarfs having toroidal and poloidal magnetic field configurations respectively .",
    "we also explore the possibility of magnetised , rotating white dwarfs having very small radii , in section 7 .",
    "we finally conclude in section 8 with a summary .",
    "we refer the readers to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for a complete description of the grmhd equations and numerical approach .",
    "our interest is obtaining equilibrium solutions of high density , rotating magnetised , relativistic white dwarfs .",
    "for the convenience , we recall below the equation pertaining to the differential rotation profile chosen in this paper .",
    "stationary configurations can have many rotation laws consistent with the hydrostatic balance condition in grmhd .",
    "one such form , deduced based on the newtonian limit ( @xcite ) , is used in _ xns _ , given by    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is related to the specific angular momentum , @xmath18 is the angular velocity of a local zero angular momentum observer ( zamo ) as measured from infinity , @xmath19 is the angular velocity at the centre of the coordinate system , and @xmath20 is a positive constant that is implicitly related to @xmath19 .",
    "we will refer to @xmath20 as the differential rotation parameter . when @xmath21 , @xmath22 and the system is of uniform rotation . in the opposite limit ,",
    "when @xmath23 , @xmath17 becomes constant in space .",
    "finite values of @xmath20 indicate a spatial variation of angular velocity , and hence differential rotation .",
    "we have grouped the various sequences broadly under three sections  non - magnetised rotating sequences , sequences with toroidal magnetic field , and sequences with poloidal magnetic field .    at the outset",

    "the poloidal field we choose is purely dipolar , having no non - linear current sources .",

    "it may be noted that for numerical purposes , the pressure and density at the surface of the star are not zero , but a small , finite value at which the integration is truncated .    the choice of grid , we have followed , is drawn from the guide to the _ xns _ code .",
    "the angular coordinate varies from @xmath47 to @xmath48 .",
    "the choice of 100 angular grid points appears to be sufficient to capture the variation of quantities with @xmath49 for the models presented here , which have no cusps or other sharp features .",
    "the value of @xmath46 can , in principle , be arbitrarily chosen . however , it is necessary to guarantee that the white dwarf is well resolved over a sufficient number of grid points ( 50 - 100 ) , so this parameter and @xmath50 need be chosen consistently .",
    "our choice of @xmath44 ensures that all the configurations we compute have well over 150 grid points within the stellar surface .",

    "we start with the sequences of non - magnetised rotating stars , focussing on differentially rotating configurations .",
    "uniform rotation has a marginal effect on the mass and radius of the star , except close to the mass - shedding limit .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , uniformly rotating sequences are terminated at low values of the kinetic to gravitational energy ratio ( ke / ge=0.05 - 0.06 ) , by the balancing of gravitational and centrifugal accelerations at the surface .",
    "however , uniform rotation does result in severe distortion of the outer layers .",
    "@xcite arrived at a criteria for stability of rotating stars based on the value of ke / ge , by showing that configurations become unstable to non - axisymmetric perturbations when ke / ge @xmath57 . @xcite",
    "have adopted a similar criterion for stability of rotating configurations , and argued that when relativistic effects are stronger and ring - like or toroidal structures form , the ke / ge threshold reduces to @xmath58 . with this in mind , we have always terminated our sequences at ke / ge @xmath59 , even when the code is capable of converging to an equilibrium solution for higher values of this ratio .",
    "we plan to explore the phenomenon of ` polar hollows ' .",
    "the term polar hollow refers to a change of the density isocontours of the star from a convex to a concave nature , near its poles along the rotation axis .",
    "polar hollows in polytropic stars have previously been reported by @xcite , and investigated in detail for the newtonian case by @xcite . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "not much work has been done on polar hollows in rotating and magnetised stars in gr . in this work ,",
    "we take a first step towards understanding this problem , by computing and demonstrating the plausible existence of equilibrium solutions with polar concavities , for the specific angular momentum distribution profile given by equation ( [ jprofile ] ) .      fixing the differential rotation parameter @xmath20 ( see  2.2 of @xcite , for details of the physical meaning of @xmath20 )",

    "[ fig : roto ] show the development of polar hollows with the increase in @xmath19 .",
    "in fact , the polar radius ( @xmath60 ) decreases , whereas the equatorial radius ( @xmath61 ) increases , with the increase of @xmath19 , as might be expected due to increased centrifugal forces .",
    "this results in oblate structures .",
    "the appearance of polar hollow is due to the differential rotation of the star .",
    "a faster rotation in the inner region disperses the matter to the outer region , making the central region of the star very oblate .",
    "however , the white dwarfs become less oblate in the outer region , with the decrease of rotational frequency , hence develops a polar hollow . for a ke / ge=0.14 , and equatorial angular velocity at the outer surface @xmath62",
    "corresponding to a rotational time period @xmath63s , the mass is about @xmath64  an increase of nearly 29% from the non - rotating case mass of 1.416 .",

    "this may be due to the decreased @xmath61 in the former cases , which allows for faster rotation at the equator , because centrifugal effects decrease when radius decreases for a given angular velocity .",

    "[ polo ] . the radius changes little , due to a cancellation of the effects of rotation and poloidal magnetic field  the tendency of rotation to increase @xmath61 , and that of the poloidal magnetic field to decrease the radius , almost exactly balance each other in the range of parameters that we study .",

    "slow variation of angular velocity in the radial direction , as compared to steep variation , causes larger deformations ( always oblate ) , but less increase in mass .",

    "although both poloidal fields and rotation act in the same way with regard to deformation , namely by causing oblateness , the rotation causes increased size while poloidal field causes decreased size .",
    "if polar hollows are present , increasing the magnitude of the field results in a smoothening out of the polar hollows , due to the possible cancellation of centrifugal pressure and magnetic pressure . furthermore , by increasing the central density and maximum magnetic field , super - chandrasekhar white dwarfs could be shown to be much smaller with the equatorial radius @xmath129 km .",

    "<S> here we extend the exploration of significantly super - chandrasekhar magnetised white dwarfs by numerically computing axisymmetric stationary equilibria of differentially rotating magnetised polytropic compact stars in general relativity ( gr ) , within the ideal magnetohydrodynamic regime . </S>",
    "<S> we use a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic ( grmhd ) framework that describes rotating and magnetised axisymmetric white dwarfs , choosing appropriate rotation laws and magnetic field profiles ( toroidal and poloidal ) . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical procedure for finding solutions in this framework uses the @xmath0 formalism of numerical relativity , implemented in the open source _ xns _ code . </S>",
    "<S> we construct equilibrium sequences by varying different physical quantities in turn , and highlight the plausible existence of super - chandrasekhar white dwarfs , with masses in the range of @xmath1 solar mass , with central ( deep interior ) magnetic fields of the order of @xmath2 g and differential rotation with surface time periods of about @xmath3 seconds . </S>",
    "<S> we note that such white dwarfs are candidates for the progenitors of peculiar , overluminous type ia supernovae , to which observational evidence ascribes mass in the range @xmath4 solar mass . </S>",
    "<S> we also present some interesting results related to the structure of such white dwarfs , especially the existence of polar hollows in special cases .    </S>",
