    "lwa1 ( `` long wavelength array station 1 '' ; figure  [ flwa1 ] ) is a new radio telescope operating in the frequency range 1088 mhz , collocated with the very large array ( vla ; @xmath2  w , @xmath3  n ) in central new mexico .",
    "the telescope consists of an array of about 260 pairs of dipole - type antennas whose outputs are individually digitized and formed into beams .",
    "the principal technical characteristics of lwa1 are summarized in table  [ tspecs ] .",
    "lwa1 is so - named because it is envisioned to be the first `` station '' of a 53-station long - baseline aperture synthesis imaging array known as the long wavelength array ( lwa ) , described in @xcite .",
    "although the future of the lwa is uncertain , lwa1 was completed in fall 2011 @xcite and has been operational as an `` open skies '' radio observatory under the u.s",
    ".  national science foundation s `` university radio observatories '' program since spring 2012 .",
    "the lwa1 radio observatory is currently conducting user - proposed observations supporting research on topics including pulsars , astrophysical transients , extrasolar planets , cosmology , space weather , the sun , jupiter , and the ionosphere .",
    ".[tspecs]lwa1 technical characteristics .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     non - astronomical applications of the lwa1 include study of the earth s ionosphere , meteor ionization trails , and propagation by reflection from aircraft . a vivid example is shown in fig .  [ fjoeh ] .",
    "recent results on ionospheric characterization and meteor trails are documented in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "lwa1 s combination of high sensitivity , large bandwidth , and high time resolution has also resulted in significant progress in the study of jupiter and the sun ; documentation of this work is in preparation .",
    "preliminary examples of work in these and other areas can be found on the website http://lwa1.info .",
    "additional information on lwa1 engineering and science operations can be found at the project web sites http://lwa.unm.edu and http://lwa1.info , and in the lwa memo series , http://www.ece.vt.edu / swe / lwa/. the project web sites also include information on proposal submission , which is possible through periodic calls for proposal , or in some cases by contacting observatory management directly .",
    "interested users are encouraged to contact the authors for more information .",
    "the authors acknowledge contributions to the design and commissioning of lwa1 made by personnel from the following organizations : burns industries , nasa jet propulsion laboratory ( jpl ) , u.s . naval research laboratory ( nrl ) , university of new mexico ( unm ) , university of texas at brownsville , and virginia tech ( vt ) .",
    "construction of lwa1 was supported by the office of naval research under contract n00014 - 07-c-0147 .",
    "support for operations and continuing development of lwa1 is provided by the national science foundation under grants ast-1139963 and ast-1139974 of the university radio observatories program .",
