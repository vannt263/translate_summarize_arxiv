    "@xmath17 can be dissociated by a gluon with energy larger than the quark - antiquark binding energy of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "as the nucleon energy increases , it generates an increasing number of gluons overcoming the binding so that @xmath17 can be dissociated more easily .",
    "therefore , the nucleon-@xmath17 dissociation cross section increases with total energy of @xmath18 and @xmath17 in the centre - of - mass frame .",
    "this is a result of the short - distance approach in which the operator product expansion of perturbative qcd is applied to heavy quarkonia of small sizes @xcite . a similar energy dependence of @xmath19 and @xmath20 dissociation cross sections has been obtained in ref .",

    "@xcite for the dissociation of charmonia in collisions with @xmath16 and @xmath24 mesons .",
    "these quark - model calculations of the quark - interchange mechanism give the result that the cross section increases from a threshold energy for every endothermic reaction from zero , reaching a maximum and decreasing with total energy of the meson and charmonium in the centre - of - mass frame .",
    "this is the energy dependence of the cross section obtained in the quark - interchange approach of the quark potential models @xcite , where the quark interchange mechanism between the two initial mesons breaks the charmonium .",
    "a study of @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 at low energies of the mesons was initiated in ref .",
    "meson exchange between the two initial mesons breaks the charmonium and lagrangians with meson couplings are constructed to describe the motion of meson fields .",
    "this is the essence of the meson - exchange approach @xcite .",
    "effective meson lagrangians with different symmetries lead to different cross sections for the same reaction @xcite .",
    "near threshold energies cross sections increase for endothermic reactions and decrease for exothermic reactions . when the total energy of the two initial mesons in the centre - of - mass frame rises far away from threshold , the increase or decrease of the cross sections is due to form factors inserted in three - meson and four - meson vertices of feynman diagrams .",
    "the energy dependence of cross sections for some hadron - charmonium dissociation reactions in vacuum has been studied in the short - distance , the meson - exchange and the quark - interchange approaches . in hadronic matter not only",
    "the energy dependence is interesting , but also the temperature dependence of hadron - charmonium dissociation cross sections is important @xcite . from vacuum to hadronic matter the quark potential , mesonic quark - antiquark relative - motion wave functions , meson masses and cross sections for @xmath16-charmonium and @xmath24-charmonium dissociation change significantly .",
    "the temperature dependence of the cross sections has been shown to be unexpected @xcite .",
    "for instance , even though a @xmath24-charmonium reaction is exothermic in vacuum , it may be endothermic in hadronic matter ; the peak cross section of any @xmath16-charmonium dissociation reaction first decreases with increasing temperature , but then increases rapidly when the temperature approaches the critical temperature .",
    "therefore , we continue here the study of temperature dependence .",
    "we choose kaon - charmonium dissociation reactions as the first objective of the present work .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross sections for the reactions in vacuum has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , but in hadronic matter it is not available .",
    "the temperature dependence of the kaon - charmonium dissociation cross sections has not been studied either .",
    "it has been shown by experiments that the ratios @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 at midrapidity increase with increasing transverse momentum @xmath31 and the increase is visible only in a certain range of transverse momentum .",
    "for central au+au collisions at @xmath32 gev the ratio @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) measured by the phenix collaboration is availabe from @xmath33 gev/@xmath34 to 1.95 gev/@xmath34 and it is 0.234 ( 0.221 ) at @xmath35 gev/@xmath34 and 0.55 ( 0.55 ) at @xmath36 gev/@xmath34 at midrapidity @xcite . for central pb+pb collisions at @xmath37 tev the ratio @xmath38 measured by the alice collaboration increases with increasing transverse momentum from @xmath39 , forms a peak at @xmath40 gev/@xmath34 and goes to the value 0.45 at @xmath41 gev/@xmath34 @xcite .",

    "the @xmath44 dissociation in vacuum was considered in ref .",

    "however , we will show that @xmath44 dissociation reactions need to be considered in the study of @xmath17 suppression in hadronic matter .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section we present cross - section formulas for the charmonium dissociation in collision with a meson . in section",
    "3 kaon - charmonium and @xmath0-charmonium dissociation reactions are listed , numerical cross sections are shown , relevant discussions are given and the numerical results are parametrized in appendix a. using the @xmath0-charmonium dissociation cross sections and the @xmath16-charmonium dissociation cross sections given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate the ratio of the corresponding dissociation rates in hadronic matter .",
    "a summary is in the last section .",
    "in quark degrees of freedom the meson - charmonium dissociation is expressed as @xmath45 where @xmath46 stands for the up quark , down quark or strange quark .",
    "the flavour of the quark @xmath46 may be different from the flavour of the antiquark @xmath47 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath45 is @xcite @xmath48 is the total spin of either the two initial mesons or the two final mesons , and it is conserved in the reaction ; @xmath49 denotes the magnetic projection quantum number of the total spin .",
    "the mandelstam variables are @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the four - momentum of meson @xmath53 ; @xmath54 is the angle between the three - dimensional @xmath55 momentum @xmath56 and the three - dimensional @xmath57 momentum @xmath58 in the centre - of - mass frame .",

    "( 1 ) stands for the transition amplitude , which takes different values for the two forms of meson - meson scattering , namely , the prior form in fig .",
    "1 and the post form in fig . 2 @xcite .",
    "the scattering in the prior form means that gluon exchange occurs before quark interchange .",
    "the corresponding transition amplitude is @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , represent the products of quark - antiquark relative - motion wave functions in momentum space and wave functions in the colour space , spin space and flavour space .",

    "lattice qcd calculations gave a temperature - dependent quark potential at intermediate and large distances @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the linear confinement in vacuum , the quark potential at large distances is independent of the distance and is a plateau . with increasing temperature",
    "the plateau becomes lower and lower and confinement gets weaker and weaker . from a large distance to an intermediate distance the variation of the potential with respect to temperature gets smaller . at @xmath87",
    "fm the variation disappears .",

    "the potential well fits the lattice qcd results at @xmath88 @xcite and is constrained by perturbative qcd at short distances and the lattice qcd results at intermediate and large distances .",
    "we may adjust the parameters @xmath89 and @xmath90 to get a good fit of the lattice qcd results , for example , reduce @xmath89 by 5% and increase @xmath90 by 10% or increase @xmath89 by 5% and reduce @xmath90 by 10% .",
    "but the changes of the two parameters lead to very small changes of meson masses and cross sections for meson - meson reactions @xcite .",
    "hence , the potential has the uncertainty of the values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 , but the uncertainty causes very small changes in meson mass and in cross section .",

    "( 5 ) is independent of temperature .    from a correlator of a very heavy quark - antiquark pair",
    "a time - dependent potential was obtained in quenched lattice qcd @xcite . only at very large times and at @xmath93",
    "the potential agrees with the free energy in the coulomb gauge . using the free energy from lattice calculations as the potential of a charm quark and a charm antiquark in the schrdinger equation correctly describes the nonrelativistic wave function of @xmath17 and reproduces the @xmath17 mass from the qcd sum rule in the vicinity of the critical temperature @xcite .",
    "when the system s temperature is smaller than the critical temperature , the product of the temperature and a meson s entropy is small or negligible in comparison with the quark - antiquark free energy and the free energy can be taken as the quark - antiquark potential to a good approximation @xcite .",
