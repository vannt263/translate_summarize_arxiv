    "since the beginning of 20-th century the lotka - volterra model of prey - predator interaction is one of the main models for simulation of many processes in population theory and economics . as a rule , continuous models where lotka - volterra equations have ratio - depended parameters are studied ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "logistical and ricker s models are also studied in some works , for example @xcite . in the majority of works",
    "the prey - predator interaction is treated only inside of single region , and no migration from one region to another is considered .    in some works @xcite models with migration",
    "are studied , with a process of migration .",
    "there are also only few works ( see @xcite and references wherein ) , in which discrete models are considered , though in reality such processes are more natural , since they take better into account seasonal phenomena ( reproduction , migration , etc . ) .",
    "the main aim of the majority of works is determination of stable points , bifurcation points , asymptotic behavior , and analysis of model s depending on the coefficients of the equations .    in @xcite synchronization of population dynamics with natural phenomena ( like change of seasons and floods )",
    "is studied . in the work @xcite dependence of population dynamics on population density and migration is studied . in the work @xcite migration",
    "is not assumed to be random , but aims at maximization of some function of the population . at last , in @xcite the influence of stochastic terms in a lotka - volterra model is described , and interesting figures are presented .    in recent works",
    "@xcite salam and takahashi study conflict models , similar to ours .",
    "they introduce important and more complex multi - opponent systems . in @xcite not only conflict , but cooperation between opponents is studied .",
    "the figures , obtained by them , are very similar to figure 3 of the present work .",
    "in this work we construct a model that joins two most rarely studied variants of lotka - volterra model , i.e. , a discrete model with migration . here",
    "individuals migrate not randomly , but according to strategies , discussed in section 5 .",
    "we construct the model of the conflict interaction between a pair of complex systems a and b. the system is a finite set of positive numbers : @xmath7 for a and @xmath8 for b , where @xmath9 means the quantity of parameters that characterize the system .",
    "we study dynamics in the discrete time .",
    "so , the evolution of every system is described by the sequence of vectors with non - negative coordinates @xmath10 for a , and @xmath11 for b , @xmath12 .",
    "the vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 correspond to the moment @xmath15 .",
    "naturally , each system tries to reach the optimal values of its coordinates . in reality , due to the conflict interaction , every coordinate changes in a complicated way .",
    "the evolution of all changes is determined by double dependence : by the conflict interaction between systems ( which we shortly describe in section 3 ) , and by the mutual `` fight '' of coordinates ( of the prey - predator type interaction ) inside every system .",
    "we suppose that every system is complex in the sense that its elements may be treated as one of the types : dominant ( predators , employers ) or dependent ( preys , workers ) .",
    "so , every coordinate @xmath16 may be regarded as the quantity ( population ) of dominant , respectively dependent species at the position @xmath17 at time @xmath18 .",
    "the law of evolution inside of each ( independent ) system is described in section 2 .",
    "we suppose this law is identical in every system and is based on the well - known discrete lotka - volterra equation .",
    "in section 3 we shortly call the main results on conflict interaction between non - annihilating opponents .    in section 4 , that includes the main results of the work ,",
    "we construct a dynamical system describing simultaneous conflict interaction both inside every system and between the systems . the outer interaction is an alternative conflict between non - annihilating systems , whereas the inner one is a prey - predator model of lotka - volterra type .",
    "we may join these two types of interactions in a discrete time .",
    "thus , our dynamical system consists of a discrete sequence of states .",
    "two operations happen at any fixed moment of time : redistribution of probabilities to occupy some controversial positions by opponent systems , and quantitative changes ( namely population ) of all species inside both systems .",
    "the computer modelling of such a complex interaction shows some very interesting phenomena . in this work",
    "we limit however ourselves to present only one observation .",
    "namely , under an appropriate choice of parameters and initial data the complex system oscillates .",
    "we find a rather wide range for initial data for which the population trajectory in phase - space becomes cyclic .",
    "moreover , we observe the stability of the limit cycle , so it is an attractor .",
    "malthus proposed in 1798 the population equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the cumulative number of individuals ( species ) , and @xmath21 are the natural birth and death rates . in reality , one expects exponential solution @xmath22 describes the ideal population of biological species . the exponential rise , if @xmath23 , or decrease , if @xmath24 at most in a local period of time .",
    "verhulst introduced in 1838 a more realistic equation with saturation terms : @xmath25 where the coefficient @xmath26 represents the competition activity of individuals for living resources .",
    "the square power corresponds a conception of an alternative law of access to the living resource .",
    "the solution of ( 2.2 ) describes the @xmath27-shaped logistical curve ( see figure 1 ) and corresponds better to the actual behavior of many population processes .",
    "_ ]    the curve starts with a small value @xmath28 , exponentially increases , and then saturate at the capacity @xmath29    in the economic context , equation ( 2.2 ) can be written as follows @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the capital ( money ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the average gain and loss percentages on the capital , and @xmath34 stands for the coefficient of confrontation between individuals . if @xmath35 , the capital decays to 0 exponentially ; if @xmath36 at the beginning the capital increases exponentially quick , but then the growth slows down , so that it never reaches asymptotic value of saturation @xmath37 .",
    "lotka ( 1907 ) and volterra ( 1901 ) extended the verhulst logistical equation to the lotka - volterra equations intended for the description of amount changes in populations of two species in interaction .",
    "these equations are also known under the name of predator - prey model .",
    "we will refer on lotka - volterra equations in the following form : @xmath38 where all coefficients are nonnegative .",
    "the population of prey is described by the first equation . without presence of any predators",
    "it grows exponentially at the beginning and then comes to the fixed capacity @xmath39 the predators , without any prey to feed on , die out .",
    "when both species are present , the growth of the prey is limited by the predators , due to the term @xmath40 , and the predators grow if the amount of prey available , i.e. if @xmath41 is large enough .",
    "there are many publications devoted to the analysis of lotka - volterra equations ( 2.4 ) ( see for example @xcite and references wherein ) .",
    "the models with discrete time are also studied . in this case ,",
    "equations ( 2.4 ) have the following view : @xmath42    typical behaviour of discrete lotka - volterra model is shown in figure 2 .",
    "@xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath45 @xmath46",
    "in this section we shortly remind an alternative approach to describe the redistribution of conflicting positions between two opponents , say a and b , concerning an area of common interests .",
    "we consider the simplest case where the existence space of common interests is a finite set of positions @xmath47 each of the opponents a and b tries to occupy a position @xmath48 with a probability @xmath49 or @xmath50 the starting distributions of a and b along @xmath51 are arbitrary and normed : @xmath52 a and b can not be present simultaneously in a same position @xmath53 .",
    "the interaction between a and b is considered in discrete time @xmath54 we introduce the noncommutative conflict composition between stochastic vectors @xmath55 : @xmath56 where the coordinates of @xmath57 are defined as follows @xmath58 where the coefficient @xmath59 , @xmath60 stands for the activity interaction . at the @xmath18th step of the conflict dynamics we get two vectors @xmath61 with coordinates @xmath62 with @xmath63 a normalization coefficient given by @xmath64 with @xmath65 the inner product in @xmath66    the behavior of the state @xmath67 at time @xmath68 for @xmath69 has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "we shortly describe the results .",
    "* theorem.1 . * _ for any pair of non - orthogonal stochastic vectors @xmath70 @xmath71 , and fixed interaction intensivity parameter @xmath60 , @xmath72 with condition @xmath73 , the sequence of states @xmath67 tends to the limit state @xmath74 @xmath75 this limit state is invariant with respect to the conflict interaction : @xmath76 moreover , @xmath77 _    we emphasize that in the case of a purely repulsive interaction , @xmath78 if the starting distributions are different , then the limiting vectors are orthogonal",
    ". therefore each of the vectors @xmath79 contains by necessity some amount of zero coordinates on different positions @xmath53 .",
    "for example the typical limiting picture for @xmath80 is presented in figure 3 ( comp . with @xcite ) .    ]",
    "@xmath81    if we start with a pair of identical vectors , @xmath82 , then @xmath83 too .",
    "that is , all non - zero coordinates of the limiting vectors are equal .    in the general case , @xmath84 the coordinates @xmath85 have at most several oscillations and then reach monotonically their positive or zero limits . the limiting values @xmath86 may be described in terms of starting states .",
    "given a couple of stochastic vectors @xmath87 , define @xmath88 where @xmath89    obviously @xmath90 since @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "* remark . * from ( [ result_p ] )",
    "it follows that any transformation @xmath93 , which does not change the values @xmath94 and @xmath95 , preserves the same limiting distribution as for the vectors @xmath96 .",
    "a class of such transformations may be presented by a shift transformation of coordinates , @xmath97 with appropriated @xmath98 .    in the case @xmath99 of the pure attractive interaction we have another limiting distribution .",

    "* _ in the purely attractive case , @xmath102 , the limiting vectors @xmath103 are equal and their coordinates have the following distributions : @xmath104 where @xmath105 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath106 .",
    "_    in general , it is an open question to give a complete characterization of @xmath107 .",
    "below we present several sufficient conditions for @xmath108 to belong to the set @xmath109 .",
    "simultaneously these conditions give some characterization for the points to be in @xmath106 .",
    "we will use the following notations : @xmath110    . _",
    "if @xmath111 then @xmath112 and therefore @xmath113 _    _ proof .",
    "_ by ( [ result_par ] ) we have @xmath114 where we recall that @xmath115 therefore each of the conditions ( [ result_pan ] ) implies that @xmath116 .",
    "further , since @xmath117 again from ( [ result_pan ] ) it also follows that @xmath118 thus , by induction , @xmath119 and @xmath120 for all @xmath121    or , in other words , @xmath122 @xmath123    thus , sequences of the ratios @xmath124 are monotone increasing as @xmath125 assume for a moment that there exists a finite limit , @xmath126 this is only possible if @xmath127 which contradicts ( [ result_paq ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath128 and therefore @xmath129 , as well as @xmath130 @xmath131    let us consider now the critical situation , when for a fixed pair of indices , say @xmath17 and @xmath108 , the values @xmath132 , @xmath133 have opposite signs , for example , @xmath134 ,  @xmath135 .",
    "in such a case it is not clear what behavior the coordinates @xmath136 and @xmath137 will have when @xmath138 .",
    "we will show that the limits depend on which of the two values , @xmath139 or @xmath140 , is larger .",
    "moreover we will show that even if @xmath141 is the largest coordinate , it may happen that @xmath129 .",
    "let for example , @xmath142 and @xmath143 however the value of @xmath144 is such that @xmath145  then under some additional condition it is possible to have @xmath129 .",
    "in fact we have :       _ proof .",
    "_ we will show that ( [ c1 ] ) , ( [ c2 ] ) , and ( [ c3 ] ) imply @xmath146 and @xmath147 then ( [ r3 ] ) follows from proposition 1",
    ". in reality ( [ r4 ] ) follows from ( [ c3 ] ) directly , without condition ( [ c2 ] ) .",
    "so , we have only to prove ( [ r5 ] ) .    with this aim",
    "we find the representation for @xmath148 in terms @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",

    "thus @xmath158 i.e. , ( [ r5 ] ) is true .",
    "@xmath131    we stress that ( [ r3 ] ) is true in spite of @xmath159 . of course , if @xmath160 and @xmath161 , then ( [ r3 ] ) holds without any additional condition of the form ( [ c3 ] ) .",
    "in this section we construct a dynamical model of conflict interaction between a pair of complex systems .",
    "each of the systems is subjected to the inner conflict between their elements . for simplicity , we assume both systems to be similar and described by discrete prey - predator models of type ( 2.5 ) .",
    "we introduce the conflict interaction between these systems using an approach developed in @xcite .",
    "with such a rather complex situation we may obtain a wide spectrum of evolutions . in this work we study qualitative characteristics of the behavior of corresponding dynamical systems for some choice of parameters @xmath162 ( see ( 2.5 ) , ( 3.1 ) ) and values of initial populations of species @xmath163 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath164 , that shows intensity of the interaction between systems , has an important effect .",
    "the increasing @xmath164 from zero to unit causes the appearance of a series of bifurcations .",
    "for @xmath165 we have two copies of independent lotka - volterra models . for small values of @xmath164",
    "both systems behave like pure lotka - volterra systems , coming them to a stable state .    under fixed parameters and",
    "the starting coordinates @xmath166 we have first bifurcation point at @xmath167 .",
    "the coordinates @xmath168 oscillate and a cycle of a small period appears .    the following increase of @xmath164 shows the appearance of new bifurcation points that are characterized by an increasing value of the cyclic period . for the value @xmath169 a cycle of infinite period appears .",
    "this means that all coordinates rapidly reach the stable state . in this case",
    "some species may disappear , even if they had some stable positive values in a pure ( @xmath165 ) lotka - volterra model .",
    "the role of the coefficients @xmath170 and initial quantity of the species @xmath163 in a pure lotka - volterra model is well - known and described ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "partially , coefficients @xmath171 govern the increase of the pray population when predators are absent and the predator population decreasing when prays are absent . in turn , the coefficients @xmath172 are responsible respectively for the pray quantity decreasing with an increasing number of predators , and increase of the predator population with an increase of the number of prays .",
    "the last coefficients in each of the equations give the limitation of increasing of both populations .",
    "in other words , each population `` makes pressure '' on itself , it does not permit an infinite reproducibility .",
    "questions about stable points , orbits , asymptotic behavior of orbits are well described for the classical lotka - volterra model .",
    "we shall recall that usually there are at least three equilibrium points .",
    "they are refereed in literature as follows ( see , e.g. @xcite ) :    \\(1 ) trivial ( 0,0 ) ;    \\(2 ) axial ( @xmath173,0 ) ;    \\(3 ) inner positive @xmath174    an equilibrium point is called stable point if after a sudden change of population it comes back to an equilibrium point some time later .",
    "this may happen monotonically , or with some oscillations .",
    "we should note that under the existence of stable points the behavior of the system is well defined by coefficients @xmath170 .",
    "but under the absence of stable points , the behavior of the system is defined by the initial data @xmath163 .",
    "depending on how close the initial data are situated with respect to the equilibrium point , the system may evaluate in a different way .",
    "the role of all these coefficients is preserved in the case of our model .",
    "but now their influence is much more complex .",
    "we present here only first steps in this direction .",
    "we shall discuss not only stability zones , as it was pointed above , but also the values of the coefficients for which the system oscillates along some closed cycles .",
    "the state of our dynamical system is fixed by a pair of vectors @xmath175 @xmath176 with non - negative coefficients , where @xmath177 denotes the discrete time , @xmath178 stands for the number of conflict positions .",
    "here we study the most simple situation , when every system consists of only two agents : pray and predator , i.e. @xmath179 .",
    "the complex conflict transformation is denoted by the mapping @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the composition of four operations , the specific mathematical transformations : @xmath182u.$ ]    let us describe them in an explicit form for the first step .    the first operation @xmath183 describes the interaction between elements inside",
    "every system separately according to the pray - predator model . corresponding mathematical transformation of vectors ( the interaction composition ) @xmath184 is described by the system of equations of the form ( 2.5 ) : @xmath185 and @xmath186 where the passage to new values of coordinates is pointed by tilde , but not by changing of upper index , likely to ( 2.5 ) .",
    "the following operation involves the interaction @xmath187 ( see ( 3.1 ) ) between previous systems according to the theory of the alternative conflict for non - annihilating opponents ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . to describe this operation we at first have to normalize the vectors @xmath188 , i.e. , to work with stochastic vectors .",
    "we use the following notation for normalization : @xmath189 where the coordinates of the stochastic vectors @xmath190 are determined by formulae @xmath191 where @xmath192    the next step exactly corresponds to the conflict interaction between systems .",
    "we introduce new stochastic vectors @xmath193 with coordinates : @xmath194    finally , we have to come back to the non - normalized vectors , which characterize quantitatively populations in both regions after inner and outer conflicts operations .",
    "so , at time @xmath195 we have the following vectors @xmath196 , where @xmath197 and where @xmath198    we can repeat this procedure starting from @xmath199 .",
    "so we get @xmath200 .",
    "and so on for any @xmath18th step .    to find the equilibrium points in the case of the complex conflict interaction described above",
    ", we have to solve the following system of equations for @xmath201 : @xmath202 where @xmath203 @xmath204 @xmath205 @xmath206.\\ ] ]    we note that in the case @xmath165 we have two copies of pure lotka - volterra models and the corresponding system of equations has at least three equilibrium points ( trivial , axial , inner positive ) .    for the case",
    "@xmath60 it is difficult to obtain exact solutions .",
    "let us obtain some insights by numerical approximation .",
    "partially , we found that there exist equilibrium points and the limit cycles for a wide set of parameter values and initial data ( see figure 4 - 7 ) .",
    "_ amplitude .",
    "@xmath207 the conflict interaction coefficient _",
    "@xmath210    . _ ]        _ between lotka - volterra systems after 70000 steps of iteration .",
    "_     after _ ]    _ 70000 steps of iteration .",
    "the unstable equilibrium point is shown . _    moreover , we established the shift effect for the equilibrium point .",
    "namely , we observe that the inner positive equilibrium point ( it exist in any system and may be found by formula ( 4.1 ) ) is shifted after the application of the conflict interaction between systems .",
    "we see by ( 4.1 ) that stabilization of discrete lotka - volterra model with parameters @xmath211 occurs when @xmath212 this may be easily verified by putting these initial data into corresponding equations . in this case",
    "we have trivial dynamics .",
    "let us consider the case of discrete lotka - volterra model with the conflict interaction between systems .",
    "we take the values of the coefficients @xmath213 . now",
    "the equilibrium point has the coordinates @xmath214 the dynamics is constant with these initial data .    in case of larger @xmath164 ,",
    "when oscillations appear , the equilibrium point may also be easily found if we put the initial data in both systems to be equal . in this case",
    "the behavior is like in the case of a pure lotka - volterra model , and stabilization occurs .",
    "however , the stable point is shifted , for example , when @xmath215 ( see figure 4 - 7 ) the equilibrium point is @xmath216    thus , if we have some pray - predator system and want to change the population inside this system , we may create an analogous `` artificial '' system , introduce the conflict interaction and obtain the desired shift of the equilibrium point .",
    "apparently a stronger shift of the stable equilibrium point in the case of an `` ensemble '' of larger amount of lotka - volterra systems .",
    "so , we observed the interesting phenomenon : the equilibrium point of an isolated system is shifted if we come to the case when identical systems are united as an `` ensemble '' .",
    "however , this equilibrium point is unstable , any perturbation of initial data causes the receding of the system from the equilibrium point .",
    "one of more interesting observations concerns the limit cycles .",
    "it is known that no such kind of orbits in discrete lotka - volterra model is possible .",
    "but under the effect of the outer conflict , as we see at the pictures , the dynamical system reaches the limit cycle starting both from an inside or outside point with respect to the orbit .",
    "partially , in figure 10,11 we present the model , that starts at @xmath217 . as it was pointed above , in case of a pure lotka - volterra model , with these initial data",
    "there is no dynamics .",
    "however , in the case of the model with the outer conflict the process tends to a limit cycle .",
    "_ parameters are the same as in figure 4 .",
    "_    _ initial data are inside the limit cycle ( figure 7 ) . _    .",
    "trajectory tends to the _ ]    _ limit cycle , which is an attractor . _",
    "_ initial data are inside the limit cycle ( figure 7 ) . _",
    "in many works on mathematical biology and economics @xcite the modelling of population dynamics or economical processes is based on lotka - volterra equations . as a rule , continuous , not discrete ,",
    "models are studied . in some works",
    "the migration process is considered .",
    "it takes place between different regions , inside which an interaction of the lotka - volterra type is present .",
    "for example , in @xcite the migration rate between regions has some fixed probability .    we study discrete lotka - volterra models with an additional interaction between them .",
    "that may be interpreted as a some kind of correlation between the habitants of different regions .",
    "we suppose that discrete models are more natural , partially it is clear that birth and death of individuals happen at some fixed moments of time .    it is well known that in the classical discrete pray - predator model a stable point exist .",
    "the amount of prays and predators tends to this point in the phase - space . in this case",
    "we observe the following dynamics , after several period of oscillations the populations stabilize ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "thus , we have an attracting point in phase - space .",
    "such a dynamics exists inside every region when `` migration '' is absent .",
    "when we introduce an additional interaction between the habitants of different regions a redistribution process appears which we interpret as a migration .",
    "in some of our complex models there is no stable point , the amount of prays and predators in both regions oscillates along fixed orbits.appearently these orbits in a phase - space are attractors .",
    "we note that explicit formulas of conflict interaction between non - annihilating opponents which describe the redistribution of populations are given by ( 3.1 ) .",
    "the individuals of a certain kind migrate to the region , where their amount more numerous .",
    "is the `` migration strategy '' which is described in our model a natural one ? we suppose that in many cases individuals may be right behaving in such a way .",
    "if we consider a pray - predator model , it is clear that every separated individual is unable to estimate all factors that have an influence on the population dynamics like vital resources inside region , real amount of own and alternative population , current population dynamics . in other words ,",
    "the individual `` does not know '' the parameters of the lotka - volterra equations and their current influence on the population dynamics .",
    "however the individual has the group reflex and will migrate to the region , where , as he supposes , the vital conditions are best ( his population should be concentrated there ) .",
    "he suggests , right there are the resources , possibilities for reproduction , better conditions to organize large groups .",
    "formula ( 3.1 ) just describes this tendency .",
    "similar motivations may be proposed in case of the work migration . here",
    "the unemployed may be regarded as playing the role of `` prays '' , employees as playing the role of `` predators '' .",
    "people , who seek for work and migrate to another country , do not know , as a rule , the real situation in the opposite region .",
    "they prefer to migrate to the country where the majority of their friends migrated ( group reflex ) .",
    "so , at the cost of migration accelerates the increasing of one of species population in one of the regions .",
    "but at the same time there is an effect of the inner pray - predator `` fight '' inside every system .",
    "partially , the population influences itself at the cost of the last term in lotka - volterra equation.as a result , some time later the backward migration starts .    in the figure 6",
    "we may see the effect of delay , when the amount of prays inside the region decreases , but the predators continue migration to this region , until their amount starts decreasing by following the lotka - volterra model .",
    "we emphasize , that in our model , in comparison with discrete lotka - volterra model , a cyclic oscillations of populations are observed .",
    "moreover , a cyclic attractor exists in the phase - space , and the pray - predator trajectory tends to this orbit both from inside or outside point with respect to this cycle ( figure 8,9 ) .",
    "we remark that in our model the normalization was fulfilled by the amount of habitants of the region , so the component of the corresponding vector may be large both at the cost of large population of fixed individuals and at the cost of small whole population of the region .",
    "so , a migration to the region with a lot of `` free space '' is also possible",
    ".    we also studied model with the attracting interaction ( @xmath218 ) . in this case",
    "we obtained formally a similar dynamics , but now individuals migrate to the region where they are less numerous . such a migration strategy might be also natural for some species , e.g. for individuals who hunt separately , control large territory and have confrontation with relatives ."
