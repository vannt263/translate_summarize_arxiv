    "fine control of p53 activity is crucial for proper cellular responses .    in unstressed cells",
    ", p53 is maintained at low levels via interactions with e3 ubiquitin ligases , such as mdm2 @xcite , pirh2 @xcite , cop1 @xcite and arg - bp1 @xcite , which mediate p53 degradation through the ubiquitin - proteasome pathway . under stressed conditions such as dna damage",
    ", p53 is stabilized and activated to induce the expression of downstream target genes .",
    "this process leads to different cellular responses such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis ; the former facilitates dna repair and promotes cell survival , whereas the latter provides an efficient way to remove damaged cells @xcite .",
    "these processes are tightly controlled by the binding partners and post - translational modifications @xcite .",
    "for example , upon the occurrence of dna double - strand breaks ( dsbs ) , the dsb detector atm is activated and induces the phosphorylation of p53 and mdm2 @xcite .",
    "phosphorylation of p53 and mdm2 inhibits mdm2-mediated p53 degradation and therefore stabilizes p53 .",
    "p53 can be phosphorylated or acetylated at multiple sites by different protein kinases , and its stability and sequence - specific dna binding activity are modulated through these processes @xcite .",

    "pdcd5 is rapidly upregulated following apoptotic stimuli and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during early apoptosis @xcite .",
    "decreased expression of pdcd5 has been detected in various human tumors , including lung cancer @xcite , gastric cancer @xcite , chronic myelogenous leukemia @xcite , prostate cancer @xcite , epithelial ovarian carcinoma @xcite , astrocytic glioma @xcite and chondrosarcoma @xcite .",
    "moreover , the restoration of pdcd5 with recombinant protein or an adenovirus expression vector can significantly sensitize different cancers to chemotherapies @xcite .",
    "thus , pdcd5 likely plays a critical role in multiple tissues during tumorigenesis .",
    "however , the molecular mechanisms that underlie the function of pdcd5 during cell growth , proliferation and apoptosis remain largely unclear .",
    "previous experiments have demonstrated that pdcd5 is apparently upregulated in cells following apoptotic stimulation @xcite , enhances caspase-3 activity by modulating bax translation from the cytosol to the mitochondrial membrane @xcite , interacts with tip60 to enhance histone acetylation and p53 acetylation at lys120 , and promotes the expression of bax @xcite .",
    "recently , novel evidence indicated that pdcd5 is a p53 regulator during gene expression and the cell cycle @xcite .",
    "it was shown that pdcd5 interacts with the p53 pathway by inhibiting the mdm2-mediated ubiquitination and nuclear exportation of p53 and that knockdown of pdcd5 can decrease the ubiquitination level of mdm2 and attenuate the expression and transcription of p21 .",
    "hence , upon dna damage , pdcd5 can function as a co - activator of p53 to regulate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis .",
    "many computational models have been constructed to investigate the mechanism of the p53-mediated cell - fate decision @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the p53/mdm2 oscillation is highlighted as important to the cell - fate decision following dna damage .",

    "these models advance the understanding of the dynamics and functions of the p53 pathway in the dna damage response . in @xcite",
    ", it has been suggested that the decision between the cell fates of survival and death might be determined by counting the number of p53 pulses . in @xcite ,",
    "the two feedback loops of atm - p53-wip1 and p53-pten - akt - mdm2 are combined in the p53 signaling network .",
    "a two - phase p53 response has been shown in this model ; pulses occur during dna repair and are sustained at a high level that triggers apoptosis if the damage can not be fixed after a crucial number of p53 pulses .",
    "furthermore , dynamical analysis has shown that the atm - p53-wip1 loop is essential for the generation of the p53 pulses and that the pten level determines whether p53 acts as a pulse generator or a switch . despite extensive studies of the p53 pathway , little work has been focused on modeling the pdcd5 interactions . the first model of pdcd5-regulated dna damage decisions was established by @xcite .",
    "two known pathways were considered in this model : the interaction of pdcd5 with tip60 in the nucleus , and the regulation of bax translocation in the cytoplasm .",
    "this model revealed that the cytoplasmic pathway plays an important role in pdcd5-regulated cell apoptosis @xcite .",
    "however , how pdcd5 interactions with the p53 pathway affect cell fate decision has not been considered in previous models",
    ".    motived by the above considerations , we constructed a mathematical model of the p53 signaling network with pdcd5 interactions in the present study to examine the effects of pdcd5 on p53-mediated cell fate decisions in response to dna damage .",
    "the main results of this study suggest that pdcd5 can function as a co - activator of p53 to regulate p53-dependent cell fate decisions by mediating the dynamics of p53 .",
    "the effects of pdcd5 are dose dependent , and various cell fates can occur for cells with different pdcd5 levels .",
    "our model was based on p53 responses to dna damage caused by ionizing radiation ( ir ) @xcite and pdcd5 interactions with the p53 pathway @xcite ( figure [ fig : simplifiedmodel ] ) . in the model ,",
    "the cell fate decision following dna damage is mediated by p53 pulses through the p53-mdm2 oscillator , and pdcd5 interacts with p53 and functions as a positive regulator in the p53 pathway .    an integrated model with four modules for the p53 signaling network has been developed by @xcite .",
    "this model includes the following processes : dna repair , atm switch , p53-mdm2 oscillation , and cell fate decision .",
    "when a cell is exposed to ir , a certain number of dsbs are generated in the cell and induce the formation of dsb repair - protein complexes ( dsbcs ) , and the repair process ensues .",
    "subsequently , dsbcs promote the conversion of inactive atm monomers to active forms @xcite such that active atm ( ) becomes dominant after exposure to ir .",
    "after the activation of atm , the p53 level exhibits a series of pulses due to the feedback loops in the p53-mdm2 oscillator . the protein p53 and its negative regulator mdm2 are the core proteins in this oscillator ( figure [ fig : simplifiedmodel]a ) . in the nucleus , p53 is activated by in two ways .",
    "first , promotes the phosphorylation of p53 on ser-15 @xcite and accelerates the degradation of mdm2 through phosphorylation @xcite .",
    "thus , induces a conversion of p53 from the inactive state to the active state ( 53 ) @xcite .",
    "second , 53 is deactivated at a basal rate . here , only 53 can induce the production of @xmath1 , which in turn promotes the translation of _ p53 _ mrna in the cytoplasm @xcite .",
    "in undamaged cells , p53 levels are kept low by mdm2 through the negative - feedback between 53 and @xmath2 .",
    "after damage , the p53-mdm2 complex is dissociated due to activation of p53 by , and the levels of 53 and @xmath1 increase abruptly through the positive feedback between 53 and @xmath1 .",
    "in the cell fate decision module , p53 coordinates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis to govern cell fate through the phosphorylation of p53 at distinct sites ( figure [ fig : simplifiedmodel]b ) .",
    "the primary phosphorylation of p53 on ser-15 leads to cell cycle arrest , whereas the further phosphorylation of p53 on ser-46 promotes expression of pro - apoptotic genes such as _ p53aip1 _ @xcite .",
    "the above two forms of phosphorylated p53 are termed p53 arrester and p53 killer , respectively @xcite .",
    "there are three feedback loops involved in the conversion between p53 arrester and p53 killer .",
    "the p53 arrester - inducible gene _ wip1 _ can promote the reversion of p53 killer to p53 arrester @xcite , while the gene _ p53dinp1 _",
    ", which is induced by both p53 arrester and p53 killer , contributes to the formation of p53 killer @xcite .",

    "p53aip1 _ induces the release of cytochrome _ c _ from mitochondria , and apoptosis rapidly ensues after the activation of caspase-3 . a positive - feedback loop between cytochrome _",

    "is weakly expressed in unstressed conditions , and is upregulated in cells upon apoptotic simulation @xcite .",
    "following the onset of an apoptotic stimulus , the cytoplasmic pdcd5 protein level first increases rapidly and forms an inward gradient from the cytoplasm to the nucleus @xcite .",
    "this pattern is maintained for a few hours until the initiation of apoptosis , which is paralleled by a rapid translocation of pdcd5 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus @xcite .",
    "hence , after dna damage , nuclear pdcd5 is maintained at an intermediate level during the dna repair process .",
    "pdcd5 has been found to up - regulate p53 activity through at least two interactions @xcite .",
    "when u2os cells were transfected with either control or pdcd5-specific sirna , p53 protein levels decreased following the knockdown of pdcd5 .",
    "simultaneously , the knockdown of pdcd5 failed to influence the levels of p53 mrna levels , which suggests that pdcd5 enhances the stability of p53 and does not regulate p53 at the transcriptional level @xcite .",
    "co - localization analysis in u2os cells further revealed that pdcd5 co - localizes with p53 in the nucleus .",
    "furthermore , nmr experiments indicated that pdcd5 can bind with the n - terminal domain of p53 ( p53@xmath3 ) @xcite , which overlaps with the binding site between p53 ( p53@xmath4 ) and mdm2 @xcite .",
    "when p53 was incubated with whole lysates of hela cells that overexpressed mdm2 , p53 strongly bound to mdm2 , but this interaction between p53 and mdm2 decreased significantly in the presence of recombinant human pdcd5 .",
    "moreover , pdcd5 can be pulled down with p53 .",
    "these results suggest that pdcd5 might disrupt the p53-mdm2 interaction via the direct interaction between p53 and pdcd5 @xcite , which is consistent with the results of the nmr study @xcite .",
    "interestingly , pdcd5 has been found to be capable of dose - dependently decreasing the protein level of mdm2 .",

    "hence , pdcd5 dissociates the p53-mdm2 complex promotes mdm2 degradation .",
    "these interactions are shown with red lines in figure [ fig : simplifiedmodel]a .",
    "at the cell fate decision module , pdcd5 in the nucleus interacts with tip60 to promote the tip60-induced lys120 acetylation of p53 ( the killer form of p53 ) @xcite . in the cytoplasm",
    ", pdcd5 promotes the translocation of bax from the cytosol to the mitochondrial outer membrane to induce the release of cytochrome _ c _ @xcite .",
    "chip assays in u2os cells have shown that pdcd5 might associate with the _ p21 _ promoter to promote transcription activation after dna damage @xcite .",
    "knockdown of pdcd5 attenuates the expression and transcription of p21 @xcite .",
    "hence , pdcd5 in the nucleus increases the transition from p53 arrester to p53 killer and promotes the transcription of p21 , and pdcd5 in the cytoplasm up - regulates bax translocation to increase cytochrome _",

    "this simplification is acceptable in the current study because we intended to investigate the effects of pdcd5 on p53 dynamics after dna damage . for a more complete understanding of the effect of pdcd5 on cell fate decisions following dna damage , an integrated model that incorporates pdcd5 dynamics @xcite and the responses of the p53 pathway @xcite",
    "is certainly required and will be the subject of further studies .      in the formulations , we first simplified the models presented in @xcite to a six differentiation equations for the modules of the p53-mdm2 oscillator and cell fate decision , and a time - dependent level was introduced for the dna repair process .    in the p53-mdm2 oscillator , inactive p53 in the nucleus",
    "is degraded rapidly by mdm2 and was thus assumed to be at quasi - equilibrium in our model . hence , three components were included in the p53-mdm2 oscillator : active p53 in the nucleus @xmath5 , mdm2 in the nucleus @xmath6 , and mdm2 in the cytoplasm @xmath7 .",

    "biologically , the parameter value @xmath51 is adjustable if we can modify the binding affinity between pdcd5 and p53 via methods such as single molecule engineering . to further explore how various affinities ( @xmath51 ) affect the cell fate decision , we varied @xmath51 and @xmath16 to examine the p53 dynamics and caspase-3 activity ( figure [ fig : a1]a ) .",
    "the results revealed that caspase-3 was activated only when @xmath52 , and that the two parameter regions with either sustained p53 or pulsed p53 were separated by the curve @xmath53 .",
    "for small @xmath51 values ( @xmath54 ) , pulsed p53 always yielded caspase-3 activity ; however , when @xmath51 was large , pulsed p53 did not necessarily imply caspase-3 activity when @xmath16 was not sufficiently large ( see figure [ fig : samplepaths]b ) .    .",

    "to further investigate the cellular apoptosis probability , we applied the method of multicell simulation@xcite to simulate a group of @xmath55 cells each of which had parameters that were randomly chosen from a range of @xmath56 away from their default values .",
    "the cell fate of apoptosis was marked by caspase-3 activation , and the fraction of apoptotic cells provided the apoptosis probability .",
    "figure [ fig : a1]b shows the apoptosis probabilities with @xmath24 from @xmath29 to @xmath30 and strong and weak affinity @xmath45 values .",
    "the results suggested that when pdcd5 is low , the significant increase in the expression of @xmath45 can significantly enhance cell apoptosis .",
    "we note that when @xmath24 takes an intermediate value ( @xmath57 , arrow at figure [ fig : a1]b ) , increasing @xmath45 tends to decrease the probability of apoptosis .",
    "this counterintuitive result was due to the possibility that a cell can display pulsed p53 without activation of caspase-3 .",
    "these results provide possible directions for interfering with the binding affinity of pdcd5 and p53 to modulate cell fate decisions in clinical treatments .",
    "pdcd5 is known to interact with p53 and functions as a regulator in the p53 pathway during responses to dna damage . in the present study",
    ", we constructed a mathematical model of the p53 signaling network with the interactions of pdcd5 .",
    "the model was based on the integrated model of the p53 signaling network that was previously proposed @xcite , and the interactions of pdcd5 with the p53/mdm2 oscillator and cell fate decision were included in accordance with recent observations @xcite .",
    "the computational model consisted of two p53/mdm2 oscillator and cell fate decision modules .",
    "the dna repair process was represented by increases in active atm and pdcd5 concentrations , both of which were given by pre - defined time - dependent functions and were incorporated into the equation coefficients .",
    "the model simulations showed that pdcd5 can modulate the cell fate decision by mediating p53 dynamics in a dose - dependent manner such that p53 can display either sustained or pulsed dynamics in cells with different levels of pdcd5 .",
    "moreover , pdcd5 regulates caspase-3 activation via two mechanisms that operate in the two regions of sustained and pulsed p53 dynamics .",
    "we found that the cell fate decision is sensitive to the cytoplasm pathway of pdcd5 , which agrees with the results of our previous studies @xcite .",
    "moreover , the pdcd5-regulated disruption of mdm2-mediated p53 degradation is also important for the interaction of pdcd5 with the p53 pathway , which suggests that it is possible to modulate cell fate decision via interference in the binding affinity between pdcd5 and p53 .",
    "this study sought to investigate the effects of pdcd5 on p53 dynamics following dna damage .",
    "a more comprehensive analysis of p53-mdm2 dynamics has recently been provided by @xcite . for a more complete understanding of how pdcd5 functions to regulate dna repair and apoptosis following dna damage , the pdcd5 dynamics @xcite and the p53 pathway response need to be incorporated @xcite .",
