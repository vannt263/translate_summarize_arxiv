    "determining the transport coefficients of many - particle systems is one of the fundamental problems of nonequilibrium statistical physics .",
    "this is also a notoriously difficult problem : it turns out that even in a simplified system where a single particle moves in a periodic array of scatterers , the drift and diffusion coefficients are highly irregular , apparently nowhere differentiable functions of control parameters @xcite ( an example is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] below ) .",
    "closer inspection of these functions reveals that usually their `` irregularities '' are not random , but rather form patterns .",
    "this has led some researchers to the idea that the graphs of these functions are fractals with nontrivial , perhaps locally varying fractal dimension .",
    "this is an interesting concept , since fractal structures are quite commonly found in dynamical systems in various contexts @xcite .    until very recently no reliable investigation of fractal properties of transport coefficients was possible because all general methods of calculating transport coefficients in dynamical systems ",
    "e.g.  the transition matrix technique combined with the escape rate formalism @xcite , the green - kubo formula @xcite , or the periodic - orbit formalism @xcite  eventually lead to complicated and time - consuming numerical calculations .",
    "moreover , usually they are applicable only for some special values of the control parameters . for these reasons none of them",
    "could be used to collect a sufficiently large number ( counted at least in millions ) of very precise data required in fractal analysis .",
    "this situation changed when groeneveld and klages @xcite gave exact formulas for the transport coefficients in a simple one - dimensional dynamical system introduced by grossmann and fujisaka @xcite .",
    "the system investigated by groeneveld and klages can be considered as a model of a particle moving in a one - dimensional array of scatterers .",
    "the role of the equation of motion is played by a one - dimensional map @xmath0 @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a discrete - time variable and the map @xmath3 is given by a simple linear function @xmath4 on the fundamental interval @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the control parameters representing the slope and the bias of the map , respectively ; the map is then continued periodically onto the real line by a lift of degree one , i.e. by requiring that @xmath7 for @xmath8 the lyapunov exponent of this system is positive , and so the dynamics defined by @xmath9 is chaotic .",
    "if we choose an arbitrary number @xmath10 as the starting point , the resulting sequence @xmath11 will almost always look `` random '' ( the set of points @xmath10 generating a regular , periodic or quasi - periodic sequence @xmath11 is of lebesgue measure 0 ) . for suitably chosen values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 the deterministic dynamics defined by the map @xmath9 is equivalent to a markov stochastic process of random - walk type : each deterministic trajectory @xmath11 is equivalent to some particular realization of the corresponding random - walk process , and",
    "taking the average over all initial states is equivalent to calculating averages over the corresponding gibbs ensamble .",
    "actually any random - walk markov process in a one - dimensional periodic system with fixed transition rates can be translated into the language of simple piecewise linear deterministic maps @xcite . from this point of view",
    "there is no surprise that the process defined by @xmath9 ( or similar maps ) is called `` deterministic diffusion '' and that the two basic transport coefficients , the drift velocity @xmath14 and diffusion constant @xmath15 , can be defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the average over the uniform ensamble of initial values @xmath10 .",
    "the graph of the diffusion coefficient @xmath15 for the map @xmath9 as a function of the slope @xmath12 for the bias @xmath18 is shown in fig .",
    "the fractal properties of this highly irregular graph ( as well as that of the drift velocity @xmath14 ) were recently studied by klages and klau@xcite . using two numerical methods : the box counting and the autocorrelation function methods",
    ", they found that the local fractal dimensions of graphs of @xmath14 and @xmath15 are well - defined , but highly irregular functions of @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "in other words they found that the graph shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] can not be described with a single fractal dimension , but rather by a set of quickly varying local fractal dimensions . taking this into account they suggested that the local fractal dimensions of graphs of @xmath14 and @xmath15 as functions of the slope @xmath12 with the bias @xmath13 fixed are fractal themselves .",
    "this , in turn , leads to the concept of a `` fractal fractal dimension of deterministic transport coefficients '' @xcite .",

    "the autocorrelation function method gave @xmath23 , and the box - counting method gave even lower values @xmath24 .",
    "all these values are very close to 1 , i.e.   the fractal dimension of a regular , `` smooth '' curve .",
    "this suggests that perhaps @xmath25 and that the results obtained in the above - mentioned computer simulations reflected extremely slow convergence of @xmath20 to its true asymptotic limit of infinitesimally small `` boxes '' .",
    "such slow convergence is often caused by logarithmic corrections .",
    "the main purpose of my paper is thus to try and find such tiny corrections . to accomplish this task",
    "i will use a different method of calculating the local fractal dimension of a curve  the so called oscillation method @xcite  and i will carry out all calculations with a help of a special high - accuracy numerical library , which will enable me to consider exceptionally small `` boxes '' . for sake of simplicity",
    "i shall restrict the present study to the simplest case of zero bias ( @xmath18 ) where , due to symmetry , the drift velocity @xmath26 .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sectionmethod ] briefly describes the method i have used to determine the local fractal dimension .",
    "it describes all steps necessary to calculate the diffusion coefficient for the map @xmath9 , a method of calculating the local fractal dimension of a continuous curve ( `` the oscillation method '' ) , mathematical formulation of the main conjecture about the logarithmic convergence of the fractal dimension to its limiting value , and the numerical aspects of the algorithms used .",
    "section [ sectionresults ] presents the main results .",
    "finally , section [ sectionconclusions ] is devoted to discussion of results .",
    "the explicit formulas @xcite for the transport coefficients in the model depend on some auxiliary variables . for each @xmath27 , and @xmath28 we define two infinite sequences , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 , @xmath32 , consisting of real and integer numbers , respectively .",

    "this implies that the fractal dimension of the graph of @xmath15 as a function of the control parameter @xmath12 is equal 1 , but the convergence to this limiting value is logarithmically slow , with the exponent @xmath60 controlling the convergence rate .",
    "i checked conjecture ( [ conjecture ] ) using equations ( [ 2reccursion ] )  ( [ jd ] ) . because the consecutive terms of the sequences @xmath61 in ( [ nr ] ) can be generated extremely efficiently ( it took less than a second to generate 20  000 data points used to draw figure  [ fig1 ] ) , i decided to employ gmp ( gnu multiple precision arithmetic library , version 4.1.2 )",
    " a library for arbitrary precision arithmetic @xcite .",
    "although any calculations performed by such a library must be several orders of magnitude slower that those performed directly , thanks to the gmp i was able to study numerically the limit of @xmath62 for @xmath46 ranging from @xmath63 down to at least @xmath64 ( the accuracy of typical computers currently available , without using such special - purpose libraries , is limited typically to about @xmath65 ) .",
    "such fine resolution of my calculations will turn out crucial for determining logarithmic corrections predicted by formula ( [ conjecture ] ) .",
    "in my present study i decided to concentrate on verifying conjecture ( [ conjecture ] ) for the symmetrical case of vanishing bias ( @xmath66 ) and for several selected values of the slope @xmath12 .",
    "i decided to examine especially carefully the slopes corresponding to finite markov partitions .",
    "these values are particularly interesting from the theoretical point of view @xcite ; for example , even though the diffusion coefficient @xmath15 is always continuous in @xmath12 @xcite , the numerator and denominator in ( [ nkl : eps ] ) can be discontinuous for such ( and only such ) slopes .",
    "one of the reasons why i chose to set @xmath18 is that in this case the slopes corresponding to markov partitions can be found easily on a computer : they are algebraic numbers generating periodic sequences @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "such values of @xmath12 will be henceforth referred to as `` markov slopes '' .",
