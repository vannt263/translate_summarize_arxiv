    "present universe is in the phase of accelerated expansion@xcite .",
    "there are many observational evidences , which indicate the presence of hitherto unknown dark energy such as supernovae ia , large - scale structure , cosmic microwave background anisotropies , etc . @xcite . by all reckoning ,",
    "the explanation of present accelerated expansion of the universe is a major challenge in cosmology .",
    "there are many approaches to explain its dynamics .",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "however , there are two main problems associated with cosmological constant ",
    "( i ) the fine tuning problem and ( ii ) the coincidence problem . besides cosmological constant , there exist two basic approaches to explain dark energy .",
    "the first approach is based on modified matter models . in this approach @xmath3 in the einstein equations",
    "includes an exotic matter component like quintessence , k - essence , phantom etc . @xcite .",
    "the second approach is through modified gravity models wherin the late - time accelerated cosmic expansion is realized without using the explicit dark energy matter component in the universe . in these models",
    ", we have a spectrum of @xmath0 gravity @xcite , scalar - tensor theories , gauss - bonnet dark energy model etc . @xcite .",
    "further , in @xmath0 models , one modifies the laws of gravity by replacing lagrangian density i.e. scalar curvature @xmath2 of the hilbert s action by an arbitrary function of @xmath2 . at present",
    ", there is no specific functional form of @xmath2 which may satisfy all the conditions of cosmological viability . to achieve this we use the stability conditions of respective eras and determine the corresponding forms of @xmath0 . by solving the field equations for different forms of @xmath0 for the corresponding eras , the scale factor of expansion",
    "is determined .",
    "from here we find the scalar curvature @xmath2 and compare them in different eras .",
    "this can lead to the determination of a time - ordering of various epochs , dominated by radiation , matter and dark energy , respectively , throughout the evolution of the universe .    in section",
    "ii , the fixed points of the dynamical system have been determined within the framework of @xmath0 models in metric formalism . in sections iii and iv properties and stability of the fixed points of the dynamical system is are explained without and with radiation .",

    "vi and vii we derive the form of @xmath0 , scale factor @xmath4 and scalar curvature @xmath2 for matter dominated and the present accelerated expansion dominated phases , respectively .",
