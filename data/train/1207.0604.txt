    "the interest in minimal energy problems in the presence of an external field , which goes back to the pioneering works by gauss  @xcite and frostman  @xcite , was initially motivated by their direct relations with the dirichlet and balayage problems . a new impulse to this part of potential theory ( which is often referred to as the gauss variational problem ) appeared in the 1980 s when gonchar and rakhmanov  @xcite , mhaskar and saff  @xcite efficiently applied logarithmic potentials with external fields in the investigation of orthogonal polynomials and rational approximations to analytic functions .",
