    "the neutrinos were proposed by w. pauli in 1930  @xcite and first detected by c.  cowan and f.  reines in 1956  @xcite .",
    "later the solar neutrino deficit  @xcite , the atmospheric neutrino oscillations  @xcite , and other neutrino oscillation results  @xcite have revealed that the neutrino masses are nonzero .",
    "however the questions about the absolute scale of their masses , their type ( whether dirac or majorana ) , etc .",
    ", still remain unanswered .    besides the reactor  @xcite , gallium  @xcite and few other neutrino anomalies , the available neutrino data can be explained within the phenomenological model of three light neutrinos with two mass splittings ( squared mass differences ) of close scales : @xmath3  ev@xmath4 and @xmath5  ev@xmath4  @xcite .",
    "we call it the conventional neutrino theory ( cnt ) . in case of majorana ( dirac ) neutrinos the masses and mixings",
    "are generically parametrized in cnt by 9 ( 7 ) free parameters : 3 masses , 3 mixing angles and 3 phases ( 1 phase ) .    in this paper",
    "we show that the variety of the neutrino data can be explained in a model with three majorana neutrinos with simple @xmath0 symmetric ( in the leading order )  democratic \" mass matrix .",
    "this democratic neutrino theory ( dnt ) , which was briefly presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , predicts the normal hierarchy of the neutrino mass spectrum , and allows to determine from the atmospheric neutrino data the absolute scale of the neutrino masses of @xmath1  ev .    in the case of slightly perturbed democratic mass matrix",
    ", dnt has huge predictive power , and only one its parameter @xmath2 is enough to determine to a good precision the available oscillation data .",
    "however there is a single large mass splitting . if it governs the atmospheric neutrino oscillations than the second mass splitting is much less than @xmath6  ev@xmath4 .",
    "for this reason we give up the interpretation of the data obtained by the kamland experiment  @xcite in terms of the neutrino oscillations due to their mass splitting of order @xmath6  ev@xmath4 , and provide a nonstandard explanation of the solar neutrino data .",
    "also in the discussed case the neutrino mass matrix is essentially different from the tri - bimaximal one  @xcite , which motivates us to use alternative explanation of several atmospheric and accelerator neutrino observables .    on the other hand , for relatively large deviation from @xmath0 symmetric mass matrix a standard interpretation of the neutrino data may come into play , while the predictive power is reduced .    in the next section dnt",
    "is introduced , and the neutrino masses and mixing are derived .",
    "further we discuss the neutrino oscillations in section  [ neutrino oscillations ] and alternative explanations of the neutrino experimental data in the framework of dnt in section  [ neutrino experiments ] . then we compare dnt with cnt in section  [ discussion ] , discuss the predictions of dnt in section  [ predictions ] , and conclude .",
    "a lowest order democratic quark mass matrix proportional to @xmath7 was discussed in the context of @xmath8 symmetry of massless quarks in the @xmath9 gauge model in ref .",
    "@xcite . possible relation of this matrix to the leptonic mixing was investigated in ref .",
    "the two @xmath10 invariant mass matrixes for majorana neutrinos @xmath11 were discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite with focus on the first of them .",
    "the second of the matrices in eq .   was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of brane models .",
    "in dnt we consider this matrix as the leading order neutrino mass matrix in usual low - energy @xmath12 theory .",
    "then we add either sizable ( of order few % ) or tiny ( orders of magnitude less than 1% ) perturbations .",
    "these two cases require different explanation of the neutrino data , see the following .",
    "consider the mass term for three majorana neutrinos@xmath13 where @xmath14 are the flavor indices , @xmath15 denotes charge conjugation , and @xmath16 is the neutrino mass matrix in the flavor basis , where @xmath17 is a _ democratic _ mass matrix , which is invariant under the permutation group of three elements @xmath0  @xcite , and is defined by the only mass scale parameter @xmath2 .",
    "possible perturbations to this leading order mass matrix are included in the little - o term @xmath18 in eq .  , and they are discussed below .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath19 form the neutrino mixing matrix , which can be written as @xmath20 and makes the transformation from flavor to mass basis as @xmath21 where the subindex @xmath22 refers to the leading order approximation .",
    "the last column of @xmath23 corresponds to the larger eigenvalue of @xmath19 , and the first row does not include zero to explain the solar neutrino data , see section  [ solar neutrinos ] .",
    "it is convenient to parametrize eq .   using only two angles as @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and tilde denotes our parametrization .",
    "notice that in eq .",
    "we used the opposite order of multiplication of the euler rotation matrixes @xmath29 with respect to the ordinary tri - bimaximal matrix  @xcite .    in the case of standard parametrization of the neutrino mixing matrix @xcite , eq .",
    "is reproduced by @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and no @xmath34 violating phases .    by diagonalizing the mass matrix @xmath19 with the matrix @xmath23 and expressing @xmath35 through the majorana spinors @xmath36 as @xmath37 eq .   can be rewritten as @xmath38 where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 are the sign factors , which can be absorbed by the transformation @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "on relation of the sign factors to the neutrino @xmath34 properties and mixing matrix see section 2.3.2 in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein . the resulting neutrino mass spectrum @xmath43 has normal ordering and two degenerate values , which results in the only mass splitting @xmath44      similarly to the great variety of broken symmetries in nature , it is naturally that the degeneracy in eq .",
    "is violated by a small perturbations in eq .  .",
    "suppose that these perturbations are _ tiny_. this leads to a spectrum @xmath45 where @xmath46 measures the violation of  full democracy \" ( in section  [ solar neutrinos ] we consider @xmath47 for effective suppression of the respective oscillations in the sun ) , and we ignore possible deviation in the eigenvalue @xmath48 since this does not significantly effect the large neutrino mass splitting @xmath49 . as a result , for the two splittings we have : @xmath50 and @xmath51 . to consider the neutrino oscillations with reasonable accuracy the neutrino mixing matrix can be written as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a constant of order one , and the deviations in nonzero elements",
    "are neglected since all these elements are large .    in section  [ neutrino experiments ]",
    "we show how atmospheric , solar and accelerator neutrino observables can be explained using only parameter @xmath2 , neglecting small effects of other parameters .",
    "consider the case of _ sizable _ perturbations in the mass matrix @xmath54 , which lead to the spectrum @xmath55 where the deviations @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) can be written as @xmath58 with the small , but essentially larger than @xmath59 in eq .  , mass scale @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , and the dimensionless parameters @xmath62 of order unity ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "then the mass splitting @xmath64 can be rewritten as @xmath65 and we end up with the spectrum @xmath66 where @xmath67",
    ". the two splittings @xmath68 and @xmath69 may correspond to the ordinary solar and atmospheric neutrino mass splittings , respectively .",
    "( that is why we used this notation for them in eqs .   and ) .",
    "the neutrino mixing matrix has sizable corrections in relation to eq .  .",
    "in particular , the @xmath70 element may be significantly smaller , and there may be essential @xmath34 violation . thereby , ordinary interpretation of the neutrino experimental data may be applied .",
    "however in the following sections we will concentrate on more interesting and predictive case of tiny perturbations , which requires an alternative explanation of the neutrino data .    in both cases of either tiny or sizable perturbations the neutrino mass spectrum has normal ordering , and the absolute neutrino mass scale is about @xmath71 . using the atmospheric neutrino mass splitting @xmath72  ev@xmath4 ( at 99.73% cl )  @xcite ,",
    "the absolute neutrino mass scale can be determined as @xmath73",
    "the probabilities of the flavor neutrino oscillations in vacuum can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the oscillation length , and @xmath76 is the constant phase . using the leading order democratic neutrino mass spectrum in eq .   and mixing in eq .",
    "we have the  democratic \" oscillation probabilities of the same size @xmath77 where @xmath78 .    in case of the spectrum of eq .   the probabilities @xmath79 are slightly different from eq .   due to the oscillation terms with @xmath80 , while the results in eq .",
    "are reproduced in the limit @xmath81 .",
    "in particular , for the electron neutrino survival probability we have @xmath82",
    "in this section we discuss the explanation within dnt ( in its case with tiny perturbations ) of the data obtained by the neutrino experiments of several types .",
    "the atmospheric neutrino flux dominates by the neutrinos with the energies in the range @xmath83 gev @xcite .",
    "correspondingly , for the oscillations due to @xmath84 with @xmath2 from eq .",
    "the oscillation length is in the range @xmath85  km , which is relevant for the terrestrial experiments .",
    "however the oscillations due to @xmath86  ev@xmath4 can not be observed since their oscillation length @xmath87  km significantly exceeds the earth diameter .",
    "for this reason , in dnt with tiny perturbations the atmospheric neutrino oscillation probabilities are well described by eq .  .",
    "consider how this equation may explain the significant zenith - angle deficit of @xmath88 observed by the super - kamoikande ( sk ) detector  @xcite .",
    "we remark that in cnt this deficit was interpreted as the 2-flavor @xmath89 oscillations , taking into account the suppression of @xmath90 oscillations by a small @xmath91 .    in dnt",
    "this difference between the @xmath92-like and @xmath93-like event distributions in the sk can be explained by the 3-flavor oscillations in eq .  , taking into account the matter effect on @xmath94 , which travel through the earth .",
    "indeed , for the electron neutrinos propagating in the matter with the electron number density @xmath95 the probability to oscillate into other flavor state can be written as  @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 @xmath98^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) resonance density is given by @xmath99}{e [ \\text{mev } ] } \\cos2\\theta \\quad    \\text{cm}^{-3 } \\ , \\text{n}_\\text{a }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath100 and @xmath101 being fermi constant and avogadro number , respectively .",
    "in particular , for the atmospheric neutrinos with energies @xmath102  gev we have @xmath103 , and using the mean electron number density in the earth core @xmath104  @xcite , we find @xmath105 which is significantly suppressed with respect to the vacuum oscillations in eq .  .",
    "notice that the @xmath106 oscillations in the matter of the earth proceed practically as in vacuum due to approximate equality of the refraction indices  @xcite .",
    "the close to unity amplitude of the muon neutrino oscillations @xmath108 observed in the minos experiment  @xcite is explained in dnt with tiny perturbations by the large oscillations of the muon neutrinos to both electron and tau neutrino flavors , and analogous for the antineutrinos .",
    "the matter effect plays a subdominant role for the beam neutrinos in the minos experiment in contrast to the nearly upward atmospheric neutrino events due to the shorter baseline @xmath109  km and relatively small matter density in the earth crust @xmath110 . neglecting the matter effect we have the probability @xmath111 whose amplitude agrees with the minos result @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) at 90% cl for the muon ( anti)neutrino oscillations , derived within 2-flavor approximation  @xcite .",
    "reanalysis of the minos data taking into account the matter effect in the framework of 3-flavor democratic oscillations would even improve this agreement  @xcite .",
    "we remark that in cnt @xmath114 oscillations dominate in the muon neutrino disappearance in minos , and @xmath108 is considered as an amplitude @xmath115 of these @xmath114 oscillations with close to maximal ( @xmath116 ) values of @xmath117 and @xmath118 .       vs. the neutrino energy .",

    "the observed flux of the solar neutrinos @xmath120 reveals a deficit with respect to the predictions of the standard solar model , which is known as the solar neutrino problem  @xcite . in other words , the survival probability @xmath121 for solar neutrinos",
    "is suppressed with respect to unity , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : solar_nu ] by the data points obtained by the homestake  @xcite , the sno  @xcite , the borexino  @xcite , and other solar neutrino experiments  @xcite",

    "is suppressed due to the averaging over the region of @xmath94 production in the sun , similarly to cnt  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the oscillations due to @xmath80 are strongly suppressed by the effect of solar matter if @xmath123 .",
    "hence from eq .",

    "[ fig : solar_nu ] .",
    "this line comes to an agreement with the data in case of slightly less conservative error bars for the low energy data points .",
    "in fact , it is reasonable to reexamine these error bars since the low energy @xmath120 data still suffer from the gallium anomaly  @xcite , the discrepancy between the homestake and the borexino results , effects of solar model calculations , etc .",
    "one example of such reexamination was done in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the homestake data were combined with the borexino @xmath126b data ( the result is also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : solar_nu ] ) .    we should stress that @xmath121 in eq .",
    "is independent of the @xmath120 energy .",
    "this provides an efficient tool for verification of the solar model calculations , since the neutrino fluxes are quite sensitive to their parameter variations , in particular , in the solar models with late accretion  @xcite .    the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : solar_nu ] represents the result of cnt , where the transition from higher to lower values of @xmath121 with the energy increase is due to the msw resonant neutrino oscillations in the sun .",
    "this line can be also approximately reproduced in the dnt with sizable perturbations . with the energy increase , having either a mixing matrix constructed of the eigenvectors of @xmath19 in eq .   or a slightly perturbed one , restricts possible form of the leading order mixing matrix .",
    "one of the possibilities is @xmath23 in eq .   with zero @xmath127 entry .",

    "there is a large number of ( anti)neutrino flux calculations and monte carlo event generators in the market , and large number of discrepancies among them  @xcite .",
    "these generators were developed using the experimental data , but in the framework of cnt . from the point of view of dnt , this is an additional source of the systematic errors .",
    "for this reason , so far we have discussed the neutrino experimental results , which are less dependent on the absolute normalization of the data samples .",
    ".comparison of democratic and conventional models [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ tab:1 ]    the differences in the explanation of the discussed neutrino data in the framework of cnt and dnt are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "its left column lists the following experimental results : ( 1 ) suppression of @xmath129 oscillations observed by the sk , ( 2 ) large amplitude of muon neutrino oscillations observed by the minos and the sk , and ( 3 ) deficit of solar neutrinos .",
    "ways of explanation of these results within cnt ( which can be applied also in the dmt with sizable perturbations ) are listed in the second column .",
    "the third column shows the alternative ways to explain these results within the dnt with tiny perturbations .",
    "note that in this case only the parameter @xmath2 significantly effects the discussed observables .",
    "this makes it possible to perform a simplified global analysis of the neutrino data .",
    "however the experiments , which measure @xmath91 should be properly taken into the consideration .",
    "several experiments  @xcite have interpreted their data as measuring of @xmath130 .",
    "however these results depend significantly on the discussed above normalization of the neutrino fluxes , the assumption of @xmath131 , etc .",
    "for example , in the reactor experiments  @xcite @xmath132 disappearance ratio is @xmath133}{e_{\\bar\\nu_e}[mev ] } \\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) is the observed ( expected , assuming no oscillations ) number of the antineutrinos . as a result , in case of close to unity value of @xmath136 ( small @xmath91 ) , which is supposed in cnt , a 10% error in the total neutrino flux leads to a huge error in @xmath91 exceeding 100% . on the other hand , in case of smaller @xmath136 the flux calculations derived within cnt ( including the correlations among reactor cores , etc . ) can not be applied in dnt .",
    "we argue that the measurements of @xmath91 should be reconsidered from the stage of development of the event generators in the framework of dnt , in order to seriously verify this theory .",
    "in dnt with tiny perturbations the neutrino masses and mixings are determined with good precision using the atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "this allows to make interesting predictions discussed below .      using eqs .   and",
    ", the average mass , determined through the analysis of low energy beta decays , can be written as @xmath137 for @xmath1  ev from eq .",
    "we have @xmath138  ev , which is far below the present upper limit @xmath139  ev ( at 95% cl ) obtained in the  troitsk @xmath140-mass \" experiment  @xcite , and below the sensitivity @xmath141  ev ( at 90% cl ) of ongoing katrin experiment  @xcite .",
    "however the new approaches , such as planned mare , echo , and project8 experiments , may probe the neutrino mass in the sub - ev region  @xcite .",
    "using eqs .   and , the effective majorana mass in the neutrinoless double beta decay can be written as @xmath142 where the terms of order @xmath2 cancel each other due to the sign factors in eq .  .",
    "hence this decay can not be observed in the near future searches , which makes them a useful tool for studying either precision nuclear physics or some new physics  @xcite",
    ".    note that in eqs .",
    "and we took into account possible deviations of order @xmath143 in the elements of the first row of the matrix @xmath144 in eq .  .",
    "the majorana neutrinos do not have diagonal magnetic moments , while their transition magnetic moments in case of opposite @xmath34 phases ( @xmath34 parities ) are nonzero  @xcite : @xmath145 where @xmath146 evt@xmath147 is the bohr magneton , and @xmath148 are the charged lepton masses .",
    "using eqs .  , and , we have @xmath149 .",
    "the effects of perturbations can not increase this tiny scale of the neutrino magnetic moment , which is 13 orders of magnitude below the present terrestrial bound @xmath150 ( 90% cl )  @xcite .",
    "this leaves a good opportunity for the new physics searches  @xcite .",
    "a neutrino theory , which is based on the simple democratic neutrino mass matrix , is introduced .",
    "this theory predicts normal hierarchical neutrino mass spectrum with the absolute neutrino mass scale of @xmath151  ev . in the case of tiny perturbations to the democratic mass matrix this theory explains to a good accuracy the atmospheric , solar and accelerator neutrino data , using only the parameter @xmath2 , and has a significant predictive power .",
    "interestingly , in this case we use an alternative explanation of several important neutrino results .",
    "nevertheless , in the case of sizable perturbations the conventional explanation may be applied .",

    "<S> new theory of neutrino masses and mixing is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> this theory is based on a simple @xmath0 symmetric democratic neutrino mass matrix , and predicts the neutrino mass spectrum of normal ordering . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the matter effect and proper averaging of the oscillations , this theory agrees with the variety of atmospheric , solar and accelerator neutrino data . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the absolute scale of the neutrino masses @xmath1  ev is determined in this theory , using the atmospheric neutrino oscillation data . in case of tiny perturbations in the democratic mass matrix only one this scale parameter @xmath2 allows to explain the mentioned above neutrino results , and the theory has huge predictive power . </S>"
