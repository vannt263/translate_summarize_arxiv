    "precise measurements of semileptonic kaon decay rates provide the measurement of the @xmath0  element of the ckm mixing matrix and information about lepton universality .",
    "helicity - suppressed leptonic kaon decays provide an independent measurement of @xmath15 , through the ratio @xmath10 .",
    "these measurements , together with the result of @xmath16 from nuclear @xmath17 transitions , provide the most precise test of the unitarity of the ckm mixing matrix through the relation @xmath18 .",
    "unitarity can also be interpreted as a test of the universality of lepton and quark weak couplings , testing the relation @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the fermi coupling constant from the muon decay .",
    "bounds on new physics extensions of the standard model can be set using the ratio of the @xmath0  values obtained from helicity - suppressed @xmath21 decays and helicity - allowed @xmath22 decays .",
    "the kaon semileptonic decay rate is given by : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is a clebsch - gordan coefficient , equal to @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath3   and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the decay width @xmath30 is experimentally determined by measuring the kaon lifetime and the semileptonic brs totally inclusive of radiation .",
    "the theoretical inputs are : the universal short - distance electroweak correction @xmath31 , the @xmath32-breaking @xmath33 and the long - distance electromagnetic corrections @xmath34 , which depend on the kaon charge and on the lepton flavor , and the form factor @xmath35 parametrizing the hadronic matrix element of the @xmath36 transition , evaluated at zero momentum transfer and for neutral kaons .",
    "the form factor dependence on the momentum transfer can be described by one or more slope parameters @xmath37 , measured from the decay spectra , and enters in the phase space integral @xmath38 .",
    "the kloe experiment at the frascati  can measure all the relevant inputs to extract @xmath0  from @xmath39  decay rates of both charged and neutral kaons : @xmath40s , lifetimes and form factors . in section  [ sec : obs ] an overview of the measurements for @xmath1 , @xmath2  and @xmath3   will be presented , followed by the extraction of @xmath0  in section  [ sec : vusf ] and bounds on new physics beyond the standard model in section  [ sec : np ] .",
    "the absolute brs for the four main @xmath1  decay channels have been measured from a sample of @xmath41 @xmath42 events tagged by @xmath43 decays .",
    "the results depend on the @xmath1  lifetime @xmath44 through the geometrical acceptance of the apparatus . using as reference value @xmath45  ns we get @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "an independent measurement , @xmath50  ns  @xcite , is obtained from the fit of the proper decay time distribution for @xmath51 events .",
    "tagged decays have been used for the measurement of the form factors for both @xmath7  and @xmath8  decays . for @xmath7",
    "decays the fit of the @xmath52 distribution , with @xmath53 the squared momentum transfer , is sensitive to both linear and quadratic terms of the power expansion of the form factor and agreement has been found between the results obtained with quadratic and pole parametrization . with the quadratic parametrization",
    "we get : @xmath54 and @xmath55  @xcite . using @xmath8  decays , the @xmath56 slope of the scalar form factor is obtained fitting the distribution of the neutrino energy @xmath57,due to the difficult @xmath58 identification at low energies , while @xmath59 and @xmath60 are measured from the combined fit with @xmath7  decays .",
    "the results are : @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63  @xcite .",
    "the fit to data distributions is only sensititive to the linear term of the power expansion of the scalar form factor , due to the -99.6% correlation between the coefficients of the linear @xmath64   and quadratic terms @xmath65 .",
    "however the linear parametrization over - estimates the value of @xmath64by about 20% .",
    "the solution is to use the dispersive representation in which vector and scalar form factors are described by two parameters only@xcite:@xmath66 and @xmath56 .",
    "the results are @xmath67 and @xmath68  @xcite and have been used in the evaluation of @xmath0 . from a preliminary update based on a larger @xmath8  data sample , averaged with the published values ,",
    "we get : @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "a  provides the unique opportunity of having a pure @xmath2@xmath71beam .",
    "therefore , using a sample of @xmath72 @xmath73 events in which the @xmath1  is identified by its interaction in the calorimeter , we have measured @xmath74  @xcite and @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "these two ratios completely determine the value of @xmath2  main brs and allow us to measure @xmath76 to be used in the @xmath0  extraction .",
    "the value of @xmath2  lifetime used in the present determination of @xmath77 is @xmath78  ns , from pdg fit to @xmath79 parameters  @xcite .",
    "the values of br(@xmath80 ) and br(@xmath81 ) have been determined separately for @xmath82 and @xmath83 decays tagged by @xmath84  and @xmath85   so to have four independent measurements for each br , minimizing the systematic contribution from the tagging procedure .",
    "the background rejection uses kinematics and the signal count is extracted from a constrained likelihood fit to the distribution of the squared lepton mass evaluated by time - of - flight measurements . using @xmath86  ns  @xcite to account for acceptance dependence on kaon lifetime ( @xmath87 ) , we obtain @xmath88 , and @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "the world average accuracy on @xmath3  lifetime @xmath90   is 0.2@xmath91  @xcite however the measurements  spread signals a poor consistency between the results .",
    "the kloe experiment has measured @xmath90  with @xmath92 tagged kaons and fitting the distribution of the kaon proper decay time @xmath93 evaluated with two independent methods : the kaon decay length and the kaon decay time from the time of flight of the photons from the @xmath94 in the final state .",
    "the first method gives @xmath95  ns , the second @xmath96  ns and the average is @xmath97  ns@xcite , in perfect agreement with pdg value . the absolute branching ratio of the  decay has been measured using @xmath9820 million tagged @xmath84 mesons .",
    "signal counts are obtained from the fit of the distribution of the momentum of the charged decay particle in the kaon rest frame .",
    "the result , inclusive of final - state radiation , is @xmath40()=0.2065(9 )  @xcite , 1.3% ( @xmath982@xmath14 ) lower than the pdg fit  @xcite .",
