    "in general , the two parties have to perform operations on _ both _ qubits to generate the orthogonal states @xmath1 .",

    "this means that by performing just _ local _ operations the two - qubit states are changed globally in such a way that the four outcomes are perfectly distinguishable ( i.e. , the four bell states are mutually orthogonal ) .",
    "in fact , we can say that the four outcomes are mutually equally ( and maximally ) distant , which can be expressed by their mutual overlap @xmath12 _ kl=|_k|_l|^2=_kl . [ 1.4 ] this remarkable property of bell states is due to the quantum entanglement between the two qubits @xcite .",
    "as suggested by bennett and wiesner @xcite , this property can be utilized for the _ quantum dense coding_. the idea is as follows : alice can perform locally on her qubit four operations that result in four orthogonal two - qubit states .",
