    "spontaneous supersymmetry breaking in a vacuum that is at least metastable is notoriously difficult to achieve in n=2 supersymmetric theories .",
    "this is related to the very constrained structure of these theories , with a non - linear sigma - model involving target spaces with special geometries and potentials related to the gauging of some isometries on these manifolds . in the interesting case of theories that can be consistently coupled to gravity ,",
    "several general results concerning the scalar masses in supersymmetry breaking vacua have been obtained , both for rigid and local supersymmetry . for theories with @xmath8 hypermultiplets and no vector multiplets ,",
    "it was proven in @xcite that at least one of the scalars must have square mass @xmath9 .",
    "similarly , for theories with @xmath10 abelian vector multiplets and no hypermultiplets , it was shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that the lightest scalar must have square mass @xmath11 .",
    "these bounds apply to theories with local supersymmetry , with @xmath2 parametrizing the vacuum energy and @xmath1 denoting the gravitino mass , and imply that de sitter vacua are necessarily unstable in those theories .",
    "they also have a non - trivial meaning in the rigid limit , in which they reduce to the statement that at least one scalar has @xmath12 , implying that non - supersymmetric vacua can not be completely stable @xcite .",
    "these universal results were derived by looking at the averaged sgoldstino mass , for which the dependence on the curvature of the scalar manifold turns out to drop out completely , contrary to what happens for n=1 theories @xcite ( see also @xcite ) or even n=2 to n=1 truncated theories @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to investigate whether there exists a similar bound on the mass of the lightest scalar in more general n=2 theories involving @xmath8 hypermultiplets and @xmath10 vector multiplets .",
    "little is known so far about the systematics of supersymmetry breaking in these theories for general @xmath8 and @xmath10 . however , the simplest case where @xmath13 and @xmath14 and a single isometry is gauged has been studied in full generality in @xcite for rigid theories and then in @xcite for local theories .",
    "exploiting the fact that in such a situation it becomes possible to parametrize the scalar geometries of both sectors in a much more concrete way in terms of harmonic functions , it was shown that a sharp bound on the mass of the lightest scalar emerges in this case too . for theories with local supersymmetry",
    ", this now approximately reads @xmath15 for @xmath16 and is given by similar simple expressions in various ranges of @xmath4 , and shows that de sitter vacua can be metastable for sufficiently large cosmological constant .",
    "for theories with rigid supersymmetry , the corresponding bound is best expressed as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the vector mass , and allows non - supersymmetric vacua to be metastable .",
    "these universal results were derived by reducing the full five - dimensional scalar mass matrix to a two - dimensional one by suitably averaging over the three physical scalars in the hyper sector and the two scalars in the vector sector .",
    "it is then clear that this approach does not quite correspond to just looking at the averaged sgoldstino mass , but rather exploits to some extent the distinction between the hyper and vector sectors .",
    "it is then natural to wonder whether a similar bound also persists in theories with generic @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "we will prove that this is indeed the case if there is only one gauged isometry .",
    "however , we will then argue that as soon as there are two or more gauged isometries , no universal bound is left , or in other words @xmath19 . in all our analysis",
    "we shall focus for simplicity on theories with abelian gaugings .",
    "but , it is clear a posteriori that this does not represent a true limitation in the reach of our conclusion , since non - abelian gaugings necessarily involve at least two gauged isometries , with which it is already possible to avoid a bound with an abelian gauging .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the general structure of n=2 gauged supergravity theories , focusing on abelian gaugings .",
    "in section 3 and 4 we then review how the known universal bounds on the square mass of the lightest scalar arises in theories with only hyper multiplets and only vector multiplets , emphasizing the crucial features that allow us to get rid of any dependence on the curvature of the scalar manifold . in section 5",
    "we derive a new universal bound for theories with both hyper and vector multiplets and a single gauged isometry . in section 6",
    "we then study the case of theories with both hyper and vector multiplets and a more general gauging , and argue that as soon as two or more isometries are gauged there is no way to derive any universal bound that does not depend on the curvature of the scalar manifold , and that by adjusting such a curvature at the vacuum point under consideration one can in fact achieve arbitrarily large masses for all the scalars .",
    "finally , in section 7 we summarize our main conclusions and their implications .",
    "let us consider a general n=2 gauged supergravity theory with @xmath8 hypermultiplets and @xmath10 vector multiplets , restricting for simplicity to abelian symmetries and using planck units .",

    "let us focus on the terms in the mass matrix that may a priori depend on @xmath60 or @xmath70 , and check whether they still disappear in the same way as before .    in the hyper - hyper block of the averaged scalar mass matrix , one finds that the term involving @xmath184 gives the following contribution : m^2_u v n^ux n^vx - 4 c^2 r_u r v s j^x^u_p",

    "the @xmath70 dependence can again only be eliminated through the stationarity condition when @xmath14 and @xmath196 , or whenever all of the @xmath151 triplets of killing prepotentials @xmath197 are accidentally parallel .",
    "we conclude that whenever @xmath198 and @xmath199 , and no accidental simplification occurs , there is no way of getting rid of both of the @xmath60 and @xmath70 tensors controlling the curvature of the scalar manifold by averaging over the sgoldstino directions in the two sectors .",
    "this implies that no simple universal bound on scalar masses can be derived and strongly suggests that the smallest eigenvalue of the scalar mass matrix can be freely adjusted by tuning the values of the curvature at the stationary point under consideration . to see that this is indeed the case",
    ", we can consider tuning the values of @xmath60 and @xmath70 , compatibly with the constraints imposed by the stationarity conditions , and then check that all the mass eigenvalues can indeed be made arbitrarily large relative to the gravitino mass . in this respect , we first notice that the values of the independent components of @xmath60 are left completely unconstrained by the stationarity conditions in the hyper sector , while the values of the independent components of @xmath70 are only partly constrained by the stationarity conditions in the vector sector unless additional peculiarities arise . as a result , by taking the values of @xmath60 and the unfixed values of @xmath70 to be large , one may achieve values of @xmath200 for all the entries of @xmath88 and values of @xmath201 for all the entries of @xmath202 , while the entries of @xmath203 will only be of @xmath204 .",
    "after diagonalization , one then finds @xmath205 square mass eigenvalues of @xmath206 and @xmath10 square mass eigenvalues of @xmath207 , since the level repulsion effect induced by the off - diagonal block gives only negligible corrections ( of @xmath208 on the former and of @xmath209 on the latter ) , and all of them are then large with respect to @xmath74 .",
    "we have performed various checks to verify that there is no general obstruction against achieving the situation described above , where arbitrary values for the scalar masses can be found by adjusting the curvatures of the quaternionic - khler and special - khler manifolds .",
    "it would be very interesting to construct an explicit family of examples where this can be realized concretely .",
    "for instance , one could consider the model with one hyper and two gauged isometries which can be described in general by the calderbank - pedersen space @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , even for this simple case it turns out to be algebraically complex to proceed along the same lines as @xcite .",
    "finally , we can also consider the special case with one graviphoton and one vector gauging two isometries ( i.e. @xmath170 and @xmath14 ) . in this case",
    "it is possible to remove the @xmath70 tensor but not the @xmath60 tensor from the scalar mass matrices .",
    "this implies that the entries of @xmath202 are fixed , whereas one can still achieve values of @xmath200 for the entries of @xmath88 .",
    "one can then see that @xmath60 can be tuned to make @xmath205 eigenvalues large , while the smallest of the remaining @xmath10 eigenvalues is bounded by @xmath130 .",
    "however , it remains unclear whether or not the value of @xmath210 can be made arbitrarily large by adjusting parameters , _",
    "i.e. _ whether or not a bound emerges in this case .",
    "in this work , we have studied the question of whether a universal bound exists on the scalar masses in a supersymmetry breaking vacuum of a generic @xmath211 supergravity theory involving both hyper and vector multiplets .",
    "we have shown that such a universal bound indeed exists for any theory where at most one isometry is gauged , and depends only on the gravitino mass @xmath1 and the cosmological constant @xmath2 at the vacuum .",
    "this result generalizes various previous analyses that were carried out for simpler restricted classes of situations involving a minimal type and/or a minimal number of multiplets @xcite , and implies that in these theories metastable de sitter vacua can exist for @xmath212 , but not for @xmath213 .",
    "we then argued that such a universal bound does not exist for theories where two or more isometries are gauged , and that in those theories any desired values for the lightest scalar square mass can , in principle , be obtained by suitably adjusting the curvature of the scalar manifold at the vacuum point through the parameters of the model .",
    "this implies that in such more general theories metastable de sitter vacua can exist not only for @xmath212 , but also for @xmath213 .",
    "we believe that the result presented in this paper represents a useful guideline towards the search for metastable de sitter vacua or slow - roll inflationary trajectories in supergravity theories emerging from string models , which often have at least some of the characteristics of theories with extended supersymmetry , even if they display only minimal supersymmetry .",
