    "at any redshift the majority of the neutral hydrogen in the universe is contained in the absorbers of highest column density , the damped ly@xmath0 ( dla ) absorbers .",
    "observations of the column density distribution functions @xmath3 for both hi and metals can be used to compute the cosmic mean densities @xmath4 and @xmath5 as functions of redshift @xmath6 .",
    "the metallicities of the dla systems have a large scatter at all redshifts ( pettini et al .",
    "1999 ; prochaska & wolfe 1999 ) ; the mean metallicity is 5 - 10% solar at @xmath7 and , within the current statistical uncertainties , may or may not increase with decreasing redshift , in accordance with models of cosmic chemical evolution ( kulkarni & fall 2002 ) .",
    "selection biases caused by dust could dilute the apparent rate of chemical enrichment in the dla absorbers ( pei & fall 1995 ; boiss et al .",
    "the dust - to - metals ratio also has a large scatter among individual dla absorbers , but the mean value appears to remain roughly constant with redshift at about the value in the milky way ( pei , fall , & bechtold 1991 ; pettini et al .",
    "the presence of metals implies that dla absorbers are , or have been , in a state of active star formation and it is therefore interesting to ask whether those stellar populations are themselves visible , and if they are related to other known classes of high redshift objects . in this paper we shall narrowly focus on a single question : `` are high - redshift damped ly@xmath0 galaxies lyman - break galaxies ? '' .    the lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs , steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) are starburst galaxies at high redshift , recognisable by their relatively flat restframe ultraviolet continuum , and a sharp discontinuity at the lyman limit . under the definition of lbgs",
    "we include all objects identified by their characteristic continuum shape as such , on the basis of broadband photometry alone i.e. without requiring spectroscopic confirmation . the typical brightness of an lbg is not a well defined quantity as it depends strongly on the flux limit of the survey . in particular one may consider two distinct types of lbg survey , where surveys concerned solely with the determination of photometric redshifts have significantly fainter flux limits than those which classify as lbgs only galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts .",
    "it is of interest to note that to an ab magnitude limit @xmath8 , i.e. flux limited in the restframe optical continuum , nearly all galaxies in the hubble deep field n in the redshift range @xmath9 are classified as lbgs ( papovich , dickinson , & ferguson 2001 ) . with the caveat that this sample is small",
    ", it may be concluded that for observations in the optical and near - infrared , to very faint magnitudes , any galaxies with steep continuum , either due to reddening or to the presence of a population of old stars , are a minority population .",
    "so at these wavelengths , and down to the ab magnitude limit @xmath8 , the term ` lyman - break galaxy ' is essentially synonymous with ` high - redshift galaxy ' .",
    "the global rate of star formation at these redshifts measured from emission from the lbgs is consistent with the rate of star formation inferred from the change with cosmic time of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the dla absorbers ( pei , fall , & hauser 1999 ) , modulo uncertain corrections in both calculations for the effects of dust .",
    "the simplest interpretation of these results is that the dla absorbers are the reservoirs of gas from which the stars in lbgs are forming .",
    "if this is the case , for every high - redshift dla absorber detected in the spectrum of a quasar there should be stellar emission visible from a lyman - break galaxy at the absorption redshift , coincident with or near to the line of sight to the quasar .",
    "yet searches for this stellar emission have had very little success ( for reviews and discussions of past surveys see mller & warren 1993 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "the large number of unsuccessful attempts to identify the galaxy counterparts of dla absorbers , hereafter `` dla galaxies '' , indicates that most dla galaxies at @xmath10 have very small impact parameters or are very faint ( e.g. steidel , pettini , & hamilton 1995a ) .",
    "indeed searches that have produced lists of candidates pending spectroscopic confirmation ( e.g. ellison et al .",
    "2001a ) , as well as the very limited set of confirmed identifications available at present ( fynbo , mller , & warren 1999 ) , both suggest that dla galaxies mostly are fainter than @xmath2 lbgs , a result supported by upper limits on h@xmath0 emission ( bunker et al .",
    "1999 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "this is seen by some to contradict the view that dla galaxies are lyman - break galaxies .",
    "in particular the theoretical prediction that the angular momentum distribution of dark matter halos should cause lbgs and dla galaxies to form two `` quite distinct populations '' ( mo , mao , & white 1999 ) has received much attention , and it has been suggested that dla galaxies make up a separate low surface brightness galaxy population ( jimenez , bowen , & matteucci 1999 ) .    at redshifts",
    "@xmath11 the dla galaxies are much easier to identify , but it is far from clear how they are related to high - redshift dla galaxies .",
    "nevertheless it has been found that also the low redshift dla galaxies typically are sub @xmath2 ( steidel et al .",

    "make a comparison of their emission properties with the emission properties of lbgs .",
    "the images presented here are the first combined ( both stis and nicmos ) results from a large campaign of hst observations searching for 18 dla galaxies towards 16 quasars .",
    "the targets , the strategy , and the goals are presented in detail in our first paper ( warren et al .",
    "2001 ) which also presented the results of the nicmos imaging campaign .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy is being carried out with the isaac and fors instruments on the eso vlt . in ",
    "2 we present a discussion of how to use such a search for dla galaxies to test the hypothesis that dla galaxies are lbgs . in ",
    "3 we describe briefly the hst observations , and the measurements of the images . in ",
    "4 we make a comparison of the measured properties , including sizes , colours , and morphologies , with the properties of lbgs _ of similar absolute magnitude_. in  5 we address the question posed at the top , and present our conclusions .",
    "cosmological parameters of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 are assumed , and the term high redshift implies in this paper @xmath9 .",
    "because of the glare from the quasar the detectability of a dla galaxy is dependent both on the brightness of the galaxy and the impact parameter ( in addition to the brightness of the quasar and the stability of the point spread function ( psf ) ) . any sample of dla galaxies , including the small sample of three discussed here , is biased towards brighter objects and larger impact parameters .",
    "_ yet if dla galaxies are lbgs , the measured emission properties of any dla galaxy must fall within the range of emission properties for lbgs of the same absolute magnitude .",
    "_ this statement is true regardless of how the dla galaxies were selected .",
    "this is the basic prediction that we test in this paper .",
    "we compare the measured half - light radii , and colours of dla galaxies , as well as the morphologies , and ly@xmath0 emission properties , against the same properties measured for lbgs of similar absolute magnitude .    if dla galaxies are lbgs they will nevertheless have a different luminosity distribution compared to a flux limited sample of lbgs , because dla absorbers are detected in proportion to their gas cross section .",
    "it follows that the luminosity distribution of dla galaxies is given by the lbg luminosity function weighted by the luminosity dependence of the gas cross section .",
    "a simple calculation illustrates the importance of this for the interpretation of searches for dla galaxies . for a luminosity function of schechter form , and a power - law relation between gas radius and luminosity @xmath15 , the mean luminosity of galaxies selected by gas cross section is @xmath16 ( fynbo , mller , & warren 1999 ; see also wolfe et al .",
    "1986 ; impey & bothun 1989 ) . for lbgs at @xmath17 , adelberger & steidel ( 2000 ) measure @xmath18 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath19 , the value of the mean luminosity can be much less than @xmath2 .",
    "for example for @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "in fact there is some theoretical support for a value of @xmath22 ( haehnelt , steinmetz , & rauch 2000 ) , based on the kinematics of dla absorbers as measured from the absorption profiles of low ionisation species .",
    "so the notion that dla galaxies are typically fainter than @xmath2 is perfectly compatible with the hypothesis that dla galaxies are lyman - break galaxies .",
    "we note that a consequence of this is that the value of any property which depends on galaxy luminosity will differ between galaxy samples selected either by absorption ( dla galaxies ) or by emission ( lbg galaxies ) .",
    "for example , since spatial clustering is weaker for less massive ( hence less luminous ) galaxies ( the effects of natural biasing in a hierarchical clustering scenario ) , we expect dla galaxies to have a lower clustering amplitude than the emission - selected lbgs .    in the longer term , when we have completed our hst survey",
    ", we will have a sample of dla galaxies complete within well defined selection criteria .",
    "using the measured impact parameters we will be able to determine the form of the relation between radius and luminosity . in fact we have already attempted this ( fynbo et al . 1999 ) . one point to note",
    "is that the conclusion that dla galaxies are much fainter than @xmath2 is quite robust , and insensitive to the uncertainty of the faint - end slope @xmath0 of the lyman - break galaxy luminosity function . for a different value of @xmath0",
    ", the value of @xmath19 must be adjusted in order to reproduce the observed small impact parameters of dla galaxies .",
    "the result is that the value of @xmath23 changes little , because the exponent @xmath24 appearing in the expression for @xmath23 remains approximately constant .",
    "in this section we detail the measurement of the emission properties of the three dla galaxies , which will be compared against the lbgs in the next section .",
    "the larger imaging campaign is described by warren et al .",
    "we are obtaining high - resolution optical and near - infrared images of quasars , searching for faint galaxies close to the quasar line of sight . these are candidate dla galaxies , targets for spectroscopic follow up . in warren",
    "et al . ( 2001 ) we list the 16 target quasars and their coordinates , we tabulate details of the 18 dla absorbers , present details of the nicmos observations , and the list of nicmos candidates . each quasar was observed for three orbits with the nic2 camera and the f160w filter .",
    "the nicmos images reach to an ab magnitude typically of @xmath25 .",
    "a total of 41 candidate counterparts were detected in boxes of side @xmath26 centered on each quasar .",
    "spectroscopy of this candidate list is @xmath27 complete .",
    "so far one new spectroscopically confirmed dla galaxy has been discovered .",
    "the other two dla galaxies discussed here are previous discoveries .    in mller et al .",
    "( in preparation ) we will present the candidates detected using stis .",
    "with stis we are imaging in the 50ccd configuration i.e. without a filter in order to reach as deep as possible . in this configuration",
    "the effective central wavelength is 5851.5  and the fwhm is 4410.3 so 50ccd corresponds to a very wide v magnitude .",
    "each quasar was observed for two orbits , at different orientations , resulting in a detection limit on the combined image of typically @xmath28 ( ab magnitude ) . because the stis images reach much fainter magnitudes than the nicmos images , the number of candidates in the stis images is typically a factor 2 - 3 higher than in the nicmos images .",
    "1 reproduces the stis images of the fields of the three quasars pks0528250 , q22061958 , and 2233.9 + 1318 , where the frames from both orbits have been registered and summed .",

    "the measured impact parameters are @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , respectively . in each case",
    "the confirmed galaxies are the candidates in the nicmos frames closest to the line of sight to the quasar .",
    "the three dla galaxies have all been confirmed by spectroscopic detection of ly@xmath0 in emission , but were originally found with three different search techniques .",
    "n-7 - 1c was identified on a deep ly@xmath0narrow band image obtained from the ground , n-14 - 1c was found on the image from our current stis campaign ( fig .",

    "we have tested this prediction , making the comparison for the following emission properties : half - light radius , radial profile ( sersic @xmath1 parameter ) , optical - to - near - infrared colour , morphology , ly@xmath0 emission ew , and ly@xmath0 emission velocity structure . in all cases",
    "the measured values for the dla galaxies lie within the range measured for lbgs .",
    "none of the measurements is in conflict with the prediction . _",
    "therefore we conclude that the measured emission properties of the three damped ly@xmath0 galaxies studied here are consistent with the conjecture that damped ly@xmath0 galaxies are lyman - break galaxies .",
    "_    is the number of detections in the follow - up spectroscopy so far completed of the 41 nicmos candidates also consistent with this conjecture ? since two of the dla galaxies discussed here were previously known they are ignored in this statistical analysis .",
    "we have obtained deep vlt fors spectra , average integration time 6000s , of 11 of the 22 nicmos candidates in 6 fields , targeting 8 dla absorbers .",
    "we have identified and confirmed one new dla galaxy , and we would expect to have confirmed @xmath94 new dla galaxies . here",
    "the factor @xmath95 is the fraction of dla galaxies detectable in the nicmos images i.e. above the magnitude and impact - parameter detection limits of our survey ( approximately @xmath96 , @xmath97 ",
    "full details provided in warren et al . , 2001 ) and",
    "@xmath98 is the fraction of dla galaxies with detectable ly@xmath0 flux ( our @xmath99 detection limit ranges from 0.2 to @xmath100 erg s@xmath93 @xmath101 depending on redshift , column density and impact - parameter of the dla ) . if dla galaxies are lbgs then both of the factors @xmath95 and @xmath98 are likely to be substantially less than unity (  2 and  4 ) .",
    "therefore the detection of only one new dla galaxy so far is consistent with the hypothesis , but the number of detections is clearly too small to rule out other interpretations .",
    "the combination of information on both the stellar ( emission ) and interstellar ( absorption ) components of the dla galaxies is crucial for a complete understanding of these objects .",
    "the result presented here is a step towards combining the information from absorption - line and emission studies of high - redshift galaxies . to prove that dla galaxies are lbgs",
    ", the test we have made is a necessary but not sufficient condition .",
    "we are building a larger sample of dla galaxies with well - defined selection properties , from spectroscopy of candidates found in deep hst images .",
    "a definitive test will be possible with this sample .",
    "knowing the selection biases we can determine the relation between gas radius and luminosity that explains the number of dla galaxies detected , their luminosities , and their impact parameters .",
