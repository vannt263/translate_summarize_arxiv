    "optical properties of multiple quantum well ( mqw ) structures have been attracting a great deal of attention during the past decade .",
    "@xcite the main motivation for this interest is the potential in these systems for effective control of the light - matter interaction .",
    "quantum wells in mqw structures are separated from each other by relatively thick barriers , which prevent a direct interaction between excitons localized in different wells .",
    "they however , can be coupled by a radiative optical field , and their optical properties , therefore , become very sensitive to the arrangement of the structures .",
    "most of the initial research in this area was focused on properties of periodic mqw s , which consist of identical quantum wells separated by identical barriers .",
    "the radiative coupling in this case gives rise to mqw polaritons ",
    "coherently coupled oscillations of the exciton polarization and light . in structures with a small number of wells , the spectrum of these collective excitations consists of a discrete number of quasi - stationary ( radiative ) modes with a re - distributed oscillator strength : the modes can be classified as super- or sub - radiant.@xcite with an increase of the number of wells in the structure , the radiative life - time of the latter decreases , and the life - time of the former increases .",
    "when the number of periods in the structure becomes large enough , the modes of the mqw are more conveniently described in terms of stationary polaritons of infinite periodic structures.@xcite the spectrum of polaritons in this case consists of two branches separated by a polariton gap , which is normally proportional to the light - exciton coupling constant , @xmath0",
    ". there exists , however , a special arrangement of mqw s where the magnitude of the gap can be significantly increased . if the period of the mqw structure is made equal to the half - wavelength of the exciton radiation , the geometric , bragg , resonance occurs at the same frequency as the exciton resonance . as a result",
    ", the band gap between two polariton branches becomes of the order of magnitude of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the frequency of the exciton transition .",
    "these , so called bragg mqw structures were quite intensively studied both theoretically @xcite and experimentally.@xcite in the case of structures with a small number of periods , the reconstruction of the optical spectra in bragg mqw s can be described as a concentration of the oscillator strengths of all oscillators in one super - radiant mode , while all other modes become dark.@xcite    a presence of the large band gap in the spectrum of bragg mqw polaritons invites attempts to introduce a defect into a structure in order to create local polariton states with frequencies in the band gap .",
    "this would affect the rate of spontaneous emission as well as other optical characteristics of the system .",
    "such an opportunity was first considered in ref .",
    ", and was studied in detail in refs .  .",
    "it was shown @xcite that by introducing different types of defects one can obtain optical spectra of a variety of shapes , which can be pre - engineered through the choice of the type of a defect , its position in the structure , the number of defects , etc .",
    "this fact makes these systems of interest for optoelectronic application .",
    "however , in order to be able to predict the optical spectra of realistic structures , any theoretical calculations must deal with the problem of inhomogeneous broadening , which is always present in these systems due to unavoidable structural disorder present in quantum wells .",
    "calculations of refs .   included inhomogeneous broadening using the linear dispersion theory.@xcite the linear dispersion theory treats inhomogeneous broadening as a simple addition to homogeneous broadening , ignoring therefore , effects of the motional narrowing , which have been very well studied in periodic multiple quantum wells.@xcite by doing so , the linear dispersion theory grossly overestimates the negative influence of inhomogeneous broadening , thereby giving unrealistically pessimistic predictions .",
    "the latter fact was verified in ref .  , where effects of the vertical disorder on the defect - induced features of the spectra were considered numerically .",
    "more accurately inhomogeneous broadening can be studied with the help of the effective medium approximation , which was originally introduced in ref .   on the basis of some qualitative arguments . in this approximation ,",
    "a random susceptibility of a single quantum well is replaced by its value averaged over an ensemble of exciton frequencies , and therefore , one only needs to take into account the horizontal disorder , since on average all wells in the structure are assumed identical .",
    "this approach was shown to agree well with experimental results for both cw and time - resolved spectra,@xcite but so far it has not been justified theoretically . in this paper , we derive this approximation from the maxwell equations with a non - local exciton susceptibility and demonstrate explicitly the physical meaning of this approximation and the regions of its applicability .    the main objective of this paper is to study the effects of the inhomogeneous broadening in bragg mqw structures with defects .",
    "here we consider only one structure , namely a gaalas / gaas structure with one of the wells replaced by a well with a different exciton frequency . a similar defect",
    "was considered in ref .  , where it was called an @xmath3-defect ; we retain this terminology in this paper . the consideration in ref .",
    "was focused mostly on the concept of local polariton states arising in infinite bragg mqw structures , and on the effect of the resonant light tunnelling arising due to these local states in long ideal bragg mqw s . in this paper , we consider defect - induced modification of the optical spectra in more realistic systems . we take into consideration the inhomogeneous broadening and",
    "concentrate on structures with the number of periods readily available with current growth technologies . keeping in mind the potential of these structures for applications",
    ", we study under which conditions the defect - induced resonant features of the spectra of realistic structures can be observed experimentally .",
    "we develop a general understanding of the spectral properties of bragg mqw s in the presence of defects and disorder required for identifying structures most interesting from the experimental and application points of view .",
    "we also obtain a simplified analytical description for the main features of the spectra , valid in some limiting cases . this description is complemented by a detailed numerical analysis .",
    "one of the surprising results is that the features associated with the resonant tunnelling via the local polariton state survive in the presence of disorder for much shorter lengths of the structure than was originally expected.@xcite this makes experimental observation and application of these effects significantly more attractive .",
    "we also suggest a method of determining experimentally parameters of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening of a defect well in our structures from a single cw reflection spectrum .",
    "such an opportunity seems to be quite exciting from the experimental point of view , since currently the separation of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings requires the use of complicated time - resolved spectroscopic techniques .",
    "attempts to develop a method for an independent extraction of the parameters of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings from spectra of periodic mqw structures were undertaken in refs .  , but they also required either a time resolved spectroscopy or a not very reliable fourier transformation of the original cw spectra .",
    "within the framework of the linear nonlocal response theory , propagation of an electromagnetic wave in a multiple quantum well structure is governed by the maxwell equations @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the background dielectric constant assumed to be the same along the structure , @xmath6 is the excitonic contribution to the polarization defined by @xmath7 and the susceptibility @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the exciton envelope function and @xmath11 is the growth direction . considering only the 1-s heavy hole exciton states and neglecting the in - plane dispersion of excitons , the susceptibility can be written as@xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the exciton resonance frequency , @xmath14 is the exciton relaxation rate due to inelastic processes , @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the exciton longitudinal - transverse splitting and @xmath17 is the bulk exciton bohr radius .",
    "the reflection spectrum of mqw structures is effectively described by the transfer matrix method . for waves incident in the growth direction of the structure ,",

    "( [ eq : susc_frequency ] ) , introduces the nonradiative homogeneous broadening due to inelastic dephasing of excitons .",
    "inhomogeneous broadening results from fluctuations of the exciton transition frequency @xmath13 in the plane of a well caused by , for example , imperfections of the interface between the well and the barrier layers and/or presence of impurities . in general ,",
    "fluctuations of the exciton frequency are described by the @xmath28-point distribution functions , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a coordinate of a point in the plane of the quantum well .",
    "however , in the effective medium approximation,@xcite adopted in this paper , only a simple one - point function , @xmath31 , is needed .",
    "this function is used to define an average susceptibility , neglecting a possible dependence of the exciton envelop function on the energy , @xcite @xmath32 in this approach , the inhomogeneous broadening is characterized by the variance of the distribution function , @xmath33 . as we already mentioned in the introduction , the effective medium approximation has never been actually derived , and therefore , its theoretical status and applicability remains unclear . in the appendix",
    "we demonstrate how this approximation can be obtained from a general theory of interaction between light and excitons in a disordered quantum well , and explain why it gives such an accurate description of the optical properties of quantum wells .",
    "the function @xmath8 replaces @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_and_t ] ) and determines a single - well transfer matrix of a broadened well,@xcite which is then used to construct the transfer matrix describing the propagation of light through the entire bragg mqw structure .",
    "the structure considered in this paper , a bragg mqw with an @xmath3-defect , consists of @xmath35 quantum well - barrier layers which are all identical except for one , at the center , where the quantum well has a different frequency of the exciton resonance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : structure ] ) .",
    "such a defect can be produced either by changing the concentration of @xmath36 in the barriers surrounding the central well,@xcite or the width of the well itself@xcite during growth . in principle",
    ", both these changes will also affect the optical width of the defect layers , either because of the change in the background dielectric constant , or due to the change of the geometrical thickness of the well .",
    "however , in both cases this effect is negligible , and we deal here with the case of a pure @xmath3-defect .",

    "the size of the polariton gap strongly depends on the relation between @xmath52 and @xmath55 , and reaches the maximum value when they coincide , i.e. when @xmath56 ( the bragg structure ) . for these frequencies , it is convenient to extract the imaginary part from @xmath51 and to present it in the form @xmath57 if the coupling parameter @xmath26 is small , @xmath58 in the gap can be approximated by the following expression , which is obtained by expanding eq .",

    "the frequency , which corresponds to this boundary determines the width of the gap as @xmath64 .",
    "this value is significantly greater than the respective width in the off - bragg case , which is proportional to @xmath65 . in the presence of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings , the notion of the band gap",

    "once the transfer matrix , @xmath68 , for the entire mqw structure is known the reflection and transmission coefficients can be expressed in terms of its elements , @xmath69 , as @xmath70 a defect inserted into the structure leads to a modification of the reflection spectrum of the mqw in the vicinity of the exciton frequency , @xmath71 , of the defect well .",
    "we are interested in the situation when @xmath71 lies within the polariton band gap of the ideal host structure , because in this case the defect produces the most prominent changes in the spectra .",
    "a typical form of such a modification in broadened systems is shown in fig .",

    "since the width of the polariton gap in bragg mqw structures is significantly greater than the typical value of the inhomogeneous width , we can choose such a position of the defect frequency , @xmath71 , which is far enough from @xmath52 , and at the same time remains within the gap frequency region .",
    "significant diminishing of the effects due to disorder in optical spectra of periodic mqw for frequencies away from the resonance exciton frequency was obtained theoretically in ref .   and observed experimentally in ref .  .",

( [ eq : r_add_details ] ) is suitable for a general discussion and numerical calculations , it is too cumbersome for a detailed analytical analysis . for such purposes we consider the reflection coefficient for two limiting cases when the expression for @xmath76 can be significantly simplified .",
    "the first limit corresponds to the situation when the penetration length of the electromagnetic wave at the frequency of the defect is much smaller than the length of the structure ( we call it a deep defect ) , and the second is realized in the opposite case , when the system is much shorter than the penetration length ( shallow defect ) .",

    "instead , we have a reflection spectrum with a minimum at @xmath137 and a maximum at @xmath138 .",

    ", we would like to emphasize again that the minimum of the reflection is the result of the radiative coupling between the wells even in this case of short systems .      in the previous subsections we examined special situations when",
    "the defect can be considered as either deep or shallow . in both cases",
    ", we were able to derive approximate analytical expressions describing defect - induced modification of the spectra and to obtain a qualitative understanding of how the defect affects the reflection spectrum .",
    "in particular , it was demonstrated that the characteristic frequencies related to the modification of the spectrum are shifted from the resonant defect frequency of a single well .",
    "this shift is the result of radiative coupling between the excitons in the defect well and the collective excitations of the host system .",
    "one of the important consequences of this shift is the possibility for almost complete suppression of the effects due to inhomogeneous broadening in some spectral intervals . in this subsection",
    "we consider systems with intermediate lengths , when @xmath74 is larger than @xmath156 , but is still smaller or of the order of magnitude of the penetration length . from the practical point of view , this case is of the greatest interest , since this interval of lengths is still easily accessible experimentally , and at the same time , it is expected that for such structures the defect - induced modifications of the spectrum become most prominent .",
    "unfortunately , neither approximation used in the previous subsections can be applied here , and we have to resort to a numerical treatment .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative understanding gained as a result of the previous analytical considerations , serves as a useful guide in analyzing and interpreting the numerical data .    as it was pointed out in the previous section , when @xmath74 becomes larger than @xmath156 , the position of the minimum of the reflection , @xmath137 moves closer to @xmath71 , and the inhomogeneous broadening starts contributing to @xmath151 .",
    "this effect can phenomenologically be described as the emergence of an effective broadening parameter @xmath157 , which is not a simple combination of @xmath14 and @xmath33 , but depends upon @xmath74 .",
    "this parameter is limited from below by @xmath14 , when the inhomogeneous broadening is suppressed , and from above by @xmath126 , when the contribution from @xmath33 is largest . because the minimum value of the reflection is always achieved at a point shifted with respect to @xmath71 , generally @xmath158 is always smaller than @xmath126 , and the homogeneous broadening makes the main contribution to it even for systems with @xmath159 _ despite the fact that @xmath160_. at the same time , the position of @xmath138 , which determines the width of the spectral interval affected by the defect , depends upon @xmath161 .",
    "thus the effect of the broadenings on the spectrum can in general be summarized in the following way : while the width of the resonance is determined equally by both homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings , its strength depends mostly upon the homogeneous broadening .",
    "we illustrate this conclusion quantitatively by defining the width of the resonance , @xmath162 , as a distance between the extrema of the reflection spectrum , and its depth , @xmath163 , as the difference between the values of the reflection at these points . in order to see how these quantities depend upon parameters @xmath14 and @xmath33",
    ", we chose several different values of @xmath112 and @xmath111 , and plot constant level lines , @xmath164 , @xmath165 .",
    "these lines represent values of @xmath14 and @xmath33 for which @xmath112 and @xmath111 remain constant ( fig .",
    "[ fig : constant_level ] ) .",
    "the locus of constant widths is the set of nearly straight lines running almost parallel to the axis representing the homogeneous broadening .",
    "slight deviation from the straight - line behavior is seen only for non - realistically high values of @xmath14 .",
    "such a behavior confirms our assertion that the width of the resonance is determined by an effective parameter , in which @xmath14 and @xmath33 enter additively .",
    "as we see , this is true even for systems which can not , strictly speaking , be described by approximations leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : shallow_maximum ] ) . since usually @xmath166 ,",
    "the latter makes the largest contribution to this effective parameter , and determines the value of @xmath112 .",
    "the shape of the lines of constant height demonstrates almost equal contributions from @xmath14 and @xmath33 , which means that the effect due to the inhomogeneous broadening is significantly reduced as far as this feature of the spectrum is concerned .",
    "this is also consistent with an approximate analysis presented in the previous section of the paper .",
    "the remarkable feature of fig .  [ fig : constant_level ] is that the lines of the constant width and the constant high cross each other at a rather acute angle and at a single value of @xmath14 and @xmath33 for each of the values of @xmath112 and @xmath111 .",
    "this means that one can extract both @xmath14 and @xmath33 from a single reflection spectrum of the mqw structure .",
    "this is a rather intriguing opportunity from the experimental point of view , since presently , the only way to independently measure parameters of homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings is to use complicated time - resolved techniques .",
    "+    it is clear , however , that the shape of the lines of constant @xmath112 and @xmath111 depends upon the choice of the distribution function used for calculation of the average susceptibility of the defect well .",
    "it is important , therefore , to check how the results depend upon the choice of the distribution function of the exciton frequencies . as an extreme example",
    ", one can consider the cauchy distribution @xmath167 in this case , all the effects due to the inhomogeneous broadening can be described by a simple renormalization , @xmath168 , and the level lines in fig .",
    "( [ fig : constant_level ] ) would have the form of parallel lines .",
    "this distribution though , hardly has any experimental significance , while the gaussian function has a certain theoretical justification.@xcite however , the symmetrical character of the normal distribution is in obvious contradiction with a natural asymmetry of the exciton binding energies , which can be arbitrarily small but are bounded from above . it was suggested in ref .   to take this asymmetry into account by introducing two different variances in the gaussian distribution : @xmath169 for frequencies below some ( most probable ) frequency @xmath170 , and @xmath171 for the frequencies above it .",
    "accordingly , the distribution function can be written as @xmath172 it was shown that this choice gives a satisfactory description of time - resolved spectra of mqws.@xcite the distribution function eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussian_assymetry ] ) can be parameterized either by @xmath173 and @xmath170 or , more traditionally , by the mean value , @xmath174 , the second moment , @xmath33 , and the parameter of asymmetry , @xmath28 , defined as @xmath175    we use the corrected distribution function , eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussian_assymetry ] ) , with the fixed mean frequency and the variance , but different values of the asymmetry parameter , in order to see how sensitive the defect induced features of the reflection spectrum are to the shape of the distribution function . to this end",
    ", we plot the lines of constant height and width for different values of the asymmetry parameter @xmath28 ( @xmath176 ) .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels_asymmetry ] .     +    an interesting result revealed by these graphs",
    "is that with the change of the asymmetry , the points at which @xmath112 and @xmath111 level lines cross move parallel to the axis of @xmath14 , while the respective values of @xmath33 remain quite stable .",
    "this indicates that the value of @xmath33 , which can be obtained by comparing experimental reflection spectra with the theory presented in this paper , is not sensitive to the choice of the distribution function of the exciton frequencies .",
    "the value of the parameter of the homogeneous broadening is more sensitive to the asymmetry of the distribution function : it varies by approximately ten percent when the parameter of the asymmetry changes by a factor of two .",
    "however , the estimate for @xmath14 can be improved by studying the temperature dependence of the reflection spectra .",
    "in the present paper we studied the reflection spectra of a bragg multiple quantum well system with a defect : the quantum well at the center of the structure was replaced by a well with a different exciton resonance frequency . in an ideal infinite system such a defect gives rise to a local state with a frequency within the polariton stop band of the host structure , which reveals itself in the form of reflection and transmission resonances.@xcite the main focus of this paper was on the effects due to the inhomogeneous broadening , which was taken into account within the framework of the effective medium approximation.@xcite since in ref .",
    "this approach was introduced on the basis of qualitative arguments only , in the appendix we presented a rigorous derivation of this approximation and clarified its physical status .",
    "we consider two limiting cases in which defect - induced features of the spectrum can be described analytically . in one case ,",
    "the length of the system is much larger than the penetration length of the radiation in the infinite periodic structure , @xmath177 ( deep defect ) .",
    "the modification of the reflection in this case is described by a lorentz - like minimum , whose depth exponentially decreases with increasing length of the mqw structure , eq .",
    "( [ eq : deep_far ] ) . for long enough structures",
    "the presence of the defect in the structure becomes unnoticeable .",
    "a much more interesting situation arises in the opposite case of systems much shorter than @xmath177 ( shallow defect ) . in this case",
    ", the reflection spectrum exhibits a sharp minimum followed by a maximum .",
    "this shape of the spectrum resembles a fano - like resonance observed in long lossless systems .",
    "the position of the maximum of the reflection is close to the exciton frequency in the defect well , @xmath71 , where the short host structure is almost transparent , and therefore the properties of the spectrum near this point are similar to those of an isolated quantum well . at the same time , the minimum is shifted from @xmath71 by @xmath178 and due to this shift an influence of the inhomogeneous broadening , @xmath33 , on the spectrum near this point is strongly suppressed . when @xmath143 the value of the reflection at the minimum , @xmath151 , is determined solely by the small homogeneous broadening , and this results in extremely small values of @xmath151 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : shallow_r_min_max ] ) .",
    "the structure of the spectrum with two extrema persists also in the case of an intermediate relation between @xmath177 and @xmath74 .",
    "this situation , however , is more complicated and can only be analyzed numerically .",
    "nevertheless , due to the shift of the minimum reflection frequency one can conclude that the minimum value of the reflection is determined mostly by the homogeneous broadening , while the distance between the maximum and the minimum is affected by an additive combination of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadenings .",
    "this circumstance allowed us to suggest a simple method of extracting both @xmath14 and @xmath33 of the defect well from the reflection spectrum of the structure .",
    "we are grateful to steven schwarz for reading and commenting on the manuscript .",
    "the work is supported by afosr grant f49620 - 02 - 1 - 0305 and psc - cuny grants .",
    "the objective of this appendix is to derive  from first principles \" the main result of the effective medium approximation , eq .",
    "( [ eq : app_r0_t0solutions ] ) with @xmath179 replaced by the average susceptibility , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : inhom_susc ] ) .    a wave incident at a normal , @xmath11 , direction on a quantum well can be described by a scalar form of maxwell s equations for one of the polarizations parallel to the plane of a quantum well : @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the polarization due to quantum well excitons .",
    "the latter is determined by an expression similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq : polarization ] ) with the exciton frequency being a random function of the in - plane coordinate @xmath182 @xmath183 where the susceptibility is @xmath184 in order to simplify our calculations we make an assumption that @xmath10 can be approximated by a delta - function .",
    "this approximation is sufficient for our particular goals here , but the results obtained will remain valid for more rigorous treatment of the excitonic wave functions as well . after the fourier transformation with respect to the in - plane coordinates , eq .",
    "( [ eq : app_maxwell ] ) can be presented in the form @xmath185 where @xmath186 .",
    "let us represent the susceptibility as a sum of its average value and a fluctuating part @xmath187 where @xmath188 can be written in the form @xmath189 the electromagnetic wave existing to the left of the quantum well consists of the incident and reflected waves .",
    "we will see later that the structure of the maxwell equations with the polarization , eq .",
    "( [ eq : app_polarization ] ) , dictates that the reflection coefficient has a @xmath190-functional singularity in the specular direction , @xmath191 .",
    "it is convenient to separate this singularity from the very beginning and to present the wave at the left - hand side of the quantum well in the following form . @xmath192",
    "a similar expression for the wave at the right - hand side of the quantum well containing only transmitted waves can be written as @xmath193    after the substitution of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : app_susc_av ] ) , ( [ eq : app_em ] ) , and ( [ eq : app_ep ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : app_fourier_eq ] ) we obtain an integral equation for the reflection and transmission coefficients , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 . assuming that the random process representing the fluctuating part of @xmath34 does not include constant or almost periodic realizations",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath196 , does not have @xmath190-like singularities in almost all realizations . in this case",
    ", the terms proportional to @xmath197 in this equation must cancel each other independently of other terms .",
    "this leads to a system of equations for @xmath198 and @xmath199 with the solutions @xmath200 where @xmath201 these expressions coincide with those of the effective medium approach , eq  ( [ eq : r_and_t ] ) , with an accuracy up to the phase factor , which does not appear in our derivation because of the @xmath190-functional approximation for the excitonic wave function .",
    "we can conclude , therefore , that the substitution of the average susceptibility into the maxwell equations allows us to conside the singular contribution to the reflection ( transmission ) only .",
    "the remaining terms , which are neglected in this approximation , give only small corrections to the reflection ( transmission ) in the specular direction .",
    "however , these terms become important when one considers scattering of light from quantum wells . another important assumption in our derivation",
    "concerns the spatial dispersion of the excitons .",
    "the existence of the singular contribution to the reflection ( transmission ) coefficients is directly related to neglecting any exciton motion in the in - plane direction .",
    "spatial dispersion of excitons will smooth out this singularity , and , therefore , the smoothness of experimental scattering spectra can be used , in principle , to estimate the exciton s mass .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that the outlined procedure does not involve any averaging of the electric field , and therefore the results obtained describe an intrinsically  deterministic \" contribution to the reflection and transmission coefficients rather than some _ average _ characteristics thereof .",
    "the existence of such a singular component in the scattering spectrum was mentioned in ref .   as well as observed in numerical calculations of ref .  .",
