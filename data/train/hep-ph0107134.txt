    "the thermodynamical properties of qcd is relatively unexplored subject which is nevertheless important in its own right @xcite .",

    "it is , however , highly nontrivial problem how to extract the thermodynamic quantities of qcd from these experiments .",
    "the critical exponents , for example , are defined in equilibrium statistical mechanics and it is not obvious how they can be revealed in such energetic collision experiments .",
    "therefore , it may be of help if we have a model which has the similar thermodynamic properties as qcd and at the same time simple enough to be tractable analytically .",
    "it was shown in their original work that the gross - neveu model has the same physical properties as qcd , asymptotic freedom , dimensional transmutation , and the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics of the gross - neveu model in the large-@xmath0 limit is discussed by wolff who worked out the structure of the phase diagram of chiral symmetry breaking on chemical potential - temperature plane , and in particular found a tricritical point @xcite .",
    "furthermore , chodos et al .",
    "have argued recently that by adding a pairing interactions the extended model admits a superconducting phase and possesses a very similar phase diagram with that of two - flavor massless qcd with chiral symmetry breaking and cooper pairing phases @xcite .",
    "therefore , the model is a good candidate for the theoretical laboratory of qcd for studies its thermodynamic properties .    in this paper",
    ", we study the thermodynamics of the original gross - neveu model and calculate the critical and tricritical exponents .",
    "it can be regarded as a preparatory study toward the discussions of how to extract thermodynamic quantities from robable dynamical processes in nonequilibrium or moderately equilibrium environments .",
    "a work has already been initiated aiming at pursuing such a goal @xcite .    in this paper , we restrict ourselves to the large-@xmath0 limit of the gross - neveu model . since it is a @xmath1-dimensional field theory , nontrivial phase structure at nonzero temperature is only possible in the large-@xmath0 limit due to the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite .",
    "the nature of the phenomenon and its interpretation as an `` almost spontaneous symmetry breaking '' has been discussed by witten @xcite .",
    "we think it sufficiently illuminative of the fact that the gross - neveu model in the large-@xmath0 limit provides a consistent theory which is usable as a theoretical laboratory for qcd .    in sec .  2 we review the gross - neveu model at finite chemical potential and temperature . in secs",

    "the index @xmath5 denotes flavor of fermions and runs from @xmath6 to @xmath0 .",
    "note that when we set @xmath7 the model has an invariance under the discrete chiral transformation @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the theory is renormarizable , by virtue of that the model is @xmath1-dimensional one .    to make the model easy to handle we introduce an auxiliary field @xmath10 by adding a term @xmath11 to the original lagrangian density @xmath12 .",
    "considering the fact that @xmath13 is an irrelevant constant we can use the lagrangian density @xmath14 without changing the dynamics of the original lagrangian density .",
    "for uniform vacuum we define the effective potential @xmath15 as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the effective action .",
    "now we take @xmath0 infinity . in the limit",

    "we see @xmath20 the vacuum expectation value @xmath21 is the physical mass of fermions and also order parameter for the discrete chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "so far we dealed with zero temperature case , but from now let us put the system into thermal bath of finite temperature @xmath22 . that is achieved by replacing @xmath23-integral with sum over matsubara frequencies as follows : @xmath24 where the boltzmann constant is set to be unity .",
    "after the replacements the effective potential becomes @xmath25 \\label{introt}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we must do renormalization , because the second term of ( [ introt ] ) clearly diverges .",
    "naively speaking , @xmath26 and @xmath4 are the parameters which we can use for renormalization .",
    "but it is better to regard @xmath26 and @xmath27 as independent parameters .",

    "the errors in the tricritical exponents are thereby estimated as less than a few % .",
    "our results indicate that all the critical and tricritical exponents of the gross - neveu model in the large-@xmath0 limit are given by the mean - field values @xcite .",
    "the reason may be that the fluctuations around a mean field are suppressed in the leading order of @xmath94 expansion .",
    "unfortunately , to calculate the next order of @xmath94 does not help because the critical temperature becomes exactly zero at finite @xmath0 in the gross - neveu model ; it is believed that the result of @xcite applies to any field theories in @xmath1-dimensions with short range interactions .",
    "then , what is the significance of the computation of critical exponents we have carried out in this paper ? it is to prepare for the study of the question of how equilibrium thermodaynamical quantities can be signaled and extracted from the experiments , as we have discussed in introduction .",
    "however , we have to keep in mind , despite their similarities , the following differences between the gross - neveu model and qcd .",
    "namely , we have no reason to expect the same numerical values of the critical and the tricritical exponents , and furthermore their physical nature may not be the same .",
    "it is because the gross - neveu model in the large-@xmath0 limit have the mean - field critical exponents , while qcd with two massless flavor is believed to belong to the universality class of @xmath95 spin model @xcite .",
