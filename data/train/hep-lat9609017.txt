    "in the last four years the ape group has been extensively studying lattice qcd in the quenched approximation .",
    "several simulations have been done to study weak matrix elements such as @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and to study semileptonic decays @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these simulations have allowed to study the dependence of the results on the spacing @xmath7 and to investigate finite size effects . here",
    "we present results for light meson masses and decay constants and baryon spectroscopy .",
    "the results have been obtained from eight sets of data at @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 using either the wilson action or the `` improved '' sw - clover action , in order to reduce @xmath11 effects .",
    "the parameters used in each simulation are listed in table  [ tab : latparams ] .",
    "the ape group has performed extensive comparisons on data extracted from smeared and non - smeared propagators and found no real improvement for lattices with a time extent of 64 at @xmath8 and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "note that the simulations have been performed at @xmath13 values of @xmath14 or larger .",
    "we have used the value of meson masses to read off the lattice baryon masses from the planes ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) and ( @xmath17 , @xmath16 ) . using the same values of @xmath18 used for meson masses",
    "we have obtained the results reported in table  [ tab : baryonsgev ] . for baryons we find very good agreement with the old ape @xcite data , while we find slightly larger values when comparing with jlqcd @xcite and lanl @xcite . also for baryon masses",
    "we can conclude that we do not see a dependence on @xmath7 and that we have an agreement with the experimental data of @xmath3 .",
