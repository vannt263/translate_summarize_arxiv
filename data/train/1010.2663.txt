    "boij  sderberg theory is the study of the cone of betti diagrams over the standard graded polynomial ring @xmath0 $ ] and  dually  the cone of cohomology tables of coherent sheaves on @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a field .",
    "the extremal rays of these cones correspond to special modules and sheaves : cohen  macaulay modules with pure resolutions ( definition  [ def : pure : res ] ) and supernatural sheaves ( definition  [ def : supernatural ] ) , respectively .",

    "though the statements of these two theorems are quite parallel , theorem  [ thm : poset : deg : main ] is far more subtle than theorem  [ thm : poset : root : main ] .",
    "theorem  [ thm : poset : root : main ] follows nearly directly from the eisenbud ",
    "schreyer pushforward construction of supernatural sheaves , but without modification , it is not clear how to compare the modules constructed in  @xcite .    we illustrate this via an example .",
    "let @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 be finite length modules with pure resolutions of types @xmath7 and @xmath8 , as constructed in  @xcite .",
    "we know of no method to produce a nonzero element of @xmath25 , even in this specific case .",
    "the difficulty here stems from differences in the constructions of @xmath10 and @xmath11 : the module @xmath10 is constructed by pushing forward a complex of projective dimension @xmath26 along @xmath27 , whereas @xmath11 is constructed by pushing forward a complex of projective dimension @xmath28 along @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the construction of  @xcite does not even suggest that theorem  [ thm : poset : deg : main ] ought to be true .",
    "our motivation for conjecturing the statement of theorem  [ thm : poset : deg : main ]  and the first key idea behind its proof  is based on a flexible version of the eisenbud ",
    "schreyer construction of pure resolutions .",
    "this is construction  [ modif : es ] below , and we show that the basic results of  @xcite can be adapted to this construction .",
    "this extension enables us to use a single projection map to simultaneously produce modules @xmath30 and @xmath31 with pure resolutions of types @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in the case under consideration",

    "]    we may then produce elements of @xmath34 by working with the complexes on the source @xmath35 of the projection map .",
    "however , finding such a nonzero element poses a second technical challenge in the proof of theorem  [ thm : poset : deg : main ] .",
    "this requires an explicit and somewhat delicate computation involving the pushforward of a morphism of complexes along the projection @xmath32 .",

    "in other words , while there exist graded modules whose betti diagrams can be written as a positive sum of pure tables in several ways , theorem  [ thm : poset : deg : main ] suggests that the most natural of these decompositions is the boij  sderberg decomposition produced by  @xcite*decomposition algorithm , and similarly for theorem  [ thm : poset : root : main ] and cohomology tables .",
    "a second implication involves the extension of boij  sderberg theory to more complicated projective varieties or graded rings .",
    "for instance , the cone of free resolutions over a quadric hypersurface ring of @xmath37 $ ] is described in  @xcite .",
    "the extremal rays in this case correspond to pure resolutions of finite or infinite length .",
    "we could thus consider a partial order defined in parallel to boij ",
    "sderberg s original definition ( based on the combinatorial data of a degree sequence ) , or , following our result , we could consider a partial order defined in terms of nonzero homomorphisms .",
    "these partial orders are different in this hypersurface case ; only the second definition leads to a decomposition algorithm for betti diagrams .",
    "see example  [ ex : hypersurface ] below for details .    for more general graded rings there even exist extremal rays that do not correspond to pure resolutions .",
    "( similar statements hold for more general projective varieties . )",
    "there is thus no obvious extension of boij ",
    "sderberg s original partial order to these cases .",
    "by contrast , the reinterpretations of @xmath3 provided by theorems  [ thm : poset : deg : main ] and  [ thm : poset : root : main ] are readily applicable to arbitrary projective varieties and graded rings .",
    "we discuss one such case in example  [ ex : bigraded ] .",
    "theorems  [ thm : poset : deg : main ] and  [ thm : poset : root : main ] hold over an arbitrary field @xmath2 , and their proofs involve variants of the constructions in  @xcite for supernatural sheaves and modules with pure resolutions .",
    "when @xmath38 , there also exist equivariant constructions of supernatural vector bundles  @xcite*thm .  6.2 and of finite length modules with pure resolutions  @xcite*thm .  0.1 .",
    "for these we prove the most natural equivariant analogues of our main results .",

    "an equivariant cohen",
    " macaulay module therefore has only two options for its support , and hence either has finite length or must be a free module .",
    "thus the finite length hypothesis in theorem  [ thm : equivariant : deg ] is the natural equivariant analogue of the cohen ",
    "macaulay hypothesis in theorem  [ thm : poset : deg : main ] .",
    "as above , the statement for pure resolutions is more subtle than the corresponding statement for supernatural vector bundles .",
    "the modules constructed in @xcite do not have nonzero equivariant homomorphisms between them , but the explicit combinatorics of the representation theory involved suggests a minor modification which does work .",
    "this also suggests how the maps should be defined in terms of the explicit presentation of the modules ; the remaining nontrivial step is to show that these maps are in fact well - defined .",
    "the main obstacle is that such maps must be compatible with the actions of both the general linear group and the symmetric algebra , and the interplay between the two is delicate .",
    "this key issue in the proof of theorem  [ thm : equivariant : deg ] is accomplished through a careful computation involving pieri maps ( combined with results from  @xcite ) .      in this paper , we first focus on the cone of betti diagrams for @xmath6 . in section  [ sec : prelim deg ] , we prove the reverse implications of theorems  [ thm : poset : deg : main ] and  [ thm : equivariant : deg ] .",
