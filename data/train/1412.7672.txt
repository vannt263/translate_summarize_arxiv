    "the discovery of the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite is a big boost for the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is arguably the prime candidate for beyond the sm physics and the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm ( mssm ) leads in natural way to the gauge coupling unification and provides a solution to the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "in addition , with the assumption of @xmath8parity conservation , mssm also provides a plausible candidate particle for dark matter , namely the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) . besides gauge coupling unification , models such as susy @xmath9 and susy @xmath10 ( 4 - 2 - 2 ) also suggest @xmath5 yukawa unification ( yu ) @xcite .",
    "the 4 - 2 - 2 structure allows us to consider non - universal gaugino masses with @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the soft supersymmetry breaking ( ssb ) mass terms respectively for @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 gauginos .",
    "supersymmteric @xmath18 offers a rich phenomenology , which can be examined in particular at the lhc .",
    "as far as we know , it is the only model which requires nlsp gluino to bring the relic abundance of lsp neutralino within the observed range of dark matter density in the presence of @xmath5 yu @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that @xmath5 yu in @xmath18 with the same sign ssb gaugino mass terms is compatible with neutralino dark matter through gluino coannihilation channel @xcite .",
    "considering opposite sign gauginos with @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the bilinear higgs mixing term ) in @xcite , @xmath5 yu consistent with known experimental constraints was achieved in @xmath18 for @xmath22 gev , as opposed to @xmath23 tev for the case of same sign gaugino masses . here",
    "@xmath24 denotes the common soft susy breaking scalar mass at @xmath25 .",
    "we show in this paper that relaxing @xmath5 yu to @xmath7 yu yields nlsp stop solutions in addition to nlsp gluino .",
    "we also find that the nlsp stop is nearly degenerate with the lsp neutralino , and hence the decay @xmath26 is the only channel kinematically allowed .",
    "the atlas collaboration has recently searched for such decays for the first time , and the results have excluded nlsp stop up to 270 gev for lsp neutralino with mass of about 200 gev @xcite .",
    "the cms collaboration has ruled out nlsp stop of mass @xmath27 250 gev , if the mass difference with lsp neutralino is less than 10 gev @xcite .",
    "we obtain relatively heavy ( @xmath28 gev ) nslp stop solutions , and we hope that future searches will be able to test our results . we also identify some solutions for which the mass difference between the nlsp and nnlsp is small .",
    "we find such solutions in both the nlsp stop and nlsp gluino scenarios .",
    "we also devote a section to @xmath5 yu in @xmath18 to update the results and compare with @xmath7 yu .",
    "we analyze the data that we obtain in the light of the current experimental constraints including the discovery of the higgs boson of mass close to 125 gev , flavor physics and wmap9 . the lhcb collaboration has recently discovered @xmath29 with the branching fraction @xmath30 @xcite that is consistent with the sm prediction of @xmath31 @xcite . in mssm",
    ", this flavor changing decay receives contributions from the exchange of the pseudoscalar higgs boson @xmath32 @xcite , which is proportional to @xmath33 . since @xmath5 yu requires large @xmath34 , it is important to see the impact of @xmath29 discovery on 4 - 2 - 2 parameter space in the presence of @xmath5 yu .",
    "the fundamental parameters of the model include    @xmath35    where @xmath24 is the universal ssb mass term for sfermions , and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the ssb gaugino mass terms for @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",

    "the outline for the rest of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : scan ] we summarize the scanning procedure and the experimental constraints applied in our analysis .",
    "we present our findings for @xmath7 and @xmath5 yu in section [ sec : results ] , and we also provide a table with five benchmark points that illustrate our results . our conclusion is summarized in section [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "we employ the isajet  7.84 package  @xcite to perform random scans over the parameter space given below . in this package , the weak scale values of gauge and third generation yukawa couplings",
    "are evolved to @xmath40 via the mssm renormalization group equations ( rges ) in the @xmath41 regularization scheme .",
    "we do not strictly enforce the unification condition @xmath42 at @xmath40 , since a few percent deviation from unification can be assigned to unknown gut - scale threshold corrections  @xcite . with the boundary conditions given at @xmath40 , all the ssb parameters , along with the gauge and yukawa couplings , are evolved back to the weak scale @xmath43 .    in evaluating yukawa couplings",
    "the susy threshold corrections  @xcite are taken into account at the common scale @xmath44 .",
    "the entire parameter set is iteratively run between @xmath43 and @xmath40 using the full 2-loop rges until a stable solution is obtained .",
    "to better account for leading - log corrections , one - loop step - beta functions are adopted for gauge and yukawa couplings , and the ssb parameters @xmath45 are extracted from rges at appropriate scales @xmath46 .",
    "the rge - improved 1-loop effective potential is minimized at an optimized scale @xmath47 , which effectively accounts for the leading 2-loop corrections .",
    "full 1-loop radiative corrections are incorporated for all sparticle masses .",
    "the requirement of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( rewsb )  @xcite puts an important theoretical constraint on the parameter space .",
    "another important constraint comes from limits on the cosmological abundance of stable charged particles  @xcite .",
    "this excludes regions in the parameter space where charged susy particles , such as @xmath48 or @xmath49 , become the lsp .",
    "we accept only those solutions for which one of the neutralinos is the lsp and saturates the dark matter relic abundance bound observed by wmap9 .",

    "yu , the third generation squarks are relatively light compared to those of the first two families . as a consequence , the gluino decay may lead to top - rich or bottom - rich decay signals . in the coannihilation region",
    "where @xmath79 , there is no phase - space for on - shell top quarks .",
    "the gluino in this case decays into b - jets , @xmath80 , which enables one to search for the nlsp gluino via multi - b jets , namely    @xmath81    such a scenario is favored for @xmath82 gev .",
    "note that the previous studies have ruled out a nlsp gluino with mass below 300 gev @xcite .",
    "we see from the top panels of figure [ btau - nlsp ] that the results for nlsp gluino with @xmath7 yu are similar to those obtained in the case of @xmath5 yu ( as shown in next section ) . for a nlsp gluino mass of order a tev or",
    "so the mass difference with the lsp dark matter neutralino should be at least 50 gev in order to be consistent with the wmap9 bound ( within @xmath61 ) on dark matter relic abundance .",
    "in the region where the nlsp gluino is almost degenerate with the lsp neutralino ( @xmath83 ) , the relic abundance of the latter is heavily reduced through coannihilation thus making it inconsistent with the wmap9 bound .",
    "it can be seen that our results with @xmath84 gev avoid the exclusion limits reported in @xcite .",
    "we also note that according to recent studies @xcite , our results can be readily tested at the lhc .",
    "it is indicated in @xcite that in certain scenarios an lsp with mass @xmath85 600 gev may evade the current lhc susy searches .",
    "the bottom panels indicate a distinct property of @xmath7 yu in @xmath18 not found in @xmath5 yu .",
    "we found in the @xmath7 case nlsp stop solution , with masses for the latter of order @xmath86 gev .",
    "note that nlsp stop solutions were previously found in the study of @xmath7 yu in susy @xmath87 in the mass range of @xmath88 gev with @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "our results are in agreement with the results previously reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the bottom right panel shows that the mass difference between the nlsp stop and lsp neutralino should be at least 40 gev to satisfy the wmap9 dark matter abundance bound within @xmath61 .",
    "the search for nlsp stop in such a scenario is challenging and has been implemented both at lep and tevatron @xcite .",
    "the two - body stop decay into a top quark and neutralino or a bottom quark and chargino , and the three - body decay channels @xmath90 , @xmath91 are kinematically not allowed .",
    "the loop induced two - body decay of nlsp stop , @xmath92 , is generally considered to overwhelm the four - body channel @xmath93 and tends to be the dominant nlsp stop decay mode  @xcite .",
    "results from searches for this decay channel using the tevatron data have been reported by both the cdf and d0 experiments @xcite .",
    "both model independent and model dependent studies of stop - neutralino coannihilation show that regions of the parameter space with stop - neutralino mass difference of @xmath94 are ruled out for @xmath95 gev @xcite .",
    "also , the first lhc searches for stop decaying into a charm quark and neutralino have recently been performed by the atlas collaboration @xcite and stop masses up to 270 gev have been excluded for lsp neutralino mass of about 200 gev . on the other hand , @xmath96= 250 gev with @xmath97 10 gev has been ruled out by a recent cms analysis @xcite .",
    "the nlsp stop mass obtained from our analysis lies well beyond these exclusion limits , but we hope that the future lhc searches will probe it .",
    "we also find regions in the parameter space in which the stop and gluino masses are almost degenerate .",
    "in this section , we revisit @xmath5 yu in @xmath18 to update the results taking account of the current experimental constraints , and then compare with the results obtained for @xmath7 yu . we quantify @xmath5 yu with @xmath99 defined in the same way as was done for @xmath7 yu :    @xmath100    we summarize our results for nlsp gluino in figure [ nlsp_g ] . color coding is the same as in figure [ btau - nlsp ] , except that the condition @xmath101 is replaced with @xmath102 .",

    "<S> we also identify regions of the parameter space in which the gluino and the lighter stop are closely degenerate in mass , interchangeably playing the role of nlsp and nnlsp .    </S>",
    "<S> we also update a previous study of @xmath5 yukawa unification and show that nlsp gluino of mass @xmath6 tev , with a mass difference between the gluino and neutralino of less than 80 gev , can be realized consistent with the current collider and astrophysical constraints . </S>",
