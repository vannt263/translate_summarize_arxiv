    "gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful means of astrophysical investigation .",
    "while baryonic tracers of the dark matter distribution commonly rely on strong simplifying assumptions , the gravitational deflection of light @xcite is sensitive solely to the overall incidence of any matter component along the line of sight . in practical applications ,",
    "the occurrence of strongly distorted images in the core of massive galaxy clusters can return important information about the inner structure of dark matter halos , while the weak systematic image distortion of large numbers of background galaxies allows to efficiently trace the outskirts of clusters and the large scale structure ( lss henceforth ) in general .    cosmic shear , that is weak gravitational lensing on cosmological scales , measures the redshift evolution of the lss in the universe weighted by a specific combination of angular diameter distances .",
    "hence it combines cosmological tests based on the geometry of the universe with tests based on the growth of structures .",
    "therefore , cosmic shear has long been recognized as an important tool for cosmology . in this paper we considered one particular cosmic shear statistic , namely the abundance of signal - to - noise ( s / n henceforth ) ratio peaks in wide field weak lensing maps . besides the intrinsic ellipticity distribution of background sources , peak counts are determined by the cosmological information encapsulated by the cosmic matter density fluctuations from linear to non - linear scales , namely lss fluctuations and cluster - sized dark matter halos . counting cosmic shear peaks without addressing their origin is not only easier to do than , for instance , counting weak lensing selected galaxy clusters , but also contains more cosmological leverage @xcite .    in the present work we applied the abundance of s / n peaks in cosmic shear maps to the issue of cosmological initial conditions , and in particular whether or not the primordial ( dark ) matter density fluctuations are distributed according to a gaussian distribution .",
    "it is now well established that primordial non - gaussianity has a considerable impact on different aspects of structure formation .",
    "specifically , a positively ( negatively ) skewed distribution of initial matter fluctuations would produce both a more ( less ) abundant galaxy cluster population and more ( less ) biased structures with respect to the underlying matter density field .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the peak statistics would return valuable constraints on the level and shape of primordial non - gaussianity .    besides several pioneering works @xcite , the problem of constraining deviations from primordial gaussianity by means different from the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) intrinsic anisotropies has recently attracted renewed attention in the literature , with efforts directed towards the abundance of non - linear structures ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , halo biasing ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , galaxy bispectrum @xcite , mass density distribution @xcite and topology @xcite , cosmic shear ( @xcite , pace et al .",
    "2010 ) , integrated sachs - wolfe effect @xcite , ly@xmath7 flux from low - density intergalactic medium @xcite , @xmath8 cm fluctuations @xcite and reionization @xcite .    as a specific application of our investigation on cosmic shear",
    ", we refer to a future half - sky optical / near - infrared imaging survey on the model of the esa cosmic vision proposal _",
    "euclid _ @xcite .",
    "our aim is to forecast the constraints on the level of primordial non - gaussianity that are expected by counting s / n peaks in cosmic shear maps that should be produced by _",
    "euclid_. we shall also investigate how these constraints change upon modification of several survey parameters and detection criteria , such as the imaging depth , the scale of optimal filtering , and the s / n threshold .    throughout this work we adopted for the reference gaussian model the cosmological parameter set given by the latest analysis of the wmap data @xcite , namely the matter density parameter @xmath9 , the cosmological constant density parameter @xmath10 , the baryon density parameter @xmath11 , the hubble constant @xmath12 , and the matter power spectrum normalization set by @xmath13 .",
    "the rest of our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sct : ng ]",
    "we summarize the various non - gaussian cosmologies adopted , while in section [ sct : observables ] we recall the modifications that these introduce to the cluster mass function , the large scale bias , and the matter power spectrum . in section [ sec : cosmolens ] we describe the various contributions to the weak lensing peak number counts and how they have been modeled . in section [ sct :",
    "effect ] we show the effect of primordial non - gaussianity on the abundance of cosmic shear peaks , while in section [ sct : constraints ] we report the fisher matrix analysis that we performed in order to forecast constraints on the initial conditions .",
    "finally in section [ sct : conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "extensions of the most standard model of inflation @xcite can produce substantial deviations from a gaussian distribution of primordial density and potential fluctuations ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the amount and shape of these deviations depend critically on the kind of non - standard inflationary model that one has in mind , as will be detailed later on .",
    "a particularly convenient ( although not unique ) way to describe generic deviations from a gaussian distribution consists in writing the gauge - invariant bardeen s potential @xmath14 as the sum of a gaussian random field and a quadratic correction @xcite , according to @xmath15 on sub - horizon scales the bardeen s potential equals minus the newtonian peculiar potential .",
    "the parameter @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ng ] ) determines the amplitude of non - gaussianity , and it is in general dependent on the scale .",
    "the symbol @xmath17 denotes convolution between functions , and reduces to standard multiplication upon constancy of @xmath16 . in the following we adopted the large - scale structure convention ( as opposed to the cmb convention ,",
    "see @xcite ; @xcite and @xcite ) for defining the fundamental parameter @xmath16 . according to this , the primordial value of @xmath14 has to be linearly extrapolated at @xmath18 , and as a consequence the constraints given on @xmath16 by the cmb have to be raised by @xmath19 per cent to comply with this paper s convention ( see also @xcite for a concise explanation ) .    in the case in which @xmath20 the potential @xmath14 is a random field with a non - gaussian probability distribution .",
    "therefore , the field itself can not be described by the power spectrum @xmath21 alone , rather higher - order moments are needed , for instance the bispectrum @xmath22 .",
    "the bispectrum is the fourier transform of the three - point correlation function @xmath23 and it can hence be implicitly defined as @xmath24    as mentioned above understanding the shape of non - gaussianity is of fundamental importance in order to pinpoint the physics of the early universe and the evolution of the inflaton field in particular .",
    "for this reason , in this work we considered four different shapes of the potential bispectrum , arising from different modifications of the standard inflationary scenario .",
    "we summarize them in the following , referring the reader to the quoted references and to @xcite for further details .",
    "the standard single - field inflationary scenario generates negligibly small deviations from gaussianity .",
    "these deviations are said to be of the local shape , and the related bispectrum of the bardeen s potential is maximized for _ squeezed _ configurations , where one of the three wavevectors has much smaller magnitude than the other two . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is usually assumed to be a constant , and it is expected to be of the same order of the slow - roll parameters @xcite , that are very close to zero .",
    "however non - gaussianities of the local shape can also be generated in the case in which an additional light scalar field , different from the inflaton , contributes to the observed curvature perturbations @xcite .",
    "this happens , for instance , in curvaton models @xcite or in multi - fields models @xcite . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath16 is allowed to be substantially different from zero .      in some inflationary models",
    "the kinetic term of the inflaton lagrangian is not standard , containing higher - order derivatives of the field itself .",
    "one significant example of this is the dbi model ( @xcite , see also @xcite ; @xcite ) . in this case the primordial bispectrum is maximized for configurations where the three wavevectors have approximately the same amplitude , and it is well represented by the template introduced by @xcite .",
    "given this , we have the freedom to insert a _ running _",
    "@xmath25 for @xmath16 , since this parameter is not forced to be constant in this case .",
    "the form we chose reads @xcite @xmath26 in all calculations that follow we considered this running as part of the equilateral bispectrum .",
    "this is important since different authors choose different runnings , or no running at all , for the equilateral shape .",
    "we adopted the exponent @xmath27 in the remainder of this work , that increase the level of non - gaussianity at scales smaller than that corresponding to @xmath28 mpc@xmath29 .",
    "this coincides with the larger multipole used in the cmb analysis by the wmap team @xcite , @xmath30 .      for deviations from gaussianity evaluated in the regular bunch - davies vacuum state ,",
    "the primordial potential bispectrum is of local or equilateral shape , depending on whether or not higher - order derivatives play a significant role in the evolution of the inflaton field .",
    "if the bunch - davies vacuum hypothesis is dropped , the resulting bispectrum is maximal for _ squashed _ configurations @xcite . @xcite found a template that describes very well the properties of this enfolded - shape bispectrum ( see however @xcite for a slightly different template of the physical model ) .",
    "a shape of the bispectrum can be constructed that is nearly _ orthogonal _ to both the local and equilateral forms @xcite .",
    "constraints on the level of non - gaussianity compatible with the cmb in the local , equilateral and orthogonal scenarios were recently given by the wmap team @xcite , while constraints on enfolded non - gaussianity from galaxy bias were given by @xcite +   + although there is no theoretical prescription against a running of the @xmath16 parameter with the scale in the enfolded and orthogonal shapes , we decided not to include one .",
    "the reason for this is that there is no first principle that can guide one in the choice of a particular kind of running , and until now no work has addressed the problem of a running for these shapes @xcite .",
    "moreover , we recall that the four non - gaussian shapes described above are not independent , rather the orthogonal shape can be obtained as a suitable linear combination of the equilateral and enfolded shapes @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we performed computations for the orthogonal model as well , since it gives a different signature on the evolution of the lss .",
    "primordial non - gaussianity produces modifications in the statistics of density peaks , resulting in differences in the mass function of cosmic objects and the bias of dark matter halos with respect to the underlying smooth density field . in the following we",
    "summarize how these modifications have been taken into account in the present work , and how they reflect into modifications to the matter power spectrum .      for the non - gaussian modification to the mass function of cosmic objects we adopted the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the main assumption behind it is that the effect of primordial non - gaussianity on the mass function is independent of the prescription adopted to describe the mass function itself .",
    "this means that , if @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the non - gaussian and gaussian mass functions , respectively , computed according to the @xcite formula , we can define a correction factor @xmath33 .",
    "then , the non - gaussian mass function computed according to an arbitrary prescription , @xmath34 can be related to its gaussian counterpart through @xmath35    in order to compute @xmath32 , and hence @xmath36 , @xcite performed an edgeworth expansion @xcite of the probability distribution for the smoothed density fluctuations field , truncating it at the linear term in @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting @xcite - like mass function reads @xmath38 \\left [    \\frac{d\\ln \\sigma_m}{dm } \\left (    \\frac{\\delta_\\mathrm{c}(z)}{\\sigma_m } + \\right.\\right .",

    "the function @xmath42 is the reduced skewness of the non - gaussian distribution , and the skewness @xmath43 can be computed as @xmath44 the last thing that remains to be defined is the function @xmath45 , that relates the density fluctuations smoothed on some scale @xmath46 to the respective peculiar potential , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the matter transfer function and @xmath49 is the fourier transform of the top - hat window function .    in this work we adopted the @xcite matter transfer function , with the shape factor correction of @xcite",
    "this reproduces fairly well the more sophisticated recipe of @xcite except for the presence of the baryon acoustic oscillation , that anyway is not of interest here .",
    "we additionally adopted as reference mass function the prescription of @xcite ( see @xcite for alternative prescriptions ) .",
    "other approaches also exist for computing the non - gaussian correction to the mass function , that give results in broad agreement with those obtained here @xcite .",
    "in computing the non - gaussian corrections to the mass function we have taken into account the correction to the critical overdensity for collapse suggested by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , according to which @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .",
    "recently much attention has been devoted to the effect of primordial non - gaussianity on halo bias , and the use thereof for constraining @xmath16 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , these works have shown that primordial non - gaussianity introduces a scale dependence on the large scale halo bias .",
    "this peculiarity allows to place already stringent constraints from existing data @xcite .",
    "the non - gaussian halo bias can be written in a relatively straightforward way in terms of its gaussian counterpart as @xcite @xmath52 ^ 2 \\;,\\ ] ] where the function @xmath53 encapsulates all the scale dependence of the non - gaussian correction to the bias , and reads @xmath54 d\\zeta \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 . in the simple case of local bispectrum shape",
    "it can be shown that the function @xmath53 should scale as @xmath56 at large scales , so that a substantial boost ( if @xmath57 ) in the halo bias is expected at those scales .",
    "for the gaussian bias @xmath58 we adopted the prescription of @xcite . in this case",
    ", since the correction to the gaussian bias is written in term of the gaussian bias itself , the ellipsoidal collapse correction suggested by @xcite is not necessary .",
    "it is interesting to note that , while for the first three non - gaussian shapes introduced in section [ sct : ng ] , a positive @xmath16 implies both a positive skewness of the matter density field and a positive correction to the large scale halo bias , the opposite is true for the fourth shape , the orthogonal one .",
    "this is a fact to be kept in mind when interpreting our results in the subsequent sections .",
    "another cosmological observable that is relevant for our purposes and gets modified in case of primordial non - gaussianity is the matter power spectrum .",
    "the latter requires a little bit more of care with respect to the mass function and linear bias .",
    "particularly , we should have a reliable way to parametrize the fully non - linear three - dimensional power spectrum , since part of the lensing signal is given by the integral thereof along the line of sight . in order to do that we followed the approach of @xcite ( and references therein ) and made use of the halo model in order to represent the matter power spectrum .",
    "the halo model @xcite is a physically motivated framework that allows to compute the correlation function of various lss tracers , including the dark matter particles themselves .",
    "it is based on the simple consideration that if all the matter in the universe is locked into halos , then the contribution to the correlation function comes from particle pairs sitting in separated halos at large scales and from particle pairs belonging to the same halo at small scales .",
    "accordingly , the power spectrum can be written as the sum of two terms describing the two contributions , @xmath59 , with @xmath60 ^ 2 dm \\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath61 ^ 2    p_\\mathrm{l}(k , z ) \\;.\\ ] ] in the previous set of equations @xmath62 is the linear matter power spectrum and @xmath63 is the fourier transform of the mean dark matter halo density profile which is also in principle modified by primordial non - gaussianity , as suggested in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we adopted a standard @xcite shape ( nfw henceforth ) for @xmath63 because the functional forms for the modified density profiles are proven to hold only for the local shape , and it is not clear whether this is the case for other shapes as well .",
    "therefore we ignored these changes , making our analysis more conservative , since a positive ( negative ) @xmath16 implies a more ( less ) centrally concentrated dark matter profile , and consequently an increment ( decrement ) in the number of peaks .",
    "for practical details on the implementation of the halo model we refer the interested reader to @xcite . here",
    "we just note that the mass function and the halo bias , both entering in the halo model , are modified by primordial non - gaussianity according to sections [ sct : mf ] and [ sct : bs ] .",
    "in this paper we focused on the number counts of weak lensing peaks , that directly reflect the distribution of dark matter fluctuations . counting",
    "directly the peaks allows to minimize the physical assumptions necessary in going from the adopted cosmological model to the data outcome . as a matter of fact we based the final results on dark matter physics only , by observing quantities insensitive to baryon physics and by relating the model prediction directly to the measured s / n ratios .",
    "in particular , the latter point avoids the difficult task of disentangling in a clear way the intrinsic nature of each single peak : noise fluctuation , lss line - of - sight superimposition or actual galaxy cluster .",
    "the deflection properties of isolated lenses are fully described by their two - dimensional lensing potential , @xmath64 where @xmath14 is the newtonian gravitational potential and @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 are the angular - diameter distances between the observer and the source , the observer and the lens , and the lens and the source , respectively . finally , @xmath68 represents the physical distance out to the source sphere .",
    "the potential @xmath69 relates the angular positions @xmath70 of a source and @xmath71 of its images on the observer s sky through the lens equation , @xmath72 . for sources such as distant background galaxies",
    "it is possible to linearize the lens equation such that the induced image distortion is expressed by the jacobian matrix @xmath73 in the previous equation , @xmath74 is the convergence , responsible for the isotropic magnification of an image relative to its source , and @xmath75 is the reduced shear , quantifying the observed distortion . here ,",
    "@xmath76 and @xmath77 are the two components of the complex shear , where a comma denotes standard differentiation with respect to coordinates on the lens plane .",
    "it is important to recall that since the angular size of the sources is unknown , only the reduced shear can be estimated starting from the observed ellipticity of the images .",
    "the abundance of s / n peaks in cosmic shear maps is determined by the sum of three separate contributions , that we describe in the following .    1 .",
    "the signal due to the occurrence of real non linear structures such as galaxy clusters . their abundance is evaluated in section  [ sct : mf ] and their shear profile can be evaluated analytically ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since the typical separation between the observed background galaxies is larger than the typical radius of the galaxy clusters critical curves we can assume @xmath78 throughout .",
    "the lensing signal due to chance projections of the lss , given by the effective convergence power spectrum @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the fully non - linear matter power spectrum discussed in section [ sec : matterpws ] , @xmath81 is the present - day matter - density parameter , @xmath82 is the hubble constant , @xmath83 is the speed of light , @xmath84 is the scale factor at the comoving distance @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the comoving distance to the horizon , @xmath87 is the comoving angular - diameter distance , and @xmath88 is the weight function encorporating the line - of - sight integral over the distribution of background sources @xmath89 , @xmath90 in our application we used a single ( the tangential ) component of the shear , for which the power spectrum reads @xmath91/2 .",
    "3 .   the observational noise contribution from the intrinsic ellipticity and finite number of background galaxies used to measure the shear signal , which has the white noise power spectrum @xmath92 determined by the number density @xmath93 of galaxies suitable for weak lensing measurements and the variance @xmath94 of their intrinsic ellipticity distribution .    since contributions ( ii ) and ( iii )",
    "are well represented by two independent gaussian random fields , their total power spectrum , is the sum of the two contributions , @xmath95 .",
    "a method to measure gravitational lensing signatures in optical / near - infrared catalogues of galaxies is the aperture mass @xcite .",
    "it is a weighted average of the tangential component of the shear @xmath96 over the position @xmath97 on the sky , @xmath98    where the radial filter function @xmath99 determines the statistical properties of the estimate @xmath100 we are interested in . in this paper",
    "we aim at constraining the deviations from primordial gaussianity , which mostly affect the non - linear part of structure formation and thus the high mass end of the mass function .",
    "therefore , we adopted the linear matched filter defined by @xcite which is designed to maximize the s / n ratio of non linear structures such as galaxy clusters , i.e those structures which are most sensitive to @xmath16 , @xmath101 here the filter is represented in the fourier space for convenience , @xmath102 is the fourier transform of the expected shear profile of individual halos , in our case the fourier transform of the nfw shear profile , and @xmath103 described in section [ sec : cosmoconstraints ] . note that the shape of the optimal filter depends on the assumed parameters for the nfw density profile , particularly on the angular size corresponding to the scale radius @xmath104 . moreover , since the filter is only a radial function , its fourier transform depends only on @xmath105    we further define the variance of the aperture mass estimate @xmath100 as @xmath106 so that it is related only to the non - cosmological signal component , i.e. @xmath107 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in practical applications @xmath100 is approximated as @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the tangential ellipticity of a galaxy image located at the position @xmath110 with respect to @xmath71 , and which provides an estimate for @xmath96 .",
    "once the lensing signals and the observational strategy have been defined ( see sections  [ sec : cosmoconstraints ] and [ sec : filter ] ) , the weak lensing number counts can be predicted as the sum of two independent components . on one hand the non - linear structures , i.e. galaxy clusters , whose detection depends on their intrinsic abundance given by the mass function discussed in section  [ sct : mf ] , and by their observed s / n ratio depending on their expected signal @xmath100 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : a ] ) and variance @xmath111 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : avariance ] ) . on the other hand the lensing lss and instrumental noise which are well approximated by a gaussian random field and for which their number counts above a specific threshold s / n@xmath112 can be easily predicted , @xmath113 as shown by @xcite .",
    "here @xmath114 , defined as @xmath115 is the lss plus noise lensing field variance which depends on the observational noise , the convergence power spectrum and the adopted filter .",
    "note that , by approximating this therm as a gaussian random field , the primordial non - gaussianity is accounted through the lss power spectrum only so that its leverage is not fully included . for our purpose",
    "this is a negligible approximation since we anyway expect this effect to be small and put our final predictions on a conservative side .",
    "these two contributions carry complementary cosmological information , thus the statistics of cosmic shear peaks are in principle valuable cosmological tools @xcite .",
    "the two cosmological contributions to the abundance of cosmic shear peaks are exemplified in the left panel of figure  [ fig : shearpeaks ] for the reference gaussian cosmological model . for this figure and in the rest of the work we adopted the source redshift distribution observationally derived by @xcite , while their average surface number density is @xmath116 arcmin@xmath117 , a level achieved by actual weak lensing surveys and which should be reached by euclid ( a prediction for a sample of existing and future weak lensing surveys is given by @xcite ) . as expected",
    ", the chance alignment of the lss dominates the counts at small s / n ratio values , while the contribution coming from the occurrence of real dark matter clumps starts to be relevant at around s / n@xmath118 and dominates at higher s / n values .",
    "we additionally show in the right panel of the same figure the total number counts expected for three different scale radii of the optimal filter .",
    "as it can be noted , the larger the scale , the larger the contribution of galaxy clusters with respect to the lss and the noise , although the latter remains always dominant at smaller , but still large , s / n .",
    "this behavior is expected because for larger filter scales the detections will have larger areas , thus increasing their blending where their number density is higher , typically at lower s / n . also , the overall s / n ratio values at higher s / n are expected to be larger , since a larger filter scale implies a better statistic for the background galaxies reducing their shot noise and intrinsic ellipticity .",
    "these features are ensured by the adopted optimal filter which maximizes the cluster signal against the one of lss and noise . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we shall refer mainly to a scale radius of @xmath119 , unless explicitly noted otherwise .",
    "the effect of primordial non - gaussianity on the statistics of shear peaks is exemplified in figure [ fig : shearpeaksratio ] for the four different non - gaussian shapes that were discussed in section  [ sct : ng ] , and for levels of non - gaussianity @xmath120 and @xmath121 . as it can be seen , the effect of non - gaussianity is more evident at high values of s / n ratio , where it is mostly given by the effect on the mass function of dark matter halos .",
    "we remind the reader that our predictions regarding the impact of primordial non - gaussianity at the s / n ratios dominated by the lss are conservative as discussed in section  [ sec : expectedpeaks ] .",
    "also , as expected , the effect is largest for local non - gaussianity for which , at high s / n , the counts can be modified by up to @xmath122 for @xmath123 and smallest for the orthogonal shape , where it barely reaches @xmath124 . for the orthogonal shape positive values of @xmath16 provide a decrement in the number counts of shear peaks at high s / n values , while the opposite is true for all other models .",
    "this agrees with the behavior of the skewness that has been discussed in section [ sct : ng ] .",
    "although the effect of non - gaussianity is substantially reduced for shapes different from the local one , it is likely that useful constraints can be put on @xmath16 for these shapes as well .",
    "for instance in the orthogonal case , @xmath16 is constrained only at the level of a few hundreds by cmb data @xcite .",
    "our prediction is compatible with the recent work of @xcite , who found an effect on the shear peaks number counts at the level of @xmath2 for the highest significance detections .",
    "although a direct comparison of the two works is not possible due to different source redshift distributions , different detection schemes , etc . , we actually verified that by reducing the scale radius of the optimal filter down to @xmath125 the effect is raised to @xmath2 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the two works are in broad agreement for the local non - gaussian model concerning the magnitude of the effect .",
    "this is reassuring , since the two results are based on quite different premises and adopt different methodologies : we opted for semi - analytic modeling , while @xcite resorted to the use of cosmological simulations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : shearpeaksratio_sigma8 ] we show the ratio of the peak number counts in non - gaussian cosmologies with local shape ( @xmath126 ) to the same quantities in the reference gaussian case adopting three different values of the power spectrum amplitude @xmath127 for all models .",
    "we considered @xmath128 fluctuations in the value of @xmath127 , comparable with the @xmath4 uncertainty around the fiducial value derived by the wmap-7 release .",
    "quite unexpectedly , the effect of primordial non - gaussianity is higher for lower values of @xmath127 .",
    "we interpret this fact as due to the delayed structure formation implied by a lower normalization .",
    "this allows the effect of primordial non - gaussianity on the matter density field to be retained for a longer time by the lss , with the consequence that the s / n peak number counts are slightly more affected .",
    "in other words , since with a lower @xmath127 the onset of non - linear evolution is delayed , gravitational clustering has less time to erase the cosmological initial conditions .",
    "in this section we use a fisher - matrix analysis to estimate the confidence level in the @xmath129 plane , as obtained with the weak lensing number counts .",

    "euclid_. concerning the scale radius of the optimal filter , by increasing it we get a significant tightening of the constraints on @xmath16 , while those on @xmath127 are almost insensitive to it",
    ".            now that we have an overall picture of the dependence on the survey characteristics , we used the numerical simulations including the full covariance matrix to obtain our final results . in figure",
    "[ fig : ellipse - sn ] we show the @xmath4 confidence levels in the @xmath150 plane obtained for the non - gaussian model with local shape when different minimum s / n ratios are considered .",
    "it is in fact common practice for actual applications to use only those detections with s / n larger then s / n@xmath151 in the attempt to isolate galaxy clusters from all other signal components .",
    "here we show how the cut - off level affects the final results .",
    "the related loss of information happens because the presence of non linear structures affects the statistic of weak lensing maps also at lower signal to noise ratios where they can not be seen as clear single detections but where their presence is still visible .",
    "moreover , although this effect is negligible for the @xmath16 estimates , chance projection of the lss dominates at these small s / n values , and still contains cosmological information .",
    "figure [ fig : ellipse - sn ] shows that adopting a conservative choice for the minimum s / n value can results in a loss of constraining power of a factor @xmath142 on @xmath16 and a factor of @xmath118 on @xmath127 .",
    "thus , particular care have to be used when defining the detection selection criteria since data can be fully exploited only if lower s / n levels , e.g. s / n@xmath152 , are used .",
    "this would be possible only if a deep statistical understanding of data is achieved together with a detailed modeling .",
    "a tentative to go in this direction is provided by the analytic prediction for weak lensing number counts proposed by @xcite but which still needs to improve some of the adopted approximations .",
    "finally we show in figures [ fig : ellipsemodels ] the constraints for @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 confidence levels with s / n@xmath156 for the four different primordial bispectrum shapes discussed in section [ sct : ng ] .",
    "we adopted the optimal filter with scale of @xmath157 .",
    "as one could naively expect , while the constraints on @xmath127 are rather insensitive to the adopted shape of the primordial bispectrum , the constraints on @xmath16 vary widely with it .",
    "particularly , while the @xmath4 error @xmath158 is at the level of a few tens for the local and equilateral shapes , it grows up to @xmath6 for the enfolded and orthogonal shapes .",
    "these constraints are not competitive with what is expected by future cmb and galaxy clustering probes , and are only comparable with the expected performance of the weak lensing power spectrum @xcite analysis . the main reason for this results is that in this work we did not use the full redshift information which is otherwise included in the other works and which could be included by the use of lensing tomography .",
    "recently , @xcite have shown that using the correlation function of weak lensing - selected clusters it is possible to push the bounds on @xmath16 below what would be achieved without redshift information .",
    "in addition , it is likely that a combination of these diverse probes can reduce the error on @xmath16 substantially .",
    "we plan to investigate this synergy in a future work .    the constraints on the amplitude of the matter power spectrum , @xmath159 are themselves quite competitive .",
    "for instance , recently @xcite forecasted an error on @xmath127 of @xmath160 by using the shape and position of the baryon acoustic oscillation measured by _",
    "euclid_. despite the fact that @xcite let all the cosmological parameters free to vary , while we limit our analysis to @xmath16 and @xmath127 , these numbers argue for our constraints on the amplitude of the matter power spectrum being sound .",
    "the degeneracy between the level of primordial non - gaussianity and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum is also easy to understand , since increases in both @xmath16 and @xmath127 bring an increment in the large scale matter power spectrum and the occurrence of massive dark matter halos .",
    "the only exception to this is given by the orthogonal model , because in this case a positive @xmath16 implies a decrement in both the abundance of cosmic structures and the large scale bias of dark matter halos . for further clarity , in figure [ fig : compare ]",
    "we show the @xmath4 confidence levels in the @xmath150 plane for the four primordial bispectrum shapes considered in this work together .",
    "this figure allows a more direct comparison between the different models , and highlights the differences in constraining the level of primordial non - gaussianity between them .",
    "confidence levels in the @xmath150 plane for all the four shapes of the primordial bispectrum considered in this work , as labeled ]",
    "the abundance of s / n peaks in cosmic shear maps contains cosmological information through the mass function of large dark matter clumps and the projection of the large scale matter distribution .",
    "we considered the effect of deviations from primordial gaussianity on this particular weak lensing statistic .",
    "analytic modeling of the galaxy cluster mass function , the large scale halo bias , and the fully non - linear power spectrum of dark matter was implemented , where the effect of primordial non - gaussianity could be straightforwardly introduced .",
    "we predicted analytically and through simple numerical simulations the expected weak lensing peaks number counts and covariance for different weak lensing filters .",
    "we then performed a fisher matrix analysis in order to forecast the constraints on the level of primordial non - gaussianity @xmath16 and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum @xmath127 that could be expected by counting the cosmic shear peaks for different survey configurations , i.e. depth and field of view , in particular for the half - sky maps expected by the proposed esa space mission _",
    "euclid_. our principal results can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "primordial non - gaussianity affects mainly the high s / n part of the shear peak number counts , where the signal is dominated by the occurrence of real cluster - sized dark matter halos . for the local primordial bispectrum shape and according to the adopted weak lensing filter the number counts can be modified by @xmath161 at s / n @xmath162 if @xmath163 , and by up to @xmath2 for @xmath164 . for the enfolded and orthogonal bispectrum shapes , the modification reaches at most @xmath165 for @xmath166 . *",
    "generically an increment in @xmath16 corresponds to an increment in the number counts of cosmic shear peaks , and the other way round , compatibly with the effect of primordial non - gaussianity on the cluster mass function .",
    "the exception to this is given by the orthogonal model , for which it is known that the skewness and scale - dependent bias correction are negative for positive @xmath16 , and vice - versa .",
    "* we show that considering only cosmic shear peaks with s / n larger than @xmath167 , as it is costume in actual applications , leads to a loss of cosmological information because the lss and , more importantly , the low mass clusters contributions are ignored .",
    "in particular the latter is important in constraining @xmath168 even if these structures can not be detected individually .",
    "thus , data can be better exploited if lower s / n levels , e.g. s / n@xmath169 , are used . for this achievement , a deep statistical understanding and a detailed data modeling",
    "are necessary . * in terms of joint constraints for @xmath16 and",
    "@xmath127 only a marginal benefit is obtained by increasing the background galaxy number density above @xmath149 arcmin@xmath117 , while it is more convenient to go for wider fields of view . by increasing the scale radius of the optimal filter we obtained a significant improvement for the @xmath16 constraints , while those on @xmath127 are almost unaffected . * counting cosmic shear peaks in future wide field optical / near - infrared surveys on the model of _ euclid _ can constrain @xmath16 to the level of a few tens for the local and orthogonal shapes , and to the level of @xmath6 for the enfolded and orthogonal shapes .",
    "constraints on @xmath127 are at the level of @xmath170 and are instead rather insensitive to the assumed shape of the primordial bispectrum .    the results presented in this work show that the abundance of cosmic shear peaks can be a powerful mean for constraining cosmology .",
    "forecasted errors on the level of primordial non - gaussianity for a _ euclid_-like survey are competitive with similar constraints given by weak lensing tomography and the correlation function of weak lensing selected galaxy clusters . at the same time",
    ", counting cosmic shear peaks irrespective of their nature is much easier and less subject to systematics compared with other probes where the nature of each lensing peak , resulting by lss or galaxy clusters , has to be determined .",
