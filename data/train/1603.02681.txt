    "the hubbard model  @xcite is the archetypal model for studying strongly - correlated systems and their phase transitions in condensed matter physics .",
    "its hamiltonian is expressed as @xmath0 where @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) annihilates ( creates ) a fermion with spin @xmath3 on site @xmath4 , @xmath5 is the number operator , @xmath6 is the onsite coulomb interaction , @xmath7 denotes nearest neighbors , and @xmath8 is the corresponding hopping integral .",
    "the two - dimensional ( 2d ) versions have become _ de facto _ models to describe mott transition  @xcite , potentially high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite , and a wealth of other low - temperature phases in materials such as cuprates  @xcite , pnictides  @xcite , iron - selenides  @xcite , and heavy fermions  @xcite , to name a few  @xcite .",
    "other than a variety of numerical techniques that have been developed over the past three decades to solve this often unforgivingly difficult model  @xcite , in recent years , the community has witnessed remarkable efforts in simulating , among other correlated theoretical models , the hubbard model , using ultracold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the observation of the mott transition with fermions as well as bosons in different dimensions  @xcite provided the added impetus for attempts to bring down the temperature to a range relevant to superconductivity .",
    "even though the latter has proven extremely difficult , there has been significant progress along the way .",
    "some experimental groups have focused on the three - dimensional ( 3d ) system  @xcite , where the nel transition to the long - range antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase is expected to occur at temperatures about an order of magnitude larger than that predicted for superconductivity to develop in the two - dimensional system  @xcite . in a groundbreaking study  @xcite , long - range af correlations near the critical temperature of the 3d model were observed for the first time .",
    "this milestone was reached through characterization of the experimental system via comparisons of observed thermodynamic properties to results from two state - of - the - art numerical techniques , the determinant quantum monte carlo ( dqmc )  @xcite and the numerical linked - cluster expansion ( nlce ) @xcite .",
    "the latter can provide exact results in the thermodynamic limit , for a wide range of temperatures and average densities .",
    "the 3d hubbard model has long been a playground for numerical methods to study finite - temperature critical behavior in a system where the electronic correlations can be tuned .",
    "its finite - temperature phase transition to the nel ordered phase has been studied carefully by a variety of numerical techniques  @xcite . however , as these methods are often not well - equipped to handle the strong - coupling regime of the model ( @xmath9 ) , the complete mapping of the ground state phase diagram in the temperature - interaction plane has been assisted by an asymptotic behavior based on the critical temperature of the low - energy theory in the limit of large interaction strengths  @xcite .    here , we use the nlce to explore the thermodynamic properties , such as the heat capacity , double occupancy , and spin correlations , of the 3d hubbard model in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "an outstanding advantage of the nlce for the hubbard models over more typical methods is that one will have access to lower temperatures at larger values of the coulomb repulsion  @xcite .",
    "this , in turn allows us to explore the divergent behavior of the spin structure factor by using different extrapolation techniques to obtain reliable estimates for the nel temperature ( @xmath10 ) in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "we find that our estimates match the @xmath10 calculated using methods based on quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) within the errorbars in the intermediate - coupling regime ( @xmath11 ) , and are in very good agreement with the asymptotic form for @xmath9 .",
    "we further confirm our extrapolation schemes in obtaining the nel transition temperature for the 3d antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , for which the nlce can be carried out to significantly higher orders .",
    "the critical temperature is well known for this model from a large - scale qmc study  @xcite .",
    "to study hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) , we have implemented the nlce for the 3d cubic lattice . in the nlce , an extensive property of the lattice model in the thermodynamic limit , normalized to the number of sites ,",
    "is expressed in terms of contributions from all finite clusters , up to a certain size , that can be embedded in the lattice .",
    "these contributions are calculated according to the inclusion - exclusion principle .",
    "the method can be summarized in the following series : @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents the extensive property _ per site _ in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath14 is the symbolic lattice size ( @xmath15 ) , and the contribution of cluster @xmath16 to the property , also known as the _ weight _ , is shown by @xmath17 . if the model does not break translational symmetry of the underlying lattice , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) can be simplified to a sum , without the @xmath18 factor , over only those clusters that are not related by translational symmetry .",
    "further , if the model does not break point group symmetries of the underlying lattice , the contribution of all clusters that are related by point group symmetry can be expressed as one term that is , the weight of one of the clusters , times a _ multiplicity _ factor , which represents the number of ways one can obtain a distinct cluster by applying point group symmetry operations to that cluster .    equation ( [ eq : main ] ) is a cluster expansion  @xcite that can be written not only for the infinite lattice , but also for a finite cluster  @xcite .",
    "we use this fact to find the weights .",
    "consider , for example , the equation for @xmath19 , the property calculated for a finite cluster @xmath16 : @xmath20 where we have intentionally separated the weight of @xmath16 itself , with @xmath21 running over all subclusters of @xmath16 ( clusters obtained by removing different number of sites from @xmath16 ) .",
    "note that @xmath19 is not normalized by the number of sites . by reordering the terms in this equation ,",
    "we can write the weight of each cluster as its property less the contributions of its subclusters : @xmath22 the above equation provides a recursive method for calculating all the weights up to a certain size ; we start with the smallest cluster , a single site , which does not have any subclusters , i.e. , @xmath23 , and generate larger clusters by adding sites to it one by one in the so - called _ site expansion _ nlce .",
    "we carry out this expansion to the 9th order , which means we will work with clusters as large as 9 sites .",
    "nlces use the same basis as the high - temperature series expansions ( htses )  @xcite .",
    "however , the calculation of the extensive quantities at the level of individual clusters [ @xmath19 ] is left to an exact numerical method , such as the exact diagonalization , as opposed to a perturbative expansion in terms of inverse temperature , as done in the htses . despite the lack of an explicit small parameter , having",
    "a finite series inevitably leads to the loss of convergence below a certain temperature , where the correlations in the system extend beyond a length of the order of the largest sizes considered .",
    "however , the exact treatment of clusters leads to minimum convergence temperatures that are lower than those of htse with a comparable order ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cv ] ) .",
    "we study the specific heat , @xmath25 , which can be obtained within nlce from the knowledge of the energy , density , and their correlation , without any numerical derivatives or numerical integration  @xcite , double occupancy , @xmath26 ( site averaged ) , the nearest - neighbor spin correlations , @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 component of the spin operator at site @xmath4 , and the spin structure factor , @xmath30 at @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the displacement vector for site @xmath33 on the lattice .",
    "we denote the latter by @xmath34 . in the disordered phase at high temperatures ,",
    "it remains finite in the thermodynamic limit , while its divergence at low temperatures is the indication for af ordering in the system .",
    "similar to the analytic pad approximations used extensively in htses , here we take advantage of two _ numerical _ resummation techniques to improve the convergence of our series at low temperatures .",
    "we use the euler algorithm  @xcite to resum the last 6 terms of the series or the wynn algorithm  @xcite with 3 and 4 cycles of improvement ( details about these techniques and their use for nlces can be found in refs .  ) . except for the staggered structure factor , for which we know the euler algorithm does not perform as well as the wynn ( see the discussion surrounding fig .  [",
    "fig : saft ] ) , we take the average of properties from the last two orders after the euler , and the last orders of each of the wynn resummations as our best estimate . to quantify our confidence in the accuracy of the resummed results ,",
    "we define a `` confidence region '' around this average where all four values that contribute to the average fall .",
    "thus , the errorbars in our figures simply mark the boundaries of this region and should not be mistaken as statistical errorbars .",
    "the nlce makes the study of thermodynamic quantities in the thermodynamic limit efficient and easy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv ] , we show the specific heat of the half - filled system as a function of temperature for an interaction strength that ranges from @xmath35 in the weak - coupling regime to @xmath36 in the strong - coupling regime . we have set @xmath37 , and @xmath38 as the unit of energy throughout the paper .",
    "since the properties of the clusters in the series are calculated using exact diagonalization , we obtain information at all temperatures and chemical potential values for a given @xmath6 in a single run , as opposed to qmc - based methods in which each temperature and chemical potential has to be treated separately . for this reason",
    ", one can choose a fine temperature and chemical potential grid to better capture the details and trends in quantities of interest in different regions of the parameter space ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : cv ] ) .",
    "this is also of great importance for modeling of systems in optical lattice experiments .",
    "for instance , because of the existence of a trapping potential , theoretical modeling of the inhomogeneous system is often done through proper averaging of properties over a set of homogeneous systems whose chemical potentials vary only slightly from one to the next .",
    "this is known as the local density approximation .",
    "the other advantage of exact diagonalization is that one has full access to the partition function of the clusters , and so , there is no need to employ numerical integration or derivations , which can introduce systematic errors , for the calculation of @xmath25 , or the entropy .        as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv ] , we capture the exact location of the high - temperature peak in @xmath25 for all values of @xmath6 shown , and reach temperatures as low as @xmath40 for the largest @xmath6 of 20 .",
    "the high - temperature peak marks the temperature region where local moments form as the system is cooled . like for the 2d counterpart  @xcite , and",
    "as expected from the increasingly dominant mott physics , this region moves to higher temperatures as the interaction is increased . on the other hand ,",
    "the minimum convergence temperature of the series decreases as @xmath6 increases . in the strong - coupling regime , this temperature is proportional to the exchange interaction of the effective heisenberg model , which scales as @xmath41 .",
    "one can see that the lowest convergence temperatures achieved with the nlce before resummations ( thin dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv ] ) are generally lower than those achieved using the htse up to the 10th order ( red thin solid lines ) , especially in the intermediate - coupling regime , @xmath42 .",
    "a feature of @xmath25 that can be resolved here with high accuracy is the unique crossing point of curves for different @xmath6 around @xmath43 , which persists for @xmath44 .",
    "the physical implications of this phenomenon , which is ubiquitous in strongly - correlated systems and has also been observed to persist for @xmath6 up to the bandwidth in the two - dimensional version of the hubbard model  @xcite are discussed in ref .",

    "( b ) nearest - neighbor spin correlations at half filling vs @xmath6 .",
    "similarly to the 2d model  @xcite , they initially rise in the weak - coupling regime by increasing the interaction strength and eventually decrease as @xmath41 in the strong - coupling regime .",

    "half filling , the uncorrelated limit of @xmath46 at high temperatures is @xmath47 regardless of @xmath6 .",
    "however , the larger the @xmath6 , the faster @xmath46 drops upon decreasing the temperature . quantum fluctuations leave the system with a nonzero and @xmath6-dependent double occupancy even at @xmath48 . away from half filling , the uncorrelated values of @xmath46 vary as @xmath49 with the electron density , @xmath50 , and the ground state values are expected to remain nonzero .",
    "a clear upturn in @xmath46 upon decreasing the temperature is found after the initial drop at all fillings , at least with @xmath51 at the accessible temperatures .",
    "close to half filling , this phenomenon can be attributed to the tendency of the system to order antiferromagnetically , thus , giving way to a larger number of allowed virtual hoppings to neighboring sites that were otherwise forbidden by the pauli s exclusion principle in the uncorrelated system  @xcite . sufficiently far from half filling , or in the weak - coupling regime  @xcite",

    "[ fig : d](a ) , where we show @xmath46 at half filling as a function of @xmath6 in a low - temperature window . the large fluctuations of data at @xmath58 point to the lack of convergence in the series at the lowest temperatures .",
    "regardless , the double occupancy clearly decreases rapidly by increasing @xmath6 with no sharp features or outstanding variation in its behavior as the temperature is decreased from @xmath59 to @xmath60 . in the same time , short - range af correlations display a non - monotonic behavior .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath61 , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d](b ) , initially increases with increasing @xmath6 , and then slowly decreases as @xmath6 further increases in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "this behavior can be understood by considering the interplay between moment formation , which takes place at higher temperatures for larger values of @xmath6 , and the strength of the exchange interaction between moments , which decreases with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "the overall behavior is reminiscent of that for the 2d system  @xcite .",
    "we find that the peak at @xmath45 becomes sharper as the temperature is decreased , hinting that short - range correlations may eventually be strongest at a slightly larger interaction strength than the one corresponding to the largest nel transition temperature to the long - range order ( @xmath54 )  @xcite .    in figs .",

    "[ fig : saft ] , we show the temperature dependence of @xmath34 for various interaction strengths .",
    "the euler resummation technique behaves poorly for fast growing properties such as @xmath34 whose terms in the series at a given @xmath62 do not necessarily alternate in sign . for this reason",

    "the reliability of the wynn resummations for @xmath34 have been confirmed also through previous comparisons to dqmc results  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the lowest convergence temperature decreases by increasing @xmath6 , something we already saw for @xmath25 in fig .",
    "[ fig : cv ] . of course",
    ", this does not coincide with a larger @xmath34 at low temperatures for a larger @xmath6 in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "in fact , the extent of the correlations in the system , which essentially controls the convergence of the nlce , is becoming smaller as the interaction is getting stronger .",
    "the model has a finite - temperature phase transition to the long - range nel ordered state .",
    "therefore , the structure factor for any @xmath64 is expected to diverge at a nonzero temperature .",

    "<S> we employ the numerical linked - cluster expansion to study finite - temperature properties of the uniform cubic lattice hubbard model in the thermodynamic limit for a wide range of interaction strengths and densities . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out the expansion to the 9th order and find that the convergence of the series extends to lower temperatures as the strength of the interaction increases , giving us access to regions of the parameter space that are difficult to reach by most other numerical methods . </S>",
    "<S> we study the precise trends in the specific heat , the double occupancy , and magnetic correlations at temperatures as low as 0.2 of the hopping amplitude in the strong - coupling regime . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in this regime , accurate estimates for transition temperatures to the nel ordered phase , in agreement with the predicted asymptotic behavior , can be deduced from the low - temperature magnetic structure factor . </S>",
    "<S> we also find evidence for possible instability to the magnetically ordered phase away from , but close to , half filling . </S>",
    "<S> our results have important implications for parametrizing fermionic systems in optical lattice experiments and for benchmarking other numerical methods . </S>"
