    "the problem of first - principles calculation of electronic conduction in molecular systems is of longstanding interest . over the last decade ,",
    "advances in experimental techniques have allowed for fundamental studies of electron transport through few or even individually contacted molecules .",
    "the transport mechanisms observed in molecular junctions range from ballistic@xcite over off - resonant tunneling@xcite to the strong correlation kondo and coulomb blockade regime@xcite to vibration assisted hopping@xcite .",
    "the former two belong to the phase - coherent transport regime characteristic of relatively short molecules ( as opposed to molecular wires@xcite ) with good `` chemical '' contact to the electrodes and is the main focus of the present work .",
    "the lack of control over the atomistic details of the metal - molecule interface introduces a strong statistical element in measurements on single - molecule junctions which masks the relation between atomic structure and measured conductance .",
    "for example , published conductance values for the gold / benzenedithiol model system vary by several orders of magnitude , although recent independent studies of this system seem agree on a value around @xmath1 ( @xmath2)@xcite .",
    "it is , however , not clear which structure is responsible for this `` typical '' conductance and recent experimental and theoretical work point to complex gold / thiolate structures involving two molecules bonding the same au adatom@xcite .",
    "scanning tunneling microscope experiments in solution have shown that the use of amino rather than thiol anchoring groups leads to more well defined junction properties@xcite and a conductance around ( or just below ) @xmath1 has also been reported for the gold / benzenediamine junction@xcite .",
    "this was , however , not confirmed by independent break junction experiments in vacuum@xcite .",
    "the uncertainties related to the junction atomic structure renders theoretical benchmark calculations more important and more challenging at the same time . here",
    "progress has been hampered by the inability of conventional density functional theory ( dft ) methods , which for long have been the workhorse and the state of the art for quantum transport calculations@xcite , to reproduce the conductance measured for even the simplest molecular tunnel junctions@xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the most succesful studies have focused on qualitative trends in the dependence of conductance on e.g. molecular conformation@xcite , molecular length@xcite , side group functionalizations@xcite , or have focused on properties independent of the numerical value of the conductance like molecular vibrations@xcite .",
    "the main shortcoming of the dft approach has been attributed to its band gap problem , i.e. the fact that dft tends to underestimate energy gaps@xcite , and therefore overestimates the conductance .",
    "attempts to overcome this problem within a single - particle framework have mainly focused on self - interaction correction schemes@xcite .",
    "the well known success of the many - body gw method@xcite for quasiparticle ( qp ) bandstructure calculations has recently inspired its application to ( simplified ) transport problems@xcite .",
    "the fact that the gw approximation succesfully describes systems with highly diverse screening properties ranging from metals@xcite over semiconductors@xcite to molecules@xcite is essential for a correct description of metal - molecule interfaces where the electronic character changes from metallic to insulating over a few angstrom . in particular , screening by the metal electrons can have large influence on the qp energies of the adsorbed molecule@xcite  an effect completely missed by both local and hybrid density functionals@xcite .",
    "this has recently motivated the use of semi - empirical schemes for correcting the dft eigenvalues by a scissors operator prior to transport calculations@xcite .",
    "while such schemes can be justified for weakly coupled molecules , they become uncontrolled in the relevant regime of covalently bonded molecules where the screening effects mix with charge transfer and hybridization@xcite .    in this work",
    "we combine nonequilibrium green function methods for electron transport with the fully selfconsistent gw approximation for exchange and correlation to establish a theoretical benchmark for the electronic structure and conductance of gold/1,4-benzenedithiolate ( bdt ) , -benzenedithiol ( bdt+h ) and -benzenediamine ( bda ) molecular junctions .",
    "we find a conductance of @xmath3 for bda and @xmath4 for bdt+h in very good agreement with experimental data . in comparison ,",
    "the conductance obtained from dft is about five times higher while non - selfconsistent g@xmath0w@xmath0 calculations produce conductances within 50% of the selfconsistent gw result .",
    "we argue that the bdt+h structure can be viewed as a simple model of recently proposed rs - au(i)-sr gold / thiolate structures involing two molecules attached to the same au adatom .",
    "the conductance of a simple bdt molecule between au(111 ) surfaces is predicted to be on the order of @xmath5 by both dft , hartree - fock and gw . the origin of the high conductance is due to an unsaturated sulfur @xmath6 orbital with energy just below the fermi energy . in the bdt+h and rs - au(i)-sr structures ,",
    "the sulfurs are fully passivated and the @xmath6-orbital moves away from @xmath7 leading to an effective decoupling of the c@xmath8h@xmath9 moiety from the gold electrodes .",
    "we find that the main effect of the gw self - energy is to shift the molecular levels and can be modelled by a simple scissors operator .",
    "however , the energy dependence of the gw self - energy may also affect the shape of the transmission resonances and this can change the conductance by almost a factor of two .",
    "most implementations of the gw method invoke one or several technical approximations like the plasmon pole approximation , neglect of off - diagonal matrix elements in the gw self - energy , analytic continuations from the imaginary to the real frequency axis , neglect of core states contributions to the self - energy , neglect of self - consistency .",
    "the range of validity of these approximations has been explored for solid state systems by a number of authors@xcite , however , much less is known about their applicability to molecular and metal - molecule systems .",
    "for this reason our implementation of the gw method avoids all of these approximations and as such represents an exact treatment of the gw self - energy within the space of the employed atomic orbital basis set .",
    "although we compare our results to experimental data and discuss them in relation to the possible atomic structure of the junctions , we stress that the main purpose of this study is the benchmarking of quantum transport calculations for specific , idealized junction with particular focus on the role of electronic correlation effects .",
    "we consider a quantum conductor consisting of a molecule connected to left ( l ) and right ( r ) electrodes .",
    "we shall assume that outside a certain region containing the molecule and part of the electrodes ( the `` extended molecule '' ) , the electron - electron interactions can be described by a mean field potential .",

    "this formula was originally derived for non - interacting electrons , but is in fact valid for interacting electrons in the low - bias limit@xcite .",
    "we have verified that this is indeed fulfilled to high numerical accuracy in our gw calculations by comparing the conductance obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq.eq0 ] ) for small finite voltages with @xmath16 evaluated in equilibrium .",

    "the electrode self - energies @xmath20 are obtained from the kohn - sham hamiltonian of a bulk dft calculation using standard techniques@xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions in the plane normal to the transport direction enter only via the electrode self - energies which are constructed from the electrode surface green function@xcite .",
    "the latter should represent an infinite surface but is here approximated by that of a periodic supercell with @xmath21 au atoms in the surface plane .",
    "we have found that this is a very good approximation when the surface green function of the @xmath21 cell is evaluated at a general @xmath22-point ( we use @xmath23 in coordinates of the surface brillouin zone basis vectors ) . using high symmetry points , in particular the gamma point ,",

    "the irreducible density reponse function is computed in the time domain , @xmath38 where the factor 2 accounts for spin .",

    "( color online ) schematic of a molecular junction with the `` molecule '' and `` extended molecule '' regions indicated ( small and large box , respectively ) .",
    "the gw self - energy ( @xmath40 ) is calculated on the molecule while the polarization ( @xmath41 ) and screened interaction ( @xmath34 ) are evaluated for the extended region to ensure proper treatment of non - local screening effects .",
    "the electrodes and electrode - molecule coupling is described at the dft level .",
    "a second order feynman diagram is shown . ]    as explained above , the matrices @xmath41 , @xmath34 , and @xmath42 are calculated for the extended molecule .",
    "on the other hand it is clear that @xmath34 , and thus @xmath42 , should have contributions from polarization diagrams outside this region , see fig .",
    "physically these diagrams describe the potential acting on an electron propagating on the molecule due to the polarization that it induces in the lead . for this reason",
    "the self - energy will not be fully converged at the ends of the extended molecule region . to overcome this problem we only use the part of @xmath42 corresponding to the molecule and replace the remaining parts of the xc self - energy of the extended molecule by the dft xc - potential .",
    "symbolically , @xmath43 we stress that although we only include @xmath42 on the molecule , the interactions between electrons on the molecule and electrons in the electrodes ( leading e.g. to image charge renormalization of the molecular levels ) are included via diagrams of the form shown in fig .",
    "we also note that the form ( [ eq.sigma2 ] ) implies that all metal atoms , both those inside and outside the extended molecule , are consistently described at the same ( dft ) level . for the size of the extended molecule",
    "we have found it sufficient to include the gold atoms which are nearest neighbors to the sulfur or nitrogen atoms , i.e two gold atoms for the tip structures and six for the flat structure depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , see appendix [ app3 ] .",
    "we expect that this rather local screening response is special for covalent metal - molecule bonds .      the time / frequency dependence of @xmath11 , @xmath41 , @xmath34 , and @xmath42 is represented on a uniform grid ranging from @xmath44 to @xmath45 ev with a grid spacing of @xmath46ev .",
    "we have verified that the results are coverged with respect to both the size and spacing of this grid .",
    "fast fourier transform is used to switch between energy and time domains to avoid convolutions .",
    "the calculations are parallelized both over basis functions and over the time / frequency grid points .",
    "one should always have @xmath47 to ensure proper representation of possible bound states .",
    "however , we have found that the conductance , and more generally the transmission function at any given energy , can be linearly extrapolated to the @xmath48 limit .",
    "this extrapolation has been performed for all the results presented in this work .",
    "the memory requirements for the gw calculations ( defined mainly by the size of the @xmath41 and @xmath34 matrices ) are approximately a factor 50 larger than for a corresponding dft calculation .",
    "the gw calculations for the benzene junctions considered in the present work were performed in parallel on 100 - 400 cores and took about 2 hours per selfconsisistency iteration . in comparison a dft calculation for the same system took around 5 hours on 8 cores .",
    "the calculation of all of the coulomb matrix elements , @xmath49 , is prohibitively costly for larger basis sets .",
    "fortunately the matrix is to a large degree dominated by negligible elements . to systematically define the most significant coulomb elements",
    ", we use the product basis technique of aryasetiawan and gunnarsson @xcite . in this approach , the pair orbital overlap matrix @xmath50 where @xmath51 is used to screen for the significant elements of @xmath52 .",
    "the eigenvectors of the overlap matrix eq . represents a set of `` optimized pair orbitals '' and the eigenvalues their norm .",
    "optimized pair orbitals with insignificant norm must also yield a reduced contribution to the coulomb matrix , and are omitted in the calculation of @xmath52 .",
    "we have found that the basis for @xmath52 can be limited to optimized pair orbitals with a norm larger than @xmath53 without sacrificing accuracy .",
    "this gives a significant reduction in the number of coulomb elements that needs to be evaluated , and it reduces the matrix size of @xmath54 and @xmath55 correspondingly , see appendix [ sec : gwselfenergy ] .",
    "since both core and all - electron valence states are available in the paw method , we can evaluate the contribution to the valence exchange self - energy coming from the core electrons .",
    "as the density matrix is simply the identity matrix in the subspace of atomic core states , this valence - core exchange reads @xmath56 where @xmath57 represent valence basis functions and @xmath58 represent atomic core states .",
    "this contribution is added to @xmath42 describing the valence - valence interactions .",
    "we limit the inclusion of valence - core interactions to the exchange potential , neglecting it in the correlation .",
    "this is reasonable , because the polarization bubble , @xmath41 , involving core and valence states will be small due to the large energy difference and small spatial overlap of the valence and core states .",
    "in general we have found that the effect of @xmath59 on molecular energy levels can be up to 1 ev@xcite .",
    "for the benzene - like molecules considered in this work the effect is generally less than 0.4 ev for the frontier orbitals .      since @xmath42 and @xmath60 depend on @xmath11 , the dyson equation ( [ eq.gr ] )",
    "must be solved self - consistently in conjunction with the self - energies . in practice , this self - consistency problem is solved by iteration .",
    "we have found that a linear mixing of the green functions , @xmath61 with @xmath62 generally leads to selfconsistency within 20 - 30 iterations .",
    "fully selfconsistent gw calculations are not standard , and in fact only few previous calculations of this type have been reported@xcite .",
    "conventional gw bandstructure calculations typically apply a one - shot technique where the self - energy is evaluated with a non - interacting green function , @xmath32 , usually obtained from dft@xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the selfconsistent approach has the immediate advantage of removing the @xmath32-dependence , i.e. it leads to a unique solution .    for an approach , like the present , where the chemical potential is fixed by the external boundary conditions , some kind of selfconsistency ( though not necessarily the full gw selfconsistency employed here ) is essential to ensure charge neutrality",
    "this is particularly important for cases where a molecular resonance lies close to the chemical potential .",
    "a shift in the energy of such a resonance could lead to a large change in its occupation . in a selfconsistent calculation",
    "this shift would be counterbalanced , mainly by a change in the hartree potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the one - shot approach does not account for this effect and unphysical level alignments could occur as a result",
    ".    finally , the fully selfconsistent gw approximation is a conserving approximation in the sense of baym@xcite .",
    "this becomes particularly important in the context of transport where it ensures that the continuity equation is satisfied@xcite .",
    "we mention that the recently introduced quasi - selfconsistent gw method ( not to be confused with the fully selfconsistent gw approximation used here ) , in which @xmath32 is chosen such as to mimick the interacting green function as closely as possible , have shown that selfconsistency in general improves the band gaps of semiconductors as compared to standard one - shot calculations.@xcite",
    "in this section we discuss the results of our selfconsistent gw calculations for the electronic structure and conductance of the prototypical gold/1,4-benzenedithiolate ( bdt ) , -benzenedithiol ( bdt+h ) , and -benzenediamine ( bda ) molecular junctions .",
    "we argue that the thiol structure can be considered as a simple model for more complex gold / thiolate structures which have been proposed recently@xcite but which are currently too large to be treated satisfactorily at the gw level .",
    "the transport results are rationalized by considering the alignment of molecular energy levels in the junction . here",
    "we show that both dft and hartree - fock provide quantitatively and qualitatively wrong results by predicting a gap opening rather than reduction when the molecule is attached to electrodes .",
    "finally , we investigate to what extent the gw results can be reproduced by a simple scissors operator applied to the dft hamiltonian .",
    "the junction geometries were optimized using the real space projector augmented wave method gpaw@xcite .",
    "we used a grid spacing of 0.2    and the pbe functional for exchange and correlation@xcite .",
    "the molecules were attached to au(111 ) surfaces , modelled by a seven layer thick @xmath21 slab , either directly ( in the case of bdt ) or via tips ( in the case of bdt+h and bda ) as shown in fig .",
    "the surface brillouin zone was sampled on a @xmath21 @xmath63-point grid , and the structures including molecule , au tips , and outermost au surface layers were relaxed until the residual force was below 0.05 ev /  .",
    "the three structures are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and some key bond lengths are given here@xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that the hydrogen atoms dissociate from the thiol end groups forming a gold - thiolate structure@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our total energy calculations show that the benzenedithiol structure has a slightly lower energy than the benzenedithiolate when inserted between two gold tips as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](middle ) . in these calculations",
    "the hydrogens were either taken to be in the gas - phase or are adsorbed on the au tips . in both cases the energy gain is less than 0.1 ev at the equilibrium distance but increases to 0.3 ev for a junction stretched by 1   .",
    "we stress that our calculations do not include effects of entropy which becomes relevant at finite temperature , and furthermore assumes that hydrogen in the gas phase is the proper reference for the solvated proton and an electron in the electrode , i.e. the reaction @xmath64+@xmath65 is in equilibrium ( in electrochemistry language we assume the standard hydrogen potential at ph=0 ) . for these reasons our calculations are not sufficient to address the relative stability of thiols vs. thiolates under the relevant experimental conditions .",
    "importantly we note that new experimental evidence for the chemical structure of the gold - thiolate interface at the au(111 ) surface@xcite or at au nanocluster surfaces@xcite has recently emerged , pointing to the existence of polymeric sr - au(i)-sr units where the formally oxidised au(i ) adatoms are chemically bound to thiolates and form a part of a more complex structure ( see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "these complexes are currently too challenging to treat satisfactorily at the gw level .",
    "however , we have found that the electronic structure of such complexes is quite similar to that of the dithiol structure , see sec .",
    "[ sec.thiol ] .",
    "this is because the hydrogen atoms play a role similar to that of the au adatom in passivating the sulfur atoms .",
    "therefore the transport properties of the dithiol structure should also be similar to those of the sr - au(i)-sr units .",
    "a natural requirement for a method intended to describe the energy levels of molecules in contact with electrodes , is that it should be able to describe the energy levels of isolated molecules .",
    "as we show below , the dft approach fails completely in this respect underestimating the homo - lumo gaps of the three molecules by 5 - 6 ev while gw energies lie within 0.5 ev of the target values .",
    "the gas - phase molecular structures have been relaxed in a 16    cubic cell using gpaw grid calculations as described in the previous section . for consistency ,",
    "all energy levels have been calculated using the same double - zeta ( dz ) atomic orbitals basis set .",
    "this is the same basis as used for the molecules in the transport calculations presented in the next section . for the dft and hartree - fock calculations we have found that the energies obtained with the dz basis agree with accurate grid calculations to within 0.2 ev . for the gw calculations the energies are within 0.1 ev of those obtained with a dz+polarization basis set .",
    "table [ table.gas_levels ] summarizes the results for the homo and lumo orbital energies obtained from the dft - pbe eigenvalues , selfconsistent hartree - fock , and selfconsistent gw .",
    "the energy levels have been identified as the peaks in the spectral function @xmath66 $ ] extrapolated to @xmath48 . due to lack of accurate experimental data we have also performed dft - pbe total energy calculations for the neutral , cation , and anion species to obtain the addition / removal energies ( last column ) .",
    "this approach has been shown to produce very accurate estimates of the experimental ionization and affinity levels of small molecules@xcite .",
    "relative to this reference , the dft eigenvalues underestimate the homo - lumo gap of all three molecules by @xmath67  ev , hartree - fock overestimates it by @xmath68  ev , while the gap obtained with gw lies within @xmath69  ev .",
    "these trends are consistent with a recent study of ionization potentials of a large number of molecules@xcite .",
    "the main reason for the large underestimation of the gap by dft is the presence of self - interactions in the pbe functional.@xcite on the other hand hartree - fock is self - interaction free ; here , by virtue of koopmans theorem , the overstimation of the gap can be seen as a result of neglect of orbital relaxations .",
    "the effect of the latter is included in gw via the screened interaction and this reduces the gap relative the unscreened hartree - fock result .",
    "we furthermore note that dft places the lumo of bda and bdt+h below the vacuum level thus incorrectly predicting the anions to be stable . for bdt , the lumo level is predicted to be negative by all methods indicating the radical nature of this species .",

    "when a molecule is brought from the gas - phase into a junction the electronic character of its environment changes from insulating to metallic .",
    "the enhanced screening should thus cause the gap to shrink ( neglecting shifts due to hybridization ) as compared to its gas - phase value .",
    "however , it has recently been shown for molecules weakly bonded to a metal surface , that this effect is completely missing in effective single - particle theories based on a ( semi)local description of correlations @xcite .    as a result , in our dft and hartree - fock calculations",
    ", the change in the frontier orbital energies induced by the coupling to gold is completely governed by the effect of hybridization which tends to open the gap by @xmath92  ev for both molecules , see top panel of fig .",
    "in contrast , the gw gap is reduced by @xmath93  ev due to the enhanced screening in the contact .",
    "since the hybridization shift is of course also present in he gw calculation , we conclude that the enhanced screening due to the metal contacts reduces the homo - lumo gap by @xmath94  ev relative to the value in the gas - phase .",
    "note that we refrain from using the term `` image charge effect '' to describe the renormalization of molecular orbitals .",
    "this term is appropriate for weakly coupled molecules where the screening of the added electron / hole takes place within the metal . for intermediate or strongly coupled molecules",
    ", there is no clear distinction between metal states and molecular states , and the screening is more appropriately described as dynamical charge transfer@xcite .    from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it follows that the homo level of the molecules in the junction is predicted by dft - pbe to lie @xmath95  ev higher than obtained with gw .",
    "this agrees well with a recent study of benzenediamine derivatives on gold(111 ) which showed that dft places the homo level about 1 ev too high compared to ups measurements@xcite .",
    "the fact that the dft - pbe description of the energy levels is better for the adsorbed rather than isolated molecules may be seen as a result of the metallic screening build into the dft xc - functional via its origin in the homogeneous electron gas@xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the error ( compared to gw ) of the dft eigenvalues is significantly larger for the lumo than for the homo .",
    "this is in good agreement with previous plane wave calculations for molecule / metal interfaces@xcite .      to test the role of selfconsistency ( in the gw and hartree self - energies ) we have performed non - selfconsistent g@xmath0w@xmath0 calculations using both the dft - pbe green function and the ( selfconsistent ) hartree - fock green function as the initial @xmath32 .",
    "the results for the conductance of all systems are summarized in the last two rows of table [ table.conductance ] .",
    "we notice is that the conductance can vary by a factor of three depending on @xmath32 .",
    "we also note that the hartree - fock starting point comes closer to the selfconsistent result .",
    "this is because the hartree - fock green function is an overall better approximation to the gw green function than is the dft green function ( see e.g. the comparison of frontier orbital energies in fig .",

    "this can be understood as follows : since dft - pbe ( hartree - fock ) underestimates ( overestimates ) the homo - lumo gap , the use of these green functions to evaluate the gw self - energy will lead to an overestimation ( underestimation ) of the screening . as discussed above",
    "the screening contained in the correlation part of the gw self - energy tend to reduce the homo - lumo gap .",
    "this reduction of the gap is thus overestimated in the g@xmath0w@xmath0[pbe ] calculation and underestimated in the g@xmath0w@xmath0[hf ] calculation which explains the trends in conductance , i.e. more screening @xmath96 smaller gap @xmath96 higher conductance .",

[ fig5 ] we show contour plots of the dft conductance for the bda junction where the shift of the occupied and unoccupied molecular orbital energies has been varied independently over 4 ev .",
    "the three values for the contour lines shown correspond to the conductance obtained with gw ( 0.0042g@xmath0 ) , the experimental conductance ( 0.0064g@xmath0 ) and the dft conductance ( 0.021g@xmath0 ) , respectively .",
    "the dot indicates the energy shifts which make the homo and lumo levels of the dft calculation match the corresponding levels of the gw calculation ; the required so shifts are -0.6ev and 3.8ev for the occupied and unoccupied molecular orbitals , respectively .",
    "shifting the levels by this amount reduces the dft conductance by a factor of  3 from 0.02g@xmath0 to 0.0072g@xmath0 .",
    "interestingly , the gw conductance is not reproduced by these shifts ; it is even lower by a factor of  1.5 .",
    "in fact , to reproduce the gw conductance a shift of about -1.3ev of the dft homo is required ( keeping the lumo position fixed at the gw position ) .",
    "this shows that while the renormalization of the molecular level energies can explain the main part of the difference between the dft and gw conductance , the different shape of the transmission resonances also plays a role .",
    "this is clear from the inset which shows the gw transmission function ( green ) and the dft transmission with so chosen to match the gw homo and lumo levels ( the dot in the main figure ) .",

    "the transmission function is then essentially the product of the pdos of the homo-1 and the pdos of the group orbital@xcite .",
    "it is clear that the origin of the ( double ) transmission peak around -1 ev for structure ( a ) is due to a resonance formed by the homo-1 and the sulfur @xmath6-orbital .",
    "the chemical passivation of sulfur , by either hydrogen or the au adatom , implies that the pdos of the @xmath6-orbital splits into bonding and anti - bonding states around -3 ev and 3 ev , respectively .",
    "this in turn shifts the pdos of the homo-1 down in energy .",
    "in particular its magnitude around the fermi level is lowered and as a consequence the transmission function ( being essentially the product of the two curves ) is suppressed in a broad energy window around @xmath7 .",

    "is very similar to that of ( c ) and the conductance is @xmath99 compared to @xmath100 obtained for structure ( c ) . on the other hand , the conductance of bdt can not be brought below @xmath101 by sifting the levels of the c@xmath8h@xmath9 moiety down ( by up to 2 ev ) because of the strong peak around -1 ev due to the sulphur @xmath6-orbital .    although the above picture is based on the dft electronic structure , the qualitative similarities of the dft and gw transmission functions in fig .",

    "the latter methods respectively overestimates and underestimates the screening and none of them are able to detect the change in the molecule s electronic environment when it is coupled to electrodes .    non - selfconsistent g@xmath0w@xmath0 calculations were found to yield conductance values within 50% of the gw results depending on the initial g@xmath0 .",
    "it was shown that the main difference between the gw and dft calculations comes from the renormalization of the position of the molecular energy levels .",
    "however , changes in the shape of transmission resonances , and thus the conductance , also occur due to the energy - dependence of the gw self - energy .",
    "the gw conductance of benzenediamine was found to be in good agreement with experiments .",
    "for benzenedithiolate between au(111 ) surfaces we found a conductance well above @xmath101 and thus conclude that this structure can not be responsible for the measured conductance around 0.01@xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "a conductance close to this value was found for a hydrogenated benzenedithiol junction which , as we demonstrated , represents a reasonable model of more complex gold / thiolate structures where the chemical passivation of sulfur is provided by a gold adatom rather than hydrogen .",
