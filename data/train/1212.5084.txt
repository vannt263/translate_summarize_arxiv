    "the present conference took place at a period which marks a significant milestone in the development of stellar physics : asteroseismology , which aims to infer the structural properties of stars which display multi - mode pulsations , has entered in a new golden age .",
    "in fact , ground - based observations have reached such level of accuracy to allow investigation of several type of oscillating stars ; the satellite most ( walker et al . 2003 ) , the first space mission totally dedicated to the observation of stellar oscillations , has been successfully launched in june 2003 and has just started to reveal primary results on the analysis of pulsations seen outside earth s atmosphere . in order to make full use of these observational successes , several theoretical techniques have been developed or adopted from helioseismology to probe the internal characteristics of stars other than the sun .    here",
    "i will review on the theoretical aspects of asteroseismology , considering methods and tools available today to manipulate observed frequencies of oscillation in order to investigate the evolutionary and structural properties of the stars .",
    "example of application to real data set will be given for each asteroseismic diagnostic tool considered .",
    "some recent results will be shown and comments will be given on perspectives for the future .",
    "for basic concepts on the theory of stellar oscillations i refer to classical books ( e.g. cox 1980 ; unno et al .",
    "1989 ) ; for theoretical methods and developments in asteroseismology see reviews by , e.g. , christensen - dalsgaard ( 2003 , 2004 ) , christensen - dalsgaard and dziembowski ( 2000 ) , dziembowski ( 2003b ) , gough ( 2003 ) , patern , di mauro and ventura ( 2003 ) , roxburgh ( 2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "during the last decades , numerous observational and theoretical efforts in the study of the acoustic modes of solar oscillations , has brought to a detailed knowledge of the interior of the sun .",
    "the experience acquired in helioseismology on handling pulsations frequency data provides a good starting point for asteroseismic investigations .",
    "however , inferences of the interior of stars other than the sun appear to be much more complicated and less outstanding in terms of achievable results . the large stellar distances , the point - source character of the stars , the low amplitude of the oscillations and the effect of the earth s atmosphere on the signal , restrict the asteroseismic studies to the use of small sets of data often characterized by modes with only low harmonic degrees ( @xmath0 ) . however , the main difference between helio- and asteroseismology is that global parameters of the sun , are much better known than they are for any other star .",
    "luminosity , effective temperature , surface composition and @xmath1 are obtained , within a certain error , from spectrum analysis of distant stars ; age and composition are estimated approximately only for stars in clusters ; masses and radii are measured only for spectroscopic binaries .",
    "in addition , all these measurements can be affected by unknown effects such as loss , accretion , or diffusion of mass .",
    "thus , the structure of the model of the stars can not be so well constrained such as that of the sun .",
    "all these problems make asteroseismic inferences quite difficult , so that the successes reached by helioseismic studies are beyond the possibility of asteroseismology .",
    "nevertheless , several attempts have been made , during the last years , with the aim to identify oscillations in distant stars and also to model the stellar pulsational phenomena .",
    "in fact , oscillations have several advantages over all the other observables : pulsational instability has been detected in stars in all the evolutionary stages and of different spectral type ; frequencies of oscillations can be measured with high accuracy and depend in very simply way on the equilibrium structure of the model ( only on two independent variables , e.g. the local adiabatic speed of sound and density ) ; different modes are confined and probe different layers of the interior of the stars .",
    "thus , accurate observations of the acoustic frequencies , can be used not only to study the physics of the stellar interior , but also to constrain theories of stellar evolution .",
    "the historical pulsating stars , like the classical cepheids , w - virginis and rr - lyrae , characterized by a large luminosity variations , show only one or two pulsation modes , limiting the knowledge of the structural properties to the mean density or in better cases to the mass and radius .",
    "asteroseismology is understood as the study of pulsations on stars in which many oscillation modes are excited at once .",
    "this definition is broad enough to include many types of pulsating stars .",
    "multi - mode oscillations have been detected in stars which are spread over a significant part of the hr - diagram , reflecting different evolutionary stages from main - sequence to the white dwarf cooling sequence .",
    "luminosity and effective temperature of the major classes of pulsating stars are shown in the hr - diagram of fig .",
    "[ hrall ] .",
    "we can divide the stars on which it is possible to apply seismic techniques into two groups .",
    "a group of stars show oscillations with intensity amplitude in the range of millimagnitudes and includes white dwarf , @xmath2 scuti stars , the rapidly rotating ap stars , the @xmath3-cephei stars , the slowly pulsating b ( spb ) stars and the @xmath4 doradus stars .",
    "stars of these classes show modes excited by @xmath5-mechanism due to a perturbation of the opacity , caused by structural conditions typical of each considered class .",
    "the second group includes the stars with tiny oscillations amplitude ( around @xmath6magnitudes or less ) and includes the so - called solar - like stars , in which , like the sun , oscillations are excited by turbulent convection in the outer convective envelope .    for the purposes of this review , however , i will concentrate manly on solar - type stars and i will give just a summary on some theoretical results obtained by asteroseismology on some other pulsating targets at the end of this review .",
    "the principal reason for doing so is due to the excitement of the community for the recent observational successes obtained on some solar - type stars ( e.g. , @xmath7-can min and @xmath7-cen ) which have given the possibility , for the first time , of handling large sets of accurate oscillation frequencies to investigate the internal structure of the stars .",
    "moreover , it should be pointed out , that methods and techniques developed and adapted for solar - type stars , are also valid for the other pulsating stars .",
    "a detailed and updated description of the characteristics of the main asteroseismic targets can be found in recent reviews ( e.g. dziembowski 2003b ; kurtz 2004 ; patern , di mauro and ventura 2003 ) .",
    "many of the oscillation modes which can be detected in stars are limited to only the lowest degree ones , owing to the point - like character of these sources . if the condition that @xmath8 is satisfied , the excited p - modes can be described in terms of the asymptotic theory ( tassoul 1980 ) , which predicts that oscillation frequencies @xmath9 of acoustic modes , characterized by radial order @xmath10 , at harmonic degree @xmath11 should satisfy the following approximation : @xmath12 where @xmath7 is a function of the frequency determined by the properties of the surface layers , @xmath13 is a small correction which depends on the conditions in the stellar core .",
    "@xmath14 is the inverse of the sound travel time across the stellar diameter : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the local speed of sound at radius @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the photospheric stellar radius .",
    "the property expressed by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) may provide almost immediate asteroseismic inferences on stellar parameters and constraints on theoretical models for a variety of solar - like stars in a wide range of evolutionary stages . for a given @xmath11 , the acoustic spectra show a series of equally spaced peaks between p modes of same degree and adjacent @xmath10",
    ", whose frequency separation represents the so called large separation which is approximately equivalent to @xmath14 : @xmath19 the spectra are characterized by another series of peaks , whose narrow separation is @xmath20 , known as small separation : @xmath21 where @xmath22 \\ , .\\ ] ] instead of the small separations one could consider the so - called second differences of frequencies : @xmath23    @xmath24 , and hence the general spectrum of acoustic modes , scales approximately as the square root of the mean density , that is , for fixed mass , as @xmath25 . on the other hand , the small frequency separation and the second difference , are both sensitive to the chemical composition gradient in central regions of the star and hence to its evolutionary state .",
    "thus , the determination of both large and small frequency separation , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , provides measures of the mass and the age of the star ( e.g.  christensen - dalsgaard 1988 ) .",
    "see review by gough ( 2003 ) on the potential of frequencies separations as asteroseismic diagnostic .",
    "analogous properties have been derived for the g - modes .",
    "tassoul s theory shows that in the asymptotic regime the g - modes are nearly uniformly spaced in period .",
    "g - modes will be discussed in more details in sec .",
    "[ s.wd ] , since the only types of stars in which these are commonly observed are rather special cases .      seismic analysis of observed acoustic frequencies is an extremely powerful tool for the investigation of the internal structure of the stars , but the use of large and small separations can be misleading if not accurately considered .",
    "theoretical pulsation frequencies , essential for asteroseismic investigation , are calculated on theoretical models of stars which are inevitably affected by errors . in particular , the structure of the near - surface regions of stars is quite uncertain : there are still substantial ambiguity in modelling the convective flux , considering the sources and the mechanisms of excitation and damping of the oscillations , defining an appropriate equation of state to describe the thermodynamic properties of the stellar structure , as well as in the treatment of non - adiabatic effects . limiting the investigation to the use of small separations do not solve the problem .",
    "in fact , the small separation which is determined principally by condition in the core , also retains some sensitivity to the mean density and to the detailed properties of the stellar envelope .    to solve these problems the use of a new seismic indicator was introduced by roxburgh and vorontsov ( 2003a ) , which compared pulsating properties of several models with exactly the same interior structure , but different outer envelopes , obtained by keeping constant the first adiabatic exponent all along the radius or by introducing linear variation of the polytropic index in the structure of the envelope .",
    "they showed that the ratios of small to large separations , @xmath28 are independent of the structure of the outer layers and hence can be used as diagnostic of the interior of stars .",
    "solar - type stars are f , g and possibly k main - sequence and sub - giants stars in which oscillations are excited stochastically by vigorous near - surface convection in a broad spectrum of low amplitude p - modes , as in the sun .",
    "there is also good evidence , both from photometry with the wire satellite ( buzasi et al .",
    "2000 ) and ground - based velocity studies , for solar - like oscillations in g , k and semi - regular m giants .",
    "the oscillation periods are expected to be in the range from the typical 5-min ( main - sequence stars ) , as in the sun , up to about a few days ( sub - giant and giant stars ) .",
    "[ hrsolartype ] shows location in hr - diagram of the solar - type pulsating stars and of some selected targets .",
    "one of the greatest deficiencies in modelling oscillations in stars with surface convection zones is the lack of a proper theory to describe convection and its interaction with pulsations .",
    "several attempts have been made in recent years to address this problem .",
    "christensen - dalsgaard and frandsen ( 1983 ) made the first effort to give a rough prediction of amplitudes of solar - like oscillations .",
    "they found velocity and luminosity amplitudes increasing with age and with mass along the main sequence .",
    "simple scaling laws to estimate the amplitudes in velocity have been proposed by , e.g. , kjeldsen and bedding ( 1995 , 2001 ) .",
    "impressive progress has been made on hydrodynamical simulations of convection , and its interaction with pulsations , leading houdek et al .",
    "( 1999 ) to give estimates of the pulsation properties , including the damping rates , of main - sequence stars by using models based on mixing - length treatment of convection .",
    "according to theoretical estimations ( e.g. houdek et al .",
    "1999 , kjeldsen and bedding 1995 ) the expected luminosity variations are of about a few mmag in giant stars while in main - sequence and sub - giant stars are so small ( from @xmath29 up to a few @xmath30 ) to be well below the detection limit for ground - based photometric observations .",
    "the radial velocity amplitudes are expected to be at most @xmath31 in k giants , @xmath32 in f and g sub - giants and even smaller in main - sequence solar - type stars .",
    "these amplitudes are at the edge of the photon noise limits of most of the available spectrographs .",
    "the theoretical prediction have been tested and compared with observational results , revealing a fairly good agreement for the several solar - like stars already detected",
    ". however , calculation of damping rates are still a problem .",
    "theoretical prediction have been able to reproduce observed lifetimes of oscillations only in the case of the sun .",
    "observations of stars which are somewhat more evolved than the sun , like procyon ( barban et al .",
    "1999 ) , @xmath7  cen a ( bedding et al . 2004 ) , @xmath3 hyi ( bedding et al . 2002 ) and @xmath33  hya ( stello et al . 2004 ) have shown mode lifetimes shorter than the values predicted by the theoretical models ( houdek et al .",
    "this inconsistency with observations seems to indicate that there is still some contributions to damping so far ignored in the theory .",
    "reliable calculation of stellar models is the basic prerequisite for all asteroseismic investigations of stellar internal properties .",
    "the structure models are produced by employing up - to - date physical information and the most updated input parameters ( composition , mass , mixing - length ) in order to reproduce all the spectroscopic and photometric observations of the considered stars .",
    "evolutionary sequences are calculated by including additional effects such as overshoot from the convective core ( e.g. di mauro et al . 2003 ) during the main - sequence phase , diffusion and settling of helium and heavy elements ( e.g. vauclaire 2003 ) .    in the case of solar - type stars ,",
    "detailed classical models have been produced on several well observed targets : @xmath7 cen ( e.g. guenther and demarque 2000 ; morel et al . 2000 , thvenin et al .",

    ", modelling of distant stars involves physical effects which substantially complicates the calculation .",
    "one of the most crucial problem in computing stellar structure is related to the modelling of the convective transport of energy in the interior and the associated physical effects such as the evolution of the composition in presence of convective regions ( e.g. dupret , these proceedings ) .",
    "see the reviews by demarque and robinson ( 2003 ) and dantona , montalban and mazzitelli ( 2004 ) about sophisticated models of convection .",
    "another trouble is represented by the fact that effects of rotation in stellar modelling are often neglected .",
    "the rotation may affect oscillation frequencies forming rather complex power spectra . in order to identify and reproduce the observed modes it is necessary to develop an appropriate treatment of rotation in the evolutionary models and in the calculation of oscillation frequencies . to date ,",
    "rotational effects have been taken into account mainly using perturbation theory approaches .",
    "the coriolis and the centrifugal forces , which in the case of moderate and fast - rotators can not be neglected , have been taken into proper account as first- , second- and even third order perturbations .",
    "many authors ( saio 1981 ; gough and thompson 1990 ; dziembowski and goode 1992 ; soufi , goupil and dziembowski 1998 ; karami , christensen - dalsgaard and pijpers 2003 ) have approached the problem under various approximations , also including radial and latitudinal dependence of rotation and magnetic fields , which remove the degeneracy of the modes .",
    "however perturbation theory might be inadequate for the most rapidly rotating stars .",
    "calculation of the evolution and pulsations of two- or three - dimensional models , represents a solution for all these problems and turns out to be strongly recommended , but at present , very difficult to be attained ( e.g. demarque and robinson 2003 ) .",

    "courtesy of j. christensen - dalsgaard . ]    [ f.2 ]      one of the most recent strategy introduced in order to find the models which better reproduce the observations is represented by an optimization procedure known as model fitting method .",
    "given a set of input parameters , such as mass , mixing - length parameter and composition of a star , the method consists in searching , among all the possible models , the one which best fits all the known observables .",
    "this can be obtained by performing a @xmath38 minimization , looking for the parameters which minimizes : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are all the observables - luminosity , effective temperature , radius , oscillation frequencies , large and small separations , ratio of small to large separation - and @xmath41 are the theoretical values calculated on the models .",

    "extensive explanation of the method can be found in guenther and brown ( 2004 ) and roxburgh ( 2004 ) .",

    "models shown here have been obtained for several heavy - element abundances , and assuming mixing length parameter calibrated on a solar model that uses the same opacities , and an initial hydrogen mass fraction @xmath43    as in the case of @xmath34 boo , it appears difficult to constrain the evolution state of this star by considering only model results .",
    "the location of the star in the hr diagram identifies procyon a as being in the late - main - sequence phase of core hydrogen burning if the mass is taken in the range @xmath44 .",
    "however , it is also possible that procyon  a is still in the core hydrogen - burning main - sequence phase , if models are computed by assuming a mass higher by about @xmath45 , as shown by the evolution tracks plotted in fig .",
    "+ the problem of identifying the evolutionary state of this star can be approached by studying the pulsational characteristics of the computed models .",
    "the relevant parameters are given in table  [ t.4 ] for two models of procyon a selected for the pulsation analysis , which have surface radius , large and small theoretical separations consistent with the observed values .",
    "the pulsational features are clearly illustrated by looking at the echelle diagrams for the two different models ( fig .",
    "[ f.8 ] ) .",
    "it is evident that both the two considered models show a very good agreement with the observed frequencies .",
    "the only difference which can be noticed between the two models is that for the model in the late - main - sequence phase ( model  4 ) , the nonradial modes with @xmath46 show considerably more scatter than the radial ones .",
    "this aspect is associated with the avoided crossings which introduce a less regular structure in the frequency spectrum . on the contrary ,",
    "the modes of the models in the main - sequence phase ( model  3 ) show no occurrence of avoided crossing .",
    "[ f.10 ]    fig .",
    "[ f.8 ] shows that the observed frequencies for @xmath46 do not seem to indicate the presence of some irregularities similar to those seen for the computed frequencies of the more evolved model .",
    "if this were to be confirmed by more accurate sets of observed data , procyon a would be a star definitely identified as in the main - sequence phase .",
    "on considering the large amount of data available , in order to obtain additional information on the internal characteristics of procyon a , it has been thought to apply inversion techniques to the observed frequencies of this star ( martic et al .",
    "the results shown here have been obtained by applying a linear inversion procedure . if it is assumed that the equation of state of the star is known , the relative differences @xmath47 between the frequencies of procyon a and the model are related to the differences ( @xmath48 ) in squared isothermal sound speed @xmath49 and helium abundance @xmath50 in the convective zone , between the structure of the star and the reference model , through the following integral equation ( e.g. , dziembowski , pamyatnykh and sienkiewicz 1990 ) : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the kernels calculated for each mode @xmath54 of the set considered . equation  ( [ eqn : difg ] ) has been solved by applying the so called sola method ( pijpers and thompson 1992 , 1994 ) well used in helioseismology .",
    "[ f.10 ] shows the relative differences in @xmath55 between procyon a and the two selected models ( models 3 and 4 of table  [ t.4 ] ) as functions of the fractional radius .",
    "the results indicate that the difference between model 3 and procyon a are extremely small , below the @xmath45 , while model 4 shows very large deviations indicating that linerizations can not be applied to this model , whose properties are extremely different from those of the observed star .    from both the inversion results and analysis of the echelle diagrams , it can be concluded that present observations of oscillation frequencies of procyon a seem to indicate that this star is in main - sequence phase .",
    "it is worth to mention that provost et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) arrived exactly to the opposite conclusion by considerations on the recent measurements of radius by kervella et al .",
    "it is hoped that in the future more accurate observations will allow a detailed test of stellar modelling and evolution theories of procyon a , in order to identify its present evolutionary phase .",
    "another important property of the oscillation spectra is that sharp variations localized at certain acoustic depth in the structure of pulsating stars produce a distinctive quasi - periodic signal in the frequencies of oscillation .",
    "the characteristics of such signal are related to the location and thermodynamic properties of the layer where the sharp variation occurs .",
    "sources of sharp variations are the borders of convection zones and regions of rapid variation in the first adiabatic exponent @xmath56 , such as the one that occurs in the region of second ionization of helium .",
    "[ f.11 ] shows the variation of @xmath56 in the upper layers for a zams model of a star of @xmath57 and its relative periodic signal as seen in the large separation .",
    "a general expression ( valid for low degree modes ) for the signal generated is of the form ( e.g. monteiro , christensen - dalsgaard and thompson 1994 , 1998 , 2000 ; roxburgh and vorontsov 1994 ) : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is an amplitude as function of frequency @xmath60 , which depends on the properties of the sharp variation ; @xmath61 is a constant phase ; @xmath62 is the acoustic depth of the feature .",
    "several attempts have been tried in order to isolate the generated oscillatory components directly from the frequencies of oscillations or from linear combination of them ( large separations , second differences , etc ) .",
    "the common approach consists in removing a smooth component from the frequencies and to fit the residual signal to a theoretical expression , like that of eq .",
    "( [ sharp ] ) , which is related to the properties of the sharp feature",
    ".    this method can be applied , for example , to determine the properties of the base of the convective envelope ( monteiro , christensen - dalsgaard and thompson 2000 ; ballot , turck - chize and garca 2004 ) and in particular to put limits on the extension of the convective overshoot ( monteiro , christensen - dalsgaard and thompson 2002 ) , or to investigate the border of the convective core ( mazumdar and antia 2001 ; nghiem et al .",
    "but in particular , this peculiar property of the oscillation frequencies can be used to infer the helium abundance in the stellar envelope , by studying the variation of @xmath56 in the region of second ionization of helium .",
    "[ f.11 ]    several authors have tried to develop or refine their own fitting function to infer the helium abundance ( lopes et al .",

    "2004 and these proceedings ; houdek and gough in these proceedings ) .",
    "unfortunately this technique can not be applied to stars with mass larger than @xmath63 , owing to the contamination in the oscillatory signal coming from the first helium ionization zone .",
    "in fact , one of the main problem in the application of such an approach rises from the fact that signals coming from different sharp features in the interior of the star might overlap generating a complex behaviour , as it was noticed by mazumdar and antia ( 2001 ) .",
    "a similar effect was also considered by montgomery , metcalfe and winget ( 2003 ) in the case of g modes observed in white dwarfs .",
    "very recently miglio and antonello ( 2004 ) have shown that in the solar - type stars the problem of distinguishing between a signal generated near the core or near the surface in the star can be easily solved by considering modes of different degree or different seismic indicators .",
    "unfortunately this method can not successfully be applied in the case of the white dwarfs . at the moment , l. mantegazza et al .",
    "( private communication ) is working on a new technique based on the principal component analysis ( golyandina et al .",
    "2001 ; ghil et al .",
    "2002 ) in order to isolate all the different oscillatory components directly from the oscillation frequencies .",
    "it was already pointed out in miglio et al .",
    "( 2003 ) that a more general analysis of the effect of the bump in @xmath56 can be obtained by performing an inversion of the observed frequencies , by using the integral equation by gough and thompson ( 1991 ) . at the moment",
    "the method has been tested only in order to find differences between a reference equilibrium model and a fictitious model which differs from the reference one only because @xmath56 has been smoothed in the region of second helium ionization . in this case , the inversion of the artificial data set of modes with @xmath64 is able to reconstruct the variations in @xmath56 for models with masses from low up to @xmath65 , if the inverted set includes also few modes with low radial order ( @xmath66 ) , whose kernels seem to have considerable weight in the upper regions .",
    "the results obtained by applying seismic techniques to white dwarfs represent probably the biggest success of asteroseismology ( e.g. vauclair 1997 ; kawaler 1998 ; obrien 2003 ) .",
    "in fact , they represent the stars , other than the sun , in which the largest number of oscillation frequencies has been detected .",
    "the white - dwarf stars ( wds ) represent the most common end point of stellar evolution .",
    "their physical structure is very simple : a degenerate carbon - oxygen core and an extremely thin , mostly non - degenerate , surface layer of pure h or he .",
    "pulsations in wds represent a short - lived phase during their evolution : the majority of them do not show pulsations except in very narrow regions of instability located along their cooling track in hr - diagram : the planetary nebulae hot nuclei ( pnn ) , the hot do ( h deficient pre - white - dwarfs ) , the warm db ( wds with he rich photospheres ) and the cool da ( wds with h rich photospheres ) stages .",
    "wd variables are mainly multi - periodic pulsators in which high - order g - modes of low angular degree are excited , but the mechanism triggering the pulsations is still matter of discussion ( e.g. , cox 2002 ) .",
    "asteroseismology has been applied to identify the structural differences between different types of white dwarfs , and there is hope that it will permit in the future also the identification of the various origins . in fact , while theoretical models can be easily calculated without major efforts , it is still not possible to say which stellar structure might represent the precursor of each of the several types of white dwarfs .",
    "asymptotic theory , which gives a clear prediction of period spacing for these stars , has helped to determine the total mass , the rotation rate , the magnetic field strength and even the mass of the outer layers of some selected targets . in particular , since the rate of evolution of white dwarfs depends primarily on the thickness of their surface layers , it might be possible to measure the galactic age through the luminosity function ( e.g. wood and oswalt , 1998 ) .",
    "however , the most interesting characteristics studied by asteroseismology are the structure and composition of the c / o cores of white dwarfs and the evidence for crystallization of the cores in the most massive stars ( dav ) .",
    "as shown by montgomery and winget ( 1999 ) , crystallization leaves a typical signature on the period spectrum with an amplitude which increases as the fraction of crystallized matter increases .",
    "recently , two recent debates have been opened on the possibility to measure the fraction of crystallized matter ( see metcalfe , montgomery and kanaan 2004 ; brassard and fontaine these proceedings ) and the @xmath67 reaction rates in white dwarfs ( see metcalfe , salaris and winget 2002 ; fontaine and brassard , 2002 ) by studying their pulsational properties .",
    "some wd variables have , or are expected to have , spectra rich enough in modes to provide useful constraints on their rotational rates .",
    "attempts to derive the internal rotational profiles by using the observed splitting and adopting forward calculations and inversion techniques have been presented in several works ( e.g. kawaler , sekii and gough 1999 , vauclair et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "finally , another asteroseismic achievement is represented by the prediction that , during the pre - white - dwarf stage , the dominant energetic process is the neutrino cooling .",
    "since evolutionary changes affect the pulsation periods , the detection of secular period changes in the hottest wd pulsators allow to measure their cooling rates , providing experimental constraints on the theories of neutrino emission in dense plasmas and thermal neutrino production rates ( obrien and kawaler 2000 ) .",
    "@xmath2-scuti stars are typically population i , a and f main - sequence or slightly post main - sequence objects of about @xmath68 .",
    "they are located in the lower part of the classical cepheid instability strip where the @xmath5-mechanism is expected to drive low - order radial and non - radial p - modes , modes with a mixed p- and g - mode character , and possibly g - modes .",
    "most of the @xmath2-scuti stars are moderate or rapid rotators with surface velocities up to @xmath69 .",
    "the identification of the oscillation modes is a very complex task for these stars , since the asymptotic theory does not apply to the excited modes ( low - order p - modes ) .",
    "however , the main problem depends on the scarcity of observed modes , among the hundreds of excited pulsations predicted by theory .",
    "rapid rotation and possible differential rotation produce a rather complex power spectrum , making more difficult the identification of modes without additional information .",
    "+ thus , at the present , asteroseismology is able to put only some constraints on the internal structure of @xmath2 scuti stars .",
    "many interesting and comprehensive reviews on asteroseismology of @xmath2-scuti stars can be found in the recent literature ( e.g. , breger and montgomery 2000 ; goupil and talon 2002 ; paparo , these proceedings ) .",
    "the rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) variables , a subgroup of the chemically peculiar a - type stars , are h core - burning stars of mass @xmath70 2 m@xmath71 , characterized by strong dipole magnetic fields of the order of a few kg , which are the most intensive fields in main - sequence stars .",
    "their position in the h - r diagram overlaps the @xmath2-scuti star instability strip ( see fig .  1 ) , but",
    "the two groups of variables differ significantly in the behaviour of the excited modes .",
    "the roap stars pulsate in high - order ( @xmath72 ) , low - degree p - modes .",
    "most of the roap stars pulsate in almost pure dipole ( @xmath73 ) modes .",
    "the reason why stars with similar luminosity and effective temperature may show so different pulsation characteristics is not completely understood , even though it is clear that the strong magnetic fields could play an important role in selecting the excited modes .",
    "the parallax measurements have provided a primary opportunity to check independently the predictions of roap stars seismology .",
    "the results pointed out the tendency for seismic predicted values to be systematically slightly smaller than the hypparcos ones ( matthews et al .",
    "1999 ) .    the observed pulsation properties of roap stars were originally explained in terms of the so - called oblique pulsator model ( kurtz 1982 ) , in which pulsation and magnetic axes are mutually aligned , but tilted with respect to the rotation axis .",
    "the oblique pulsator model has been improved in order to better reproduce the observed power spectra of roap stars ( e.g. dziembowski and goode 1996 ) and more recently revisited by bigot and dziembowski ( 2002 ) which found out that the rotational effects seem to be so strong to result in a pulsation axis inclined with respect to both the rotation and the magnetic axes .",
    "however , the new theory still needs to be tested .",
    "the excitation mechanism for the roap stars is still an unresolved problem , although extensively debated over the years .",
    "the @xmath5-mechanism in the he ii ionization region which drives @xmath2-scuti star oscillations has been demonstrated to be inadequate for exciting high - frequency modes in roap stars , even though the two groups of variables share the same location in the h - r diagram .",
    "a great deal of alternative models were then proposed , each of them studying various effects which could affect the @xmath5-mechanism giving rise to mode instability , such as a reduced convective efficiency due to the action of the magnetic field ( balmforth et al 2001 ) , settling of he ( dolez and gough 1982 ) , presence of a stellar wind ( dolez , gough and vauclair 1988 ) or a chromosphere ( gautschy , saio , harzenmoser 1998 ) .",
    "asteroseismology constitutes a unique approach to the direct investigation of stellar structure and evolution which can significantly improve our knowledge of astrophysics , giving information on the structure , dynamics and evolutionary stage of the stars .",
    "asteroseismology is still far from the great results of helioseismology , but it is clear that its success will depend on the amount and quality of data collected by the ground - based observatories , the significant improvement in the accuracy expected from the future space missions , and the progresses in the development of the application to the stars of techniques for the data inversion and study of the effects of sharp features on the oscillation frequencies .",
