    "the unexpected coexistence of ferromagnetic and insulating behavior can not be explained by the double exchange mechanism and remains to be poor understood .",
    "a possible reason of the charge localization can be a long - range orbital ordering due to jahn - teller ( jt ) effect .",
    "this source of the localization was suggested to account for the fi ground state in la@xmath0ca@xmath14mno@xmath2 for 0.12 @xmath19 0.2 @xcite .",
    "the fi state can also be consequence of a spontaneous orbital ordering , which develops in a cubic manganite , due to a coupling of the spin and orbital degrees of freedom arising from the electron correlations @xcite .",
    "la@xmath20sr@xmath21mno@xmath2 was found to exhibit the fi state of such nature @xcite .",
    "note that a new explanation of the insulator to metal transition , which occurs in an orbital disordered state , has been suggested recently @xcite .",
    "this approach permits the existence an orbital liquid insulating state .",
    "as far as we know , however , such a state has not been found so far .    an important aspect of this problem is a nature of the paramagnetic ( p )  fi transition which can differ from that of a 3d isotropic ferromagnet .",
    "a few works have only concentrated on behavior at this critical point .",
    "an unconventional p - fi transition was observed in insulating la@xmath22ca@xmath23mno@xmath2 where a magnetic correlation length increased only from 10 to 35  as @xmath24 @xcite . to investigate this issue in detail",

    "the ordering of the nd moments , that develops below 20 k @xcite , changed the magnetic and transport properties @xcite .",
    "as study of the nd@xmath0sr@xmath14mno@xmath2 ( 0.1 @xmath16 0.5 ) showed , the nd magnetic subsystem came also into play at the low temperatures due to its ordering @xcite . at the same time , no effects of the mn - nd coupling were found near @xmath8 in the investigations of critical static behavior of nd@xmath27pb@xmath28mno@xmath2 @xcite and critical dynamics of nd@xmath0sr@xmath14mno@xmath2 ( @xmath29 0.5 ) @xcite .",
    "our studies have included the measurements of the linear and nonlinear susceptibilities as well as esr .",
    "the neutron diffraction investigations have been also performed to elucidate the effects of the lattice distortions and orbital ordering .",
    "the study of the critical magnetic properties of the @xmath3 = 0.23 ( @xmath4 124 k ) and @xmath3 = 0.25 ( @xmath4 129 k ) manganites revealed a more complicated scenario than that expected for the 3d isotropic ferromagnets @xcite . the conventional critical behavior was observed to proceed for @xmath30 where @xmath9 147 k ( @xmath3 = 0.23 ) and @xmath9 143 k ( @xmath3 = 0.25 ) .",
    "in contrast , the data on nonlinear response of the second order clearly indicated the occurrence of an anomalous critical behavior for @xmath31 that suggested the coexistence of the two magnetic phases . although the @xmath3 = 0.23 compound exhibited an orbital ordering due to the jt effect below @xmath32 350k , the neutron diffraction study did not reveal a two phase structure in the anomalous @xmath33range @xcite that would be a natural explanation of the phase separated ( ps ) magnetic state .",
    "in addition , according to the esr measurements , the transition did not become hysteretic in temperature and clearly first order .    in this paper",
    "we present the neutron diffraction , magnetization and esr investigations of @xmath3 = 0.25 manganite .",
    "the @xmath34 is reduced on doping , becoming @xmath7 250 k. a character of the jt distortions and orbital ordering differs from that of the @xmath3 = 0.23 compound .",
    "@xmath35-evolution of the structural parameters does not show any anomalies that can be definitely attributed to formation of a structural ps state in the anomalous @xmath35-range .",
    "the magnetization , @xmath36 , measurements are performed in the field cooled ( fc ) and zero field cooled ( zfc ) regimes at @xmath37 1 koe in a range 4.2 @xmath6 300 k. the fc data agree reasonably with prediction for a 3d isotropic ferromagnet in the paramagnetic critical region from 2@xmath8 down to @xmath8 .",

    "a relaxation rate of uniform magnetization @xmath38 and @xmath39-factor show nearly the same dependencies above @xmath12 as for the @xmath40 0.23 manganite . the @xmath41 does not exhibit a critical enhancement as it occurs in the conventional cubic ferromagnets cdcr@xmath42s@xmath43 and cdcr@xmath42se@xmath43 @xcite , as well as in the near to cubic manganites la@xmath0ca@xmath14mno@xmath2 ( @xmath44 @xcite . an anisotropic exchange mn - nd coupling is shown can give a substantial contribution in @xmath38 , masking the critical enhancement .",
    "in order to examine character of the phase transition , effect of the different temperature treatments of the sample on the esr signals is elucidated .",
    "these measurements and @xmath36 data support the existence of the magnetic ps state near @xmath8 .",
    "the possible reasons of origination of the heterophase magnetic state are discussed .",
    "the polycrystalline samples were prepared by the standard technology @xcite , an oxygen content being controlled by a thermogravimetric analysis .",
    "a 48-counter powder neutron diffractometer of pnpi with a wave length 1.83  of an incident neutron beam was used in the structural investigations .",
    "the measurements were performed in a cryostat at 4.2 @xmath6 300 k. program fullprof was employed for the structure refinement .",
    "the magnetization measurements were carried out using a squid magnetometer in a temperature range 4.2 @xmath6 300 k and a magnetic field 1 koe .",
    "a single crystal with a mass $ m$ = 91.8 mg was used that came from the same growth batch as the crystal of work @xcite .    in esr study ,",
    "the small part of single crystal investigated in work @xcite with a mass @xmath45 1.6 mg was used .",
    "we employed a special @xmath46-band esr spectrometer ( @xmath47 8.37 ghz ) described earlier @xcite .",
    "it registers a component of magnetization of a sample which is proportional to an off - diagonal part of its magnetic susceptibility ( @xmath48 ) when a linear polarized exciting @xmath49field * h*@xmath50 ox and a steady field * h*@xmath50 oz .    below @xmath9 143 k the nonlinear response of the compound reveals features of the ps magnetic state that can signal the first order transition @xcite .",
    "it is natural , therefore , to expect a temperature hysteresis of the esr signal .",
    "besides , a state forming at the ps usually depends on a process that is used to transfer a system in the ps regime .",
    "therefore , the several types of the temperature scan without / with an external magnetic field were performed .    1 .",
    "the sample was slowly cooled from room temperature down to 128 k below @xmath8 and then slowly heated back to room temperature . in the chosen temperature points ( @xmath33points ) the esr spectra were registered . a temporal stabilization time before recording a signal was about 200 - 300 seconds at each @xmath33points . 2 .",
    "the same temperature scan as above was applied but with @xmath51 = 4 koe during cooling between @xmath33points .",
    "this procedure also tests a possible ps state because the magnetic field can change a balance between the phase fractions .",
    "a fast cooling of the sample was used down to 128 k in zero @xmath51 and then the sample was slow heated up to room temperature .",
    "a neutron diffraction pattern at room temperature is plotted in fig.1 . similar to nd@xmath52ba@xmath53mno@xmath2 crystal @xcite , pseudocubic structure of nd@xmath54ba@xmath55mno@xmath2 exhibits distortions to a monoclinic symmetry , as the characteristic peaks at the low angles of scattering evidence ( see the insert in fig.1 ) .",
    "they unambiguously originate from a lattice deformation because the x - ray diffraction patterns also show them at room temperature .",
    "a width of the peaks is larger than that of the main bragg reflections .",
    "it indicates that the regions of the relatively small sizes possess the monoclinic distortions .",
    "the peaks exhibit no temperature variations and have a small amplitude .",
    "the presence of small amount of such a monoclinic phase is expected to have a minimal effect on the @xmath33dependent properties of this compound .",
    "the measured diffraction profiles are found to be well fitted using the orthorhombic @xmath5 space group .",
    "this fit gives only the slightly worse description than that of the monoclinic group @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the further analysis will be based on the @xmath5 setting .",
    "fig.2 displays the @xmath33variations of structural parameters .",
    "the orthorhombic distortions are small in range of the measurements as in the @xmath57 0.23 manganite @xcite .",
    "however , there are essential differences in their character .",
    "the data on the mn - o bond lengths ( fig.2c ) indicate that the jt transition from the high temperature orbital disordered @xmath58 phase to the @xmath59 phase possessing the cooperative jt distortions occurs at @xmath32 250 k. this transition involves the strong abrupt changes of the mn - o - mn angles between 220 @xmath6 290 k when the curves of monotonic @xmath33variation for the mn - o1-mn and mn - o2-mn angles cross one another ( fig.2d ) .",
    "this transformation is related to rotation of the mno@xmath60 octahedra around the pceudocubic [ 111 ] direction @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath61 transition is driven by both the jt distortions that underlie an orbital ordering and a steric effect ( the oxygen ion displacements connected to the octahedrons tilting ) .",
    "the latter leads to peculiarity of the transition when a relationship between the lattice parameters ( @xmath62 , fig.2a ) conserves above and below @xmath34 , the splitting @xmath63 becoming even smaller on cooling below @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath61 transition is not usually accompanied by the octahedral tilting . in this case",
    "@xmath64 above @xmath34 and @xmath65 below it , as it is found in lasr @xcite , laca @xcite and @xmath40 0.23 ndba @xcite manganites .",
    "the @xmath33variations of the lattice parameters and unit - cell volume ( fig.2a , b ) are observed above @xmath8 .",
    "they mainly reflect compression of the lattice on cooling which is related to reduction of the lattice parameter .",
    "this process completes at @xmath8 .",
    "the mn - o bound lengths ( fig.2c ) coincide above @xmath7 250 k and their splitting remains nearly temperature independent below 230 k , so that the jt phase forms in the narrow temperature interval .",
    "the splitting corresponds the orbital ordering closed to 3@xmath66 type which develops in the @xmath63 plane because dmn - o1 @xmath67 dmn - o22 @xmath68 dmn - o21 @xcite . in la@xmath0ca@xmath14mno@xmath2 ( 0.12 @xmath69 0.21 ) with the fi ground state , the jt - distortions monotonically increases on cooling over a large temperature interval @xcite . at @xmath40 0.2 , this behavior",
    "is observed from @xmath70 300 k @xmath71 down to 100 k. it was interpreted as the coexistence of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 phases i.e. as the structural ps state .",
    "although our measurements of the dmn - o are not a very high accuracy , they contradict the coexistence of the @xmath58 and @xmath59 phase with the comparable volume fractions even at 220 k , and support formation of the nearly structural uniform phase below 230 k. the @xmath33evolution of the structural parameters does not reveal any peculiarities in the anomalous @xmath33range ( @xmath9 143 k @xmath6 129 k @xmath72 ) which can be directly associated with the appearance of a two - phase structural state .",
    "note that a character of the jt distortions in the @xmath40 0.23 manganite below 150 k ( dmn - o21 - dmn - o1 @xmath67 dmn - o1 - dmno22 ) , where it depends weakly on temperature @xcite , differs from that of the @xmath40 0.25 manganite .",
    "thus , the fi state and the anomalous critical behavior can occur at the different types of these distortions .",
    "temperature dependence of the ferromagnetic moment ( fig.2b ) shows the usual behavior for a ferromagnet with @xmath4 129 k. the magnetic moment in the ground state 3.0(1 ) @xmath73 ( @xmath73 is the borh magneton ) is less than that of the mn sublattice 3.75 @xmath73 expected for this composition .",
    "this is mainly due to antiparallel alignment of the nd magnetic moment @xmath74 @xcite that gives the additive contribution in measured ferromagnetic moment of the sample .",
    "3 displays the temperature dependences of @xmath75 that are obtained in the fc and zfc measurements at @xmath51 = 1 koe .",
    "we consider first the fc data above @xmath8 . to determine a scaling behavior of susceptibility of the material @xmath76 , it is convenient to write inverse susceptibility of the sample @xmath77 as @xmath78    here @xmath76 = @xmath79((g\\mu)^2/v_0)\\tau^{-\\gamma}$ ] ( the conventional units )",
    ", @xmath80 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath81 is the numerical factor , @xmath39 is the @xmath82factor , @xmath83 41.45 @xmath84 is the volume of the unit magnetic cell and @xmath85 is the demagnetization factor .",
    "a fit of the data for 1 @xmath86 0.093 ( 258 k @xmath87 141 k ) with @xmath88 129 k and @xmath85 = 1/3 gives @xmath89 1.39(1 ) , @xmath90 2.95(3 ) for @xmath91 = 1.875 , these values being independent on @xmath85 for 0.25 @xmath92 0.4 ( see inset(1 ) in fig.3 ) .",
    "the same values of @xmath93 and @xmath81 are obtained by employing an interval 1 @xmath86 0.256 whereas the fit becomes worse below 141 k. this shows that @xmath51 = 1 koe affects the @xmath94 dependence only at @xmath95 0.093 .",
    "the @xmath96 linear response @xcite and esr measurements ( see fig.5 ) give a slightly less value of @xmath97 1.32 that is due to the demagnetization effects because a fit of the @xmath98 data yields also a close magnitude of @xmath93 .",
    "since the nonlinear response reveals the anomalous critical behavior in the low magnetic fields below @xmath9 143 k , it is important to check whether the critical @xmath99 dependence at @xmath51 = 1 koe is the conventional one or not in the same @xmath35-range .",
    "our @xmath99 data in this region are related mainly to an intermediate @xmath51-regime between the weak ( @xmath100 143 k ) and strong ( @xmath101 ) magnetic fields . as can be easily verified",
    ", a modified arrot plot scheme frequently employed for analysis of the critical @xmath102 dependences @xcite has the incorrect analytic properties in the weak fields .",
    "therefore we use another approximate equation of state @xcite with a correct behavior in the weak and strong fields .",
    "it can be presented in a convenient form as @xcite @xmath103    here @xmath104 0 , 1 @xmath105 0 are the coefficients , @xmath106 is the factor determining the amplitude of @xmath76 , @xmath107 + @xmath108 is the magnetic field index , @xmath108 is the index of the spontaneous magnetization , @xmath109 and @xmath110 is the internal field .",
    "the function @xmath111 decreases monotonically from 1 down to 0 as @xmath3 increases from 0 up to @xmath112 . the @xmath111 and , consequently , @xmath113 are the even functions of @xmath3 .",
    "they can be expended in the power series in @xmath114 for @xmath115 1 because eq.(3 ) can be presented as @xmath116 [ the right part]@xmath117 .",
    "strongly speaking , @xmath118 in this approximation .",
    "nevertheless , the parameters @xmath119 and @xmath120 ( or some of them ) can be treated as the free ones at an approximate fit ( @xmath93 has been determined earlier ) .",
    "insert ( 2 ) in fig.3a displays the best fit of @xmath113 at @xmath121 1.39 , @xmath122 5/3 ( the value for a 3d isotropic ferromagnet ) and @xmath123 1/3 for our sample closed to a cube .",
    "it gives @xmath124 0.98 that is not far from the theoretical value @xmath125 0.81 .",
    "we tried also to find @xmath120 using @xmath118 .",
    "this yields @xmath126 1.87 ( @xmath127 0.74 ) , the fit being worse .",
    "these results show that the @xmath128 dependence is comparably well described by the conventional scaling static theory in the anomalous region ( @xmath129 ) at @xmath130 1 koe .",
    "thus , the anomalous nonlinear critical behavior , that is detected by the @xmath131 measurements in the low magnetic fields ( @xmath132 100 oe ) , is suppressed by the stronger field .",
    "this means also that the anomalous phase occupies a relative small volume ( an upper border does not presumably exceed 1/5 ) .",
    "according to the fc and zfc data , @xmath133 exhibits the @xmath33hysteresis ( see fig.3a and inset in fig.3b ) .",
    "this phenomenon is usually observed in the manganaties below @xmath8 , whereas its presence above @xmath8 up to 300 k is the unexpected result .",
    "the @xmath134 + @xmath135 exhibits the maximum ( @xmath136 290 k , see fig.3b ) at high temperatures between 220 k and 300 k which can be attributed to the structural transition occurring in this @xmath33range . below 220 k , @xmath137 increases monotonically at @xmath138 .",
    "this means that difference @xmath139 - @xmath140 is not reduced to a @xmath35-independent distinguish in the parameters accounting for the @xmath139 and @xmath140 dependences .",
    "one may expect that observation of @xmath137 here is related to the two - phase coexistence .",
    "the @xmath131-measurements reveal the two - phase state below @xmath9 143 k as the anomalous nonlinear response becomes larger than the conventional one .",
    "here we use another way for disturbance of the system and analyze another quantity , so that the possible inhomogeneous magnetic state may be observed above @xmath12 . for instance , the increasing of @xmath137 on cooling below 220 k may reflect the differences in the @xmath35-dependences of the volume fractions and/or mutual arrangement of the phases . in addition , @xmath12 seems to be also seen in @xmath141 data as a temperature where @xmath142 has a maximum . at last , @xmath141 exhibits the maximum at @xmath8 .",
    "this corresponds to a conclusion based on the @xmath131-data @xcite that the ordering of both phases occurs simultaneously at @xmath8 .",
    "these observations agree with an assumption that formation of the two - phase state takes place independently of the structural transition and does not reduce to the coexistence of the @xmath59 and a small amount of the initial @xmath58 phases .",
    "note some peculiarities of the @xmath35-hysteresis below @xmath8 .",
    "according to fig.3a , difference between the fc and zfc data increases for @xmath143 90 k. this agrees with @xmath35-dependence of the hysteresis loop found in the re@xmath144 measurements .",
    "the modification seems to reflect change in a domain formation .",
    "below 20 k the @xmath145 exhibits the sharp reduction , indicating onset of ordering of the nd ions whose magnetization directed antiparallel to that of the mn moments .",
    "fig.4 shows the typical spectra for some temperatures obtained at different @xmath35-scans .",

    "a control sample ( a polycrystalline stable nitroxyl radical with @xmath39 = 2.055 and @xmath150 60 oe ) is used for tuning a phase of @xmath96 field which is the reference point for @xmath149 .",
    "the fitting parameters in eq.4 are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath149 and the amplitude of the signal @xmath151 .",
    "we consider first a range @xmath152 where the critical behavior follows to that of a 3d isotropic ferromagnet @xcite , and the structural refinement does not show any structural transformation .",

    "this behavior is observed in the traditional cubic ferromagnets @xcite and in the near to cubic manganites la@xmath0ca@xmath14mno@xmath169 0.22 ) with @xmath170 0.25 @xcite . in our compound",
    "@xmath41 reduces monotonically at @xmath171 .",
    "this dependence can not be described by the single term with @xmath165 and suggests the presence of a new relaxation mechanism .",
    "since nd@xmath172 ion has a magnetic moment and this magnetic subsystem is not presented in the indicated above compounds , a mn - nd coupling is the most likely to be additional source of the relaxation .",
    "the ground state of nd@xmath172 ion ( total moment @xmath173 = 9/2 , @xmath174 = 6 and @xmath91 = 3/2 ) is split by a low symmetric ( lower than cubic ) crystal field into the five doublets described by the effective spins @xmath91 = 1/2 .",
    "it is expected that a mn - nd exchange interaction @xmath175 is larger than that of the nd - nd @xcite .",
    "we will show that the weak anisotropic coupling @xmath175 can give the needed contribution in @xmath41 .",
    "the main effect of @xmath175 can be explained by taking into account the single ground doublet of the nd@xmath172 ion and neglecting the nd - nd interactions .",
    "we consider first a result of a perturbation theory for @xmath38 with @xmath176 , where * s*@xmath177 and * s*@xmath178 are spins of the mn and nd ( @xmath179 = 1/2 ) ions , respectively .",
    "a relaxation rate @xmath180 of total spin of the system * s = s@xmath181 + s@xmath42 * is determined by an anisotropy of @xmath182 .",
    "to get @xmath180 , a pair spin green function of the operators @xmath183 is analyzed @xcite .",

    ", we find @xmath194 .",
    "this answer differs from the critical term ( @xmath195 , eq.(2 ) ) in a factor @xmath196 since the critical contribution contains product of the two critical functions ( @xmath197 ) whereas @xmath198 that gives @xmath199 .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath180 is determined by anisotropic part of the @xmath175(*q * ) at * q * = 0 , where @xmath200(*q * ) is the fourier transform of @xmath201 , @xmath202 = @xmath203 8 is the coordination number of the mn - nd sublattice . this part is @xmath204 , where @xmath205 sp@xmath206 is the mean exchange coupling . generally speaking , one can find the different relaxation rates along the axes of the crystal .",
    "however , the anisotropy of @xmath38 is not observed .",
    "it can be due to a twinning of the crystal in the ( @xmath207 ) plane and an averaging of the relaxation rates by the circular polarized components of @xmath208 .",

    "this law is the consequence of decay of the uniform magnetization into the critical and uncritical modes which is enforced by the anisotropy , a characteristic energy of the free nd - spins being obviously equal to zero .",
    "note that the same contribution in @xmath38 appears also as an uncritical ( or rather intermediate ) mode has an uncritical amplitude ( @xmath212 ) and a characteristic energy that is equal that of the critical mode .",
    "this occurs in some cubic collinear ferrimagnets @xcite .    to determine a region of the validity for this result , the equations of motion for the green functions @xmath213(*q*,@xmath148 ) and @xmath214(*q*,@xmath148 ) at * q * = 0 should be considered .",
    "the @xmath215 introduces a frequency scale @xmath216 in @xmath217 that gives the main restriction .",
    "the @xmath215 is assumed to be rather anisotropic @xmath218 .",
    "this is not unusual situation for the exchange coupling between the @xmath219 and @xmath220 ions in the perovskite lattice and an estimation given below supports this assumption .",
    "therefore , one can use the isotropic component @xmath221 to get @xmath216 .",
    "the traditional mode coupling theory @xcite yields @xmath222 .",

    "note that the small anisotropic spin interactions in the nd subsystem @xmath231 ( for instance , the dipolar forces ) give an additional contribution in @xmath165 .",
    "they do not effect @xmath232 if @xmath233 .",
    "we have discussed above dynamics of the * s * which coincides with that of the total magnetization * m * when the @xmath39-factors of the mn ( @xmath234 ) and nd ( @xmath235 ) ions are isotropic and equal to each other .",
    "the anisotropy of @xmath236 can be neglected whereas that of @xmath237 may be substantial . consider first a case of isotropic @xmath238 .",
    "when @xmath175 = 0 , the spectrum reveals the two resonance at @xmath239 . with increasing of isotropic part of the mn - nd exchange ,",

    "this dependence suggests that nd magnetization is induced by the ordered mn subsystem , i.e. it is due to the splitting of the nd ground kramers doublet by the mean field of the mn spins . assuming that @xmath221 dominates and @xmath273 2",
    ", we find @xmath274 5 k of the same order as @xmath275 .",

    "the @xmath232 is close to the minimal @xmath160 0.13 which is available for the precise analysis of the @xmath41 .",
    "since @xmath41 can not exhibit a critical enhancement in the anisotropic regime , this effect is completely destroyed in our compound that is confirmed by estimation of the line width at @xmath95 0.13 .",
    "the anisotropic static crossover occurs at a very small @xmath280 ( @xmath281 + 0.5 k ) .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore , that @xmath94 dependence of our compound and the static critical properties of nd@xmath27pb@xmath28mno@xmath2 ( @xmath282 156 k ) @xcite correspond to those of a 3d isotropic ferromagnet .",
    "we have characterized above the nd@xmath172 ion by its single ground doublet .",
    "other states are ineffective if a distance between the ground doublet and a next one is larger than 2@xmath8 .",
    "it can be a realistic situation , since a cubic component , which dominates in the crystal field of the weakly distorted cubic crystal , can produce a large splitting between the ground doublet and the two upper quartets .",
    "in a comparably strongly distorted ndcuo@xmath43 , for example , this splitting is 15 mev whereas the total splitting is 109 mev @xcite .",
    "if the next several states are relevant they can be simply taken into account since a distance between the neighboring doublets is definitely larger than mn - nd exchange . in this case",
    "these states can be treated separately by the same manner as the ground state so that they produce the obvious additive effect .",
    "we consider now the esr data below @xmath12 where a pronounced deviation of the signal from lorenzian starts to be observed .",
    "a reason is that im4@xmath283 1 at @xmath284 as 4@xmath285 1 ( 4@xmath286 0.6 at @xmath12 ) .",
    "this leads to a complex nonuniform distribution of the @xmath49field in the sample because a wave vector @xmath80 in a medium @xmath287 for a wave spreading along * h * , where , for simplicity , we neglected the @xmath288 . as a result ,",
    "phase @xmath149 of the signal begins to exhibit a strong @xmath51-dependence that can not be correctly determined for our sample in the resonator .",
    "therefore below @xmath12 , we present directly the signals for the several types of the @xmath35-scans .",
    "the pronounced @xmath35-hysteresis observed in all the measurements ( fig.4 ) is the clear indication of the anomalous behavior that develops below @xmath12 .",
    "since a precise quantitative analysis of the signal is not feasible here , we can not determine whether this hysteresis is caused by that of @xmath75 or it is related also to hysteresis of the @xmath38 and @xmath82factor .",
    "a rough estimation gives approximately @xmath35-independent values for @xmath38 and @xmath82factor below @xmath12 down to @xmath8 .",
    "the same reason does not allow us to elucidate a possible two - phase character of the signal . at the same time , above @xmath12 phase @xmath149",
    "reflects mainly phase shift of the @xmath208 in the sample which is related to a comparably large @xmath289 10 and conductivity @xmath290 .",
    "this effect , being independent of @xmath51 , can be taken into account correctly by eq.(4 ) .",
    "for the largest conductivity ( @xmath291cm)@xmath292 ) at @xmath293 260 k , we get @xmath294 0.25 for @xmath295 1 , were @xmath296 0.1 mm is the thickness of the sample . since @xmath290 decreases sharply on cooling ( @xmath297 ( @xmath298cm)@xmath292 at @xmath12 ) , the @xmath299-distribution in the sample is closed to uniform between @xmath12 and @xmath300 .",
    "the @xmath35-hysteresis observed in the magnetization and esr measurements above @xmath8 evidences at least a weak first order transition . according to the @xmath131-data , a reason of changing regime of the transition at @xmath12 is formation of the new phase with the anomalous strong nonlinear magnetic behavior in the weak fields which is stronger than that of a 3d isotropic ferromagnet near @xmath8 .",
    "this phase coexists with the normal one at least from @xmath12 down to @xmath8 .",
    "this ps magnetic state can not be trivially related to a two - phase structure because , according to the neutron diffraction , the sample remains the structural uniform compound below @xmath12 .",
    "note that , first , the anomalous phase coexists with the conventional one possessing the different orbital ordering for the @xmath3 = 0.23 and @xmath3 = 0.25 compounds .",
    "second , it arises in the manganites that are closed to border of the i - m transition ( @xmath301 0.3 ) , where , according to ref.@xcite and our preliminarily data , the orbital ordering disappears .",
    "these observations suggest that the anomalous behavior can be attributed to an orbital disordered metallic phase .",
    "the lack of observability of the anomalous phase in the structural measurements means that this phase is structurally closed to the conventional one and/or its volume is small .",
    "fragmentation of the sample in the ps state may be such that the anomalous phase does not form a percolative conductive cluster , and the system remains an insulator .",
    "the strong @xmath51-nonlinear behavior of this phase is expected to be a combined effect of its own properties and a magnetic coupling of its fragments through the normal phase with the developed ferromagnetic correlations .",
    "it is very important to stress a difference between this transition and a first order one whose character is determined on the base of @xmath36 data . in the latter , type of the transition ( first / second ) is characterized by sign of coefficient @xmath302 in an expansion of @xmath303 in @xmath304 above @xmath8 : @xmath305 ( @xmath306 0 ( first order ) , @xmath307 0 ( second order ) ) .",
    "such a criterion suggests that the magnetization is the single critical degree of freedom accounting for the transition .",
    "this peculiarity is indeed observed in the @xmath36 dependence of traditional ferromagnet mnas @xcite and a number of the manganites @xcite . besides the conventional @xmath36 measurements , sign of @xmath302 can be found from the @xmath131-data because re@xmath308 for @xmath309 0 and a small @xmath148 when re@xmath131 dominates in the response @xcite .",
    "our results on the @xmath3 = 0.23 and @xmath3 = 0.25 compounds obtained by this method indicate clearly that @xmath307 0 for both coexisting phases @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath75 is not the single degree of freedom involved in the transition , and one should consider the charge , orbital and jt - phonon variables ( or some of them ) as the critical ones as well .",
    "it is not the unexpected conclusion for the manganites that are characterized by close interconnection of the magnetization and these degrees of freedom . in our system , the charge and orbital degrees of freedom together with @xmath75 are the most likely to be the critical variables",
