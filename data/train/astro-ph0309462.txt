    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most brilliant events in the universe .",
    "long regarded as an exotic enigma , they have taken center stage in high - energy astrophysics by virtue of the spectacular discoveries of the past six years .",
    "it is now clear that they also have important applications in many other areas of astronomy : grbs mark the moment of `` first light '' in the universe ; they are tracers of the star formation , re - ionization , and metallicity histories of the universe ; and they are laboratories for studying core - collapse supernovae .",
    "three major milestones have marked this journey . in 1992 , results from the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on board the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _ ruled out the previous paradigm ( in which grbs were thought to come from a thick disk of neutron stars in our own galaxy , the milky way ) , and hinted that the bursts might be cosmological @xcite . in 1997 , results made possible by _",
    "beppo_sax @xcite decisively determined the distance scale to long grbs ( showing that they lie at cosmological distances ) , and provided circumstantial evidence that long bursts are associated with the deaths of massive stars ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in 2003 , results made possible by the high energy explorer satellite 2 ( hete-2 ) @xcite dramatically confirmed the grb ",
    "sn connection and firmly established that long bursts are associated with type ic core collapse supernovae .",
    "thus we now know that the progenitors of long grbs are massive stars .",
    "the hete-2 mission has been highly productive in addition to achieving this breakthrough :    * hete-2 is currently localizing 25 - 30 grbs per year ; * hete-2 has accurately and rapidly localized 43 grbs in 2 1/2 years of operation ( compared to 52 grbs localized by _",
    "beppo_sax during its 6-year mission ) ; 14 of these have been localized to @xmath0 arcmin accuracy by the sxc plus wxm .",
    "* 21 of these localizations have led to the identification of the x - ray , optical , or radio afterglow of the burst . * as of the present time , redshift determinations have been reported for 11 of the bursts with afterglows ( compared to 13 _ beppo_sax bursts with redshift determinations ) . * hete-2 has detected 16 xrfs so far ( compared to 17 by _",
    "beppo_sax ) .",
    "* hete-2 has observed 25 bursts from the soft gamma - ray repeaters 1806 - 20 and 1900 + 14 in the summer of 2001 ; 2 in the summer of 2002 ; and 18 so far in 2003 .",
    "it has discovered a possible new sgr : 1808 - 20 .",
    "* hete-2 has observed @xmath1 170 x - ray bursts ( xrbs ) in the summer of 2001 , @xmath2 500 in the summer of 2002 , and @xmath2 150 so far in 2003 from @xmath1 20 sources .",
    "( we pointed hete-2 toward the galactic plane during the summer of 2002 and caught a large number of xrbs in order to calibrate new sxc flight software . )",
    "fourteen grbs have been localized by the hete-2 wxm plus sxc so far .",
    "remarkably , all 14 have led to the identification of an x - ray , optical , infrared , or radio afterglow ; and 13 of 14 have led to the identification of an optical afterglow .",
    "in contrast , only @xmath3 35% of bepposax localizations led to the identification of an optical afterglow .",
    "confirmation of the grb ",
    "sn connection is a singular achievement and certainly one of the scientific highlights of the hete-2 mission .",
    "other highlights of the mission include the following :    * hete-2 made possible rapid follow - up observations of a short grb , allowing severe constraints to be placed on the brightness of any x - ray or optical afterglow . * the rapid follow - up",
    "observations made possible by hete-2 have opened the era of high - resolution spectroscopy of optical afterglows ( e.g , grbs 020813 , 021004 , and 030329 ) . * accurate , rapid hete-2 localizations sent to ground - based robotic telescopes have made it possible to explore the previously unknown behavior of optical afterglows in the 3 - 20 hour `` gap '' immediately following the burst that existed in the _",
    "beppo_sax era .",
    "this has confirmed the existence of a very bright , distinct phase lasting @xmath3 10 minutes .",
    "* hete-2 is solving the mystery of `` optically dark '' grbs .",
    "as already remarked upon , the identification of an optical afterglow for 13 of 14 grbs localized by the sxc plus wxm instruments on hete-2 has shown that very few long grbs are truly `` optically dark . ''",
    "* optical and nir follow - up observations made possible by hete-2 have provided the best case to date of a grb whose optical afterglow has been extinguished by dust , and several examples of grbs with exceptionally dim optical afterglows .",
    "these grbs would very likely have been classified as `` optically dark '' were it not for the accurate , rapid localizations provided by hete-2 .",
    "* hete-2 is revealing the nature of x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) .",
    "specifically , hete-2 has provided strong evidence that the properties of xrfs , x - ray - rich grbs , and grbs form a continuum , and therefore that these three types of bursts are the same phenomenon . *",
    "hete-2 results also show that xrfs may provide unique insights into the nature of grb jets , the rate of grbs , and the role of grbs in type ic supernovae .",
    "in particular , the hete-2 results provide evidence that grb jets are uniform rather than structured .",
    "they also suggest that the jets are very narrow , and that the rate of grbs may be much larger than has been thought .",
    "there has been increasing circumstantial and tantalizing direct evidence in the last few years that grbs are associated with core collapse supernovae ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the detection and localization of grb 030329 by hete-2 @xcite led to a dramatic confirmation of the grb ",
    "sn connection .",
    "grb 030329 was among the brightest 1% of grbs ever seen .",
    "its optical afterglow was @xmath4 magnitude at 1.5 hours after the burst @xcite  more than 3 magnitudes brighter than the famous optical afterglow of grb 990123 at a similar time @xcite .",
    "in addition , the burst source and its host galaxy lie very nearby , at a redshift @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "given that grbs typically occur at @xmath6 = 1 - 2 , the probability that the source of an observed burst should be as close as grb 030329 is one in several thousand .",
    "it is therefore very unlikely that hete-2 , or even _ swift _ , will see another such event .",
    "the fact that grb 030329 was very bright spurred the astronomical community  both amateurs and professionals  to make an unprecedented number of observations of the optical afterglow of this event .",
    "figure 1 shows the light curve of the optical afterglow of grb 030329 1 - 10 days after the burst .",
    "at least four dramatic `` re - brightenings '' of the afterglow are evident in the saw - toothed lightcurve .",
    "these may be due to repeated injections of energy into the grb jet by the central engine at late times , or caused by the ultra - relativistic jet ramming into dense blobs or shells of material @xcite .",
    "if the former , it implies that the central engine continued to pour out energy long after the grb was over ; if the latter , it likely provides information about the last weeks and days of the progenitor star .",
    "the fact that grb 030329 was very nearby made its optical afterglow an ideal target for attempts to confirm the conjectured association between grbs and core collapse sne .",
    "astronomers were not disappointed : about ten days after the burst , the spectral signature of an energetic type ic supernova emerged @xcite .",
    "the supernova has been designated sn 2003dh .",
    "figure 2 compares the discovery spectrum of sn 2003dh in the afterglow light curve of grb 030329 and the spectrum of the type ic supernova sn 1998bw .",
    "the similarity is striking .",
    "the breadth and the shallowness of the absorption lines in the spectra of sn 2003dh imply expansion velocities of @xmath3 36,000 km s@xmath7  far higher than those seen in typical type ic supernovae , and higher even than those seen in sn 1998bw .",
    "it had been conjectured that grb 980425 was associated with sn 1998bw ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , but the fact that , if the association were true , the burst would have had to have been @xmath8 times fainter than any other grb observed to date made the association suspect .",
    "the clear detection of sn 2003dh in the afterglow of grb 030329 confirmed decisively the connection between grbs and core collapse sne .",
    "the association between grb 030329 and sn 2003dh makes it clear that we must understand type ic sne in order to understand grbs .",
    "the converse is also true : we must understand grbs in order to fully understand type ic sne .",
    "it is possible that the creation of a powerful ultra - relativistic jet as a result of the collapse of the core of a massive star to a black hole plays a direct role in type ic supernova explosions @xcite , but it is certain that the rapid rotation of the collapsing core implied by such jets must be an important factor in some  perhaps many  type ic supernovae .",
    "the result will often be a highly asymmetric explosion , whether the result of rapid rotation alone or of the creation of powerful magnetic fields as a result of the rapid rotation @xcite .",
    "the large linear polarizations measured in several bright grb afterglows , and especially the temporal variations in the linear polarization ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , provide strong evidence that the type ic supernova explosions associated with grbs are highly asymmetric .",
    "the recent dramatic discovery that grb 021206 was strongly polarized @xcite provides evidence that grb jets are in fact dominated by magnetic energy rather than hydrodynamic energy .",
    "in addition , the x - ray afterglows of several grbs have provided tantalizing evidence of the presence of emission lines of @xmath9-particle nuclei @xcite .",
    "these emission lines , if confirmed , provide severe constraints on models of grbs and type ic supernovae [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] .",
    "they may also provide information on the abundances and properties of heavy elements that have been freshly minted in the supernova explosion .",
    "it is therefore now clear that grbs are a unique laboratory for studying , and are a powerful tool for understanding , type ic core collapse supernovae .",
    "confirmation by hete-2 of the connection between grbs and type ic supernovae has also strengthened the expectation that grbs occur out to redshifts @xmath10 , and are therefore a powerful probe of cosmology and the early universe .",
    "assuming that short bursts follow the star - formation rate ( as long bursts are thought to do ) , one can show @xcite that the peak luminosities of short bursts are essentially the same as those of long bursts .",
    "otherwise , little is known about the distance scale or the nature of short grbs .",
    "_ beppo_sax did not detect any short , hard grbs during its 6-year mission , despite extensive efforts .",
    "the rapid hete-2 and ipn localizations of grb 020531 @xcite made possible rapid optical ( @xmath11 = 2 - 3 hours ) follow - up observations .",
    "no optical afterglow was detected @xcite .",
    "chandra follow - up observations at @xmath12 days showed that @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "these results suggest that real time or near - real time x - ray follow - up observations of short grbs may be vital to unraveling the mystery of short grbs .",
    "only @xmath3 35% of _ beppo_sax localizations of grbs led to the identification of an optical afterglow .",
    "in contrast , 13 of the 14 grbs localized so far by the wxm plus the sxc on hete-2 have optical afterglows .",
    "hete-2 is thus solving the mystery of `` optically dark '' bursts .",
    "three explanations of `` optically dark '' grbs have been widely discussed :    * the optical afterglow is extinguished by dust in the vicinity of the grb or in the star - forming region in which the grb occurs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . *",
    "the grb lies at very high redshift ( @xmath14 ) , and the optical afterglow is absorbed by neutral hydrogen in the host galaxy and in the intergalactic medium along the line of sight from the burst to us @xcite . * some grbs have optical afterglows that are intrinsically very faint ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "rapid optical follow - up observations of the hete-2localized burst grb030115 @xcite show that the optical afterglow of this burst is the best case observed to date of a burst whose optical afterglow is extinguished by dust .",
    "figure 3 shows the nir and optical afterglow spectrum of this burst and the best - fit model , assuming extinction by dust @xcite .",
    "the amount of extinction by dust is a sensitive function of the redshift of the burst .",
    "since the redshift of this burst has not been reported as yet , the case shown in figure 3 assumes @xmath15 , the largest redshift allowed by the observations and the one that attributes the _",
    "least _ amount of extinction by dust .",
    "the amount of extinction by dust in the optical is still substantial .",
    "rapid optical follow - up observations @xcite of the hete-2localized burst grb 021211 @xcite show that the optical afterglow of this burst is intrinsically much fainter than those observed previously .",
    "figure 4 shows the light curve of the afterglow of grb 021211 @xcite .",
    "the transition from the reverse shock component @xcite to the forward shock component is clearly visible .",
    "figure 4 also compares the afterglow of grb 021211 to those of other grbs .",
    "these observations show that the light curve of the afterglow of this burst tracks those of grbs 990123 and 030329 , but is three and six magnitudes fainter than them .",
    "this burst would almost certainly have been classified as `` optically dark '' were it not for its accurate , rapid localization by hete-2 .",
    "upper limits or measurements of the optical afterglows of other _ beppo_sax and hete-2localized bursts suggest that they too have afterglows that are very faint ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "grbs with intrinsically faint afterglows may therefore account for a substantial fraction of bursts previously classified as `` optically dark . ''",
    "the temporal behavior of the optical afterglow of the hete-2localized burst grb 021004 was nearly flat at early times  a behavior that is different than any seen previously and that suggests the `` central engine '' powering the grb continued to pour out energy long after the burst itself was over@xcite .",
    "thus hete-2 is making it possible to explore the previously unknown behavior of grb afterglows in the `` gap '' in time from the end of the burst to 3 - 20 hours after the burst that existed in the _",
    "beppo_sax era .",
    "hete-2 has decisively confirmed the connection between grbs and the deaths of massive stars , as we have seen .",
    "the earliest massive stars are thought to have formed at redshifts @xmath16 @xcite and died soon thereafter .",
    "thus grbs may mark the moment of `` first light '' and an end to the `` dark ages '' of the universe .",
    "indeed , recent calculations suggest that 10 - 40% of all grbs may lie at very high ( @xmath14 ) redshifts @xcite .",
    "grbs are far and away the brightest objects in the universe , with @xmath17-ray luminosities that are frequently 10 billion times greater than the optical luminosities of the supernovae with which they are associated , or of their host galaxies .",
    "it is no surprise , then , that the bursts are easily detectable out to redshifts @xmath16 by hete-2 .    somewhat surprisingly , the infrared and near - ir afterglows of grbs are also detectable out to very high redshifts @xcite .",
    "the reason is that while the increase in distance and the redshift of the spectrum tend to reduce the spectral flux in a given frequency band , cosmological time dilation tends to increase it at a fixed time of observation after the grb , since afterglow intensities decrease with time .",
    "these effects combine to produce little or no decrease  and can even produce an increase  in the spectral energy flux of grb afterglows beyond @xmath18 @xcite . consequently ,",
    "`` optically dark , '' but `` near - infrared and infrared bright , '' grbs may be a powerful probe of cosmology and the early universe .",
    "figure 5 places grbs in a cosmological context @xcite . at recombination , which occurs at redshift @xmath19 ,",
    "the universe becomes transparent .",
    "the cosmic background radiation originates at this redshift . shortly afterward",
    ", the temperature of the cosmic background radiation falls below 3000 k and the universe enters the `` dark ages '' during which there is no visible light in the universe .",
    "`` first light , '' which occurs at @xmath16 , corresponds to the epoch when the first stars form .",
    "ultraviolet radiation from these first stars and/or from the first active galactic nuclei re - ionizes the universe .",
    "afterward , the universe is transparent in the ultraviolet .",
    "important cosmological questions that observations of grbs and their afterglows may address include the following @xcite :    @xmath20 the moment of `` first light '' and the earliest generations of stars merely by the detection of grbs at very high redshifts ;    @xmath20 the re - ionization of the universe by the shape of the red damping wing of the gunn - peterson trough due to lyman @xmath9 in the spectra of grb afterglows .",
    "@xmath20 the history of metallicity growth in the universe  in the star - forming entities in which the bursts occur , in damped lyman @xmath9 clouds , and in the lyman @xmath9 forest  by observations of metal absorption line systems in the spectra of grb afterglows ; and    @xmath20 the large - scale structure of the universe at very high redshifts ( @xmath14 ) by the clustering of lyman @xmath9 forest lines and the metal absorption - line systems in the spectra of their afterglows .",
    "the recently announced results from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe indicate that re - ionization of the universe occurred at @xmath21 @xcite , much earlier than previously thought .",
    "such redshifts are far beyond those that can be probed using quasars or even ly@xmath9-emission galaxies . in contrast , grbs are expected to occur out to the redshifts ( @xmath16 ) at which the first stars formed , stars whose uv light evidently re - ionizes the universe .",
    "thus , grbs may provide a unique probe of the re - ionization of the universe and the moment of `` first light . ''",
    "hete-2 has provided evidence that the isotropic - equivalent energies @xmath22 and luminosities @xmath23 of grbs are correlated with redshift @xcite ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "the apparent correlations imply that grbs evolve strongly with redshift  bursts at @xmath24 appear to be @xmath1 400 times more luminous than those at @xmath25 .",
    "these results strengthen evidence to this effect from analyses of the batse catalog of grbs , using the variability of burst time histories as an estimator of burst luminosities ( and therefore redshifts ) @xcite , and from an analysis of _",
    "beppo_sax bursts only @xcite .",
    "strong evolution of @xmath22 and @xmath23 with @xmath6 would have profound implications for the nature of grb progenitors and for the use of grbs a a probe of cosmology and the early universe .",
    "the hete-2 results suggest that grbs at redshifts @xmath6 = 10 - 20 may be much more luminous  and therefore easier to detect  than has been thought , making grbs a more powerful probe of the very high redshift universe .",
    "two - thirds of all hete-2localized bursts are either `` x - ray - rich '' or xrfs , and one - third are xrfs ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "> -0.5 $ ] and 0.0 , respectively . ]",
    "these events have received increasing attention in the past several years @xcite , but their nature remains largely unknown .    clarifying the nature of xrfs and x - ray - rich grbs , and their connection to grbs , could provide a breakthrough in our understanding of the prompt emission of grbs .",
    "the spectrum of the hete-2localized event xrf 020903 @xcite gave an upper limit @xmath26 5 kev ( 99.7% confidence level ) making this event one of the softest bursts seen so far by hete-2 .",
    "follow - up observations made possible by the hete-2 localization identified the likely optical afterglow of the xrf @xcite .",
    "later observations determined that the optical transient occurred in a star - forming galaxy at a distance @xmath27 @xcite ; both of these properties are typical of grb host galaxies .    analyzing 42 x - ray - rich grbs and xrfs seen by fregate and/or the wxm instruments on hete-2 , @xcite find that the xrfs , the x - ray - rich grbs , and grbs form a continuum in the [ @xmath28-plane ( see figure 8) .",
    "this result strongly suggests that all three kinds of events are the same phenomenon .",
    "furthermore , @xcite have placed 9 hete-2 grbs with known redshifts and 2 xrfs with known redshifts or strong redshift constraints in the ( @xmath29)-plane ( see figure 9 ) . here",
    "@xmath22 is the isotropic - equivalent burst energy and @xmath30 is the energy of the peak of the burst spectrum , measured in the source frame .",
    "the hete-2 bursts confirm the relation between @xmath31 and @xmath32 found by amati et al .",
    "@xcite for grbs and extend it down in @xmath22 by a factor of 300 .",
    "the fact that xrf 020903 , one of the softest events localized by hete-2 to date , and xrf 030723 , the most recent xrf localized by hete-2 , lie squarely on this relation @xcite provides additional evidence that xrfs and grbs are the same phenomenon .",
    "however , additional redshift determinations are clearly needed for xrfs with 1 kev @xmath33 kev energy in order to confirm these results .",
    "the hete-2 mission has been highly productive .",
    "it has observed more than 250 grbs so far .",
    "it is currently localizing 25 - 30 grbs per year , and has localized 43 grbs to date .",
    "twenty - one of these localizations have led to the detection of x - ray , optical , or radio afterglows , and as of now , 11 of the bursts with afterglows have redshift determinations .",
    "hete-2 has also observed more than 45 bursts from soft gamma - ray repeaters , and more than 700 x - ray bursts .",
    "hete-2 has confirmed the connection between grbs and type ic supernovae , a singular achievement and certainly one of the scientific highlights of the mission so far .",
    "it has provided evidence that the isotropic - equivalent energies and luminosities of grbs are correlated with redshift , implying that grbs and their progenitors evolve strongly with redshift . both of these results have profound implications for the nature of grb progenitors and for the use of grbs as a probe of cosmology and the early universe .",
    "hete-2 has placed severe constraints on any x - ray or optical afterglow of a short grb .",
    "it has made it possible to explore the previously unknown behavior optical afterglows at very early times , and has opened up the era of high - resolution spectroscopy of grb optical afterglows .",
    "it is also solving the mystery of `` optically dark '' grbs , and revealing the nature of x - ray flashes .",

    "<S> the hete-2 mission has been highly productive . </S>",
    "<S> it has observed more than 250 grbs so far . </S>",
    "<S> it is currently localizing 25 - 30 grbs per year , and has localized 43 grbs to date . </S>",
    "<S> twenty - one of these localizations have led to the detection of x - ray , optical , or radio afterglows , and as of now , 11 of the bursts with afterglows have known redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> hete-2 has confirmed the connection between grbs and type ic supernovae , a singular achievement and certainly one of the scientific highlights of the mission so far . </S>",
    "<S> it has provided evidence that the isotropic - equivalent energies and luminosities of grbs are correlated with redshift , implying that grbs and their progenitors evolve strongly with redshift . both of these results have profound implications for the nature of grb progenitors and for the use of grbs as a probe of cosmology and the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> hete-2 has placed severe constraints on any x - ray or optical afterglow of a short grb . </S>",
    "<S> it is also solving the mystery of `` optically dark '' grbs , and revealing the nature of x - ray flashes . </S>"
