    "in the discovery of machos light has shown its power to reveal dark compact objects . in these events",
    "the photon from a distant source suffers a very small angular deflection , small enough to make gravitational lensing the relevant mechanism .",
    "the bending power of a black hole is not limited , however , to small angles but reaches to @xmath0 and odd multiples of @xmath0 . illuminated by a powerful point source of light , the black hole",
    "therefore will shine back with a series of concentric rings ( we call this retrolensing ) .",
    "a waterdrop , too , likewise illuminated , shines back , but for a different reason : the internal reflections experienced by the photons . that returned light shows to the air traveler flying over a fogbank as a `` glory '' : a rainbow - like halo surrounding the shadow of the plane on the cloud .",
    "each ray of light that contributes to this sensation has suffered its @xmath0 deflection in a different waterdrop , therefore the impression of colored rings that the glory makes is impression only , built up in the last analysis out of multitudes of tiny dots of illumination .",
    "no one would be so rash as to expect a detectable backscatter from a single water droplet .",
    "it is precisely the search for such backscatter from a single black hole ( the putative retro - macho ) that is , however , the topic of this paper .",
    "how search for retro - machos , for `` @xmath0 in the sky '' , especially when dogged by the negative implications of the familiar phrase ?",
    "to tell observers to go and look everywhere is to them as dismaying as to be told to look nowhere .",
    "fortunately the successful search for machos provides a helpful model , and the records from that search an immediate place of reference .",
    "recent microlensing events appear to directly confirm that a population of stellar - mass black holes exists in our galaxy  @xcite .",
    "the sun , in turn , furnishes a powerful nearby source with whose help one can hope to search a nearby region of the galaxy for black holes not otherwise revealed , taking advantage of times when the earth interposes itself to spare the registering device from the direct glare of the light source .",
    "although the observation of a retro - macho is unlikely , it nonetheless affords one of the few ways to directly image nearby black holes , and if ever observed , would make for an impressive confirmation of einstein s theory .",
    "consider a point source of light , an observer , and a black hole lens , with all three co - linear and the observer located _ in between _ the source and black hole .",
    "the observer , looking at the image of the source in the black hole , will see ( resulting from symmetry ) an ( infinite ) series of concentric rings , corresponding to bending angles of successively higher odd multiples of @xmath0",
    ". the outermost ring would be from photons suffering a @xmath0 deflection , the next inner ring corresponding to a @xmath4 deflection , and so on .",
    "for a point source , and in the limit of geometric optics , the amplification of the rings in infinite .",
    "for realistic scenarios with extended sources , however , the amplification is finite .",
    "for example , consider an extended spherically symmetric source emitting uniformly across its surface .",
    "the image of the source at the observer is an annulus , where the outer and inner radii correspond to the appropriate impact parameters for photons coming from the top and bottom parts of the source , as shown in fig .",
    "[ perfect_align ] . since lensing conserves surface brightness",
    ", the brightness of the ring image relative to that of the source is given by the ratio of the areas of the images , as seen at the observer .",
    "the fraction of the sky covered by the ring image is given by : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the impact parameters corresponding to the inner and outer radii of the ring , respectively .",
    "note that the impact parameter is not the same as the periastron ( closest approach ) distance : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the impact parameter , @xmath10 is the periastron distance , and @xmath1 is the mass of the black hole . throughout",
    "we measure all quantities in geometric units , with @xmath11 ( e.g. , @xmath12 ) .",
    "this is to be compared with the sky coverage of the source , as seen directly by the observer : @xmath13 the total amplification , @xmath14 , of the image is given by the ratio of their sky coverages , yielding @xmath15    to calculate the brightness of the image we need to know the inner and outer radii of the ring , represented by rays from points @xmath16 and @xmath17 in fig .  1 , respectively .",
    "rays from @xmath16 suffer a deflection angle of @xmath18 , while for those from @xmath17 the deflection is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 . in everything that follows , we restrict our attention to the primary ( outermost , brightest ) images , although a whole succession of images is present ( corresponding to higher odd multiples of @xmath0 ) .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we confine ourselves to the case of non - rotating ( schwarzschild ) black holes .",
    "the calculations for rotating ( kerr ) holes are significantly more complex  @xcite , and will be deferred to later work . to calculate the impact parameters that correspond to the necessary deflection angles , we take advantage of an approximate expression in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) for the case of large deflection : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the deflection angle .",
    "chandrasekhar also provides exact analytic forms for the solution ( in terms of elliptic functions ) .",
    "we find that the approximate expressions are within @xmath25 of the exact values for bend angles satisfying @xmath26 , and are good to within @xmath27 for bend angles with @xmath28 .    using the results of eq .",
    "[ chandra_approx ] to calculate @xmath7 and @xmath6 , eq .",
    "[ eq : mu_1 ] can be simplified to @xmath29 eq .",
    "[ result1 ] assumes perfect ( colinear ) alignment of the source , observer , and lens .",
    "the generic case , of course , will involve misalignment , as shown in fig .",
    "we define the misalignment angle , @xmath30 , to be the angle between the source  observer line and the observer  lens line , as measured at the observer ( such that @xmath31 corresponds to the case of perfect alignment shown in fig .  1 ) .",
    "as @xmath30 increases from zero the ring    splits into two arcs ( on either side of the lens ) , centered on the lens  observer  source plane ( see the inset of fig .",
    "2 ) , with the arcs shrinking to small , point - like images as @xmath30 approaches @xmath32 .",
    "the tangential extent of these arcs , as seen at the observer , is determined by the angular extent of the protrusion of the source out of the plane of fig .  2 : @xmath33 .",
    "the total area of each image is thus found to be @xmath34 where we have neglected the fact that the image heights taper down to zero at their edges . here",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath6 represent the outer and inner apparent impact parameters of the images , which correspond to bend angles of @xmath35 for the bigger image , and @xmath36 for the smaller image .",
    "note that , since surface brightness is conserved , the bigger image is also the brighter one ( and is found further from the center of the lens , on the side opposite that of the source ) . the magnification of each image is again given by the ratio of the areas of the source and image , namely : @xmath37 in the limit @xmath38 , and summing up both images , eq .",
    "[ result2 ] goes over to eq .",
    "[ eq : mu_1 ] , as expected .",
    "using eq .",
    "[ chandra_approx ] , and taking both @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the combined magnification of both images simplifies to @xmath41",
    "every source of light on the sky has the potential to be lensed by a retro - macho ( in the same manner that the entire universe is imaged near the horizon of each and every ( unobscured ) black hole ) .",
    "however , given the very slight magnification , only the very brightest of sources , with the most felicitous of alignments , will be observable .",
    "we envisage the retro - macho to sit at one or another distance and ask for its expected luminosity in order to compare it with familiar objects in the sky . in each case",
    "we take the primary source of illumination to be the sun ( output @xmath42 , apparent visual magnitude @xmath43 ) . in table  1 , we show the observed apparent visual magnitudes of these hypothetical solar retro - machos . in addition to perfect alignment ( @xmath31 ) , it is also useful to consider the case of edge alignment ( @xmath44 ) , wherein the observer ",
    "lens line grazes the edge of the source .",
    "because of its large angular size ( as seen from earth ) , the sun offers the best opportunities for close alignment . in eq .",
    "[ result2 ] we find that the sun s @xmath45 angular size dominates over smaller values of @xmath30 for other sources .",
    "a number of other potential sources , in addition to the sun , are worth mentioning .",
    "consider sirius , the next brightest star in the sky .",
    "for a perfectly - aligned retro - macho of @xmath46 , at a distance of @xmath47 , the retro - image of sirius would appear at @xmath48 .",
    "a misalignment of @xmath49 would put its brightness at @xmath50 .",
    "the reg giant betelgeuse would have a brightness of @xmath51 perfectly aligned , and drop to @xmath52 when @xmath53 .",
    "these are to be compared to the sun , which has a retro - image at @xmath54 for perfect alignment . for @xmath53",
    "this drops by only 3 mag , to @xmath48 , showing the advantage of the sun s large angular size .    as the magnification factors in eqs .",
    "[ result1 ] and  [ result3 ] scale as @xmath55 , one might be tempted to consider the supermassive black hole at the galactic center as a retro - macho lens .",
    "the sun , at its closest ( @xmath56 ) alignment with the galactic center black hole , has a retro - image brightness of @xmath57 .",
    "this becomes even fainter when the considerable extinction to the galactic center ( double the usual value , as the photons travel round trip ) is taken into account .",
    "it is to be noted that all of the expressions found in this paper become relevant for black holes at cosmological distances by replacing the physical distances with the appropriate cosmological luminosity distances .",
    "one can imagine imaging the milky way galaxy in the supermassive black hole of a nearby galaxy .",
    "however , even if andromeda had an unobscured central supermassive black hole , the image of the milky way would be dimmer than @xmath58 . in more extreme cases",
    ", we could imagine a supernovae or quasar imaged ( in any frequency band , e.g. radio ) in a distant supermassive black hole . even for perfect alignments ,",
    "such scenarios produce extremely dim images .",
    "a retro - macho would appear somewhat like a conventional macho .",
    "however , rather than magnifying a pre - existing star , a retro - macho causes a `` star '' to appear out of nowhere .",
    "a number of sample retro - macho lightcurves are shown in fig .",
    "[ lightcurves ] .",
    "the colors of a retro - macho are identical to those of the source , and this will provide an important way to confirm the nature of such events",
    ". the structure of a retro - macho will be unresolvable ( much like the multiple images in microlensing are unresolvable ) , as the radius of the ring is on the order of the schwarzschild radius of the lens .",
    "even for very close black holes ( say , at the edge of the solar system ) , the angular extent of a retro - macho image remains less than a milliarcsec .",
    "as in the macho case , the timescale of retro - macho events is determined by the relative motion of the source , lens , and observer .",
    "however , rather than the einstein angle of the lens being the relevant angular scale , in the retrolensing case we are interested in the angular extent of the source measured at the observer .",
    "we define the timescale of an event to be given by the length of time it takes to go from perfect alignment to edge alignment : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the transverse velocity of the observer with respect to the source  lens line - of - sight .",
    "the sun s angular extent is @xmath45 , which means that a solar retro - macho lasts about @xmath61 day , assuming the source  lens motion is stationary as compared to the motion of the earth about the sun . for lens motion at galactic velocities ( @xmath62 ) ,",
    "the timescale for the lens to move an appreciable angle on the sky is considerably longer ( unless the lens is within the solar system ) . for the case of distant stars being retro - lensed by distant black holes ,",
    "however , the timescales can shorten because of the extremely small angles needed for edge alignment .",
    "the retro - image of sirius in a black hole about a parsec away can be expected to last on the order of hours , with the precise value depending on the relative projected velocities .",
    "another point of consideration is the light travel - time of a given retro - macho event . for example , for a solar retro - macho at a distance of a parsec",
    ", the event will appear on the sky corresponding to a position directly opposite to where the sun was located @xmath63 ago ! for a retro - macho to occur within @xmath49 of the current antipodal position of the sun , the black hole must be within about a day s round - trip light travel time , putting the black hole lens at the distance of pluto .",
    "in addition , solar retro - macho events will repeat annually , as the earth returns to the appropriate alignment spot in the ecliptic .",
    "this annual repetition may become one of the most valuable signatures of retro - machos , and can be used both to identify candidates in sky surveys , and to confirm the nature of the events .",
    "from table  1 , it is apparent that retro - machos are exceedingly dim , even in the best of cicumstances .",
    "the most likely observed retro - macho would be our sun imaged in a nearby stellar - mass black hole .",
    "simple theoretical estimates give a value for the local number density of stellar - mass black holes of @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "based on the microlensing event rates towards the galactic bulge of the macho and ogle teams , we find @xmath65  @xcite .",
    "both these rates include black holes in the mass range @xmath66 .",
    "although it is unlikely for there to be a stellar - mass black hole within a parsec , it is reasonable to expect one within @xmath67 of the sun .",
    "such a black hole , if perfectly aligned with the sun ( i.e. in the ecliptic plane ) , would produce a @xmath68 retro - image of the sun . even at a distance of @xmath69",
    ", the image only brightens to @xmath70 .",
    "the earliest population of stars are thought to have masses in the 3001,000@xmath71 range , and probably collapse to form black holes in a similar mass range ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the retro - machos from these holes would be visible at @xmath72 to a distance of over a parsec .",
    "it is apparent , however , that even in the best of circumstances only a chance encounter with an unusually nearby or massive black hole will lead to an observable retro - macho .",
    "microlensing surveys have produced a number of candidate black hole lenses .",
    "these arise from long - timescale events , where the parallax effect of the earth s revolution about the sun is strong enough to break some of the degeneracies in the microlensing fits .",
    "for example , the best fit to macho galactic bulge event 96-blg-5 is a black hole of mass @xmath73 at a distance of @xmath74  ( bennett et al .",
    "2001 ; see also agol et al .",
    "although this is too distant to be observed , it is conceivable that a future microlensing event may provide us with a definite retrolensing candidate . in these cases we know exactly where and when to look , and what to expect .",
    "although the likelihood is small , a close approach of a stellar - mass black hole would have a potentially catastrophic impact on our solar system ( both through disruption of the oort cloud , and through direct effects on the orbital stability of the planets ) . retrolensing offers perhaps the only _ direct _ observational signature of such an incoming `` rogue '' black hole .",
    "the sun can be considered a searchlight , sweeping out a @xmath45-wide swath of the sky centered on the ecliptic plane in search for black holes . for a magnitude limit of @xmath2",
    ", this reveals all black holes of mass @xmath1 or greater out to a limiting distance of @xmath3{10^{(\\bar{m}-30)/2.5}\\,(m/10\\,m_\\sun)^{2}}$ ] . through repeated ,",
    "deep observations of the direction anti - podal to the sun , retrolensing can be utilized to construct a black hole early warning system . )",
    "laser can be used to _ actively _",
    "probe for retro - machos .",
    "one could scan the entire sky systematically , and monitor for returning glints of light ( in the same frequency band as that of the laser , and with time delays a direct measure of distance to the black holes ) .",
    "this would constitute a true black hole early warning system . ]",
    "consider nemesis , a hypothetical solar companion  @xcite . if we take nemesis to be a @xmath46 black hole at the outer edge of the oort cloud ( @xmath75 ) , and lying near the ecliptic , it would be directly imaged as a retro - macho at @xmath76 .",
    "however , such a nemesis _ would _ be revealed ( @xmath77 ) if it approached to a distance of @xmath78 .",
    "it is to be noted that microlensing , although quite proficient at detecting compact objects in the direction of the galactic bulge at distances of kiloparsecs , is not particularly efficient at detecting nearby black holes .",
    "the einstein angle of a point mass lens is given by @xmath79 , which for distant stars lensed by nearby masses simplifies to @xmath80 .",
    "for a black hole at @xmath81 , a star would have to be aligned to within @xmath82 to be microlensed . for a solar retro - macho ,",
    "on the other hand , edge - alignment is automatically satisfied for any black hole lying within @xmath83 of the ecliptic .",
    "retrolensing is thus better than microlensing for detecting approaching nearby black holes .",
    "we are entering an age where the entire sky can be expected to be imaged deeply , and all transient objects noted  @xcite . within any such large , repetitive sample , a retro - macho would look like a macho event with zero baseline flux ( i.e. no background star ) . upon detecting such an event",
    ", one would try to identify a possible light source at the diametrically opposite position on the sky ( `` through '' the earth ) .",
    "does the source have identical colors to the transient image ?",
    "if so , retro - macho ! for example , in the case of the sun , we would look for images with precisely solar spectra .",
    "it may be of interest to perform a thorough search of extant microlensing survey databases for events that do not correspond to amplification of background stars . presuming a non - detection of such events , and taking the depth of current surveys to be @xmath84",
    ", we can directly rule out unobscured black holes with mass greater than @xmath85 in the direction of the galactic bulge ( @xmath86 ) at distances less than @xmath87 .",
    "these distance limits improve dramatically with deeper surveys .    should a retro - macho ever be observed",
    ", it would afford an unprecedented opportunity to study the strong - field aspects of general relativity .",
    "these objects probe very near the horizon of the holes  in the perfect alignment case , the image represents photons that have passed within @xmath88 of the singularity ( where @xmath89 is the schwarzschild radius ) , as deep into the strong field regime as we are ever likely to probe via light .",
    "a retro - macho observation would be an impressive confirmation of the theory of general relativity , and would leave little doubt as to the existence of einstein black holes .",
