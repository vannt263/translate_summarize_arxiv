    "symmetry occupies a central and indispensable role in physics . amongst others , it is the key concept behind the theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "most of the known phase transitions break one or more symmetries .",
    "when symmetry breaking occurs , the mean value of a quantity which is not invariant under the symmetry group of the theory becomes `` spontaneously '' non - zero in the broken symmetry phase .",
    "such a quantity is called the _",
    "order parameter_. as well appreciated , the dimension @xmath0 of the system and the symmetries of the order parameter characterize different universality classes and play a pivotal role in determining whether a particular phase transition may or may not exist .",
    "in particular , zero or one dimensional theories with short range interactions can not exhibit a phase transition at any finite temperature .",
    "additionally , the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite states that a continuous symmetry can not be spontaneously broken at any finite temperature for two - dimensional theories with finite range interactions . on the other hand , elitzur @xcite demonstrated that a spontaneous breaking of a _ local _ symmetry is not possible .",
    "below , we will show that elitzur s theorem is a consequence of a reduction to zero of the effective dimension of the gauge invariant theory .",
    "moreover , we will show that from the point of view of the non - invariant gauge fields , the presence of a `` @xmath1-dimensional gauge symmetry '' ( see definition below ) reduces the effective dimension of the theory from @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "the dimension @xmath1 is intermediate between local gauge systems ( @xmath2 ) and global gauge symmetries ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "how is it possible that symmetry not only determines the nature of the transition but also its effective dimension ?",
    "the answer to this question requires a definition of what we mean by _ local _ and `` @xmath1-dimensional gauge symmetries '' .",
    "a local gauge symmetry has its roots in a group of operations which leave the theory invariant and in which the minimum non - empty set of fields influenced by any of these operations occupies a finite spatial region .",
    "a `` @xmath1-dimensional gauge symmetry '' is any symmetry operation which leaves the hamiltonian ( or action ) invariant such that the minimum non - empty set of fields which are changed under the symmetry operation occupies a @xmath1-dimensional region . in accord with this definition",
    ", a local gauge symmetry corresponds to the particular case @xmath2 .",
    "the above question is motivated by the recent interest in a considerable number of theories that are invariant under a @xmath1-dimensional gauge group with dimension @xmath4 @xcite . as was already noticed @xcite ,",
    "some aspects of these theories indicate that the dimension is effectively reduced . in this paper",
    "we formalize this notion by proving a generalized elitzur s theorem for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "we will prove that the mean value of a local quantity which is non - invariant under a @xmath1-dimensional gauge group can be bounded by another mean value of the same quantity which is computed for an effective @xmath1-dimensional theory .",
    "the gauge transformations become a global symmetry of the effective theory and the range of the interactions in the original theory is preserved .",
    "this proof formalizes the idea of `` dimensional reduction '' and gives rise to four important corollaries .",
    "the first corollary is elitzur s theorem .",
    "the second states that a @xmath5 gauge symmetry can not be broken at any finite temperature if the the theory only includes finite range interactions .",
    "the third corollary is a natural consequence of the mermin - wagner theorem : a _ continuous _",
    "@xmath6 gauge symmetry can not be broken at any finite temperature if the interactions are of finite range .",
    "the fourth corollary extends elitzur s theorem to certain systems in which at least an _",
    "emergent _ low energy gauge - like symmetry appears . by emergent symmetry",
    "we mean a group transformations which become a symmetry of the hamiltonian only within its lowest - energy subspace @xcite .",
    "recently , theories containing @xmath1-dimensional gauge symmetries with @xmath4 became the focus of attention in different areas of physics .",
    "the kugel - khomskii model that describes the interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in transition metals as well as orbital only variants embodying the jahn - teller interactions often display @xmath7 gauge - like symmetries @xcite .",
    "the well known planar orbital compass model @xcite is invariant under a @xmath5 @xmath8-gauge group .",
    "the two - dimensional frustrated ising magnet studied by xu and moore @xcite provides another example of a @xmath5 @xmath8-gauge invariant theory .",
    "there are also examples of frustrated magnets @xcite for which the @xmath5 @xmath8-gauge group is an _ emergent symmetry _ @xcite . here",
    ", the dimensional reduction may occur at low energies .",
    "similar symmetries appear in ring exchange bose metals @xcite , quantum hall liquid crystalline phases @xcite , @xcite , lipid bilayers with intercalated dna strands @xcite , and `` sliding luttinger liquids '' @xcite .",
    "the physical roots of our theorem and its corollaries are precisely the same fluctuations which generically inhibit order in low dimensions .",
    "just as domain wall entropy eradicates any viable order in one dimensional systems having short range interactions , domain walls on different sliding phases of many of the above examples inhibit discrete d=1 gauge symmetry breaking at any finite temperature.similar considerations apply to continuous d= 1,2 dimensional gauge symmetry systems whose order is destroyed by low energy excitations .",
    "we will start by considering the case of classical theories . as we will see later",
    ", the generalization to the quantum case is very simple . before enunciating our theorem",
    "it is convenient to give a more precise formal definition of a @xmath1-dimensional gauge group . from now on we will consider theories which are defined on a lattice @xmath9 .",
