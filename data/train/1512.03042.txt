    "such an anomalous current has been predicted in a variety of topologically trivial systems , mainly due to an interplay between spin - orbit coupling and a zeeman field applied to the junction area ,  @xcite but also in hybrid structures with noncoplanar ferromagnets  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "for a recent review ) . in the former case , the anomalous current results from a magnetoelectric coupling  @xcite between the electric field responsible for the rashba soc and the zeeman field .",
    "the rashba soc separates the spectrum into two helical bands , and the effect is typically small because of the competition between them .",

    "we find that , in a short junction , similarly to the qshi system ,  @xcite the dominant contribution to the aje comes from the superconducting parts and increases very strongly when those parts are tuned into the topologically nontrivial phase . in particular , in that regime , the anomalous current @xmath0 can become comparable to the critical current @xmath1 .",
