    "bose - einstein condensates are ideal artificial systems for quantum manipulation .",
    "the spinor condensates have very rich spin structures , and their swift response to the external field is notable @xcite .",
    "usually , a condensate would contain more than @xmath2 atoms .",
    "due to the progress in techniques , much smaller condensates ( say , particle number @xmath0 ) could be produced .",
    "note that the strength of the effective interaction between the particles @xmath3 is proportional to the average particle density , which is proportional to @xmath4 ( evaluated based on the thomas - fermi approximation ) .",
    "thus the particles are subjected to a stronger interaction in smaller systems .",
    "in fact , in the study of spin - dynamics , the rate of evolution depends on @xmath5 rather than @xmath6 @xcite , where @xmath6 is the time . therefore , the evolution will be swifter in the smaller systems",
    ". thus they might be even more suitable for manipulation . in principle",
    ", these systems could be more precisely prepared ( such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the total magnetization , could be more rigorously given ) .",
    "therefore , some properties not contained in large condensates might emerge ( say , if @xmath9 , whether @xmath7 is even or odd might be serious ) , and some properties might depend on the external field very sensitively in some particular cases ( as shown below ) .    there are already a number of literatures dedicated to the large condensates of spin-1 atoms .",
    "the commonly used theoretical tool is the mean field theory ( mft ) @xcite .",
    "the ground states with the ferromagnetic phase and polar phase are found .",
    "their modes of excitation and their dynamical behavior have been studied , and very rich physical phenomena have been found ( say , the formation of spin - domains and spin - vortices ) . on the other hand , for small condensates ,",
    "a theory goes beyond the mft might be more appropriate . in this paper ,",
    "the spin - structures of spin-1 small condensates under a magnetic field @xmath1 are studied by using a many - body theory in which the parentage coefficients of spin - states are used as a tool @xcite .",
    "the variation of @xmath1 is considered as adiabatic and the discussion is limited to static behavior .",
    "one - body and two - body spin correlative probabilities are defined and calculated .",
    "they are used to extract information from the spin eigenstates.@xcite furthermore , the correlation coefficients are defined and calculated to measure quantitatively the spin correlation , and the fidelity susceptibilities are also calculated to measure quantitatively the sensitivity of the ground states against the change of @xmath1 .",
    "thereby a detailed and deeper description on spin - spin correlation has been obtained that might lead to a better understanding on spin structures . in particular , the spin probabilities defined in this paper are observables , they might serve as a bridge to relate theories and experiments , therefore can be used to clarify various spin - structures and interactions .",
    "the emphasis is placed on the response of the condensates to @xmath1",
    ". the related knowledge might be useful for quantum manipulation .",
    "both the cases with the temperature @xmath10 zero and nonzero are considered .",
    "let @xmath7 spin-1 atoms be confined by an isotropic and parabolic trap with frequency @xmath11 .",
    "the interaction is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are , respectively , the position vector and the spin operator of the @xmath15-th particle . a magnetic field @xmath1 lying along the @xmath16-axis is applied .",
    "we consider the case that the size of the condensate is small so that it is smaller than the spin healing length . in this case",
    ", the single mode approximation ( sma ) is applicable.@xcite under the sma all particles will have the same spatial wave function @xmath17 . after the integration over the spatial degrees of freedom , we arrive at a model hamiltonian @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total spin operator of the @xmath7 particles , @xmath20-component of @xmath14 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 the bohr magneton and @xmath24 the hyperfine splitting energy .",
    "the last two terms of @xmath25 are the linear and quadratic zeeman energies , respectively .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath25 will have @xmath26 and its @xmath27-component @xmath8 ( namely , the magnetization , @xmath28 is assumed ) conserved when the quadratic term is neglected .",
    "therefore they can be denoted as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , to @xmath32 or @xmath33 .",
    "it has been proved that @xmath34 is unique without further degeneracy @xcite .",
    "they together form a complete set for all the totally symmetric spin - states of @xmath35 systems . when the quadratic term is taken into account",
    ", @xmath8 will remain to be conserved , but @xmath26 will not . in this case",
    "@xmath34 can be used as basis functions for the diagonalization of @xmath25 . in this approach , a powerful tool , the fractional parentage coefficients , that we have developed",
    "previously is used for the calculation of related matrix elements @xcite .    using these coefficients ,",
    "a particle ( say , the particle @xmath32 ) can be extracted from @xmath34 as @xmath36 ,   \\label{e02_varthetasm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the spin - state of the particle @xmath32 in component @xmath38 or @xmath39 .",

    "once a particle has been extracted , the calculation of the matrix elements is straight forward , and we have @xmath41         + qq_{s's}^{nm } \\ } ,   \\label{e05_vsm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42      + \\delta_{s',s-2 }       a_{s-2,m\\mu}^{\\{n\\ } }       b_{sm\\mu}^{\\{n\\ } } \\nonumber \\\\    & & + \\delta_{s',s+2 }       a_{sm\\mu}^{\\{n\\ } }       b_{s+2,m\\mu}^{\\{n\\}}\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for an arbitrary @xmath7 , after a procedure of diagonalization , the set of eigenenergies @xmath43 and the corresponding eigenstates @xmath44 can be obtained , where @xmath43 is in the order of increasing energy .",
    "since the set @xmath34 is complete , the set @xmath45 is exact for @xmath25 .",
    "for the condensates with nonzero spins , it has been shown theoretically that there are various spin - structures . in order to confirm these structures experimentally",
    ", one has to define some measurable physical quantities . for the spatial degrees of freedom",
    ", it is reminded that the one - body density @xmath46 can provide information on the spatial distribution of the particles , and the two - body density @xmath47 can describe the spatial correlation .",
    "similar quantities can be defined in the spin space .",
    "each spin eigenstate can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath49 can be obtained via .",
    "the normality @xmath50 implies that @xmath51-component .",
    "then , we define the one - body probability @xmath52 note that @xmath53 is just the average population of the @xmath54-component , and is an observable which can be directly measured via the stern - gerlach technique .    in the case with @xmath55 , @xmath26 is a good quantum number , and the @xmath15-th state has @xmath56 ( if @xmath57 ) , or @xmath58 ( if @xmath59).@xcite in this case , @xmath60 , and we have @xmath61 when one more particle is extracted from the right side of , we have @xmath62 where @xmath63 or @xmath64 otherwise .",
    "then the @xmath15-th state can be rewritten as @xmath65 from the normality as before , we have @xmath66 .",
    "thus , it is straight forward to define the 2-body spin correlative probability as @xmath67 @xmath68 is the probability that the spin of a particle is in @xmath54 while another in @xmath69 when the two are observed , obviously , @xmath70 .",
    "if more particles are extracted , higher order spin correlative probabilities could also be similarly defined .",
    "these probabilities do not have a counterpart in the mft , therefore additional information might be provided by them .",
    "incidentally , the technique for the measurement of the correlative probabilities is mature in particle physics and nuclear physics , but not in condensed matter physics .",
    "the development of related technique is desired .    in general",
    ", one can define the correlation coefficient @xmath71 to measure quantitatively how large the correlation is .",
    "if @xmath72 deviates remarkably from @xmath32 , the correlation is strong . whereas if @xmath73 , the correlation is weak , and the system can be well understood simply from the 1-body probabilities .",
    "numerical examples will be given below .",
    "@xmath74 and @xmath75 are used as units for energy and length , respectively , where @xmath76 is the mass of atom . the spatial wave function @xmath17 is obtained under the thomas - fermi approximation , and",
    "thereby we have the strength @xmath77 .",
    "since a slight inaccuracy that may exist in @xmath17 would cause only a slight deviation in the magnitude of @xmath3 , the approximation is acceptable in the qualitative sense .",
    "@xmath78 ( in @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 are in general assumed ( unless particularly specified ) . @xmath81rb and @xmath82na condensates will be used as examples for the @xmath57 and @xmath59 species , respectively . in the units adopted , we have @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath81rb , and @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath82na .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath25 is straight forward when all the parameters are given .",
    "then , the coefficients @xmath87 can be known . from equations  , and , the 1-body and 2-body probabilities can be obtained .",
    "the condensate will fall into its ground state @xmath88 with a specified @xmath8 when @xmath89 .",
    "@xmath8 is determined by how the species is prepared . the case with @xmath90 will be considered later .      to evaluate how strong the correlation in @xmath88 would be ,",
    "the correlation coefficients @xmath91 of rb against @xmath1 are shown in ( a ) .",
    "the magnitudes of all the curves are extremely close to one in ( a ) .",
    "this is also true for @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "it implies that the correlation in @xmath88 is very weak .",
    "when @xmath55 , @xmath88 will have @xmath30.@xcite its expression does not depend on the details of interaction but only on the sign of @xmath94 , and can be uniquely written as @xmath95 where @xmath96 implies that the spins of @xmath97 and @xmath98 are coupled to spin @xmath99 , and so on .",
    "the special way of spin coupling in ( i.e. , the combined spin of an arbitrary group of @xmath100 particles is @xmath100 ) assure that the state is normalized and symmetrized . where all the spins are roughly aligned along a common direction , but the azimuthal angle of this direction is arbitrary .    from the analytical forms of @xmath101 can be derived as @xmath102 can be approximately rewritten as @xmath103 .",
    "thus , if @xmath104 , half of the particles would have @xmath38 . if @xmath105 , the increase of @xmath8 would lead to a decrease of @xmath106 .",
    "in particular , @xmath107 when @xmath108 as expected .",
    "incidentally , the above analytical forms of @xmath101 are identical to those from the mft when @xmath109.@xcite    when @xmath1 varies , the one - body probabilities @xmath101 of @xmath88 against @xmath1 are calculated and shown in .",
    "the left ends of the curves coincide exactly with those from the above analytical expressions .",
    "note that the @xmath110 particles will gain additional energy from the quadratic zeeman term . in order to reduce the energy",
    "the number of @xmath38 particles will increase with @xmath1 .",
    "this is clearly shown in . for @xmath104 as shown in a , the derivative of @xmath111 varies very swift from a positive value to zero at the vicinity of a turning point @xmath112 where @xmath113 , i , e , the number of @xmath38 particles @xmath114 is very close to its limit @xmath7 .",
    "the swift variation at the turning point will become a sudden transition when @xmath7 is large , and the point becomes a critical point @xmath115 . passing through this point , the derivative varies abruptly , but the spin - state @xmath116 itself varies continuously . when @xmath117 , the ground state remains unchanged as @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a fock - state with @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 particles in @xmath123 , 0 , and -1 , respectively .    when @xmath105 , not all the particles can be changed to @xmath38 because of the conservation of @xmath8 .",
    "accordingly , the increase of @xmath106 is hindered and the curves in b are smoother . when @xmath8 is large , the curves are very flat implying that @xmath88 is affected by @xmath1 very weakly .",
    "when @xmath124 , we found that @xmath125 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 . in this way , @xmath129 is maximized so that the quadratic zeeman energy is minimized .    in conclusion of this section for small condensates of rb ,",
    "the ground state @xmath130 is continuously changed from @xmath131 to @xmath132 without a transition when @xmath1 increases . however , the derivative @xmath133 undergoes a transition at @xmath115 when @xmath104 .",
    "it is recalled that the mft , which is correct when @xmath7 is very large , has predicted the transitions between the ferromagnetic , broken - axisymmetry , and the polar phases @xcite .",
    "the broken - axisymmetry phase is caused by a rapid quenched field , therefore it is not expected to appear in our case with @xmath1 varying adiabatically ..      contrary to the previous case , the spin correlation is very strong in the ground states @xmath130 of @xmath59 condensates as shown by @xmath91 in b , where the left ends of all the curves are remarkably larger than @xmath32 .",
    "it implies that , when two particles are observed , the probability of a particle in @xmath38 would be much larger if the other one has @xmath134 .",
    "starting from @xmath55 there is a domain of @xmath1 where @xmath91 remains large and nearly unchanged ( refer to the @xmath135 curve in b ) . outside the domain ,",
    "the correlation vanish rapidly .",
    "the domain is called a strong correlation domain ( scd ) , where the spin - structure at @xmath55 will keep unchanged against the increase of @xmath1 .",
    "the scd does not have a clear border .",
    "for each curve in b , let @xmath136 be the value where @xmath137/2 $ ] .",
    "then , @xmath136 is considered as the outward border of the scd . a larger @xmath8 will lead to a larger @xmath136 ( say , for b , if @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 , respectively , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 ) .",
    "thus the spin structure at @xmath55 will better keep when @xmath8 is large .",
    "when @xmath55 , the ground state will have @xmath26 as small as possible.@xcite thus , @xmath144 if @xmath145 is even , or @xmath146 if @xmath145 is odd . due to the fact that @xmath147 is unique , we have @xmath148^{(n - m)/2 } \\ } ,   \\label{e20_theta1m}\\ ] ] where @xmath149 is the symmetrizer , i.e. , a summation over the @xmath150 particle permutations .",
    "so this state is composed of a group of @xmath123 particles together with a group of singlet pairs . and @xmath151^{(n - m-1)/2 } \\ } ,   \\label{e20_varthetam1mn}\\ ] ] which is composed of a group of @xmath152 polarized particles ( but the direction of polarization deviates a little from the z - axis ) together with a group of singlet pairs . from the one - body probabilities are @xmath153    for the case @xmath104 and @xmath7 being even , @xmath154^{n/2}$ ] .",
    "this state is named the polar state where all the particles are in the singlet pairs . from equations .   and",
    ", the polar state has @xmath155 for all @xmath54 .",
    "in other words , the particles are equally populated among the three components .",
    "this is a common property of @xmath156 states .",
    "when @xmath1 increases , @xmath101 against @xmath1 are shown in .",
    "since the ground state will have more and more @xmath38 particles , @xmath111 increases sharply from @xmath157 to @xmath158 as shown in a. correspondingly , the ground state @xmath159 is sharply transformed from @xmath160 to @xmath161 . comparing the curve of @xmath111 in a with",
    "the one in a for rb , the rise of the former is much faster than the latter .",
    "thus the na condensate is highly sensitive to the appearance of @xmath1 if @xmath104 .",
    "a very weak field ( a few @xmath162 ) is sufficient to break nearly all the pairs and turn every spin lying on the @xmath163-@xmath164 plane independently .",
    "the independence is supported by the curve of @xmath165 in b , where @xmath166 except @xmath1 is close to zero .",
    "however , the high  sensitivity will be lost when @xmath167 .    in b",
    "the curve of @xmath168 remains to be horizontal when @xmath169 ( refer also to the curve with @xmath135 in b ) .",
    "thus the spin - structure inside the scd might remain unchanged .",
    "to clarify , the 2-body probabilities are calculated and shown in , where all the @xmath170 remain unchanged in the scd .",
    "thus the invariance of the structure against @xmath1 is strongly supported .",
    "the invariance can also be seen by observing the overlap @xmath171 against @xmath1 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 are assumed to be even , a superscript @xmath1 is added to emphasize the dependence on @xmath1 ) . with the parameters of and with @xmath135 ,",
    "this overlap is @xmath172 when @xmath173 . thus the invariance is directly confirmed .",
    "however , it decreases very fast when @xmath1 is close to @xmath136 , and is equal to @xmath174 when @xmath175 .",
    "afterward , it tends to zero rapidly when @xmath1 is further larger .",
    "the existence of the scd demonstrates that the mixture of a group of singlet pairs together with a group of @xmath8 unpaired particles ( each has @xmath176 ) is capable to keep its structure against @xmath1 .",
    "however , the capability will be lost when @xmath1 is close to or @xmath177 . afterward",
    "the mixture will begin to change .",
    "note that the change is characterized by the increasing of @xmath38 particles , which come from the breaking of pairs .",
    "therefore the change would be less probable if the original number of pairs is small .",
    "thus a larger @xmath8 ( implying a fewer original pairs ) will lead to a better stability and therefore a larger @xmath136 .",
    "a larger @xmath94 will also lead to a better stability and therefore a larger @xmath136 ( say , if @xmath94 is one time larger than the experimental value of @xmath178 , then the @xmath136 would be enlarged from @xmath142 to @xmath179 for the curve with @xmath135 in b ) .    since @xmath8 affects the stability , @xmath101 is in general sensitive to @xmath8",
    ". if @xmath1 is weak , the sensitivity would be very high when @xmath8 is small .",
    "e.g. , it is shown in b that @xmath106 will decrease dramatically at @xmath180 when @xmath181 is simply changed from @xmath33 to @xmath182 .    when @xmath124 , all the pairs will be destroyed and @xmath130 will tend to @xmath132 .",
    "thus , disregarding @xmath183 or @xmath184 , both species tend to the same structure .      in order to understand the sensitivity of the ground states @xmath185 against @xmath1 quantitatively , the fidelity susceptibility @xcite .",
    "@xmath186 is calculated and given in .",
    "this figure demonstrates that each species has its own region highly sensitive to @xmath1 . for rb",
    ", the most sensitive region is surrounding the critical point @xmath115 where the increase of @xmath114 stops suddenly ( refer to a ) . when @xmath1 is small , the sensitivity does not depend on @xmath8 and is in general very weak .",
    "whereas for na , the most sensitive region is surrounding the border of scd , @xmath136 , where @xmath114 begin to increase suddenly ( refer to b ) .  the fact that @xmath136 will become larger with @xmath8",
    "is clearly shown in b. the sensitivity can be very high when @xmath1 is small if @xmath8 is also small .",
    "since the linear zeeman term does not affect the spin - structures , the ratio @xmath187 involved in @xmath25 is crucial .",
    "this quantity is proportional to @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , a larger @xmath11 would reduce the effect of @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , for @xmath189 , all the curves plotted in to will extend horizontally to the right by a common factor @xmath190 .",
    "in particular , the scd will become larger ( say , @xmath136 of the ground states @xmath191 of na would increase from @xmath142 to @xmath192 if @xmath11 is from @xmath193 to @xmath194 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the change of @xmath7 causes not simply a change of scale , because the numbers of degrees of freedom are thereby changed . for an example , if @xmath80 , @xmath139 , and @xmath195 , @xmath111 of rb would be @xmath196 when @xmath197 , @xmath198 , and @xmath199 , respectively .",
    "thus , the curve of @xmath111 in a would rise up faster if @xmath7 decreases from 1000 . on the contrary ,",
    "if @xmath80 , @xmath139 , and @xmath195 , @xmath111 of na would be @xmath200 when @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 , respectively .",
    "thus , the curve of @xmath111 in a would rise up slower if @xmath7 decreases from 1000 .",
    "thus , the effect of @xmath7 on @xmath57 and @xmath184 species is different .",
    "the effect of @xmath7 on @xmath106 with @xmath105 is shown in .",
    "the curve with @xmath80 in a is identical to the curve with @xmath135 in b for @xmath57 . in a for rb the curves with a smaller @xmath7 will rise up faster against @xmath1 just as the previous case with @xmath104 . for @xmath59 ,",
    "the curve with @xmath80 in b is identical to the curve with @xmath135 in b. similar to the case with @xmath104 , a smaller @xmath7 will cause also a smoother change . in particular , the abrupt change appearing in the vicinity of @xmath136 as shown in b will disappear when @xmath7 is small .",
    "since the level density in a condensate is usually dense , thermo - fluctuation is in general not negligible .",
    "what actually measured is the weighted probabilities @xmath204 and @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the weight , @xmath43 the energy , @xmath10 the temperature , and the summation in principle runs over all the states . however , when @xmath207 , the contribution arises essentially from the ground band , and all the higher states can be neglected.@xcite the members of the ground band have nearly the same spatial wave functions , and their spin - states together with @xmath43 can be obtained via the diagonalization of @xmath25 .",
    "as an example , @xmath208 of the condensates with @xmath57 at @xmath209 is plotted in a. in order to see the effect of interaction , @xmath94 is given at three values .",
    "when @xmath1 is very small ( @xmath210 ) or sufficiently large ( @xmath211 ) , the three curves associated with different values of @xmath94 overlap nearly .",
    "however , in between , they are rather sensitive to @xmath212 as shown in a .. to see clearer , both @xmath208 and @xmath213 against @xmath94 under @xmath214 are plotted in b. the figure demonstrates that the weighted 2-body probabilities are very sensitive to @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , the patterns of the curves can be tuned by altering @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the weighted probabilities under various @xmath1 can provide rich information on the parameters of interaction .",
    "one more example for the case @xmath59 is shown in .",
    "similar to the previous case , high sensitivity to the interaction is found . in a ,",
    "the left ends of the curves are flat .",
    "this is caused by the existence of the scd , where the spin - structure remains nearly unchanged .",
    "we have studied the spin structures of small spin-1 condensates ( @xmath0 ) under a magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "the theory is beyond the mft , and the single mode approximation has been adopted .",
    "the fractional parentage coefficients have been used as a tool for the analytical derivation .",
    "the 1-body , 2-body , and weighted probabilities are defined and calculated to extract information from the spin eigenstates .",
    "the correlation coefficients @xmath215 and the fidelity susceptibility @xmath216 have also been calculated .",
    "the following results are mentioned ( @xmath145 is assumed to be even for simplicity ) .",
    "\\(i ) when @xmath55 , the ground state @xmath130 is either the ferromagnetic state @xmath131 if @xmath57 , or is the polar state @xmath217 if @xmath59 . for @xmath131 ,",
    "all the @xmath7 spins are coupled to total spin @xmath30 , @xmath218 is close to 1 and @xmath219 is very small ( and ) , therefore the ferromagnetic state does not have spin - correlation , and is inert to @xmath1 when @xmath1 is small .",
    "the state @xmath217 has @xmath8 particles in @xmath220 together with @xmath221 singlet pairs , its @xmath91 is very large .",
    "thus the polar state contains strong spin - correlation .",
    "furthermore , its @xmath222 is very large when @xmath8 is small .",
