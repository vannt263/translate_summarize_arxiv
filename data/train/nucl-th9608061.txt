    "virtual compton scattering ( vcs ) off the proton , as tested in , e.g. , the reaction @xmath0 , has recently attracted considerable interest @xcite .",
    "several experiments have been proposed @xcite , utilizing the opportunities which a virtual spacelike photon offers , namely , an additional longitudinal polarization degree of freedom and the fact that energy and momentum transfer of the virtual photon can be varied independently . at the same time , in comparison with real compton scattering , the extraction of new experimental information will be more difficult since the process @xmath0 contains an interference between vcs and the bethe - heitler contribution , describing radiation off the electron . on the theoretical side , the low - energy theorem ( let ) of low @xcite and gell - mann and goldberger @xcite has lately been extended to include virtual photons as well @xcite .",
    "the structure - dependent part beyond the let was analyzed in @xcite in terms of a multipole expansion . keeping only terms linear in the energy of the final real photon ,",
    "the model - dependent amplitude was parametrized in terms of ten `` generalized polarizabilities '' , and these polarizabilities were evaluated in the framework of a nonrelativistic quark model @xcite .",
    "predictions for the spin - averaged polarizabilities @xmath1 and @xmath2 were obtained by several authors within various frameworks , such as an effective lagrangian including resonances and @xmath3-channel exchanges @xcite , the linear @xmath4 model @xcite , and the heavy - baryon formulation of chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "an alternative low - energy expansion for virtual compton scattering off a spin - zero target , and thus implicitly also for the spin - averaged part of the nucleon vcs amplitude , has been obtained in @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "an interesting observation was made : within the framework of the linear @xmath4 model only two of the three scalar generalized polarizabilities introduced in @xcite were found to be independent . in the following ,",
    "we will reinvestigate the spin - independent part of the vcs amplitude and demonstrate that the findings of @xcite can be proven to be a general consequence of charge - conjugation symmetry combined with crossing symmetry .",
    "unless charge - conjugation invariance is violated , there are only two independent scalar generalized polarizabilities .",
    "furthermore , we illustrate how the standard limit of real compton scattering is naturally obtained , if the expansion in the final - photon energy is not truncated at first order .",
    "finally , the low - energy expansion of @xcite and its application in the framework of a heavy - baryon calculation @xcite are connected to this work .",
    "for the purpose of simplicity , we consider the vcs amplitude for a spinless target , e.g. , a positively charged pion : @xmath5 . in the following discussion , we will thus always refer to the pion , but the general results also apply to the spin - averaged amplitude of vcs off the proton @xcite , which is , of course , the reaction of current experimental and theoretical interest @xcite .    using the conventions of bjorken and drell @xcite",
    ", the invariant amplitude may be written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote `` polarization vectors '' of the initial and final photon , respectively , @xmath9 is the elementary charge ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath11 is the mass of the target , here the pion . according to @xcite , the normalization of the respective invariant amplitude @xmath12 differs by a factor of @xmath13 between the pion and proton case . when considering vcs off the proton , one therefore has to omit this factor in eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) in order to obtain the same normalization of the compton tensor @xmath14 as for the pion case . in this section",
    "we still allow both photons to be virtual , and only in the following section we will restrict ourselves to the application we are interested in , namely , @xmath15 .",
    "we split the total vcs tensor into two parts @xmath16 and @xmath17 @xcite , where class @xmath16 contains the pole terms , possibly together with some appropriate piece to ensure gauge invariance , and class @xmath17 contains the rest , @xmath18 we assume that the division into @xmath16 and @xmath17 was done in such a fashion that all symmetry principles are individually satisfied by @xmath19 and @xmath20 . with the above separation , @xmath20 is by construction regular as @xmath21 or @xmath22 . in fact",
