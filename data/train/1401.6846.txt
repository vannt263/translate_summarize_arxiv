    "channel state information at the transmitter ( csit ) is essential for achieving high spectral efficiency in wireless systems .",
    "ideally , csit should be known before the transmission has started , as in that case the transmitter can optimize the parameters of the transmission , such as the power used or the precoding that is applied in case of multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) transmission . in frequency division duplex ( fdd )",
    "systems , provision of csit necessarily happens through a feedback from the receiver . on the other hand , time division duplex ( tdd ) systems can utilize channel reciprocity and the transmitter can obtain csit by measuring a signal received in the opposite direction .",
    "reciprocity loses its utility when there is interference .",
    "consider the scenario on fig .",
    "[ fig : atobinterfc ] , where @xmath1 is the transmitter , @xmath2 is the receiver and @xmath3 is an interferer that affects @xmath2 . by assuming that @xmath1 knows the noise power at @xmath2 , channel reciprocity enables @xmath1 to estimate the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , denoted @xmath4 ,",
    "at which @xmath2 receives the signal of @xmath1 .",
    "when the interferer @xmath3 is active , the quantity that is relevant for the transmitter is the signal - to - interference - and - noise ratio ( sinr ) and @xmath1 has no way of knowing it unless @xmath2 explicitly reports either the interference - to - noise ratio ( inr ) @xmath5 or the actual sinr .",
    "hence , the notion of csit is broader and incorporates knowledge about the exact conditions at which the signal has been received , including the interference . in many practical scenarios ,",
    "the interference is intermittent and @xmath2 can not know whether / which interferer will be active when the actual transmission of @xmath1 takes place .",
    "furthermore , even if there is no interference and the channel is tdd , there could not have been a reliable way to measure the snr @xmath4 before the transmission , for example due to the scheduling structure in the system or fast channel dynamics . on the other hand , _ after _",
    "@xmath1 has completed its transmission , @xmath2 can send feedback to @xmath1 about what the actual received snr or sinr had been during that transmission .",
    "we refer to this as a _",
    "posterior csit _ or _ delayed csit _ , as opposed to _ prior csit _ , known before the actual transmission .     before the transmission from @xmath1 takes place use to intermittent interference from @xmath3 . ]",
    "the performance of the communication link that operates with posterior csit is certainly inferior compared to the link that operates with prior csit , as there are certain parameters that can not be optimally adapted if csit is not known before the transmission .",
    "if csit is not available before the transmission , then the power that @xmath1 uses for transmission can not follow the water filling principle and thus leads to _ irrecoverable loss _ , since at the time of getting csit , the power has already been used . in other words , if the channel gain is below the threshold , then the power is irreversibly lost to a bad channel state .",
    "similarly , the lack of prior csit in mimo transmission prevents the sender to have optimal spatial focusing and power is irreversibly lost in spatial dimensions that are not optimal . as the last example , _ multiuser diversity _ is not recoverable when the posterior csit is available , because prior csit is used to select the user with the best channel conditions and transmit data to her .",
    "when the user is selected blindly , the power may be irreversibly lost to a `` bad '' user .    in this paper",
    "we introduce _ backtrack retransmission ( brq ) _ , capable to use the delayed csit in a way that approaches the average throughput achieved with prior csit and fixed transmission power",
    ". a prominent feature of brq is that it adapts the data rate using a fixed rate@xmath6 codebook at the physical layer and fixed packet length , but only changing the amount of parity bits based on the delayed csit .",
    "thus , brq operates as markov block coding , where the correlation between the adjacent packets depends on the amount of ir parity bits . by selecting asymptotically high rate @xmath0 and when the delayed csit is full , the average throughput becomes equal to the one with prior csit",
    "however , this happens at the expense of asymptotically increased delay .",
    "the extension of brq to the case with a finite number of feedback bits gives rise to a novel transmission scheme : instead of sending feedback after each packet , the feedback bits from multiple slots are assembled and , using vector quantization , provide information relevant to a number of packets transmitted in the past .",
    "this challenges the conventional wisdom in arq protocols , in which the content of the feedback bits is only associated with the transmission immediately preceding those bits .",
    "the price paid by the brq is in the increased delay .",
    "the problem of harq over block fading channels has been addressed in many works , but two recent works stand out in their relation to the current work , @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the scenario considered in @xcite is essentially different from our scenario of interest , as the csit in is not delayed , but it arrives through a finite number of bits as a prior csit , such that the transmitter can adapt the power .",
    "the reference @xcite provides good insights on the role of the feedback as a csit quantizer , but the feedback bits are associated only with the immediately preceding transmission and it is not allowed to accumulate feedback bits over consecutive slots , as we do in the quantized scheme in section  [ sec : quant_brq ] . the scenario considered in @xcite",
    "is directly related to the one treated in this paper , as the authors assume that at the time of transmission , the received csit is not correlated with the actual conditions on the channel .",
    "the ir bits in @xcite are sent in a standalone way , using variable - length packets  the authors of @xcite correctly point out that this could be a problem in multiuser systems and therefore they propose a workaround by grouping multiple transmissions into fixed - length resources . on the other hand , our approach works with fixed - length packets / slots at the physical layer , such that it naturally follows the modus operandi of the contemporary wireless systems , such as e. g. lte  @xcite .",
    "the method in @xcite uses rate adaptation at the physical layer , while in our case the physical layer parameters are fixed and a single combination of coding / modulation of rate @xmath0 is applied .",
    "regarding the implementation of ir , both @xcite and @xcite describe it implicitly , through sufficient accumulated mutual information , while our scheme is based on explicit method for creating the ir bits through random binning .",
    "the approach in @xcite gives rise to a complex optimization problem for determining the ir bits and the rate , while in our method this is straightforwardly based on the mechanism of random binning .",
    "finally , we extend our method with delayed csit to the case with finite - bit feedback , while @xcite treats only the case of full delayed csit .    we remark here that the issue of delayed csit has recently sparkled a significant interest in terms of improvements that can be achieved in terms of degrees of freedom at high snrs  @xcite  @xcite . however , that line of work does not deal with harq protocols and is directed towards multi - user scenarios , while in our case we consider relatively low snr and a single link .",
    "we consider a single - user channel with block fading and gaussian noise . from this point on we use the term snr , as we will not explicitly consider interference and attribute the channel variation to fading , but we keep in mind that the concepts are applicable to sinr .",
    "tx transmits to rx in slots , each slot contains a full packet and takes @xmath7 channel uses . the value of @xmath7 is fixed , unless stated otherwise , and sufficiently large to offer reliable communication that is optimal in an information - theoretic sense .",
    "the complex @xmath8dimensional received signal vector in slot @xmath9 is : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the transmitted signal normalized to have unit power and @xmath12 is a complex random vector with unit variance that represents the contribution of the noise and the interference in slot @xmath9 .",
    "hence , the snr in the @xmath13th slot is equal to @xmath14 , drawn independently from a probability density @xmath15 and is unknown to tx prior to the transmission .",
    "we note that ( [ eq : receivedsignal ] ) assumes a fixed transmission power , which is reasonable considering the fact that we always assume that @xmath14 is unknown when the transmission takes place ; more elaboration will follow .",
    "tx uses a single code / modulation combination of rate @xmath0 and thus sends a total of @xmath16 data bits in the packet .",
    "the maximal rate that the channel tx - rx can support in slot @xmath9 is : @xmath17}\\ ] ] if @xmath18 then rx receives the packet correctly , otherwise an outage occurs . upon outage ,",
    "rx buffers the received signal in order to use it in future decoding attempts .",
    "an efficient way to treat the outage is to use _ incremental redundancy ( ir ) _",
    "@xcite : tx sends additional @xmath19 parity bits to rx , which rx can combine with the signal received during the previous @xmath7 channel uses and thus possibly recover the original packet .",
    "if tx uses @xmath20 channel uses to transmits the @xmath21 additional bits and eventually the packet is decoded correctly , then the data rate achieved between tx and rx is @xmath22 . note that in general @xmath23 .",
    "optimal _ incremental redundancy would select the retransmitted bits in such a way that if the accumulated mutual information at the receiver becomes sufficient , the signal is decoded @xcite @xcite .",
    "the interesting question is how is @xmath24 related to the channel capacity @xmath25 ?      for the first example , tx sends the packet using a slot with @xmath7 channel uses and learns the snr @xmath26 after the slot .",
    "the value of @xmath26 is such that @xmath27 and an outage occurs .",
    "for this example we deviate from our model in two ways : ( 1 ) we temporarily break away from the fixed slot structure and assume that the retransmission from tx can take @xmath20 channel uses , where @xmath23 ( as in @xcite ) ; ( 2 ) the snr during those @xmath20 channel uses is constant and equal to @xmath26 , such that tx can perfectly choose the transmission rate used to send the ir bits without experiencing outage . by knowing @xmath26 , tx knows that rx has a side information about the transmitted packet that amounts to @xmath28 bits , such that the minimal amount of parity bits that @xmath1 should provide to @xmath2 in order to decode the packet is : @xmath29 the _ operational interpretation _ of the minimal number of parity bits bears resemblance to _ random binning _ , introduced in the slepian - wolf problem of distributed source coding  @xcite . in the slepian - wolf problem , the amount of information that one node sends depends on the knowledge of the side information that the other node provides to the receiver . in our setting with a retransmission , tx can act as two different senders separated in time : after the first transmission , tx learns from the csit the amount of side information available at rx , adjusts the amount of parity bits and sends them to rx . specifically",
    ", tx divides the @xmath30 messages into @xmath31 bins , where the number of bins is adjusted to the received csit , and x sends to rx @xmath21 bits to describe to which bin the previous message belongs to .",
    "if rx decodes the @xmath21 bits correctly , it combines the bin information with the side information present at rx from the first @xmath7 channel uses and , rx can decode the original @xmath32 bits correctly almost surely as @xmath33 .",
    "the rate at which tx sends the redundancy bits is @xmath34 , such that number of channel uses for retransmission is : @xmath35 and the equivalent rate achieved from tx to rx is : @xmath36 which is the same as if tx knew the csit a priori .",
    "we can conclude that , if the channel is constant during the original rate-@xmath0 transmission and the incremental redundancy transmission , but tx can only learn the csit after the first transmission , the achievable rate between tx and rx is : @xmath37 besides the inability to adapt the power , the penalty for not knowing the prior csit can occur due to a low value of @xmath0 , i.  e. tx can not take advantage of the very high snrs .    th slot , @xmath38 are the new bits and @xmath39 are the redundancy bits , used as a bin index to decode the transmission in slot @xmath40 . ]    but a careful reader can object to the consistency of the previous example .",
    "first , to send the ir bits , tx uses a prior csit , such that the example can not cover e. g. a scenario with intermittent interferer .",
    "knowing csit in advance also opens the possibility for employing power control , as in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we persist to the assumption that the channel must be unknown at the time of transmission and ask whether we can still recover the rate .",
    "furthermore , the example violates the required fixed - slot structure and a single coding / modulation combination with a fixed rate .",
    "therefore , as a second example assume that tx sends to tx in slots with fixed size of @xmath7 channel uses .",
    "the snr from slot to slot is uncorrelated and available to tx only after the transmission .",
    "let tx always apply the same transmission rate @xmath0 and let us observe three consecutive slots with snrs equal to @xmath41 .",
    "this is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : backtracking3slots ] .",
    "we deliberately select the snrs to satisfy @xmath42 such that outage occurs in the first two slots and , eventually , the transmission of tx can be decoded in the third slot .",
    "tx transmits @xmath16 new bits in the first slot , denoted by @xmath43 . for the second slot",
    ", tx knows @xmath44 and sends again @xmath16 data bits , but the message is prepared in the following way :    * the first @xmath45 bits are parity bits , denoted by @xmath46 , used to describe the bin index that can be combined with the signal from slot 1 to recover the bits @xmath43 . *",
    "the remaining @xmath47 bits , denoted by @xmath48 are _ new bits _ transmitted in the second slot .",
    "it must be noted that the parity bits and the new bits are only separable in a digital domain , but not at the physical layer i.  e. the whole packet , sent at rate @xmath0 , needs to be decoded correctly and then rx extracts the parity bits and the new bits .",
    "the insertion of parity bits creates dependency between two adjacent packet transmissions , such that the scheme effectively applies markov block coding .    coming back to the example",
    ", outage also occurs in the second slot , such that the message in the third slot consists of @xmath49 redundancy bits @xmath50 and @xmath51 new bits @xmath52 .",
    "note that , according to the illustration on fig .",
    "[ fig : backtracking3slots ] , in the example @xmath53 , which means that @xmath54 .",
    "as @xmath55 , rx decodes the message slot 3 and recovers @xmath52 and @xmath50 .",
    "it then uses @xmath50 as incremental redundancy to decode the transmission in slot 2 and recover @xmath56 and @xmath46 .",
    "finally , rx uses @xmath46 to decode the transmission from slot 1 and recover @xmath43 .",
    "the average rate is @xmath57 , which results in @xmath58 the average rate that could have been achieved over the three slots if the csit were known a priori is : @xmath59 again , a loss compared to prior csit can occur due to low @xmath0 , but otherwise the data rates that are achievable with prior csit can be recovered with delayed csit .",
    "the second example illustrates the central proposal in this paper , ir with _ backtrack retransmission ( brq)_. we note that power adaptation can not help under the assumption that the snr @xmath14 is unknown and uncorrelated with @xmath60 at the time of transmission and here is a sketch of the argument to support this . referring to fig .",
    "[ fig : backtracking3slots ] , it should be noted that rx does not have any side information about the bits @xmath46 and @xmath50 , since they represent the minimal amount of information that needs to be retransmitted .",
    "therefore , the information carried in @xmath46 and @xmath50 is new in the same sense that the information in @xmath61 is new .",
    "hence , each transmitted packet carries equal amount of @xmath62 new information bits and , since the channel is not known in advance and for symmetry reasons , the transmission power should be equal in each slot .",
    "here we specify the brq protocol with full csit .",

    "instead , we use the @xmath163 bits per snr in a suboptimal way , making a vector quantization according to @xmath95 .",
    "this is clearly suboptimal as rx reports to tx also quantized versions of the snr values @xmath176 , which is redundant .",
    "therefore , the distortion computed accordion to the result from  @xcite represent an upper bound on the distortion that can be achieved if we ( properly ) quantize according to @xmath177 : @xmath178 as @xmath0 increases , @xmath159 and @xmath179 decrease , while @xmath177 becomes better approximated by @xmath15 , such that the upper bound in  ( [ eq : upperbounddist ] ) becomes tight .",

    "two different transmission rates are chosen , @xmath182 and @xmath183 , respectively .",
    "note that by such a choice , we are fixing the decoding probability to @xmath184 and @xmath185 , respectively .",
    "the scheme with quantized csit is evaluated by using the rate distortion function of the exponential distribution , such that @xmath148 is determined according to  ( [ eq : exp_dist_bound ] ) , which is suboptimal . as a reference ,",
    "we have also plotted the average rate when full csit is known a priori , but no water filling ( fixed power ) is applied .",
    "when full csit is available and the transmission rate @xmath0 is sufficiently high , then the knowledge of posterior csit is equally useful as the prior csit for average snrs @xmath186 and higher .",
    "furthermore , as water filling is more significant at low snrs , we can see that with @xmath183 and full csit , brq tightly approaches the average rate obtainable by water filling for @xmath180 equal to @xmath187 db or higher .",
    "the scheme with quantized csit converges to a fixed value as @xmath180 increases ( proof omitted due to lack of space ) .",

    "we see that the schemes @xmath190 still grow in the region in which the scheme with @xmath191 is saturated .",
    "the reason is that the schemes with low @xmath114 are additionally affected by the decrease of @xmath179 as @xmath159 grows , which affects the value of @xmath148 , while @xmath179 has a negligible effect for @xmath191 .        ,",

    "the main objective of this paper is to introduce a class of new transmission schemes based on backtrack retransmission ( brq ) that are useful when the csit can only be available after the transmission has taken place .",
    "compared to the existing works on the topic , brq offers an elegant way to use the full posterior csit , based on adaptive markov block coding , thereby closely approaching the average throughput achievable with prior csit . by extending the ideas of brq to the case where only a finite number of feedback bits are available",
    ", we have introduced a way to use the feedback bits which significantly departs from the standard way in which these bits are used in harq protocols .",
    "we devise a scheme in which it is possible to assemble multiple feedback bits and jointly report multiple csit values through vector quantization .    in this initial work on the topic",
    "we have used the asymptotic information - theoretic results , valid when the number of channel uses per slot @xmath7 and when the number of slots in a block @xmath107 ( used in vector quantization ) goes to infinity .",
    "when finite values of @xmath7 and @xmath107 are considered , then the protocol should be adjusted in order to account for nonzero probability of error in the transmission as well as in the recovery based on the random binning .",
    "this analysis will be put in an extended version of this paper .",
    "another interesting aspect is the choice of the distortion criterion .",
    "we have chosen @xmath148 to be constant , but in general @xmath148 should depends on the snr value and the optimal @xmath148 should maximize the average rate .    an interesting extension would be to generalize brq to multi - user scenarios . on the other hand , considering the practicality of the assumption about the posterior csit ,",
    "the presented method is relevant for the practical wireless systems , such as lte , based on fixed - size physical resources and significantly affected by intermittent interference from neighboring cells .",
    "it is therefore important to explore how brq can be implemented with practical coding / modulation schemes .",
