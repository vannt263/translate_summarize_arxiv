    "in the last decade a vast set of unpolarized cross sections has been determined for the @xmath1 production in the collision of nucleons @xcite .",
    "however , the understanding of the production mechanism of this meson still requires the determination of spin observables . up to",
    "now there are only three measurements of the analyzing power for the @xmath0 reaction which have been performed with low statistics and the determined value of the analyzing power is essentially consistent with zero @xcite within large error bars of about @xmath2 .",
    "wasa detector installed at the cooler synchrotron cosy gives a possibility to measure the analyzing power with high statistics and high acceptance .",
    "therefore , in november 2010 we have conducted an exclusive measurement of the @xmath0 reaction using the polarized proton beam of the cosy synchrotron and the wasa detector @xcite .",
    "the measurement was performed for two beam momenta corresponding to @xmath3  mev and @xmath4  mev excess energies .",
    "the choice of these values of excess energies was dictated by the availability of the data for the spin averaged cross sections obtained previously at cosy-11 @xcite , tof @xcite and wasa / celsius @xcite experiments .",
    "for the purpose of the monitoring of the degree of polarization , concurrently to the @xmath0 reaction , a proton - proton elastic scattering reactions have been measured . in this contribution",
    "we present an estimation of systematic uncertainties of the determination of the degree of polarization of the cosy beam based on the elastically scattered protons measured by means of the wasa detector setup .",
    "the polarization is extracted using the following formula : @xmath5 were @xmath6 is the scattering angle of the forward going proton calculated in the centre of mass frame , @xmath7 is its azimuthal angle , @xmath8 denotes the number of events and @xmath9 is the analyzing power of the @xmath10 reaction which was extracted from the results of the edda collaboration @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry , @xmath11 , is defined as @xmath12 and , according to eq .",

    "the asymmetry is calculated separately for each spin orientation of the polarized protons in four ranges of protons scattering angle starting from @xmath15 up to @xmath16 in steps of @xmath17 . as a result ,",
    "four polarizations are extracted for four ranges of the center - of - mass polar angle of the forward scattered proton , @xmath18 .",
    "the final polarization for a given spin is then calculated as a weighted mean @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the scattering angle of the forward going proton , calculated in the centre of mass system .",
    "the probable source of the systematic uncertainty in the determination of the polarization might be wrong number of events in the individual @xmath18 ranges , originating from the possible misalignment of the beam and/or target position .",
    "the reconstruction of tracks of particles registered in the mini drift chamber is free of any assumption of the position of the reaction vertex . in this respect , obtained angular information can be assumed to reflect the actual situation of particles going through the mini drift chamber .",
    "however , reconstruction of tracks of particles going in the forward direction , is based on the assumption that the interaction point is located at @xmath21 .",

    "while the change of the @xmath25 or @xmath43 coordinate does not have influence on the result , a certain sensitivity of polarization is seen in case of changing the @xmath41 coordinate of the interaction point .",
    "namely , the calculated value of the polarization changes linearly with the shift of the vertex along the @xmath68axis .",

    "it is seen , that for @xmath70 , the polarization strongly deviates from the expected value when changing the @xmath41 coordinate by more than 5 mm .",
    "therefore , since the polarization for higher angles is biased by the systematics , we should restrict the used @xmath18 angle to less than @xmath71 .",

    "a result is similar as shown in fig .",
    "[ f : pol_th_acc ] .",

    "it might be noticed as well that data , generated with @xmath25 or @xmath43 set to @xmath74  mm and corrected to different @xmath69 , do not influence the polarization significantly .",
    "another way to control the location of the vertex position in the experiment is to monitor the coplanarity , @xmath75 , defined as @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 correspond to two scattered protons and @xmath79 is the vector of the beam .",

    "since , in this case , the events originate from all posibble vertex positions distributed within the region of the beam and target overlap , the points on the histogram should be arranged uniformly around @xmath82 .",
