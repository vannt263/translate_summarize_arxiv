    "<S> the b quark forward - backward asymmetry has been measured using hadronic  decays collected by the opal experiment at lep . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 decays were selected using a combination of secondary vertex and lepton tags , and the sign of the b quark charge was determined using an inclusive tag based on jet , vertex and kaon charges . </S>",
    "<S> the results , corrected to the quark level , are :    [ cols=\"<,^ , < , < \" , ]     where in each case the first error is statistical and the second systematic . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown as a function of @xmath1 in figure  [ f : afbvse ] , together with the standard model expectation calculated using zfitter @xcite . using the zfitter prediction for the dependence of  on @xmath1 , the three measurements are shifted to   ( 91.19gev ) , averaged and corrected for initial state radiation , @xmath2 exchange , @xmath3 interference and b quark mass effects . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting value for the  pole asymmetry  is @xmath4 where again the first error is statistical and the second systematic . within the framework of the standard model </S>",
    "<S> , this corresponds to an effective weak mixing angle for electrons of @xmath5 this result is one of the most precise measurements of the b quark forward - backward asymmetry to date . </S>",
    "<S> it is in agreement with , and supersedes , the previous opal result using jet and vertex charge @xcite , and is also in agreement with the opal measurement using leptons @xcite and other measurements of  at lep @xcite . </S>"
