    "the partonic content of real and virtual photons can be measured , for example , in electron positron scattering .",
    "the measured @xmath0 cross section can be obtained by a convolution of a flux of target photons @xcite with the cross section of deep inelastic electron photon scattering @xmath1 the virtuality of the target photon , @xmath2 , has to be much smaller than the virtuality @xmath3 of the probe photon such that the neglected terms of order @xmath4 are small .    in the following ,",
    "we are interested in the photon structure function @xmath5 which enters the deep inelastic electron photon cross section in exactly the same way as is well known from deep inelastic electron proton scattering @xmath6    @xmath7 is a convolution of the _ massless _ parton densities of the real or virtual photon with the respective _ massless _ wilson coefficients , in order to obtain a factorization scheme independent , physically meaningful result @xcite @xmath8\\ . \\label{f2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this also holds for the direct photon coefficient @xmath9 , @xmath9 has to be the massless direct photon coefficient ( irrespective of @xmath2 ) since it is related to the massless photon to quark and photon to gluon splitting functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the evolution equations .    as usual",
    ", we work in nlo in the dis@xmath12 scheme in which the destabilizing @xmath13 of @xmath9 , as calculated in the @xmath14 scheme in ( [ f2 ] ) , is absorbed into the quark distributions @xmath15 again , it should be emphasized that we use the _ real photon _",
    "coefficient irrespective of @xmath2 .",
    "the parton distributions are then obtained by qcd evolution of appropriate boundary conditions at a low scale @xmath16 gev@xmath17 , which will be presented in the following . the exact lo and nlo values of the universal ( i.  e.  hadron ",
    "independent ) input scale @xmath18 are fixed by the experimentally well constrained radiative parton densities of the proton @xcite .",
    "the boundary condition for the real photon @xcite is given by a vector meson dominance ( vmd ) ansatz where ( at the low scale @xmath18 ) the physical photon is assumed to be a coherent superposition of vector mesons which have the same quantum numbers as the photon @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) .",
    "this optimal coherence maximally enhances the up quark which is favoured by the experimental data .    since parton distributions of vector mesons ( @xmath24 ,",
    "are unknown we furthermore assume that these are similar to pionic parton distributions . thus , for given pionic parton distributions our model has no free parameter .",
    "since only the pionic valence density is experimentally rather well known , we utilize a constituent quark model to relate the pionic light sea and gluon to the much better known parton distributions of the proton @xcite . in this model the proton and pion",
    "are described by scale independent constituent distributions ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 , ... ) convoluted with their universal partonic content @xmath27 @xcite @xmath28 f_c \\left ( \\frac{x}{y } , q^2\\right)\\\\ f^{\\pi } & = & \\int_x^1\\frac{dy}{y } \\left [ u^{\\pi^+}(y)+    \\bar{d}\\,^{\\pi^+}(y)\\right ] f_c \\left ( \\frac{x}{y } , q^2\\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 .    since in mellin-@xmath30-space",
    "the convolution is a simple product , the ratio @xmath31 is independent of the flavour @xmath32 and one can easily find boundary conditions for the pionic gluon and sea which only depend on the rather well determined valence distribution of the pion and the parton distributions of the proton @xcite @xmath33      in this subsection boundary conditions for the much more speculative virtual photon are proposed .",
    "first recall that the photonic parton distributions can be written as a sum of a pointlike and a hadronic part @xmath34 the pointlike part is a particular solution of the inhomogenous evolution equations of the photon and vanishes by definition at the input scale @xmath35 : @xmath36 . while the pointlike solution is perturbatively calculable , the homogenous ( hadronic ) solution requires a boundary condition . at @xmath37",
    "we assume the hadronic part of the virtual photon to be given by the hadronic part of the real photon suppressed by a rho - meson propagator @xmath38 : @xmath39 this boundary condition of course smoothly extrapolates to the real photon case .",
    "note that , the employed dipole suppression factor is somewhat speculative and can be regarded as the simplest choice of modelling the @xmath2suppression .",
    "in fig .  [ fig1b ] we compare our lo and nlo predictions for @xmath40 , given by the full and dashed lines , with experimental data @xcite . also shown",
    "are the grv@xmath41 @xcite predictions which are steeper in the small-@xmath42 region ( due to the steeper sea , which has been generated from a vanishing input ) . in all cases",
    "the charm contribution has been added according to a fixed order calculation ( see , e.g. , eqs .",
    "( 15 ) and ( 16 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "as one can see , we achieve a good description of the data , particularly in the region of small @xmath3 where the grv@xmath12 and also the sas 1d @xcite expectations fall somewhat below the data .",
    "furthermore , our lo and nlo results are close together demonstrating an excellent perturbative stability .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath42dependence of the up quark and the gluon for three values of @xmath3 .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are our nlo and lo results , respectively .",
    "the dotted lines are the nlo grv@xmath41 distributions .    comparing the solid lines with",
    "the dashed  dotted lines , representing the hadronic contribution to the solid lines , one can see that for @xmath43 the pointlike part dominates ( especially for the quark distribution ) , whereas at very small x the hadronic component is dominant implying a small@xmath42 behaviour similar to the pion or proton .      in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we compare the @xmath42-dependence of our gluon distribution with recent h1 measurements @xcite .",
    "the full data points are dijet events and the open points are high @xmath45 track events .",
    "our lo and nlo results are very similar to the gluon of sas 1d , shown by the dotted line . the flatter small-@xmath42 behaviour compared to grv@xmath41",
    "is partly induced by the flatter gluon distribution in the grv-98 proton @xcite .",
    "( another reason is that the grv@xmath12 gluon is enhanced by a factor @xmath46 in nlo ( lo ) at @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( 2 ) in @xcite . )",
    "figure [ fig9 ] is the virtual photon analogue of fig .",
    "again the @xmath42-dependence of the up quark and the gluon is shown for two values of @xmath3 and several photon virtualities @xmath2 .",
    "the solid and dashed curves are our nlo and lo distributions , respectively , whereas the dotted curves are the nlo predictions of glck , reya and stratmann @xcite , denoted by grs . for @xmath48 gev@xmath17",
    "we also show the lo grs up quark distributions ( wide dotted ) , which are very similar to our lo results .    on",
    "can see that the pointlike part becomes increasingly important with increasing @xmath2 due to the dipole suppression of the hadronic component [ @xmath49 . at @xmath50",
    "gev@xmath17 the hadronic part is nearly vanishing even at small @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , note the perturbative stability of the parton distributions guaranteeing the required stability of the physical structure functions .",
    "finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we compare our lo parton distributions with an effective parton density @xmath51 which has been extracted from h1 dijet data @xcite .",
    "@xmath52 and we show results for two values of @xmath42 in dependence of the photon virtuality . the transition from the solid to the dashed line indicates that for @xmath2 approaching @xmath3 the concept of renormalization group resummed parton distributions of virtual photons is not expected to hold any more , because the resummed logarithms @xmath53 arising in the partonic subprocesses are not much larger than the non - logarithmic terms .    in the relevant kinematic region",
    "@xmath54 the agreement with the data is reasonably good .",
    "this is in contrast to a simple dipole suppression of the real photon @xmath55 , as illustrated by the dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , which fails to describe the data .",
