    "rich clusters of galaxies provide a uniquely amenable setting for the study of the complex processes and consequences of galaxy formation and evolution . as the largest ( @xmath4 ) virialized objects in the universe , with the deepest potential wells , they retain all of their processed and unprocessed baryonic matter in the form of stars and ( predominantly ) @xmath5 kev plasma that are readily studied at infrared / optical / ultraviolet and x - ray wavelengths , respectively .",
    "rich clusters are sufficiently vast to be considered representative volumes of the universe and are often assumed to be composed of dark matter , stars , and gas in cosmic proportions .",
    "however , because clusters originate as extreme peaks in the random field of initial cosmological density fluctuations , the evolution of their constituent galaxies  and by extension the intergalactic medium that they are coupled to  may proceed in a manner that is distinct from their counterparts in the field .",
    "the resulting biases must be understood , and taken into account , when generalizing from cluster - based observables in order to draw conclusions about the universe as a whole .",
    "in fact , the morphological mix , luminosity function , and star formation history of cluster galaxies all display signatures of the effects of the exceptionally dense environments where they form and develop @xcite . since galactic outflows associated with the galaxy formation process , in turn , feed back on the cluster environment by injecting energy and metals into intergalactic plasma , evidence of the cluster / field dichotomy is implanted in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "the distinctions between the evolution of baryons in clusters and in the field may be quantified by the juxtaposition of the build - up of heavy metals in the universe inferred from the evolving star formation and supernovae rates with the enrichment history of the icm in rich galaxy clusters  the dominant reservoir for metals produced by stars in the ensemble of cluster galaxies . because , under intracluster plasma conditions , abundances of fe are more easily measured than those of other elements they are derived to redshifts @xmath6 and provide the strongest current constraints on the evolution of icm enrichment .",
    "@xcite made an initial investigation along these lines based on their analysis of _ asca _ spectra of clusters out to @xmath7 , and concluded that icm enrichment was inconsistent with concurrent estimates of the star formation rate history derived for field galaxies ( see , also , madau , pozzetti , & dickinson 1998 ; lin & mohr 2004 ; calura & matteucci 2004 ) .",
    "re - examination of this issue is timely given the extension to higher redshift of icm fe abundance measurements made possible with _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , and direct estimates of the evolution of supernova rates to comparable redshift in the field @xcite and in clusters @xcite that constrain the level of supernova metal production per unit star formation .",
    "star formation with a standard initial mass function ( imf ) produces approximately one core collapse supernova ( hereafter , snii ) per hundred solar masses of stars formed , while recent empirical estimates for the specific rate of type ia supernovae ( snia ) are an order of magnitude lower . for typical",
    "adopted fe yields of @xmath8 for snii ( slightly higher than the empirical estimate of elmhamdi , chugai , & danziger 2003 ) and @xmath9 for snia @xcite , the estimated universal fraction of baryons in stars of @xmath10 @xcite thus implies an fe enrichment per baryon of @xmath11 relative to solar ( solar fe mass fraction @xmath12 ) that originates in comparable portions from the two classes of supernovae , where @xmath13 is the stellar mass loss fraction integrated over the age of the universe .",
    "since @xmath14% for a standard imf ( see below ) , one expects a mean universal fe enrichment per baryon to about one - tenth solar . while this may be consistent with the low - redshift ( non - cluster ) igm ( prochaska 2004 ; also , see  4.1 below ) , it falls short by a factor of @xmath15 in the icm ( see , also , pagel 2002 ) .",
    "a simple way to account for this shortfall is to invoke a top - heavy imf @xcite to enhance the formation efficiency of snii , and perhaps snia . additional variations ( some linked to the imf ) include the following : ( 1 ) a higher average star formation rate ( more snii and snia ) , ( 2 ) a higher incidence of snia per star formed , ( 3 ) a higher average fe yield per ( type ia and/or type ii ) supernova , ( 4 ) a significant enrichment by a pregalactic stellar population ( e.g. , loewenstein 2001 ) . the relative dearth of supernovae in clusters out to the highest redshifts for which the rate is presently constrained highlights the cluster abundance paradox , and begs the question of whether one or more of the standard assumptions ( e.g. , an imf that is universal and invariant over time ) break down in the universe _ in general_.    this paper aims to evaluate the plausibility and consequences of possible explanations for icm fe enrichment , taking into account constraints based on the characteristics of stellar populations in cluster galaxies as well as the observed mean evolution of the cluster snia rate and fe abundance ; and , to examine the resulting implications for our understanding of the star formation history ( sfh ) in the universe and its dependence on environment .    new data on the _ histories _ of star formation , supernovae rates , and elemental abundances motivate an approach that goes beyond consideration of the baryon and metal inventories to explicitly model their self - consistent evolution .",
    "the framework adopted here for constructing such models , as presented in  2 , is kept simple to restrict the number of possible parameters while allowing for consideration of an extensive range in each parameter , and to maintain the transparency of the effects and implications of various assumptions and scenarios .",
    "boundary conditions , source functions , and parameters are initially designed as appropriate for the universe as a whole ; but ; clear paths for adaptations that might be required for rich galaxy clusters are provided .",
    "models for the chemical evolution of fe in the icm are presented in  3 , and the requirements on the nature of star formation and supernovae in cluster galaxies imposed by observations are indicated and summarized .",
    " 4 includes discussion of the distinction between clusters and the field with respect to their intergalactic media and galaxy populations , and more detailed analysis of galactic outflows and fe enrichment in clusters .",
    "implications for the nature of snia and its environmental dependence , comparisons with results of similar investigations , and possible directions for future model enhancements are also presented in this section .",
    "conclusions , with an emphasis on the dichotomy between clusters and the field , are summarized in  5 .",
    "i adopt a topologically flat cosmology with hubble constant @xmath16 km s@xmath17 , and total and baryonic matter densities , relative to critical , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively ( e.g. , fukugita & peebles 2004 ) .",

    "the imf parameters are the slope at high mass , @xmath52 , and transition mass , @xmath51 , to this slope from @xmath56 .",
    "the choice of imf , in turn , determines the mass return fraction @xmath13 ( equation 14 ) and renormalization factor for the star formation rate ( equation 15 ) , and the number of snii per unit mass of star formation , @xmath113 .",

    "if the slope is significantly flatter , ( 1 ) the higher stellar mass loss return fraction ( figure 1 ) implies that a higher star formation rate than is observed would be required to produce the observed amount of stars ( figure 2 ) ; and , ( 2 ) the implied snii rate would be greater than observed ( figure 3a ) .",
    "conversely , a steeper high mass imf slope ( i.e. , @xmath132 ; see kroupa & weidner 2003 ) significantly underpredicts the observed snii rate @xcite unless the transition at @xmath51 is pushed to high mass ( figure 3b ) .",
    "the chemical evolution of fe in the standard model ( see entries `` 1n2.3 '' in tables 1 and 2 ) provides predictions to be compared with abundance measurements in stars and interstellar gas in field galaxies , and in the intergalactic medium .",
    "this serves to indicate possible shortcomings in the model and provide a baseline for evaluating what manner of extension or variation might be required to explain fe abundances in rich galaxy clusters . integrated over a hubble time ,",
    "the total stellar fe yield ( relative to solar ) in the standard model is 1.3 ( 58/42% from snia / snii ) corresponding to an enrichment of 0.13 averaged over all baryons ( table 2 ) .",
    "the model - predicted @xmath133 snii and snia rates ( table 2 ) are consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "the distribution of fe among stellar , ism , and igm components as a function of time depends on the strength and time - dependence of galactic outflow .",
    "the more numerous snii dominate the galactic wind term ( equation 21 ) , but snia contribute the majority of fe enrichment  and do so with a significant lag with respect to the accumulation of stellar mass and the ejection of snii - enriched material into the igm .",
    "this results in a relatively recent ( @xmath134 ) build - up of fe in the stars ( figure 4a ) and ism ( figure 4b ) and a substantial fe mass fraction contained in these components at the present epoch . as a result , little more than half of the total fe production",
    "is injected into the igm for a `` maximum '' wind ( figure 5 ) .",
    "a reapportionment that boosts the igm fe fraction requires extending the outflow duration , a possible mechanism considered in detail below .",
    "a comparison , focusing on the @xmath135 universe , of the enrichment buildup in these models with the inventory of metals derived from observations of damped ly@xmath136 systems , the ly@xmath136 forest , and lyman break galaxies is made in  4.1 below .",
    "the formalism of the previous section can be directly adapted to investigate the chemical evolution of stars , ism , and igm ( icm ) in clusters  assuming that they are closed boxes  by simply rescaling the physical densities by the mean cluster baryon overdensity factor ( i.e. , the total overdensity multiplied by a cluster baryon `` bias '' factor  see , e.g. , allen et al . 2004 ) , @xmath137 .",
    "clearly , the standard model must be adjusted in application to clusters as it predicts an igm fe abundance @xmath138 times smaller than measured in the icm .",
    "there is strong evidence that star formation ensued more quickly in clusters with respect to the field , as one might expect in regions of highest initial overdensity @xcite .",
    "however , this in itself does not result in enhanced enrichment if the integrated star formation and imf are unaltered .",
    "estimates for the rich cluster mass fraction in stars vary , but are typically twice the estimated universal value of @xmath10 ( see  4.4 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the fe enrichment shortfall persists if the yield per star formed is that of the standard model @xcite",
    ". moreover , there are claims of still higher stellar mass fractions in galaxy groups @xcite ; yet , group igm fe abundances are not generally higher than in the icm ( though groups may not be closed boxes ) .",
    "therefore , as elaborated on below , a top - heavy imf may be required to explain the observed 0.4 solar icm fe abundance .    while much of the star formation in intermediate and low mass galaxies occurs after the peak in the universal sfh at @xmath139 , the most massive ( elliptical ) galaxies were assembled and their star formation completed at earlier epochs @xcite . since the fraction of stars formed in elliptical galaxies is higher in clusters and star formation",
    "is expected to be accelerated in denser environments @xcite , i consider an enhancement in star formation , referred to as the `` rapid mode '' , with an exponential time - dependence , @xmath140 .",
    "these stars may reside in protogalactic fragments , or even in isolation in intracluster space @xcite .",
    "star formation in these extended models is characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath141 , the normalizations of the `` normal '' ( i.e. , with the same time - dependence as the average field star formation rate ; see figure 2 ) and rapid star formation modes ( expressed , in table 1 , as the present - epoch stellar baryon fractions : @xmath142 and @xmath143 , respectively ) , and the imf of each mode ( i.e. , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 ; in practice , when considering a nonzero exponential star formation contribution , @xmath114 is often adopted ) . for the models discussed in the next section @xmath146 is chosen .",
    "if the ratio of intergalactic gas to stars in clusters is the same as the universal average , @xmath147 , severe difficulties , as described in  2 , emerge in constructing models that reproduce observed cluster fe abundances .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 6 , where the solid curve plots the relationship between the ratio of the fe abundance in galaxies ( i.e. , a mass - weighted average of stars and ism ) to that in the icm versus the mass fraction of fe in the icm , assuming the universal igm fraction of 0.924 .",
    "a conservative upper limit to the ratio of galactic - to - intergalactic fe abundances of 5 requires that @xmath148% of the fe reside in the icm .",
    "however , as indicated above for the standard model , if galactic winds are driven by star formation while enrichment is more prolonged due to the delay in snia explosions , then more than half of the fe is locked up in galactic stars .",
    "this results in a galaxy / icm fe abundance ratio * @xmath149 * ( figure 6 ) .",
    "this problem is exacerbated if ( as expected ) star formation is accelerated in clusters relative to the field , but is mollified if star formation is more efficient",
    ". a galactic - to - intergalactic fe abundance ratio of 5 implies an icm fe mass fraction @xmath150% ( @xmath151% ) for a stellar mass fraction that is twice ( three times ) the universal average ( see dotted and dashed curves if figure 6 ) .    to transport sufficient fe from galaxies to the icm requires an outflow that is extended in time if the standard treatment of snia rates and yields , as previously defined , is adopted .",
    "i thus modify equation ( 21 ) by adding one of the two following terms : ( 1 ) @xmath152 ( additional exponential outflow term ) , or ( 2 ) @xmath153 ( additional constant outflow term ) , where @xmath154 is defined following equation ( 22 ) and @xmath155 and @xmath156 are additional parameters ( that modify the relationship between @xmath98 and @xmath157 ) .      the equations of  2 are solved for an extensive multi - dimensional grid of sfhs ( @xmath142 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 ) and outflow ( @xmath155 or @xmath158 , @xmath98 or",

    ", not necessarily to narrowly determine these parameters , but to reveal the general distinctions between these models and those constructed to explain standard universal chemical evolution .",
    "we will see that none of the models are fully satisfactory , thus motivating exploration of additional variations .",
    "details of an illustrative cross section of models that are examined in more detail are displayed in table 1 .",
    "these are labeled by ( 1 ) the present - day total stellar mass fraction relative to the universal value ( there are equal contributions from normal and rapid modes in all hybrid sfh models ) , and ( 2 ) whether the sfh follows the normal ( n ) or rapid ( r ) mode functional form , or a hybrid ( h ) of the two .",
    "they are further denoted by ( 3 ) the high mass imf slope ( @xmath52 or @xmath145 ) , where the rapid mode slope is used for the hybrid sfh models ( except for model 1h0.8wc where @xmath161 , the normal mode slope is 2.3 for all h - models ; table 1 ) .",

    "the present - day characteristics of these models are displayed in table 2 , and the evolution of the icm fe abundance back to @xmath165 for these models is illustrated and compared to observations in figures 7ab .",
    "since infall is not considered , ism abundances are significantly higher than stellar abundances ( see figure 4 ; also , figure 8b below ; and , pipino et al . 2005 ) .",
    "since one might expect higher metallicity ism to form stars more readily and equalize these , i define the `` galactic '' abundance , @xmath166 , as the mass - weighted average of the ism and galaxy fe abundances ( see table 2 ) ; @xmath166 serves as an upper limit to the stellar fe abundance .",
    "the following general statements can be made .",
    "( 1 ) as discussed above , a model with the form of the universal sfh , the universal fraction of baryons in stars , and standard transformation from star formation rate to supernova enrichment , falls many factors short of providing sufficient fe ( e.g. , model 1n2.3 ; solid curve in figure 7a ) .",
    "( 2 ) as illustrated by model 2h1.05 ( dotted curve in figure 7b ) , basic models where the outflow strictly traces the supernova rate generally predict fractions of fe locked up in stars ( and ism ) that are too high to yield consistency with present - day icm fe abundances ( for a reasonable galactic abundance , see discussion above ) .",
    "( 3 ) flattening the imf whilst retaining the standard model sfh form ( e.g. , model 1n1.05wc ; dotted curve in figure 7a ) produces the observed @xmath133 icm fe abundance if an extended outflow is assumed ; however , the buildup of fe is too recent to be consistent with x - ray spectroscopy of clusters over redshifts 01 @xcite .",
    "this is also the case in other models with insufficient massive star formation at high redshift , including model 1h0.8wc where the universal value for the baryon fraction in stars originates equally in normal and rapid star formation modes ( short - dashed curve in figure 7a ) .",
    "the observed magnitude and mild evolution of the icm fe abundance is fairly well reproduced in a variety of models with a top - heavy imf , prompt star formation , and extended outflow .",
    "these include models 1r1.05wc and 2r1.55wx where all star formation is in rapid mode ( long - dashed and dot - long - dashed curves in figure 7a , respectively ) , and in a number of hybrid ( `` 2h '' ) models that include both star formation modes .    the `` 2h '' series of models ( see tables 1 and 2 , and figure 7b ) are those characterized by sfhs producing twice the universal average of the present - day baryon fraction in stars ( see  4.4 ) , with half originating in normal star formation mode with a standard imf and half in rapid mode with a steeper high mass imf , that yield @xmath133 fe abundances",

    "large intermediate redshift snia rates in clusters are predicted in these models where the abundance and evolution of fe in the icm is explained via snii and snia from a top - heavy imf enhancement in high redshift star formation , and where the snia delay - time characteristics and relative normalization are the same as in the field .",
    "these rates are marginally inconsistent with the empirical cluster estimates , a characteristic shared by all models of the type discussed up to this point that successfully explain the icm fe abundance and its evolution .",

    "mannucci , della valle , & panagia ( 2006 ) argue for a bimodal population of snia that includes one subclass that is associated with active star formation and characterized by delay times that are insignificant relative to the duration of the star formation epoch , and another subclass associated with quiescent secular evolution that is characterized by a broad distribution extending to long delay times .",
    "i also , therefore , consider models where the reduction in mean delay time is exclusively applied to snia originating in rapid star formation mode ( model 2r1.55wxst  with only rapid mode star formation , model 2h1.05wxst2 ) .",

    "the snia rate evolution in these models , optimized to match the observed cluster fe abundance evolution ( figure 12a , ) is compared to that in models with earlier formation epoch in figure 12b .",
    "delaying the onset of star formation improves the match to cluster snia rate observations for @xmath176 gyr , but worsens it for @xmath177 gyr .",
    "i also construct models with `` naturally '' reduced rapid star formation mode specific snia rate  _",
    "i.e. _ the scaling is calculated assuming that a universal fraction of @xmath2 stars forms snia progenitor binaries .",
    "i consider models characterized by @xmath178 , @xmath114 , @xmath123 gyr , @xmath173 or 3 , @xmath177 or 0.5 gyr , and @xmath179 or @xmath180 ; and , focus here on an illustrative subset of `` 2h '' and `` 2r '' models ( i.e. , where 12% of present - day cluster baryons are in stars formed either in equal proportions in normal and rapid mode , or exclusively in rapid mode ) with @xmath181 and 1.55 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding rapid mode snia rate reduction factors are 0.26 and 0.66 .    in order for these models with reduced early snia enrichment to match the @xmath182 icm fe abundance evolution as well as , e.g. ,",
    "the models presented in figures 11a and 12a , an increase in mean snii fe yield to ( at least ) @xmath183 is required ( figure 13a ) . because the early icm fe enrichment is now dominated by snii , the icm fe evolution is less sensitive to the choice of @xmath175 ( for @xmath184 , the fall - off of icm fe with redshift in 2h models is steeper if @xmath177 gyr than if @xmath176 gyr ) .",
    "since the differences in the snia rate history emerge beyond the redshift where observed constraints are available ( figure 13b ) , the snia delay time in clusters is unconstrained by observations if the rapid star formation in cluster galaxies was characterized by a flat imf and high snii fe yields .",
    "note that with most of the fe enrichment due to snii in the rapid star formation mode , an extended outflow phase is no longer required  provided that the initial ism fraction , @xmath185 , is large ( e.g. , model 2r1.55stnz ) .",
    "inclusion of a prolonged outflow period reduces the required value of @xmath185 .",
    "a simple model for the chemical evolution of fe in the universe may be constructed using parameters drawn from the observed star formation , and type ii and type ia supernova , rates in the field population of galaxies that are mutually consistent for a standard imf .",
    "for fe yields of @xmath122 per snii and @xmath186 per snia , the baryons in the universe are enriched to an average fe abundance of 0.13 solar",
    ". the universal ratio of galactic - to - intergalactic baryons constrains the fraction of fe locked up in stars and cold gas such that stellar fe abundances are within a factor of two of solar with the precise value dependent on the magnitude and timing of galactic outflows .",
    "the prolonged epoch of star formation coupled with the snia delay shifts much of the fe enrichment to relatively recent ( @xmath134 ) epochs , as indicated by recent observations @xcite .",
    "if one naively assumes that rich galaxy clusters are pure representative samples of the universe , this global chemical evolution model directly scales to clusters and fe abundances in the icm are badly underestimated .",
    "however , in order to better understand the differences in the nature of star formation in cluster and field galaxies , it is instructive to adopt the field model as a point of departure for investigating the variations that are required to reproduce observed @xmath187 fe abundances of @xmath167 solar and mild ( @xmath168 ) icm fe abundance evolution .",
    "successful variations must include shifts to _ both _ higher redshift in the peak of the star formation rate , and to flatter high mass slopes in the imf for star formation at high redshift  implying that conversion of gas into stars is , on average , more efficient in rich clusters than in the field .",
    "overall fe enrichment originates in roughly comparable fractions from snia and snii for models where the relationship between snia and star formation is the same in clusters and the field . due to the long snia delay",
    ", outflow of fe from galaxies extends beyond the epoch of rapid star formation in order to be incorporated into the icm ; however , if the outflow is too prolonged , icm enrichment is too recent and in conflict with the mild observed fe evolution ( see discussion in  4.2 below ) .",
    "the implied snia rates at @xmath188 are somewhat at odds with observational limits for clusters , although the conflict is slightly weaker than inferred by @xcite ( see discussions in   4.3 and 4.6 below ) .",
    "unfortunately , there is as yet no data to provide a more definitive test by offering a comparison with the very high @xmath189 cluster snia rates predicted by these models ( see figure 7b ; maoz & gal - yam 2004 ) .",
    "additional models with snia rate histories that differ from those above , and that generally improve the match to the @xmath134 evolution in icm fe inferred from x - ray data , are constructed by ( 1 ) shortening the mean delay time in the kernel that transforms the star formation into the snia rate , ( 2 ) decreasing the initial star formation redshift in models where all stars form in rapid mode , or ( 3 ) reducing the number of snia explosions per unit mass of stars formed according to the number of intermediate mass ( @xmath2 ) stars whilst increasing the average snii fe yield to @xmath190 . the snia evolution in models of these type , with both rapid and normal star formation modes ,",

    "observations of rapid build - up of fe , and relatively low @xmath134 star formation and snia rates , in clusters are most readily explained in models where heavy element enrichment traces star formation .",
    "it is valuable to compare , in more detail , observed constraints on the chemical evolution of the universe outside of clusters with the standard model of  2 , i.e. a model with star formation history , stellar mass buildup , and type ii and type ia supernova rate histories as observed in the field , and with standard imf and snii and snia fe yields .",
    "such an examination yields insights into the chemical evolution of the universe , and reveals distinctions from that peculiar to galaxy clusters .",
    "comparisons for the abundance evolution to @xmath191 of the stellar , ism , and igm components are shown in figure 14 .",
    "allowing for an fe - to-@xmath136-element ratio as low as one - third , the igm abundance evolution in models with wind parameter greater than that corresponding to @xmath192 ( see middle curves in figure 4 and 5 ) is consistent with the @xmath193 ly@xmath136 forest lower limit @xcite , and with @xmath194 ly@xmath136 forest measurements @xcite .",
    "this implies that @xmath195% of the @xmath133 igm originates in galaxies and that the average stellar fe abundance at @xmath196 is @xmath197 relative to solar .",
    "the model fe abundance averaged over all baryons is also consistent with that measured in damped ly@xmath136 systems at @xmath198 ( argued by rao et al .",
    "2005 as dominating the mean cosmic metallicity in this redshift interval ) .",
    "the model ism abundances are consistent with the @xmath194 damped ly@xmath136 measurement if @xmath199 .",
    "the standard model ( without an altered imf , a temporally extended wind , or adjustment of relative normalizations , delays , or yields for supernovae ) is in general agreement with all @xmath135 non - cluster metallicity observations ( see , also , daigne et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "note that , at least for fe , there is no evidence of the missing metal problem summarized in , e.g. , @xcite : the models that assume the empirical @xmath200 star formation rate are in accord with the observations .",
    "there are two factors at play here .",
    "the primary one is that , although the fe yield per star averaged over a hubble time is indeed @xmath201 solar as generally assumed , the average yield prior to @xmath196 is only @xmath202 ( see figure 4 ) due to the delay in snia element production .",
    "the second factor is that the total ism density must exceed the value measured in damped ly@xmath136 systems , @xmath203 @xcite",
    ". the amount of potentially star - forming gas must be sufficient to account for the stars formed over @xmath204 : @xmath205 , taking mass return into account and assuming a standard imf .",
    "if one also accounts for the mass loss from the ism necessary to account for the metals observed in the igm , @xmath206 is inferred  more than three times the damped ly@xmath136 value .",
    "thus , the deficit in the detected amount of metals relative to expectations may be better characterized as a `` missing gas ( ism ) '' , rather than a `` missing metal , '' problem in the @xmath207 universe ( see , also , hopkins , rao , & turnshek 2005 ; prochaska , herbert - fort , and wolfe 2005 ) .",
    "conversely , there _ would _ be a missing metals problem if the variations considered above needed to explain cluster fe abundances and its evolution were applied to the field , as these were specifically introduced to produce a prodigious rapid enrichment .",
    "models where half the stars in the field were formed from a flat - imf , rapid star formation mode with either reduced snia delay , or increased snii yields and suppressed snia rate , overpredict @xmath196 fe abundances outside of clusters by @xmath208 . star formation is fundamentally different in clusters and the field ( see  4.4 , below ) .",
    "a full consideration of limits on departures of the standard model consistent with observations outside of clusters is beyond the scope of this work . given the above conclusions , it is perhaps surprising that field and cluster galaxy populations are not more distinct in terms of apparent ages , mass - to - light ratios , and abundances / abundance ratios  especially since spheroids dominate the stellar mass in both populations @xcite . a general prediction implied by the successful cluster models presented here is of higher fe abundances in cluster galaxies compared to the field ( even though a higher percentage of fe is locked up in galaxies in the field ",
    "@xmath209% , compared to @xmath210% in clusters ) .",
    "this effect is mitigated if metals are preferentially lost in outflows associated with the rapid star formation .",
    "i find that @xmath211% of the icm must originate in galaxies ( _ i.e _ the `` ism '' ) in order for the icm to be enriched in fe to 0.4 solar . the combination of ( 1 ) observations of the large amount of intracluster fe and its mild evolution since @xmath170 , ( 2 ) significant limits on the cluster snia rate since @xmath170 , and ( 3 ) the assumption that fe in the icm originates in galaxies that are known to form most of their stars at @xmath212 constrains the amount , epoch , and duration of matter and metal transport from cluster galaxies to the icm .",
    "thus observations of the evolution of icm enrichment provide a unique diagnostic of the nature of galactic winds associated with galaxy formation in a dense environment .",
    "since snii are more numerous than snia at all times for all models ( see figures 10ab , noting the respective scales ) , they are primarily responsible for the ejection of material from galaxies .",
    "the snii rate ( and , hence , snii fe enrichment ) is proportional to the star formation rate that steeply declines with redshift in cluster galaxies . because the mass loss rate as implemented in equation ( 21 ) is proportional _ both _ to the snii rate _ and _ to the mass in interstellar gas that decreases with time as it is consumed by star formation and",
    "also lost in galactic winds , it falls even more quickly than the star formation rate  and , more quickly than the interstellar medium is enriched .",
    "therefore a prompt phase of only modestly enriched mass injection into the icm ensues ; and , an additional , more prolonged , outflow ( see  3.1.1 ) must be invoked to transport the necessary fe into the icm  even if the snia delay time is reduced to 0.5 gyr .",
    "the sole exceptions to this requirement are models where snii fully dominate the icm fe enrichment that _ may _ be assumed to undergo prompt and very strong ( implying very high initial ism baryon fractions ) outflows , although scenarios with longer duration and milder outflows ( lower initial ism baryon fractions ) are also feasible ( see  3.1.5 ) .",
    "however , in models where the galactic outflow era is overly prolonged , the resulting delay in icm enrichment leads to an underprediction of the observed icm fe abundances at @xmath182 .",
    "such an additional extended phase of mass loss may be identified with ram - pressure stripping of galaxies rather than galactic winds , since simulations indicate that this is the dominant icm enrichment mechanism at @xmath134 @xcite . in the models presented here with extended outflow ,",
    "@xmath213% of the enrichment is due to this phase , compared to @xmath214% in the simulations .",
    "other possible avenues of prolonging the enrichment timescale include efficient winds from a galaxy subpopulation ( perhaps late - type or dwarf galaxies ) distinct from that responsible for the prompt outflow phase , or the suppression at early epochs in the conversion efficiency of supernovae energy to the kinetic energy of outflow ( e.g. , if it were more efficiently radiated as a result of a denser protogalactic environment ) .",
    "some , but not all , these mechanisms are particular to the rich cluster environment .      as shown in , e.g. , figure 10b the specific cluster snia rate is similar to that in the field out to @xmath170  the maximum redshift for which observational constraints are available in either environment .",
    "the inference , drawn above , that cluster star formation is significantly more efficient then implies  assuming universal snia fe yields  that snia must occur less frequently per unit mass of star formed , and/or predominantly explode at @xmath212 .",
    "figures 15ab revisit selected curves from figures 10b , 11b , 12b , and 13b , focusing on the @xmath215 region , and with the snia rates on a linear , rather than logarithmic , scale .",
    "the solid lines show models with standard snia normalizations and dtdfs .",
    "these are in marginal agreement with the observed cluster rate , and predict an order of magnitude increase just beyond the highest observed redshift bin .",
    "for the hybrid star formation models , decreasing the mean delay time or the number of snia per star formed according to the imf improves the match to the observations and results in less extreme behavior just beyond @xmath170 ( figure 15a ) , while simultaneously providing models that more precisely fit the icm fe data ( assuming , in the reduced - normalization models , that the snii fe yield is @xmath216 ) .",
    "in contrast , the snia rate in models where star formation exclusively occurs in rapid star formation mode generally decline too steeply at low redshift .",
    "there is independent justification for characterizing snia explosions associated with the rapid star formation in cluster galaxies with relatively short delay times .",
    "physically plausible double degenerate binary system progenitor models for snia with short delay times @xcite apparently find realization in regions of active star formation .",
    "evidence includes the measurement of higher snia rates in blue , relative to red , galaxies @xcite ; and , of higher rates in early - type galaxies when they are radio loud @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the observation of systematic differences in the characteristics of individual snia in elliptical and spiral galaxies ( della valle et al .",
    "2005 , garnavich & gallagher 2005 ) .",
    "@xcite also suggested that multiple snia types are required based on gradients in abundance ratios in the icm .",
    "high and persistent fe abundances , and fe - to-@xmath136 ratios , in the nuclei of galaxies hosting high redshift quasars also may indicate the presence of short - delay - time snia ( dietrich et al .",
    "2003 , maiolino et al .",
    "the successful models presented here with reduced snia delay times in the rapid star formation mode fit in well with these observations , providing a connection between star formation in local galaxies and the starbursts responsible for the elliptical galaxy stellar populations that dominate in rich clusters .",
    "i have shown that , if the snia per star formed in such models is determined by renormalizing the field value according to the relative number of @xmath2 stars , then the snii fe yield must exceed @xmath190 irregardless of the rapid mode mean snia delay time .",
    "however , one need not assume that progenitors of the two proposed subclasses of snia explode with the same likelihood @xcite .    even for a given progenitor model ,",
    "the distribution of delay times is sensitive to the distribution of orbital separations and mass ratios , and other factors , that depend on the initial mass function and galaxy age and metallicity in a complex and uncertain manner @xcite .",
    "moreover , the evidence for a 3 gyr mean delay for snia in the field has recently been questioned @xcite .",
    "given these considerations , in combination with uncertainties in the configuration of snia progenitors and explosion mechanism , one hesitates to suggest that the possibility that rapid star formation produce snia with shorter delay times casts doubt on the utility of snia as standard candles @xcite . in any case , since models where snii dominate fe enrichment are not ruled out , the evolution of intracluster fe does not constrain the snia delay time in a model - independent way . additional consideration of abundance ratios , and particularly their evolution , may be more definitive .      the baryon mass fraction in stars , @xmath217 and star - to - gas ratio , @xmath218 , in rich galaxy clusters",
    "may be estimated from several recent observational studies  although uncertainties persist .",
    "estimates of the total b - band mass - to - light ratio cluster around @xmath219 with a spread of @xmath220% @xcite , while the stellar mass - to - light ratio for a composite stellar population dominated by old stars to the degree appropriate for clusters is @xmath221 ( marinoni & hudson 2002 ; note , however , that this assumes a standard imf ) .",
    "this yields a mass fraction in stars of @xmath222 and @xmath223 ( assuming a cluster baryon bias factor of 0.9 )  roughly twice the universal ratios .",
    "similar ratios are derived from estimates of the total @xcite and stellar @xcite mass - to - light ratios where luminosities are measured in the k - band ( see , also , lin , mohr , & stanford 2003 ) .    the overall implications of these estimates of baryon mass fractions in stars for galaxy clusters that significantly exceed the universal value , and their connection to the problem of elemental abundances in the icm , may not be fully appreciated .",
    "the modeling approach presented here provides a quantitative perspective on some of the distinctions between star formation in the field and in clusters that complements studies of stellar populations . in models that successfully reproduce observed @xmath168 icm fe abundances , a significant fraction of the current mass in cluster galaxy stars forms in a rapid mode of star formation characterized by a top - heavy imf .",
    "the properties of the populations of lyman - break and submillimeter galaxies provide independent evidence for such an imf in the environments of rapid merger - driven star formation at high redshift of the kind that dominates in cluster galaxy progenitors @xcite . because of the higher return fraction in this component , more than two - thirds of the integrated star formation occurs in this mode , in accord with the large fraction of cluster stellar mass residing in early - type systems @xcite , and the high formation redshift @xcite and relatively small amount of continuing star formation @xcite in cluster galaxies .",
    "the inferred mass return fraction is @xmath224% , compared to 40% for a standard imf , implying that star formation would be 23 times more efficient than would be the case for a standard imf even assuming the same present - epoch stellar mass fraction .",
    "if the baryon fraction in stars at @xmath133 is indeed twice as high in clusters as in the field , and stars form in field galaxies with a predominantly standard imf , then star formation in clusters is _ 3  5 times more efficient_. likewise , @xmath225% of cluster baryons may be inferred to be cycled through stars ( this fraction is @xmath226% for the standard model ) . moreover , although the mass fraction of stars formed that is currently locked up in stellar remnants is @xmath227% , @xmath228% of the stellar mass _ today _ is in that , non - luminous , form ( compared to @xmath229% for a standard imf ) .",
    "these inferences have implications for constructing and interpreting population synthesis models of cluster galaxies , and for estimating their stellar mass - to - light ratios ( e.g. , zepf & silk 1996 ) , as well as for evaluating the extent and nature of `` overcooling '' and feedback in numerical simulations of cluster formation @xcite .",
    "it is crucial not to neglect mass return in inventories of the integrated star formation , especially in clusters .",
    "most , but not all , cluster star formation is required to occur at high redshift . as discussed in the previous section , models that provide the best simultaneous fits to the snia rate and icm fe evolution",
    "are those with hybrid star formation histories , since the snia rate steeply declines at @xmath134 in models where star formation exclusively originates in rapid mode .",
    "this may be taken as an indication that the finite ( if small ) low - redshift cluster snia rates imply a non - negligible degree of relatively recent star formation activity in cluster galaxies . while the butcher - omeler effect indicates that recent epoch star formation is suppressed relative to the field by a factor of @xmath208 in rich cluster cores , star formation persists outside of the core where late - type galaxies are more common @xcite . in any case , since the estimated low-@xmath230 cluster snia rate is only @xmath231 above 0 , it is likely that one could construct hybrid - sfh models with a lower level of recent ( @xmath232  considering the delay in snia enrichment ) star formation than in those presented here that would be equally successful  particularly if one considers a snia delay time distribution function that falls off less steeply at long delays than the gaussian function considered here .",
    "in fact , if there are two subpopulations of snia , with dtdfs centered on short ( @xmath233 yr ) and long ( @xmath234 yr ) delays , respectively , an exponential distribution for the long - delay snia provides a better fit to the observed field snia rate history @xcite .      in the models that , simultaneously , best match the icm fe abundance and snia rate evolution , icm enrichment traces star formation via either a combination of snii and short - time - delay snia ( 2h1.05wxst1 , 2h1.05wxst2 ; figure 11 ) , or domination by snii ( 2h1.05wxsn , 2h1.05wxstn ; figure 13 ) . for the former ,",
    "the fraction of stars in snia progenitors is assumed to be the same as for a standard imf , even though the total fraction of stars in the @xmath2 range is lower . under the ira ,",

    "evidently , snia synthesize a significant fraction of cluster fe only in models characterized by a flat imf , and with @xmath92 maintained at its value deduced in the field .",
    "moreover , the snia fe yield must be high . while recent multi - dimensional simulations @xcite predict lower yields , phenomenological studies continue to favor higher values of @xmath246 @xcite .    similarly , the integrated snii fe enrichment per baryon , assuming ira , is @xmath247 figures 16ab also include the computation , without assuming the ira , of @xmath248 for the parameters listed above and @xmath249 , as well as the summed sn fe enrichment per baryon .",
    "in addition , the local imf slope , and range of @xmath250 estimated above , are indicated .",
    "these figures emphasize the robustness of the requirement for a flat imf ( unless @xmath251 ) , and illustrate the challenge in producing sufficient fe in the hybrid star formation models ( that best match the observed cluster snia evolution ) if the snia progenitor probability for stars in the @xmath2 range is universal .",
    "the fe enrichment per baryon for such models plateaus at @xmath252 , explaining why @xmath253 ( or greater ) is favored if @xmath92 is scaled in this manner (  3.1.5 ) .    to summarize , the observed frequency of snia in clusters ( or in the universe as a whole ) is insufficient to account for cluster fe enrichment .",
    "therefore , either a separate class of prompt , high fe yield snia that initiate at high redshift explode with an incidence per star formed that exceeds what one expects based on the field value and relative number of @xmath2 stars , or the shortfall is made up by snii .",
    "these snii must primarily originate from rapid star formation with a flat imf , and yield an average of @xmath216 of fe .",
    "if this is the case , snii dominate cluster enrichment , implying a snii - like pattern of elemental abundances in the icm and in the oldest cluster galaxies .",
    "this pattern is fixed at high redshift , unlike its counterpart in field galaxies where fe enrichment is delayed .",
    "enhanced numbers of snii , and likely gamma - ray bursts as well , in clusters at @xmath254 are then expected .",
    "@xcite reached similar conclusions with regard to the inadequacy of snia , and the likely need for a top - heavy imf , to account for icm fe .",
    "their approach was essentially as follows .",
    "they calculated the number of snia required to make up the fe deficit left after subtracting the snii contribution  assuming a salpeter imf ( @xmath255 )  from what is observed at @xmath133 .",
    "they then distribute those snia in redshift according to a particular formation epoch @xmath83 and snia delay time distribution  assuming that all stars formed in a burst at @xmath105  for comparison with the cluster snia rate evolution derived from their observations . in agreement with the present work ,",
    "they find that the specific incidence of snia progenitors required exceeds the field value by an order of magnitude . assumptions in their analysis that differ from the present one include ( 1 ) @xmath256 or 3 , ( 2 ) a pure instantaneous burst , ( 3 ) a lower stellar mass - to - light ratio ( implicitly ) , ( 4 ) neglect of the difference between the mass of stars formed over a hubble time and that measured at @xmath133 . in addition , @xcite adopt a snia delay time distribution that is both more sharply peaked and with a more prominent tail to long delays .",
    "nevertheless , their results are broadly consistent with those presented here in marginally allowing scenarios where @xmath257 and the mean delay time is 3 gyr ( figure 12 ) .",
    "the present study goes further in explicitly considering a range of imfs and possible star formation and outflow histories to calculate the evolution of icm enrichment , and in concluding that models with more prompt enrichment more accurately predict the flat icm fe evolution that is observed .",
    "@xcite analyzed the cluster metal inventory at @xmath133 .",
    "an instantaneous burst of star formation was assumed , with self - consistent treatment of the stellar mass - to - light ratio and mass return , although the stellar fe abundance was put in by hand . since chemical evolution",
    "is not modeled , the observed icm fe evolution is not utilized to evaluate scenarios .",
    "models with top - heavy imfs or non - standard snia parameters were not explicitly considered .",
    "nevertheless , their rejection of a standard imf is robust and in agreement with the conclusions presented here .",
    "@xcite utilized n - body simulations in a @xmath258cdm universe , conjoined with a parameterized semi - analytic treatment of astrophysical processes in the baryonic component such as cooling , star formation , feedback , and galactic winds , to simulate the chemical evolution of the igm and the icm .",
    "yields appropriate to a top - heavy imf are adopted , although mass return and the photometric properties of galaxies were computed for a salpeter imf . in agreement with the results of this work , they found that in models tuned to reproduce the observational properties of @xmath133 galaxies , icm enrichment was invariably concentrated to high redshifts  a direct result of the @xmath193 peak in the star formation rate and the assumption of instantaneous recycling .",
    "the semi - analytic models of nagashima et al .",
    "( 2005a ) included a more detailed treatment of chemical evolution , and adopted some of the enhancements listed in  4.7 below , such as a two - phase ism and separate treatment of galaxy disk and bulge components .",
    "they fixed the disk and bulge imfs , with the latter characterized by a monotonic flat slope ( thus maximizing the snii / snia ratio in this population ) , and also adopt a single prescription for computing the snia rate .",
    "neither the star formation , nor the snia , rate histories were shown or directly compared to observations ; however , the latter seems to have a mean delay intermediate between those most often considered here ( _ i.e. _ @xmath259 , 3 gyr ) . yet",
    "again , it was concluded that a top - heavy imf ( corresponding to @xmath260 ) is required to produce sufficient metals  an inference further supported by comparing fe - to-@xmath136-element ratios in individual elliptical galaxies with those in galaxy formation simulations @xcite .",
    "icm fe enrichment of the icm occurs early in their models , as observed , with @xmath136-element enrichment ensuing even more promptly .",
    "contrary to the results of the present investigation , and those described above , @xcite concluded that icm fe can be accounted for by enrichment from star formation with a salpeter imf and snia with delay time and normalization as found in the field by @xcite and @xcite  similar to model 1n2.3 in the present work that was dismissed as failing to produce adequate fe .",
    "@xcite acknowledged , however , that not enough stars are observed ( via @xmath261 ) for this scenario to be fully coherent .",
    "this internal inconsistency can be clarified as follows .",
    "the supernova parameters adopted in @xcite result in an fe yield of @xmath262 per solar mass of star formation compared to the estimated total cluster fe mass of @xmath263 per solar mass of icm  _",
    "i.e. _ a mass ratio of stars - formed to gas of 0.82 , or a ratio of stars formed to stars observed today of 6.3 ( for a present - day cluster star - to - gas ratio of 0.12 ) is implied .",
    "the implied return fraction of 0.84 is grossly inconsistent with the initial assumption of a salpeter imf .",
    "one might be troubled by the high initial ism baryon fractions , and the high resulting galactic fe abundances , in models that best explain the icm fe and snia observations .",
    "the need for a reservoir to provide for the copious ensuing star formation ( no additional sources of star - forming gas  via , e.g. , infall  are subsequently introduced ) , and to soak up the newly synthesized metals to be ejected into the igm drives the requirement for the former . in the context of the simple models constructed here , the latter is an inevitable consequence of the early epoch for most star formation and the observationally - driven requirement for early enrichment .",
    "a number of refinements that may prove fruitful in follow - up studies , some of which are relevant to these issues , may be considered .    in the models presented here ,",
    "star formation and igm - enriching outflows originate in the same single - component ism",
    ". one may subdivide the ism into hot and cold phases , with stars exclusively forming from the latter and outflows exclusively originating in the former .",
    "the two phases can exchange mass and be distinctly enriched by supernovae .",
    "one may alternatively , or additionally , include `` bias '' parameters to ensure that outflowing and/or star - forming gas is preferentially metal - enriched relative to the average in the ism .",
    "these all may affect the relationship between the required duration of galactic outflows and the amount of metals locked up in stars .",
    "likewise , requirements on the magnitude and timing of outflows may be altered by explicitly considering ( re)accretion of igm onto galaxies .",
    "outflows associated with snii and snia may be `` decoupled '' by associating distinct normalizations with each type .",
    "the number of components may be further expanded in order to , e.g , allow for separate treatment of bulges and disks within the stellar component as regards star formation rate , imf , snia normalization and delay time distribution , outflows / inflows , etc .",
    " rather than the less physically motivated division into `` field - like '' and `` cluster - enhancement '' components .",
    "this additional level of detail clarifies the field / cluster dichotomy , and would enable a more detailed evaluation of the star formation histories in the models .    a more sophisticated treatment of supernovae could include yields that depend on progenitor mass , thus introducing an imf - dependence for average yields , or on the metallicity of the progenitor population . these are often implemented for snii , but could be considered for snia as well , as could a metal dependence of the number of snia per star formed .",
    "a less empirical treatment of star formation could be implemented in a global manner by specifying an explicit , parameterized dependence on total ism mass density constrained by observations of field star formation rates and the distinct stellar inventories in clusters and in the field .",
    "an explicit metallicity - dependent imf could be considered .",
    "the formation and evolution of binary star systems may be distinctly and explicitly traced , and granted a role in determining the snia rate .",
    "population iii enrichment may be more carefully considered , especially in relation to metal build - up at high - redshift .",
    "the overall impact of such a component is generally considered minor in the igm out to relatively high redshift ( yoshida , bromm & hernquist 2004 ; norman , oshea , & paschos 2004 ; but , see salvaterra & ferrara 2003 ) , but may be of enhanced significance in clusters @xcite .",
    "finally , one should consider the abundance evolution of additional elements , such as o , mg , and si to further constrain the combination of imf , relative snii / snia normalization , and outflow parameters , as well as the average yields themselves .",
    "while the above considerations indicate limitations of the present work , the physically and observationally motivated , self - consistent models constructed here reveal a number of implications and puzzles . by virtue of the simplicity and limited number of free model parameters in this approach",
    ", one can draw conclusions and identify persistent paradoxes  summarized in the section that follows  that are qualitatively model - independent and easily traced to particular phenomenon or assumptions .",
    "i constructed models for the coupled mass density and fe abundance evolution of stars , interstellar ( potentially star - forming ) gas , and intergalactic ( inert ) gas in a closed box , with application to the universe as a whole and extension to the special environments of rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "i focused on fe because of its power as a diagnostic of snia astrophysics and the unmatched constraints provided by recent observations of the evolution of the snia rate and icm fe abundance .",
    "i adopted empirically based source terms to mitigate the limitations in our understanding of star formation and the physics and astrophysics of supernova explosions .",
    "i considered the effects of varying the star formation rate history , initial mass function , snii fe yields , snia rate normalization and distribution of delay times , and strength and duration of galactic outflow on field and cluster observables .",
    "confrontation of models with observations of the three components in both environments , and over a range in redshift , constrain the mechanisms , and highlight the distinctions , of metal enrichment in the field and in clusters that depend on the physical characteristics of star formation and snia explosions .",
    "the average star formation history in the universe is measured out to redshift @xmath264 @xcite , and a snia delay time distribution function derived from a comparison with the snia rate history to @xmath212 .",
    "the results of direct application of these functions  assuming a standard imf , and standard snia and snii fe yields  to chemical evolutionary models are consistent with metallicities measured in damped ly@xmath136 systems out to @xmath265 and in the igm to @xmath266 .",
    "a standard imf also correctly predicts measurements of the buildup of stellar mass over cosmic time , and estimated snii rates to @xmath188 .",
    "a careful accounting of star formation , stellar mass return , and galactic winds implies that the ism density is @xmath3 times that in damped ly@xmath136 systems ( dlas ) at @xmath196 , supporting suggestions that the `` missing metal '' problem is actually a `` missing gas '' problem  _",
    "i.e. _ that there is more potentially star - forming gas than currently measured in dlas .",
    "the delay in snia enrichment implies that less than 10% of the fe in field galaxies was in place at @xmath267 and that the fe yield per star formed at that redshift was approximately half the current value .",
    "one expects a negative correlation of the fe - to-@xmath136 elemental abundance ratio with stellar population age .",
    "although some field star formation may proceed with a flat imf @xcite , drastic departures from the standard model presented here , unless constructed in a highly contrived manner , are ruled out by observations and their mutual consistency within the standard framework .",
    "the amount of fe per baryon measured in clusters exceeds that predicted by the successful and internally consistent field model described above by more than a factor of four . and",
    "yet , surveys fail to detect supernovae  in particular snia that most efficiently synthesize fe  in sufficient numbers to account for this hyper - enrichment . in this paper",
    "i presented , and evaluated the plausibility and implications of , possible resolutions to this now well - established ( portinari et al .",
    "2005 , and references therein ) paradox .",
    "clusters are typically inferred to have roughly twice the stellar mass fraction as in the field , and cluster galaxies are believed to form stars more rapidly . however , these factors are insufficient ( although the latter is necessary ) for reproducing the observed fe abundance and its mild evolution since @xmath188 .",
    "fe must be synthesized in abundance at an early epoch , and must be efficiently transported from galaxies to the icm .",
    "therefore , a significant fraction of star formation must proceed rapidly with a top - heavy imf ( see , also , finoguenov , burkert , & bhringer 2003 ) .",
    "star formation is @xmath268 times more efficient in rich clusters than in the field , mitigating the overcooling problem in numerical cluster simulations .",
    "both the fraction of baryons cycled through stars , and the fraction of the total present - day stellar mass in the form of stellar remnants , are substantially greater in clusters than in the field . assuming that metals are well - mixed in the ism before ejection , @xmath269% of the icm must originate in galaxies ( see , also , moretti et al .",
    "2003 ) , with the lower values generally associated with galactic outflows assumed to continue for longer durations .",
    "confirming and extending the conclusions drawn by previous studies ( see  4.6 ) , i demonstrated that the observed mild amount of evolution in fe is most accurately reproduced in models where the enrichment tracks star formation , implying that synthesis of cluster fe was dominated by snii ( if the snia rate normalization is scaled down from its value in the field according to the relative number of @xmath2 stars ) and/or snia with short delay times whose progenitors originated during a phase of rapid , top - heavy star formation ( see , also , scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ) . in the former , @xmath1 per snii is required ; in the latter @xmath270 of fe from snia per star formed is required .",
    "the best matches to the low observed @xmath134 cluster snia rates are reproduced in models where cluster star formation does not exclusively occur at high redshift , but continues to at least @xmath271 .",
    "this is a more prolonged history of star formation than inferred in the central regions of rich clusters , and is contingent on the assumption of a steep decline in the snia delay time distribution function beyond 3 gyr .",
    "observations of high fe content in the icm and its persistence to @xmath170 , in combination with constraints on snia enrichment from rates measured to similar redshifts , confirms the rapid and efficient nature of star formation in galactic spheroids in clusters , and provides overwhelming evidence that this star formation was characterized by a top - heavy imf that produced type ia less efficiently and/or with shorter delay times ( on average ) than in field galaxies .",
    "rich galaxy clusters are , indeed , special environments and should only be treated as `` fair samples of the universe '' in a limited and well - defined context .",

    "<S> the nature of star formation and type ia supernovae ( snia ) in galaxies in the field and in rich galaxy clusters are contrasted by juxtaposing the build - up of heavy metals in the universe inferred from observed star formation and supernovae rate histories with data on the evolution of fe abundances in the intracluster medium ( icm ) . </S>",
    "<S> models for the chemical evolution of fe in these environments are constructed , subject to observational constraints , for this purpose . </S>",
    "<S> while models with a mean delay for snia of 3 gyr and standard initial mass function ( imf ) are consistent with observations in the field , cluster fe enrichment immediately tracks a rapid , top - heavy phase of star formation  </S>",
    "<S> although transport of fe into the icm may be more prolonged and star formation likely continues to redshifts @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the source of this prompt enrichment is type ii supernovae ( snii ) yielding @xmath1 per explosion ( if the snia rate normalization is scaled down from its value in the field according to the relative number of candidate progenitor stars in the @xmath2 range ) and/or snia explosions with short delay times associated with the rapid star formation mode . </S>",
    "<S> star formation is @xmath3 times more efficient in rich clusters than in the field , mitigating the overcooling problem in numerical cluster simulations . </S>",
    "<S> both the fraction of baryons cycled through stars , and the fraction of the total present - day stellar mass in the form of stellar remnants , are substantially greater in clusters than in the field . </S>"
