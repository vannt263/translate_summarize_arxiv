    "the rptin compounds ( r = y , la - sm , gd - lu ) have been reported to crystallize in the zrnial hexagonal structure@xcite , space group _ p@xmath12",
    "m _ , with the rare earth in orthorhombic point symmetry , whereas the r = eu member of this series forms in an orthorhombic tinisi - type structure@xcite ( space group _ pnma _ ) .",
    "magnetic and transport measurements on some of these materials revealed a variety of physical properties across the series : ceptin@xcite and ybptin@xcite appear to be dense kondo systems , with the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath11 larger than 500 mj / mol k@xmath12 , and 430 mj / mol k@xmath12 respectively ; no magnetic order was observed in the former compound down to 60 mk@xcite , whereas the latter appears to order antiferromagnetically below 3.4 k@xcite . in tbptin@xcite the antiferromagnetic nature of the magnetic order below 50 k was indirectly suggested by the metamagnetic transitions observed in the m(h ) data below this temperature .",
    "watson _ _ et al.__@xcite have also reported that the r = gd and dy members of this series have ferromagnetic ground states , with t@xmath13 = 89 k , and 38 k respectively , with reduced values of both the effective and the saturated moments of these two compounds .",
    "whereas for the dy system , the disagreement with the respective theoretical values could be attributed to crystal electric field cef effects , it was unclear what was causing it in gdptin .",
    "cef effects are also apparent in the magnetization measurements on prptin down to t = 1.7 k , which , together with the resistivity data@xcite suggest a possible ferromagnetic transition at lower temperatures . similar data on smptin are indicative of ferromagnetic ordering in this compound below t@xmath14 25 k.    we recently presented detailed magnetization and transport measurements on single crystals of tbptin@xcite : anisotropic low - field susceptibility and specific heat measurements confirm the antiferromagnetic ground state , with t@xmath15 = 46 k , slightly different than the previously reported value@xcite ; below the ordering temperature , complex metamagnetism is revealed by magnetization measurements with applied field in the basal plane . whereas from the high - temperature inverse susceptibility we obtained an effective moment @xmath16/tb@xmath17 , close to the theoretical value @xmath18 , the high - field magnetization data yielded values only up to @xmath19/tb@xmath17 , much smaller than the theoretical saturated moment of @xmath20 . in order to explain the reduced magnetization values , as well as the angular dependence of the metamagnetic properties",
    ", we proposed a _ three co - planar ising - like systems model _ , which took into account the orthorhombic point symmetry of the rare earth ions in the hexagonal unit cell of the rptin compounds@xcite .",
    "within such a model , for applied magnetic fields far smaller than the cef splitting energy , for tbptin one expects a crystal field limited saturated paramagnetic cl - spm state equal to @xmath21 .    in view of these existing magnetization and transport data ,",
    "the magnetic ordering in the heavy rare earth members of the rptin series was somewhat intriguing : whereas for gdptin and dyptin , ferromagnetic ground states were reported , the intermediate r = tb member appears to order antiferromagnetically , which is a rather unusual discontinuity for a magnetically ordering local moment series .    in the present work we are trying to address this problem , and",
    "also extend the characterization of the physical properties to all the heavy rptin systems ( _ i.e. _ , for r = y , gd - lu ) .",
    "having been able to grow single crystals for all of these compounds , we have the possibility of determining the effect of the cef anisotropy on their magnetic properties , more so than in the previous studies on polycrystalline samples .",
    "as we shall see , the hexagonal crystal structure of these compounds , with three r ions in the unit cell occupying unique orthorhombic point symmetry sites , is of crucial importance in explaining the moment configurations and magnetic ordering in the rptin materials described here .    in presenting our data",
    ", we will start with the non - magnetic members of the rptin series , r = y and lu ; then we will continue with the magnetic ones ( r = gd - tm ) , characterizing each of the compounds by temperature- and field - dependent magnetization , as well as zero - field specific heat measurements . a brief description of the previously reported@xcite heavy fermion compound ybptin is also included , our measurements being performed , as with all the other r compounds , on solution - grown single crystals .",
    "next , we will briefly present the model for the magnetic moment configuration , characterizing the extremely planar tbptin compound ( which is described in detail by morosan _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite ) ; a more generalized version of this model , extended to three dimensions , will then be used to describe the magnetism in the other magnetic compounds except ybptin .",
    "we will conclude by emphasizing the possibility of generalizing our _ three co - planar ising - like systems model _ to a three dimensional one , which could potentially describe hexagonal systems with orthorhombic point symmetry of the rare earth site beyond the rptin series .",
    "directions for further experiments which could potentially probe the validity of our assumed model will also be discussed .",
    "single crystals of rptin ( r = y , gd - lu ) were grown out of high - temperature ternary solution@xcite .",
    "initial concentrations used were typically r@xmath8pt@xmath8in@xmath22 , with @xmath23 , and the resulting crystals were well - formed hexagonal rods .",
    "the in - rich self - flux was used because it lowers the liquid - solidus surface of primary solidification for rptin , and also introduces no new elements into the melt . after placing the constituent elements in alumina crucibles ,",
    "the crucibles were sealed in quartz ampoules under partial argon pressure . in most cases the ampoules",
    "were initially heated up to @xmath24 c , and then slowly cooled down to @xmath25 c , over 50 to 100 hours .",
    "subsequently , the excess liquid solution was decanted , and the resulting hexagonal rods were , if necessary , quickly etched in hcl to remove residual flux from the surface .",
    "higher decanting temperatures ( _ i.e. _ , above @xmath26 c ) were necessary for r = y , gd and er , whereas in the case of tmptin the temperature interval for which best crystals were obtained was lower ( between @xmath27 c to @xmath28 c ) . in some cases , the hexagonal rods had hollow channels in the center , sometimes with flux inclusions .",
    "we succeeded in optimizing the growth of tbptin by using faster cooling rates ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath29 c / 50h ) ; this yielded only well - formed , full , hexagonal rods , whereas when slowing down the cooling process hollow crystals were obtained together with full , smaller ones .",
    "slight modifications of the initial concentrations and/or growth profiles for dy , ho or er did nt totally eliminate the formation of hollow rods , but @xmath30 dense samples could easily be found . for all our measurements ,",
    "carefully chosen , well - formed single crystals were used , so as to avoid possible mass errors on hollow rods to propagate into our data .    a drastic modification of the growth procedure needed to be made for ybptin : a ternary solution with initial composition yb@xmath31pt@xmath32in@xmath33 was sealed in a 3-cap ta crucible@xcite , and slow - cooled from @xmath34 c to @xmath26 c over @xmath35 hours , resulting in well - formed hexagonal rods .    to confirm the crystal structure of the rptin compounds ( r = y , gd - lu ) , room temperature powder x - ray measurements were performed , using cu k@xmath36 radiation .",
    "a typical pattern is shown in fig.[f02 ] for tbptin .",
    "all detected peaks were indexed using the rietica rietveld refinement program , with the p@xmath12 m space group and lattice parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and no secondary phases were detected . in fig.[f03 ] , the volume and the dimensions of the unit cell across the series are shown as a function of the r@xmath17 ionic radii .",
    "all values shown in this figure are calculated from high angle / high intensity peaks , _ i.e. _ , using the ( 231 ) and ( 032 ) peaks , together with the corresponding error bars which also encompass the values yielded by the rietica refinement .",
    "the unit cell volume ( fig.[f03]a ) generally follows the expected lanthanide contraction@xcite ( as shown by the dotted line ) , as does the _ c _ lattice parameter ( fig.[f03]b ) , whereas an apparent non - monotonic change of the _ a _ parameter is noticeable in fig.[f03]c .",
    "however , the r = tm and yb volumes appear to deviate slightly from the monotonic decrease across the series ; whereas this could indicate , at least for r = yb , a trend toward valence @xmath39 for the rare earth ions , we shall see that the magnetic measurements are consistent with the presence of magnetism in the respective compounds , associated with trivalent r ions .",
    "additional single crystal x - ray measurements were performed on the r = tb , tm and yb members of the series ; these data indicated a small ( _ i.e. _ , less than @xmath40 ) deficient occupancy of one of the two pt sites in the unit cell of the r = yb system , leading to a stoichiometry closest to ybpt@xmath41 in . the analogous measurements on tbptin and tmptin crystals indicated full occupancy on all crystallographic sites in these compounds .",
    "the lattice parameters from single crystal x - ray data for all three compounds are consistent with the powder values in fig.[f03 ] .",
    "magnetic measurements were performed in a quantum design magnetic properties measurement system ( mpms ) squid magnetometer ( t = 1.8 - 350 k , h@xmath42 = 55 kg ) .",
    "additional measurements up to 140 kg were also taken for tbptin , using an extraction magnetometer in a quantum design physical properties measurement system ( ppms ) .",
    "we measured anisotropic field and temperature dependent magnetization for all compounds , having the applied field @xmath43 or @xmath44 , with arbitrary orientation of the field within the basal plane unless otherwise specified .",
    "the corresponding susceptibilities were calculated as @xmath45 , whereas the polycrystalline average susceptibility was estimated to be    @xmath46 ,    or , when in - plane anisotropic measurements were available ( _ i.e. _ , for the external field @xmath47 $ ] and @xmath48 $ ] ) ,    @xmath49}~+~\\chi_{[120]}~+~\\chi_{[001]})$ ] .",
    "curie - weiss behavior of the anisotropic susceptibilities was observed for all magnetic compounds , such that @xmath50 .",
    "thus from the high - temperature linear inverse susceptibilities we were able to determine both the effective moment @xmath51 ( and compare it with the expected free ion value ) and the anisotropic weiss temperatures @xmath52 for each compound .",
    "additional angular dependent magnetization measurements have been performed on the hoptin compound , as well as on the corresponding dilution with non - magnetic y@xmath17 ions on the ho site , ho@xmath8y@xmath9ptin ( x@xmath53 ) . for these measurements ,",
    "the angular position of the samples was controlled by a specially modified mpms sample holder which allowed for the rotation of the sample so that either the [ 001 ] , [ 100 ] or [ 120]-axis stayed perpendicular to the applied magnetic field .",
    "torque on the rotor was avoided by using small mass samples for the rotation measurements , and these data were subsequently calibrated with the two directions m(h ) data on larger mass samples , as described in more detail by morosan _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite .",
    "heat capacity measurements were made in the same quantum design ppms system .",
    "for each measurement , the sample holder and grease background data , taken separately , were later subtracted from the sample response .",
    "for the antiferromagnetic members of the series ( r = tb and tm ) , we inferred the transition temperatures ( nel temperature or spin reorientation temperatures ) as determined from @xmath54 @xcite and @xmath55 plots . in the ferromagnetic rptin compounds , unusually broad peaks marked the ordering in the specific heat data .",
    "thus the onset of the transition was chosen as the curie temperature @xmath56 ( _ i.e. _ , the t value for which an increase of the specific heat data occurs as the temperature is lowered through the phase transition ) .",
    "we are characterizing each compound by anisotropic magnetization and specific heat measurements , starting with the non - magnetic yptin and luptin members of the series . next the magnetic rptin",
    "will be introduced , for r = gd to tm . for each",
    ", we will emphasize the nature of the ordered state together with the ordering temperatures , as well as the high field , anisotropic magnetization data , as these provide key values in our discussion and analysis following the data presentation .",
    "lastly , similar data on ybptin is presented , with a note that a more detailed analysis of the heavy fermion character of this compound is the subject of a separate investigation@xcite .",
    "the anisotropic susceptibilities of the two members of the rptin series with non - magnetic r ion ( r = y and lu ) are very small and basically temperature - independent . however , the dominant terms in the susceptibility data seem quite different for the two compounds , as the average high - temperature values are positive in the case of yptin ( around @xmath57 emu / mol for @xmath44 , and @xmath58 emu / mol for @xmath43 ) , and negative for luptin ( around @xmath59 emu / mol for @xmath44 , and @xmath60 emu / mol for @xmath43 ) .",
    "the field - dependent magnetization values for both compounds are extremely small , as expected for non - magnetic r compounds .",
    "heat capacity measurements in zero applied field were performed for the two systems , for @xmath61 k. as seen in fig .",
    "[ f04 ] , they have similar temperature dependencies ; the higher molecular weight for luptin ( and consequently the expected lower debye temperature ) could explain the values of the specific heat data being larger for this compound than for yptin .",
    "however , this does not account for the big entropy difference for these two systems ( upper inset ) .",
    "this estimated entropy difference has a fairly large value @xmath62 around 67 k , which , as we shall see , is the magnetic ordering temperature for gdptin .",
    "( the entropy difference is still considerably large when the measured specific heat data are scaled by their molecular weights , according to the debye model . ) consequently , no meaningful magnetic specific heat estimates can be made for the magnetic rptin compounds using either the r = y or lu compounds as the non - magnetic analogues .",
    "* gdptin * + the anisotropic @xmath63 data for gdptin , together with the polycrystalline average , are shown in fig.[f05 ] .",
    "the inset presents the low - temperature @xmath45 data for low applied field ( h @xmath64 g ) , measured on warming up after either zero - field cooling zfc ( symbols ) or field cooling fc ( solid lines ) of the sample .",
    "the paramagnetic susceptibility shows curie - weiss behavior @xmath65 above @xmath66 k. @xmath52 represents the weiss temperature , which can be determined from the linear fit of the high - temperature inverse susceptibility , and the values corresponding to the two orientations of the field , as well as the one for the polycrystalline average , are listed in table 1 .",
    "the inverse susceptibility data appear slightly anisotropic , contrary to the expected isotropic paramagnetic state for a gd compound .",
    "this is possibly caused by the dominant anisotropic interaction in a pure s - state ( _ i.e. _ , l = 0 ) compound@xcite , also consistent with the different anisotropic weiss temperatures for this gd system ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the effective moment value determined from the linear region in the inverse average susceptibility is @xmath67 , comparable to the theoretical value of @xmath68 for the gd@xmath17 ions .",
    "the field dependent magnetization data ( fig.[f07 ] ) appears to indicate ferromagnetic ordering along the _ c_-axis .",
    "measurements performed for both increasing and decreasing applied field reveal hysteresis loops for both h parallel and perpendicular to the _ c_-axis . at @xmath69 kg , the magnetization saturates in both directions around the expected @xmath70 gd@xmath17 value .",
    "as the increase of the axial magnetization with field ( _ i.e. _ , for @xmath43 ) is much faster than for @xmath71 , we are led to believe that the ferromagnetic exchange interaction favors moments alignment along the _ c_-axis .",
    "there is significant difference between the zfc and the fc data in the ordered state for both @xmath44 and @xmath43 , with @xmath4 in the low - temperature paramagnetic state ( inset fig.[f05 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the magnetic moments ordering ferromagnetically along the _",
    "c_-axis below the irreversibility temperature @xmath72 k , as it has already been reported on polycrystalline samples by watson _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "the irreversibility temperature for @xmath44 is slightly different ( @xmath73 k ) .",
    "specific heat data is needed to determine the magnetic ordering temperature , and using an on - set criterion ( fig.[f06 ] ) , the curie temperature was determined to be @xmath74 k , larger than the anisotropic @xmath75 values . in turn , this value is significantly lower than the previously reported ordering temperature for the polycrystalline samples@xcite .",
    "we believe that the discrepancies in the ordering temperature estimates are due to the different criteria used for determining @xmath56 , as well as to the different types of samples used in the measurements , with the single crystal data possibly being more accurate .",

    "the inverse average susceptibility becomes linear , indicating curie - weiss like behavior .",

    "this is not entirely surprising , given the different flux growth process ( a low pt - concentration used in the initial yb@xmath31pt@xmath32in@xmath33 solution ) .",
    "consequently the r = yb compound is excluded from the following discussion .",
    "a more complete analysis of the thermodynamic and transport properties of this material is currently the subject of a different study@xcite .",
    "the magnetic rptin compounds that we investigate here appear to order magnetically below @xmath134 k. as can be seen in fig.[f25 ] , their ordering temperatures @xmath135 scale fairly well with the de gennes factor @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is the land g - factor , and j is the total angular momentum of the r@xmath17 ion hund s rule ground state . whereas this suggests that the rkky interaction between the conduction electrons and the local magnetic moments gives rise to the long - range magnetic order , slight departures from linearity , similar to those seen for other rare earth - series@xcite , are due to the extremely simplified assumptions associated with the de gennes scaling .",
    "the scaling is apparently unaffected by the curious switching from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic ordering across the rptin series , which appears to be correlated with a change in the anisotropy , such that , in the low - t paramagnetic state , @xmath4 for the ferromagnetic compounds , and @xmath3 for the antiferromagnetic ones . at first , this may seem inconsistent with de gennes scaling , which would indicate similar ordering mechanisms for all rptin compounds , r = gd - tm . as we shall see , we believe that , because of their fe@xmath5p - type hexagonal structure , with three r ions sitting at orthorhombic point symmetry sites , strong cef effects constrain the local magnetic moments in r = tb - tm to equivalent non - collinear easy - axes .",
    "this results in ( i ) anisotropic paramagnetic magnetization , and ( ii ) crystal field limited saturated paramagnetic cl - spm states with magnetization values well below the corresponding free ion saturated moments .",
    "we have already modelled the effects of strong crystal electric fields on the fe@xmath5p - type crystal structure , for the case of the extremely planar r = tb member of the rptin series and the similar r = tm member of the ragge series , using the _ _ three co - planar ising - like systems model__@xcite : having three rare earths in orthorhombic point symmetry , the hexagonal symmetry of the unit cell was achieved by constraining the local moments to three equivalent co - planar directions , @xmath6 away from each other . in allowing both",
    "the `` up '' and `` down '' positions ( _ i.e. _ , ising - like ) for each of the three magnetic moments , the antiferromagnetic ground state was , in the simplest case , realized by a ( @xmath138 ) moment configuration ( fig.[f26]a ) ; upon increasing the applied magnetic field within the basal plane , a number of metamagnetic states occurred , showing simple dependencies of the critical fields @xmath139 and the locally saturated magnetizations @xmath140 on the angle @xmath141 between the direction of the field and the easy axis ( see fig.13 and related discussion by morosan _ _ et al.__@xcite ) .",
    "when all the moments are in their `` up '' positions ( @xmath142 ) , a crystal field limited saturated paramagnetic cl - spm state is reached ( fig.[f26]b ) ; the expected magnetization value is    @xmath143tb@xmath144tb@xmath114 or @xmath145 ,    consistent with the easy - axis measured data ( full circles ) shown in fig.[f10 ] .",
    "we thus see that the aforementioned _ three co - planar ising - like systems model _ explains how the measured magnetization values can be much smaller than the theoretical saturated value of @xmath120 for the tb@xmath17 ions .",
    "by contrast , the gdptin does nt exhibit such reduced values of the magnetization for high applied fields ( fig.[f07 ] ) , given that the gd@xmath17 ions are in a symmetric @xmath146 state , and thus the cef effects are minimal : for @xmath43 ( crosses ) , the magnetization rapidly increases , reaching @xmath113gd@xmath147 for @xmath148 kg .",
    "this is typical of a ferromagnetic magnetization for field applied along the direction of the moments ( easy axis ) .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath71 data ( open circles ) represent classical hard axis data , and are consistent with axial ferromagnetic ordering in this compound , as the saturated state is also reached , however at a slower rate ( _ i.e. _ , for @xmath149 kg ) .",
    "for the other neighboring tbptin compound , the dyptin magnetization resembles the similar data for gdptin , even though the presence of cef effects in the former system results in reduced magnetization values at our maximum applied field : as can be seen in fig.[f13 ] , the @xmath43 magnetization ( crosses ) rapidly increases with field , as expected for a ferromagnet with moments along _ c _ , but at @xmath111 kg its value is only @xmath150 of the theoretical saturated moment of 10 @xmath104 .",
    "for field applied within the basal plane ( open circles ) , only 0.5 of the saturated moment is reached following a metamagnetic transition around 35 kg . whereas more metamagnetic transitions beyond our maximum field of 55 kg could account for the small magnetization values in this compound , such a hypothesis does not address one more peculiarity already apparent for the rptin series : even though the r = gd and dy compounds are ferromagnetic , and the r = tb one is antiferromagnetic , their ordering temperatures scale well with the de gennes factor , as we showed in fig.[f25 ] .",
    "furthermore , the r = ho and er compounds also display ferromagnetic components of the ordered state magnetization , whereas tmptin is antiferromagnetic , and yet the de gennes scaling still holds for all heavy rptin compounds ( fig.[f25 ] ) .",
    "the question arises whether a generalized hypothesis exists , which could account for the magnetic ordering in all rptin systems ( r = gd - tm ) , or whether tbptin and tmptin should be regarded as exceptions from the ferromagnetic axial ordering across the series .    in what follows",
    "we will present one plausible model for the magnetic ordering in the local moment rptin compounds , a generalized version of the two - dimensional _ three ising - like systems model _ , which addresses the above points .",
    "we first proposed such a model for dyagge@xcite , an isostructural compound to rptin , for which a ferromagnetic component of the magnetization was also apparent along the _ c_-axis .    in the _ three co - planar ising - like systems model _ , we assume that the magnetic moments are allowed to three orientations ( along any three of the six equivalent six - fold symmetry axes within the basal plane ) , with two positions ( `` up '' and `` down '' ) per orientation .",
    "this results in a set of three two - fold degenerate easy - axes , @xmath6 away from each other , the degeneracy being a direct consequence of the requirement that the ising - like systems be co - planar : the `` up '' position for a given easy - axis is indistinguishable from the `` down '' position for the equivalent direction @xmath151 away .    if we release the restriction that the moments be co - planar , while still imposing that their _ in - plane _ projections be @xmath6 away from each other to preserve the hexagonal symmetry of the crystals , this degeneracy is lifted , and the moments are not necessarily ising - like systems any more . the three - dimensional model described above",
    "can be directly derived from the planar one , as follows : we consider that fig.[f26 ] represents the _ in - plane _ projection of the magnetic moments configuration , to which non - zero axial components of the moments are added .",
    "the possible resulting moment configurations can be obtained using any combination of `` up '' ( thin solid arrows ) or `` down '' ( thin dotted arrows ) planar and axial components of the magnetic moments , as shown in fig.[f27 ] .",
    "given the orthorhombic point symmetry of the magnetic moments sites , this yields two possible co - planar orientations for each magnetic moment , with the corresponding `` up '' and `` down '' positions for each .",
    "the thick solid arrows in fig.[f27 ] represent the full magnetic moments , which are parallel to three non - planar , equivalent directions ( _ i.e. _ , easy axes ) , inclined at an angle @xmath152 from the _ c_-axis .",
    "this configuration corresponds to the crystal field limited saturated paramagnetic cl - spm state , where all _ in - plane _ and axial components of the magnetic moments are in their respective `` up '' positions .",
    "it is worth noting that , by analogy with the two - dimensional model , there are two sets of easy axes : the [ 1  2  _ l_]-equivalent axes , where _ l _ is the _",
    "c_-axis miller index , for which the corresponding _ in - plane _ model exactly describes tbptin , or the [ 1  1  _ l_]-equivalent directions , with a two - dimensional analogous example being tmagge ( also described in detail by morosan _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite ) . in our present model and data analysis",
    ", we are assuming the first scenario , in which the easy axes are the [ 1  2  _ l_]-equivalent directions , which project in the _ ab_-plane onto the [ 1  2  0 ] directions .",
    "consequently we will refer to the ( 1  2  0 ) planes as the `` easy '' planes and the [ 1  2  0 ] directions as `` easy '' _ in - plane _ axes , whereas the ( 1  1  0 ) planes and the [ 1  1  0]-axes will be called in this case `` hard '' planes and `` hard '' _ in - plane _ axes respectively . when the [ 1  1  _ l _ ] directions are the easy axes , the same description is still valid , with the `` easy '' and `` hard '' planes and _ in - plane _ directions interchanged from the previous case .",
    "we have thus introduced a model generalized from the _ three co - planar ising - like systems model _ , which takes into account the cef effects on hexagonal compounds with orthorhombic point symmetry of the rare earths . for each compound",
    ", the strength of the cef effects will be reflected by the value of the angle @xmath152 between the easy - axes and the _ c_-axis . at low temperatures ,",
    "another energy scale is introduced by the applied magnetic field , and the model described above is only valid for fields much smaller than the cef energy . in this limit , for the highest applied fields ,",
    "a cl - spm state is reached , for which the anisotropic magnetization values are smaller than the theoretical saturated moments @xmath153 for the respective r ions .",
    "for a fixed angle @xmath152 , there are six possible easy - axes ( or three pairs of co - planar easy axes ) , each with the corresponding `` up '' and `` down '' positions . as in the case of the two - dimensional model , multiples s of three moments",
    "may be required to characterize the moment configuration for a given applied field .",
    "the orientation of the applied field will determine the magnetic moments to align along the three easy axes closest to the direction of the field , whereas its magnitude will determine the number of `` up '' and `` down '' moments along those three easy axes .",
    "the cl - spm state is reached when all three magnetic moments are in their `` up '' positions along three adjacent easy axes closest to the field direction ( or , equivalently , when all _ in - plane _ and axial components of the magnetic moments are in their `` up '' positions ) .",
    "this state is illustrated in fig.[f27 ] , for the magnetic field applied off the _ c_-axis .",
    "( if h is parallel to the _",
    "c_-axis , all six `` up '' positions of the magnetic moments are equally probable , and only when rotating the field away from _ c _ the three easy axes closest to the applied field direction are uniquely determined )",
    ".    experimentally we can only measure the projection of the magnetic moments along the field direction , with the resulting magnetization per magnetic moment given by    @xmath154~\\cdot~\\frac{\\overrightarrow{h}}{h}$ ] .",
    "moreover , we were able to measure the angular dependent magnetization for the magnetic field applied within the horizontal _ ab_-plane and the high - symmetry vertical planes ( _ i.e. _ , `` easy '' or `` hard '' planes ) .",
    "such data can be used to probe the validity of our model , by comparison with the theoretical calculation of the expected angular dependent `` easy '' and `` hard '' magnetization values .    for a fixed angle @xmath152 , and for field making an angle @xmath141 with the _",

    "these observations lend support to the idea that the three - dimensional model considered above could describe the rptin compounds , since for all r = tb - tm we have indeed observed reduced values of the high - field anisotropic magnetizations . on the other hand , it appears that the fully saturated magnetization measured for gdptin could be described by the above model for @xmath168 , but the absence of cef effects restricts the applicability of our model to this compound .    in the case of tbptin",
    "the magnetization measurements revealed extreme planar anisotropy of this compound ( fig.[f08 ] and [ f10 ] ) . within our three - dimensional model ,",

    "this may mean that either a totaly different model needs to be considered , or that the aforementioned model needs further refinement in order to describe at least the hoptin , and perhaps the rest of the rptin compounds .",

    "a small pt - deficiency in the ybptin is apparent from single crystal x - ray data , whereas all the other heavy r members of the series are believed to form stoichiometrically .",
    "because of this difference in composition , we leave the characterization of the ybptin system to a separate study@xcite , currently underway .",
    "the magnetic rptin compounds order magnetically above 2 k , with the ordering temperatures scaling well with the degennes dg factor ( fig.[f25 ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the coupling between the conduction electrons and the local magnetic moments giving rise to the long - range magnetic order via rkky exchange interaction .",

    "the magnetization of the tbptin compound is extremely anisotropic , with the magnetic moments confined to the _ ab_-plane . below the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature @xmath76 k ,",

    "simple geometrical relations allow us to calculated the expected components of the cl - spm magnetization along the _ c_-axis , as well as for the `` easy '' and `` hard '' in - plane orientations of the field . assuming that for @xmath111 kg ( in most cases the maximum available field for our measurements ) , the rptin systems indeed reach the cl - spm state at low temperatures , we can determine the fixed value for the angle @xmath152 for each compound , and compare the high - field measured magnetization values with the calculated ones .",
    "as can be seen from table 2 , all rptin ( r = tb - tm ) are well described by this model , with @xmath152 values between @xmath185 for r = tb , and @xmath186 for r = er .",
    "however , such a model does not fully account for the angular dependence of the magnetization , at least in the case of ho@xmath8y@xmath9ptin : this is qualitatively reproduced by the model calculations , with considerable differences between the measured and theoretical magnetization values for the whole angular range . whereas reasonable misorientation of the rotation sample can not account for these differences , we are led to believe that it is necessary to refine the over - simplified model described here , and also that additional measurements may help clarify the magnetic structure in these rptin compounds .",

    "<S> was developed , using the _ three co - planar ising - like systems model _ previously introduced for the extremely planar tbptin compound : given the orthorhombic point symmetry of the r sites , we assumed the magnetic moments to be confined to six non - planar easy axes , whose in - plane projections are rotate by @xmath6 with respect to each other . </S>",
    "<S> such a model is consistent with the reduced high - field magnetization values observed for the rptin compounds , r@xmath7 tb - tm , and qualitatively reproduces the features of the angular dependent magnetization of ho@xmath8y@xmath9ptin at @xmath10 55 kg . </S>"
