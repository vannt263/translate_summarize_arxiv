    "detection of the first - generation galaxies from redshifts @xmath0 is one of the most important and most challenging goals of modern cosmology . of particular interest is the possibility to detect any spectral lines from these galaxies , because such an observation would provide the key parameter of redshift .",
    "the prospects of detecting high - frequency hydrogen recombination lines ( such as the low members of lyman or balmer series ) from the ionized regions and the 21-cm line from the surrounding neutral gas have been intensively discussed ( _ e.g. _ pritchard & loeb 2012 ) .",
    "spaans & norman ( 1997 ) investigated the possibility of detecting high-@xmath4 hydrogen recombination lines amplified by the maser mechanism from the inhomogeneities of the expanding universe at the epoch of recombination ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "they also mentioned the possibility of detectable masing @xmath6 lines from the first galaxies , at @xmath7 , which , after redshift , fall into the low - frequency ( @xmath8mhz ) radio domain . in a recent study , rule _",
    "et al . _  ( 2013 ) demonstrated that finding spontaneous emission in the high-@xmath4 hydrogen recombination lines in a blind search will probably be a challenge even for the most powerful modern facilities .",
    "et al . _",
    "suggest that masing in some of these lines may help in making them detectable .",
    "for maser amplification in a spectral line to occur , the populations of the corresponding energy levels must be inverted .",
    "the theoretical possibility of population inversion for the rydberg levels of recombining hydrogen in the galactic h@xmath1 regions first appeared in the calculations by baker & menzel ( 1938 ) , but it was overlooked by them ( see strelnitski 2012 ) .",
    "the inversion was confirmed in many studies afterwards , starting with the important paper by goldberg ( 1966 ) who pointed out that population inversion was implicitly present in the analytical results of seaton ( 1964 ) and that it can increase considerably the intensities of high-@xmath4 radio recombination lines from h@xmath1 regions .",
    "later , the theoretical possibility of population inversion across large intervals of @xmath4 , depending on the gas density and , less so , on its temperature , was demonstrated and studied by several investigators [ _ e.g. _ salem & brocklehurst ( 1979 ) , walmsley ( 1990 ) ; story & hummer ( 1995 ) ; strelnitski _ et al . _  ( 1996 ) ] .    from their analysis of the dominant reactions controlling the level populations ,",
    "baker & menzel ( 1938 ) came to the conclusion that all the processes induced by the radiation of the ionizing star , except for the photo - ionization from the ground level , are insignificant and can be ignored in the calculations .",
    "this approach has dominated most of the subsequent comprehensive studies , including the most ambitious computations by brocklehurst ( 1970 ) and by storey & hummer ( 1995 ) . in these and most other computations the level populations were presented as a function of only two parameters  the electron temperature and density .",
    "the star s parameters ( such as temperature , luminosity , distance from the region in question ) were absent .",
    "the only external radiation that usually was taken into account was the black - body cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with the contemporary temperature of @xmath9k .",
    "note that spaans &  norman s ( 1997 ) numerical estimates of possible maser effects at the epoch of re - ionization were based on storey & hummer s ( 1995 ) computations ignoring the radiation from the ionizing star .    even if the `` @xmath10k cmb",
    "; no star '' approach can represent adequately the conditions in most of the h@xmath1 regions of our own and other nearby galaxies , it may not be sufficient for understanding the situation in the galaxies of first generation .",
    "first of all , the cmb temperature was then considerably higher  up to @xmath11k at @xmath12 .",
    "not less importantly , the metal - poor `` population iii '' stars that produced the bulk of ionization in the early galaxies and beyond ( causing the whole phenomenon of re - ionization of the universe ) were special  very massive ( @xmath13 ) and very hot ( @xmath14k ) ( _ e.g. _ haiman &  loeb 1997 ) .",
    "transitions induced by the radiation of such stars might have competed effectively with the spontaneous radiative processes and collisional processes in controlling hydrogen level populations .",
    "the goal of the present study is to investigate the effects of the radiation of hot , massive stars and of a warmer cmb on the distribution of hydrogen level populations , including possible population inversion , at the epoch of first galaxy formation and to determine principal limitations of the strength of maser emission in hydrogen recombination lines from these galaxies . in section",
    "2 we provide general arguments in favor of the hypothesis that the effects caused by the star and cmb radiation may be significant .",
    "the computational procedure we used to check this assumption by numerical simulation is described in section  3 and the results of the simulations  in section  4 .",
    "section  5 is devoted to an analysis of possible regimes of maser amplification in galaxies and to natural limitations of maser amplification .",
    "section 6 contains some concluding remarks .",
    "in order to demonstrate the potential importance of radiative processes induced by the star for the distribution of level populations , we compare the rate of population supply by the transitions from the ( most populated ) ground level induced by the radiation of the star to the rates of two other processes that are considered to be of a primary importance : the radiative recombination and the spontaneous cascade from higher levels .",
    "we consider menzel s case b ( an infinitely high optical depth in all the lyman lines ) , for which the effective ground level is the level @xmath15 , and calculate the ratios @xmath16 and @xmath17 of the excitation rate of level @xmath4 induced by the star s radiation to the rates of the two reference processes : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the population of level @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the intensity of radiation averaged over the frequencies within the absorption profile of the line @xmath22 and over directions ; @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the einstein coefficients ; @xmath25 is the electron density ; and @xmath26 is the coefficient of radiative recombination to level @xmath4 .",
    "( here and afterwards our notations in equations are similar to those of burgess & summers ( 1976 ) , with the exception that we deal with the average intensity instead of the energy density of radiation . )",
    "the calculations were done for constant values of the temperature of the star ( considered to radiate as a black body ) , @xmath27k , and the electron temperature , @xmath28k .",
    "the dilution factors @xmath29 were calculated by considering the ionized gas at the periphery of the strmgren sphere ( where the bulk of the mass of an ionization - bounded h@xmath1 region is located ) .",
    "using table 2.3 from osterbrock & ferland ( 2006 ) , the following empirical equation connecting @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath25 was obtained : @xmath31 for the crude estimates of relative rates of population supply , we assumed lte populations for all the levels , except level @xmath15 .",
    "the population of the latter was calculated by balancing the major processes of population supply and depletion : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the intensity of ionizing radiation from the star averaged over directions , @xmath34 is the einstein @xmath35 coefficient for the bound - free transition from level 2 to a virtual level @xmath36 of the continuum , and @xmath37 is the electron impact rate for transition @xmath38 .",
    "tables [ tab : pex / ar ] and [ tab : pex / na ] show the results of calculations of @xmath16 and @xmath17 for various levels and a range of electron densities expected in the h@xmath1 regions of the galaxies of first generation ( wood & loeb 2000 ) .",
    "it is seen that the values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 depend very weakly on the electron density and that for the levels with @xmath39 the excitation of level @xmath4 from the ground level by the direct star s radiation is comparable with other processes controlling the populations .",
    "the decrease of @xmath16 and @xmath17 with the increasing @xmath4 means that photo - excitation by direct stellar radiation must have a _ cooling _",
    "effect on population distribution .",
    "in other words , when the radiation of the star is taken into account , we expect the inversion for @xmath3-transitions predicted by the calculations ignoring the star to decrease .",
    ".values of @xmath16 given by equation ( [ eq : pexratios ] ) for @xmath27k , @xmath28k , and @xmath29 and @xmath40 calculated using equations ( [ eq : w ] ) and ( [ eq : n2 ] ) respectively . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : pex / na ]    it can be shown analytically ( see appendix a ) that in the range of high enough star temperatures , the influence of the stellar radiation  the rate of photo - excitation from level @xmath41 , and thus the cooling effect on population distribution  decreases with the increasing stellar temperature .",
    "this effect happens because as @xmath30 increases , the increase of the depopulation rate of the ground level @xmath42 through photo - ionization proceeds faster than the increase of the rate of transitions @xmath43 .",
    "one can expect , therefore , that the calculated degree of inversion will be greater in the presence of a hotter star .",
    "it can also be demonstrated analytically that for low enough star temperatures the effect should reverse , because at low @xmath30 the control of the depletion of the ground level population passes from photoionization to collisional processes .",
    "however , numerical simulations ( section 4 ) show that this happens at @xmath44k , and such stars are inefficient in creating h@xmath1 regions .",
    "although the bulk of the gas in a quasi - spherical , ionization - bounded h@xmath1 region is situated at the periphery of the region , and the equation gives a crude estimate of the dilution factor there , it is of some interest whether the distribution of the hydrogen level populations , and , in particular , the degree of the population inversion , depends on the dilution factor ( the distance to the ionizing star ) .",
    "analytical arguments presented in appendix b show that this dependence must be weak .",
    "therefore , we consider our results obtained with the use of equation  both in this section and in section 4  as reliable for all the ionized gas of a galaxy .      in order to estimate the role of the cmb in the control of the level populations",
    ", we can compare the rate of transitions induced by the cmb with the rate of spontaneous decay of the levels , the latter dominating the population depletion of the levels with @xmath45 under the electron densities considered here ( @xmath46 ) . with the use of the planck equation for @xmath47 , the standard relation between the einstein coefficients , and the well known equation for the frequency of the hydrogen @xmath3-transitions , the condition of the cmb dominance",

    "in order to verify and specify the conclusions drawn in section 2 using an analytical approach , we performed computer modeling of hydrogen rydberg level populations under the assumed physical conditions in the h@xmath1 regions of the first generation galaxies .",
    "we follow burgess & summers ( 1976 ) in the mathematical formulation of the problem .",
    "the populations are assumed to be in a steady state .",
    "the following transitions are accounted for : radiative excitation and de - excitation ( spontaneous and stimulated ) , radiative ionization and recombination ( spontaneous and stimulated ) , collisional excitation , de - excitation and ionization , and three - body recombination .",

    "4a in strelnitski et al .",

    "in particular , there is a broad minimum of negative @xmath70 ( maximum of inversion ) , with the quantum number corresponding to the highest inversion decreasing when the electron density increases .",
    "[ fig:1abc ] demonstrates that even for contemporary hii regions ( @xmath80k ) the inclusion of the processes of population transfer induced by the radiation of the star in the computations may result in significant changes of the degree of inversion .",
    "the scale of the effect depends on the electron density , decreasing as @xmath25 increases .",
    "[ fig:1abc ] also shows that , as analytically predicted in section 2.2 , the degree of inversion tends to increase for increasing stellar temperatures  the `` no star '' case having the largest degree of inversion .",
    "this tendency holds for the whole range of stellar temperatures interesting for the present study , @xmath81k . for lower @xmath30 ,",
    "the tendency reverses , because of the decreasing role of depopulation of the effective ground level @xmath15 by photodissociation , as compared with collisional depopulation .",
    "this reversal is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] for @xmath82k : in this temperature domain , with the decrease of @xmath30 the solution tends to that of `` no star . ''",
    "as argued in section [ sec : star ] and appendix b , variations in the dilution factor do nt have a significant effect on the population distribution , which justifies the use of equation ( 2.2 ) .",
    "the weakness of the solution dependence on @xmath29 is confirmed by the numerical simulation presented in fig .",

    ", the population transfer processes stimulated by the radiation of the star were excluded in these numerical models ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "the figure shows that at low densities ( fig .",
    "4.4a ) a significant increase in cmb temperature ( between @xmath80k and @xmath86k , i.e. the increase of @xmath52 between @xmath87 and 30 ) can cause a noticeable change in the population distribution .",
    "as anticipated ( see section 2 ) , only transitions with @xmath54 are affected .",
    "the most remarkable feature is the difference in the `` sign '' of the effect between the transitions around the maximum of inversion ( @xmath88  80 ) and those with lower and higher @xmath4 s : the increase in cmb temperature causes a decrease in the degree of inversion for the former and a slight increase for the latter .",
    "these effects , however , decrease for higher electron densities , as seen in fig .",
    "the expected combined effects produced on low-@xmath4 transitions by the cmb and the radiation of relatively populous high - mass , high - temperature population iii stars in the first galaxies at @xmath89 ( @xmath90k ) are illustrated in fig .",
    "although the increase of the degree of inversion is not large , for some of these transitions the effect may mean a jump from the state of no inversion to the state of inversion and thus a principal possibility of maser amplification .",
    "a specific feature of radio recombination lines from h@xmath1 regions , especially important for lower frequency lines , is that they are formed together with the free - free continuum",
    ". therefore the emission and absorption processes in both the line and the continuum must be included in the radiative transfer equation .",
    "the major effects of stimulated emission in radio recombination lines can be demonstrated with the simple model of a steady - state , homogeneous , plane - parallel ionized medium of finite optical thickness ( hereafter `` the cloud '' ) . the solution of the radiative transfer equation for such a cloud can be given the following useful form ( shaver 1978 ) : @xmath91\\\\ & + \\ , s_0\\,{\\rm e}^{-\\tau_c}({\\rm e}^{-\\tau_l } -1)\\ ; , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the observed flux densities at the central frequency of the line and in the adjacent continuum , @xmath94 is the planck function , @xmath95 is the solid angle subtended by the cloud as seen from earth , @xmath96 is the ( unattenuated ) flux density due to a background source of continuum ( which is supposed to subtend a solid angle @xmath97 ) ; @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the total optical depths of the cloud due to the continuum and line opacities , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath100 , introduced by goldberg ( 1966 ) , is very nearly equal to the ratio of the line - plus - continuum opacities in and out of lte : @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 are the line and continuum absorption coefficients , and asterisks denote lte . the non - lte line opacity and optical depth are obtained by multiplying the corresponding lte values by @xmath104 .",
    "three asymptotic cases of the line amplification can be extracted from equation  ( [ eq : dels ] ) :    _ ( 1 ) low opacities , no background continuum _ ( goldberg 1966 ) .",
    "assuming @xmath105 ( but not @xmath106 ! ) @xmath107 and @xmath108 , equation  ( [ eq : dels ] ) reduces to @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the line flux density above the continuum in lte .",
    "the term in the parentheses describes amplification of the radiation at the line frequencies due to the stimulation of line emission by the free - free continuum of the cloud . because @xmath111 for the free - free continuum and because the maximum achievable values of @xmath112 increase with the decreasing line frequency ( see strelnitski _",

    "( shaver 1978 ) .",
    "the background continuum stimulates line transitions in this case , reducing equation  ( [ eq : dels ] ) to @xmath114 the line - to - continuum flux density ratio equals just @xmath115 , and thus , if @xmath99 is not too small ( say , @xmath116 ) , the line emission stimulated by the background source can make the line detectable on the continuum background . shaver considered the synchrotron emission of a galactic nucleus as a continuum background .",

    "this is the `` true '' maser amplification , in contrast with the two previous cases  of low - opacity and possibly even _ positive _ net value of the absorption coefficient , which goldberg ( 1966 ) called `` partial masing . ''",
    "the `` true '' masing is more probable at high frequencies , where the free - free continuum is relatively weak .",
    "the first true , high - gain masers in mm hydrogen recombination lines ( h@xmath121 to h@xmath122 ) were discovered three decades ago in the ionized disk / outflow of the peculiar emission - line star mwc 349 ( martn - pintado _ et al . _",

    "note that the net absorption coefficients calculated in strelnitski _",
    "et al . _  ( 1996a ) were based on computer simulations for ordinary , contemporary h@xmath1 regions .",
    "as it was argued in the previous sections , the conditions in the h@xmath1 regions of the first - generation galaxies might be quite different and , in particular , these conditions might be conducive to higher population inversion in the lower-@xmath4 hydrogen @xmath3-lines .",

    "for all the transitions below these curves , one can take @xmath162 , and for those above the curves @xmath163 .",
    "the condition `` one maser photon per one pumping cycle '' under full saturation allows for an estimate of the upper limit for the photon luminosity of a maser source .",

    "this study showed that the transitions between hydrogen rydberg levels stimulated by the radiation of the ionizing star of an h@xmath1 region may influence the distribution of the level populations significantly , and thus it is recommended to include these processes in the computations of hydrogen level populations both in contemporary h@xmath1 regions and in those of the high - redshift galaxies .",
    "for the latter , an additional factor influencing the population distribution of higher levels ( @xmath54 ) is the warmer cmb .",
    "our computations of the hydrogen population distributions under the assumed physical conditions in the h@xmath1 regions of high - redshift galaxies demonstrates a qualitative pattern similar to what had been obtained in several previous computations  for contemporary h@xmath1 regions : a sequence of inverted @xmath3-transitions in a broad range of the principal quantum number @xmath4 , the central @xmath4 value of the range decreasing when the electron density increases .",
    "the closeness of our results , obtained without the inclusion of the radiative processes induced by the star , to the results of the best previous studies confirms the reliability of the chosen method of solution .    when the processes induced by the star radiation , as well as by the radiation of the cmb ( with the temperature corresponding to the redshift ) are included , the distortion of the populations may be both `` positive '' and `` negative ''  an increase or a decrease of the population inversion .",
    "a characteristic pattern for a high-@xmath52 ( high @xmath50 ) and high @xmath30 model is a decrease of inversion for the transitions with @xmath4 around the maximum inversion and an increase of inversion at lower and higher @xmath4 s ( see figs .",
    "4.4 and 4.5 ) .    in our calculations we ignored the transitions between @xmath182-sublevels induced by collisions with protons , therefore",
    "some more subtle effects noticed in previous studies , such as the appearance of `` over - cooled '' transitions ( e.g. strelnitski et al .",
    "1996a ) are not seen on our graphs . however , this simplification may be supported by recent studies which show that the effects of proton collisions are less significant than previously assumed ( vrinceanu _ et al . _",
    "2012 ) .",
    "a potentially important result is the prediction of a possible population inversion of low@xmath183 transitions , with @xmath184 .",
    "after redshift from @xmath185 , these transitions fall into the sub - millimeter domain .",
    "although the effects of maser saturation should limit the possible maser ( or rather laser ) gains of these high - frequency transitions to a factor of 10 or so , this may be enough to make some of them detectable with sensitive modern radio interferometers , such as alma ( see also rule et al .",
