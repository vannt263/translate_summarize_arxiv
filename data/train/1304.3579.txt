    "the experimental observation @xcite of superfluidity in the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer - bose - einstein condensate ( bcs - bec ) crossover regime has given impetus to the study of ultra - cold trapped fermi gases at unitarity @xcite .",
    "though the beginning of the experimental study of superfluidity in cold atomic gases dates back to the observation of bec , a decade and half ago @xcite , the interaction controlled superfluidity , where atomic fermi gas changes constituents from cooper pairs to composite bosons , is fairly new @xcite . as the atoms pass through a situation , where the inter - atomic s - wave scattering length diverges ( the unitarity ) , several novel phenomena have been observed , some having strong resemblance with characteristics of high-@xmath0 superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the theory of crossover ( the interaction driven study from bcs to bec passing the unitarity ) was first suggested long time back @xcite and has been studied systematically in the early eighties @xcite .",
    "the recent advancement in experiments @xcite has opened up avenues for deeper understanding of nonperturbative aspects of this strongly interacting system , in a controlled manner .",
    "lower dimensional nonlinear systems are known to exhibit counter intuitive features , which are not possible in the three dimensional world . a classic example being existence of bright and dark solitons in quasi one dimensional bec @xcite , which derive their stability from the balancing of nonlinear effect with dispersion .",
    "the spreading effect of dispersion is exactly compensated by non - linearity , resulting in these stable structures @xcite . here",
    ", we show the existence of bell shaped solitons ( bell - antibell pair ) in the ultra - cold atomic gases which are non - topological in nature .",
    "we note that a soliton solution can be classified in many ways , depending upon its shape ( bell , kink , breather ) ; nature of the non - linear systems ( thus governing non - linear equations ) which lead kdv ( pulse ) soliton , sine - gordon soliton , non - linear schrdinger  ( nls ) soliton ( envelop soliton ) ; depending on its topology such as topological and non topological solitons etc .",
    "contrary to the envelop ( bright ) solitons , a bell soliton is generally obtained from a kdv type of equation and the amplitude of the soliton is directly proportional to its velocity @xcite .",
    "similar hyperbolic secant pulse profiles have been observed in a number of natural systems , the most notable being the phenomenon of self - induced transparency in atomic media @xcite .",
    "we establish the conditions under which such localized structures can manifest in the fermionic cold gases .",
    "this is explicated through exact solution in a controlled mean field approach , which enables us to observe the pulse dynamics , starting from the fermionic side and ending up in the bose - einstein condensate .    in the context of the bcs - bec crossover , mean - field microscopic description",
    "is well captured by the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation @xcite .",
    "the analysis of bdg equation is considerably more involved as compared to the gross - pitaevskii  ( gp ) equation , describing the mean field dynamics of bec .",
    "_ , have numerically solved the bdg equation in a box and discussed the behavior of dark soliton , in a superfluid fermi gas along the entire crossover domain , in a quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) geometry @xcite .",
    "similar approach was also adopted in the later studies as well @xcite .",
    "_ , have developed a simpler approach , using extended thomas - fermi density functional theory ( etfdft ) , which incorporates the interaction through polytropic density of state @xcite , where it was shown that for @xmath1 , it is possible to accurately find the collective properties in the crossover regime .",
    "more recently , wen _",
    "_ , have presented the dark and bright soliton solutions through the route of perturbative analysis of the above mean field equation @xcite .",
    "this leads to korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation whose soliton solutions are well known .    before going into the details of our analysis , here we like spend some time on the pros and cons of the etfdft model .",
    "as mentioned before , a bdg analysis is one of the most robust way of treating the unitary fermi gas as it takes into account the main contribution to the kinetic energy , and treat it exactly in noninteracting systems even with a nonuniform density spatial variation .",
    "where as this approach gives the exact kinetic energy only for a uniform system and even when extended with the addition of gradient and higher order derivatives of the density , the etf functional is not able to reproduce shell effects in the density profile .",
    "but in this model one need not to worry about the number of particles which is a big concern in bdg approach .",
    "more over through etfdft one can obtain the qualitative physical picture at zero temperature with relative numerical ease .",
    "thus it is worth looking at the unitary fermi system using this model .    here , we present ( i ) an exact bell soliton solution from the etfdft by showing a direct connection of etfdft with lienard type of equations .",
    "thereby we obtain the soliton solution which does not necessitate any perturbative approach @xcite .",
    "these solitons have highest contrast in the bec regime , similar to the earlier result for vortices and dark solitons @xcite .",
    "( ii ) we explore the collective excitations and obtain the sound velocity which shows an explicit dependence on the phenomenological @xmath2 parameter ( unless we absorb the quantum pressure term inside the chemical potential ) .",
    "( iii ) the stability of these solitons are discussed in terms of noether charge . in the last few passages we present ( iv ) a scheme to treat etfdft analytically when the ultracold atomic fermi gas is subjected to a harmonic trap and we observe the resulting oscillating dynamics of the soliton due to the parabolic confinement .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ poly ] , we discuss the polytropic approximation for obtaining the relevant equation of state in the crossover regime .",
    "a brief account is also presented on dimensional reduction of mean - field dynamics , to deal with quasi 1d scenario . in sec .",
    "[ loca ] , we have presented the exact connection between the etfdft and lienard type equation , from which we obtain bell soliton solutions .",
    "we then explore its evolution from weak to strong coupling regimes .",
    "further , we present the oscillating dynamics of the soliton and establish its supersonic nature by analyzing the sound velocity in this medium . the stability is analyzed in the light of noether charge and associated energy .",
    "[ con ] is devoted for the concluding remarks and future directions of study .",
    "in recent years , manini _ et al .",
    "_ , have shown a simple way to investigate the unitary fermi gas without losing its essential essence @xcite .",
    "in particular , for @xmath1 they have built an efficient parametrization of the energy per particle , based on monte carlo data and asymptotic behavior of the interaction . prior to that , it was shown that a power law dependence of equation of state can be effective to find reliable expressions for the collective frequencies which is analytically treatable but preserves the vital physical picture @xcite .",
    "later it was demonstrated that , at zero temperature under local density approximation the homogeneous chemical potential can be written in a series expansion of gas parameters with good effect @xcite .",
    "here , we make use of this etfdft approach to investigate the existence of solitonic modes in superfluid fermi gas .",
    "we start from the etfdft equation , which controls the dynamics of the trapped superfluid fermi gas @xcite : @xmath3\\psi,\\label{eq:2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the ginzburg - landau order parameter at zero temperature and the normalization condition @xmath5 ( @xmath6 being the total atomic pair number of the superfluid fermi gas ) and @xmath7 is the trapping potential .",
    "the bulk chemical potential or equation of state is characterized by @xmath8 .",
    "we can introduce the polytropic approximation for equation of state as @xmath9 . as discussed earlier",
    ", the polytropic approximation holds good at zero temperature under local density approximation which is essentially a perturbative approach capable of providing deep insight into the physical nature of the quantum system @xcite . under the polytropic approximation , @xmath10 is the reference chemical potential , which we will explain after a short while , and @xmath11 is the atomic density .",
    "it is worth noting that , the interaction term is always positive in the whole bcs - bec crossover .",
    "we consider @xmath2 as a phenomenological parameter , accounting for the increase of kinetic energy due to the spatial variation of the density . the motivation to introduce the @xmath2 comes from the density functional theory where a gradient correction was introduced to account for the non uniformity of the system @xcite .",
    "an energy functional for fermions in terms of the density and its derivatives is usually called extended thomas - fermi ( etf ) functional . now",
    "if we define @xmath12 as the local number density then a quantity like @xmath13 can be interpreted as a next to leading term correction factor , where @xmath14 being the atomic mass .",
    "there exits some ambiguity regarding the value of @xmath2 as well .",
    "initially the value was considered as @xmath15 in context of bcs - bec crossover @xcite but later it was suggested that @xmath16 is better choice based on its good agreement with the theoretical epsilon analysis around @xmath17 spatial dimensions in unitary regime @xcite . for @xmath16 , eq.([eq:2 ] ) reduces to a form similar to the gp equation .",
    "since the formation of soliton is due to the delicate balance between dispersion and nonlinearity , and in quasi one dimensional ( q1d ) systems , the quantum pressure has significant contribution to dispersion , therefore one must pay careful attention to @xmath2 .",
    "further , in q1d the particle number of the condensate is small , which makes the contribution of quantum pressure more significant . for large number of atoms ,",
    "the radial contribution becomes significant .",
    "the ground state wave function in the radial direction is thomas - fermi ( tf ) type , which results in discrete eigenmodes of linear excitations in the radial direction , and hence induces a dispersion effect on the wave propagation in axial direction .",
    "the resulting dispersion can balance the nonlinear interaction and make the system more favorable to form solitons .",
    "the essence of the interaction driven crossover is embedded in the polytropic coefficient @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , before going into the details of calculation , we briefly summarize the behavior of @xmath18 and associated reference chemical potential @xmath10 . here",
    ", the weak coupling to strong coupling evolution is captured through the following relation @xcite , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an analytical function , whose parameters are fixed using the monte carlo data @xcite , and @xmath21 . if one plots eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) one will find that @xmath22 $ ] ( roughly ) , while @xmath23 $ ] , thus at @xmath24 eq .  ( [ eq:2 ] ) effectively reduces to the gross - pitaevskii  equation .",
    "where as , in the fermi system the ground state energy is proportional to ( density)@xmath25 therefore , one can obtain the bcs like picture while @xmath26 and thereby it becomes possible to retain the essence of both the limits . in a similar fashion , the reference chemical potential",
    "can be defined as , @xmath27.\\label{mu0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the study of the superfluids at zero temperature can take various routes .",
    "one simple yet effective way is to study the hydrodynamics of the system .",
    "the ground state solution of superfluid hydrodynamic equations corresponds to @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 being the superfluid density and velocity components)@xcite . as a result , it is possible to determine the ground state chemical potential ( @xmath32 ) of the superfluid system : @xmath33 .",
    "here @xmath34 denotes equilibrium density , which can be related to the reference density through the polytropic approximation as @xmath35^{1/\\gamma}$ ] , @xmath36 is particle number density .",
    "one can obtain @xmath10 from eq.([mu0 ] ) and @xmath36 is taken as the density of the ideal fermi gas at the trapping center of the system .",
    "the external potential is the usual harmonic trap , which in cylindrical coordinate takes the form , @xmath37 , with @xmath38 .",
    "the tf radius in radial and axial directions can be written as , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively . applying the normalization condition for equilibrium density ( @xmath41 )",
    "the ground state chemical potential can be written as @xcite , @xmath42^{2\\gamma/(2 + 3\\gamma)},\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 and @xmath44 . in the preceding sections",
    ", it will be established that @xmath32 plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of soliton and also sound propagation in this medium .      to model a cigar shaped trap , it is essential to consider that the interaction energy in the transverse direction is much less than the kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "the fermions are assumed to be confined in a cylindrical harmonic trap , with radial frequency much larger than the axial one , i.e. , @xmath45 .",
    "the important assumption we need to make for employing the gaussian variational ansatz in bec in such situations is that , the interaction energy per particle must be weaker than the zero point energies associated with the harmonic confinement @xcite .",
    "though this method has its own limitation , it is widely used in dilute bose gas . since the current etfdft model also lies on dilute limit where the inter - particle separation is much smaller than the @xmath46-wave scattering length therefore we are safe to use the similar gaussian ansatz here as well .    to reduce eq.([eq:2 ] ) into q1d form by using gaussian ansatz , we consider @xmath47 where @xmath48 . the reduced nonlinear schrdinger  equation ( nlse )",
    "then becomes , @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and @xmath10 is appropriately normalized by @xmath51 .",
    "we first analyze the results without the trap , and later we will incorporate the trap to obtain analytic solutions . the solution of the above nlse , without the pressure and trap have been studied in different perspective @xcite . using a traveling wave ansatz of the type @xmath52 , we study the system in the comoving frame , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the soliton velocity . after applying these transformation in eq.([eq:4 ] ) , the imaginary equation ( imaginary part of eq.([eq:4 ] ) ) arising from the current conservation gives , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is an integration constant .",
    "we consider the phase and amplitude as uncorrelated and hence assume @xmath57 .",
    "the real equation ( real part of eq.([eq:4 ] ) ) then reads , @xmath58 where we have used the results from eq.([eq:42 ] ) .",
    "the subscript @xmath59 means derivative with respect to @xmath59 .",
    "it is worth noting that for @xmath60 , one can have full set of jacobi elliptic function as solutions . for fermi gas",
    ", we do not have such freedom and we need to solve the equation , considering @xmath18 as unknown . later on",
    "we will use selected values of @xmath18 obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "till date only a few studies have addressed the complexity involving the polytropic assumption . very recently , wen _",
    "@xcite , made such efforts and studied both dark and bright solitons using a perturbative expansion scheme on the mean field equation .",
    "interestingly , there exists a transformation which will enable us to reduce this equation to a well known form , which has exact solutions . without loss of generality one can take @xmath61 , which connects eq .",
    "( [ eq:43 ] ) to a lienard type equation : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we like to mention here that one can obtain a real constant solution from eq.([eq:11 ] ) iff @xmath65 , as @xmath66 .",
    "but soon we will see that the prevailing condition is inconsistent while we try to obtain a localized solution .",
    "thus we refrain ourselves from the constant solution . to obtain a localized solution",
    "we apply fractional transformation @xcite of the following form , @xmath67}{1+c\\,{\\mathrm{sech}}^2[b \\zeta/2]}.\\label{eq:12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as short recap , we like to remind the readers that fractional transformation is an useful tool to obtain solutions from a non - linear equation . in this approach , one can consider an ansatz solution in the following way , @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 can be any power of the function @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 are constant which can be evaluated through consistency conditions after applying this ansatz in the main equation and collecting the coefficients according to the power of @xmath71 .",
    "a comprehensive description of this process can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we follow the same prescription , thereby application of eq.([eq:12 ] ) in eq.([eq:11 ] ) leads to the following set of consistency conditions : @xmath76 the obtained solutions are , @xmath77         since our motivation is to find localized solutions , it is important to impose @xmath78 ( contrary to the constant solution ) , otherwise the solution will be of trigonometric form ( since @xmath79 always for this kind of system ) having singularities in time evolution .",
    "one should note that , the above assumption actually imposes a ceiling on the soliton velocity contrary to the usual bright soliton solution whose velocity is not bounded . incorporating this assumption ,",
    "the solution can be simplified to the compact form ( after normalization ) , @xmath80{\\frac{\\gamma(v^2-\\mu_{g})}{\\lambda(\\gamma-2)}}\\right\\rbrace^{1/\\gamma}\\times\\left\\lbrace{\\mathrm{sech}}\\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma ( v^2-\\mu_{g})}{\\lambda(\\gamma-2)}}\\zeta\\right]\\right\\rbrace^{1/\\gamma},\\label{eq:14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the polarity of the soliton ( bell / anti - bell ) and @xmath82 is the incomplete beta function .",
    "it is worth pointing out that , this is a distinct and new solution ( bell type ) , as compared to the solution presented in ref .",

    "the solid red line is our analytic result ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:14 ] ) ) , the corresponding numerical solution is depicted through blue squares .",
    "the numerical result presented here are obtained via solving etfdft equation using the split - step crank - nicolson method by discretizing in space and time @xcite . the discretized equation is then solved by propagation in imaginary time over small time steps ( @xmath85 , total time step is taken as @xmath86 ) .",
    "both the results agree appreciably well with each other .",
    "one must notice that in eq.([eq:14 ] ) , if @xmath87 , the solution will be unstable as referred in ref .",

    "it is important to observe the change in visibility of the bell solitons across the crossover .",
    "the visibility / amplitude of the bell soliton is different in different superfluid regimes . for dark soliton",
    ", it has already been shown that visibility is maximum in the bec side @xcite . in fig.([rho ] ) , we notice that the visibility does increase as we move from weak coupling to strong coupling regime .",
    "further , one can note that the change in visibility is more rapid in bec side and this increase is monotonic .",
    "a qualitative comparison with the visibility of vortex core density in the bcs - bec crossover @xcite reveals striking resemblance with our study .      before presenting the sound velocity result in our system ,",
    "we intend to address one intriguing issue regarding the sound velocity .",
    "it is well know that one can calculate the sound velocity through the hydrodynamics as well as from the etfdft equation ( eq.[eq:2])@xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the effect of quantum pressure does not enter in the sound velocity expression if we use the hydrodynamic approach ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "this is even true for etfdft approach if we absorb the quantum pressure term in the chemical potential .",
    "but otherwise the quantum pressure term will leave an effect on the sound velocity .",
    "we now analyze the soliton propagation velocity , for the bell solitons and relate it to the sound velocity . a general way to obtain the sound velocity is by applying a small perturbation about a constant background .",
    "a systematic calculation reveals , @xmath90 ( since @xmath91 ) considering the homogeneous unperturbed condensate density varies slowly in space .",
    "one should note here that the contribution arising from the quantum pressure ( @xmath2 ) also makes a presence in determining the sound velocity .",
    "qualitatively our results are in good agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite but small quantitative difference might be due the fact that , our analysis is very different in nature from the previous analysis where collective excitations were calculated from the density fluctuation in three dimension . as an example , in the deep bec limit with @xmath60 and @xmath16 , @xmath92 as obtained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we have seen that condition for existence of bell soliton is @xmath93 . from the above discussions on sound ,",

    "the whole crossover is unstable but gradual increase in the velocity stabilizes the system for different interaction regime . at @xmath101",
    "interestingly one can see that , the crossover regime is stable where as , the two extreme regimes are unstable .",
    "afterwards , ( @xmath102 ) , the entire crossover satisfy the stability criterion .",

    "thus the temporal variation of the interaction is coupled with width of the solution , as was observed in in ref .",
    "it must be noted that eq.([eq:10 ] ) is same as eq.([eq:43 ] ) . hence one can find the same solution with distributed coefficients ( in the homogeneous case , @xmath122 ) .",

    "it should be mentioned that the oscillation frequency does not show any dependence on the inter atomic interaction , which might be due to the limitation of the hydrodynamic approach .",
