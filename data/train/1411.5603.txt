    "quantum mechanics goes to great lengths to ensure that the wavefunctions are singlevalued .",
    "this means discarding terms in the solution to the schrdinger equation that either blow up at the origin or diverge at infinity .",
    "solutions of second - order differential equations which are rational lead to multivaluedness , and great efforts were spent , in the late nineteenth century , to uniformize the solutions so as to render them singlevalued .",
    "however , multivaluedness is not a stigma , and will explain numerous phenomena from the interaction of polarized beams to the aharonov - bohm effect .",
    "in this paper we treat multivaluedness from the theory of automorphic functions .",
    "if a vector is parallel - transported around a closed curve it may not necessarily return as the same vector it started as .",
    "the effect is known as holonomy , and has been attributed to positive , gaussian curvature  @xcite .",
    "holonomy also occurs when we solve a fuchsian differential equation as a power series and take the analytic continuation around a regular singular point .",
    "we will , in general , not get back the solution we started with but one that differs from it by a phase factor",
    ".    we will show that geometric phase is a manifestation of periodicity with respect to a group of motions of the tessellations of a disc , or half - plane , by lunes or curvilinear triangles , depending on whether the fuchsian differential equation has two or three regular singular points , respectively .",
    "functions whose only singular points are rational functions will be solutions to a fuchsian differential equation of two singular points while the solutions of one with three regular points will not reduce to elementary functions , but rather can be expressed as a beta integral .",
    "differential equations containing only regular singular points , like the hypergeometric equation , have very little to do with the equations of mathematical physics  @xcite .",
    "although the latter equations have a regular singular point at the origin they possess an essential singularity at infinity that prevents the solution from diverging at infinity .",
    "the regular singular point at the origin has linearly independent solutions , which are powers of the radial coordinate whose exponents are determined by the roots of the indicial equation .",
    "their quotient is an automorphic function , whose inverse is a periodic function , that will undergo a linear - fractional transformation and tessellate the plane with lunes , or curvilinear triangles .",
    "quantum mechanics eliminates one of the solutions on the basis that it blows up at the origin .",
    "however , this depends on the roots of the indicial equation .    because of a finite value of the kinetic energy , the other singular point at infinity is an essential singularity .",
    "the solutions are exponential rising and decaying functions of the radial coordinate . in order that the wavefunction be finite and singlevalued ,",
    "the rising solution is excluded .",
    "the essential singularity arises as a coalescence of two regular singular points , and is analogous to the behavior of an automorphic function in the immediate neighborhood of limit points of the group of motions which tessellate the half - plane or principal circle .",
    "therefore , if we allow for the multivaluedness of the schrdinger equation , its solutions will behave like automorphic functions far from the limit points on the boundary when we consider the limit of zero kinetic energy .    in the next three sections , through the discussion of the phasor angle , the pancharatnam phase of polarized light beams , and the aharonov - bohm phase , we will show that geometric phase requires positive gaussian curvature so that the ratio of the area of a curvilinear triangle to its angular excess is constant .",
    "periodicity with respect to a group of motions tessellate the half - plane , or disc , which are natural boundaries upon which reside essential singularities .",
    "periodicity requires at least two regular singular points , and the elliptic motion is a rotation .",
    "non - integral values of quantum numbers are required in order that the group not reduce to the identity , corresponding to the equivalence class of null paths .",
    "these do not represent particles , whose quantum numbers must be integers , but , rather , are to be associated with resonances .",
    "we then discuss centripetal attraction , for which the angular momentum varies over a continuous range of non - positive , and non - integral values .",
    "the quotient of the solution to the differential equation will take on each value only once in the lune , which is the fundamental region .",
    "this forms a dichotomy with quantum mechanics , where the angular momenta are discrete and space is continuous .",
    "we conclude the paper by reconstructing the original schrdinger equation : for negative kinetic energy the essential singularity is an exponential function , while for positive kinetic energy it is a circular function . as long as the kinetic energy vanishes , the schrdinger equation , even in the presence of a potential , can be reduced to a fuchsian form with multiple space scales .",
    "the linear - fractional transform , @xmath0 guarantees that the fundamental region will have the same number of poles and zeros , where @xmath1 are constants such that @xmath2 .",
    "the difference between the number of zeros , @xmath3 , and the number of poles , @xmath4 , is given by @xmath5 where the contour @xmath6 encloses all zeros and poles .",
    "setting @xmath7 , with @xmath8 given by we find @xmath9 the multipole moment of order @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 the multipole moments are the analogs of essential singularties  @xcite . since equation vanishes for an automorphic function ; there can be no concentration of charges , which are analogs of zeros and poles , so that expresses charge neutrality .",
    "real values of the coefficients in will have the zero fall on the real axis .",
    "the contour in the @xmath12-plane for is a circle passing through the pole at @xmath13 , and zero @xmath14 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] .",
    "the phase @xmath15 at point @xmath16 is the difference between the angle @xmath17 and the exterior angle @xmath18  @xcite , @xmath19 the lines of constant phase are circles which pass through @xmath14 and @xmath13 .",
    "the crucial , and new , point is to realize that by adding @xmath15 to both sides of , and adding and subtracting @xmath20 on the right - hand side give @xmath21 the right - hand side is precisely the angle excess of a spherical triangle .",
    "we will soon appreciate that the phasor is the complementary angle to the pancharatnam phase , , to be discussed in the next section .",

    "[ fig : contour ] , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , correspond to three _ regular _ singular points , which by a linear - fractional transformation can be placed at @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the simplest fuchsian differential equation whose solutions do not reduce to elementary rational functions is one with three singular points . with @xmath17 at the origin ,",
    "@xmath28 at @xmath26 , the phasor @xmath15 will be found at @xmath27 .",
    "the automorphic function , @xmath29 is a beta integral , and satisfies the fuchsian differential equation of second - order : @xmath30 where the prime stands for differentiation with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "the value of the third angle , @xmath15 at @xmath27 , can be determined from the schwarzian deterivative , @xmath31 equating the numerator of the last term with the canonical form  @xcite , @xmath32 we find @xmath33 the negative sign will give the euclidean result , @xmath34 which is the _ negative _ of the phasor , , while the positive root in will give the correct phasor , .",
    "this proves that the phasor belongs to spherical geometry , and not to euclidean geometry .",
    "berry  @xcite claims that pancharatnam s phase  @xcite is one - half the solid angle subtended by a geodesic triangle on the poincar sphere . without even knowing what the pancharatnam phase is , it can safely be ruled out that the phase would be related to an interior solid angle when it is known that all deductions are made on the surface of the poincar sphere with absolutely no knowledge of the interior angles or points that the sphere encompasses  @xcite .",
    "moreover , any shape on the surface of the sphere that has the same area will have the same solid angle , and thus it need not be a geodesic triangle .",
    "in contrast , we will show that the complementary angle found by pancharatnam is equal to half the area of a spherical triangle , given by the angle excess .",
    "pancharatnam considers a polarized beam @xmath35 to be separated into two beams in states of polarization @xmath36 and @xmath37 , whose phase difference is the complementary angle to @xmath15 . in reference to the phasor",
    ", @xmath15 will be equal to the difference in the internal angle @xmath38 and the exterior angle @xmath39 , @xmath40 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : poincare ] . expressing the exterior angle in terms of the interior angle , and adding @xmath41 to both sides of ,",
    "result in @xmath42 equation expresses twice the phase difference between the two beams in terms of the area of a spherical triangle given by its angle excess .",
    "actually , pancharatnam defines @xmath43 as the phase difference which he expresses in terms of the triangle colunar to @xmath44 , namely @xmath45 . this is to say the angle , @xmath46 is the phasor , , being the difference between the opposite internal angle and the external angle of the third angle of the spherical triangle . adding the angle @xmath47 to both sides of , and adding and subtracting @xmath20 on the right - hand side yield : @xmath48 the right - hand side of is the area of the triangle @xmath49 , and replacing the left - hand side by its complementary angle gives @xmath50 which is eqn ( 5.a ) of pancharatnam  @xcite .",
    "is determined by the angle excess of the triangle @xmath51 colunar to @xmath49 . as @xmath52",
    "the the two beams will have opposite phases , while as @xmath53 , which is the opposite state of polarization to @xmath35 , the phase difference will vanish.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as @xmath52 , the phase @xmath54 , and the beams will have opposite phases .",
    "this is analogous to the coalescence of the zero and pole to form a multipole . alternatively , as @xmath53 , the opposite state of polarization to @xmath35 , the beams in the state of polarization @xmath36 and @xmath37 will have zero phase difference .",
    "pancharatman then asks what happens when the split component @xmath37 tends to the opposite polarized state @xmath55 of the other polarized component @xmath36 ?",
    "as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the latter will be given in terms of the area of the lune cut out by the great circles @xmath58 and @xmath59 , which is @xmath60 .",
    "hence , @xmath61 is half the area of the lune formed from the great circles @xmath58 and @xmath62 . when the area vanishes , the beams will have opposite phases , @xmath63 .",
    "[ fig : poincare ] also illustrates pancharatnam s observation that the emergent state of polarization @xmath35 can be obtained from the incident state of polarization @xmath64 when polarized light passes through a birefringent medium , which can be viewed as a rotation of the poincar sphere through an angle @xmath65 in the counterclockwise direction about the @xmath66 axis .",
    "the fringe shift in a field - free , but multivalued , region due to a non - vanishing vector potential was predicted by ehrenberg and siday  @xcite , and rediscovered by aharonov and bohm  @xcite a decade later .",
    "ehrenberg and siday found it strange that an optical phenomenon would be caused by a flux , instead of a _ change _ in the flux .",
    "aharonov and bohm insisted on the multivaluedness of the region in which the beams are travelling .",
    "consider the schrdinger equation with a vector potential , @xmath67 , @xmath68 we want to see how close comes to a fuchsian equation .",
    "it becomes one when the phase transform , @xmath69 is introduced into and the hamiltonian , @xmath70 , is replaced by @xmath71 , which does not produce a trivial , computable phase change in the solution of [ ]  @xcite .",
    "the reason why it is not trivial is because the constant @xmath72 would bring in higher - order poles in the indicial equation and introduce an essential singularity into the schrdinger equation [ cf .",
    "eqn below ] . as we shall show in the last section ,",
    "the elimination of @xmath72 is a necessary condition to keep all singular points regular in the schrdinger equation , .",
    "the radial schrdinger equation then reduces to @xmath73 where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the radial coordinate , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 with a change in the unknown @xmath76 , becomes @xmath77 if @xmath78 satisfies , the coefficient of @xmath79 vanishes in .",
    "rather , if the coefficient of @xmath80 vanishes , @xmath81 , reduces to @xmath82 where @xmath83 is half the schwarzian derivative .",
    "equation is known as the normal form of the equation .",
    "equations with the same normal form are said to be equivalent , and @xmath84 is their invariant  @xcite .",
    "however , for the schrdinger equation , , with coefficients and , the invariant vanishes identically .",
    "therefore , is weakly equivalent to @xmath85  @xcite , and there would be no invariant in the aharonov - bohm effect . any function that has a vanishing schwarzian derivative must be a linear - fractional transformation . and because a non - vanishing schwarzian derivative is curvature  @xcite , we can conclude that is not the correct equation to derive the aharonov - bohm effect  @xcite .",
    "in fact , aharonov and bohm  @xcite consider the wave equation outside the magnetic field region , @xmath86\\psi=0 , \\label{eq : ar}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the wave vector of the incident particle , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the total magnetic flux inside the circuit . by introducing the phase transformation @xmath90 in",
    "we can select a spherically symmetric solution by setting the magnetic quantum number @xmath91 .",
    "equation then becomes the solution found by tamm which is a bessel function for @xmath92 . according to wu and yang  @xcite",
    ", it has no meaningful solution if @xmath93 .",
    "however , it is precisely the equality that allows to be transformed into the fuchsian differential equation , @xmath94 provided @xmath95 .",
    "according to wu and yang , the origin of this term is a monopole in the expression for the angular momentum , @xmath96 but the condition @xmath97 would prevent the formation of a lune .",
    "we will now show their conclusion that the monopole does not possess strings of singularities in the field around it  is inaccurate since analytic continuation about a regular singular point gives rise to a geometric phase .",
    "equation is valid about the singular point at the origin as well as the singular point at infinity .",
    "this can easily be shown by substituting @xmath98 in to get @xmath99 then the substitution @xmath100 , will bring it into the exact same form as .",
    "this shows that the fixed points at @xmath101 and @xmath102 are symmetrical .    the two independent solutions to are : @xmath103 since is multivalued , one solution would have to be rejected to preserve the singlevaluedness of the schrdinger wavefunction . the quotient of the two solutions , , will undergo a linear - fractional transformation since any two independent solutions are linear combinations of any other pair of solutions .",
    "analytic continuation about the origin , or infinity , will not give back the solution we started with .",
    "so by solving we have found functions automorphic with respect to a group of rotations .",
    "the group tessellates the upper half - plane , or disc , by lunes , of the form shown in fig .",

    "the area of the lune is @xmath105 . in terms of the phasor",
    ", the phase angle would be half this area , while panacharatnam gives the phase as the complementary angle .",
    "since we want the phase to vanish with the magnetic flux intensity , we choose the former and get @xmath106 the phase factor , @xmath107 is the change in the wave function during a circuit of the solenoid .",
    "equation says that when @xmath89 is an odd multiple of a fluxon , @xmath108 , the two beams ( one bypasses the toroidal magnetic and the other passes through its hole ) should exhibit a ( maximum ) phase difference of @xmath20 ( mod @xmath109 , i.e. , @xmath110 this is what is seen in the interferogram that results from combining the beam with a coherent reference beam that avoids the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "it is seen that integral quantization of the phase eliminates the phase factor , , altogether .",
    "denote by @xmath111 gauss bracket , which indicates the largest integer not exceeding @xmath112 .",
    "then @xmath113 is an elliptic generator with period @xmath111 .",
    "in other words , there will be @xmath111 distinct branches , or @xmath111 steps  in the spiral staircase .",
    "the different branches are @xmath114 , where @xmath115 are the winding numbers .",
    "each step can be regarded as a covering space corresponding to a particular branch of the multivalued function . in particular , for destructive inference of the beams , @xmath116 , so that there is a single branch , and the surface is simply connected .",
    "many of the equations of mathematical physics can be transformed into fuchsian differential equations at vanishing kinetic energy . consider the spherical bessel equation , @xmath117 which can be transformed into where @xmath118 the bessel equation , , has a regular singular point at @xmath101 , and an essential singularity at @xmath102 .",
    "this can be seen by making the substitution @xmath119 , and noting that the coefficient of @xmath79 has higher - order poles at @xmath120 [ cf .",
    "eqn below ] .",
    "the indicial equation at the regular singular point , @xmath101 , has two independent solutions : @xmath121 the second solution @xmath122 is ordinarily discarded on the basis that it blows up at the origin .",

    "there can be no constant terms appearing in , or the schwarzian derivative [ cf .",
    "eqn below ] .",
    "when @xmath125 , there will be an essential singularity at @xmath126 . we may study this singularity by making the substitution @xmath119 , and as @xmath127 , will reduce to @xmath128 the solution to gives an essential singularity , @xmath129 at @xmath120 which consists of a pole of infinite order .",
    "it is the limit point of two sequences of zeros , one on the positive real , and the other on the negative real , axis  @xcite . since the integrand of is @xmath130 and introducing it into shows that it has a charge  of @xmath131 , a vanishing dipole moment , a quadrupole moment of @xmath132 , a hexadecapole moment of @xmath133 , etc .",
    "the automorphic function , @xmath134 , has the schwarzian derivative , @xmath135 only in case of vanishing kinetic energy , @xmath124 , where @xmath136 .",
    "as we have already shown , the indicial equations will then be identical about @xmath101 and @xmath102 , thereby reducing the second singular point from an essential to a regular one .",
    "this is necessary insofar as the analytic continuation of the solution about the singular point will not give back the solution that we started with , but , the product of analytic continuations about two singular points will give back the original solution .",
    "in other words , the group of rotations needs , at least , two generators whose product is the identity . in the case of two singular points ,",
    "the generators will be inverses of one another .",
    "this is riemann s condition for the periodicity of the function  @xcite , and the group generated by these matrices is the monodromy group , a term coined by jordan .    when the two poles are regular , a simply closed circuit in the counterclockwise direction about @xmath101 , described by the monodromy matrix , @xmath137 must be accompanied by a counterclockwise circuit about the other singular point at @xmath102 , @xmath138 in order that riemann s condition must be fulfilled : @xmath139 so that the motions form a group , the monodromy group .",
    "periodicity results in a multivalued function only for non - integral values of @xmath140 .",
    "integral values would reduce the monodromy matrices , and , to the identity matrix , and destroy the tessellations of the half - plane , or disc , by lunes .",

    "<S> the geometric phase requires the multivaluedness of solutions to fuchsian second - order equations . </S>",
    "<S> the angle , or its complement , is given by half the area of a spherical triangle in the case of three singular points , or half the area of a lune in the case of two singular points . </S>",
    "<S> both are fundamental regions where the automorphic function takes a value only once , and a linear - fractional transformation tessellates the plane in replicas of the fundamental region . the condition that the homologues of the poles , representing vertices , be angles places restrictions on quantum numbers which are no longer integers , for , otherwise , the phase factors would become unity . </S>",
    "<S> restriction must be made to regular singular points for only then will solutions to the differential equation be rational functions so that the covering group will be cyclic and the covering space be a spiral staircase . </S>",
    "<S> many of the equations of mathematical physics , with essential singularities , become fuchsian differential equations , with regular singularities , at zero kinetic energy . </S>",
    "<S> examples of geometric phase include the phasor , the pancharatnam phase of beams of polarized light in different states , the aharanov - bohm phase , and angular momentum with centripetal attraction . in the latter example </S>",
    "<S> , the phase is one - half the area of the lune , which disappears when the pole at infinity becomes an essential singularity thereby recovering the schrdinger equation . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of an automorphic function at a limit point on the boundary is analogous to the confluence of two regular singularities in a linear second - order differential equation to produce an essential singularity at infinity . </S>"
