    "the pierre auger observatory studies high energy cosmic rays in the region of the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff @xcite .",
    "one of the detection methods used is the collection of air fluorescence light generated in the earth atmosphere by extensive airshowers .",
    "currently there are 18 fluorescence telescopes in operation , distributed in 3 `` eyes '' , which overlook the entire surface array .",
    "the last eye is foreseen to be completed in early 2006 .    every eye building houses 6 telescopes , each detecting fluorescence light by means of a camera formed by 440 photomultipliers ( pmts ) , covering a field of view of roughly 30 x 30 degrees .",
    "each pmt works as one pixel to form the complete image of the shower .    to assure the quality of the fd data , it is necessary to follow well defined procedures on data taking and on reporting the problems that might arise .",
    "the study of the background associated with each measurement is important for the sensitivity that the telescopes can achieve .",
    "statistics on different parameters associated with the measurements help identify hardware and software problems or simply calculate the effective measurement time .",
    "this work gives an overview of the efforts made to achieve these goals .",
    "every month , during the period around the new moon , a group of physicists takes care of the fd data taking shift .",
    "they are instructed on how to operate the data aquisition system and then supervised until they get aquainted with the procedure .",
    "all the information that the operators might need during the shift is contained in an internal web page .",
    "there are links to hardware and software manuals , information about the moon fraction , twilight times and weather .",
    "every occurrence during the shift is reported in the fd electronic e - log , accessible from the fd web page .",
    "a template is provided to unify the way of reporting different events .",
    "the contribution to the background signal comes from stars and planet faint light , moon light ( in the field of view or diffuse ) , twilight at the start or the end of the data taking run , lightning , air glow , zodiacal light and man - made light pollution .",
    "the electronic noise comes from the pmts and the electronics chain .",
    "thus , the total background signal is the sum of the sky and electronic background @xmath0        the environment background signal can be studied on an event - by - event basis , looking at pixels not passing the first level trigger ( flt ) @xcite or with special background measurements , by registering the background value every 30 seconds during the data taking . to estimate the electronic noise value , we used the background files acquired with closed shutters every night before data acquisition .",
    "this background measurements last for a few minutes sampling the pixels every 5 seconds .",
    "the direct current induced by the background is eliminated by the ac coupling of the pmt base .",
    "the noise will be generated by the fluctuations of the mean value , which is proportional to the mean number of photons reaching the pmt .",
    "this motivates the present systematic analysis of the variances .",
    "a stand - alone code has been developed to monitor the fd background signal and the detector status for any data acquisition night for all mirrors and telescope sites .",
    "the program can process the background signal in the fd data runs event by event and/or the special background files with closed or open shutters .",
    "the output consists in root @xcite files that can be then analyzed off - line .",
    "it can also plot variances , pedestals , thresholds and pixel hit rates on a nightly basis using an on - line display .    for each event in the fd data runs",
    ", the algorithm extracts the pixel information , including their adc traces . for each trace ,",
    "the mean value ( pedestal ) and the variance are obtained .",
    "only pixels not triggered by flt logic _",
    "( noise pixels ) _ are used while for the special background measurements all pixels in the camera are considered .",
    "( left ) total variance ( sky background + electronic noise ) for telescopes 1 , 2 and 3 in los leones eye for a typical clear moonless night , in terms of distributions ( top ) and color maps ( middle ) , averaged over the whole night .",
