    "what makes a good paper ?",
    "no objective measure is ever going to be perfect but being cited in another paper at least indicates that the work has been noticed and thought to be worth mentioning .",
    "papers with many citations are , in general , likely to be more useful and interesting than those that sink without a trace .",
    "this is much the same system as that used successfully by fast internet search engines to score sites so that they can provide a list ordered by usefulness ; those sites which many people link to get a high score and appear near the top of the returned list .",
    "such a system is admittedly far from perfect , as it can be influenced by many factors such as having a large number of friends who cite you , self - citing your own papers excessively or producing a very good paper that concludes an avenue of research in such a way that it does nt form the basis for a large body of subsequent endeavour .",
    "that said , there is undoubtedly a trend ; papers with high citation counts tend to be better written , more interesting and useful than those that never get referred to again .    in section 2",
    "i first look at citation classics , the 1000 most cited astronomy papers according to the ads .",
    "next i examine the citation counts for refereed astronomy papers published since 1970 . from this",
    "the number of citations received by 1-in-10 , 1-in-100 and 1-in-1000 papers can be obtained , and are shown in table  1 .",
    "the number of citations received by papers of a specified age is also shown , where the age stated defines the centre of a one year range ( so 2 years ago means papers published between 18 and 30 months ago ) .    when can a researcher be said to have a high ongoing impact on the field ?",
    "this question is even harder to answer , but a sequence of well cited papers would be a good start . in section 3",
    "i suggest two measures of current impact on the field which are calculated by tallying up a researchers total citations or normalised total citations over a rolling five year interval .",
    "i calculate these numbers for a random sample of over 5000 astronomers with current publications in order to produce likelihood curves .",
    "quite how a paper passes into folklore and becomes a _ citation classic _ is difficult to determine . to enter the ranks of the 1000 most cited astronomical papers in the ads archive requires a paper to have obtained 257 citations ( as of november 2003 , when the archive contained 439746 papers ) .",
    "for the purposes of this study , papers are defined to be those found in the astronomy / planetary ads archive , published in all refereed journals .",
    "citations counts are those returned by ads .",
    "it should be noted that these citation counts are not complete , with some references omitted because the citing journal is not within the ads database or because an older article has only been scanned at present .",
    "inaccuracies in the citing papers reference list can also lead to missed citations .",
    "the ads does contain complete reference lists for all the major astrophysics journals back to issue 1 .",
    "figure  1 shows the distribution by publication year of the 1000 most cited astronomical papers .",
    "this peaks around 1985 , a year which contributes nearly 50 papers to the total .",
    "it takes around a decade for the number of citation classics per year to rise to over 30 , a figure which tallies well with the 5 year timescale required to reach a maximum citation rate followed by a slow decline ( abt 1981 ) .",
    "the oldest of these ( chandrasekhar 1943 ) , ` stochastic problems in physics and astronomy ' , is a true classic , with over 900 citations , whilst the second oldest ( bondi & hoyle 1944 ) , ` on the mechanism of accretion by stars ' will most likely soon drop out of the list as it ` only ' has 284 citations .",
    "papers published this long ago are likely to have many contemporary citations missed as they have not yet been entered into the archive .",
    "the most recently published additions to the list are ahmad ( 2001 ) ",
    "( for neutrino measurements ) and freedman ( 2001 )  ( measuring the hubble constant ) , with just over 300 citations each .",
    "many of the most highly cited papers in this list are measurements of fundamental parameters - kurucz 1979 , ` model atmospheres for g , f , a , b , and o stars ' , anders & grevesse 1989 , ` abundances of the elements - meteoritic and solar ' , landolt 1992 , ` ubvri photometric standard stars in the magnitude range 11.5 - 16.0 around the celestial equator ' , savage & mathis , 1979 ` observed properties of interstellar dust ' and draine & lee , 1984 , ` optical properties of interstellar graphite and silicate grains ' , are all in the top 10 most cited papers .",
    ".the number of citations required to cross successive power - of - ten likelihoods for papers published a specified number of years ( plus six months ) ago .",
    "the last four rows show the required number of citations and normalised citations ( see text ) required _ per researcher _ to reach the same likelihoods .",
    "[ tab1 ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     how many citations do more normal papers receive ? using the counts in the ads archive i have calculated the likelihood of a paper achieving a specified number of citations for all papers in the archive published since 1970 .",
    "i have also calculated these likelihoods for papers of a specified age , plus or minus six months .",
    "nowadays there are roughly 15,000 papers published per year , falling to 10,000 and 8,500 ten and twenty years ago .",
    "figure  2 shows these likelihoods for a range of ages as well as the long term average ( bold line ) and the required number of citations to cross certain thresholds are given in table  1 .",
    "one - in - ten papers published five years ago has now received 26 citations , with one - in-100 getting more than 91 and one - in-1000 more than 253 citations .",
    "defining a rating system for researchers is a subject fraught with danger as any single proposed scheme is bound to contain inconsistencies .",
    "here i attempt to come up with a scheme that provides a general guideline .",
    "an individual high score on either of the metrics should be subject to further examination and should only be treated as an indication - a researcher in the top few percent of both metrics is likely to be far more widely known than one in the bottom half .",
    "the basis of both schemes described here is to only consider papers published in refereed journals within a rolling five year time interval .",
    "this timespan is set to start five and a half years before the current time and finish six months ago ( as there are almost no citations in the first six months after publication ) .",
    "the citation score is then calculated by summing up the total number of citations for those papers up to the current date using the automatic facility built in to ads .",
    "this procedure is achieved by going to the page ; http://ukads.nottingham.ac.uk/abstract_service.html , typing a name in the author field and ( in november 2003 ) the dates 06/1998 and 05/2003 as the range of publication dates .",
    "the `` select references from '' field needs to be changed to `` all refereed journals '' and sorting done by citation count .",
    "this should return figures for the number of papers found and the total number of citations for those papers .",
    "there will also be an ordered list of the papers , each with its own citation count , although this information is not used here . a second measure , the normalised citation score is calculated by weighting each paper by the number of authors , reducing the impact of large collaborations which often produce a large number of papers .",
    "no attempt is made to remove self citations , however gratuitous ( pearce 2000 ) .",
    "the difficult part of this study is obtaining a useful list of names to feed to the algorithm .",
    "i have taken all the unique names plus first initial contributing two or more items to the ads for authors whose surname starts with a , b or c. in addition , i have also disabled synonym matching on author names , which avoids pattern matching on middle initials and phonetic pronunciation matching",
    ". this procedure will combine authors with names such as martin , a. s. and martin , a. c. together , but such very similar names appear to be rare , at least when both are successful .",
    "i have checked that results near the top of the study suffer no detectable contamination .    the final list of 18,346 names is automatically passed to the ads server which returns citation and normalised citation figures as detailed above .",
    "not all these astronomers have published during the five year period , as the source list of names spans the entire database . in total 5136 , or roughly 30% of the authors",
    "have published two or more refereed papers in the study period .",
    "figures  3 & 4 below show the likelihood of achieving different citation and normalised citation counts respectively , both for all the authors with two or more citations and for the 2467 active researchers who published at least one paper a year over the study period .",
    "as table  1 lists , ten percent of astronomers with two or more refereed papers in the last five years received more than 231 citations , with this figure rising to 382 for active researchers .",
    "similarly , one - in - ten publishing astronomers receive more than 40 normalised citations in the same period .",
    "by extracting citation counts from the ads i have produced a list of the 1000 most cited astronomical papers and produced likelihoods for papers receiving a certain number of citations as a function of the number of years that have elapsed since publication .    in this short work",
    "i have calculated two easily determined measures of success within the astronomical community .",
    "although these numbers should be treated carefully they do at least provide some indication of the impact of a particular researcher on the field and relative to their contemporaries .",
    "the numbers derived here are simply reproducible for any given person and comparisons can be made against the averages for the community as a whole .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system and arose out of discussion with duncan forbes over relevant measures of success for use in funding battles .",
