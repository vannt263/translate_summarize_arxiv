    "there have been many attempts to explain the braking index extracted from observations of pulsar spin - down rates . to date ,",

    "most discussion starts with acknowledgement that there are three possible competing processes , mass emission ( pulsar wind ) , magnetic dipole driven radiation and quadrupole radiation which , taken individually , would lead to braking indices @xmath6 of 1 , 3 and 5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that the quadrupole radiation ( n=5 ) may be neglected ( all values of in table  [ tab:1 ] are between 1 and 3 ) . however , combination of the other two mechanisms has been suggested @xcite .",
    "since the dominant feature of pulsar behavior is the magnetic dipole emission mechanism , it is logical to seek an alternative explanation of the observed braking indices based on the magnetic dipole description .",

    "have explored the possibility that changes in the ellipticity of the pulsar caused by centrifugal stretching , and consequent changes in the moi could contribute substantially .",
    "we found that , given the relatively slow rotational frequencies and the estimated properties of neutron star matter , such changes can produce no appreciable deviation from the mdr value n@xmath1 = 3 for the known pulsars given in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "current understanding of pulsar magnetic fields does not allow for sound speculation as to a change in the strength of magnetic moment m. we are left with time variation of the inclination angle @xmath5 .",

    "@xcite ( lea in future text ) of the best and longest observation of any pulsar ( the crab ) has revealed that the angle @xmath5 for this star may be changing , albeit slowly , towards orthogonality , although lea note that this is a model dependent interpretation of the observed data .",
    "several authors ( e.g. @xcite ) remarked on a possibility that a low braking index can be caused by an increasing the dipolar magnetic field or the change in the inclination angle .",
    "very recently , yi and zhang @xcite showed that , in a model of the braking mechanism the time evolution of @xmath5 could be of importance .",

    "however , to explore the possible range of these parameters , in table  [ tab:1 ] we give the values of @xmath5 found if all pulsars are taken to have the same @xmath2 as the crab and , alternatively , the values of @xmath2 resulting from setting @xmath5 to the crab value .",

    "the two principal potential sources of magnetic field in pulsars that are currently discussed are the dynamo effect , and constituent magnetization arising from the formation of ferromagnetically ordered matter .",
    "the dynamo theory describes the process through which a rotating , convecting , and electrically conducting fluid acts to maintain a magnetic field .",

    "a dipole produced by this mechanism , essentially linked to the rotation of the pulsar , may be expected to be coaxial and centered within the star .",
    "existence of a stable , ferromagnetically ordered region inside the liquid interior of the pulsar has been discussed by many authors in the past ( see e.g. @xcite and ref . therein ) and revived recently @xcite . with pulsar radii",

    "however , the ordered material , mainly located in the core , may have a domain structure which could lead to reduced , local dipoles , neither coaxial nor con - centric with the rotation of the star .",
    "although the magnetic fields may have complicated intrinsic configurations including poloidal and toroidal components @xcite , they are likely dominated by a dipolar term to first approximation .",
    "the assumption of a dipole explains the observed pulse , and the estimated power radiated due to rotation is correct in order of magnitude . however , there is the possibility that the observed dipole radiation is the resultant of more than one dipole .",
    "for example , coexistence of a dipole field due to the dynamo effect , and a field created by the spin - alignment of particles leading to formation of ordered domains could be a possible representation of such a configuration .",
    "other sources of dipoles , such as motion of charged particles in the magnetosphere @xcite can not be excluded , but given the much lower density of the magnetosphere , the resulting moments and fields are likely to be small compared to those in the star . in this paper",

    "we therefore introduce a second version of the model in which we consider the motion to be friction limited .",

    "the mdr model is then able to account for all of the reliably known braking indices , as discussed in section  [ sec2 ] .    as a further comment , noting again that @xmath43 for pulsars is only a fraction ( of order of 10@xmath95 ) of the magnetization of magnetars , our concept is that @xmath43 is a result of possible domain structure in the star core and does not include effect of the crust .",
    "the rotating ( small volume ) magnetized medium may be superfluid neutron pairs . once again we are not aware of any mechanism to estimate rotational friction in such a system .",
    "the origins of magnetism in stars and planets in general , and of pulsars in particular , is a widely discussed topic . while the orders of magnitude of estimated magnetar and pulsar moments can be understood as reasonable compared with the potential moments produced by ordered alignment of the stellar constituents , possibly augmented by the dynamo effect of circulating conducting charged material , no detailed understanding has yet emerged .",
    "lea recently reported that available data on the pulse structure of the crab pulsar suggests the angle of inclination between the dipole moment and rotational axis of the star is increasing . in the light of this finding , we propose that the mechanism of magnetism in pulsars involves two interacting dipoles , and their interaction produces the observed rotation shown by lea .",
    "the physics of their production may be either or both of the dynamo effect and ordering of the intrinsic magnetic moments of the constituents of the star .",
    "an attractive possibility is to associate one dipole with the dynamo effect which is co - rotating with the star and located at its center , with a second dipole , caused by intrinsic alignment and being the source of emitted radiation from the star , at a non - central , off - axis position .",
    "a simple toy model is presented in two versions , both with the center dipole pinned to the axis , one in which the second , off center , dipole can rotate without friction , and the second in which the motion is friction limited .",
    "it is shown that this single mechanism can explain the braking index of all eight well observed pulsars if a relatively slow variation of the angle @xmath5 between the axis of the radiating dipole and the rotational axis of the star is accepted .",
    "basing our estimates on the lea interpretation of observations of the crab pulsar , we have shown , using the toy model with approximations , that the change in the angle @xmath5 can be reproduced .",
    "we have shown further that , if friction is neglected ( as might follow in a superfluid scenario ) , the central dipole required to produce the observed variation of @xmath5 , has a very small value as compared with , for example , full alignment of the constituents of the star .",
    "making the variation of @xmath5 friction limited will lead to an increased central moment requirement , but without knowledge of the friction mechanism we can not estimate how large this would become . if the motion were without friction it should be periodic about some equilibrium orientation of the two dipoles .",
    "friction changes this picture .",
    "it may take centuries of observation to establish a complete picture , which may differ between pulsars .",
    "while many details are missing , we consider the possible two - dipole mechanism suggested here as offering a significant outline explanation of the more salient facts concerning pulsar magnetism .",
    "we note that the toy model is , strictly speaking , applicable for an isolated pulsar in vacuum .",
    "the effect of co - rotating plasma filling the magnetosphere on the spin - down of pulsars has been studied since late 1960 s ( see e.g. @xcite and more recently @xcite ) .",
    "the main consequence of this effect is that it causes additional dissipation of energy from pulsars even when the magnetic axis is aligned with the rotation axis , and thus emission of magnetic dipole radiation does not occur .",
    "however , as stated @xcite , the exact theory of this phenomenon is not yet available , and only empirical approximations were explored .    in a system of two dipoles",
    "there may be a small quadrupole contribution .",
    "the resultant of such an arrangement is a small change in the dominant dipole direction but little change in its magnitude , combined with a small quadrupole moment set perpendicular to the resultant dipole axis .",
    "the power radiated by such a quadrupole , being composed of two opposing dipoles , must be negligible compared with with the dominant dipole radiation and as such would not affect our results .",
    "we have shown that the toy model allows , in principle , both increasing and decreasing @xmath5 , from and towards the rotation axis over time , and can explain braking indices both lower and higher than the canonical value of three yielded by the static mdr model",
    ". this feature may be interesting to follow in the light of recent observation of the braking index of psrj16404631 n@xmath0 = 3.15@xmath150.03 reported by archibald et al .",
