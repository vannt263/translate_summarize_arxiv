    "the interaction of agn jets with their environments has been under investigation for several decades , partly because it is easily observable through the morphology of radio lobes ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and x - ray cavities ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because the most powerful agns are essentially stationary in the centers of galaxy clusters , models of this interaction typically only consider stationary atmospheres that jets run into ( see , e.g. , @xcite for recent work on jets in dynamic atmospheres )",
    "the evolution in this case can be separated into three distinct phases : ( 1 ) the early momentum driven phase , where the ram pressure of the jet is significant for the dynamical evolution and the source evolves into an elongated structure with narrow cocoons , ( 2 ) the energy driven phase , where the slowed - down jet plasma inflates supersonically expanding lobes , excavating a quasi - spherical cavity ( this phase is well described by the self - similar solution by @xcite ) , and ( 3 ) the late , sub - sonic evolution , when the radio lobes ( the reservoirs of relativistic gas released by jets ) are in pressure equilibrium with the environment . in the case of agns ,",
    "this radio plasma is buoyant in the host galaxy / galaxy cluster atmosphere ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a more detailed review ) .",
    "it is becoming increasingly clear that x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) are also producing relativistic jets over a wide range in accretion rate @xcite .",
    "the inner regions of these xrb jets , where their dynamics is governed by the atmosphere of the compact object powering them , are very similar to the inner regions of agn jets @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite showed that some critical differences exist between xrb jets and agn jets in how they interact with the larger scale environment , well outside of the sphere of influence of the central compact object .",
    "one of the differences is that , in comparison with agn jets , the ism poses a much weaker barrier to microquasar jets .",
    "this is because the xrb jet thrust ( in other words , the ram pressure delivered by the jet ) is much larger in comparison to the inertial density of the ism than it is in the case of agn jets .",
    "the second fundamental difference between the two cases is , of course , that xrbs do not reside in the centers of dark matter halos with stratified gaseous atmospheres .",
    "instead , they travel through regular galactic ism with some space velocity @xmath0 , set by supernova kicks and orbital dynamics .",
    "the velocity dispersion of xrbs implies that a significant fraction of these sources are moving with large ( supersonic ) velocities through the ism , which will have important consequences for their dynamics .",
    "vlbi parallax measurements have shown that a microquasars can be moving with velocities in excess of @xmath1 with respect to the local standard of rest @xcite . as a result",
    ", the ram pressure of the ism will act on the radio plasma released by the source , sweeping back the outer layers of the radio lobe .    in this paper , we argue that this aspect has important consequences for the interaction of some xrb jets with their environment : instead of inflating stationary cocoons , in many cases they will produce trails of radio emitting plasma ( made up of relativistic particles and magnetic fields ) as they travel through the galaxy .",
    "a very similar situation is encountered in pulsar bow shock nebulae @xcite , where a relativistic wind inflates a channel in the ism through which the pulsar is moving , and , of course , in exragalactic head - tail sources , which are the direct equivalent of jets propagating into a moving medium .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : dynamics ] , we will present a simple parametric model of the interaction of the jets with the ism . in  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the consequences for particle and magnetic field input into the ism ,  [ sec : observations ] discussed the observational signatures of this interaction , and  [ sec : summary ] presents a brief summary of the paper .",
    "no detailed , global models of the dynamical interaction of xrb jets with the ism exist as of yet . in the absence of such models , the first logical step is to explore a relatively simple sketch of how this interaction occurs .",
    "the predictions we will make are based on what we know about the interaction of agn jets with their environment , some insight gained from the scaling relations derived in @xcite and on the estimates of the kinetic energy output from these source derived in @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hg05 hereafter ) .    throughout the paper",
    ", we will assume that the dynamical time of the large scale evolution of the source is long compared to the variability time scale of the xrb and the jet ( see  [ sec : early ] ) .",
    "this will allow us to neglect the variable nature of the jet power in the long term evolution of the large scale radio lobe and instead use a time averaged constant value .",
    "based on the estimated power @xmath2 of the jet in cyg x-1 from @xcite , and loosely guided by the limit on the average jet power of @xmath3 from hg05 , we adopt a fiducial ensemble average kinetic jet power _ per source _ of @xmath4    we will also use the estimated average aggregate power from _ all _ xrb jets of @xmath5 this estimate does _ not _ include the even more uncertain contributions from neutron star jets or optically thin radio outbursts , both of which will increase the total power and thus the importance of the effects discussed here .",
    "we will further assume that the gas is sufficiently ionized or sufficiently dense to treat the magnetized plasma released by the jet and its environment as fluids and use hydrodynamic arguments ( see  [ sec : mixing ] ) .",
    "we will use a set of fiducial parameters for the ism .",
    "since the ism itself is turbulent and inhomogeneous we can not simply assign a mean density .",
    "we will discuss the three putative main phases ( cold , warm , and hot ) separately whenever appropriate .",
    "the ism pressure is likely dominated by turbulent pressure and contains contributions from thermal and non - thermal particles and magnetic fields .",
    "we will use a fiducial mean total ism pressure of @xcite @xmath6    we will assume throughout the paper that the working surface , i.e. , the place where jet and ism interact directly , slowing down the jet material ( taken to be a strong terminal shock ) is efficient at slowing the jets down to sub - relativistic velocities and thus dissipating most of the kinetic energy into internal energy of the radio plasma . for a jet with length @xmath7 and half opening angle @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the opening angle measured in degrees ) , this is the case for @xmath10 where we define the ism particle density as @xmath11 .",
    "the size scales we are interested in are much larger than this , so we are justified in assuming the working surface dissipates most of the kinetic energy .",
    "we will also assume that this plasma does not mix with the ism due to magnetic flux freezing ( see , however , ",
    "[ sec : mixing ] ) .      during the early lobe evolution",
    "the ism pressure @xmath12 , buoyancy forces , and the ism ram pressure @xmath13 due to the space velocity @xmath0 of the xrb are negligible compared to the ram pressure @xmath14 on the lobe due to its radial expansion velocity @xmath15 .",
    "it is then appropriate to use the well - known 1-dimensional energy - driven bubble model @xcite as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : sketch ] .",
    "this model assumes that the xrb releases relativistic plasma in a spherically symmetric fashion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where @xmath16 is the solid angle swept out by precession and jitter of the jet axis .",
    "]    assuming ( a ) an adiabatic equation of state , ( b ) uniform pressure for the radio plasma inside the lobe , ( c ) ram pressure balance with the ism , and ( d ) energy conservation , the castor solution is @xmath17    apart from the expected synchrotron emission from inside the radio lobe , the supersonic expansion into the ism will also lead to thermal emission from the shocked ism shell @xcite , similar to expanding supernova remnants .",
    "shocks are extremely valuable as diagnostic tools , since the shock strength measures the expansion velocity of the source , which , when coupled with the source size , can tell us the age and average kinetic power of the source .",
    "an example of such a source is cyg x-1 , for which this thermal emission has been detected @xcite .      at sufficiently late times",
    "( the case we are interested in here ) the jets will have traveled sufficiently far for the dynamical pressure due to the xrb motion to become important .    the dynamical pressure of the xrb motion through the ism with velocity @xmath0 will become comparable to the jet thrust ( i.e. , the momentum flux along the jet ) when the advance speed of the working surface equals the space velocity of the source , @xmath18 .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , the working surface can no longer advance in the direction of the jet and will thus become stationary in the frame of the xrb .",
    "given our fiducial sound speed of @xmath19 we will express the xrb s space velocity as @xmath20    the shock jump conditions and pressure balance across the working surface ( the terminal shock ) imply that this happens when the jet thrust @xmath21 equals the total dynamic pressure @xmath22\\right\\}/37    \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of the ism , where @xmath23 is the effective mach number of the xrb s motion through the ism with respect to the effective sound speed of the ism , @xmath24 .",
    "we adopt a fiducial value of @xmath25 for the bulk lorentz factor of the jet , which is , however , of little importance throughout the rest of the paper .    the expression for @xmath26 in eq .  ( [ eq : pdyn ] )",
    "can easily be derived from the shock jump conditions on each side of the working surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with non - relativistic equations of state for the unshocked cold jet and ism gas equation of state is not a crucial assumption and can easily be modified to reflect a relativistic equation of state of the jet gas ( for example ) .",
    "the coefficients only change slightly and the qualitative results are unaltered . ] .    the two dynamical pressures @xmath26 and @xmath27 are equal when the length of the jets reaches @xmath28^{1/2 }    \\label{eq : length}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expression in brackets is unity for @xmath29 and the fiducial parameters and @xmath30 .",
    "at this length , the working surface becomes stationary in the frame of the xrb , and since the ism is moving at velocity @xmath0 with respect to the xrb , the plasma that is released at the working surface must be swept back away from the xrb with the ism at velocity @xmath0 and create a trail of `` debris '' plasma , left behind by the xrb jets .",
    "the time for the jet to propagate that far into the ism is approximately @xmath31 , which is long compared to typical accretion disk time scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but still short compared to typical companion ( i.e. , xrb ) lifetimes .",
    "it is therefore necessary to further discuss this quasi stationary phase of the large scale dynamics of radio plasma released by xrbs ( it is quasi stationary since the xrb space velocity @xmath0 and the local ism density @xmath32 change as the xrb traverses the galaxy ) .",
    "as mentioned above , we assume that the working surface is stationary in the frame of the xrb .",
    "its propagation velocity into the ism must therefore be @xmath0 and its pressure must be given by @xmath33 from above .",
    "the energy released by the jet at the working surface must then equal the jet power : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the volume of plasma streaming out of the working surface .",
    "the factor @xmath36p_{\\rm dyn}$ ] is the post - shock enthalpy of the jet plasma and includes both the internal energy @xmath37 of the plasma released and the @xmath38 work done on the ism . since @xmath39 for the jet plasma , the volumetric rate at which jet plasma is released at the working surface is @xmath40    since far downstream ( along the swept back trail of radio plasma away from the source ) the pressure has to equal the ism pressure ( otherwise the energy in the mach cone behind the xrb would diverge ) , the radio plasma originally released at pressure @xmath26 must expand adiabatically ( thus doing further work on the ism ) . thus , the asymptotic volumetric rate at which plasma enters the trail is @xmath41    in order to estimate the asymptotic lateral radius @xmath42 of the trail ( approximated as a cylinder around the xrbs trajectory ) from its inflation rate ( eq .  [ eq : dvdt ] ) , we need to know the asymptotic flow velocity @xmath43 of radio plasma through the trail",
    ". the pressure gradient behind the bow shock ( from the ism ram pressure @xmath26 to @xmath12 ) will accelerate the plasma along the channel .    in principle , it is possible that the plasma will pick up most of its original outflow velocity and reach mildly relativistic speeds . for example , @xcite investigated the dynamics of pulsar bow shock nebulae using axi - symmetric 2.5d relativistic mhd simulations and found that the velocity inside the channel reaches values up to @xmath44 .",
    "they concluded , on the basis of their simulations , that the channel width should be comparable to the standoff distance between the pulsar ( or xrb in our case ) and the stagnation point at the head of the shock .",
    "however , the enforced symmetry in their model makes the solution they found over - stable . in reality , it is likely that dynamical instabilities ( e.g. , kelvin - helmholtz or kink instabilities , depending on the strength and topology of the magnetic field ) would disrupt such rapid flow through the channel .",
    "we expect the average flow velocity to be roughly that of the ism sheet around the channel .",
    "asymptotically , this velocity must be @xmath0 ( otherwise the total kinetic energy would diverge ) .",
    "thus , we will assume that the plasma , far downstream from the xrb will have a flow velocity of @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "note that even in the case of @xmath47 , the plasma must still come to rest in the ism at some point , where it would inflate a bubble .",
    "this would be around the birthplace of the xrb or around any major change in environmental parameters ( i.e. , changes in ism density or pressure ) , where the channel width would change significantly , leading to a series of `` sausage link '' bubbles , connected by narrow channels .",
    "note also that the total volume of plasma released should not be affected .",
    "the equilibrium radius @xmath42 of the roughly cylindrical trail is then @xmath48    this is much larger than the value of @xmath7 ( eq .  [ eq : length ] ) .",
    "thus , the ultimate cross section of the trails is much larger than the equilibrium length of the jets and our assumption that both jets are feeding a single trail is justified ( this is not qualitatively important for our argument , however ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out the implicit weak dependence of @xmath42 on density through @xmath49 which implies that the size scale of the trails produced should be similar in different environments - an increase in density by three orders of magnitude ( with otherwise identical parameters , i.e. , pressure and jet power ) only reduces @xmath42 by a factor of 3.5 , while a decrease in density by three orders of magnitude ( i.e. , a hot ism phase environment ) only increases @xmath42 by a factor of 1.3 .",
    "thus , the most significant effects on @xmath42 are likely to come from @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .    for a binary lifetime of @xmath53 ( where @xmath54 is the age of the source in units of @xmath55 yrs ) , the length of the trail left by the source is @xmath56 based on this expression , a source will produce a significant plasma trail if @xmath57 , or @xmath58 if this condition is not satisfied , the source dynamics are better approximated as spherical and stationary ( if significant gradients exist in the environment of the xrb , the source evolution will , of course , still deviate from a quasi - spherical , symmetric case , as might be the case in cygnus x-1 ) .",
    "the fiducial values used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trailcondition ] ) are appropriate for lmxbs , implying that lmxbs typically leave trails in the ism , especially the high velocity tail of the lmxb population with @xmath59 . since hmxbs have low space velocities and short lifetimes , this condition is typically _ not _",
    "satisfied for hmxbs : for a characteristic hmxb velocity of @xmath60 and a companion lifetime of @xmath61 , the expression on the left is @xmath62 .",
    "thus , hmxbs typically should _ not _ produce trails , except for very low power source , and sources in the very high velocity tail of the hmxb distribution in dense , high pressure environments ( such as the galactic center ) .    in arguments",
    "above we have implicitly assumed that a fluid treatment is valid , i.e. , that the relativistic particles released by the jet interact collectively with the ism . this is equivalent to assuming that the particles are frozen to the plasma and that microscopic mixing between ism and trail plasma is not a dominant effect .",
    "we will discuss this assumption and its validity in more detail in [ sec : mixing ] .",
    "any significant amount of mixing will only make the conclusions we will draw below about seeding of magnetic fields into the ism stronger ( however , it might alter the observation appearance of trails as well ) .",
    "given the estimates for the properties of the radio lobes and trails produced by the ensemble of galactic xrbs , we can estimate their impact on the ism . before going into detail",
    ", we will lay out our assumptions about the ism that the xrbs are interacting with :    for the xrb velocities , we will use a maxwellian distribution with mean velocities of @xmath63 and @xmath64 for hmxbs and lmxbs respectively , which reproduces the scale heights of both populations .",
    "a fraction of about @xmath65 of the lmxbs reside in the galactic disk .    for the ism density distributions we will use volume filling fractions of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 for the hot , warm , and cold phases respectively @xcite .",
    "we will assume that lmxbs are randomly distributed among the three phases since they are old enough to have moved far enough away from their birth places to have forgotten about their initial environments .",
    "hmxbs do not live long enough and have velocities too small to have traveled very far from their birth place , about 60pc for @xmath69 and a life time of @xmath70 .",
    "this has to be compared to typical molecular cloud size of about 100pc .",
    "we will thus assume that @xmath71 for hmxbs to be conservative ( smaller values of @xmath72 will lead to larger values of the total volume of plasma released by hmxbs below ) .",
    "the total volume in radio trails produced by xrbs depends on the distribution of @xmath0 and @xmath73 only through @xmath74 .",
    "thus , estimates of the volume of plasma released by jets will be robust against uncertainties in those quantities .    with the ism parameters given above",
    ", the volume in trails produced by the lmxb disk population is simply the current rate of volume injection per lmxb , averaged over the velocity distribution of lmxbs , multiplied by the number of lmxbs , multiplied by the age of the lmxb population @xmath75 yrs .    using the estimated total integrated kinetic power of the lmxb population of @xmath76 ,",
    "this gives : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is unity for our fiducial parameters and a very slowly varying function of @xmath79 , and @xmath80 over the parameter range considered .",
    "the velocity dispersion @xmath81 drops out of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vollmxb ] ) to lowest order .",
    "clearly , the most uncertain parameter left is @xmath82 , on which @xmath83 depends linearly .",
    "taking @xmath84 for the halo population , the volume produced by the halo lmxbs is about @xmath85 .",
    "however , a sizeable fraction of the plasma produced in the disk will eventually leak into the halo ( see below ) . since @xmath51 is much smaller in the halo than it is in the disk , the total volume filled by plasma released by halo lmxbs and that emanating buoyantly from the disk ( see below ) is thus likely much larger than this estimate .",
    "for the hmxbs , the total volume rate should be integrated over the star formation rate history , assuming a current star formation rate of @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 is the galactic star formation rate in units of 3 solar masses per year ) .    with the slightly lower value of the total power @xmath88 and the total star formation rate integral of @xmath89 ( where @xmath90 is the galactic stellar mass in units of @xmath91 solar masses ) ,",
    "this gives @xmath92 again @xmath93 is slowly varying .    summarizing , the total volume of radio plasma released into the disk by xrb jets over the lifetime of the galaxy is then roughly @xmath94 , and the volume released by halo lmxbs is roughly @xmath95 .",
    "this should be compared to the disk and the halo volumes : taking the disk scale height to be 500 pc and the disk radius to be 10 kpc , the disk volume is @xmath96 , while the halo volume is roughly @xmath97 .",
    "clearly , xrbs will have released sufficient relativistic plasma to fill a significant fraction of the disk and even the halo .",
    "if the radio plasma were confined to the disk , it would fill up to 100% of the disk ( and could account for all of the hot ism phase in the disk ) .",
    "this immediately implies that the buoyancy of this plasma in the vertically stratified galactic gas will eventually move most of the trails out into the halo .",
    "it also implies that a volume fraction larger than 10% of the halo might be filled with radio plasma produced by xrbs .",
    "we will discuss further implications of this result below .",
    "microscopic mixing of radio plasma and ism is only going to be important in sufficiently neutral ism phases , since otherwise the strong magnetization of the trail plasma will effectively decouple both phases .",
    "while the ism will be sufficiently ionized near the working surface , it might well be neutral far back ablong the trail . in this case",
    ", neutral particles can enter the trail . the cross section for collisional interaction between the neutral particles and the cosmic rays of",
    "the trail is negligible .",
    "thus , the only way for neutral ism particles to interact at all with the trail plasma is through interaction with ionized ism particles via ambipolar diffusion and charge exchange reactions ( we will ignore the latter given the expected low cross sections ) .",
    "while a detailed discussion of microscopic mixing of relativistic plasma across radio lobe boundaries is beyond the scope of this paper , we will briefly present an order of magnitude estimate of the importance of ambipolar diffusion of neutral ism into xrb radio lobes and trails to show that the exptected amount of mixing is astrophysically interesting .",
    "following @xcite , we use a constant ion drag coefficient of @xmath98 . in the cold neutral phase",
    ", it is appropriate to use an ionization fraction of @xmath99 with @xmath100 @xcite . in the warm neutral medium ,",
    "the ionization fraction is higher , of order @xmath101 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "next , we need to estimate the field strength inside the trail . given the estimated pressure and size of the plasma trail , we can parameterize the field strength in terms of its equipartition value , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the ratio of magnetic to particle pressure and @xmath104 is the total ( particle plus magnetic ) pressure . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume the field is tangled isotropically , leading to the additional factor of @xmath105 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the ambipolar diffusion coefficient for cold neutrals entering the trail / lobe is then ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath106 and for warm neutrals @xmath107 we are interested in the asymtotic mixing fraction far back along the trail , when it has reached its equilibrium radius .",
    "thus , we will not consider dynamical effects due to the trails initial expansion on the total mixing fraction .",
    "a conservative assumption about the longevity of the radio trail is that it will last at least one sound crossing time against any dynamical instabilities ( see  [ sec : destruction ] ) . within a sound crossing time @xmath108 ,",
    "the ambipolar diffusion length is @xmath109 thus , a lower limit to the mixing fraction of thermal material from the cold neutral phase into radio trails / lobes produced by microquasars is @xmath110 and for warm neutrals @xmath111 we conclude that , for the warm and cold neutral ism , the magnetic field inside the trail presents only a moderate barrier and mixing could be relatively efficient , quickly creating a boundary layer of a few percent thickness around the trail / lobe . at the same time , ambipolar diffusion is probably not strong enough to affect the dynamics of the radio plasma on a global scale .    in conclusion",
    ", mixing is significant in the neutral ism phases , with mixing fractions of order of a few percent .",
    "it is likely orders of magnitude smaller for xrbs in ionized environments .",
    "this suggest that the global average of @xmath112 should be about a factor of 10 smaller than the volume filling fraction of neutral gas in the galaxy .",
    "so , given recent estimates of volume filling factor of up to 40% for the warm neutral phase @xcite we `` guesstimate '' a globally averaged mixing fraction of order @xmath113 .",
    "as the radio plasma expands into the ism a number of processes will compete to either mix the two phases or remove the plasma from the galactic disk into the halo .",
    "the ism is vertically stratified due to the gravitational field of the galaxy .",
    "the low density radio trails are buoyantly unstable in this gas , which will drive them upward , away from the galactic plane",
    ".    the buoyancy time scale for a cylindrical trail of radius @xmath114 is set by the downward ism dynamical pressure and the upward buoyancy of the radio plasma . for a galactic rotation velocity @xmath115 ( which sets the vertical gravity @xmath116 ) , a galacto - centric distance of @xmath117 ( where @xmath118 is the galacto - centric distance in units of @xmath119 ) , and a vertical trail position @xmath120 above the galactic mid - plane ( where @xmath121 is the trail height in units of 200pc ) , and assuming a drag coefficient @xmath122 of about 1 for a cylindrical trail , the buoyancy speed is @xmath123    for a disk scale height of @xmath124 , the buoyancy time is @xmath125 which is ,",
    "be default , longer than a sound crossing time ( since buoyancy is always sub - sonic ) .",
    "this is comparable to the lifetime of an hmxb , but could be short compared to the lifetime of an lmxb .",
    "unhindered , this process will eventually remove all of the radio plasma from the disk into the halo .",
    "however , a number of processes will work against this transport out of the plane , trying to mix the relativistic plasma into the ism . in order to estimate their importance",
    ", one needs to compare the time scales over which they act to the buoyancy time .",
    "if they are occurring on more rapid time scales , they might mix a significant amount of radio plasma macroscopically with the ism before it has time to escape into the halo , especially because all of these processes will only increase the trails surface area and thus its buoyancy time . at the same time , an increase in surface area will also increase the microscopic mixing fraction @xmath112 .",
    "due to the differential rotation of the galaxy , any object of finite size will experience galactic shear .",
    "since the radio trails are embedded in the ism , they will be affected .",
    "taking the galactic rotation velocity @xmath126 to be constant with radius , the angular velocity shear across the trail is @xmath127 .",
    "the shredding time for an object much smaller than its galacto - centric distance @xmath128 that is subject to this shear is @xmath129 independent of the actual size of the object .",
    "after several shredding times the object will have been significantly stretched and distorted and will eventually be mixed with the ism .",
    "note that the shredding time is approximately equal to the buoyancy time , so for an xrb in the galactic plane , it is plausible that shredding will distort , and possibly even destroy the radio trail before it can escape into the halo .",
    "in addition to shear - shredding , the trails will also be subject to dynamical instabilities . the same buoyancy process that drives the trails out of the galactic plane",
    "will also trigger the formation of rayleigh - taylor instability , acting to destroy the trail and macroscopically mix the radio plasma with the ism .",
    "the growth time for a mode with wave number @xmath130 is @xmath131 ( for large density contrast between trail and ism ) .",
    "since the trails are filled with magnetized plasma , magnetic tension will suppress the growth of small wavelength modes .",
    "however , global modes will likely not be suppressed by tangled fields ( at least in the linear regime ) , and so the growth time for a body mode with wave number @xmath132 will be @xmath133 with @xmath134 being the drag coefficient .",
    "thus , rt instability will set in well before buoyancy had time to remove the plasma out of the disk and into the halo .",
    "if rt instability does grow at the hydrodynamic rate , it will fragment the radio trails into smaller pockets , which will be subject to further rt instability .",
    "( [ eq : rt ] ) shows that rt instability is more efficient the smaller the size of the plasma pocket , thus , _",
    "if _ rt instability is not suppressed on scales comparable to @xmath42 by the presence of large scale magnetic fields , it will destroy the radio trail into a spectrum of bubbles small enough for magnetic tension to stabilize them before buoyancy transports the plasma out of the disk .",
    "since the buoyancy time of smaller bubbles is longer , the rt fragmentation will delay buoyant transport and give other processes more time to act and , by increasing the surface area of the plasma , increasing the efficiency of diffusive processes .",
    "in addition to rt instability , galactic differential rotation and buoyancy drift will induce kh instability along the edge of the trail .",
    "the typical velocities encountered are of order @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "@xmath137 will dominate at early times , @xmath138 will become larger after a few buoyancy times . taking the relativistic inertia of the radio plasma into account ,",
    "the kh growth time of a body mode with @xmath139 is roughly @xmath140 clearly , the ratio @xmath141 is much larger than either @xmath142 or @xmath143 for typical trail radii ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : req ] ) , and kh instability should not contribute much to the global destruction of radio bubbles and trails .",
    "however , it could well induce a spectrum of short wavelength modes that creates a shear layer around the trail , where efficient mixing between the two phases occurs .",
    "given the total volume of plasma released by xrbs and some value of @xmath112 , we can estimate the strength of the magnetic field that is released and seeded into the ism .",
    "we will use the expression for the field strength inside the trail from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bfield ] ) . further assuming magnetic flux conservation , the strength of the magnetic field after the residual fraction @xmath112 of the radio plasma is mixed with the ism is @xmath144 where @xmath145 is unity for the set of fiducial parameters .",
    "since @xmath146 and @xmath90 enter linearly into this expression , the magnetic field provided by xrb jets will have been linearly increasing as a function of time for most of the galactic history , but will have been increasing more rapidly during intense star formation episodes , when @xmath147 increased dramatically , since then the hmxb population would have been much more numerous .",
    "this should be compared to an estimated mean galactic field of order @xmath148 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the seed field required to produce the observed galactic field is rather small ( @xmath151 * ? ? ?",
    "even under the most conservative assumptions possible  mixing of only one skin depth of the thickness of one proton gyro radius ( @xmath152 )  such a field strength could have been provided by xrb jets within about @xmath153 after the first xrbs turned on ( though it would need a few galactic revolutions of duration @xmath154 to get spread over a significant fraction of the disk ) .",
    "more reasonable choices of @xmath112 imply that the strength of the seed field provided by xrb jets is likely orders of magnitude larger .",
    "in fact , given the numbers derived above , is likely that the strength of the field seeded by xrb jets is only about two orders of magnitude below the observed mean galactic value .    of particular importance in this case is the fact that lmxbs travel far from their birthplaces , leaving behind trails of magnetized plasma , which should permeate the galactic plane more or less uniformly ( modulated by the average space density as a function of galacto - centric distance ) .    since xrb production is an unavoidable part of star formation @xcite and since jet activity is an integral part of xrb activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is clear that jets must play a role in providing magnetic fields in forming galaxies and the cumulative effect of xrbs on the ism implies that they are likely responsible for a non - negligible fraction of the field in mature galaxies as well .    along with the magnetization ,",
    "it is clear that relativistic particles from within the lobe will mix into the interstellar medium as cosmic rays .",
    "this process was discussed in more detail in @xcite .",
    "a critical question raised in that paper was the adiabatic cooling of these particles .",
    "the pressure inside the working surface has already been estimated in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pdyn ] ) and the pressure inside the trail / lobe to which the cosmic ray plasma has to expand is simply the ism pressure .    taking the bulk of the particles leaving the working surface to have energies comparable to the randomized specific kinetic energy of the jet , i.e. , @xmath155 ,",
    "the final energy of any cosmic ray protons in the trails is @xmath156 indicating that adiabatic losses are likely small enough to leave the results regarding the total energetic of cosmic ray injection by microquasars discussed in @xcite unchanged : the total energetics of microquasars is likely to contribute of order a few percent to the galactic cosmic ray population .",
    "thus , microquasars located in the vicinity of molecular clouds should be observable through gamma - ray emission due to hadronic interaction with the cloud protons detectable by glast .",
    "a corollary of this process is gev neutrino emission that should also arise",
    ". the high energy tail from this emission might be detectable with high energy neutrino detectors like ice cube .",
    "given the estimated pressure and size of the plasma trails and working surfaces ( i.e. , hot spots ) , we can estimate their synchrotron luminosity and surface brightness .",
    "we once again use the expression from eq .",
    "( [ eq : bfield ] ) to parameterize the field strength .",
    "since it is unclear what the composition of the plasma is ( @xmath157 vs.  @xmath158 ) , we parameterize the proton pressure as @xmath159 $ ] , where @xmath160 is the ratio of proton to lepton pressure .      while the field strength we estimate for the trails is not much larger than the mean galactic field , it is safe to assume that the partial pressure from relativistic electrons inside the trails is larger than outside , implying that the trails will produce synchrotron emission that is significantly enhanced over the mean galactic emission .    for a powerlaw distribution of electrons with index @xmath161 such that @xmath162 , the synchrotron emissivity of the plasma is @xcite @xmath163    the magnetic field strength inside the trail is approximately @xmath164 , which gives a cooling time of @xmath165^{3/2}\\nu_{5}^{-1/2}\\ ] ] for an electron emitting at frequency @xmath166 . the length of radio trail a particle can travel before cooling losses affect it is @xmath167^{3/2}\\frac{v_{17}{\\mathcal{v}}}{\\nu_{5}^{1/2}}\\ ] ] which is comparable to @xmath42 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : req ] ) .",
    "thus , the trails left behind by xrbs should typically only emit at frequencies well below 5ghz . above such frequencies ,",
    "the radio emission from xrbs should be concentrated around the xrb itself . given their large angular sizes and low frequency emission",
    ", these trails will be ideal targets for the new wave of high fidelity , low frequency radio arrays , such as lofar , the lwa , the mwa , and , ultimately , the ska  low .    the central surface brightness of a given trail within a cooling distance @xmath168 from the xrb will be @xmath169^{\\frac{7}{4}}\\frac{2p_{-11.5}^{\\frac{5}{4 } } \\xi_{\\rm        b}^{\\frac{3}{4}}}{1 + \\xi_{\\rm p } }        \\sqrt{\\frac{w_{37.3}}{\\nu_{5}v_{17}{\\mathcal{v } } } } r_{m}^{-\\frac{1}{8 } }        \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and",
    "the integrated trail luminosity at a fixed frequency is @xmath170    while every microquasar should have some kind of radio lobe / trail in its vicinity , some sources will be better suited to study this effect than others .",
    "cygnus x-1 , for example , is already known to possess a dark radio lobe . as an hmxb with a relatively young age , it is unlikely to show much of a radio trail , as argued above , and indeed , the radio lobe seems to be close to the source , though it does show a one - sided asymmetry : the radio ring surrounding it that led to the claim of the radio lobe is one - sided .",
    "this asymmetry could be due to the fact the source is located at the border of a high density cloud .",
    "arguably one of the best sources to look for a radio trail is xte j1118 + 480 , which is known to have both a steady low / hard state jet as well as a large space velocity @xcite .",
    "we suggest that this should be one of the first targets to study with low frequency , large scale radio mapping for evidence of a plasma trail .",
    "the large scale , asymmetric radio emission recently detected surrounding cygnus x-3 @xcite is also suggestive and we interpret it as dynamical interaction with the ism .",
    "the overall morphology suggests that the source is moving in a roughly northern direction relative to the ism .",
    "this should be followed up with vlbi proper motion measurements of the xrb itself to test this hypothesis .",
    "given the estimate of the jet length @xmath7 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : length ] ) and the pressure inside the working surface , we can estimate the order of magnitude of the synchrotron emission from each hot spot as @xmath171 .",
    "once the plasma has moved out of the working surface of a jet , it expands ( i.e. , cools ) adiabatically and reaches pressure equilibrium with the lobe .",
    "the pressure inside the hot spot is given by @xmath172 giving an approximate the hot spot luminosoity of @xmath173    for typical microquasar parameters , the synchrotron cooling time @xmath174 for x - ray emitting electrons is longer than the adiabatic cooling time and the same expression should hold for radio as well as x - ray synchrotron emission .",
    "this flux is accessible with _",
    "chandra _ and in fact has been observed in a number of cases , most notably xte j1550 @xcite . in the case of xte j1550 ,",
    "the hot spot has been observed to move away from the xrb at mildly relativistic speeds , which fits in well with the picture developed here : if the jet power rises sharply , as indicated by the radio flares that precede the detection of the hot spots , the working surface will ( a ) brighten and ( b ) move outward , decelerating as it moves into undisturbed ism .",
    "the distances where the hot spots are observed are consistent with where we would expect them from equation ( [ eq : length ] ) .      as has been discussed in the literature @xcite , and as is observed around radio galaxies in clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the source will sweep up a quasi - spherical shell during its initial inflation .",
    "this shell will emit thermal bremsstrahlung , potentially up to x - ray energies , as well as line emission from the shocked plasma .    for the early , quasi - spherical evolution and for stationary source",
    ", we refer the reader to the discussion in the context of expanding shells in galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and binaries @xcite and concentrate on the emission from the ism swept up ahead of radio trails in the case of xrbs with appreciable space velocity .    given that lmxb space velocities top out at a few hundred km / s , we should expect temperatures up to about a kev , which should be detectable by x - ray telescopes ( which is also the case in pulsar - wind nebulae ) .",
    "the radiative cooling time strongly depends on the ism density , but assuming that the shock is fully radiative gives an upper limit on the total luminosity from the swept up ism of @xmath175 spread over a region close to a degree in size ( thus hard to detect with the typical field of view of current x - ray instruments ) .",
    "longer wavelengths seem more suitable for finding these thermal sources ( specifically , narrow band imaging of prominent shock - excited lines on degree scales , as well as broad - band imaging to look for free - free emission * ? ? ?",
    "given that the estimated expansion velocity of the shell around cyg x-1 is of order a few dozen km / s , we would expect surface brightness and total power to be comparable with those detected in the cyg x-1 nebula .",
    "this suggests that asymmetric bow shock emission might be a suitable way to identify sources for low frequency follow up .",
    "we proposed that jets from x - ray binaries ( microquasars ) leave behind trails of non - thermal , synchrotron emitting plasma as they move through the interstellar medium .",
    "lmxbs are more likely to leave such trails due to their longer life expectancy and , more importantly , due to the higher expected space velocities , while hmxbs likely produce more stationary radio lobes .",
    "the total plasma volume deposited by xrbs over the history of the galaxy is comparable to the total disk volume and constitutes a non - negligible fraction of the halo volume .",
    "we argue that a fraction @xmath112 of order a few percent of this plasma is mixed into the thermal ism .",
    "the magnetic field thus released can easily provide the seed field for galactic dynamos to produce the fields observed in spiral galaxies even under the most conservative assumptions .",
    "since hmxbs turn on rapidly after an episode of star formation , this mechanism should be important for galactic magnetic field production and maintenance within a time frame of about @xmath70 from the first supernovae .",
    "we showed that radio emission from the plasma inside the trail should be visible primarily at low frequencies , since the radiative cooling time of the plasma at ghz frequencies limits emission to a roughly spherical region around the binary .",
    "lofar , mwa , lwa and other future low frequency , wide field instruments are ideally suited for searches of this emission .",
    "lmxbs with high detected proper motions like xte j1118 + 480 will be the best candidates for such a search ."
