    "although studies of spiral galaxies commonly assume an axisymmetric equilibrium state , possibly perturbed by spiral arms , there is growing evidence that many galaxies lack this symmetry .",
    "based on optical appearance , approximately @xmath5 of disk galaxies exhibit significant `` lopsidedness '' ( rix & zaritsky 1995 ; kornreich , haynes , & lovelace 1998 ) which supports the early findings of baldwin , lynden - bell , & sancisi ( 1980 ) . as many as @xmath6 of spiral galaxies show departures from the expected symmetric two  horned global hi line profile ( richter & sancisi 1994 ; haynes _ et al .",
    "furthermore , hi maps of several galaxies , for example , ngc  3631 ( knapen 1997 ) , ngc  5474 ( rownd , dickey , & helou 1994 ) , and ngc  7217 ( buta _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) , have revealed offsets between the optical centers of light and their kinematic centers .",
    "two examples of kinematically lopsided galaxies have recently be discussed by swaters _",
    "other recent observations such as the _ hubble space telescope _ observations of the nucleus of m31 ( lauer _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) and the kitt peak 0.9 meter observations of ngc  1073 ( kornreich _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) indicate that even the optical center of light may be displaced from the center of the optical isophotes of the major part of the galaxy in a significant fraction of cases .",
    "the origin of the lopsideness in disk galaxies remains uncertain .",
    "et al . _ ( 1980 ) proposed a simple kinematic model in which different rings of the galaxy , assumed non - interacting , are initially shifted from their centered equilibrium positions .",
    "the shifted rings precess in the overall gravitational potential in a direction opposite to that of the mass motion . because the precession rate decreases in general with radial distance , an initial disturbance tends to `` wind up '' into a leading spiral arm in a time appreciably less than the hubble time .",
    "miller and smith ( 1988 , 1992 ) have made extensive computer simulation studies of the unstable eccentric motion of matter in the nuclei of galaxies which they suggest is pertinent to the off - center nuclei observed in a number of galaxies , for example , m31 , m33 , and m101 .",
    "understanding of the origin of the observed disk asymmetries is important because it provides clues to ongoing accretion of gas and the distribution of dark , unseen mass in the halo .",
    "schoenmakers , franx , and de zeeuw ( 1997 ) , interpret optical asymmetry as an indicator of asymmetry in the overall galactic potential , and therefore an indicator of the spatial distribution of the dark matter in a galaxy which may have a triaxial distribution . by analyzing the spiral components present in the surface brightness or distribution , the velocity gradient , and",
    "therefore , the shape of the gravitational potential , may be uncovered .",
    "jog ( 1997 ) has studied of the orbits of stars and gas in a lopsided potential , and shows that lopsided potentials arising from disks alone are not self - consistent ; rather , a stationary lopsided disk may be responding to asymmetries in the halo .",
    "zaritsky and rix ( 1997 ) proposed that optical lopsidedness arises from tidal interactions and/or minor mergers .",
    "such mergers are often suggested as the most likely contributors to galaxy asymmetry , even when no interacting companions are evident .",
    "while galaxies such as ngc  5474 are well - known to be under the tidal influence of neighbors , the apparently long - lived kinematic offsets of other relatively isolated objects , and the common asymmetries in flocculent ( as opposed to tidally induced `` grand design '' ) spiral galaxies , are not explained by simple tidal interaction models , which produce only transient asymmetric features .",
    "a further possibility is that an optical disk may be in a quasi - stationary lopsided state in a symmetric potential , as discussed by syer and tremaine ( 1996 ) . in this model ,",
    "gaseous and stellar matter swirl about the minimum of the halo potential in a state not fully relaxed .",
    "the result is a lopsided flow within a symmetric mass distribution .",
    "numerical simulations of this situation have been done by levine and sparke ( 1998 ) using a gravitational @xmath7body tree - code method ( see barnes & hut 1989 ) for disk galaxies shifted from the center of the main halo potential .",
    "the results are suggestive of lopsidedness with large lifetimes .",
    "an @xmath7body simulation study of a rotating spheroidal stellar system including the dynamics of a massive central object by taga and iye ( 1998a ) indicates that the central object goes into a long lasting oscillation similar to those found earlier by miller and smith ( 1988 , 1992 ) and which may explain asymmetric structures observed in m31 and ngc 4486b . a linear stability analysis of a self - gravitating fluid disk including a massive central object also by taga and iye ( 1998b ) indicates a linear instability ( taga & iye 1998b ) .",
