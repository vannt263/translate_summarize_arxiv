    "interest in the applications of networks to technological , biological , and social systems has grown significantly in recent years @xcite .",
    "one property of networks that has received much attention is the degree distribution , which characterizes the number of edges that connect a given node .",
    "many networks show a power - law form of the degree distribution , while other networks may have an exponential or truncated power - law distribution .",
    "however , there is a further property of networks that is not completely captured by the degree distribution alone : it is found that most networks have a high degree of clustering , with nodes tending to share many common connections .",
    "a number of ways have been developed to characterize such correlations .",
    "one standard approach was formulated by newman @xcite , who introduced what is now called the newman factor @xmath0 .",
    "this number is essentially the pearson correlation coefficient of degrees from connected vertices in a network and is fully defined by two  point correlations in a network .",
    "the newman factor is normalized to lie in the interval @xmath1 , and is defined so that positive ( negative ) values indicate that vertices with the same ( different ) degree tend to be connected , which indicate assortative ( disassortative ) mixing .",
    "a newman factor of 0 means no correlations are present .",
    "most networks have a non - trivial newman factor : biological networks tend to show negative @xmath0 values , technological networks display values close to zero , while social networks tend to have rather large positive values @xcite .",
    "another , related measure of correlations that is commonly used is the average nearest neighbour degree ( annd ) @xmath2 , which is a function in principle of the degree @xmath3 @xcite . for uncorrelated networks ,",
    "the annd is independent of @xmath3 , and thus an explicit @xmath3 dependence indicates the presence of degree correlations .",
    "a @xmath2 that is an increasing function of @xmath3 shows assortative mixing , while a decreasing function of @xmath3 indicates disassortative mixing .",
    "a third commonly used measure of correlations are clustering coefficients @xcite , which can be related to these other measures under certain assumptions @xcite .",
    "however , some of these measures may not completely capture all correlations that may be present in a network .",
    "for example , the pearson correlation coefficient by definition only explores linear relationships between two variables @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we develop a formalism that in principle can be used to measure higher  order non  linear correlations .",
    "we do this by examining an expansion of @xmath4 , the joint probability that an edge chosen at random connects vertices of degree @xmath3 and @xmath5 . in section [ expansion ] we develop this expansion , through which we can define generalizations of the newman @xmath0 factor and the annd @xmath2 which are sensitive to non  linear correlations .",
    "the expansion developed in this section involves certain input coefficients ; in section [ sannd ] we show how to relate this expansion to one involving the specification of certain generalized annd functions . in section [ clustering ]",
    "we use the results of ref.@xcite to show how these arise in defining clustering coefficients . in section [ examples ]",
    "we illustrate the use and effects of these generalizations in some simple examples .",
    "section [ conclusions ] contains some brief conclusions .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the probability of finding a node of degree @xmath3 , @xmath7 the conditional probability that a vertex of degree @xmath3 is connected to a vertex of degree @xmath5 , and @xmath8 be the joint probability that a randomly chosen edge connects vertices of degree @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",

    "we find a systematic expansion is possible , and will involve expansion coefficients @xmath78 . having specified these coefficients up to a certain order , the usual measures of nearest  neighbour degree correlations  the average nearest neighbour degree annd , pearson  inspired correlation coefficients , and various clustering coefficients  can be calculated . in the present case ,",
    "since non  linear terms in the expansion would in principle appear , appropriate generalizations of these measures of degree correlations were introduced .",
    "one possible use for the type of expansion discussed in this paper might be as a means to estimate qualitatively the effect of nearest  neighbour degree correlations in models describing the evolution of states of nodes on specific networks  for example , the propagation of disease on the network . this can be formulated in terms of the equations governing the evolution of probabilities .. this can come by formulating the equations governing the evolution in terms of probabilities . to see this in a general sense ,",
    "let @xmath195 be the probability that a node of degree @xmath3 is in a state @xmath69 at time @xmath62 .",
    "a differential equation describing the time evolution of @xmath195 might then contain terms such as @xmath196 which would describe how the transition @xmath197 in the system , parameterized by a rate @xmath198 , affects the probability @xmath195 .",
    "nearest  neighbour degree correlations could be incorporated into this model by consideration of the interaction term @xcite @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the probability that a neighbour of the node , chosen randomly from amongst its @xmath3 neighbours , is in a state @xmath70 .",
    "thus , specifying a conditional probability function @xmath7 that differs from the uncorrelated case @xmath201 would allow one to see the effects of different types of degree correlations in this model .    if one is to use the expansion of @xmath102 of eq .",
    "( [ qu ] ) in specifying a conditional probability @xmath7 containing correlations , one must decide on the values of the expansion parameters @xmath78 to use , and at what point does one know that enough terms have been kept .",
    "a mild constraint on the expansion is that , being a perturbative expansion , the corrections about the unperturbed case should be small , and that inclusion of higher  order effects should not affect significantly the results of the presumably more important lower  order terms . an equivalent statement of this is that , for a given set of parameters , changing them slightly would not change the overall qualitative picture .",
    "it may be possible , by examining classes of real networks , to be able to say something about the relative magnitude of the various @xmath78 coefficients .",
    "however , if one wanted just a qualitative estimate of the relative effects of such degree correlations in the model under consideration , then one could consider a `` small '' number of terms in this expansion with `` small '' values of the @xmath78 parameters , where `` small '' in this context is defined through the constraint that the effects do not significantly alter the uncorrelated case .",
    "the examples of section [ examples ] show that a reasonable set of parameters can be chosen which incorporate various types of degree correlations .",
    "such an approach would not allow one to say anything quantitative about a real network , but it would allow one to decide , with some degree of confidence , whether or not inclusion of degree correlations in the model might lead to significant effects , and thus would be worthy of further , more detailed , study .",
