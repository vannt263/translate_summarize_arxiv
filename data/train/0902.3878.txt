    "the theoretical study of anomalously slow relaxation processes in time - dependent force fields constitutes a challenge of current research interest which is not free of ambiguity .",
    "it is known that there is no unique physical mechanism responsible for the occurrence of subdiffusion in condensed media @xcite .",
    "one possible mechanism , which will be addressed in this work , corresponds to disordered glassy - like media consisting of trapping domains where the traveling particle can dwell for a random time with divergent mean value @xcite .",
    "the successive residence times in traps are assumed to be mutually uncorrelated .",
    "diffusion is nevertheless a non - markovian ( semi - markovian ) process exhibiting long ( quasi - infinite ) time correlations in the particle positions with a weak ergodicity breaking @xcite .",
    "mathematically this physical picture can be described by a continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) model @xcite which in the continuous space limit leads to the fractional fokker - planck equation ( ffpe ) @xcite .",
    "this latter formulation is incomplete , as no non - markovian master equation can define the underlying non - markovian stochastic process @xcite .",
    "however , the ffpe is very useful and has a tightly associated , complete description with ( ordinary ) langevin equation in subordinated , random operational time @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the ctrw and ffpe to time - dependent forces is a highly non - trivial matter since the force changes in the real and not in the operational time @xcite .",
    "also , how a field varying in time affects the distribution of the residence times in the traps is not clear without specifying a concrete mechanism or some plausible model , especially when the mean residence time does not exist @xcite .",
    "the ffpe describing the dynamics in time - dependent force fields @xmath0 becomes ambiguous with a frequently ( ab)used , _ ad hoc _ version @xcite which lacks clear theoretical grounds @xcite . the correct version of the ffpe for time - dependent fields was first given in refs .",
    "@xcite : differently from the ffpe for a time - independent force , in the case of a time - dependent field the fractional derivative does not stand in front of the fokker - planck operator but after it .",
    "as we explain with this work in more detail , such a ffpe can be justified beyond the linear response approximation within a ctrw approach only for a special class of dichotomously fluctuating fields .",
    "the derivation of the ffpe for subdiffusion in such time - dependent fields is presented in sec .",
    "[ derivation ] .    in sec .",
    "[ results ] we apply the derived ffpe to study the influence of time - periodic rectangular fields on subdiffusive motion .",
    "analytical solutions of the ffpe are confirmed by stochastic monte carlo simulations of the underlying ctrw . in particular , we show with this work that the universal scaling relation between the biased anomalous diffusion and sub - current @xcite is not affected by the periodic driving .",
    "neither current nor diffusion are influenced asymptotically by the time - periodic field .",
    "this is in spite of the fact that unbiased subdiffusion of the studied kind can be strongly enhanced in the time - periodic field @xcite .",
    "since the ffpe does not define the underlying stochastic non - markovian process , its generalization to include the influence of a time - dependent field should start from the underlying ctrw @xcite .",

    "@xcite , an external field directed along @xmath21 would not affect the motion in the orthogonal direction(s ) .",
    "however , it is not correct to think that the rtd in the trap will not be influenced by the field acting in the direction of @xmath21 , as it will change the rates ( let us assume this simplest , tractable model ) for moving left or right when escaping from the trap .",
    "therefore , the rtd will generally be affected , see e.g. ref .",
    "obviously , the only situation when the rtd in the trap will not be changed is when the sum of the rates to escape from the trap , either left or right , is constant . in that case , only the probabilities @xmath22 acquire additional time - dependence and not the rtds @xmath23 .",

    "<S> the fractional fokker - planck equation for subdiffusion in time - dependent force fields is derived from the underlying continuous time random walk . </S>",
    "<S> its limitations are discussed and it is then applied to the study of subdiffusion under the influence of a time - periodic rectangular force . as a main result , we show that such a force does not affect the universal scaling relation between the anomalous current and diffusion when applied to the biased dynamics : in the long time limit subdiffusion current and anomalous diffusion are immune to the driving . </S>",
    "<S> this is in sharp contrast with the unbiased case when the subdiffusion coefficient can be strongly enhanced , i.e. a zero - frequency response to a periodic driving is present . </S>"
