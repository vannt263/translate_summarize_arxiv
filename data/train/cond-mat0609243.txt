    "undoped graphene has no free electrons , so an infinite sample can not conduct electricity .",
    "a finite sample can conduct , because electrons injected at one end can be transmitted a distance @xmath5 to the other end via so - called evanescent modes .",
    "these are modes that decay @xmath6 with a penetration depth @xmath7 bounded from above by the width @xmath1 of the sample . for a wide and narrow sample ( @xmath8 ) , there are many evanescent modes that contribute appreciably to the conductance . because the transmission of an electron via an evanescent mode is a stochastic event , the current fluctuates in time  even in the absence of any scattering by impurities or lattice defects .",
    "tworzydo et al.@xcite found that the shot noise produced by the evanescent modes in an undoped carbon monolayer ( of length @xmath5 @xmath9 width @xmath1 ) is _ pseudo - diffusive _ : the fano factor @xmath10 ( ratio of noise power @xmath11 and time - averaged current @xmath12 ) has the same value @xmath13 as in a diffusive metal ( while @xmath14 for independent current pulses).@xcite    a carbon bilayer has an additional length scale , not present in the monolayer of ref .  , namely the interlayer coupling length @xmath4 .",
    "it is an order of magnitude larger than the interatomic distance @xmath15 within the layer:@xcite @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , respectively the carrier velocity , interatomic distance , and nearest - neigbour hopping energy within a single layer , and @xmath20 the nearest - neighbour hopping energy between two layers@xcite ) . since @xmath5 is typically large compared to @xmath4 ,",

    "the fano factor , therefore , still equals @xmath2 when the fermi level coincides with the dirac point ( at which conduction and valence bands touch ) .",
    "however , the interval @xmath21 in fermi energy around the dirac point where this pseudo - diffusive result holds is much narrower , by a factor @xmath3 , in a bilayer than it is in a monolayer .    our results for the mean current @xmath12 , and hence for the conductance in a ballistic system",

    "we have taken the same electrostatic potential @xmath34 in both layers .",

    "the intersection point moves closer and closer to @xmath117 as the sample length @xmath5 is increased , but there is no clear plateau around the intersection point .",
    "moreover , as shown in appendix b , the intersection point does not correspond to a minimum or maximum as a function of the fermi energy , so that these values would be difficult to extract from a measurement .",
    "we do believe that the results of ref .",
    "describe the asymptotic limit @xmath118 at @xmath119 .",
    "however , because in this limit the width @xmath120 of the resonance at the dirac point vanishes , it seems unobservable .",
    "in conclusion , we have demonstrated that the pseudo - diffusive transport at the dirac point , discovered in ref .   for a carbon monolayer , holds in a bilayer as well .",
    "all moments of the current fluctuations have the same relation to the mean current as in a diffusive metal .",
    "in particular , the fano factor has the @xmath2 value characteristic of diffusive transport , even though the bilayer is assumed to be free of impurities or lattice defects .",
    "although we found that an undoped bilayer transmits as two undoped monolayers in parallel , the two systems behave very different away from charge neutrality .",
    "the resonance of evanescent modes around the dirac point of zero fermi energy has width @xmath121 in a bilayer , which is smaller than the width in a monolayer by the ratio of the interlayer coupling length @xmath4 and the separation @xmath5 of the metal contacts .    since @xmath122",
