    "since the 1990 s , many authors have successfully applied the so - called monotone lhpital s rules to establish many new and useful inequalities .    in this article",
    "we make use of the connection of these rules to some well - known properties of concave / convex functions ( via a change of variable ) to extend the usability of the rules . we show how",
    "the rules can be formulated under no differentiability requirements , and how to characterize all possible situations , which are normally not covered by the conventional form of the rules .",
    "these include situations in which the functions involved have non - zero initial values and when the derived functions are not necessarily monotone .",
    "this perspective is not new ; it can be dated back to hardy , littlewood and plya ( abbreviated as hlp ) .",
    "the concepts of non - decreasing , increasing ( we use this term in the sense of what some authors prefer to call `` strictly increasing '' ) , non - increasing , and decreasing functions are defined as usual .",
    "the term `` monotone '' can refer to any one of these senses . for convenience",
    ", we use the symbols @xmath0 and @xmath1 to denote increasing and decreasing , respectively .",
    "the rules have appeared in various formulations .",
    "let us start with the most popularly known form .",
    "let @xmath2 .",
    "a dual form assumes @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the same conclusion holds .",
    "note that even though the rule allows @xmath6 , and that @xmath7 or @xmath8 need not be defined at @xmath9 , as far as the proof is concerned we may assume without loss of generality that @xmath9 is finite , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined and continuous up to @xmath9 , because we can first study the functions in a smaller subinterval @xmath10\\subset(0,b ) $ ] and then let @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath7 and @xmath8 are assumed to be differentiable , we take @xmath13 and @xmath14 to mean the righthand derivative at @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 to mean the lefthand derivative at @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , we can take @xmath19 after a suitable translation .",
    "these simplifications will be assumed in the rest of the paper .",
    "some of the variations in other formulations are merely cosmetic .",
    "for example , if @xmath20 , then use @xmath21 instead , or if @xmath7 is not defined at @xmath22 , use the righthand limit @xmath23 , if it exists",
    ". we will not dwell further on these types .",
    "some other variations are attempts to weaken the differentiability requirement on @xmath7 and   @xmath8 .",
    "a different type concerns stronger formulations in which strict monotonicity can be deduced from non - strict hypothesis .",
    "we defer a discussion of such variations to section  2 . in the majority of concrete practical applications , however , the functions involved are fairly smooth , often infinitely differentiable and the stronger forms are seldom used .",
    "propositions 147 and 148 ( page 106 ) in the famous classic by hlp @xcite ( first edition 1934 ) read :    other than the phrases in red , proposition 148 is essentially the increasing part of the monotone rule , and proposition 147 is an application of the rule in the same spirit as in the more recent work . at first reading ,",
    "proposition 148 appears to be weaker than the modern rule because it requires the additional conditions that @xmath7 is + and @xmath0 , and @xmath24 is + .",
    "let us take a closer look at hlp s short and elegant proof which is reproduced below .",
    "[ hardy , littlewood , plya ] to prove this , observe that @xmath25 and consider the possible intersections of the curves @xmath26 , @xmath27 . at one of these intersections the first curve has a horizontal and the second a rising tangent , and therefore there can be at most one intersection .    if we take @xmath8 as the independent variable , write @xmath28 , and suppose , as in the last clause of the theorem , that @xmath29 or @xmath30 , then the theorem takes the form : _",
    "if @xmath30 and @xmath31 increases for @xmath32 , then @xmath33 increases for @xmath32 .",
    "_ this is a slight generalization of part of theorem 127 .    in the proof",
    ", the + @xmath34 property of @xmath8 is needed to guarantee that the denominators of the fractions @xmath35 and @xmath24 will not become 0 .",
    "the + @xmath34 property of @xmath7 and the positivity of @xmath24 , however , is not needed anywhere .",
    "once the extra conditions are disposed of , we see that the @xmath36 version of rule also holds , by considering @xmath37 instead of @xmath38 .",
    "hlp did not attribute the result to anyone .",
    "it could mean that it is one of their own , or it was widely known .",
    "we did not attempt to track it down further in earlier literature .    in one of the bourbaki books , @xcite ( 1958 ) , exercise 10 of chapter 1 ,  2 ( page 38 )",
    "is exactly hlp s proposition 148 , minus those extra conditions .",
    "it seems that in the intervening years , someone must have figured out that those are superfluous .",
    "neither a solution nor any attribution is given .",
    "mitrinovic @xcite quoted bourbaki s exercise as  3.9.49 .",
    "hlp s proposition , on the other hand , is broader than the modern rule .",
    "it says something about the general situation when neither @xmath39 nor @xmath40 is assumed . in section  3 , we will fully characterize all such situations .",
    "a classroom note by mott @xcite ( 1963 ) in the monthly presented a much weaker version of the monotone rule , in the integral formulation ( see section  2 ) .",
    "in the ( more or less ) equivalent differential formulation , the hypotheses require @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( which implies @xmath24 is @xmath34 ) .",
    "two follow - up papers by redheffer @xcite ( 1964 ) and boas @xcite ( 1965 ) contained alternative proofs and further comments .",
    "the authors were unaware of the earlier results .    then came the work of gromov @xcite , anderson , vamanamurthy , and vuorinen @xcite @xcite , pinelis @xcite , and many subsequent authors who have done a tremendous amount of good work to enrich the subject area .",
    "the readers should have no difficulty finding them by searching for `` monotone lhpital rule '' on the internet , and by referring to the references cited in the papers listed .",
    "analogous to the classical lhpital s rule for finding limits of indeterminant forms , one can also consider the situation when @xmath43 .",
    "results , examples and counterexamples in this regard are presented in anderson , et al .",
    "@xcite . in this article",
    ", we confine ourselves to the case when @xmath44 and @xmath45 are finite .",
    "if we let @xmath46 and @xmath47 , then the rule stated in section  1 becomes :    this integral formulation has two advantages .",
    "one is that now we do not have to separately assume that @xmath48 .",
    "second is that the rule , stated as it is , can be applied to functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 with discontinuities .",
    "for instance , @xmath51 and @xmath52 may be piecewise continuous , such as step functions , as long as their quotient is still monotone .",
    "in such cases , the differential form would have failed because the requirement that @xmath7 and @xmath8 be differentiable at every point is not satisfied .",
    "if one has proved the differential form of the rule previously based on this assumption , such as invoking the generalized cauchy mean value theorem , one has to seek a different proof .",
    "alternatively , one can use an approximation technique , as suggested by redheffer @xcite , to deduce the integral form from the differential form . choose a sequence of continuous functions",
    "@xmath53 that converge to @xmath52 in the uniform norm in the finite interval @xmath54 $ ] . next , choose another sequence of continuous functions @xmath55 that converge to @xmath56 , this time requiring that each @xmath55 preserves the same monotone property of the latter .",
    "this can be done , for instance , by using the well - known method of mollifiers of s. sobolev and k.o .",
    "friedrich in the theory of partial differential equations .",
    "since the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are now differentiable everywhere , the differential form of the rule implies that @xmath59 is monotone . letting @xmath60 gives the desired conclusion .",
    "there are other ways to relax the differentiability requirement in the differential formulation .",
    "for example , one can use one - sided dini derivatives instead of regular derivatives . in the next section",
    ", we will see how the rule can be formulated even without mentioning differentiability . as we have remarked before",
    ", such extensions may be of theoretical value , but they are often not needed for practical applications .    another direction of extension is to strengthen the conclusion of the rule .",
    "pinelis @xcite showed that if @xmath24 is @xmath34 , then @xmath61 is in fact strictly + ( with strict monotonicity following as a corollary ) .",
    "one can compare this with the regular and strong forms of the maximum principle in the theory of differential equations .",
    "the weaker form states that the global maximum must be attained at the boundary of the region in consideration , while the strong form maintains that at the boundary point where the global maximum is attained , the directional derivative along the outward normal must be strictly + .",
    "one is also able to deduce strict monotonicity in a certain sense from non - strict monotone assumptions .",
    "one such case will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in the particular case when @xmath62 , the increasing monotone rule reduces to :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ if @xmath39 and @xmath63 , so is @xmath64 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the slightly weaker ( since @xmath7 is required to be twice differentiable ) version , @xmath65 , is what hlp referred to as proposition 127 .",
    "both of these results are subsumed by the following well - known property of convex functions . @xmath66{5 in }",

    "width4pt depth1pt    but how do we make the quantum jump from the special case @xmath62 to the general case ?",
    "the trick of change of variable , just as hlp pointed out in their proof , is the key . by the way",

    "the inverse function @xmath95 is well - defined .",

    "we have then the following generalized monotone rule .    in practical applications , to check the convexity or concavity of @xmath97 ,",
    "we often resort to showing that @xmath98 is monotone . by the chain rule",

    "this new rule is more general than the popular one described on p.  1 , because it does not impose any differentiability on @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and it covers situations when @xmath20 .",
    "if we omit `` strictly '' in the hypotheses , we can not guarantee that @xmath35 is strictly monotone , as the degenerate example @xmath100 shows .",

    "we can show that @xmath64 is decreasing in @xmath121 $ ] as follows .",

    "if @xmath129 , then we can argue in a similar way as above that @xmath64 is @xmath34 in @xmath114 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "is there a practical way to delineate the two situations in the conclusion ? in the special case @xmath62 and @xmath38 is convex , it is easy to see that a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an interior @xmath112 is that in a left neighborhood of @xmath9 , the curve of @xmath7 lies below the chord joining @xmath76 and @xmath130 . in the general setting , this criteria can be expressed as @xmath131 one can also use limsup instead of liminf . for differentiable @xmath38 and @xmath94",

    "in the special case when @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath7 is convex , the corresponding problem is to investigate the @xmath34 and @xmath36 properties of @xmath141 , which is the slope of the line joining the point @xmath142 on the @xmath82-axis and the point @xmath143 on the graph of @xmath7 .",
