    "neutron stars ( ns ) provide us with opportunities to probe the properties of matter at extremely high densities , and have proven to be fantastic test bodies for theories involving general relativity . in a broader perspective ns provide access to the phase diagram of matter at extreme densities and temperatures , which is the basic for understanding very early universe and several other astro - physical phenomena .",
    "the observational quantities of primary astrophysical interest are the maximum mass and the typical radius of a ns .",
    "neuron stars are detected as pulsar+ns or pulsar+white - dwarf or x - ray binaries .",
    "recent observations of pulsars and x - ray binaries suggest that the maximum mass of a ns lies between @xmath0 @xcite , where @xmath1 is the solar mass .    to understand the observables of ns , various theoretical models",
    "have been developed and can be grouped into three broad categories @xcite : nonrelativistic potential models @xcite , relativistic field theoretical models @xcite and dirac - brueckner - hartree - fock models @xcite . in each of these models , the addition of hyperon @xcite or kaon or pion @xcite or quarks @xcite or their combinations , will soften the equation of state ( eos ) and hence lower the maximum mass of ns . in all of these models , coupling constants and unknown meson masses",
    "are treated as effective parameters adjusted to fit the empirical quantities ( saturation density @xmath2 , binding energy @xmath3 , compression modulus @xmath4 , effective nucleon mass @xmath5 and asymmetry energy @xmath6 ) at nuclear saturation .",
    "the compression modulus ( @xmath7 defines the curvature of the eos  at saturation density and its value will be reflected in the high density behaviour ( stiffness or softness ) of the eos .",
    "thus @xmath4 will have a direct bearing on the maximum mass .",
    "interestingly , the study of isoscalar giant resonances can reveal rich information about nuclear compressibility @xcite .",
    "the eos and hence the ns radius can directly be linked to the neutron skin thickness in heavy nuclei @xcite .",
    "these strong links between the ns structure and finite nuclear properties prove that the knowledge in these two areas complement each other .",
    "one among the very - well tested model in finite nuclei is the nonlinear @xmath8 model , widely mentioned as relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model @xcite .",
    "the rmf model constructed with idea of renormalizability , produces accurate results for spherical and deformed nuclei but it gives a very stiff eos for infinite nuclear matter .",
    "recently , inspired by effective field theory ( eft ) furnstahl , serot and tang @xcite abandoned the idea of renormalizability and extended the rmf theory , with the systematic inclusion of new interactions by adding new terms to the model lagrangian . this effective field theory motivated rmf ( e - rmf ) model calculations explained finite nuclei and nuclear matter with exactly same parameters and with significant accuracy in both the cases @xcite .",
    "this approach can be considered as a salient step towards a unified and accurate theory for finite nuclei as well as for infinite nuclear matter .",
    "extension of this model with the inclusion of the kaon ( @xmath9 ) is the central interest of present work .    in ns , @xmath9-condensation is one of the several possible transitions that could exist at high density . as the density of ns increases",
    ", the chemical potential of the negative electric charge ( @xmath10 ) also increases with the same rate of proton number density .",
    "simultaneously , the effective mass of an in - medium @xmath9 will decrease , due to the attractive interaction between @xmath9 and nuclear matter .",
    "therefore at a particular density ( when @xmath10 is greater than energy of @xmath9 ) , @xmath9 replaces electron as neutralizing agent in charge - neutral matter . after the demonstration of interaction of @xmath9 with the nuclear medium by kaplan and nelson @xcite , this topic acquired enormous interest . glendenning and schaffner - bielich @xcite , explained the interaction of @xmath9 by coupling them to meson fields using a minimal coupling",
    "this approach was followed by several other theoretical groups using rmf models @xcite and has been adopted in this work as well .    in the present work we investigate the condensation from non - kaonic to kaonic phase , with different lagrangians . in the presence of such a transition",
    ", we study the effect of higher order couplings on the eos and hence on the ns properties .",
    "this work differs from many previous works in the sense that all the parameters used in e - rmf model were fitted to reproduce the observables of finite nuclei .",
    "also , the e - rmf model is well tested throughout the nuclear chart by explaining several nuclear properties @xcite .",
    "we show in this paper that this model explains the recent observations of ns as well .    in the section following this introduction",
    ", we describe the lagrangian and field equations , both for non - kaonic and kaonic phases .",

    "the pure neutron matter data , though model dependent , also was found to favour a softer eos .",
    "one important observation highlighted in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that the softness in eos from g1 , g2 and fsugold is mainly due to the new couplings and not due to the difference in compressibility as usually perceived .",

    "nl1 ( @xmath4=212 ) and nl3 ( @xmath4=271.76 ) yield different compressibilities but their eos are more similar .",
    "the role of higher order couplings in softening the eos has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the case of fsugold .",
    "eos from fsugold is softer than that of g2 because of the large and positive @xmath23 value as well as the introduction of isoscalar - isovector coupling ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "henceforth we discuss the role of new parameters of extended rmf models on the onset and effect of kaon condensation in ns . among the different parameter sets considered here ( table [ nucleon ] )",
    "g2 and fsugold have a positive quartic scalar self - coupling ( @xmath23 ) , which is more meaningful than a negative one @xcite .",
    "for this reason we prefer the set g2 , when we have to choose between g1 and g2 .",

    "[ kaonen ] , it is evident that the onset of @xmath9-condensation is strongly modified by the strength of the kaon optical potential ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "calculations based on chiral models @xcite suggest that a value @xmath93 mev is more appropriate for ns . hence in most of the further discussions we choose @xmath93 mev and",

    "[ fieldsg2 ] along with the @xmath10 . the density at which @xmath9 starts to contribute can be read from the point where the @xmath10 shows a sharp kink ( @xmath96 0.6 @xmath56 ) .",
    "though the corresponding kinks in the fields are very subtle , any small change in the field results in a significant change in energy density and pressure .",
    "the presence of @xmath9 alters the proton - neutron ratio and hence the contribution from the @xmath95 field is enhanced .",
    "this is due to the fact that the processes like @xmath97 are more energetically favoured than processes like @xmath98 at higher densities where @xmath9 energy is decreasing and @xmath10 is increasing [ see fig .",

    "[ fieldsg2 ] we can also see that the @xmath9 has very less influence on the @xmath12 field .",

    "the appearance of @xmath9 at higher densities and its role in population ( number density ) of different particles are presented in fig .",
    "[ densityg2 ] .",
    "as soon as @xmath9-condensation sets in , the population of @xmath9 rapidly increases with density and hence allows the presence of more protons .",
    "interestingly , at very high densities the number of protons exceed that of the neutrons , which is not the case if @xmath9 were not present .",
    "this can be seen from the corresponding deviation from the non - kaonic matter trends .",
    "apart from the arguments given earlier , the reason for @xmath66-@xmath9 pairs being preferred to neutrons is quantitatively very well explained by glendenning and schaffner - bielich @xcite . however , the symmetry term in the energy obviously prefer a symmetric matter and hence hinders the protons to be populated much more than neutrons .",

    "this is due to the interplay between the terms with higher order couplings ( @xmath114 ) which can give negative contribution to pressure . between g1 and g2 , the sign of the coupling constants @xmath115 and",
    "@xmath26 differ . among these three couplings ,",
    "the term comprising @xmath26 is weaker . in the case of g1 , due to",
    "the change in sign of @xmath23 , the combined effect of @xmath22 and @xmath23 on pressure is negligible .",
    "hence in g1 , @xmath25 dominates at higher densities in reducing the pressure . in case of g2 ,",
    "the contribution from terms having @xmath23 and @xmath25 is negligible and @xmath22 dominates at higher densities in reducing the pressure .",
    "thus in g1 and g2 , @xmath25 ( quartic scalar - vector cross - interaction ) , and @xmath22 ( cubic scalar self - interaction ) respectively , rule the suppression of pressure at very high densities .",
    "@xmath25 being associated with the vector self - interaction is much stronger at high densities and hence will be more effective than @xmath22 in reducing the pressure .",
    "couplings defined by @xmath25 and @xmath22 are of different order and will naturally yield results of different curvature which leads to the varying difference in pressure between g1 and g2 . the difference in pressure from g2 and fsugold",
    "is well reduced in the presence of @xmath9 , even at higher energies .",
    "interestingly , g2 with @xmath9 yields same pressure as that of fsugold without @xmath9 and in a broad energy range these results cease to differ",
    ". however , the corresponding energy densities are very different ( not shown here ) and hence the resulting maximum mass ns have different central densities ( represented by solid circles in fig .  [ pd ] ) .",
    "the eos around the region of central density is more dominant in determining the properties of ns .",
    "this region is quite different for different parameters .",
    "also one can see that the central density increases with softer eos , and the presence of @xmath9 decreases the central density and pressure .",
    "the change in central density ( @xmath116 ) due to @xmath9 depends mostly on the following three quantities , viz .",
    ".   density at which @xmath9-condensation sets in ( @xmath117 ) with @xmath118 , 2 .   the magnitude of central density with @xmath119 , and 3 .",
    "the stiffness of eos at @xmath120 , with stiffer eos leading to larger @xmath116 .",
    "the interplay of the above quantities gives arise to varying @xmath116 for different parameters .",
    "for example , between g1 and g2 , quantities ( ii ) and ( iii ) dominate ( i ) , resulting in a larger @xmath116 in case of g2 .",
    "these effects should naturally be seen in the calculation of maximum mass and radius of ns .",
    "we can obtain mass - radius relation for ns by solving the well - known tolman ",
    "oppenheimer  volkoff ( tov ) equations @xcite .",
    "the results for mass - radius relation in ns are given in fig .",
    "[ mr ] where the calculations are done using different interactions , without and with the @xmath9 ( @xmath93 mev ) . the rmf models nl3 and nl1 suggest very large and massive ns . in these cases",
    "though the maximum mass is reduced considerably ( from @xmath121 2.8 m@xmath122 to @xmath121 2.4 m@xmath122 ) in the presence of kaons , these are overshooting the observational constraints for ns @xcite .",
    "though g1 and g2 are from the same e - rmf model with same terms in the lagrangian , their results for ns are quite different with g1 suggesting a larger and heavier ns . as explained earlier , g1 and g2 yield eos of different nature and have varying role of @xmath9 .",
    "the result for g2 and fsugold are the closest ones . very interestingly ,",
    "though their difference is larger when @xmath9 are not considered , the presence of @xmath9 brings these two results closer .",
    "this is the direct implication of the same feature we observed in the case pressure ( fig .",
    "the g2 interaction allows more @xmath9 to be present ( due to early onset of @xmath9-condensation ) and hence makes the eos more softer which eventually get closer to that of fsugold .",
    "the observed reduction of maximum mass due to kaons , in case of nl3 and fsugold is consistent with the values quoted in ref .",
    "overall , in the presence of @xmath9 , the mass decreases and the radius corresponding to maximum mass increases .",
    "all the observational constraints shown in fig .  [ mr ] favor the models with higher order couplings but most of these constrains cover a broad range which may not be precise enough to ascertain the presence of kaons .    in fig .",
    "[ mr_u ] , we show the dependence of ns mass - radius on @xmath87 with g2 parameter set .",
    "we can see clearly that the stronger @xmath87 increases the contribution of @xmath9 which results in softer eos which in turn yields a smaller and lighter ns .",
    "the typical hook shape of the mass - radius curve is maintained till @xmath123 mev and beyond that the curve takes a straight dip which is a characteristic of first order @xmath9-condensation .",
    "it is interesting to note that without @xmath9 , the maximum mass given by g2 ( @xmath124 )  is closer to the one suggested by demorest _",
    "( @xmath105 ) @xcite with a radius of 11.03 km .",
    "g1 with @xmath125 mev ( graph not shown here ) suggests a maximum mass of @xmath126 with a radius of 12.45 km .",
    "figure  [ dr ] shows the number density versus the radial distance from the center of ns , calculated with g2 and fsugold parameter sets , when the ns is having the maximum mass ( @xmath127 for fsugold , and @xmath128 for g2 with @xmath93 mev ) .",
    "the behaviour of number densities shown in fig .",
    "[ dr ] is directly reflecting the patterns shown for relative populations plotted against density in figs .",
    "[ densityg2 ] and [ density_g1 ] ( b ) .",
    "the difference between the radii of kaonic matter suggested by g2 and fsugold is almost one km .",
    "another striking difference in the composition of ns is the asymmetry of the core .",
    "g2 suggests a nearly symmetric matter at the core whereas fsugold indicates highly neutron - rich core .",
    "we have seen that this trend remains same even at higher values of @xmath87 ( not shown here ) .",
    "it will be interesting to see how the presence of hyperons affect the overall scenario @xcite .",
    "in the present work , we have studied the role of higher order couplings of extended rmf models on the onset and effect of kaon ( @xmath9 ) condensation in neutron stars ( ns ) .",
    "we have calculated the ns properties with the successful rmf parameters nl1 and",
    "nl3 , the e - rmf parameters g1 and g2 ( four additional couplings to rmf ) , and the fsugold parameters ( two additional couplings to rmf ) .    in extended rmf models , with most common values of kaon optical potential ( @xmath129 mev )",
    ", the transition from a non - kaonic phase to kaonic phase in ns has a character of second order which rules out the possibility of having a mixed phase of kaonic and non - kaonic matter .",
    "this is consistent with the observation in ref .",
    "@xcite where higher order interactions are included using the lowest order chiral lagrangian .",
    "the role of more general higher order operators was considered to be an open question and we have shown that they lead to a second order phase transition . this justifies the neglect of mixed phase in our calculations mostly done with @xmath93 mev @xcite .    apart from the usual dependence on @xmath87 reported elsewhere @xcite , the onset of kaon condensation in ns strongly depends on the parameters of lagrangian especially the higher order couplings .",
    "this is due to the strong variation in density dependence of the @xmath9 energy ( @xmath39 ) and electron chemical potential ( @xmath10 ) whose interplay determine the onset of @xmath9-condensation .",
    "density dependence of @xmath39 is similar to that of eos and @xmath10 varies in a way similar to symmetry energy .",
    "so , any change in the density dependence of eos or that of symmetry energy will affect the onset as well as the effect of @xmath9-condensation . without higher order couplings , nl1 and nl3 have stiffer eos than others which leads to a stiffer @xmath39 and hence a early onset of @xmath9-condensation .",
    "fsugold comprises an unique isoscalar - isovector mixing which leads to a softer symmetry energy and hence a delayed onset of @xmath9-condensation .",
    "the central density of ns increases with softer eos , and the presence of @xmath9 decreases the central density and pressure .",
    "the change in central density due to the presence of @xmath9 is different for different parameters due to the interplay between ( i ) the density defining onset of @xmath9-condensation , ( ii ) the central density ( @xmath120 ) itself , and ( iii ) the stiffness of eos at @xmath120 . due to this ,",
    "the impact of @xmath9 is more pronounced in g2 than in g1 and is weakest in fsugold .",
    "all these effects are strongly reflected in the calculation of mass - radius relation of ns .",
    "the ns suggested by models without higher order couplings ( nl3 and nl1 ) contradict the observational constraints @xcite even with the inclusion of @xmath130 .",
    "the higher order couplings play a dominant role ( than kaons ) in bringing the mass and radius of ns within observed limits .",
    "different parameter sets lead to different concentration of kaons ( which is known to affect the population of protons @xcite ) in ns , and hence lead to different asymmetries in the core of ns .",
    "we have shown that g1 and g2 suggest a symmetric core whereas fsugold suggests a neutron rich core due to lesser amount of @xmath9 caused by an unique coupling which softens the symmetry energy .",
    "we conclude that the extended rmf models , which are quite successful in explaining several properties of finite nuclei , suggest a strong influence of higher order couplings and kaons in ns whose properties are within the present observational constraints @xcite ."
