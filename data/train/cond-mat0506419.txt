    "the study of ultracold quantum gases loaded on optical lattices has become a very active area of experimental and theoretical reseach in recent years . optical lattices",
    "enable enhancing interactions between atoms in weakly interacting bose - einstein condensates ( bec s ) and reducing the effective dimensionality of the system .",
    "they allow the experimental realization of strongly correlated bosons , well described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , with the consequent observation of the superfluid  mott - insulator transition @xcite .",
    "in addition , optical lattices have been used to obtain one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems @xcite and to examine the superfluid  mott - insulator transition in 1d @xcite .",
    "due to the strong effects of quantum fluctuations and the possibility of obtaining exact theoretical results , 1d systems are a very attractive laboratory for both experiments and theory .",
    "theoretically , it was shown by olshanii that in 1d in regimes of large scattering length , low densities , and low temperatures bosons behave as a gas of impenetrable particles known as hard - core bosons ( hcb s ) @xcite .",
    "such a 1d gas ( also recently called a tonks - girardeau gas ) was introduced by girardeau , who established an exact mapping between these strongly correlated bosons and noninteracting spinless fermions @xcite . since",
    "then 1d hcb s have been extensively studied by different techniques in both homogeneous @xcite and harmonically trapped @xcite systems .",
    "the experimental realization of 1d hcb s followed after more than 40 years of the theoretical introduction of the model @xcite , with @xcite and without @xcite an additional lattice along the 1d axis .",
    "the additional 1d lattice @xcite facilitates the achievement of the hcb regime with respect to the continuum case .",
    "it allows experimentalists to change the effective mass of the particles and , consequently , the ratio between interaction and kinetic energies @xcite . although at very low densities ( when interparticle distances are much larger than the lattice spacing ) hcb s on a lattice are equivalent to hcb s in continuous space , this is not the case for arbitrary fillings @xcite . on 1d lattices",
    "the hcb hamiltonian can be mapped onto the 1d xy model of lieb , schulz , and mattis @xcite . for periodic systems",
    "this model has been also studied extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "more recently , renewed interest has arisen on the properties of hcb s when additional confining potentials are introduced , as the case relevant to experiments @xcite .",
    "remarkably , even in trapped inhomogeneous systems power - law behavior known from the periodic case is present @xcite .",
    "the one - particle density matrix exhibits a universal power - law decay with exponent @xmath0 independent of the power of the confining potential @xcite .",
    "these quasi - long - range one - particle correlations generate quasicondensates with occupations scaling proportional to @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 the number of hcb s in the system ) @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium dynamics of hcb s on 1d lattices has also been shown to display very interesting features .",
    "quasicondensates of hcb s emerge at finite momentum when the system starts its free evolution from a pure mott - insulating ( fock ) state @xcite . in adition , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that in 1d when there is no mott insulator in the trap , the momentum distribution of expanding hcb s rapidly approaches that of noninteracting fermions @xcite .    in this work we present an exact study of the finite - temperature properties of hcb s confined on 1d optical lattices .",
    "following the spirit of refs .",
    "@xcite , we develop an exact numerical approach based on the jordan - wigner transformation , which maps hcb s on a lattice onto noninteracting spinless fermions .",
    "we will focus on the effect of temperature on the off - diagonal behavior of one - particle correlations and related quantities like the momentum distribution function @xmath3 and the natural orbital occupations .",
