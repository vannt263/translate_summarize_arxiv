    "blazars , including both bl lac objects and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) , represent the most powerful and highly variable class of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , with flat radio spectra , core - dominated radio morphology and radiation dominated by a relativistic jet oriented close to our line of sight ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "blazar jets can be strongly beamed depending on the relativistic doppler factor of the source .",
    "the relativistic jet of a blazar , at first approximation , can be defined by just two intrinsic parameters - the lorentz factor @xmath0 and the viewing angle @xmath1 .",
    "studying the radio jets of these sources is crucial to understand the kinematics of black holes and the laws of physics under extreme conditions .",
    "specially , having information on the fundamental and intrinsic properties of the relativistic jets , like lorentz factors and viewing angles , will help to constrain the physics of jet launching region , shed light in the formation , collimation , acceleration , and propagation of the jets , kinematically characterize the sources and estimate the underlying intrinsic physical properties of the sources , like their luminosity function ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . but owing to difficulties involved in measuring the intrinsic luminosity of the blazar jet , not much is known regarding these intrinsic parameters of blazars , neither individually nor as a population . in this paper , we present a novel method to obtain the distribution of these parameters for a population of blazars .    the most common way to calculate the blazar lorentz factor is by observing the apparent speed of the jet and estimating the doppler beaming factor .",
    "the apparent speed of the jets can be found directly by using very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) observations ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) . estimating the doppler beaming factor is more complicated and @xcite",
    "has compared the different methods currently used to estimate it and have found that a typical radio - loud quasar has a lorentz factor @xmath3 and a viewing angle @xmath4 , while a typical bl lac object has a lorentz factor @xmath5 and a viewing angle @xmath6 .",
    "doppler beaming factors can be estimated by calculating the decline of flux with time of a jet component and comparing it to the measured size of the vlbi component ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) ; by combining x - ray observations with radio fluxes at turnover frequencies ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) or by observing the brightness temperature of the source and comparing it to the equipartition temperature ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "but all these methods have their own assumptions and limitations .",
    "using the decline of flux of a jet with time to find doppler factor needs the assumption that the variability timescale of a resolved jet component is determined by the light travel time across the component , rather than loss processes and relies upon the observational determination of angular sizes of the component and the variability timescale @xcite .",
    "accurate measurements of doppler factors by combining x - ray observations with radio fluxes require simultaneous x - ray and radio data taken at the turnover frequency , without which large errors are induced ; while on the other hand using the brightness temperature method to obtain doppler factors is advantageous as it needs single - epoch radio observations , but the values again need to be obtained at the turnover frequency @xcite .",
    "these limitations are difficult to overcome , if the doppler boosting factor of a blazar is being estimated on a source - by - source basis , but it is possible to explore the connection between observed and intrinsic properties for a complete sample of blazars and find a lorentz factor distribution for the blazars as a population .",
    "the distribution for lorentz factors has been explored by many studies ( eg . * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite used the spread around the quasar radio / optical correlation to constrain the jet lorentz factors between 3 and 10 .",
    "@xcite compared the luminosity functions of flat spectrum radio quasars with relativistic models and found very good agreement for a distribution of lorentz factors @xmath7 , distributed as @xmath8 .",
    "@xcite has used the caltech - jodrell bank sample of bright , flat - spectrum , radio core - dominated agns ( cj - f ) and found that their model predictions are consistent with the cj - f data for a parent lorentz factor distribution of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    "we present a new , independent method to estimate blazar lorentz factor and viewing angle distributions by using the optical fundamental plane of black hole activity .",
    "the fundamental plane ( fp ) is a relation connecting hard state x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) and their supermassive analogs , suggesting that black holes regulate their output similarly across the entire mass scale @xcite .",
    "observationally , it is a plane stretched out by black holes over the entire mass range , in the 3d space provided by their x - ray luminosity , radio luminosity and black hole mass .",
    "it is given by the relation @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the core radio luminosity at 5 ghz , @xmath13 is the 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity and @xmath14 is the central black hole mass .",
    "these scalings can be well explained by the theory of synchrotron emitting compact relativistic jets and radiatively inefficient accretion flows @xcite .",
    "depending on the agn sample , the regression methods used to derive the fp coefficients can result in a significant scatter around the correlation , from @xmath15 0.38 - 0.65 dex @xcite , specially if one includes high - state objects , which most likely have additional emission components and hence can introduce a higher uncertainty .",
    "the fp has been re - established in the optical band , using the forbidden [ oiii ] emission line luminosity as an indirect tracer of accretion rate instead of x - ray luminosity @xcite . the optical fp is a very useful tool to study the intrinsic properties of blazars as the [ oiii ] emission line luminosity is direction - independent and is not affected by relativistic boosting , while both radio and x - ray luminosities can have significant contribution from the relativistic jet and hence have beaming effects .",
    "moreover , blazar sources , specially the low - frequency peaked bl lacs can have the synchrotron cut - off of the jet spectrum below the x - ray band .",
    "for such sources , the observed x - ray luminosity would be dominated by synchrotron self - compton emission and hence the [ oiii ] line luminosity is a much better proxy of the accretion rate .    with the optical fp relation , we can use the black hole mass and the [ oiii ] line luminosity to estimate radio luminosity , i.e. the intrinsic power of the jet .",
    "this plane relation is given as @xmath16 using supermassive black holes ( smbh ) only , while including the x - ray binaries in the analysis to reproduce the fundamental plane in x - rays has resulted in the relation @xmath17 .",
    "the radio and the oiii fluxes used in formulating this relation are directly observed , while the mass of the black holes are inferred from stellar velocity dispersions .",
    "we discuss the implication of using an inferred quantity to calculate the intrinsic radio luminosity in section 2.2 .",
    "for the plane obtained with the supermassive black holes , an intrinsic scatter of 0.35 dex was found , which was reduced to 0.2 dex after including the x - ray binaries in the plane .",
    "we use intrinsic radio luminosities obtained from the optical fundamental plane relation to estimate the boosting parameters of flat - spectrum radio sources from the vlba imaging and polarimetry survey ( vips ) , consisting of 1,127 sources with flat radio spectra taken from the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; @xcite ) . the black hole sample used for this study",
    "is described in section 2 . in section 3 , we discuss the flat - spectrum radio sources on the fundamental plane and use them in section 4 to shed light on the beaming properties of the population . finally in section 5 , we discuss our results and present the conclusions of this study .",
    "the blazars used in this study are taken from the vlba imaging and polarimetry survey ( vips ; @xcite ) consisting of 1,127 sources with flat radio spectra .",
    "the parent sample for this survey is the cosmic lens all - sky survey ( class ; @xcite ) - a vla survey of @xmath1512,100 flat - spectrum objects .",
    "class is the largest and best studied statistical sample of radio - loud gravitationally lensed systems with compact flat radio spectrum .",
    "the majority of the class sources are highly relativistically beamed .",
    "the parent population of the class sources consist of radio - loud agn , which are significantly brighter than the low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) used to construct the optical fp , as demonstrated by their higher radio and [ oiii ] line luminosities ( see fig [ fig : fp ] ) .",
    "they will then consist of fr i / ii radio galaxies and radio - loud quasars , which have been shown to follow the x - ray fundamental plane of black hole activity if one takes beaming into account ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "vips has selected all class sources on the survey area of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , with an upper declination limit of @xmath18 and a lower declination limit of @xmath19 , having flux densities greater than 85 mjy at 8.5 ghz , yielding a complete sample of 1,127 sources . of these , 141 have already been observed at 5 ghz with the vlba as part of the caltech - jordell bank flat spectrum survey ( cjf ; @xcite ) , 8 have been observed at 15 ghz as part of the monitoring of jets in agn with vlba experiments project ( mojave ; @xcite ) , and 20 were observed for the vips pilot program at 5 and 15 ghz @xcite .",
    "the remaining 958 sources were observed with the vlba .    for this study , we take only those sources for which we have available radio luminosity at 8.5 ghz ( from class survey taken with vla at configuration a ) , black hole mass and [ oiii ] emission line luminosity at 5007(from the catalog of quasar properties from sdss dr7 , @xcite ) .",
    "the sources in this sample are dominated by fsrqs and bl lacs .",
    "we would like to point out that the current method requires [ oiii ] line luminosities as tracer of accretion rate , and hence it does not work for extreme featureless bl lacs .",
    "the optical fp works for both low and high excitation sources ( llagn and seyferts ) .",
    "hence the fsrqs are expected to follow the plane relation ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "in order to compare these sources with the optical fp , the 8.5 ghz fluxes were converted to 5 ghz fluxes using a flat radio spectra . in order to properly constrain the parameters of the proposed correlation",
    ", we exclude the upper limits from our final data set . but this sample may contain few soft state sources that can introduce additional uncertainties in the intrinsic properties .",

    "black hole masses are used in the relationship instead of the directly observed stellar velocity dispersions . moreover ,",
    "a kendall tau partial correlation analysis was performed in @xcite with distance as the third variable , and the fp relation was found to be real even after taking into account the large range of inferred distance .",
    "the chi - square confidence map for the parameters of the fundamental plane was found to be an elongated ellipse , showing that the parameters are coupled @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in the directly measured quantities like radio and [ oiii ] fluxes and the inferred quantities like distances and black hole masses are properly taken into account using the merit function while deriving the fundamental plane parameters . restricting the final sample only to the galaxies which have available data in 15 ghz radio luminosity ,",

    "all radio - bright active galactic nuclei have relativistic jets emitting synchrotron radiation . due to relativistic effects , observed emission from these jets can be considerably brighter compared to the intrinsic luminosity .",

    "the exponent @xmath30 depends on various assumptions about jet structure , jet emission spectrum and the frequency at which the jet is observed . for a spectral index @xmath31 defined as @xmath32 ,",
    "the boosting index @xmath30 can be approximated to be @xmath33 or @xmath34 respectively in the case of a continuous jet or a jet with distinct blobs @xcite .",
    "blazars generally have flat spectra ( @xmath35 ) and hence we take @xmath36 for this study .",
    "the possible different choices of @xmath30 are discussed in section 4.3 .",
    "previously , relativistically beamed bl lac objects were either excluded from the fundamental plane studies as the jet emission is heavily boosted @xcite , or doppler boosting was corrected assuming an average doppler factor @xmath15 7 @xcite . in the latter case , it was seen that the x - ray / radio ratio is rather insensitive to the doppler factor and the main effect was just a shift in the position of the sources along the correlation - the bl lacs were pushed from the upper end of the correlation into the regime where fr i radio galaxies lie .",
    "this was theoretically expected as both x - ray and radio luminosities are subjected to relativistic beaming .",
    "studying the blazars with the optical fp can give us more insight as unlike the x - ray and radio luminosities , the [ oiii ] emission line luminosity is assumed to be direction - independent and hence not affected by relativistic boosting .",

    "the relation was then extrapolated to lower black hole masses and the stellar mass black hole were consistent with the plane found with only the smbhs .",
    "we now extrapolate the same relation to the higher black hole mass region and put the vips blazar data on the previous plane , without fitting them ( see fig [ fig : fp ] ) .",
    "the blazars were found to have much higher radio luminosity compared to what was expected by the fundamental plane , which can be explained by relativistic beaming and the vips flux density limit of 85 mjy at 8.5 ghz .",

    "these are the intrinsic radio luminosities of the sources , without the effect relativistic beaming .    , and are plotted in the logarithmic scale.,width=311 ]    the intrinsic radio luminosities of the blazar sample are theoretically boosted using monte carlo simulation for a given viewing angle and lorentz factor distribution .",
    "the resultant theoretically beamed radio luminosity distribution is then compared with the observed radio luminosity distribution obtained from the vips observations .",
    "the intrinsic scatter of the optical fp ( 0.35 dex ) is added in the simulation to include the errors of the plane in the simulated sample .",
    "the viewing angles were randomly chosen from an uniform distribution in cos @xmath1 for a @xmath1 range of @xmath37 to 30@xmath38 , assuming that the sources are randomly aligned with respect to the observer s line of sight .",
    "as explained in section 4.2 , the selection biases were later taken into account while simulating the blazars from the fundamental plane and the final @xmath1-distribution is found to be steeper at lower viewing angles .",

    "* etc . ) .",
    "the use of other possible lorentz factor distributions are discussed in section 4.3 .",
    "moreover , in order to match the sensitivity of the simulated sample with the observed one , we incorporate the selection effect of the vips sample ( radio flux - cut of 85 mjy at 8.5 ghz ) in the monte carlo simulation .",
    "once the theoretically simulated sample is constructed , we compare it with the vips observed blazar sample . as seen in fig [ fig : boo ] , the simulated sample occupies the same space as the vips observed sample .",

    ", we can reject the hypothesis that the distributions of the two samples are the same.,width=306 ]    the ks statistic values and the p - values obtained from the simulated sample can be used to constrain the lorentz factor distribution of the vips blazar sample .    as the first step , we fix the minimum lorentz factor ( @xmath43 ) of the vips sample , and compare the ks p - values for different combinations of maximum lorentz factor ( @xmath41 ) and the power law index of the @xmath0-distribution ( i.e. @xmath42 in @xmath9 ) . for higher ks statistics or smaller p - values , we can reject the hypothesis that the distributions of the theoretically simulated sample and the observed sample are the same .",
    "color - bar diagrams depicting the ks values for different combinations of @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be seen in fig [ fig : color ] . for the blue parts of the plot",
    "i.e. when the p - value is small ( @xmath44 0.15 ) , we can reject our null hypothesis .",
    "hence , we can constrain a very thin range of possible lorentz factor distributions , for which the theoretically simulated sample can match the vips observed ones .",
    "this gives a rough idea about the possible values of @xmath41 and the power - law exponent @xmath42 for a given @xmath43 .",
    "as evident from fig [ fig : color ] , for a fixed @xmath45 , the shape of the @xmath0 distribution shows a steep evolution for small @xmath41 values , but it gets almost constant for any choice of @xmath41 higher than 40 .",
    "previous observational studies of relativistic jet lorentz factors have reported @xmath41 values of 40 or more ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "for example , the mojave survey of compact , highly beamed radio - loud agns analyzed 127 jets and used the apparent velocities of the jet components to report a lorentz factor distribution in the parent population that range up to @xmath1550 @xcite .",
    "the maximum possible lorentz factor in our distribution needs to be more than what is observed .",
    "it is clear from fig [ fig : color ] that for any choice of @xmath41 higher than 40 , there is no considerable evolution in the value of @xmath42 .",
    "hence , to evaluate the lorentz factor distribution of the vips blazar sample in more detail , we can safely fix the @xmath41 value at 40 , and the resultant shape of the distribution can be considered to be true for other values of @xmath46 .",
    "then , for a given @xmath43 and @xmath41 , it is possible to constrain the shape of the lorentz factor distribution statistically by performing a ks test between the theoretically simulated sample from the optical fp and the observed vips sample .     distributions for a fixed @xmath0 range of 1 - 40 and a @xmath1 range of 0 - 30 , showing a best - fit value for @xmath47.,width=302 ]    with a fixed @xmath0 range of 1 - 40 and @xmath1 range of 0 - 30 , we use monte carlo simulation to create different theoretically boosted samples for various power - law exponents ( @xmath42 of @xmath9 ) .",
    "we compare all these theoretical samples with the vips observed sample , compute their ks values and find that the highest ks p - values are obtained for a power law index of -2.1 . in fig",
    "[ fig : gamdist ] , we show the ks values obtained for different power - law exponents . from the ks p - values",
    "obtained , we can reject the null hypothesis of the two samples being similar for all the @xmath42 values outside the range of @xmath15 - 1 to @xmath15 - 3 .",
    "we can statistically constrain the lorentz factor distribution for a @xmath0 range of 1 - 40 to be a power law @xmath2 .      the parent viewing angle ( @xmath1 ) distribution was taken as an uniform distribution ranging from @xmath37 to 30@xmath38 , properly weighed by the 3d spherical distribution function .    but as mentioned in section 3.2 , while boosting the simulated blazars from the fundamental plane , we put in the selection effect of the vips sample ( radio flux - cut of 85 mjy at 8.5 ghz ) to match the sensitivity of the simulated sample with the observed one .",
    "this ensures that only those @xmath1s are selected , for which the theoretical blazar sample from the optical fp can be boosted enough to clear the radio flux cut - off needed for the vips sample .    in fig",
    "[ fig : theta ] , we show the theta distribution obtained from simulations of various bootstrapped vips blazar sample . as evident from fig",
    "[ fig : theta ] , this condition on sensitivity results in the final @xmath1-distribution to be steepest at lower viewing angles , which flattens out as the viewing angle increases .",
    "hence , we conclude that most of the sources in a blazar population have a viewing angle smaller than @xmath48 , which agrees with previous studies ( eg .",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "it is important to examine if the derived distribution of lorentz factors depends on the input parameters used in the analysis . here",
    "we discuss how different choices of input parameters affect the agreement between the vips observed sample and the theoretical sample simulated from the optical fundamental plane .",
    "the range of possible lorentz factors of flat - spectrum sources is still uncertain . for our analysis ,",
    "we have used a @xmath0 range of 1 - 40 , though this range can easily be much larger .",
    "but as shown in the ks p - value plot of fig 5 , for a given @xmath43 , different choices of @xmath41 do not change the final result considerably .",
    "a detailed analysis done for a @xmath1 range of @xmath49 with a @xmath43 = 1 shows that the power - law exponent of @xmath0 distributions can be constrained as @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath41 values of 40 , 60 and 90 , respectively .",
    "so the details of the distribution does not change much with different @xmath41 values .",
    "also , having a @xmath43 value larger than 3 can be ruled out for our sample , as for no choice of @xmath41 , a ks p - value higher than 0.3 could be obtained for a @xmath43 value higher than 3 .",
    "we need to include blazar sources having lorentz factor values lower than 3 to properly constrain the lorentz factor distribution of the population using our method . hence , although blazars are considered to be highly relativistic sources , our analysis indicates that the possibility of having sources with @xmath0 values less than 3 , can not be ruled out for the given sample .",
    "this suggests that the sample we have used may not be completely pure blazars and may contain few sources which are flat spectrum radio sources that are not highly relativistically beamed .",
    "as seen in fig [ fig : theta ] , the only assumptions on the parent viewing angle distribution , that can change the boosting parameters considerably , is the choice of the @xmath53 value . in this study , we have taken @xmath53 to be @xmath37 . in fig",
    "[ fig : thegam ] , we constrain the power - law exponents of @xmath0 distributions for a fixed @xmath0 range of 1 - 40 , with @xmath53 values of @xmath37 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 to be @xmath47 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .    from the constrained power - law indices , we see that using a higher @xmath53 results in a lower value of the power - law index with a higher standard deviation .",
    "that is expected as standard models of relativistic jets predict that the opening angle of the jet should be inversely proportional to the lorentz factor ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "hence introducing a higher @xmath53 cut will effectively lower the @xmath41 value and suppress higher @xmath0 factors in the lorentz factor distribution .",
    "for example , @xmath53 of @xmath55 implies a @xmath58 , with a corresponding suppression of @xmath0 factors near the upper limit of the distribution , i.e. around @xmath5930 .",
    "vips , the parent sample of this study , is selected to consist of flat - spectrum objects with a spectral index @xmath60 -0.5 ( between 4.85 ghz and a lower frequency ) . theoretically , for a relativistically beamed source , the boosting index is @xmath33 for a continuous jet and @xmath34 for a jet with distinct blobs @xcite .",
    "as the fundamental plane is theoretically based on a continuous jet , for our analysis we use the case of @xmath33 , where @xmath31 is taken to be 0 for the blazars .",
    "we see that increasing the boosting index @xmath30 , results in a higher power - law index of the lorentz factor distribution , with a bigger uncertainty .",
    "the best - fit @xmath0-distribution using a continuous jet assumption with flat spectra ( @xmath61 0 ) was found to be @xmath2 for the @xmath0 range of 1 to 40 .",
    "this power - law index increases gradually from @xmath47 to @xmath62 , as the boosting index is increased from 2.0 ( continuous jet ) to 3.0 ( ballistic jet ) .",
    "previous studies have suggested and explored a power - law distribution for lorentz factors ( eg . * ? ? ?",
    "? * etc . ) . in this analysis , we have tried to constrain the power - law index for this distribution .",
    "we have also checked for other simple and possible forms of @xmath0 distributions like uniform and delta function distributions in the vips sample .    a two sample ks test analysis between the observed vips sample and a theoretical sample simulated from the fundamental plane using an uniform @xmath0 distribution of 1 - 40 gave a ks p - value of 0.25@xmath400.0001 , with the ks p - value decreasing even more with an increase in the @xmath0-range to values such as a ks p - value of @xmath63 for an uniform @xmath0 distribution of 1 - 60 .",
    "hence we can safely rule out the possibility of having a uniform gamma - distribution for the vips blazars .",
    "similarly , we also analyzed the agreement of the simulated and the observed sample for delta function distributions , i.e. single values of lorentz factors .",
    "it was seen that the lorentz factor delta distribution is required to center around a @xmath0 value more than 23 , for all the simulated blazars to clear the vips sample flux cut - off of 85 mjy at 8.5 ghz .",
    "and even these accepted lorentz factors result in very low ks p - values ( ks p - value of 0.0003 for a delta distribution of @xmath0=25 , with the p - value decreasing even more with an increase in the @xmath0 value , e.g. a ks p - value of @xmath64 for a @xmath0=30 ) .",
    "therefore , for the theoretically beamed sample to agree with the observed one , we can rule out a delta function distribution for the vips blazar lorentz factors . + hence",
    ", we can summarize that although the result can slightly change with some of the assumptions and input parameters like the boosting index value , the agreement between the theoretical and the observed sample is quite robust for a power law form of @xmath0-distribution with indices @xmath47 .",
    "in this paper , we present a new and independent method of calculating the lorentz factor distribution of a blazar population using the optical fundamental plane of black hole activity .",
    "we use the vips blazar sample and find the bulk lorentz factor distribution to be in the form of a power law given as @xmath2 , with a @xmath0 range of 1 to 40 .",
    "the optical fundamental plane is an efficient and insightful platform to study high - luminosity blazars , since , unlike the x - ray and radio luminosities , the [ oiii ] emission line luminosity of a blazar is direction - independent and hence not affected by relativistic boosting .",
    "another advantage of using the optical fp is that the blazars are high mass sources and hence the synchrotron cut - off of the jet spectrum can already be below the x - ray band , specially for the low - frequency - peaked bl lacs .",
    "thus , the observed x - ray luminosity will be dominated by synchrotron self - compton emission and hence can not be used as a proxy for the accretion rate .",
    "we take vlbi radio luminosities for the blazars observed in the vips survey and use the theoretical predictions from the optical fp to find a blazar lorentz factor distribution in the form of a power law .",
    "a power law form of the lorentz factor distribution has been explored earlier .",
    "@xcite had found a lorentz factor distribution in the form of @xmath8 , while @xcite had used a distribution of the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .    here , we constrain the blazar lorentz factor distribution along with its uncertainties , within the error range of the previous studies , to be a power law of the form @xmath2 in the @xmath0 range of 1 to 40 .",
    "this lorentz factor distribution of blazar population can be used in relativistic beaming models of blazar sources to properly constrain the physics of jet launching region and estimate their underlying intrinsic physical properties .",
    "the @xmath0-distribution presented in this paper has been obtained for the vips sample of blazars , which lie in the declination range of @xmath19-@xmath18 and have a flux density of 85 mjy or higher at 8.4 ghz .",
    "the finding should hold for the whole parent population of the class sample , which consists mainly of radio galaxies and flat spectrum radio quasars . with a bigger , statistically complete sample of blazars and further refinement of the optical fundamental plane , it will be possible to place tighter constrains on the shape of this distribution .",
