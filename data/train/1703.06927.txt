    "<S> the temperature @xmath11 at which @xmath12/@xmath13 deviates from its high - temperature linear behaviour is found to coincide with the temperature at which the resistivity @xmath14 deviates from its linear-@xmath13 dependence , which we take as the definition of the pseudogap temperature @xmath15  in agreement with the temperature at which the antinodal spectral gap detected in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) opens . </S>",
    "<S> we track @xmath15 as a function of doping and find that it decreases linearly vs @xmath16 in all four materials , having the same value in the three lsco - based cuprates , irrespective of their different crystal structures . at low @xmath16 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath17  is higher than the onset temperature of the various orders observed in underdoped cuprates , suggesting that these orders are secondary instabilities of the pseudogap phase . a linear extrapolation of @xmath17(@xmath16 ) to @xmath16=@xmath18 yields @xmath17(@xmath16@xmath19@xmath18)@xmath20@xmath21(0 ) , the nel temperature for the onset of antiferromagnetic order at @xmath16=@xmath18 , suggesting that there is a link between pseudogap and antiferromagnetism . with increasing @xmath16 , @xmath17(@xmath16 ) </S>",
    "<S> extrapolates linearly to zero at @xmath16@xmath20@xmath22 , the critical doping below which superconductivity emerges at high doping , suggesting that the conditions which favour pseudogap formation also favour pairing . </S>",
    "<S> we also use the nernst effect to investigate how far superconducting fluctuations extend above the critical temperature @xmath23 , as a function of doping , and find that a narrow fluctuation regime tracks @xmath23 , and not @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this confirms that the pseudogap phase is not a form of precursor superconductivity , and fluctuations in the phase of the superconducting order parameter are not what causes @xmath23 to fall on the underdoped side of the @xmath23 dome . </S>"
