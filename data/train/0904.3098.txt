    "are used as the tracer in most of the aforementioned experiments , it is critical to test for the homogeneity of the lrg population . in this paper",
    "we address two key questions : _ are bcgs different from other cluster galaxies ? are bcgs distinct from non - bcg , luminous , red galaxies in clusters and groups ? _    because of their brightness and uniformity in luminosity , the bcgs have long been regarded as an ideal standard candle ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , however , it was realized that various corrections [ such as dependences of the bcg luminosity on the cluster richness class @xcite and bautz - morgan type @xcite , and the effect of galactic cannibalism @xcite ] have to be applied before any cosmological implication from the bcg hubble diagram can be extracted .    the small dispersion in bcg luminosity ( e.g. , @xmath3 mag as determined by @xcite ) also stimulated the discussion on their origin ( * ? ? ?",

    "* to name a few ) : whether they are simply `` the brightest of the bright '' or a different population from other cluster galaxies all together .",
    "if the former hypothesis were true , the bcg luminosity distribution ( ld ) simply results from sampling of an universal ld of all cluster galaxies , and its small dispersion in magnitude reflects the steepness of the bright end of the universal ld . to test for such a `` statistical nature '' of the bcgs , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter tr ) devised a couple of statistics based on the mean and dispersion of the magnitude difference between the first- and second - ranked galaxies ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively ) , and the dispersion of the bcg magnitude ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the basic idea is that , if the bcgs are simply the statistical extreme of the cluster galaxy population , both @xmath6 and @xmath5 would be greater or comparable to @xmath4 . more specifically , under the assumptions that ( 1 ) the numbers of galaxies in non - overlapping magnitude intervals are independent random variables , and ( 2 ) the ld drops to zero rapidly at the extreme bright end , the following conditions need to be satisfied : @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see also @xcite ) .    using lrgs to identify dense environments such as groups and clusters",
    ", @xcite found a large magnitude gap ( @xmath9 mag ) between the first- and second - ranked galaxies in @xmath10 lrg - selected groups and clusters ( for which the majority of the lrgs are the bcgs ) .",
    "they concluded that the lrgs are inconsistent with being the statistical extreme of the universal galaxy ld , based on the tests proposed by tr .",
    "one fundamental issue faced by studies of very luminous galaxies , such bcgs , concerns with their luminosity . on the practical side , for nearby bcgs , measuring their total light is nontrivial . the majority of bcgs are giant elliptical or cd galaxies , whose surface brightness profile is typically flatter than that of normal elliptical galaxies , and can extend to tens or hundreds of kpc @xcite . to measure",
    "the `` total '' magnitude requires careful subtraction of the sky background . on the physical side ,",
    "the cd envelope may well extend into the intracluster space , and it is sometimes difficult to separate the luminosity of the bcgs from that of the intracluster stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this study we will use data from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , which is not deep enough to detect contributions from the intracluster stars .",
    "however , it is known that the current sdss pipeline has difficulty handling photometry of galaxies with large angular extents , and therefore may seriously underestimate the luminosity of bcgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in such cases , @xmath11 will be biased low .",
    "although corrections to bcg photometry ( if at all possible ) may decrease the value of @xmath12 , it may have the opposite effect on @xmath13 , making the interpretation of the tr tests more difficult ( see  [ sec : photo ] ) .    here",
    "we propose a new way to examine the statistical nature of the bcgs that is less dependent on a robust measurement of the bcg luminosity and @xmath11 , and apply it to a large sample of nearby clusters .",
    "our method is both conceptually and operationally very simple : with a sample of @xmath14 clusters , whose total galaxy luminosities are @xmath15 , where @xmath16 , one can combine all member galaxies to form a composite cluster . by drawing galaxies in random mock clusters",
    ", a galaxy can be picked more than once , or not selected at all . ] from the composite cluster to create @xmath14 mock clusters whose total luminosities are matched to the observed ones ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pool ] ) , the most luminous mock galaxies constitute the `` statistical '' bcg sample .",
    "one can then examine the distribution of the bcg luminosities ( @xmath17 ) for the observed and mock clusters .",
    "in particular , we look for deviations from the statistical expectation from the correlation between @xmath17 and @xmath18 . as cluster luminosity",
    "is correlated with its mass ( e.g. , @xcite ) , a comparison of the @xmath17@xmath18 correlation between the observed and mock clusters may provide some insights into possible cluster mass dependence ( if any ) in the bcg formation mechanism(s ) .",
    "the great virtue of the tr tests is that they only rely on a minimal set of assumptions concerning the nature of the ld , and is immune to any cluster - to - cluster variation . our proposed test , on the other hand ,",
    "although relying on the universality of the ld , is independent of the shape of the ld . in this sense",
    "the two approaches are highly complementary .    in  [ sec : data ]",
    "we describe our cluster sample and the galaxy data .",
    "we show the results of our tests in  [ sec : thetest ] , and present a comparison with the tr tests in  [ sec : tr ] .",
    "we apply our test to the second brightest cluster galaxies ( hereafter g2s ) in  [ sec : g2 ] .",
    "extensive tests have been carried out in order to show the robustness of our results (  [ sec : disc ] ) .",
    "we conclude by discussing the implications of our finding on the bcg formation scenarios and lrg - based bao surveys in  [ sec : disc_summary ] .    throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a flat @xmath19cdm cosmological model where @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "our clusters are drawn from an updated version of the c4 cluster catalog @xcite , which uses data from the fifth data release of the sdss @xcite . of the 2037 clusters in the sample ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to 494 that lie within the redshift range @xmath22 , with velocity dispersion @xmath23 km / s , and contain at least 2 luminous galaxies ( see below ) .",
    "while the lower limit in redshift helps to alleviate problems in photometric measurements of bright galaxies with large angular extents in sdss , the upper limit is chosen to ensure that nearly all galaxies with @xmath24 have redshifts measured by sdss ( i.e. , extinction - corrected petrosian magnitude @xmath25 , among other selection criteria ; @xcite ) .",
    "note that the characteristic magnitude for cluster red galaxies is @xmath26 ( see table  [ tab : fits ] below ) , based on our cluster sample .",
    "in addition , as we will combine galaxies from all clusters to form a composite cluster , the small redshift range chosen prevents any redshift evolution within our cluster galaxy sample .",
    "our first task is to assign cluster membership to galaxies in the sdss _",
    "main _ sample . for every cluster ,",
    "we include only _ red _ galaxies with redshift @xmath27 , with @xmath28-band absolute petrosian magnitude @xmath29 , and are projected within @xmath30 mpc of the cluster center ( defined as the peak of bright galaxy density distribution ; @xcite ) .",
    "here @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the cluster redshift and speed of light , respectively .",
    "a galaxy is considered red if the model color @xmath33 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to calculate the absolute magnitudes , we use the @xmath34-correction based on the nyu value - added galaxy catalog @xcite .",
    "in addition , a correction is made to convert the petrosian magnitudes into `` total '' magnitudes based on the surface brightness profile of the galaxies , following @xcite .    on average , about @xmath35 of galaxies in the sdss main sample have fibers assigned to them @xcite .",
    "this fraction becomes smaller in crowded fields , such as the clusters ( see @xcite and below ) , due to the size of the fiber plugs .",
    "it is therefore critical to correct for such an incompleteness when trying to include all cluster galaxies using the sdss main sample . for every cluster",
    "we first calculate the mean @xmath36 and @xmath37 colors @xmath38 and @xmath39 of the spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies , then assume the galaxies that ( 1 ) satisfy the above selection criteria ( @xmath33 , @xmath40 , projected distance @xmath41 mpc ) , ( 2 ) were targeted for spectroscopy but were not assigned a fiber , and ( 3 ) have @xmath42 and @xmath43 as probable cluster members ( hereafter referred to as the _ photometric members _ ) .",
    "we treat these galaxies exactly the same way as those with spectroscopic redshift measurements , and derive the absolute magnitudes by assuming they are at the cluster redshift .",
    "combining the lists of the spectroscopic and photometric members , we record the absolute magnitudes of the galaxies for each cluster .",
    "the 5980 galaxies with @xmath29 from all 494 clusters form our composite cluster , or a `` galaxy pool '' that by definition has the statistical galaxy ld ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) . among these galaxies ,",
    "871 are photometric members ( including 97 bcgs ) .",
    "in our analysis we will construct two cluster subsamples according to the total @xmath28-band luminosity @xmath18 from the member galaxies : a high - luminosity sample , consisting of 124 systems with @xmath44 , and a low - luminosity sample with 370 systems whose @xmath45 .",
    "the cluster luminosity @xmath18 is the sum of luminosities from all red member galaxies ( including the photometric members ) more luminous than @xmath46 , projected within a radius of @xmath30 mpc .",
    "as the sdss main sample has complete spectroscopic coverage ( modulo fiber collision ) for @xmath29 for all our clusters , no extrapolation in the luminosity function is needed to obtain @xmath18 .",
    "the division luminosity @xmath47 is chosen so that each subsample contains roughly equal number of galaxies .    in fig .",

    "the histograms are normalized to the total number of clusters in the respective samples ( red / solid : high - luminosity ; blue / dashed : low - luminosity ) .",
    "we see that @xmath48 of low - luminosity systems have at least 5 red galaxies above our chosen magnitude limit .",
    "as we will show below , our results are not dependent on the faintest or most luminous systems .",
    "[ fig : zd ] presents the normalized redshift distribution @xmath49 of the two subsamples ( red / dotted : high - luminosity ; blue / dashed : low - luminosity ) .",
    "we find that the two samples have similar @xmath49 : the median , mean , and @xmath50 scatter of the high - luminosity sample are 0.0662 , 0.0624 , and 0.0126 , respectively .",

    "the green / solid curve in the figure is the differential comoving volume element @xmath51 , scaled to the height of the distributions .",
    "the similarity between the redshift distributions and @xmath51 suggests that our samples are roughly volume - limited , and should be representative of the nearby groups and clusters .",
    "correlations between the luminosity of the bcgs and the properties of host clusters such as mass or total luminosity have been noted by previous studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we utilize the bcg luminosity  cluster luminosity correlation ( @xmath17@xmath18 ) to show that bcgs are indeed special  at least in luminous / massive clusters .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : lbcgltot ] ( top panel ) we show the observed @xmath17@xmath18 correlation for the c4 clusters .",

    "the meaning of the cyan crosses will be described below .      to check for the statistical nature of bcgs",
    ", we proceed as follows .",
    "based on the observed ld , we generate many realizations of the @xmath17@xmath18 correlation , from which we derive the mean @xmath17@xmath18 relation that is expected if the bcgs are drawn from the same ld as other cluster galaxies .",
    "we can then compare the observed mean @xmath17@xmath18 relation and determine if it is consistent with the mean from the mock data .",
    "we show in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lbcgltot ] one such realization .",
    "basically , for each cluster in our sample , we create a corresponding mock cluster by randomly drawing galaxies from the galaxy pool , until the total luminosity of the mock cluster matches that of the observed one ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : pool ] ) . specifically , suppose the first @xmath14 galaxies give a total luminosity of @xmath55 , and the next mock galaxy brings the total luminosity to @xmath56 .",
    "we keep the @xmath57-th galaxy if @xmath58 , otherwise we only use the first @xmath14 galaxies .",
    "because of this procedure , although the total luminosity for massive ( luminous ) clusters can be matched fairly well , for low luminosity clusters the difference in @xmath18 between the mock and real clusters can be large .",
    "the black squares in the middle panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : lbcgltot ] show the mean in bcg luminosity , @xmath59 in this particular ensemble of simulated clusters .",

    "it is found that for luminous clusters ( e.g. , @xmath61 ) , the observed @xmath54 is higher than @xmath60 from mock clusters ( e.g. , compare the magenta squares with the cyan crosses in the top panel ) . for low luminosity clusters , the observed and mock values are comparable .",

    "one might easily imagine a systematic measurement error that systematically gives too large a luminosity for bright galaxies .",

    "on the other hand , @xmath54 in low luminosity clusters scatter about @xmath60 , and @xmath62 and @xmath64 have a much higher probability ( @xmath70 ) to be drawn from the same distribution .",

    "in addition to the basic requirements ( @xmath33 , @xmath40 , projected within @xmath30  mpc ) , for the _ spectroscopic members _ , we only include galaxies whose ( 1 ) redshifts satisfy @xmath135 , where @xmath136 , ( 2 ) @xmath36 and @xmath37 colors fall in the range @xmath137 to @xmath138 , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the mean and dispersion of the @xmath36 and @xmath37 colors from the galaxies at redshifts broadly consistent with the cluster , ( 3 ) `` concentration parameter '' @xmath141 , where @xmath142 and @xmath143 are radii that enclose 90% and 50% of the petrosian flux , respectively ; this last condition aims to select galaxies with early type morphology @xcite .",
    "as for the _ photometric members _ , along with the filters in the @xmath28-band flux , @xmath144 color , spatial distribution , and morphology , we require that their @xmath36 and @xmath37 colors to lie between @xmath145 and @xmath146 , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 are now derived from the spectroscopic members .",
    "these criteria reduce our cluster and galaxy sample ; only 344 clusters containing 2819 galaxies are included .",
    "we find that the probability @xmath147 that @xmath62 and @xmath64 are drawn from the same distribution is 1.5% , 0.15% , and 67% for the whole , high luminosity , and low luminosity ( sub)samples .",
    "these values confirm the results found in  [ sec : statsig ] .",
    "we note in  [ sec : data ] that 20% ( @xmath148 ) of the bcgs are photometrically identified",
    ". some of these may be foreground / background galaxies . to evaluate the effect of possible contamination due to these photometric bcgs ,",
    "we repeat our analysis using the 397 clusters whose bcgs are spectroscopically confirmed members ( with the membership assignment criteria of  [ sec : data ] ) . based on the galaxy pool constructed from the 3661 galaxies in these clusters , we find that @xmath149 , 0.28% , and 27% , for the whole , high luminosity , and low luminosity ( sub)samples .",
    "although the absolute values of @xmath147 changes somewhat with respect to our nominal values recorded in table  [ tab : ours ] , the trend remains clear that the bcgs in high luminosity clusters are much less likely to be drawn from the same ld as other cluster members when compared to their counterparts in lower luminosity clusters .",
    "let us comment next on one effect our cluster selection may have on the results .",
    "the requirement that the clusters need to host at least two galaxies with @xmath29 potentially excludes systems dominated by a single @xmath150 galaxy , such as the `` fossil groups '' ( which are defined to have @xmath151 and extended x - ray emissions ) .",
    "these systems are believed to evolve in isolation , with last major merger with other galactic systems being long enough in the past that a dominant central galaxy can result from the dynamic friction @xcite .",
    "the bcgs in these groups would then deviate significantly from the statistical extreme , which makes them distinct from the other bcgs in low luminosity groups included in our sample .",
    "one might be concerned that the exclusion of fossil groups from our cluster sample may have contributed to our conclusion that , for the lower luminosity systems , there is no statistically significant deviation of bcgs from the statistical distribution of all cluster galaxies .",
    "however , given the rarity of the fossils ( number density @xmath152  mpc@xmath153 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we expect there to be at most @xmath154 such systems in the volume we sample ( @xmath155 , @xmath156 deg@xmath157 ) , and therefore our conclusion should be robust .",
    "we first investigate whether the way galaxy pool is constructed affects our results .",
    "instead of pouring galaxies from all clusters into one pool , we can create two pools separately for galaxies in high and low luminosity clusters .",
    "high and low luminosity mock clusters are then created from the respective pools .",
    "we find that @xmath158 and 92% for the high and low luminosity clusters , respectively .",
    "the trend is clear that bcgs in low luminosity clusters are far more likely to be the statistical extreme than their cousins in high luminosity systems .",
    "ccccccccccc    all & @xmath159 & 8.53 & @xmath160 & @xmath161 & @xmath162 & @xmath163 & @xmath164 & 1.38 & @xmath165 & 0.32 + high & @xmath166 & 12.62 & @xmath167 & @xmath168 & @xmath169 & @xmath170 & @xmath171 & 1.90 & @xmath172 & 0.25 + low & @xmath161 & 6.34 & @xmath173 & @xmath174 & @xmath175 & @xmath176 & @xmath177 & 1.35 & @xmath178 & 0.33    [ tab : fits ]    secondly , we note that instead of utilizing the galaxy pool , we can construct mock clusters using fits to the observed ld of cluster galaxies .",
    "the lds for the whole cluster sample , and for the high and low luminosity subsamples , are measured by the method developed in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for more details .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lfs ] . from top to bottom are the lds for the high luminosity clusters , the whole sample , and the low luminosity clusters .",
    "when bcgs are included , the @xcite function is not a good description of the lds . instead , the bright end may be more appropriately described by a log - normal distribution .",
    "therefore , in fitting the lds we consider both a bright end - truncated schechter function plus a gaussian , @xmath179 where @xmath180 , and a single schechter function .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table  [ tab : fits ] .    using the gaussian@xmath181schechter function fit to the whole sample as the ld",
    ", we find that for the whole , high , and low luminosity samples , @xmath182 , 0.013% , and 39% , respectively . if using the schechter function fit to the ld of the whole sample , @xmath183 , 0.015% , and 44% for the three ( sub)samples , respectively .",
    "these results are recorded in the third and fourth columns of table  [ tab : ours ] .",
    "we thus conclude that our results are robust irrespective of the way the mock clusters are constructed .",
    "another implication from this exercise is that our method does not rely on largely complete spectroscopic dataset like sdss ; as long as ( 1 ) one can determine the ld accurately ( e.g. , via a statistical background subtraction method ; @xcite ) , and ( 2 ) the cluster membership of bcgs can be reliably assigned , our test can be applied .",
    "we remark in  [ sec : intro ] concerning the difficulty in the measurement of the total light of the bcgs . here",
    "we examine the effect of underestimation of bcg luminosity ( and more generally , luminosity of galaxies with large angular extents ) on both our test and the tr tests .",
    "we address this issue by using two methods to obtain the best estimates of the true galaxy magnitudes for our galaxy sample .",
    "the first one is a re - measurement of the galaxy photometry from the reduced sdss images for every galaxy in our sample .",
    "the second one employs a statistical correction to the official sdss photometry .",
    "simply put , the reason that the sdss photometric pipeline has difficulties dealing with the photometry of large galaxies is because it is defaulted to use the `` local '' sky flux measured within regions of @xmath184 pixels ( @xmath185 ) in the ccd frames . in the case that a large fraction of a given region is occupied by galaxies , the sky background level will be biased high , and in turn the galaxy magnitude will be lower than the true value .",
    "a remedy is to use the `` global '' sky level measured in _",
    "frames _ of @xmath186 pixels ( @xmath187 ) . following this line of reasoning",
    ", @xcite devised a way to recover the true magnitude , given the crowdedness of a field , and the relative values of the local and global sky background .",
    "as our first approach , we adopt the methodology of @xcite to apply corrections to the magnitudes of the galaxies and change the cluster luminosity accordingly , and then use the modified galaxy catalogs ( and the galaxy pool ) to conduct our test and the tr tests .",
    "it is found that @xmath188 , 0.012% , and 49% , for the whole , high luminosity , and low luminosity cluster ( sub)samples , respectively . as for the tr tests , for the whole sample , @xmath189 ; for the high and low luminosity subsamples , @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively .    using an independent photometric reduction software ,",
    "@xcite quantified the degree of underestimation of the magnitudes of large galaxies by the official sdss pipeline .",
    "their tests suggest that , for early type galaxies with effective radius @xmath192 , the mean magnitude deficit is about 0.25 mag , with a @xmath193 scatter about 0.04 mag .",
    "they provided a fitting function that gives the mean deficit @xmath194 as a function of the angular size @xmath195 , which we use as the basis of our second method for recovering the true galaxy magnitudes .",
    "for every galaxy in our sample , we assume its magnitude was underestimated by the sdss pipeline by @xmath196 , where @xmath197 is a gaussian random variate with dispersion of 0.04 mag , and @xmath195 is determined from the de vaucouleur fits to the galaxy surface brightness profile ( see @xcite for details ) .    for the galaxy and cluster catalogs thus modified , we find that @xmath198 for the whole sample , and the probability to obtain @xmath199 and @xmath13 from the galaxy pool as low as the `` observed '' values is @xmath200 and @xmath201 , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability that @xmath62 and @xmath64 are drawn from the same distribution is @xmath188 .",
    "breaking the sample into high and low luminosity subsamples , the results are @xmath202 for the luminous clusters , and @xmath203 for the faint clusters . from our test",
    "we find that bcgs in high and low luminosity clusters have probabilities of @xmath204 and @xmath205 to be statistical .",
    "these results suggest that both our test and the tr tests are _ insensitive _ to the uncertainties in galaxy photometry due to sky subtraction .",
    "it is also important to check if the low luminosity clusters are systematically at lower redshifts than the luminous ones .",
    "if this were true , the issue with sky subtraction of the sdss pipeline may affect the photometry of bcgs in low luminosity clusters ( hereafter llcbcg ) more strongly than that of bcgs in high luminosity clusters ( hereafter hlcbcg ) , causing the photometry of llcbcg to be underestimated more than the case for hlcbcg .",
    "this would in turn affect our finding that llcbcg are consistent with being drawn from the same ld as other cluster galaxies (  [ sec : statsig ] ) .",
    "we have shown in  [",
    "sec : data ] that the high and low luminosity clusters have very similar redshift distribution , and therefore we do not think the photometry of llcbcg and hlcbcg is treated differently .",
    "the main result of the present study is that bcgs as a whole have a ld that is distinct from that of the majority of red cluster galaxies ( those with @xmath29 ) .",
    "this conclusion is primarily due to the high luminosities of hlcbcg , which has only 0.03% of probability to be drawn from the ld of all galaxies . on the contrary ,",
    "llcbcg are more likely to be simply the statistical extreme of the ld of all galaxies .    with the help of mock clusters , and the elements that come into the calculation of tr tests , one gains some insight into the bcg formation process . for high luminosity clusters ,",
    "we find that @xmath206 from the real data , while the corresponding values from the mock dataset are @xmath207 . therefore , although @xmath6 in real and mock clusters are comparable , in real clusters @xmath4 is higher that that in mock ones ( suggesting that real bcgs are on average 0.11 mag brighter than the statistical extrme ) .",
    "physics of bcg formation drives the magnitude gap to be larger than the statistical expectation .    to explain the origin of hlcbcg , one therefore needs to invoke galactic mergers ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is naturally expected within the hierarchical structure formation paradigm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the details of the mergers ( e.g. , major mergers between bcg and very luminous galaxies , minor mergers between bcg and @xmath208-type galaxies , or the `` galactic cannibalism '' ) remain to be understood .",
    "for example , while @xcite suggested that major mergers are a viable route for forming hlcbcg , @xcite were more in favor of minor mergers .    in principle",
    ", the extent of late mergers can be constrained by the @xmath17@xmath18 correlation , or statistics related to the magnitude gap between bcg and second - ranked galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have developed a simple merger model for cluster galaxies , and will present constraints on the importance of mergers based on the observations obtained in this paper in a future publication ( lin & ostriker 2009 , in preparation ) .    after confirming that bcgs are indeed different from the bulk of cluster galaxy population , it is natural to ask if bcgs are different from other luminous / massive cluster galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath209 ) .",
    "it has long been known that bcgs follow different scaling relations from other early type galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in the sense that the bcgs are larger , less dense , and have lower velocity dispersion , compared to other early type galaxies of the same luminosity .",
    "however , at the present it is not clear if the structure of the bcgs ( in terms of sersic fits ) is indeed different from non - bcg early type galaxies of comparable color and stellar mass ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we address this question somewhat indirectly ; in  [ sec : g2 ] it is shown that the ld of g2s in high luminosity clusters are consistent with that of the whole cluster galaxy population .",
    "( our method could not be robustly applied to examine the statistical nature of g2s in low luminosity clusters , unfortunately . )",
    "although we do not check the third - ranked brightest members , we believe a similar result will emerge for them .",
    "effectively , we suggest that among the most luminous , red , cluster members , only bcgs in high luminosity clusters show significant deviations from the statistical extreme , and therefore these galaxies are a distinct population .",
    "our results suggest both bcgs in low luminosity / mass clusters and g2s in luminous / massive clusters are the statistical extreme of the galaxy ld . as the latter are very likely bcgs ( in clusters or groups that merge with the current host clusters ) themselves at earlier stages of their lives , this finding seems to give a self - consistent picture of the luminous galaxy evolution within the hierarchical cluster evolution scenario .      the results and reasoning presented in  [ sec : g2 ] &  [ sec : bcgform ] suggest that lrgs that are bcgs in high luminosity ( massive ) clusters are different from other lrgs ( e.g. , those that are llcbcg and g2s or lower - ranked galaxies in high luminosity clusters ) , and call for very careful modeling and selection of the lrgs .",
    "suppose the finding that hlcbcg and llcbcg are two distinct populations continues to hold towards higher redshifts . in a flux - limited survey",
    ", the lrgs at higher redshifts would be intrinsically more luminous than those at lower-@xmath210 .",
    "therefore , a larger fraction of lrgs at higher-@xmath210 would be composed of hlcbcg , when compared to lrgs at lower-@xmath210 .",
    "when accounting for the malmquist bias present in the lrg sample , one can not simply assume that bcgs follow the same ld as lrgs as a whole , otherwise the inferred luminosity would be lower than the true value .",
    "this potential systematic effect would be larger towards higher-@xmath210 .",
    "it is thus important to take into account the difference in the ld of hlcbcg and llcbcg when creating mock lrg catalogs for bao surveys .",
    "unfortunately the bcgs in the present study are at lower redshifts ( @xmath211 ) even compared to sdss and sdss - ii lrg studies ( at @xmath212 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore the lds we measure ( see the gaussian fits in table  [ tab : fits ] ) are not readily applicable .",
    "accordingly our study strongly motivates for a systematic investigation on the @xmath17@xmath18 correlation at @xmath213 , either through direct observations ( similar to the methodology used in the present paper , utilizing spectroscopic data from e.g. , boss or gama surveys ) , through the halo occupation distribution analysis ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the non - parametric method of @xcite .      the question of whether the luminosity distribution of bcgs is drawn from the same ld as other cluster galaxies has been extensively discussed over the last four decades . here",
    "we propose a simple new test to examine the statistical nature of the bcgs , and to supplement the classical tests proposed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tr ) .",
    "our basic idea is to shuffle the cluster galaxies and see how likely the observed ld of bcgs can be reproduced .",
    "the procedure is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : pool ] . using a sample of 494 clusters from the c4 catalog at @xmath155 ,",
    "we combine all member galaxies with @xmath24 to form a big pool of galaxies ( 5980 in total ) .",
    "we then randomly pick up galaxies from the pool to create 494 mock clusters , whose total luminosities @xmath18 are matched to that of the real clusters as close as possible .",
    "this way we can compare the correlation between the bcg luminosity @xmath17 and @xmath18 of real and mock clusters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lbcgltot ] ) . of course , there are more than one way to create an ensemble of mock clusters , so we repeat this monte carlo process to generate 200 mock ensembles .",
    "the averaged bcg luminosity from all 200 realizations of mock datasets , @xmath60 , gives the expected value when bcgs are statistical , as a function of cluster luminosity .",
    "the differences between the logarithms of mean mock bcg luminosity ( @xmath59 ) from each ensemble and @xmath60 represent the degree of scatter expected if bcgs are stochastically selected from a global ld . in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] we compare the distribution of @xmath66 with that of @xmath214 , and find that the real bcgs are more luminous than the statistical expectation ; there is 0.8% of probability for @xmath62 to be drawn from the same distribution of @xmath64 ( see table  [ tab : ours ] ) . separating the clusters into high and low luminosity subsamples ( with a division luminosity of @xmath215 ) , we conclude that the difference is mainly coming from bcgs in high luminosity clusters ( only 0.03% chance to be statistical ) .",
    "the luminosities of bcgs in low luminosity clusters are roughly consistent with the global ld .",
    "we extend the analysis to discuss the statistical nature of the second brightest galaxies ( g2s ) , and find strong evidence that ( in high luminosity clusters ) , g2s have a ld similar to that of the whole cluster galaxy population .",
    "we also apply the tests proposed by tr to our cluster sample , and record the results in table  [ tab : tr ] .",
    "the two statistics ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) both suggest a small probability for bcgs to be statistical , consistent with our findings",
    ". however , examining the tr statistics for the high and low luminosity clusters reveals confusing trends .",
    "according to the @xmath12 statistic , bcgs in the high luminosity clusters are much less likely to be statistical than their counterparts in the low luminosity clusters .",
    "however , the @xmath13 statistic suggests the opposite conclusion .",
    "our results confirm previous findings that bcgs in high luminosity clusters are a distinct population from other cluster galaxies and tentatively supports the physical mechanism of cannibalism @xcite which is essentially dynamical friction .",
    "we also suggest that bcgs are distinct from other non - bcg lrgs .",
    "as the majority of lrgs are the brightest member in groups and clusters , such an effect should be taken into account in selecting a homogeneous sample of lrgs for on - going and future bao surveys .",
