    "the usefulness of such self - assembled nanostructures relies on the ability to obtain homogeneous size distributions as well as to control their size , density and position .",
    "many theoretical contributions have enhanced our understanding of the size distributions of sk - grown islands , but some controversy remains.@xcite also , despite many experimental studies , the influence of growth parameters on the size and density of such islands is not fully understood , owing to the complexity of the physics of strained layer growth .    in this work ,",
    "we present results on the nucleation of gan islands on aln following an sk mode , in particular on the dependence on the amount of deposited gan and the substrate temperature .",
    "we find that the qualitative behavior is similar to that found in other systems , e.g. for inas / gaas and ge / si . this reinforces the idea that there are common features of semiconductor sk growth , which are rather universal and independent of the specific material system .",
    "absolute island sizes then densities will depend on the material system , possibly through material parameters like lattice misfit , elastic constants , or surface energies . hence , we may further discuss the experimental data in the framework of an equilibrium model based on statistical physics that was originally developed in work on the ge / si system.@xcite",

    "it is worth noting that no measurable influence of the growth rate on gan island properties has been found in the range between 0.1 and 0.6ml / s .",

    "a shoulder appears at the high island side of the distribution and transforms into a clearly separated second mode at higher temperatures .",
    "hence , we find that bimodal distributions occur earlier ( for lower gan coverage ) at higher substrate temperature .",
    "another remarkable finding is that the height of the mode 1 islands remains constant as a function of temperature , whereas the height of mode 2 islands increases with temperature , again without signs of saturation in the examined temperature range .       * ( a ) * island height as a function of diameter for mode 1 islands obtained for two gan coverages , as indicated .",

    "remarkably , when bimodal distributions occur , the size of mode 1 islands ( smaller islands ) appears independent of growth parameters such as gan coverage and substrate temperature .",
    "as discussed above , the variation of partial densities of both modes implies that first mode 1 islands are nucleated , their density saturates and the growth proceeds further by transformation of mode 1 islands into mode 2 islands .",
    "thus the question arises , whether this transformation involves a shape change of the islands similar to the behavior observed in the ge / si system , where pyramidal islands are observed to transform into `` dome''-shaped islands during growth.@xcite some information about the island shape can be gathered by rheed .",
    "the rheed images corresponding to pure mode 1 island morphologies and morphologies with a mixture of mode 1 and mode 2 islands ( but with a majority of mode 2 islands ) are both characterized by the same @xmath28 facets , showing a six - fold rotation symmetry .",
    "it thus appears that both types of islands are ( truncated ) hexagonal pyramids with @xmath28 sidewalls , in agreement with previous results.@xcite however , it is clear that the shape of such islands can not be obtained from the rheed pattern alone and further work is necessary to determine the precise shape of both types of islands .",
    "a more detailed analysis can be done by extracting the aspect ratio @xmath29 of the islands from the afm data .",
    "figure [ fig : aspectratio](a ) depicts the aspect ratio of mode 1 islands for two different gan coverages ( at which monomodal height distributions are observed ) at a substrate temperature of @xmath30@xmath4c . in spite of the absolute increase of the islands size , their aspect ratio remains constant and",

    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : volumeftheta ] .",
    "we find that the data are consistent with a 2ml thick wetting layer , independent of the amount of deposited gan .",
    "it thus appears that in this system , the wetting layer is stable and does not contribute to island growth .",
    "the deviation for gan coverages just after the critical thickness of 2.25ml can be explained by the presence of 2d precursor islands , which still contain significant material but are not taken into account as 3d islands .",
    "in order to understand more precisely why the observed island distributions form , we analyze the nitride nanostructure growth in terms of a thermodynamic equilibrium model that has so far only been applied extensively to the ge / si system.@xcite to date , little effort has been made to fit data on size distributions of nitride nanostructures to any model .",
    "nakajima _ _ et al.__@xcite have undertaken a purely theoretical study and explicitly derived thickness - composition phase diagrams for the expected growth mode for gainn / gan and gainn / aln , using known materials parameters .",
    "however they did not take into account the shapes and sizes of experimentally observed nitride nanostructures , nor did they seek to predict size distributions . here",
    "we take a rather different approach .",
    "we apply the thermodynamic model to the afm data on nitride nanostructure distributions grown at one particular temperature in order to assess whether the bimodal distributions of nanostructures are consistent with thermodynamic equilibrium , as opposed to being configurations along an unstable ripening trajectory .",
    "the experimental distributions are described reasonably well by the model , as explained below .",
    "we then apply the model to understand the variations in the bimodal distributions with growth temperature at fixed coverage , and again find reasonable agreement over a range of growth temperatures .",
    "the thermodynamic equilibrium model makes explicit predictions for the form of the bimodal epitaxial nanostructure distributions .",
    "the model is governed by a set of parameters that describes the size dependence of the internal energy of an epitaxial nanostructure .",
    "following shchukin _",
    "et al._,@xcite we describe the internal energy @xmath31 of the @xmath32th individual island of type @xmath33 and volume @xmath34 as follows :    @xmath35    using this expression for the internal energy , the island size distribution @xmath36 is given by    @xmath37    where @xmath2 is the chemical potential and @xmath38 is boltzmann s constant .",
    "equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) describes the chemical and elastic contributions to the island energy .",
    "the first term arises from bulk strain , the second from surface and interfacial energies and island - island interactions , and the third from surface stress and edge energies ( suppressing the log dependence of the edge elastic relaxation energy ) .",
    "the equation also includes a size - independent term that is relevant only insofar as it differs from one nanostructure type to another . for the internal energy ( [ eq : energy ] ) , a minimum may exist if @xmath39 and @xmath40 have opposite signs .",
    "there has been some debate over which of the two constants is likely to be positive and which negative . in the initial development of a `` shape - map '' for the bimodal ge / si system by williams _",

    "al.__@xcite have suggested that @xmath39 should be positive , since a ge(001 ) surface does not spontaneously roughen , though they also acknowledge that , since 3d growth is preceded by the appearance of increasing numbers of defects in the wetting layer with their own associated energy , the behaviour of the ge(001 ) surface of a bulk crystal may not be relevant and @xmath39 could be negative . here",
    ", we find that the option most consistent with the nanostructure size distributions observed by afm is @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    unlike in the most recent developments of the equilibrium model,@xcite we have not , as yet , explicitly included the effects of the elastic interaction between pairs of islands .",
    "we also have not undertaken a self - consistent calculation of the chemical potential .",
    "instead , we have taken a similar approach to williams _",
    "et al._:@xcite using the expressions for the distributions ( [ eq : distribution ] ) and internal energies ( [ eq : energy ] ) , we have fitted the model to the available data at several coverages and temperatures , in order to determine approximately how the constants @xmath43 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath44 vary as a function of growth parameters . for convenience , we have introduced @xmath45 .",
    "we then used our empirical functions to fit the model across multiple data sets , to determine how well it compares with the overall behaviour of the system . by comparison with the more sophisticated work of rudd _ _ et al.__@xcite on ge / si",
    ", we expect @xmath39 to be dependent on the coverage and @xmath43 to depend on the chemical potential , a non - trivial function of coverage and temperature .      in investigating the variation of the parameters @xmath43 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath44 as a function of coverage",
    ", we found that @xmath40 and @xmath44 could be treated as being independent of coverage , but that @xmath39 increased monotonically with increasing coverage .",
    "this coverage dependence is consistent with elastic island - island interactions , which are expected to scale with @xmath46 , and which will increase with increasing coverage .",
    "@xmath47 could be approximated to a straight line with non - zero slope for both the smaller ( @xmath48 ) and the larger ( @xmath49 ) island types .",

    "the model contains a large number of parameters for which little _ a priori _ information is available in the nitride systems , and the measured island distributions would benefit from more data in order to reduce the statistical uncertainty .",

    "one surprising feature of the fits is that @xmath43 is found to be positive for the larger islands , for all coverages .",

    "the function @xmath78 , which has not been found explicitly , includes the temperature dependence of the chemical potential , and any variation in the elastic relaxation with temperature .",
    "this model is only valid if a quasi - equilibrium may be assumed .",
    "this assumption is particularly problematic with regards to variation in temperature , since in particular at lower temperatures , the system may not reach equilibrium , whilst at higher temperatures significant interdiffusion between the islands and the substrate may occur .",
    "this alloying will effectively reduce the mismatch between the islands and the substrate - strongly affecting the island size distributions , since the mean equilibrium nanostructure volume varies inversely as the sixth power of the mismatch.@xcite rudd _ et al . _",
    "s more sophisticated work,@xcite in creating the nanostructure diagram for the ge / si system , could be augmented to account for uniformly distributed alloying , and for kinetic effects . in the past ,",
    "whilst the temperature dependence of the equilibrium island size distribution has been considered theoretically,@xcite very little high quality data has been available for comparison .",
    "the experimental studies by williams _ _ et al.__@xcite only involved temperatures of 550@xmath4c , 600@xmath4c , and 650@xmath4c , and there was considerable uncertainty in the temperature measurement . additionally , the sample grown at 550@xmath4c is believed to have been significantly influenced by kinetic effects , and the sample grown at 650@xmath4c experienced significant intermixing .",
    "hence the data considered here , relating to a smaller range of more accurately measured temperatures , are very valuable as a first quantitative test of the temperature dependence of the equilibrium model .",
    "in addition , the gan / aln system presents an important advantage over the ge / si system since it has been show that alloying is very limited even at high growth temperatures.@xcite    in considering the results of the fitting , we notice that fitting across the temperature data sets gives a higher @xmath68 than fitting across the coverage data , with an essentially similar fitting methodology .",
    "one might thus speculate that , since the samples used for the coverage data set were grown at the relatively low temperature of 730@xmath4c , full equilibrium has not been achieved and kinetic effects are having some influence . a worthwhile approach , in investigating this further , will be to examine a series of samples that have been annealed at growth temperature to allow further evolution towards equilibrium .",
    "using _ ex situ _ afm , we have studied the evolution of thin gan layers grown by plasma - assisted mbe on aln(0001 ) layers at substrate temperatures between 700 and 750@xmath4c .",
    "initially , 2ml of gan grow in a 2d mode , followed by the occurrence of 2d islands .",
    "these islands act as precursors for 3d islands , which appear after an sk transition around 2.3ml . during further growth , in particular at higher temperatures , a bimodal island size distribution is observed .",
    "remarkably , the size of mode 1 islands is found to be independent of coverage and temperature , whereas the size of mode 2 islands increases with coverage and temperature .",
    "the analysis of the partial island densities reveals that , whilst the total island density remains constant , mode 1 islands transform during growth into mode 2 islands .",
    "the aspect ratio of the islands is measured for both types of islands and it is found that they are characterized by distinctively different aspect ratios , whereas no additional facets are observed in the rheed pattern due to mode 2 islands .",
    "these findings are examined in the framework of an equilibrium model for sk growth .",
    "we find satisfactory agreement with the experimental data , suggesting that , as more data become available , extending the equilibrium approach may be helpful in understanding and tailoring nitride nanostructure distributions .",
    "we have examined the variation of each of the fitting parameters with growth conditions , and have considered how this may relate to the physics of this system .",
    "the calculated parameters appear to be compatible with the available data  for example the @xmath39-parameter , relating to the surface energy of the islands shows a similar variation with growth parameters for each island type , which is unsurprising if both island types are dominated by the same facet . however , the fits are in no way perfect , and this may be due to the influence of kinetic effects on the island distributions .",
    "further experiments on the annealing of dot arrays at growth temperature might clarify to what extent the growth proceeds near equilibrium or kinetic effects are predominant .",
