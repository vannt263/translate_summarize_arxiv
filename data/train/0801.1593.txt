    "the representation of coherent states has been used to describe a wide variety of physical systems  @xcite . in particular , coherent states provide a natural phase space representation of quantum mechanics and are specially well suited to the study of the semiclassical limit .",
    "the coherent state representation was first formalized by bargmann in 1961 @xcite and later used by glauber @xcite to describe the electromagnetic field in quantum electrodynamics .",
    "fairly complete review articles on coherent states and applications can be found in references  @xcite .",
    "the quantum propagator @xmath0 represents the probability amplitude that an initial coherent state @xmath1 evolves into another coherent state @xmath2 after a time @xmath3 .",
    "a path integral formulation for this propagator was introduced by klauder  @xcite .",
    "the paths contributing to @xmath4 are those connecting @xmath5 to @xmath6 . in the semiclassical limit",
    ", it turns out that the most important paths are complex classical trajectories governed by the hamiltonian function @xmath7 , with boundary conditions involving the average values @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "klauder was the first to consider this type of approximation  @xcite , being followed by a number of other contributors  @xcite .",
    "more recently , a detailed derivation of the semiclassical coherent state propagator for one dimensional systems was published  @xcite . in the last two decades",
    "much numerical and analytical work has been done in semiclassical methods with coherent states for one  @xcite and two  @xcite dimensional systems .",
    "a recent review can be found in reference  @xcite .    while the semiclassical propagator is usually very accurate for short times , phase space caustics and non - contributing trajectories inevitably appear as @xmath3 increases , introducing large errors and imperfections  @xcite .",
    "non - contributing trajectories must be identified and excluded from the calculation because their contributions to the propagator are non - physical . from the mathematical point of view , non - contributing trajectories correspond to forbidden deformations of the contour of integration necessary to carry out the stationary phase approximation that leads to the semiclassical formula .",
    "phase space caustics , on the other hand , are special points where the amplitude of the semiclassical propagator diverges and the approximation simply breaks down . in order to calculate the propagator in the vicinity of caustics one needs to improve the semiclassical approximation , going beyond the usual quadratic expansion .",
    "in two recent papers  @xcite we have derived a uniform approximation for the coherent state propagator that remains finite in the presence of phase space caustics .",
    "the derivation involved the introduction of a dual representation for the coherent states and the method of maslov  @xcite . in the present article",
    ", we review the formalism used in these previous papers and apply it to the one - dimensional quartic oscillator and to the two dimensional chaotic nelson potential .",
    "we show that the uniform formula completely eliminates the divergences caused by the caustics , providing a very accurate semiclassical description of the propagator in these regions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in the next section we briefly review the representation of coherent states and the quantum propagator .",
    "section  [ secondorder ] describes the semiclassical approximation to the propagator based on a second order expansion around stationary trajectories .",
    "the dual representation for coherent states is introduced in section  [ dualrep ] and used in section  [ uniformapp ] to derive the uniform approximation . in sections  [ quart ] and [ nelson ] we present numerical applications of the uniform formula and , in section  [ final ] , we present our final remarks .",
    "let @xmath12 be the hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator of mass @xmath13 and frequency @xmath14 .",
    "the normalized coherent states of @xmath15 are defined by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the oscillator s ground state .",
    "the real labels @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the average values of the position and momentum operators respectively and the length scales @xmath21 and @xmath22 satisfy @xmath23",
    ". three important properties of the coherent states are ( over)completeness , overlap relation and eigenvalue equation : @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26    it will also be important in the derivation of our uniform approximation to define non - normalized coherent states , or bargmann states @xcite , by @xmath27 for these states the unit operator and the overlap equation become @xmath28 the quantum propagator in the bargmann and the coherent states representations are given , respectively , by @xmath29 and @xmath30 these two quantities contain the same physical information and differ only in the normalization .",
    "for the purposes of the theory to be developed in sections  [ dualrep ] and [ uniformapp ] it shall be more convenient to work with the bargmann states .",
    "the propagator @xmath31 can be written in terms of path integrals , from which standard semiclassical approximations can be performed . here",
    "we present a very brief summary of path integral formulation , referring to  @xcite for the details .",
    "the first step is to divide the propagation time @xmath3 into @xmath32 small intervals of size @xmath33 so that @xmath34 .",
    "the path integral formula , obtained by evaluating the expression for each resulting infinitesimal propagator @xmath35 , reads as @xmath36 } , \\label{pi}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath37 and identified @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "equation  ( [ pi ] ) represents the path integral formula of the quantum propagator .",
    "written as a function of the numbers @xmath40 , the propagator becomes an infinite sum of contributions of all possible phase space paths linking the initial point @xmath41 to the final @xmath42 .",
    "by taking the formal semiclassical limit @xmath43 , the integrals  ( [ pi ] ) can be performed  @xcite by the saddle point method  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that critical paths , those whose contribution to the integral are relevant , are classical trajectories @xmath44 , satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath45 and governed by the average hamiltonian @xmath46 .",
    "one might think initially that the trajectory starting at @xmath47 and ending at @xmath48 would be the only solution to these equations . however , these boundary conditions are very restrictive and such a trajectory usually does not exist : indeed , giving the _ initial position and initial momentum _",
    ", the trajectory is completely determined so that the final point @xmath49 is generally different from @xmath42 .",
    "this means that , in general , there is no _ real _ critical path to the integral  ( [ pi ] ) .",
    "complex trajectories , however , can usually be found if we analytically extend the integration to the complex phase space , letting @xmath50 and @xmath51 be complex variables .    in this case",
    "it is more convenient to introduce new variables @xmath52 and @xmath53 , instead of using the complex position @xmath50 and momentum @xmath51 , such that @xmath54 in terms of @xmath52 and @xmath53 the classical equations of motion become @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and the boundary conditions assume a simpler form , @xmath57 notice that this _ does not _ imply that @xmath58 and @xmath59 . given @xmath60 and @xmath61 a complex trajectory @xmath62 can be calculated and the values of @xmath63 and @xmath64 come out of this calculation . in general",
    "there might be more than one trajectory governed by  ( [ emuv ] ) and satisfying  ( [ bbuv ] ) .",
    "returning to eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) , by expanding the exponent up to second order around the complex classical path , we find the following semiclassical formula for the propagator @xmath65 where the index @xmath66 means `` second order expansion '' .",
    "the sum in eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) is over the complex classical trajectories , as discussed , and @xmath67 dt -\\frac{i\\hbar}{2}\\left [ {   u(t ) { z''}^ * + z'v(0 ) } \\right],\\label{action}\\\\ \\mathcal{g}({z''}^*,z ' , t ) & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{0}^{t } \\frac{\\partial^{2}\\tilde{h}}{\\partial u \\ ; \\partial v } \\ , dt .",
    "\\label{gfactor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] finally @xmath68 is an element of the tangent matrix @xmath69 defined by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are small displacements around the classical trajectory .",
    "the elements of the tangent matrix are related to second derivatives of the action @xmath73",
    "the phase of @xmath68 contains important maslov phases .",
    "the corresponding semiclassical formula for @xmath74 is identical , except that it does not have the normalization factor in the exponent .    in the strict limit where @xmath75 , the semiclassical propagator becomes a delta function at the phase space point @xmath42 linked to @xmath41 by a real classical trajectory .",
    "therefore , for small but finite @xmath76 , we expect large contributions to the propagator arising from nearly real trajectories .",
    "the more the trajectory wanders into the complex @xmath20 and @xmath19 space , the less it should contribute to @xmath77 . by inspection of eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) , we see that this statement is true only if the real part of the exponent in ( [ sp ] ) is negative",
    ". trajectories for which such real part is positive furnish non - physical contributions to the propagator that become arbitrarily large when @xmath76 goes to zero .",
    "these are non - contributing trajectories and must be excluded from the calculation .",
    "they correspond to complex critical paths whose steepest descent contour of integration can not be reached by deformations allowed by cauchy s theorem .",
    "their structure are closely related to the _ stokes phenomenon _",
    "@xcite , discussed in a number of papers on semiclassical approximations  @xcite . in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite shows an explicit example where non - contributing trajectories arise from forbidden deformations of the original contour of integration .",
    "another common source of complications in semiclassical formulas are focal points or caustics .",
    "these are special points where the second order approximation breaks down because of singularities in the formula s pre - factor . in the case of @xmath77",
    "this happens when @xmath78 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ mmatrix ] ) , if @xmath68 goes to 0 , we can set small initial displacements @xmath79 and @xmath80 such that @xmath81 and @xmath82 , implying that there are at least two nearby trajectories satisfying the correct boundary conditions  ( [ bbuv ] ) .",
    "the point where these trajectories coalesce is called a _ phase space caustic _ and the semiclassical formula  ( [ sp ] ) fails in its vicinity .",
    "contrary to non - contributing trajectories , trajectories going through caustics can not simply be excluded , since the problem lies on the approach used , and not on the orbit itself .",
    "thus , to evaluate the semiclassical propagator in the vicinity of phase space caustics one needs better approximations , beyond the second order .",
    "we derive such an approximation in the next two sections .",
    "the most direct way to improve the quadratic approximation is to go back to eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) and expand the exponent of the propagator to third order around the critical paths .",
    "this , however , would be extremely complicated , since the integral  ( [ pi ] ) is multi - dimensional .",
    "a simpler solution is to follow the method proposed by maslov  @xcite .",
    "to illustrate the idea , suppose that a semiclassical approximation for @xmath83 has a singularity at @xmath84 . if we know the corresponding semiclassical formula for @xmath85 in the momentum representation we can write @xmath86 if the integral over @xmath20 is performed by the usual second order stationary phase approximation , the singularity in @xmath87 is recovered",
    ". however , doing a third order stationary phase approximation produces a more accurate expression involving an airy function which remains finite at @xmath88  @xcite . therefore , maslov s method consists in finding the desired semiclassical approximation in a conjugate representation and transforming back to the original one by a third order expansion .",
    "the problem in applying this idea to coherent states is that they are defined in phase space and do not have a natural dual representation . since @xmath89 and",
    "@xmath90 play the role of conjugate variables , we can think of @xmath89 as @xmath19 and @xmath90 as @xmath20 , and the coherent state propagator is always written in the mixed @xmath91 representation .",
    "it is impossible to write it in @xmath92 or @xmath93 forms , since one can not write a matrix element with two kets or two bras . to overcome this difficulty we need to define a proper linear application to play the role of the dual representation and we shall do that using the non - normalized bargmann representation .    given the propagator @xmath74 , the associated dual propagator is defined as @xmath94 and the inverse application by @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are convenient paths as specified in ref .",
    "these equations are reminiscent of ( [ masqp ] ) .",
    "notice that equation ( [ ktil ] ) can also be written as @xmath98 which can be interpreted as an attempt to ` cancel ' the bra @xmath99 and introduce another ket @xmath100 .",
    "of course @xmath101 is not a matrix element and , therefore , the above application is not a true representation .",
    "equation  ( [ ktilinv ] ) is the starting point to make improvements on @xmath102 . in the regions where",
    "both propagators are free of caustics , the semiclassical version of @xmath103 can be obtained by performing the integral  ( [ ktil ] ) using the standard second order saddle point method with @xmath104 replaced by @xmath105 .",
    "the result is  @xcite @xmath106 the trajectories summed in this equation are not the same as those of eq .",
    "( [ sp ] ) , since they satisfy the conditions @xmath60 and @xmath107 .",
    "as usual , @xmath63 and @xmath108 are not fixed , but come out of the integration of hamilton s equations with the above boundary conditions .",
    "the tangent matrix element @xmath109 is given by eq .",
    "( [ mmatrix ] ) and @xmath110 is the function @xmath111 calculated with the new trajectory . the new action @xmath112 is the legendre transform of @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is obtained from the relation @xmath115 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ mmatrix ] ) , when @xmath116 is zero , @xmath117 is usually not zero , which implies that if @xmath118 has a caustic for a complex trajectory satisfying @xmath60 , @xmath61 , implying values of @xmath64 and @xmath63 , then @xmath119 will not have a caustic when calculated at the same trajectory , i.e. , for @xmath60 and @xmath120 .",
    "inserting  ( [ ktil2 ] ) into  ( [ ktilinv ] ) leads to @xmath121 where we omit the sum for simplicity .",
    "( [ ktilinvsc ] ) is an integral representation for the semiclassical coherent state propagator . in order to calculate it we need to sum the contributions of all trajectories starting at @xmath60 and ending at @xmath107 lying on the curve @xmath96",
    "( [ sp ] ) is recovered if the second order saddle point method is applied to  ( [ ktilinvsc ] ) , the critical paths being precisely the orbits given by eqs .  ( [ emuv ] ) and ( [ bbuv ] ) .    expanding the exponent of eq .",
    "( [ ktilinvsc ] ) to third order around the critical paths leads to the so called regular approximation derived in  @xcite .",
    "the regular formula provides satisfactory results only if the critical trajectories are not too close to caustics , so that each trajectory still contributes independently to the propagator . for the transitional approximation",
    ", the exponent of ( [ ktilinvsc ] ) is expanded around the trajectory that lies exactly at the phase space caustic . since",
    "this trajectory is not a critical one , the formula is good only if critical trajectories are sufficiently close to the caustic . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned only with uniform approximations , which provide a global semiclassical formula , reasonably accurate over all the space spanned by the parameters @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath3 .",
    "a uniform approximation for the coherent state propagator was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for one - dimensional systems and in ref .",
    "@xcite for two dimensions .",
    "the expression presented here is slightly different from those in refs .",
    "@xcite , as we point out below .",
    "the simplest type of singularity that can appear in the semiclassical propagator occurs when two nearby trajectories coalesce at the caustic . in this case",
    "the function @xmath124 has two stationary points ( corresponding to two complex trajectories satisfying the same boundary conditions ) that coalesce as @xmath125 ( here considered as a parameter ) approaches the caustic .",
    "the basic idea of the uniform approximation is to map this complicated function into a simpler function with the same critical points and the same behavior in the neighborhoods of these points  @xcite",
    ". since all that matters in the semiclassical limit is the neighborhood of the critical points , the integral with the new function should give about the same results as the integral with the original function .",
    "in the case of two coalescing trajectories the appropriate function is @xmath126 , which has two saddle points at @xmath127 that coalesce as @xmath128 .",
    "therefore we write [ see eq .",
    "( [ ktilinvsc ] ) ] @xmath129 where the function @xmath130 includes the jacobian of the transformation @xmath131 and the contribution of the smooth term @xmath132 . in refs .",
    "@xcite the logarithm of this term was also included in the function @xmath133 .",
    "however , since @xmath134 varies slowly with @xmath76 it is reasonable to leave it out . from the numerical point of view",
    "it turns out that the present prescription is also more accurate than the ones in  @xcite .    imposing that the value of @xmath135 at the saddle points @xmath127 coincide with the value of @xmath136 at critical points @xmath137 ( related to the two critical trajectories of  ( [ ktilinvsc ] ) ) we find @xmath138^{2/3 } , \\label{ab}\\ ] ] where @xmath139 is the complex action of the trajectory related to @xmath140 .",

    "the index @xmath158 refers to three possible paths of integration @xmath159 , giving rise to three different airy functions  @xcite .",
    "the correct path is determined by cauchy s theorem , but , in practice , we can use physical criteria to justify the choice of @xmath159 .",
    "the normalized propagator @xmath160 is obtained multiplying @xmath161 by @xmath162 .    to finish this section",
    "we emphasize that the application of the uniform semiclassical formula ( [ uform ] ) always involves the two complex trajectories coalescing at the caustic and the choice of a contour of integration . in the next two sections we present numerical examples where these trajectories and the integration path will be pointed out explicitly .",
    "as a first application of the uniform approximation we consider the one - dimensional quartic oscillator .",
    "this simple system illustrates well the problems of non - contributing trajectories and phase space caustics .",
    "moreover , the structure of the complex phase space is easy to visualize and shows clearly the complications that arise as the propagation time increases .",
