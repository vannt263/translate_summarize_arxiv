    "[ fig : nrg - g ] the spectral function is plotted for various @xmath2 in the case of half - filling .",

    "for all values of @xmath2 in fig .",
    "[ fig : nrg - g ] the system is assumed to be in the fermi - liquid phase .",
    "as the interaction increases , spectral weight is redistributed from the vicinity of the fermi level to the hubbard subbands which are peaked at frequency @xmath71 , and the well - known three - peak structure of the spectral density emerges .",
    "the central spectral peak vanishes at the metal - insulator transition , which occurs at @xmath72.@xcite      there are three crossing points visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : nrg - g ] .",
    "the first one , at @xmath73 , has a simple explanation : in infinite dimensions luttinger s theorem entails that the chemical potential @xmath24 in the interacting system must be shifted according to@xcite @xmath74 in order to keep the number of particles fixed , where @xmath75 is the fermi energy for the non - interacting system with the same number of particles .",
    "thus the value of the green function @xmath76 at the fermi level is independent of @xmath2 in the metallic phase , and the crossing point at @xmath73 is exact . that the curves do not really cross but only touch is a consequence of the particle - hole symmetry at half - filling , which implies @xmath77 . for any other density or an asymmetric dos",
    "there is a true crossing point at @xmath73 .",
    "the other two crossing points of @xmath60 are situated at @xmath78 .",
    "in contrast to the pinning at @xmath73 , their explanation is more complicated .",
    "the crossing region at @xmath79 is very narrow for intermediate values of @xmath2 ( @xmath80 , fig .",
    "[ fig : nrg - g]a ) . for smaller values of @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nrg - g]b ) , we observe that the region of crossing points is less confined .",
    "the crossing points move up and inward as @xmath2 is increased . however , as shown below the crossing _",
    "frequency _ does not depend strongly on @xmath2 up to @xmath81 .",
    "let us first establish that curves @xmath0 vs.   @xmath1 for different values of @xmath2 always cross at some frequency @xmath42 , defined by @xmath82 that two such curves _ must _ cross follows from the sum rules @xmath83 where @xmath40 is the density .",
    "the derivatives of these equations with respect to @xmath2 yields @xmath84 and thus @xmath85 vanishes either identically or changes sign at least at one point in each of the intervals @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "this is the location of the crossing point .",
    "however , the existence of a solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - crossing ] ) is not sufficient for the observation of a sharp crossing point as in fig .",
    "[ fig : nrg - g]a . in general the crossing frequency @xmath42 , and also the value @xmath88 of @xmath60 at this point depends on @xmath2 .",
    "this becomes directly evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : nrg - crossing ] , where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are plotted as a function of @xmath2 . since these data were obtained from the intersections of curves @xmath0 differing by @xmath91 , while a solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - crossing ] ) corresponds to taking @xmath92 , they have to be understood as rather rough estimates for @xmath42 and @xmath93 .",
    "furthermore , the resolution of the nrg data at @xmath94 is already much lower than in the vicinity of the fermi level . nevertheless , fig .",
    "[ fig : nrg - crossing ] clearly shows that the strong variation of @xmath93 with @xmath2 ( for small @xmath2 ) causes the crossing region to become much narrower when only intermediate @xmath2 are plotted as in fig .",
    "[ fig : nrg - g]a .",
    "by contrast the value of @xmath42 remains close to the non - interacting band - edge @xmath95 for all @xmath2 up to @xmath96 .",
    "the variation of @xmath93 and @xmath42 with @xmath2 , i.e. , the derivatives @xmath97 and @xmath98 are not independent .",
    "the latter is given by @xmath99 and since the first term vanishes by definition [ eq .  ( [ eq : a - crossing ] ) ] we obtain the basic relation @xmath100 in the present case @xmath97 is small for all @xmath101 , while the derivative @xmath102 diverges as @xmath2 approaches zero .",
    "this is because @xmath60 approaches the non - interacting dos @xmath65 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho - bethe ] ) ] and @xmath42 moves to the band - edge where @xmath65 has a van - hove singularity .",
    "thus an almost constant crossing frequency @xmath42 is not in contradiction to a large variation of @xmath90 .",
    "as discussed above , well - defined crossing points in @xmath60 exist not only at intermediate @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : nrg - g]a ) but also at small @xmath2 ( fig .",

    "we now investigate the behavior of @xmath42 in the limit of small @xmath2 by means of many - body weak - coupling perturbation theory ( sec .",

    "we start with a short summary of weak - coupling perturbation theory for the local green function in the paramagnetic phase of the hubbard model . for @xmath104 one can use a perturbative expansion @xmath105 for the self - energy @xmath59 , where the functions @xmath106 are given by the sum over all irreducible feynman diagrams with @xmath40 vertices .",
    "it is convenient to perform this expansion relative to the hartree approximation.@xcite the series ( [ eq : sigma - expansion ] ) is then rearranged such that each line in the feynman diagrams for @xmath107 is replaced by the hartree expression for the green function , and in turn all feynman diagrams which contain first - order self - energy insertions are omitted .",
    "then @xmath108 is just given by the static hartree self - energy @xmath109 , and only a single feynman diagram contributes to @xmath110 .    in the following",
    "we discuss only the case @xmath111 , for which the hubbard model on a bipartite lattice becomes half - filled and particle - hole symmetric .",

    "( [ eq : luttinger ] ) to rewrite this derivative as @xmath120 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : luttinger ] ) and the fact that the first - order self - energy @xmath112 is static , it follows that @xmath121 for @xmath122 . thus @xmath123 vanishes",
    "identically . in particular",
    "one has @xmath124 for half - filling . however , instead of looking for a sign change in @xmath125 as in eq .",

    "when solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : a - crossing2 ] ) for small @xmath2 , special care has to be taken to handle the singularity of @xmath130 at the band - edges correctly .",
    "the leading contribution is given by @xmath132 the perturbative self - energy @xmath110 is continuous and at least differentiable once as seen from eq .",

    "we can thus replace @xmath135 by its value at the band - edge , @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the result is @xmath138 for @xmath122 . because @xmath139 this implies a sign change of the derivative @xmath126 at @xmath134 , and thus the crossing point tends towards the band - edge in the limit of small @xmath2 .",
    "because the self - energy has an expansion only in even powers of @xmath2 one might expect that the same is true also for the crossing point @xmath89 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , this would imply that for small @xmath2 the crossing frequency varies only weakly in the sense that the linear term @xmath140 is absent .",
    "on the other hand , the square root in @xmath63 at @xmath141 may cause @xmath89 to become nonanalytic at @xmath127 .",
    "however , as we will now show that these nonanalytic contributions occur only in higher order terms , and that the solution of ( [ eq : a - crossing2 ] ) for small @xmath2 is of the type @xmath142 to single out the nonanalyticity of @xmath130 in eq .",

    "the solution of this , @xmath158 , together with the behavior of @xmath159 noted above , yields after some manipulation @xmath160    the results of this section are easily generalized for any non - interacting dos with a van - hove singularity @xmath161 at the band - edge @xmath94 , as , e.g. , for the dos for a simple cubic lattice .",
    "this is because the dependence of @xmath162 and @xmath163 on @xmath65 is linear .",
    "the singular part of @xmath164 can be split off and the remaining continuous part does not enter the first - order result for @xmath42 . we thus conclude that a van - hove singularity at a band - edge implies that in its vicinity a crossing point in the spectrum exists for small @xmath2 , provided that @xmath165 and @xmath166 have the same sign .",
