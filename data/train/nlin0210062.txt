    "diffusion of particles in an infinite domain billiard is a well studied problem [ 1 - 5,9,14 ] . by a billiard",

    "a modification of the two dimensional lorentz gas in which there are circular scatterers on a square lattice is an example of an infinite horizon billiard , called the sinai billiard [ 5 ] , and is illustrated in fig .",

    "we then evolve the orbit of each particle in the cloud forward in time [ 8 ] and obtain @xmath32 .",
    "in all cases the results we obtain are consistent with ( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "the motivation for choosing an initial distribution uniform in space and angle is that motion of an orbit from a typical initial condition in the billiards of fig .",

    "the difference between particle transport in an infinite horizon billiard and particle transport in the case of normal diffusion is due to the arbitrarily long trajectories found in the infinite horizon billiard .",
    "these long flights occur in the channels between the scattering boundaries of the billiard .",
    "when a particle is traveling nearly parallel to the axis of the channel [ for figs .  [",

    "thus if @xmath56 is small , @xmath57 is also small , and both represent long flights .",
    "this suggests an extreme model for the particle transport in which the length of a flight for each particle does not change from reflection to reflection ; the length of each flight is completely correlated with the previous flight , but different particles have different flight lengths .      consider a one dimensional system in which an ensemble of particles executes a random walk .",

    "( [ eq : contributions ] ) yields    @xmath72    this simple toy model shows that it is the very long flights allowed by the open channels that give rise to the non - gaussian behavior for moments greater than 2 .",
    "one might then think that for the real billiard systems of fig .",
    "[ fig : examples ] the behavior for @xmath7 is a trivial result of the initial distribution of angles .",
    "however , this is not the case and the behavior ( [ eq : result ] ) is robust to changes in the initial distribution of particles . as discussed in sec .",
    "2c , non - uniform initial angular distributions scatter rapidly enough that ( [ eq : result ] ) still holds even if the initial distribution has no particles traveling nearly parallel to the channels .",
    "we now consider a uniform initial spatial ( within a cell ) and angular distribution and for the case of the ergodic billiards of figs .",
    "[ fig : examples](a ) ( sinai billiard ) and [ fig : examples](d ) ( scalloped billiard ) . in these cases",
    "such a distribution is stationary when @xmath73 is taken modulo the appropriate cell period .",
    "we show that @xmath3 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) for these real billiard systems",
    ". the particle transport in an infinite horizon billiard must proceed at least as quickly as a random walk process ( i.e. , as fast as normal diffusion ) .",
    "while there exist mechanisms for faster than diffusive transport ( to be discussed below ) , there is no stable mechanism to stop or trap a billiard particle .",
    "the periodic orbits that might trap the particle in these systems are all exponentially unstable . that a random walk is a lower bound on the transport in the billiard system implies that @xmath74 .",
    "in addition to diffusive like behavior , particle trajectories that consist of a single long flight ( `` ballistic '' flight ) also participate in particle transport .",
    "if every particle were to move ballistically , we would find @xmath75 .",
    "this provides an upper bound on @xmath3 ; not every particle will execute a single uninterrupted flight .",
    "we can , however , place a lower bound on the fraction of particle that do .",
    "since the distribution of particle velocities is uniform in orientation , the fraction of particles executing flights of distance @xmath76 or more ( where @xmath77 is the velocity of the particle ) involve a fraction of order of @xmath78 of the particles occupying a channel at any one time , where @xmath13 is the channel width defined in fig .",

    "there are two points that can be fixed on the graph of @xmath3 vs. @xmath16 .",
    "the first is the zeroth moment , which by the conservation of probability is identically equal to one .",

    "the second point is fixed by the diffusion coefficient , which relates the second moment to time .",
    "it has been found [ 14 ] that @xmath82 is of the order @xmath83 and so , consistent with the definition ( [ eq : shorthand ] ) , ignoring factors of @xmath2 we have @xmath84 .",
    "next we argue that @xmath3 is a concave up function of @xmath16 . invoking the cauchy - schwartz inequality @xmath85 , for @xmath86    @xmath87    thus    @xmath88    from ( [ eq : moment_intro ] ) ,",
    "( [ eq : shorthand ] ) , and ( [ eq : concavity_condition ] ) we have that the graph of @xmath3 versus @xmath16 is indeed concave up @xmath89    finally , we show that eq .",

    "we have given lower bounds on @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath74 and @xmath94 .",
    "we have also pinned the value of @xmath3 at two values : @xmath81 and @xmath95 .",
    "the first lower bound , the two known values of @xmath3 , and the concavity condition ( [ eq : gamma_condition ] ) force @xmath90 for @xmath91 .",
    "there is a trivial upper bound on @xmath3 , @xmath96 .",
    "this upper bound , along with eq .",
    "( [ eq : concavity_condition ] ) implies that the slope of @xmath3 never exceeds one . since @xmath95 , @xmath97 for @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath93 both the upper bound and the lower bound coincide resulting in @xmath92 for @xmath93 .      the discussions of the previous two subsections relied on the existence of a uniform distribution for @xmath50 in the particle ensemble .",
    "this applies if one starts with a distribution uniform in angle and uniform in the space within a cell , in which case the particle ensemble will retain the uniform angular distribution . on the other hand ,",
    "even if we have an initial distribution that is non - uniform , it will ( under very general conditions ) relax to the uniform distribution as time increases .",
    "the question we now address is whether this relaxation is fast enough to yield the same result for the temporal scaling of @xmath98 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : result ] ) , as the initially uniform distribution .    to consider this question , we first study the relaxation of an initial particle distribution with no particles in a finite gap around the channel direction .",
    "for example , for the scalloped channel we consider the case where the initial particle distribution is uniform in the space within a cell @xmath99 and    @xmath100    where @xmath31 is the angle of the particle velocity vector with the @xmath10-axis , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are constants , and @xmath103 is in @xmath99 .",

    "let @xmath110 where the spatial integral is over a channel . then , if we introduce the scaled variable @xmath41 , we find that , in all the cases we have tested , the angular distribution function @xmath111 approaches a stationary form .",
    "that is ,    @xmath112    we illustrate this with a numerical calculation on the scalloped billiard with @xmath12 arcs ( fig .",

    "[ fig : spread ] . in generating this figure",
    "we follow the evolution of a large number of orbits initialized according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : scallopedinit ] ) , and form the distribution @xmath111 using a histogram approximation . as shown , at successively larger @xmath17 the distribution approaches a time independent form @xmath40 where @xmath40 is zero for @xmath113 , and , as @xmath114 increases past @xmath115 , @xmath40 increases , asymptoting to a constant for large @xmath114 .    a similar numerical experiment for the sinai billiard ( fig .",
    "[ fig : examples](a ) ) yields the result in fig .",
    "[ fig : sinai ] . in this case the large time distribution assumes the form ,    @xmath116    where @xmath48 and @xmath117 are constants .",

    "we explain the reason for the result ( [ eq : ptilde ] ) and why it does not apply for the billiard of fig .",

    "@xmath120 and @xmath126 these particles experience flights of length @xmath127 .",
    "hence for @xmath128 these flights give a contribution to @xmath32 that is approximately @xmath129 .",
    "thus the lower bound ( [ eq : lower_bound ] ) still applies , and , by the reasoning in sec .  2b , we again obtain ( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "we note that the asymptotic time dependence @xmath40 with @xmath130 is marginal in the sense that , if the repopulation of an initially empty channel were slower ( in the sense below ) , then ( [ eq : gamma ] ) would not be recovered . in order to see this , consider the hypothetical case where an asymptotic distribution @xmath131 of the form in fig .",

    "a full treatment of the theory yielding @xmath40 in this case will be given elsewhere [ 13 ] ; in the present paper , we will limit our discussion to the basic reason for the difference between this case and the other cases .",
    "in particular , we discuss why , for this case , @xmath145 in a finite interval about zero , @xmath146 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : examples](d1 ) we see that after a long flight in the channel a particle will collide with the channel wall close to one of the cusp points where two arcs touch . for the case of @xmath12 arcs ,",
    "the tangent to such a section of the channel wall is nearly horizontal .",
    "thus , upon reflection @xmath147 will still be small .",
    "in fact as shown in [ 12 ] by consideration of the geometry , @xmath148 on the @xmath149st reflection can not change by more than a factor of 3 from @xmath150 ,    @xmath151    thus , if @xmath150 is small , @xmath148 is still relatively small . we can obtain the lower bound on @xmath114 by considering the most extreme case where @xmath152 always decreases by 3 on every bounce ,    @xmath153    @xmath154    where @xmath13 is the channel width defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : examples](d1 ) , @xmath77 is the particle velocity , and @xmath155 is the time of the @xmath51th reflection . multiplying ( [ eq : thetahat ] ) by ( [ eq : time ] ) we have    @xmath156    which , for large @xmath51 , asymptotes to the solution @xmath157",
    ". thus @xmath158 , which agrees with our numerical solution fig .",
    "[ fig : spread ] ( see also [ 13 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the case of the scalloped channel with @xmath12 arcs , in the other cases shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : examples ] , the scattering of a long flight upon reflection from a channel wall leads to a much more drastic change in the angle of a particle s velocity vector with respect to the channel axis .",
    "for example , for the case of the sinai billiard , the angular deflection is typically of order @xmath159 which , for small @xmath152 , is much larger than @xmath152 . for the case of the scalloped channel with arcs of less than @xmath12",
    ", a particle moving nearly parallel to a channel axis is scattered by an angle of order one .",
    "furthermore , after a large deflection , the orientation of the particle s velocity vector is rapidly randomized by a succession of many reflections which , since the particle is no longer in a long flight , can occur in a relatively short time .",
    "these considerations lead us to a model for the cases in figs .",
    "[ fig : examples](a)-[fig : examples](c ) and [ fig : examples](d2 ) in which we adopt the model hypothesis that , when a particle in a long flight suffers a collision with a billiard wall , the orientation of its velocity vector is randomly scattered with uniform probability density in @xmath160 $ ] .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , bleher [ 9 ] proved , up to some natural conjectures that `` for any periodic configuration of scatterers with an infinite horizon the limit in distribution @xmath179 exists and @xmath180 is a gaussian random variable . ''",

    "we take no issue with bleher s proof referred to above , but we emphasize its use of _ limit in distribution _ convergence .",
    "this kind of convergence is the least restrictive kind of convergence considered within the context of probability and statistics .",
    "a proof of convergence in distribution implies only the ability to calculate the expectation value of functions that remain bounded .",
    "the convergence required by a limit in distribution is only strong enough to allow calculation of the expectations of functions that remain bounded [ 10 ] .",
    "therefore the convergence of bleher s pdf is not strong enough to allow the moments of the distribution to be calculated . as a result of",
    "the strong weight @xmath183 puts on the tails of the distribution @xmath184 , two different distributions with the same limit in distribution can have very different moments .",
    "the fact that bleher is able to accurately ( according to our simulations ) calculate the second and lower moments of the displacement distribution suggests that his result can be strengthened to `` convergence in @xmath185 mean '' which is satisfied for a sequence @xmath186 if the expectation value of @xmath187 as @xmath188 .",
