    "the research of the ground - state wave function of closed - shell molecules follows well - established paths .",
    "the perturbative expansions from the mean - field hartree - fock single determinant usually converge and may be used as basic tools , especially when adopting a mono - electronic zero - order hamiltonian known as the mller - plesset hamiltonian.@xcite in this approach the wave function and the energy may be understood in terms of diagrams , which lead to the fundamental linked - cluster theorem.@xcite the understanding of the size - consistency problem led to the suggestion of the coupled cluster approximation,@xcite which is now considered as the standard and most efficient tool in the study of such systems in their ground state , especially in its ccsd(t ) version where linked corrections by triple excitations are added perturbatively.@xcite the situation is less evident when considering excited states , chemical reactions and molecular dissociations , since it then becomes impossible to find a relevant single determinant zero - order wave function .",
    "these situations exhibit an intrinsic multi - reference ( mr ) character .",
    "a generalized linked - cluster theorem has been established by brandow,@xcite which gives a basis to the understanding of the size - consistency problem in this context , but the conditions for establishing this theorem are severe .",
    "they require a complete active space ( cas ) model space and a mono - electronic zero - order hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , the corresponding quasi - degenerate perturbation theory ( qdpt ) expansion can not converge in most of the molecular mr situations@xcite .",
    "the research of theoretically satisfying ( size - consistent ) and numerically efficient mr treatments remains a very active field in quantum chemistry , as summarized in recent review articles concerning either perturbative@xcite or coupled - cluster@xcite methods .",
    "the present work concentrates on the search of a new mr perturbative approach at second order ( mrpt2 ) .",
    "of course , pragmatic proposals have been rapidly formulated , consisting first in the identification of a reference model space , defined on the set of single determinants having large components in the desired eigenstates of the problem .",
    "diagonalizing the hamiltonian in this reference space delivers a zero - order wave function .",
    "then one must define the vectors of the outer space to be used in the development and , in a perturbative context , choose a zero - order hamiltonian .",
    "the simplest approach consists in using single determinants as outer - space eigenvectors , and this has been used in the cipsi method@xcite which is iterative , increasing the model space from the selection of the perturbing determinant of largest coefficients and their addition to the model space . from a practical point of view",
    "this method is very efficient and is now employed to reach near exact full configuration interaction ( fci ) energies on small molecules,@xcite and also as trial wave function in the context of quantum monte carlo.@xcite but the method suffers two main defects : i ) it is not size - consistent and ii ) it does not revise the model - space component of the wave function under the effect of its interaction with the outer - space . this last defect is avoided if one expresses the effect of the perturbation as a change of the matrix elements of the model space ci matrix , according to the intermediate effective hamiltonian ( ieh ) theory,@xcite as done in the state - specific@xcite or multi - state@xcite versions .",
    "other methods which start from a cas model space and use multi - determinantal outer - space vectors have been proposed later on and are now broadly used .",
    "the first one is the caspt2 method,@xcite which employs a mono - electronic zero - order hamiltonian .",
    "the method suffers from intruder state problems , to be cured in a pragmatic manner through the introduction of some parameters , and is not strictly size - consistent .",
    "the nevpt2 method@xcite also uses multi - determinantal perturbers ( defined in two different ways in its partially and strongly contracted versions ) , it makes use of a more sophisticated bi - electronic hamiltonian ( the dyall hamiltonian@xcite ) to define the zero - order energies of these perturbers , it is parameter - free , intruder - state free , and size - consistent .",
    "both methods are implemented in several popular codes , and use a contracted description of the model space component of the desired eigenfunction ( fixed by the diagonalization of the hamiltonian in the model space ) .",
    "multi - state versions exist to give some flexibility to the model space component , in particular around weakly avoided crossings , but this flexibility is very limited@xcite .",
    "if one returns to methods using single - determinant perturbers , the origin of their size - inconsistency problem has been identified as due to the unbalance between the multi - determinant character of the zero - order wave function and the single determinant character of the perturbers.@xcite it is in principle possible to find size consistent formulations but they require rather complex formulations,@xcite and face some risk of numerical instabilities since they involve divisions by possibly small coefficients , the amplitudes of which may be small . finally , one should mention a very recent approach based on the rewriting of the multi - reference linear coupled cluster equations in a stochastic framework of full - ci quantum monte carlo which also uses single slater determinants as perturbers@xcite .",
    "the present paper is composed as follows . in section",
    "[ theory ] , the here - proposed formalism is presented , whose main features are :    1 .",
    "it considers a cas model space ( to achieve the strict separability requirement ) , usually obtained from a preliminary casscf calculation ; 2 .",
    "the perturbers are single determinants ( the method is externally non - contracted , according to the usual terminology ) ; 3 .",
    "it is state - specific , and strictly separable when localized active mos are used ( see formal demonstration in the appendix ) ; 4 .",
    "it makes use of the dyall hamiltonian to define the excitation energies appearing in the energy denominators ; 5 .",
    "it is based on a jeziorski - monkhorst@xcite ( jm ) expression of the wave operator and proceeds through reference - specific partitionings of the zero - order hamiltonian , as it has been previously suggested in the so - called multi - partitionning@xcite ( mupa ) and also in the uga - ssmprt2.@xcite consequently , it does not define a unique zero - order energy to the outer - space determinants ; 6 .",
    "it can be expressed either as a second - order energy correction or as a dressing of the cas - ci matrix , which offers a full flexibility in the treatment of the feed - back effect of the post - cas - ci correlation on the model space component of the wave function ; 7 .",
    "the contributions of the various classes of excitations are easily identified ( as in the caspt2 and nevpt2 methods ) ; 8 .",
    "thanks to our definition of the zeroth - order energies , all processes involving double excitations can be treated by using only the one- and two - boy density matrices , avoiding to loop on the perturbers ; 9 .   given a set of molecular orbitals ,",
    "it is parameter free and does not contain any threshold to avoid numerical instabilities .",
    "after having presented the working equations of the present formalism , section [ comparison ] proposes a comparison with other existing mr approaches , such as some special cases of multi - reference coupled cluster ( mrcc ) and mrpt2 . then , section [ results ] presents the numerical results for the ground state potential energy curves of six molecules involving single , double and triple bond breaking with both the jm - mrpt2 and jm - heffpt2 methods .",
    "a numerical test of size - extensivity is provided , together with the investigation of the dependency of the results on the locality of the active orbitals .",
    "finally , section [ concl ] summarizes the main results and presents its tentative developments .",
    "the reader can find in the section [ annex ] a mathematical proof of strong separability of the jm - mrpt2 method .",
    "and @xmath0 , just as the two perturbers determinants generated by the same excitation operator @xmath1 on the two cas determinants . ]",
    "as demonstrated previously by one of the present authors and his collaborators,@xcite the size - consistency problem in any multi - reference perturbative expansion using single slater determinants as perturbers comes from the unbalanced zeroth order energies that occur in the denominators .",
    "more precisely , if the zeroth order wave function is a cas - ci eigenvector , its energy is stabilized by all the interactions within the active space , whereas a perturber treated as a single slater determinant does not benefit from these extra - diagonal hamiltonian matrix elements . however ,",
    "if one considers the set of perturber determinants created by the application of a given excitation operator on all slater determinants of the cas - ci wave function , most of the interactions found within the active space will occur within this set of perturbers ( see figure [ cas ] for a pictorial example ) .",
    "therefore , the use of linear combinations of slater determinants as perturbers together with a bi - electronic zeroth order operator , as it is the case in the nevpt2 framework which uses the dyall zeroth order operator , leads to balanced energy differences and removes the size - consistency problem .",
    "on the basis of such considerations , the present work proposes an approach that uses single slater determinants as perturbers and takes benefits of a new definition of energy denominators as expectation values of the dyall zeroth order hamiltonian over a specific class of linear combinations of slater determinants .",
    "we first expose the definition of this perturbation theory , namely the jm - mrpt2 , which is strictly separable provided that local orbitals are used .",
    "a large benefit from this new definition is that one may go beyond the sole calculation of the energy and improve the reference wave function by taking into account , in a strictly size - consistent way , the correlation effects brought by the perturbers on the reference space . in a second step , we reformulate the approach as a dressing of the hamiltonian matrix within the set of slater determinants belonging to the reference wave function , which is diagonalized .",
    "this approach will be referred to as the jm - heffpt2 method .",
    "the formalism presented here is state specific and is not therefore restricted to ground state calculations .",
    "nevertheless , for the sake of clarity and compactness , we omit the index referring explicitly to a specific eigenstate .",
    "the zeroth order wave function @xmath2 is assumed to be a cas - ci eigenvector expanded on the set of reference determinants @xmath3 : @xmath4 such a wave function has a variational energy @xmath5 : @xmath6 starting from a normalized @xmath2 ( i.e. @xmath7 ) , we assume that the exact wave function can be expressed as : @xmath8 where here the @xmath9 are all possible slater determinants not belonging to the cas - ci space . one should notice that such form is in principle not exact , as some changes of the coefficients within the cas - ci space can formally occur when passing from the cas - ci eigenvector to the fci one , but such an approximated form for the exact wave function is the basis of many mrpt2 approaches like nevpt2 , caspt2 or cipsi .",
    "as in any projection technique , the exact energy can be obtained by projecting the schrdinger equation on @xmath2 : @xmath10 and one only needs to compute the coefficients of the @xmath9 that interact with @xmath2 , which consist in all individual slater determinants being singly or doubly excited with respect to any slater determinant in the cas - ci space . from now on we implicitly refer to @xmath9 as any single slater determinant belonging to such a space .",
    "the coefficients @xmath11 are then written according to the jm ansatz@xcite , whose general expression for wave function is not explicitly needed here , and will be therefore given in the section [ linkmrcc ] when the comparison of the present method with other multi - reference methodologies will be investigated .",
    "the jm ansatz introduces the genealogy of the coefficients @xmath11 with respect to the slater determinants within the cas - ci space : @xmath12 where the quantity @xmath13 is the excitation amplitude related to the excitation process @xmath14 that leads from @xmath3 to @xmath15 : @xmath16 here , we restrict @xmath17 to be a single or double excitation operator . within this jm formulation of @xmath11 , a very general first order approximation of the amplitudes @xmath18",
    "can be expressed as : @xmath19 where the excitation energy @xmath20 depends explicitly of the couple @xmath21 .",
    "such a definition is different from other determinant - based mrpt2 like the cipsi or shifted-@xmath22 where the excitation energy does not depend on the couple @xmath21 but only on the @xmath9 . with this definition of @xmath18 ,",
    "one can write the second - order correction to the energy @xmath23 as : @xmath24 and the total second - order energy @xmath25 : @xmath26      the first - order wave function can be written explicitly in terms of the excitation operators @xmath14 : @xmath27 however , one can notice that    1 .   the excitation operators @xmath14 do not explicitly depend on @xmath3 as they are general single or double excitation operators , just as in the hamiltonian for instance ; 2 .",
    "a given excitation operator @xmath28 contributes to the coefficients of several @xmath9 ( @xmath14 = @xmath29 = @xmath28 ) ; 3 .",
    "the application of all the single and double excitation operators @xmath28 on each @xmath3 generates the entire set of @xmath9 as the reference is a cas .    therefore one can rewrite the first - order perturbed wave function directly in term of excitation operators @xmath28 applied on the each cas - ci slater determinant as : @xmath30 where the @xmath31 is the part of the first - order wave function associated with the excitation process",
    "@xmath28 : @xmath32    in order to fully define our perturbation theory and intermediate hamiltonian theory , one needs to select an expression for the energy denominators occurring in the definition of @xmath31 .",
    "we propose to take a quantity that does not depend explicitly on the reference determinant @xmath3 but only depends on the excitation process @xmath28 : @xmath33 consequently , in the expression of @xmath31 ( see eq .  ) , the energy denominator can be factorized : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is simply : @xmath36 also , one can notice that , as @xmath35 and @xmath31 differ by a simple constant factor , they have the same normalized expectation values : @xmath37 then , the excitation energy @xmath38 is simply taken as the difference of the normalized expectation values of the dyall hamiltonian @xmath39 over @xmath2 and @xmath40 : @xmath41 this ensures the strong separability when localized orbitals are used , as will be illustrated numerically in the section [ results ] .",
    "the dyall hamiltonian is nothing but the exact hamiltonian over the active orbitals , and a mller - plesset type operator over the doubly occupied and virtual orbitals .",
    "if one labels @xmath42 the active spin - orbitals , @xmath43 the spin - orbitals that are always occupied and @xmath44 the virtual spin - orbitals , the dyall hamiltonian can be written explicitly as : @xmath45 @xmath46 where the @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined as the spin - orbital energies associated with the density given by @xmath2 , and the effective active one - electron operator @xmath49 . with a proper choice of the constant @xmath50 in eq .",
    ", @xmath51 one has : @xmath52 because the dyall hamiltonian acts differently on the active and inactive - virtual orbitals , the excitation energy @xmath53 is the sum of an excitation energy @xmath54 associated with the inactive and virtual orbitals and of an excitation energy @xmath55 associated with the active orbitals : @xmath56 also , it is useful to differentiate the active part from the inactive - virtual part of the excitation @xmath28 : @xmath57 the inactive - virtual excitation energy @xmath54 is simply : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 refer to , respectively , the inactive and virtual spin - orbitals involved in the excitation operator @xmath28 .",
    "conversely , the active excitation energy @xmath61 has a more complex expression , namely :    @xmath62      from eq .",
    ", one must differentiate the class of the pure single excitation operators from the pure double excitation operators . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we define the spin - adapted bielectronic integrals @xmath63 as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the spin variable of the spin orbitals @xmath66 and @xmath67 . if one considers a given double excitation involving four different spin orbitals @xmath66 , @xmath68 , @xmath67 and @xmath69 : @xmath70 one can notice that the hamiltonian matrix elements associated with this double excitation only depend , up to a phase factor , on the four indices @xmath71 involved in the @xmath72 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath72 is possible on both @xmath3 and @xmath73 , one has : @xmath74 and as @xmath75 it becomes : @xmath76 therefore , as the hamiltonian matrix elements of type @xmath77 can be factorized both in the numerator and the dominator of the expression of the active part of the excitation energy ( see eq . ) . finally , the expression of the active part of the excitation energy for a given double excitation @xmath72 is simply : @xmath78 as a consequence , the amplitudes @xmath79 and @xmath80 associated with the same excitation @xmath81 for different parents @xmath3 and @xmath73 are also equal : @xmath82 and one can define a unique excitation operator @xmath83 which does not depend on the reference determinant on which it acts .",

    ".   can not be simplified .      as the formalism proposed here deals with slater determinants",
    ", it can not formally ensure to provide spin eigenfunctions . in order to ensure the invariance of the energy with the @xmath86 value of a given spin multiplicity",
    ", we introduced a slightly modified version of the dyall hamiltonian which does not consider :    1 .",
    "any exchange terms in the hamiltonian matrix elements when active orbitals are involved 2 .",
    "any exchange terms involving two electrons of opposite spins ( namely @xmath87 and @xmath88 )      an advantage of a determinant - based multi - reference perturbation theory is that it can be easily written as a dressing of the hamiltonian matrix within the reference space .",
    "starting from the schrdinger equation projected on a given reference determinant @xmath3 one has : @xmath89 using the expression for the first order coefficients @xmath90 , it becomes : @xmath91 therefore , one can define an non - hermitian operator @xmath92 : @xmath93 and a dressed hamiltonian @xmath94 as : @xmath95 such that eq .",

    "it is interesting to understand the similarities and differences between the present jm - mprt2 and other strictly size - consistent mrpt2 methods , like the nevpt2 and specially its strongly contracted variant ( sc - nevpt2 ) .",
    "the first important similarity is that both the jm - mrpt2 and the nevpt2 methods use the dyall hamiltonian .",
    "then , the jm - mrpt2 uses perturbers that are individual slater determinants , whereas the nevpt2 uses linear combinations of slater determinants .",
    "however , in the sc - nevpt2 , the contraction coefficients are closely related to the hamiltonian matrix elements , just as in the jm - mrpt2 method . in order to better understand the differences between the sc - nevpt2 and jm - mrpt2 ,",
    "let us take a practical example . here , @xmath103 are inactive spin - orbitals , @xmath104 are active spin - orbitals and @xmath105 are virtual spin - orbitals . considering a given semi - active double excitation @xmath106 ,",

    ": @xmath111 note that such a quantity can be thought as an approximation of the electron affinity of the molecule , as it is the change in energy when one introduces `` brutally '' an electron in spin orbital @xmath112 without relaxing the wave function .",
    "consequently , as it has been emphasized in section [ linkmrcc ] , one can consider the part of the first - order perturbed wave function generated by the excitation @xmath108 : @xmath113 which turns out to be : @xmath114 in the sc - nevpt2 framework , one does not consider explicitly a given @xmath108 but has to consider a unique excitation @xmath115 which is a linear combination of all possible @xmath108 for all active spin orbitals @xmath112 , with proper contraction coefficients . to be more precise ,",
    "the first - order perturbed wave function associated with @xmath115 is : @xmath116 where the excitation energy @xmath117 associated with @xmath115 is unique for all the excitation operators @xmath108 , and can be thought as an average excitation energy over all @xmath112 .",
    "consequently , one can express the part of @xmath118 that comes from the @xmath108 as : @xmath119 which we can compare to eq .   in the case of the jm - mrpt2 method .",
    "then , the only difference between the sc - nevpt2 and the jm - mrpt2 is the definition of the excitation energy occurring in eqs .   and  .",
    "in the sc - nevpt2 method , the excitation energy @xmath117 is closely related to the excitation energy defined in jm - mrpt2 : @xmath120 where the quantity @xmath121 is the same for all active orbitals and defined as :    @xmath122    under this perspective , one sees that the quantity @xmath121 is related to @xmath110 defined in eq .  :    * in the jm - mrpt2 method , the quantity @xmath110 explicitly refers to the `` brutal '' addition of en electron in orbital @xmath112 , whatever the inactive orbitals @xmath103 or virtual orbitals @xmath123 involved in @xmath108 ; * the quantity @xmath121 involved in the sc - nevpt2 is an average electronic affinity over all possible excitation processes @xmath124 within the active space , but keeping a trace of the inactive and virtual excitation processes involved in @xmath108 thanks to the interaction @xmath125 .",
    "consequently , the quantity @xmath121 contains also the interactions between the various @xmath126 . to summarize , on one hand , the jm - mrpt2 gives a different but rather crude excitation energy for each @xmath108 , and on the other hand the sc - nevpt2 has a unique and sophisticated excitation energy for all @xmath108",
    "of course , one can extend this comparison to all the other classes of double excitations .",
    "the present formalism has also several links with other multi - reference methods .",
    "first of all , as it uses a jm genealogical definition for the coefficients @xmath90 ( see eqs .   and  ) , the wave function corrected at first order @xmath127 can be written as : @xmath128 by introducing the excitation operator @xmath129 acting only on @xmath3 as : @xmath130 the expression of @xmath127 in eq",
    ".   becomes : @xmath131 such a parameterization for the first - order corrected wave function @xmath132 recalls immediately a first - order taylor expansion of the general jm - mrcc ansatz : @xmath133 also , within the present formalism , the class of the double excitations can be factorized as shown in the previous section .",
    "therefore , using the reference - independent amplitudes defined in eq .",
    "one can define a unique double excitation operator @xmath134 as : @xmath135 recalling thus the formalism of the internally - contracted - mrcc@xcite ( ic - mrcc ) which uses a unique excitation operator @xmath136 as in the single - reference coupled - cluster : @xmath137 however , unlike the ic - mrcc formalism , the jm - mrpt2 equations do not suffer from the linear dependency problems.@xcite in such a perspective , as the energy provided by the jm - mrpt2 equations is size - extensive , it can be seen as a linearized coupled cluster version using a hybrid parameterization of the wave function : internally contracted ansatz for the double excitation operators and jm ansatz for the single excitation operators .",
    "the jm - mrpt2 presented here can be directly compared to the cipsi method , just as the jm - heffpt2 can be directly compared to the shifted-@xmath22 method . indeed , by using the following amplitudes : @xmath138 in the equation of the second - order correction on the energy ( see eq .",
    ") , one obtains the cipsi energy , and by introducing @xmath139 in the definition of the dressed hamiltonian @xmath98 , one obtains the shifted-@xmath22 energy . as mentioned previously , it has been shown that the size - consistency error of these methods comes from the unbalanced treatment between the variational energy of a multi - reference wave function such as @xmath2 and the variational energy of the single slater determinant @xmath9 .",
    "such an error is not present within the definitions of the excitation energies in the jm - mrpt2 method as the latter introduces expectation values of the hamiltonian over linear combinations of perturber slater determinants .    in a similar context",
    ", one can compare the jm - heffpt2 method to the split - gas@xcite of li manni _ et al _ whose definition of the amplitude is : @xmath140 in the split - gas framework , the correlation energy @xmath23 brought by the perturbers is included in the energy denominator , which introduces self consistent equations as in the brillouin - wigner perturbation theory.@xcite however , the size - consistency error in such a method is even more severe than in the shifted-@xmath22 as the excitation energies are much larger due to the presence of the total correlation energy @xmath23 .",
    "compared to other size - extensive mrpt2 methods , a clear advantage of the jm - mrpt2 is its simplicity . the nevpt2 approach requires to handle the four - body density matrix and the caspt2 needs to handle the three - body density matrix .",
    "both of these computationally intensive phases can be skipped in our formalism as one only needs to compute expectation values whose number are relatively small compared to nevpt2 and caspt2 .",
    "the most involved quantity to be computed is @xmath141 for all pairs @xmath142 where @xmath143 is an inactive orbital and @xmath144 is a virtual orbital .",
    "these quantities need to be only computed once since they can all fit in memory .",
    "each @xmath145 is , from the computational point of view , equivalent to an expectation value over the casscf wave function .",
    "as all the @xmath145 are independent , the computation of these quantities can be trivially parallelized .",

    ", what differentiates the effective fock operator between two different determinants @xmath3 and @xmath73 is the active part : @xmath184 one can then notice that the active part of the fock operator @xmath185 is just a sum over all active orbitals occupied in @xmath3 of quantities that only depend on the active orbitals : @xmath186 where @xmath187 is nothing but : @xmath188 therefore , by computing and storing all possible @xmath187 together with @xmath189 , one can then easily rebuild the total effective operator of a given slater determinant @xmath3 : @xmath190 and consequently compute the total second - order correction to the energy @xmath191 as a simple expectation value . to summarize , a computational step scaling as @xmath192 ( see eq .",

    "the relative error remains in the same order of magnitude than the for the casscf .",
    "this shows that no non - separability error was introduced in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "finally , one should notice the strong non - separability error of the shifted-@xmath22 approach .",
    "the present work has presented a new mrpt2 approach , the jm - mrpt2 method , that uses individual slater determinants as perturbers and allows for an intermediate hamiltonian formulation , which is the jm - heffpt2 approach .",
    "these methods are strictly size - consistent when localized orbitals are used , as has been numerically illustrated here .",
    "the link of these two new methods with other existing multi - reference theories has been established , specially in the case of the sc - nevpt2 level of theory .",
    "the accuracy of the methods has been investigated on a series of ground state potential energy curves up to the full dissociation limit for a set of six molecules involving single ( f@xmath195 , fh , c@xmath195h@xmath196 ) , double ( h@xmath195o , c@xmath195h@xmath197 ) and triple bond breaking ( n@xmath195 ) , using the cc - pvdz basis set and the aug - cc - pvdz basis set in the case of fh .",
    "the two methods proposed here have been compared to near fci energies thanks to large cipsi calculations converged bellow 0.1  mh , whose values can be found in the supporting information file .",
    "the quality of the results has been investigated by means of the non - parallelism error and three spectroscopic constants ( @xmath200 , @xmath201 and @xmath202 ) together with absolute errors with respect to fci energies along the whole potential energy curves . among the six molecules studied here , the largest error found on the binding energy at the jm - mrpt2 level of theory",
    "is of 6  mh for the fh molecule , representing a deviation lower than 3@xmath203 with respect to the fci value . in all other cases ,",
    "the errors on @xmath201 are much smaller , ranging from 1.3  mh to 2.5  mh , which represents deviations between 1@xmath203 and 3@xmath203 with respect to the fci estimates .",
    "the equilibrium distance is also found to be always within @xmath204 of the fci values .",
    "these results are very encouraging , specially considering the simplicity of this second - order perturbation theory , and its low computational cost .",
    "regarding the jm - heffpt2 method , its intermediate hamiltonian formulation allows to take into account the dominant part of the coupling between the static and dynamic correlation effects . from what has been observed in the present calculations ,",
    "the diagonalization of the symmetrized intermediate hamiltonian yields improved ci - coefficients on the reference determinants , together with a very small npe compared to the shifted-@xmath22 method .      due to its flexibility",
    ", the present formalism offers a broad field of perspectives .",
    "first , the jm - mrpt2 and jm - heffpt2 methods can be formalized with a zeroth order wave function that does not need to be a cas - ci eigenvector .",
    "this opens the way of treating much larger active spaces as one can select the dominant configurations of a given cas - ci space thanks to the use of a perturbative criterion ( as in the cipsi algorithm ) or by using localized orbitals .",
    "second , the reasons of the systematic slight overestimation of the binding energy at the jm - mrpt2 level of theory can also be investigated , taking benefit from localized active orbitals and of the clear reading of the reference wave function that they offer . moreover , this allows one to use as zeroth - order wave function quasi diabatic states obtained , for instance , by a unitary transformation of a few ci eigenvectors@xcite ( either of a cas - ci or from a more general ci ) also , as it has been shown that the present formulation is connected to multi - reference coupled - cluster formalisms , it is possible to derive the working equations starting from the jm - mrcc ansatz . this will allow to obtain higher order terms which may correct the slight overestimation of the binding energies .",
    "the coupling of the present formalism with multi - reference coupled cluster models follows naturally .",
    "for instance , the treatment of the most numerous excitation classes at the jm - mrpt2 level can easily be combined with the recently introduced jm - mrcc ansatz of some of the present authors.@xcite this will allow for a drastic lowering of the computational costs of the jm - mrcc ansatz , and opens the way to the treatment of larger systems at high level of _ ab initio _ theory .    _ acknowledgments . _",

    "the present section proposes an analytical proof of strong separability of the jm - mrpt2 method . in a mrpt2 framework",
    ", the strong separability requires that an excitation @xmath205 located on a system @xmath206 gives the same contribution to the correlation energy with or without the presence of another system @xmath207 whose zeroth - order wave function contains correlation effects . to be more specific ,",
    "let us define the zeroth - order wave function and energy of a system @xmath206 : @xmath208 @xmath209 and the same quantities for the system @xmath207 : @xmath210 @xmath211 let us consider now a given excitation @xmath205 acting only on a system @xmath206 . according to the definition of eq .",
    ", the corresponding contribution to the first - order perturbed wave function is : @xmath212 @xmath213 and the excitation energy @xmath214 characteristic of the excitation @xmath205 is defined according to eq .   as : @xmath215 therefore",
    ", its contribution to the correlation energy of @xmath206 is : @xmath216 the strong separability property will be respected if the contribution to the correlation energy @xmath217 of @xmath205 in the case of the super - system non interacting @xmath218 is strictly equal to @xmath219 . in such a case , the zeroth - order wave function must be the product of the zeroth - order wave function of the two sub - systems @xmath206 and @xmath207 : @xmath220 which ensures that its corresponding zeroth - order energy is the sum of zeroth - order energies of the sub - systems @xmath206 and @xmath207 : @xmath221 as the total hamiltonian can be written as the sum of @xmath222 acting only on the orbitals of @xmath206 and the corresponding @xmath223 acting only on the orbitals of @xmath207 .",
    "a cas - ci wave function respects of course such a property .",
    "starting from @xmath224 , one can generate the contribution to the first - order perturbed wave function @xmath225 associated with @xmath205 in the super - system @xmath218 : @xmath226 @xmath227 with the following excitation energy @xmath228 : @xmath229 then , the contribution of @xmath205 to the correlation energy of the super system @xmath218 is simply : @xmath230 one can then notice that , as @xmath205 only acts on the orbitals of @xmath206 , one has : @xmath231 and consequently the zeroth - order can be factorized in the eq .",
    ": @xmath232 this form for the @xmath233 is crucial , as it has a product structure , implying that it will not suffer from any size consistency and separability issues .",
    "indeed , the numerator of eq .   simply reduces to : @xmath234 and the denominator of the same equation   is then : @xmath235 and therefore , @xmath236 consequently , the jm - mrpt2 is strictly separable provided that a partition of the hamiltonian in terms of @xmath222 and @xmath223 can be done , which supposes local orbitals .",
