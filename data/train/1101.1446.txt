    "ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs ) are variable off - nuclear x - ray sources with luminosities exceeding the eddington luminosity of a @xmath4 compact object , assuming isotropic emission @xcite . irregular variability , on time scales from seconds to years , suggests that ulxs contain accreting compact objects .",
    "intermediate mass black holes would be required to produce the inferred luminosities , but ulxs may , instead , accrete at super eddington rates or be beamed , mechanically or relativistically .",
    "ngc 5408 x-1 is one of the best intermediate mass black hole candidates because it powers a radio nebula requiring an extremely energetic outflow @xcite and a photoionized nebula requiring an x - ray luminosity above @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "also , quasi - periodic x - ray oscillations at low frequencies suggest a high compact object mass @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart to ngc 5408 x-1 was identified by @xcite and optical spectra were obtained by @xcite .",
    "the optical spectra had no absorption lines suggesting the emission is not dominated by the companion star .",
    "the observed continuum emission may arise from a nebula or reprocessing of x - rays in an accretion disk .",
    "the optical spectrum is dominated by emission lines , including forbidden lines which must be produced in a low density environment such as a nebula .",
    "several high excitation lines were detected indicating that the nebula is x - ray photoionized .",
    "@xcite found that the heii line from ngc 5408 x-1 was broader than the forbidden lines .",
    "permitted lines produced in the high - density environment of an accretion disk can be broad , reflecting the distribution of velocities within the optical emitting regions of the disk .",
    "furthermore , since the accretion disk moves with the compact object , the line velocity shifts may provide a means to constrain the compact object mass @xcite .    to study the heii line profile of ngc 5408 x-1 in more detail",
    ", we obtained new observations using the fors-2 spectrograph on the european southern observatory very large telescope ( vlt ) with a high resolution grism and reanalyzed our previous fors-1 observations @xcite . the observations and data reduction",
    "are described in  2 .",
    "the results are presented in  3 and discussed in  4 .",
    "fors-2 observations of ngc 5408 x-1 were obtained on 12 april 2010 using the gris_1200b and gris_1200r grisms with a slit width of @xmath6 covering the spectral range 3660@xmath75110   and 5750@xmath77310   with dispersion 0.36   pixel@xmath8 and 0.38   pixel@xmath8 and spectral resolution @xmath9 and @xmath10 at the central wavelength , respectively . the observation block ( ob ) consisted of three 849  s exposures with a 12 pixel offset along the spatial axis between successive exposures .",
    "ccd pixels were binned for readout by 2 in both the spatial and spectral dimensions .",
    "we also reanalyzed all six obs of the previous fors-1 observations @xcite , hereafter the low resolution data ( lrd ) , taken using the gris_600b grism which has a spectral resolution of @xmath11 at the central wavelength and with three shifted exposures per ob .",
    "the average seeing for our new observations was 0.72 and 0.62 arcsecond for the blue and red spectra , respectively .",
    "the average seeing of the six obs of the lrd were 0.87 , 0.82 , 0.96 , 1.28 , 0.64 , 0.57 arcsecond , respectively .",
    "data reduction was carried out using the image reduction and analysis facility ( iraf ) @xcite .",
    "first , we created bias and flat - field images , then applied these to correct the spectrum images .",
    "the three exposures in each ob were aligned then averaged to eliminate bad pixels and cosmic rays using the imcombine task with the ccdclip rejection algorithm .",
    "as the continuum emission of the ulx counterpart is faint , we could not trace its spectrum .",
    "following @xcite , we used the bright nearby star at 2mass @xcite position @xmath12 as a reference trace .",
    "the trace position on the spatial axis varied less than half a pixel along the whole length of the dispersion axis .",
    "the trace for the ulx counterpart was centered on the heii @xmath13 emission line profile .",
    "the smallest possible trace width , 2 pixels corresponding to @xmath14 , was used to best isolate the ulx emission from the nebular emission .",
    "background subtraction was done with a trace close by . the hgcdhenea lamp and standard star ltt7379",
    "were used for wavelength and flux calibration .",
    "an atmospheric extinction correction was applied using the iraf built - in cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) extinction tables . to estimate the reddening",
    ", we used the balmer decrement of h@xmath15/h@xmath1 , we find @xmath16 in agreement with @xcite . we corrected for reddening using the extinction curve from @xcite with @xmath17 .    to study the kinematics , we need to characterize the instrumental resolution in order to obtain intrinsic line widths . after applying the dispersion correction to the lamp spectrum",
    ", we measured the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of several lines , excluding saturated ones , by fitting gaussians with the iraf splot subroutine .",
    "the instrumental fwhm was 2.24 and 5.08 for the high and low resolution data , respectively .",
    "the error on the instrumental fhwm was estimated by finding the standard deviation of the fwhm for several different lines .",
    "for the heii , h@xmath1 and [ oiii ] emission lines , see fig .  1 . and table  [ fit ] , we first fitted the continuum with a second order polynomial to a region around each line excluding the line itself by visual examination .",
    "we estimated the measurement errors by calculating the root mean square deviation of the data in the same region .",
    "then , we performed a non - linear least squares fit using the lmfit subroutine of the interactive data language version 7.0 and based on `` mrqmin '' @xcite .",
    "we fitted the line profiles iteratively , first using one gaussian which converged on the narrow component , then using a sum of two gaussians with initial parameters adjusted to achieve convergence .",
    "all six parameters in the two gaussian fit were free to vary .",
    "the errors on the parameters were calculated by the fitting routine in a way that the uncertainty for the @xmath18th parameter derives from the square - root of the corresponding diagonal element of the covariance matrix .",
    "the intrinsic line width was calculated assuming the measured line width is the quadrature sum of the intrinsic and instrumental widths and the error on the intrinsic line width included a term for the uncertainty in the instrumental fhwm .    for the h@xmath19 line , we fitted the sum of four gaussians , because the [ nii ] lines lie on the red and blue parts of the line wing .",
    "initial fits to the h@xmath19 and red [ nii ] lines provided initial values for a fit with four gaussians . because the blue [ nii ] line has very low signal to noise ratio , the widths of the two [ nii ] lines were set equal , the wavelength offset was fixed at @xmath20   , and the amplitude of the blue line",
    "was set to 1/3 of the red line @xcite .",

    "we did fit the h@xmath19 line in the new data . although we do not obtain a good fit ( @xmath35 ) because of the complicated line profile ( i.e.  the two [ nii ] lines lie on the red and blue wing of the h@xmath19 line ) , we find that there is a broad component with a width of 19  , while the width of the nebular component is 2.7   .",
    "the [ nii ] lines are narrow , with a typical width of 3  , quantitatively supporting that the forbidden , nebular lines do not have broad components .",
    "our new , high - resolution spectra show narrow nebular lines and broad components in the heii , h@xmath1 , and h@xmath19 lines . our previous , moderate - resolution spectra show a broad component in the heii line .",
    "there is no broad component in the [ o iii ] nebular lines in either the new or old spectra .",
    "there is still no sign of any absorption lines in the new spectra .",
    "the broad components of both heii and h@xmath1 have widths @xmath0750 km / s , consistent with production in the accretion disk , and are roughly gaussian , instead of having p - cygni profiles that would indicate origin in a wind .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the size of the line - emitting region , @xmath36 , by assuming the line - emitting gas is in keplerian orbits around a compact object , thus @xmath37 . we find @xmath38  au , which for a mass of 10 m@xmath3 would give an upper limit of 3.4 r@xmath3 .",
    "this is consistent with origin of the broad heii line in the accretion disk .",
    "the broad line components are shifted relative to the narrow components . in the new data ,",
    "the shifts are small compared to the line width , @xmath39  km / s for heii and @xmath40  km / s for h@xmath1 .",
    "these shifts are consistent only at the @xmath41 level , which might indicate a difference in the spatial origin of the lines .",
    "however , this is still consistent with production of both lines within the disk since random motions within the disk and variation between the emission regions could produce shifts that are small compared to the line widths , as observed .    the central wavelength of the heii broad component shifts markedly between the odld and new data , @xmath34 @xmath30 or @xmath42  km / s .",
    "this shift is a substantial fraction of the line width .",
    "the shift could be due to random motion within the disk , differing viewing geometries @xcite , or orbital motion of disk ( and the compact object ) .",
    "if the shifts in the broad component of the heii line are due to orbital motion , then this would provide a means to determine the orbital period and would also provide a measurement of the mass function for the secondary star .",
    "thus , a program of monitoring ngc 5408 x-1 with high - resolution optical spectroscopic observations will be important in extending our understanding of the physical nature of this system .      in this section",
    ", we make some speculations based on interpretation of the shift in the broad component of the heii line as due to orbital motion .",
    "one can express the mass function and the compact object mass , @xmath43 , in terms of the orbital period , @xmath44 , the velocity excursion , @xmath45 , and the companion mass , @xmath46 , as      [ binary ]   donor and the lower line is for a 20  m@xmath3 donor ( left vertical scale ) .",
    "the orbital separation is shown as dotted lines with values read on the right vertical scale ; the upper line for an 120  m@xmath3 and the lower is for 20  m@xmath3 donor ( right vertical scale ) .",
    "the two dashed lines show the upper limit on the size of the line - emitting region ; the upper line is for an 120  m@xmath3 donor and the lower line is for a 20  m@xmath3 donor ( right vertical scale ) .",
    "the intercept of the dotted and dashed lines provides a limit on the period and consequently on the mass of the black hole.,title=\"fig:\",width=336 ]      where @xmath18 is the inclination angle and @xmath49 is the gravitational constant . from the shift of the heii line quoted above , we constrain the semi - amplitude of the radial velocity @xmath50  km / s .",
    "thus , if the maximum mass of the companion and the orbital period are known , then eq .  2 leads to an upper bound on the mass of the compact object .",
    "the binary system has a visual magnitude @xmath51 that gives an upper limit on the absolute magnitude of the companion of @xmath52 at a distance of 4.8 mpc @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this places little restriction on the companion mass as even o3v stars , with masses of 120  @xmath53 , are allowed . however , very high mass stars are very short lived , no more than a few million years .",
    "there is no evidence of a dense stellar association near ngc 5408 x-1 and origin in the closest super - star cluster would require a transit time to the present location on the order of 30  myr @xcite .",
    "thus , the companion mass is likely significantly lower , near 20  @xmath53 or less similar to found from studies of the stellar environments of other ulxs @xcite .",
    "figure  3 . shows the upper bound on the compact object mass for donors of 120  m@xmath3 and 20  m@xmath3 as a function of orbital period .",
    "high black hole masses are excluded , except for very short periods .",
    "we note that the heii line shift was the same in ob3 versus ob5 and ob6 , taken one day apart , suggesting that the period is longer than few days .",
    "thus , the black hole mass is likely below @xmath01800  m@xmath3 .",
    "the more probable companion mass of 20  m@xmath3 or less would imply smaller black hole masses , less than 112  m@xmath3 .    as a further constraint , we note that the orbital separation should be larger than the size of the emitting region , calculated above . assuming a circular orbit , the orbital separation of the compact object is @xmath54 .",
    "figure  3 .",
    "shows the the orbital separation as a function of period .",
    "also shown is the size of the line - emitting region , @xmath36 , versus period .",
    "both are calculated using the maximum black hole mass for each period assuming an 120  @xmath53 or 20  @xmath53 donor .",
    "the orbital separation is greater than the upper limit of the size of the line - emitting region when the compact object mass is below 875  m@xmath3 for an 120  @xmath53 companion and below 128  @xmath53 for a 20  @xmath53 companion .",
    "these masses are reduced if the inclination is lowered .",
    "these results suggest that the most probable black hole mass is at most a factor of several above the usual stellar - mass black hole range .",
    "@xcite proposed an orbital period of @xmath55 days for ngc 5408 x-1 , based on variations in the x - ray emission . with @xmath56 days , the mass function is @xmath57 13.4  m@xmath3 , implying a lower bound on the companion mass @xmath58 10.6  m@xmath3 .",
    "it is interesting to determine if this period is consistent with other constraints on the system .",
    "an orbital period of @xmath55 days would require a mean stellar density of @xmath59 g @xmath60 and , thus , a supergiant companion if mass transfer proceeds via roche - lobe overflow @xcite .",
    "in particular , late f and early g supergiants have densities close to that required , although we caution that the high mass transfer rate needed to power the ulx may distort the spectral type of the star .",
    "such stars have masses of 1012@xmath53 , consistent with the minimum mass derived from the mass function , and absolute magnitudes close to or below the upper limit quoted above .",
    "the stellar radii are large , up to 0.7  au , but smaller than the orbital separation for this period and mass .",
    "however , a companion mass so close to the lower bound on the mass function would require a very low mass compact object .",
    "for a companion mass of 1012  @xmath53 , the compact object would have to be below 1  @xmath53 , which seems unlikely .",
    "for a 5  @xmath53 black hole , one would need a donor of about 17  @xmath53 if the system is edge on . a higher black hole mass or a less extreme inclination would require an even higher mass companion .",
    "these high companion masses contradict the required stellar density ; there is no star with both @xmath61 and @xmath62 g @xmath60 .",
    "thus , either the orbital period is not near 115  days or mass transfer does not proceed via roche - lobe overflow .",
    "we note that @xcite have suggested that 115  day periodicity may , instead , indicate a super - orbital period .",
