    "the last two decades have seen the great success of many neutrino experiments , in particular , those that have contributed to the first observations of the various types of neutrino oscillation  @xcite .",
    "the `` standard '' oscillation parameters , defined in the framework of the three active neutrinos , have been determined with significant accuracy  @xcite apart from the yet unknown mass ordering , or the sign of the mass squared difference relevant for oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos , as well as the cp - violating phase , the most elusive parameter .",
    "non - oscillation experiments that have measured the neutrino cross section with high accuracy , also provided valuable information for neutrino physics  @xcite . on the other hand , there are oscillation experiments  @xcite that have observed hints for neutrino oscillation into an additional sterile neutrino state .    so far , there is no experimental evidence that neutrinos pose some non - standard properties beyond masses and mixing or some extra new interactions , different from the weak interaction , not described by the standard model ( sm ) . such interactions , often called _ non - standard interactions _",
    "( nsi ) of neutrinos , if they exist , are interesting from a phenomenological point of view , since they directly indicate the presence of some new physics beyond sm",
    ". possible presence of nsi was first pointed out by wolfenstein  @xcite , followed by the works done in @xcite in the early stage ( before the experimental discovery of neutrino oscillation  @xcite ) and afterwards , studied by a large number of authors , for example , in @xcite . in this short review ,",
    "the current status of nsi is discussed , mainly from the phenomenological point of view .",
    "phenomenologically , nsi can be described with an effective four fermion lagrangian  @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the fermi constant , @xmath2 is the parameter which describes the strength of the nsi , @xmath3 is a first generation sm fermion ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) , @xmath6 denotes the chiral projector @xmath7 , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote the neutrino flavors : @xmath10 , @xmath11 or @xmath12 .",
    "this lagrangian describes neutral current ( nc ) interactions and they will be the focus of this work .    while the lagrangian in ( [ eq : efflag ] ) provides the general description of nsi , it is also possible to study nsi using other approaches , defining the parameters depending on whether we are considering the neutrino at the production point , @xmath13 , during propagation ( taking into account matter effects ) @xmath14 , or at the detection point , @xmath15 .",
    "the reader must be aware that there is no universal notation for the nsi parameters , and some authors use similar notation for different quantities , although the definition of the parameters in terms of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : efflag ] ) and  ( [ eq : effcc ] ) ( see below ) is more standard .",
    "let us consider the presence of nsi in the neutrino source with more detail .",
    "in general , source neutrino fluxes are produced from charged current ( cc ) interactions such as pion and muon decay and , in the presence of additional non - standard cc interactions , it would be necessary to consider contributions that would include terms proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "\\label{eq : effcc}\\ ] ] in this case , the experimental value of the fermi constant will be given by  @xcite @xmath17 and would imply that the new interactions could be parameterized as  @xcite @xmath18 a similar expression could be obtained for the case of neutrino detection @xmath15 if we are interested in cc interactions .",
    "it is important to notice that for nc nsi the corresponding expression for @xmath19 is different .",
    "as will be discussed below , for nsi coming from nc , the left and right couplings @xmath20 appears naturally , while the @xmath21 for the cc case are considered to be left handed .    for the case of neutrino propagation , there is a direct relation between @xmath14 and the nsi parameters coming from the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : efflag ] )",
    ". it will be seen in section  [ sec : propagation ] that , during propagation in matter , the neutrino potential will be sensitive only to vector currents ( @xmath22 ) and , therefore , we will end up with the relation , @xmath23 where @xmath24 with @xmath25 or @xmath5 ( see section 3 ) .",
    "solar , atmospheric and long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments are expected to give better constraints on propagation nsi parameters coming from matter effects , while non oscillation experiments are more sensitive to nsi in production and/or detection .",
    "both types of experiments provide valuable complementary information on nsi .",
    "one of the main disadvantages of non - oscillation experiments is that the flavor changing nsi will be present in the interaction only at the second order level ( @xmath26 ) while propagation effects appear at first order ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "however , non - oscillation experiments also have some advantage , for instance , they may also be sensitive to axial currents , while oscillation experiments are not .    a model independent analysis that considers all the contributions coming from eq .",
    "( [ eq : efflag ] ) will imply a large number of free parameters , @xmath28 . to our knowledge",
    ", an analysis considering all the nsi contributions at the same time has never been done . in practice",
    ", one must constrain the analysis to a number of parameters that could be handled by current computational methods and give useful information about the freedom for new physics in the neutrino sector .    in this work",
    "we will discuss the current status of nsi studies .",
    "we will start by giving some examples , in section  [ sec : models ] , of the kind of new physics that can be tested by using this formalism .",
    "although we will stress the case of nc interaction , the result could be converted into constraints for new physics in the cc sector .",
    "we will show the current constraints coming from both oscillation and non - oscillation experiments in sections  [ sec : propagation ] and  [ sec : detection ] along with a brief explanation of the phenomenological procedure to obtain such bounds .",
    "future perspectives to improve the current constraints will be discussed in section  [ sec : future ] .",
    "finally , conclusions will be given in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "although the nsi formalism appears as a correction to the vector and axial couplings , it can account for different types of new physics . in this section ,",
    "three different classes of standard model extensions are described , in term of the nsi parameters , and a particular example is shown in every case as an illustration of the formalism .",
    "any extension of the sm local gauge symmetry @xmath29 , in general , introduces new gauge bosons that modify the vector and axial coupling .",
    "typical examples are @xmath30 string inspired models , that at low energies introduce the extra groups @xmath31 , leading to an additional @xmath32 neutral gauge bosons .",
    "a similar situation happens with the left - right symmetric model @xmath33 where one extra neutral and one extra charged gauge bosons , @xmath32 and @xmath34 , appear .    within the nsi formalism , there is an easy direct relation between the phenomenological parameters and the parameters coming from these models .",
    "we can consider , for instance , the neutrino dispersion off nuclei , described in the sm lagrangian @xmath35   \\left\\ { f^{ql}\\left[\\bar q\\gamma_\\mu ( 1-\\gamma^{5 } ) q\\right ] + f^{qr}\\left[\\bar q\\gamma_\\mu ( 1+\\gamma^{5 } ) q\\right ] \\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 are the sm coupling constants defined elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "for the case of @xmath30 models , where two additional neutral vector bosons arise , there will be an additional contribution to these couplings constants given by  @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass of the sm neutral gauge boson ; @xmath39 accounts for the mass of an additional , heavier , new gauge boson ; @xmath40 is the weak mixing angle ; @xmath41 is the parameter which accounts for the radiative corrections ; and the angle @xmath9 describes the mixing between the two extra gauge bosons that arise from the @xmath42 and @xmath43 symmetries .",
    "these models have yet another extra gauge boson that is considered to be heavier than the @xmath32 and decoupled from the above lagrangian .",
    "an extension of the sm fermion content can give rise to a rich phenomenology , especially when it contains extra neutral leptons , usually assumed to be heavy .",
    "within this framework , it is possible to work in the standard @xmath44 gauge symmetry and consider the additional mixing of isodoublet and isosinglet neutral leptons  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the @xmath45 couplings will deviate from the sm prediction .",
    "for example , for the case of the cc , the ordinary light isodoublet neutrinos will mix with the extra heavy isosinglets ; this mixing will be described by a matrix @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 describe , respectively , the mixing of ordinary isodoublet light neutrinos and extra heavy isosinglets .",
    "notice that the signals of new physics coming from this matrix might appear in charged currents through the deviations from the standard interactions ( that is , in the detection ) as well as in oscillation experiments , since the mixing matrix @xmath47 is no longer unitary .",
    "moreover , regarding the nc interactions , they will be described by the interaction @xmath49 where the matrix @xmath50 can be considered as a natural source for nsi in the neutral sector  @xcite .",
    "the enriched structure that arise from these models can be parameterized in different forms that must take into account all the new mixing angles and phases .",
    "one of the most studied schemes in this context is the seesaw model  @xcite , which gives a natural explanation for the smallness of the neutrino mass . in these models , however , the sizeable signals at low energies are expected to be negligible and , therefore , the effective nsi should be negligible .",
    "there are , however , other models where the low energy effects , though small , may be sizeable in the near future , such as the so - called inverse seesaw model  @xcite .    although it is not common in the literature to consider these analyses in term of the nsi formalism , it is possible to include them in the formalism .",
    "for example , for the simple case of only one extra neutral heavy lepton , the effects on a neutrino electron scattering off electrons will be a global factor in the lagrangian , due to the non - unitarity of the mixing matrix . in this case",
    "the corresponding nsi parameters for an electron neutrino experiment will be given as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the mixing angle between the light neutrino and the extra heavy fermion and @xmath53 are the sm coupling constants for the neutrino electron scattering process .      despite the nsi formalism",
    "preserves the @xmath45 structure of the theory , it is also possible to consider the impact of scalar couplings .",
    "for example , if we consider the case of low energy supersymmetry with broken r - parity  @xcite where one has trilinear @xmath54 violating couplings of the form @xmath55 with @xmath54 and @xmath56 super - fields that contain the usual lepton and quark @xmath57 doublets , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 super - fields that contain the singlets , and @xmath60 the generation indices .",
    "these couplings give rise , for example , to the following four - fermion effective lagrangian for neutrino interactions with @xmath5-quark @xmath61 where we have , among others , flavor - conserving and changing nsi , given , respectively , by @xmath62 here , @xmath63 denotes the masses of the squarks , while @xmath64 stands for @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "this is just one example , but other nsi couplings can be studied in this context  @xcite ; moreover , constraints on generic scalar nsi can also be studied by using fierz transformations  @xcite",
    "in this section , we discuss the phenomenological impact of the presence of nsi in propagation .",
    "the effect of nsi can be present through the modification of the matter potential that can exist not only in the diagonal but also in the off - diagonal elements in the effective hamiltonian . before starting our discussion on nsi we will briefly review the current standard oscillation status .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the standard three - flavor picture of neutrinos is assumed , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 and corresponding anti - particles . in vacuum ,",
    "the mixing of neutrinos is supposed to be described by the usual flavor mixing without nsi , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the 3 @xmath71 3 matrix which describes the flavor mixing  @xcite of neutrinos . in this review ,",
    "we use the standard parameterization found , e.g , in @xcite , @xmath72 \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } c_{13 }   &   0 &      s_{13}e^{-i\\delta_{cp } }   \\cr   0        &    1 &   0 \\cr   -s_{13}e^{i\\delta_{cp } } & 0   & c_{13 }   \\cr   \\end{array } \\right ] \\left [ \\begin{array}{ccc } c_{12 }   &   s_{12 } &   0   \\cr   -s_{12 } &   c_{12 } &   0 \\cr   0   & 0   & 1   \\cr   \\end{array } \\right ] ,   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "in addition to the mixing angles and cp phase , the mass squared differences of neutrinos , @xmath76 with @xmath77 ( @xmath78=1 - 3 ) being the neutrino masses , are the relevant parameters to describe neutrino oscillation .",
    "so far , all of these parameters have been measured with reasonably good accuracies except for the value of the cp phase and sign of @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "the positive ( negative ) sign of @xmath79 corresponds to the normal ( inverted ) mass ordering , often referred to as normal ( inverted ) mass hierarchy .",
    "different groups have carefully studied the neutrino data and obtained accurate values for most of the three - flavor neutrino oscillation parameters  @xcite .",

    "there are several experimental proposals that plan to improve the current knowledge of neutrino properties .",
    "therefore , there is plenty of room to improve the sensitivity to nsi in the near future .",
    "some of these experimental set - ups are discussed below , showing the future perspectives for different types of experiments .",
    "again , the discussion is divided into propagation and detection nsi .",
    "it is important to notice that , besides the need for more restrictive bounds on nsi parameters , it is also necessary to solve the possible confusion between standard and non - standard parameters .",
    "as has been stated in the past  @xcite , it is possible to have a confusion in neutrino oscillation experiments between nsi parameters and standard mixing angles , especially @xmath85 ; recently , this subject has been discussed in the context of solar  @xcite and reactor neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the significant progress in improving the precision on @xmath85 will strongly restrict this possibility in the near future .",
    "another important topic in this direction is that of the robustness of the solar neutrino data against nsi . it might be possible that large nsi effect give rise to a dark - lma solution without contradicting any current experimental result  @xcite .",
    "this solution has persisted as a plausible picture  @xcite . a recent study on the future combined data of juno  @xcite ,",
    "reno-50  @xcite and nova  @xcite has discussed the perspectives to exclude this solution  @xcite .",
    "different experimental set - ups ( proposed to increase the precision for the determination of the neutrino oscillations parameters ) have been considered in the last years .",
    "the need for a better knowledge of the kobayashi - maskawa type cp phase in the lepton sector as well as the mass ordering is certainly a major motivation for these proposals .",
    "currently ongoing experiments such as t2k and nova may improve somewhat the current bounds on some nsi parameters but probably not so much , especially for that coming from the @xmath86 appearance mode due to relatively small statistics .",
    "hyper - kamiokande  @xcite is an interesting proposal that expects to improve the sensitivity to nsi , by using the atmospheric neutrino data  @xcite ; their expectations for the normal hierarchy case are particularly appealing . on the other hand , for the case of the lbne  @xcite and lbno  @xcite proposals ,",
    "the expected sensitivity to nsi is also encouraging , especially for the flavor changing case of @xmath87 and @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "finally , important constraints are expected from the icecube deep core and pingu experiments .",
    "these are extensions of the icecube experiment focused on a lower energy range . in this case",
    ", the expectations to constrain the flavor changing nsi parameter @xmath87 could reach the one percent level .",
    "for the flavor diagonal case , it might be possible to obtain information about the elusive parameter @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "the future neutrino oscillation experiments will also be sensitive to the nsi parameters through a detection effect .",
    "for instance , for the case of the proposed juno  @xcite and reno-50  @xcite an improvement to the constraints on @xmath88 and @xmath90 is expected  @xcite .    for the case of the interaction of electron neutrinos with electrons ,",
    "both isodar  @xcite and lena  @xcite proposals could give complementary information if both proposals are done in the future .",
    "in the case of isodar , it is proposed to use an intense anti - neutrino @xmath91li source , with an anti - neutrino energy ranging up to @xmath92 mev , in combination with the kamland liquid scintillator  @xcite .",
    "the lena proposal plans to use a neutrino chromium source , providing a monochromatic neutrino flux of energy , @xmath93 mev , located at the top of a @xmath94  kton liquid scintillator cylindrical detector  @xcite .",
    "these are not the only proposals for neutrino electron scattering , but they illustrate the future potential of this experiments .",
    "the use of either a neutrino or anti - neutrino source leads to a better determination of the left or right - handed couplings , respectively . therefore ,",
    "if both neutrino and anti - neutrino experiments are done in the future , there could be a good room for the improvement of the nsi parameters .",
    "we illustrate this by showing , in fig .",
    "[ nu - e : future ] , the expected sensitivity for the case of a neutrino artificial source in combination with the proposed lena detector as has already been calculated in @xcite , where an expected total number of @xmath95 neutrino events and a @xmath96  % systematic error was considered .",
    "the case of an anti - neutrino source is also shown in fig .",
    "[ nu - e : future ] . in this last case",
    "the analysis developed in @xcite has been closely followed .",
    "the expected result from the combined analysis of both future experiments is shown by the region filled by the magenta color .",
    "we show in the same figure one of the current constraints on nsi , coming from the solar neutrino analysis  @xcite .",
    "it is possible to see that there is room for improving these constraints by almost one order of magnitude , especially if both experiments are realized .",
    "-0.6 cm 0.6 cm -1.2 cm    regarding the nsi of neutrinos with quarks , there are severals proposals that could improve current bounds .",
    "an interesting proposal is that of neutrino coherent scattering off nuclei  @xcite .",
    "after seminal works on the construction of these type of detectors  @xcite , there was a renewed interest in the previous decade  @xcite .",
    "at the same time , the sensitivity to nsi parameters and new physics searches was also noted  @xcite .",
    "different experimental set - ups have already been considered , either using a reactor anti - neutrino flux  @xcite , and spallation source  @xcite , beta beams  @xcite , or pion decay  @xcite .",
    "these experiments could have an excellent sensitivity to the nsi .",
    "in particular , the texono proposal has been studied in the past , using either a @xmath97ge or @xmath98si as a detector ; an improvement of even one order of magnitude could be achieved in this case  @xcite .",
    "other possible nuclei have also been studied  @xcite such as @xmath99ti and @xmath100al .",
    "neutrino experiments have shown the existence of a new sector beyond the standard model because of the experimental evidences of nonzero neutrino masses that is already part of the current knowledge on particle physics .",
    "the mass and mixing of lepton sector turned out to be non - trivial , very different from that of the quark sector . while our knowledge on neutrino properties are continuously improving , the theoretical explanation of the neutrino mixing and the neutrino mass pattern is still an open question .    in this context , possible presence of the non - standard interaction of neutrinos and its impact was discussed in this brief review from a phenomenological point of view , describing the current status on the search for new physics coming from nsi .",
    "so far there is no experimental evidence or indication of the presence of nsi and there exist only the constraints , which are summarized in tables [ tab : table - nsi - propagation ] ,  [ tab : constraint - e - det ] and [ tab : constraint - d - det ] where we show the lower and upper bounds of the nsi parameters .",
    "ongoing as well as proposed near future neutrino experiments are expected to improve considerably the nsi bounds or may indicate the presence of nsi .",

    "<S> neutrino oscillations have become well - known phenomenon ; the measurements of neutrino mixing angles and mass squared differences are continuously improving . </S>",
    "<S> future oscillation experiments will eventually determine the remaining unknown neutrino parameters , namely , the mass ordering , normal or inverted , and the cp - violating phase . on the other hand , the absolute mass scale of neutrinos could be probed by cosmological observations , single beta decay as well as by neutrinoless double beta decay experiments . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the last one may shed light on the nature of neutrinos , dirac or majorana , by measuring the effective majorana mass of neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> however , the neutrino mass generation mechanism remains unknown . </S>",
    "<S> a well - motivated phenomenological approach to search for new physics , in the neutrino sector , is that of non - standard interactions . in this short review , </S>",
