    "mergers of galaxies have long been known to play an important role in the evolution of galaxies .",
    "detailed case studies in the local universe have shown the powerful effect mergers can have on galaxy morphologies and on the triggering of star formation ( e.g. kennicutt 1996 ; schweizer 1996 ) .",
    "the importance of mergers has also been emphasized by computer simulations involving either major mergers of galaxies with comparable mass , or the merger of dwarf galaxies with a more massive galaxy ( mihos & hernquist 1994a , b ; hernquist & mihos 1995 ; mihos 1995 , hereafter m95 ) .",
    "if merging is at work at all during the lifetime of galaxies , then the space density , mass , luminosity , and morphology of galaxies must change with epoch .",
    "several authors suggest that merging systems can explain part ( or all ) of the excess number of galaxies observed in deep photometric galaxy counts ( rocca - volmerange & guiderdoni 1990 ; broadhurst , ellis & glazebrook 1992 ) .",
    "mergers can influence such surveys either by the separate counting of individual systems ultimately destined to merge , or through more subtle effects .",
    "for example , dissipative mergers are expected to trigger some degree of star formation , so in magnitude - limited samples one expects to observe less massive galaxies brightened above observational limits by merger - induced star - formation activity .    the evolution of the merger rate with redshift is a key observable that can be used to test galaxy formation models ( see abraham 1998 for a review ) . in particular , semi - analytical models for galaxy formation in hierarchical clustering scenarios postulate that galaxies assemble from the successive merger of smaller sub - units .",
    "such models make concrete predictions for the relationships between evolution in the morphological mix and redshift - dependent merger rates ( baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ; baugh et al .",
    "1998 ; kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 ; kauffmann 1996 ) .",
    "evolution of the luminosity function of galaxies at high redshifts ( lilly et al .",
    "1995 , ellis et al .",
    "1996 ) indicates that , on the whole , either the typical luminosity of galaxies was brighter by @xmath121 magnitude at @xmath13 , or that there were @xmath123 times more galaxies at this epoch , or that a combination of both luminosity and number density evolution is occurring .",
    "disentangling the effects of these two phenomena is central to understanding the nature of field galaxy evolution .",
    "luminosity evolution has been shown to play an important role in the evolution of disk galaxies , from observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) of systems from the cfrs ",

    "number - density evolution remains poorly constrained .",
    "there are several reasons why meaningful constraints on number - density evolution have been difficult to obtain .",
    "one needs large galaxy samples with redshifts measured up to large look - back times _ and _ deep high spatial resolution images in order to observe the close environment of galaxies at better than 1  kpc resolution .",
    "furthermore , the time - scales associated with merging are not straightforward to constrain .",
    "there is considerable uncertainty in any transformation from an `` instantaneous '' merger rate ( computed directly from observations at a given look - back time ) to a `` global '' merger rate indicating the likelihood for a galaxy to experience merging from any epoch to the present .",
    "data from hst indicates that , at moderate redshifts , there is a larger proportion of faint galaxies exhibiting peculiar morphologies suggestive of merging ( griffiths et al .",

    "galaxies near the edge of the wfpc2 field ( those systems for which a full @xmath31 kpc area around them was not visible ) were removed from the sample .",
    "the redshift and magnitude distributions of the hst samples are similar to the distributions of their parent cfrs and ldss samples ( as described by brinchmann et al .",
    "in this section we seek to identify merger events through visual classification . in this procedure",
    "we attempt to distinguish broadly between probable `` major '' and `` minor '' merging events .",
    "a major merger , involving galaxies of comparable masses , should produce strong morphological signatures , such as double nuclei , wisps , tails , shells , asymmetric morphology , and possibly be associated with the triggering of a recent starburst ( mihos & hernquist 1994a ; liu & kennicutt 1995 ) .",
    "minor mergers , involving a massive galaxy and a small dwarf , are likely to be more frequent ( m95 ; baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ) , and produce more benign morphological signatures which might be difficult to identify during or shortly after the merging event , although significant changes of the star formation rate can result from this type of event .",
    "it is emphasized that the visibility of merger - induced features may be relatively short lived , depending on the respective masses of the galaxies involved ( m95 ) , making the identification of even relatively recently completed mergers a challenging task .",
    "we have defined the following visual classification scheme to identify merger events : + ( 0 ) not a merger : no trace of merger , although some minor asymmetry may be present + ( 1 ) suspicious : there is a suspicion that some merging event might be occurring , with some asymmetry and traces of wisps , tails , etc .",
    "+ ( 2 ) probable merger / upcoming merger : there is a nearby galaxy but the isophotes are not overlapping at the @xmath26 mag  arcsec@xmath27 isophote level . + ( 3 ) on - going merger : a merging event is most probably or certainly occurring , as evidenced by strong asymmetry , double nuclei , prominent wisps , tails , etc .    in the following analysis ,",
    "classes 2 and 3 are summed to produce the list of visually identified mergers .",
    "the separation in classes 2 and 3 is used in section  [ oii ] , but we emphasize that the separation between classes 2 and 3 is sensitive to the depth of the limiting isophote chosen , as the primary and companion galaxy may well be `` bridged '' by luminous material at levels fainter than the observations are able to reveal .",
    "all galaxies in the sample have been visually examined by 3 of us ( jb , olf , sjl ) , and classified in the above scheme .",
    "when a classification was discrepant among the 3 observers , the median class has been taken as the final classification .",
    "a total of 261 galaxies have a secure redshift measurement ; among these , 22 are classified in class 3 , and 4 in class 2 .",
    "this leads to an overall merger fraction for the whole sample of @xmath32% .",
    "a total of 63 galaxies do not have a redshift , of which 3 are in class 2 and 4 are in class 3 , giving a merger fraction for this sample of @xmath33% .",
    "galaxies without redshifts therefore have a merger fraction comparable to that for the whole sample , and no bias in the merger rate estimate is expected from restricting the analysis to galaxies with secure redshifts .",
    "the list of visually identified mergers is given in table  1 .",
    "images of the mergers are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : imerg ] and the histogram of the redshift distribution is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pmerg ] .",
    "the fraction of visually identified mergers vs. redshift is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pmerg ] : it is evident that most of the identified mergers are at the high redshift end of the sample .",
    "another approach to identifying mergers is to count pairs of galaxies as observed in projection , and to use these pair counts to estimate the physical pair fraction in the sample ( see e.g. patton et al .",
    "physical pairs of galaxies separated by small distances and with low relative speeds are bound and are destined to merge on relatively short timescales .",
    "we have performed a pair count analysis using both a visual approach ( based on counts of galaxies with measured redshifts for which nearby galaxies form a pair as observed in projection ) , and using the machine - based automated approach described in section  [ slee ] . because we usually have knowledge of the redshift for only one of the pair components , some of the pairs can be produced by foreground - background projection contamination .",
    "this effect needs to be corrected for in order to estimate physical pair counts , which can then be related to the merger rate .",
    "this section describes the manual and automated classification methods used to estimate the apparent pair fraction , leading to the computation of the physical pair fraction in the next section .",

    "mergers can change the luminosity function of galaxies through a combination of both number density and luminosity evolution .",
    "in addition to the obvious effects of density evolution , mergers may also brighten galaxies to the point where systems that would otherwise drop below the magnitude limits of a survey become included in the sample .",
    "two effects can contribute to the luminosity enhancement of a galaxy in a merging pair . in a dissipationless merger , the luminosities of the two galaxies add with a final luminosity being ( at most ) twice that of the most luminous pre - merging galaxy .",
    "however , merging may also trigger additional stellar formation , particularly during later stages of the merging process ( hernquist & mihos 1995 ) , increasing the total luminosity by adding to the overall stellar content of the combined system . as star - formation activity should have a longer timescale than the timescale during which the morphological evidence for a merger remains ( m95 ) ,",
    "a global star formation increase might be expected in a galaxy population subjected to a higher rate of merging .",
    "these two effects are quantified in the following sections .",
    "the brightening of the galaxy population induced by merging can be one of the contributors to the observed evolution of the luminosity function ( lilly et al .",

    ", we looked at the brightest pairs selected from our @xmath1 mag criterion .",
    "the minimum luminosity enhancement induced by a close pair , if destined to merge , has simply been taken as the co - addition of the luminosities of the galaxies in a pair , assuming no extra star formation triggered by the event .",
    "we have computed the magnitudes of each galaxy in a pair from the hst images ( excluding close companions ) and a conservative estimate of the final magnitude of the merged pair was obtained by simply adding the luminosities from the two galaxies , the resulting magnitude being equal to the ground based magnitude ( brinchmann et al .",
    "the luminosity enhancement estimated by this simple procedure is shown in column 8 of table  2 for each pair , and is on average 0.5 mag for the sample of galaxies classified as pairs .",

    "this indicates that 18/151 galaxies , or @xmath105% of the galaxies at @xmath106 will experience a brightening of at least 0.5 magnitude within the next billion years or so due to merging . as the merger timescales are subject to considerable uncertainties , we can only speculate that this fraction of galaxies is the minimum fraction of galaxies in the sample which would experience a brightening over a time span of @xmath107gyr .",
    "we note that some of these galaxies will be brought artificially into a magnitude limited sample produced from ground based observations , because the total magnitude of the galaxy is coming from closely paired galaxies as the result of projection effects ( table  3 ) , with each of the individual galaxies in the pair being fainter than the magnitude limit of the sample , as described in section  [ s3 ] .      to estimate the star formation enhancement produced during the merger process",
    ", we have looked at the [ ] @xmath1083727 equivalent width for three sub - samples : on - going mergers , upcoming mergers , and galaxies with no companions , as classified during the analysis detailed in section  [ s2 ] . _ on - going major mergers",

    "major mergers are defined as systems with a galaxy with @xmath1 mag at a distance @xmath111 kpc from a galaxy in the redshift sample , but where the isophotes of the two galaxies are not overlapping at the depth of our images .",
    "of course a single galaxy can have a total number of upcoming or ongoing mergers larger than one .",
    "differences in the [ ] equivalent width between the on - going and upcoming merger classes could then indicate the effect of merging on the star formation rate .    .",

    "( 1998 ) , @xmath112 and @xmath52 are the magnitude difference and the distance in arcseconds and kpc between the two galaxies in the pair respectively .",
    "a value `` 9999 '' indicates that @xmath42 or a could not be computed . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     our results are summarized in table  4 , which shows that the [ ] equivalent width of up - coming mergers is not significantly different from the equivalent width of non - merging galaxies , while the equivalent width of on - going mergers at @xmath113 is @xmath114 , 2 times higher than for non - merger galaxies ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "on - going mergers may thus have a star formation rate increased by a factor 2 , with a corresponding luminosity increase , as a result of the merging process .",
    "it is noteworthy that a significant fraction of the star formation may be obscured by dust , as dust is often seen in merging systems , and therefore , that the star formation rate increase measured from [ ] should be taken as a lower limit ( hammer et al .",
    "in this section we examine the effect of having selected our galaxy sample from a redshift survey based on ground - based imaging . some of the galaxies in the redshift survey",
    "are now identified from hst imaging as pairs of nearby galaxies unresolved in ground - based data .",
    "seeing effects clearly lead ground - based surveys to include some galaxies in magnitude limited samples only because the added luminosity from a close companion is sufficient to produce a total blended luminosity above a limiting magnitude threshold . from the analysis of the magnitude difference with the closest companion as described in section  [ le ] , we find that in the galaxies of the cfrs sample imaged with hst , 11 ( of 232 ) galaxies have been included in the ground - based redshift survey because of this effect .",
    "this is most significant for @xmath116 , as 6 ( of 73 ) galaxies above this redshift are in the complete hst - cfrs sample because of this effect , which enters at the @xmath117% level .",
    "this bias also demonstrates the difficulties inherent in comparing deep galaxy counts obtained from ground - based and space - based observations .",
    "taking this effect into account would lower the physical pair fraction , corrected for background / foreground contamination , from 9.9% to 8.1% at @xmath86 and from 20.3% to 14.5% at @xmath87 .",
    "this would lower the parameter @xmath118 describing the physical pair rate change with redshift to @xmath119 .",
    "the visual classification of mergers , and the pair count analysis performed using manual classifications and using the lee classifier , paint a consistent picture of the effects of mergers on high redshift galaxies .",
    "our analysis shows that major mergers of galaxies ( @xmath1 ) are playing an increasingly important role at higher redshifts , both in terms of number evolution and in inducing a significant luminosity enhancement . from the visual classification of mergers , we find that the merger fraction evolves as @xmath120 , with @xmath5 , in excellent agreement with the merger fraction derived from the pair counts , for which @xmath121 .    as shown explicitly in section  [ s3 ] , ground - based magnitude - limited imaging samples can be biased by the effects of seeing , as close pairs of galaxies are counted singly . around @xmath122% of high redshift @xmath123 galaxies that are formally below the selection limit",
    "would be included in a ground based @xmath124 mag sample due to this effect .",
    "if our magnitude limited redshift survey had been defined from hst imaging data rather than from imaging data limited by ground based seeing , the pair fraction at @xmath74 would be lowered from @xmath2 to @xmath125 .",
    "after correction for this bias , we conclude that the merger fraction evolution exponent can best be parameterized as @xmath126 .",
    "transforming the observed merger fraction into a merger rate requires knowledge of the average timescale over which a merger is completed ( i.e. over which morphological traces of the merger are gone at the 1  kpc resolution at which we are observing the present sample ) .",
    "although there are considerable uncertainties in estimating this timescale , an upper limit of 400  myr to 1  gyr seems reasonable from both data and simulations ( e.g. patton et al .",
    "1997 ; mihos & hernquist 1994b ) .",
    "our results indicate that between redshift 0 and 0.9 , the merger probability is @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the merger timescale , and @xmath129 between @xmath130 and @xmath131 . using a ( conservative ) range of merger timescales from 400  myr to 1  gyr , these relations suggest a galaxy will undergo on average 0.8 to 1.8 merger events from @xmath8 to @xmath9 , with 0.5 to 1.2 merger events occurring in a 2  gyr time span at @xmath10 .",
    "semi - analytical models of galaxy formation in hierarchical clustering theories make strong predictions regarding the high - redshift merger rate .",
    "the model of baugh et al .",
    "( 1996 ) predicts that more than 50% of the elliptical galaxies , and 15% of the spiral galaxies suffered a major merger event in the redshift interval @xmath132 , while by @xmath0 , these numbers increase to more than 90% and 55% for ellipticals and spirals respectively , indicating the lower and upper limits for the whole population of galaxies ( baugh et al .",
    "these values appear broadly consistent with the numbers derived above from our data .",
    "as the galaxies merge , two galaxies will be replaced by one which will be on average 0.5 magnitudes brighter from the simple co - addition of the initial luminosities , and an additional temporary star formation rate increase of a factor of @xmath122 , triggered by the merger event . with the increase in the number of mergers at high redshifts ,",
    "merger events will contribute significantly to the evolution of the luminosity function by making l@xmath7 brighter , and the number density smaller , with changing redshift .",
    "the analysis we have conducted has mainly been targeted at the most obvious merger events .",
    "we note that the number evolution and luminosity evolution that we have derived probably minimizes the full effect of mergers as the image resolution and depth of our hst data do not allow us to take into account mergers of smaller galaxies with bright galaxies in our sample ( i.e. systems with @xmath133 mag ) .",
    "our results demonstrate the importance of mergers in the evolution of the luminosity function and of the luminosity density of the universe out to @xmath134 .",
    "the derivation of the merger fraction and of the merger rate at still higher redshifts is of great interest in order to determine the contribution of mergers to the putative peak or flattening in the uv luminosity density of the universe inferred to lie at a redshift between 1 and 2 ( madau et al .",
