    "although the word is widely used in linguistics , psychology , and philosophy , the notion of contextuality as it is used in this paper comes from quantum mechanics , where in turn it came from logic @xcite .",
    "the reason for the prominence of this notion in quantum theory is that classical - mechanical systems are not contextual while some quantum - mechanical systems are .",
    "contextuality is sometimes even presented as one of the `` paradoxes '' of quantum mechanics . in psychology ,",
    "as it turns out , a certain variety of ( non)contextuality has been prominent too , but it is known under different name : selectiveness of influences , or lack thereof _ _ ( for details , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the term `` contextuality '' refers to properties of systems of random variables each of which can be viewed ( sometimes artificially ) as a measurement of some `` object '' in some _",
    "context_. for instance , an object @xmath0 may be a question , and the context may be defined by what other question @xmath1 it is asked in combination with .",
    "then the answer to this question is a random variable @xmath2 that can be interpreted as the measurement of @xmath0 in the context @xmath3 .",
    "if the same question @xmath0 is then asked in combination with some other question @xmath4 , then the measurement is a different random variable , @xmath5 .",
    "more generally , context in which @xmath0 is measured is defined by the conditions @xmath6 under which the measurement is made , yielding random variable @xmath7 .",
    "this notation ( or one of numerous variants thereof ) is called _ contextual notation _ for random variables : it codifies the idea that the identity of a measurement is defined both by what is measured and by the conditions under it is measured @xcite .    within each context",
    "the measurements are made `` together '' , because of which they have an empirically defined _",
    "joint distribution_. thus , in context @xmath3 we have two jointly distributed random variables @xmath2 and @xmath8 .",
    "we call the set of all random variables jointly recorded in a given context a _ bunch _ ( of random variables , or of measurements ) .",
    "two different bunches have no joint distribution , because there is no empirically defined way of coupling the values of one bunch with those of another .",
    "we say that they are _ stochastically unrelated_. thus , in @xmath9 any component of @xmath10 is stochastically unrelated to any component of @xmath11 , including @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",

    ", this means finding four jointly distributed random variables @xmath12 such that , in reference to ( [ eq:2 bunches ] ) , @xmath13 @xmath14 standing for `` is distributed as '' .",
    "the quadruple @xmath12 is then called a _",
    "coupling _ for the bunches @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the `` well - chosen constraints '' is a key notion in the formulation above . in our example",
    ", these constraints should apply to @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the coupling counterparts of @xmath2 and @xmath5 measuring ( answering ) the same question @xmath0 in two different contexts .",
    "intuitively , `` noncontextuality '' means `` independence of context '' , and because of this it is tempting to say that the system of two bunches in ( [ eq:2 bunches ] ) is noncontextual if we can consider @xmath2 and @xmath5 as `` one and the same '' random variable , @xmath17 .",
    "this may appear simple , but in fact it is logically impossible : since @xmath2 and @xmath5 are stochastically unrelated , they can not be `` the same ''",
    ". a random variable can not be stochastically unrelated to itself .",
    "the precise meaning here comes from considering couplings @xmath12 for the two bunches . clearly , in every such a coupling @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we can say that the measurement of @xmath0 in the system is context - independent if among all possible couplings @xmath12 there is at least one in which @xmath20=0 $ ] . in this particular example , due to its simplicity ( only three random variables involved in two contexts ) it can be shown that such a coupling does exist , provided @xmath21 . in a more complex system , such a coupling may not exists even if the system is _ consistently connected _ : which means that in this system the measurements of one and the same `` object '' always have the same distribution .    the traditional approaches to contextuality",
    "were confined to consistent connectedness , but this condition is too restrictive in quantum physics @xcite and virtually inapplicable in social and behavioral sciences : almost always , a response to question ( or stimulus ) @xmath0 will depend on the context in which it is asked , which may translate into @xmath2 and @xmath5 having different distributions .",
    "there is nothing wrong in calling any such a case contextual , and this is done by many ( see sections [ sec : question - order - effect ] and [ sec : word - combinations :- results ] below ) .",
    "it is , however , more informative to separate inconsistent connectedness from contextuality , and this is what is done in the cbd theory .",
    "we use the term _ inconsistently connected _ for the systems that are not necessarily consistently connected ( but may be so , as a special or limit case ) .",
    "the logic of the cbd approach is as follows .",
    "we first consider separately the random variables measuring the same object in different contexts , in our example @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "we call this set of random variables the _ connection _",
    "( for the measured object , in our case @xmath0 ) . among all possible couplings @xmath22 for the connection @xmath23 ,",
    "i.e. , among all jointly distributed @xmath22 such that @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we find the minimal value @xmath26 of @xmath27 $ ] .",
    "then we look at the entire system of the bunches , in our case ( [ eq:2 bunches ] ) , and among all possible couplings @xmath12 for this system we find the minimal value @xmath28 for @xmath20 $ ]",
    ". it should be clear that @xmath26 can not exceed @xmath28 , because in every coupling @xmath12 for ( [ eq:2 bunches ] ) the part @xmath29 forms a coupling for the connection @xmath23 .",
    "but they can be equal , @xmath30 , and then we say that the system is noncontextual . if @xmath31 , the system is contextual",
    "again , due to its simplicity , the system consisting of the two bunches ( [ eq:2 bunches ] ) can not be contextual , but this may very well be the case in more complex systems .    as an example of the latter , consider a system with two bunches @xmath32 in which there are only two `` objects '' @xmath33 , and the two contexts differ in the order in which these objects are measured .",
    "we have two connections here , @xmath34 let us assume the measurements are binary , with values @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( e.g. , corresponding to answers yes and no ) , and let us further assume that all four random variables are `` fair coins '' , with equal probabilities of + 1 and -1",
    ". then the distribution of the bunches @xmath10 and @xmath37 in ( [ eq:2 bunches order ] ) are uniquely defined by the product expected values @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it easy to see that , across all possible couplings @xmath22 for @xmath40 , the minimum value @xmath41 of @xmath27 $ ] is 0 , and the same is true for the minimum value @xmath42 of @xmath43 $ ] across all possible couplings @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "however , it follows from the general theory that across all possible couplings @xmath12 for the entire system ( [ eq:2 bunches order ] ) the values @xmath46 of @xmath20 $ ] and @xmath47 of @xmath48 $ ] can not be both zero unless @xmath49 .",
    "the latter need not be the case : it may , e.g. , very well be that @xmath50 ( perfect correlation ) and @xmath51 ( perfect anti - correlation ) . in this case",
    "@xmath52 , whence either @xmath53 or @xmath54 , indicating that the system is contextual .",
    "as we show in this paper , the general rule for a broad spectrum of behavioral and social systems of measurements seems to be that _ they are all noncontextual in the sense of cbd_.",
    "in this section and throughout the rest of the paper we assume that all our measurements are binary random variables , with values @xmath55 .",
    "we apply the logic of the cbd theory to systems in which all objects are measured in pairs so that each object belongs to precisely two pairs .",
    "we call such systems _ cyclic _ , because we can enumerate the objects in such a system @xmath56 and arrange them in a cycle @xmath57 & q_{2}\\ar[r ] & \\cdots\\ar[r ] & q_{n-1}\\ar[r ] & q_{n}\\ar@/^{1pc}/[llll],}\\ ] ] in which any two successive objects form a context . the number @xmath58 is referred to as the _ rank _ of the system .",
    "our last example in the previous section is a cyclic system of rank 2 , the smallest possible .    in accordance with our notation ,",
    "each object @xmath59 in a cyclic system is measured by two random variables : @xmath60 and @xmath61 , where the operations @xmath62 and @xmath63 are cyclic addition and subtraction ( so that @xmath64 and @xmath65 )",
    ". since there are no other random variables involved , we can simplify notation : we will denote @xmath60 , measuring the first object in the context , by @xmath66 , and @xmath61 , measuring the second object in the context , by @xmath67 . as a result each bunch in a cyclic system has the form @xmath68 ; e.g. , the bunch of measurements for @xmath69 is @xmath70 , for @xmath71 the bunch is @xmath72 , etc .",
    "now we can represent a cyclic system of measurements in the form of a @xmath73 cycle : @xmath74 & w_{2}\\ar@{.}[r ] & v_{2}\\ar@{-}[r ] & w_{3}\\ar@{.}[r ] & \\cdots\\ar@{.}[r ] & v_{n}\\ar@{-}[r ] & w_{1}\\ar@/^{1pc}/@{.}[llllll],}\\ ] ] where solid lines indicate bunches ( joint measurements ) and point lines indicate connections ( measurements of the object in different contexts ) .",
    "it is proved in refs .",
    "@xcite that such a system is noncontextual if and only if its bunches satisfy the following inequality : @xmath75 where @xmath76 denotes expected value , and the @xmath77-part is the maximum of all linear combinations @xmath78 with the proviso that the number of minuses is odd . note that the criterion is written entirely in terms of the expectations of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and of the products @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "this means that the information about a cyclic system we need can be presented in the form of the diagram    @xmath81^{\\langle v_{1}w_{2}\\rangle } & { \\scriptstyle \\langle w_{2}\\rangle } \\ar@{.}[r ] & { \\scriptstyle \\langle v_{2}\\rangle } \\ar@{-}[r]^{\\langle v_{2}w_{3}\\rangle } & \\cdots\\ar@{.}[r ] & { \\scriptstyle \\langle v_{n}\\rangle } \\ar@{-}[r]^{\\langle v_{n}w_{1}\\rangle } & { \\scriptstyle \\langle w_{1}\\rangle } \\ar@/^{1pc}/@{.}[lllll ] . }",
    "\\label{eq : diagram}\\ ] ]    we will use such diagrams to discuss experimental data in the subsequent sections .    this criterion of noncontextuality is generally breached by quantum - mechanical systems .",
    "thus , for consistently connected systems , for @xmath82 , the inequality reduces to suppes - zanotti - leggett - garg inequality @xcite , for @xmath83 it acquires the form of the clauser - horn - shimony - holt inequalities for the einstein - podolsky - rosen - bell paradigm @xcite , and for @xmath84 ( with an additional constraint ) it becomes what is known as klyachko - can - binicioglu - shumovsky inequality @xcite .",
    "all of them are predicted by quantum theory and supported by experiments to be violated by some quantum - mechanical systems . for @xmath82 , using the criterion ( [ eq : criterion general ] ) , violations are also predicted for inconsistently connected systems @xcite ; and for @xmath84 violations of ( [ eq : criterion general ] ) were demonstrated experimentally @xcite ( as analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "by contrast , we find no violations of ( [ eq : criterion general ] ) in all known to us behavioral and social experiments aimed at revealing contextuality : @xmath85 never exceeds zero .",
    "in the subsequent sections we demonstrate this `` failure to fail '' the noncontextuality criterion on several experimental studies , for cyclic systems of rank 2 , 3 , and 4 .",

    "the logic of an experiment was as follows .",
    "the participant was shown two stimuli , target one ( @xmath174 ) and adjustable one ( @xmath15 ) , both completely specified by two parameters . in each trial , the values @xmath175 and @xmath176 of these parameters ( real numbers ) in the target stimulus @xmath177 are fixed at one of several values , each pair of values determining a context ; in the adjustable stimulus the two parameters can be simultaneously or ( in some experiments ) successively changed by the participant rotating a trackball . at the end of each trial",

    "they form four contexts that can be cyclically arranged as @xmath182 , and for each of them we get empirical distributions of @xmath16 and @xmath178 : @xmath183 for context @xmath69 , @xmath184 for context @xmath185 , etc . in this notation , of the two objects @xmath186 , the random variable @xmath187 `` measures '' the @xmath0 with an odd index ( 1 or 3 ) , whether @xmath188 or @xmath189 ; analogously , @xmath190 `` measures '' the @xmath0 with the even index .",
    "the values of @xmath16 and @xmath178 are then dichotomized in the following way : we choose a value @xmath191 and a value @xmath192 ( @xmath193 , @xmath194 ) and define @xmath195 @xmath196 the values of @xmath197 can be chosen in a variety of ways , and for each choice we apply to the obtained @xmath164 and @xmath165 variables the criterion ( [ eq : criterion n=00003d4 ] ) .     extracted from experiment 1a , participant p3 , about 200 replications per context.,title=\"fig : \" ] extracted from experiment 1a , participant p3 , about 200 replications per context.,title=\"fig : \" ]     extracted from experiment 1a , participant p3 , about 200 replications per context.,title=\"fig : \" ] extracted from experiment 1a , participant p3 , about 200 replications per context.,title=\"fig : \" ]    as an example , in one of the experiments the stimuli @xmath174 and @xmath15 were two dots in two circles , like the ones shown in figure 2 , top , with a dot s position within a circle described in polar coordinates ( @xmath175 and @xmath16 denoting distance from the center in pixels , @xmath176 and @xmath178 denoting angle in degrees measured counterclockwise from the horizontal rightward radius - vector ) .",
    "we extract from this experiment a @xmath198 subdesign as shown in figure 3 .",

    "in fact negative values of @xmath85 are obtained for all @xmath207 dichotomizations .",
    "clearly , different dichotomizations of the same random variables are not stochastically independent , but there is no mathematical reason for @xmath85 to be of the same sign in all of them .    in the supplementary file s3",
    "we describe in detail how the dichotomizations were made , their number ranging from 3024 to 11,663,568 per @xmath198 ( sub)design in each experiment for each participant .",
    "the outcome is : not a single case with positive @xmath85 observed .",
    "the empirical data analyzed above suggest that the noncontextuality boundaries , that are generally breached in quantum physics , are not breached by behavioral and social systems .",
    "this may seem a disappointing conclusion for some . with the realization that quantum formalisms may be used to construct models in various areas outside physics @xcite",
    ", the expectation was created that human behavior should exhibit contextuality , perhaps even on a greater scale than allowed by quantum theory .",
    "however , if the no - contextuality conclusion of the present paper is proved to be a rule for a very broad class of behavioral and social systems , it is rather fortunate for behavioral and social sciences . noncontextuality means more constrained behavior , and constraints allow one to make predictions .",
    "the power of quantum mechanics is not in that quantum systems breach the classical - mechanical bounds of noncontextuality , but in the theory that imposes other , equally strict constraints .",
    "presence of contextuality , in the absence of a general theory like quantum mechanics , translates into unpredictability .",
    "it must be noted that absence of contextuality in behavioral and social systems does not mean that quantum formalisms are not applicable to them . a good argument for why this conclusion would be groundless is provided by the question order effect discussed in section [ sec : question - order - effect ] : it is precisely the applicability of a quantum - mechanical model in the question order effect analysis @xcite that allows one to predict the lack of contextuality in this paradigm .",
    "when discussing contextuality , one should be aware of the likelihood of purely terminological confusions .",
    "it is clear that in the behavioral and social systems a context generally influences the measurement of an object within it .",
    "for instance , the distribution of answers to a question depends on a question asked and answered before it .",
    "one could call this contextuality , and many do .",
    "this is , however , a trivial sense of contextuality , on a par with the fact that the distribution of answers to a question depends on what this question is .",
    "one should not be surprised that other factors ( such as temperature in the lab or questions asked and answered previously ) can influence this distribution too .",
    "we call this inconsistent connectedness , and we offer a theory that distinguishes this ubiquitous feature from contextuality in a different , one could argue more interesting meaning .",
