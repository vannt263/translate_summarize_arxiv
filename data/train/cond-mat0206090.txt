    "the ising model of sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) @xcite with quenched random bonds is the most important representative of a class of long - ranged models all describing spin glasses ( for general references see @xcite ) . for the static analysis of this model",
    "two complementary but conceptually different approaches exist .",
    "the first approach uses the replica method @xcite and the breaking of the replica symmetry @xcite to calculate bond - averaged quantities .",
    "the approach of thouless - anderson - palmer ( tap ) @xcite is based on more conventional techniques and does not perform this bond average as it is expected that macroscopic physical quantities will be independent of the particular configuration in the thermodynamic limit .    although the tap equations are well established @xcite they are still a field of current interest .",
    "it is suspected that not all aspects of this approach have yet been worked out .",
    "recently the author @xcite has reanalyzed the stability of these equations and has shown that unstable states can not be described by the original tap equations .",
    "therefore he proposed modified tap equations which turned out to be useful for explicit numerical calculations of the characteristic features of the sk model of finite - sizes @xcite .",
    "dynamical questions are of great importance for the physics of spin glasses ( for reviews see @xcite )",
    ". therefore numerous dynamical extensions have been added to the sk model . following",
    "the early dynamical approaches @xcite glauber dynamics has been used by various authors @xcite .",
    "in addition , langevin dynamics has been employed in the studies @xcite mostly for the soft spin version of the sk model .",
    "both the langevin and the glauber dynamics are basically phenomenological and can at best be justified partially by microscopic arguments .",
    "note this also applies to the work of szamel @xcite although this approach is formulated in the ` spirit ' of the microscopic mori theory .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to present a compete microscopic analysis of the dynamical linear response for the sk model coupled to a bath .",
    "an adequate tool for this purpose is the general theory of mori @xcite .",
    "this quantum - statistical approach is used in the present work and is worked out not only for the sk model but for a general ising model .",
    "such a treatment is obvious and straightforward .",
    "nevertheless , to the authors knowledge it has previously not been published .",
    "as usual the results of the mori theory are expressed in terms of static equilibrium quantities . together with the static isothermal susceptibility , it is the internal field distribution function @xcite which fully determines the dynamical linear response . at this point",
    "we restrict the approach to the sk model .",
    "it is shown that the internal field distribution function can be related to the solutions of the tap equations . employing the approximate tap solutions @xcite , all the quantities of the linear response theory can be numerically calculated in the entire temperature regime for all external fields .",
    "the references @xcite showed that an exact and complete description of the thermodynamics of ising models can be formulated in terms of the internal field distribution function .",
    "thus as a byproduct the presented results of this function are of some interest independent of the dynamical linear response problems .    following a description of the microscopic hamiltonian , the mori approach for a general ising system is performed in section 2 .",
    "the internal magnetic field distribution function for the sk model is treated in section 3 . both the analytical and numerical results for the field distribution function , the dynamic susceptibility and the response function are explicitly presented in section 4 . finally , some concluding remarks can be found in section 5 .",
    "a system of @xmath0 spins @xmath1 with @xmath2 is considered in the presence of external fields @xmath3 . the spins",
    "interact via an arbitrary ising spin - spin interaction @xmath4 and are described by the spin hamiltonian @xmath5 where @xmath6 is presumed . both quantum spin @xmath7 operators @xmath8 and ising spins @xmath9 are used simultaneously in this work .",
    "note that at this stage the bonds @xmath10 are quite general .",
    "the assembly of spins is weakly coupled to a bath described by the hamiltonian @xmath11 via a spin bath interaction @xmath12 where the operators @xmath13 represent variables of the bath system .",
    "thus the total hamiltonian is given by @xmath14    there is no need for an explicit specification of the bath hamiltonian @xmath15 and the bath operators @xmath13 . as shown below it",
    "is just the absorptive part @xmath16 of the dynamic bath susceptibility @xmath17\\rangle_{(b)}\\ ; e^ { i\\omega t } \\mathrm{d}t \\quad,\\ ] ] which enters the calculation and which is assumed to be known . in equation ( [ 4 ] ) @xmath18 represents the canonical thermal expectation value with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath20 denotes the liouville operator defined by @xmath21 $ ] . for later use",
    "it is noted that @xmath16 may be rewritten as @xmath22 which can easily be shown or can be found in literature @xcite . in writing equation ( [ 4 ] ) , it is assumed that the bath susceptibilities do not depend on the site @xmath23 . this assumption is not essential and an extension to the general case is straightforward .",
    "let @xmath24 and @xmath25 be the relaxation times of the bath and the spin system respectively .",
    "then it is natural to assume a fast relaxation to thermal equilibrium for the bath system compared to the spin system which implies @xmath26 for the explicit determination of linear response quantities ( see section 4 . )",
    "the bath susceptibility @xmath16 enters for @xmath27 .",
    "this implies @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be used in the generic case for the explicit calculations of below .",
    "if the simple form @xmath30 is presumed , the constant of proportionality is given by const@xmath31 , which may in principle be temperature dependent .",
    "this dependence is neglected in this work by assuming a slow variation on scale determined by the spin glass temperature .",
    "this assumption is to a certain extent arbitrary but can be justified for special cases .",
    "such a case is the korringa mechanism , where the bath and the @xmath32 are identified as the conduction electrons and itinerant spin density operators respectively .",
    "the linear response of the magnetizations @xmath33 due to small time dependent external fields @xmath34 is governed by the dynamic susceptibility matrix @xmath35 which is given by the kubo formula written in the liouville space @xcite @xmath36 with @xmath37 . in the liouville space",
    "the operators @xmath38 of the state space are considered as vectors @xmath39 with the temperature dependent mori scalar product @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the canonical thermal expectation value with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "operators in the liouville space like the liouville operator @xmath43)\\ ] ] will be written in roman letters .",
    "are set equal to @xmath44 . ]",
    "introducing the projection operator in liouville space @xmath45 and applying the standard mori projection procedure @xcite leads to @xmath46 with @xmath47 and with @xmath48 .",
    "the matrices @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent the static isothermal susceptibility matrix and the dynamic onsager - casimir matrix respectively .",
    "note that the vectors @xmath51 which span the subspace @xmath52 commute .",
    "thus the frequency matrix vanishes in the present case .    according to the standard approach @xcite for a sufficiently weak coupling @xmath53 the markovian approximation @xmath54 can be applied in equation ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "furthermore the leading order perturbation - theory expressions can be used for both @xmath49 and @xmath55 in ( [ 16 ] ) .",
    "the static isothermal susceptibility matrix is of the order zero and approximated by @xmath56 where @xmath57 and where @xmath58 is the canonical thermal expectation value with respect to the ising hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) .    setting @xmath59",
    "the lowest order of this matrix is the second order in the perturbation and is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the liouville operators related to @xmath53 and to @xmath63 respectively .",
    "the index @xmath64 denotes the mori product taken with @xmath63 alone and the projector @xmath65 is defined with the latter mori product .",
    "the projector @xmath65 drops out , since @xmath66 commutes with @xmath63 and thus @xmath67\\rangle_{(0)}=0 $ ] holds , where in addition the second equation of ( [ 13 ] ) was used . recalling @xmath6 ,",
    "one finds that @xmath68 where the operator of the internal field @xmath69 at the site @xmath23 is given by @xmath70 using equation ( [ 20 ] ) we find @xmath71 with @xmath72 let @xmath73 be any operator in the unitary space of the spins not involving site @xmath23 . then @xmath74 can be obtained @xcite . applying this relation to equation (",
    "[ 21 ] ) and using ( [ 5 ] ) finally yields for the dynamic susceptibility matrix @xmath75 where the static isothermal susceptibility matrix @xmath49 and the internal field operators @xmath76 are given by equation ( [ 18 ] ) and by equation ( [ 201 ] ) respectively .    to complete the analytic investigations for the general ising case , the local - field probability distribution functions @xmath77 are introduced which permits the @xmath78 to be rewritten as @xmath79 from the definition the relations @xmath80 immediately result , where the last relation is based on equation ( [ 22 ] ) with @xmath81 .    with the result ( [ 231 ] ) we have found in a very compact form of the dynamic susceptibility matrix @xmath82 .",
    "this result is not restricted to the sk model and holds for all ising models . according to the equations ( [ 231 ] ) and ( [ 25 ] )",
    "the dynamic susceptibility @xmath82 can be explicitly calculated provided that the static susceptibility @xmath83 and the internal magnetic field distribution functions @xmath84 are known .",
    "knowledge of the linear dynamic susceptibility @xmath82 implies knowledge of all the other response functions .",
    "let us consider the linear relaxation functions @xmath85 which describe the linear response @xmath86\\ ; h_j^{ex } $ ] for @xmath87 due to small changes of the external fields @xmath88 . according to the general response theory @xmath89",
    "is given by @xmath90 and is approximated by @xmath91 the remaining quantity of interest in linear response theory is the response function matrix which equals @xmath92 . due to this simple relation",
    "the response function matrix is not further considered in this work .",
    "the results ( [ 29 ] ) can be compared in detail with the work of szamel @xcite which represents both the most recent and the closest treatment on the subject of this paper . comparing equation ( [ 29 ] ) for the case",
    "@xmath93 with equation ( 13 ) of the first paper of reference @xcite clearly shows that the values @xmath94 or according to relation ( [ 22 ] ) the values @xmath95 are used for the @xmath96 instead the correct values given in equation ( [ 231 ] ) .",
    "thus in general both approaches disagree .",
    "the work of szamel and other former work @xcite is based on the phenomenological glauber dynamics .",
    "microscopic derivation @xcite of this master - equation ( in the form of reference @xcite ) leads to the transition rates @xmath97 for the @xmath93 case . in the work of szamel the values for the rates @xmath98",
    "were used which can only be justified for the special , rather unrealistic case that the bath susceptibility @xmath99 is proportional to @xmath100 .",
    "thus , for a general agreement with the present approach , the correct transition rates ( [ 2000 ] ) have to be used in the master - equation treatment .",
    "microscopically unjustified rates of the form of @xcite are widely used to analyze the dynamics of ising models for various physical questions .",
    "provided the characteristic width of the distribution @xmath101 is of the order of the temperature @xmath102 or larger than @xmath102 a modified master - equation approach with the rates ( [ 2000 ] ) will lead to significant changes .",
    "note that for ( standard ) mean field treatments these effects are absent . in these cases @xmath101 is a @xmath103-function and the modifications reduce to a factor which can be eliminated by scaling the time . for the spin glasses at low temperatures ,",
    "however , the exact form of the transition rates is essential , as worked out in the following for the sk model .",
    "for the rest of the paper we consider exclusively the special case of the sk model . in this case",
    "the bonds @xmath104 are independent random variables with zero means and standard deviations @xmath105 .",
    "this scaling fixes the spin glass temperature to @xmath106 .",
    "the smallness and the randomness enter basically into the approach of this section where a tractable form for the field distribution @xmath107 of the sk model is deduced .",
    "this approach uses techniques similar to the derivations of the tap equations @xcite .",
    "the spin hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) is rewritten as @xmath108 where @xmath109 describes a @xmath110 spin system with the spin @xmath111 removed from the original spin system . using the relation @xmath112=\\delta(h - h_i - x_i ) \\exp(\\beta h s_i)$ ] and the fourier representation of the @xmath103-function and taking the trace over the site @xmath23 @xmath113 is obtained .",
    "the partition function of the original spin system is denoted by @xmath114 and @xmath115 stands for the trace of the @xmath116 spin system .",
    "the quantity @xmath117 represents a partition function of the @xmath116 spin system in presence of additional imaginary fields @xmath118 . due to the smallness of the @xmath104 the cumulant expansion",
    "can be performed which yields to leading order in @xmath119 @xcite @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the local magnetizations and the static susceptibilities of the @xmath116 spin system respectively .",
    "following again the former approaches @xcite the double sum in equation ( [ 41 ] ) is replaced by the local static susceptibility @xmath123 with the result ( [ 41 ] ) the integration in equation ( [ 40 ] ) can be performed yielding @xmath124 where the factors independent of @xmath125 are determined from the normalization condition @xmath126 and where the local effective field @xmath127 was introduced .",
    "the latter two relations of equation ( [ 27 ] ) yield @xmath128 which is employed to rewrite equation ( [ 43 ] ) as function of @xmath129 and @xmath130 @xmath131    note that equation ( [ 44 ] ) are the well known tap equations if the local static susceptibility @xmath132 is specified . in this work the modified version @xcite of these equations",
    "is used which yields @xmath133 with @xmath134 as worked out in @xcite , for the stable states the modified tap equations are equivalent to the original ones in the thermodynamic limit and differences result only for unstable states . for finite systems the complete temperature and field dependence of the solutions of the modified equations",
    "is known @xcite , in contrast to the original tap equations .    with the knowledge of these solutions the total internal field distribution function defined as @xmath135 can be calculated according to equation ( [ 43 ] ) or ( [ 45 ] ) . in zero field above the spin glass temperature the distribution function reduces to @xmath136 the latter result for the special case has already been obtained by thomsen @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of the authors knowledge , the general results of this section have previously not been published .",
    "the static properties of ising models can entirely be formulated in terms of the internal field distribution function @xmath137 @xcite . due to this general importance",
    "some discussion of @xmath137 for the sk model is presented .",
    "temperature dependence of the internal field distribution function @xmath137 of the sk spin glass for temperatures @xmath138 below and above the spin - glass temperature @xmath106 for zero external field . ]    for zero magnetic field the temperature dependence of @xmath139 is shown in figure ( [ f1 ] ) . above the spin- glass temperature @xmath106 the exact result ( [ 50 ] )",
    "is plotted . below the spin glass temperature",
    "the figure is based on equation ( [ 45 ] ) and on the numerical results of @xcite . in the plot",
    "the local magnetizations @xmath140 for the state of lowest free energy of a n=225 system ( sample i ) are used . on the scale of figure ( [ f1 ] ) both regimes @xmath141 and @xmath142",
    "fit smoothly together .",
    "the distribution function @xmath139 bifurcates from a one - peak structure to a two - peak structure at the spin - glass temperature .",
    "with decreasing temperature the minimum located at @xmath143 becomes deeper and finally reaches the value @xmath144 for zero temperature within numeric precision .",
    "this behavior also applies to the metastable states .",
    "moreover the variations for the different states are small and seem to become negligible in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is remarkable and is an indication for self averaging of @xmath101 .",
    "these findings , as well as the general temperature dependence of @xmath101 , are in agreement with monte - carlo simulations of references @xcite .",
    "temperature dependence of internal field distribution function @xmath137 of the sk spin glass in presence of a homogenous external field h=0.5 .",
    "the ( numerical ) at temperature is t=.577 . ]",
    "the discussion is completed by figure ( [ f2 ] ) where @xmath101 is shown for a system with a homogenous external field @xmath145 .",
    "no exact results are known for this case and thus the plot is based on numerical data everywhere .",
    "again the data of sample i of reference @xcite are used .",
    "now the distribution @xmath146 is asymmetric but again a bifurcation to a two - peak structure is found when the spin glass regime is entered .",
    "this occurs at the almeida - thouless ( at ) temperature @xcite which is determined from @xmath147 and which leads to the numerical value of @xmath148 for the sample under consideration .",
    "these results indicate that the spin glass regime is also characterized by a two - peak structure of @xmath137 for the case where a finite external field is present .    certainly in the numerical results",
    "finite - size effects are present .",
    "the most obvious feature is the asymmetry of @xmath139 in figure ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "thus the investigations of the finite - size effects @xcite are extended to the distribution function @xmath101 and averages over a few tens of independent samples are performed keeping @xmath149 and @xmath102 fixed . for the averages",
    "the asymmetry of @xmath101 for the case @xmath150 reduces both with increasing number of samples and with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "this represents some numerical evidence that the asymmetry is indeed an artifact due to the finite system size .    in this context",
    "we recall that in zero magnetic field for each solution of the tap equation ( [ 44 ] ) a further solution can be constructed trivially by changing the sign of all @xmath140 .",
    "according to equation ( [ 43 ] ) the distributions corresponding to these two solutions are given by @xmath139 and by @xmath151 respectively .",
    "the means of these two distributions exhibit considerable smaller sample - to - sample variations than the individual @xmath139 .",
    "this can in principle be used to construct improved approximations of @xmath139 for the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the tap approach , however , does not use any averaging and thus we avoid this procedure . moreover the asymmetry of figure ( [ f1 ] ) indicates the order of magnitude of the finite - size effects .",
    "we focus on the local dynamic susceptibility which is defined as @xmath152 and which is a quantity of both theoretical and experimental interest . employing the results of the last subsection and the approximation ( [ 7 ] ) ( setting const=@xmath153 which fixes the time scale )",
    "the onsager coefficient @xmath78 can be numerically determined according to equation ( [ 25 ] ) . furthermore using the well known expression for the static isothermal susceptibility @xmath154^{-1}+ \\chi_l\\big\\}\\;\\delta_{ij } - j_{ij}\\ ] ] with @xmath132 given by the equations ( [ 46]-[48 ] ) , all terms of equation ( [ 231 ] )",
    "are explicitly known and the dynamic susceptibility matrix @xmath155 is obtained by numerical matrix inversion . from this",
    "the local susceptibility @xmath156 is finally calculated .",
    "a further method exists to determine @xmath156 which is based on the theorem of pastur @xcite .. such a generalization can be easily be added to the method of bray and moore @xcite . ]",
    "this theorem immediately leads to the identity ( compare @xcite ) @xmath157^{-1 } + \\chi_l - i \\omega ( \\beta l_{ii})^{-1}-\\chi_l(\\omega)\\big\\}^{-1}\\ ] ] and @xmath156 is obtained as a solution of equation ( [ 82 ] ) satisfying @xmath158 . in the paramagnetic regime and in absence of external magnetic fields",
    "this equation leads to the analytic result @xmath159 where the onsager coefficient @xmath160 is temperature dependent and given by @xmath161 using the equations ( [ 25 ] ) and ( [ 50 ] ) .",
    "note that for @xmath162 equation ( [ 83 ] ) reduces to @xmath163 which implies a relaxation time proportional to @xmath164 , as is the case for the korringa relaxation of single magnetic moments dissolved in a metal .",
    "note further that the result ( [ 83 ] ) partially agrees with the work of kinzel and fischer @xcite who , however , have not obtained the temperature dependence of @xmath165 . near the spin glass temperature",
    "both approaches agree and yield @xmath166 at @xmath167 .    with reference to the definition of @xmath168 @xcite @xmath169 results from equation ( [ 82 ] ) .",
    "thus the quantities @xmath130 and @xmath170 , which enter formally in derivation the modified tap equations , are related to the real and the imaginary part of the isolated susceptibility @xmath171 .",
    "recalling that there are frequently situations in physics where the isolated and the isothermal susceptibility differ ( for some general discussion see @xcite ) this result gives some additional insight into approach leading to the modified tap equations @xcite .",

    "the two different methods lead to similar results but deviate increasingly for small frequencies @xmath182 .",
    "it is remarkable that the results of figure ( [ f34 ] ) show some overall similarity to real , experimental data @xcite .",
    "one of these features is the frequency dependence of the cusp temperature of @xmath183 . in the present approach",
    "the shift results simply from the temperature dependence of the onsager coefficients .",
    "the deviations appearing in figure ( [ f34 ] ) for small frequencies are caused by the finite - size of the system . according to equation ( [ 231 ] )",
    "@xmath50 is positive definite .",
    "thus the matrix @xmath184 is well defined and @xmath185 can be rewritten as @xmath186 .",
    "use of the diagonal representation of @xmath187 leads to @xmath188 which shows that @xmath156 can be written as a superposition of lorenzian functions with relaxation rates @xmath189 given by the eigenvalues of @xmath190 . in the spin glass regime the minimum value @xmath191 of all rates @xmath192",

    "the plot clearly exhibits the slowing down at the spin glass temperature and the presence of the slow dynamics in the spin glass regime . comparing the numerical and the analytical results above the spin glass temperature the deviations increase for the long time behavior when approaching the spin glass regime .",
    "as discussed already above , these finite - size effects result from the finite value of @xmath204 and limits the numerical results to the region @xmath205 near and below the spin glass temperature .",
    "two questions are studied from a more general point of view in the present work .",
    "first of all the linear response theory for an arbitrary ising model which is microscopically and weakly coupled to a bath is investigated using the theory of mori and applying the standard approximations .",
    "this approach seems to be natural and conservative and could have been carried out some decades ago .",
    "nevertheless the results are remarkable , as the entire dynamical response of any ising model is completely determined by the internal field distribution function , by the static isothermal susceptibility and - as the only characteristic feature of bath - by a bath dynamic susceptibility . due to the simple structure this part of the present work may be of interest for other models than the sk model .",
    "the relation to former approaches has been worked out in some detail at the end of section 2 .",
    "it is the use of microscopically unjustified transition rates in these master - equations which causes the differences to the present investigation .",
    "the second question is exclusively related to the sk model and represents the study of the internal field distribution function showing how this function is related to the solutions of the tap equations .",
    "the relationship obtained opens the possibility of explicitly calculating further quantities of interest for the sk model , such as the inelastic - neutron - scattering cross section @xcite .",
    "a further tool to obtain the final results for the dynamic linear response functions of the sk model is the explicit knowledge of the solutions of the modified tap equations .",
    "this again demonstrates the importance of the modified tap approach .",
    "the present work is limited to the dynamics in linear approximation near the thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "it is , however , well known that in the physics of spin glasses nonlinear dynamical effects and the linear response in out of equilibrium situations are of great importance @xcite .",
    "thus an extension of the present microscopic approach to nonlinear dynamics would be of great use to treat these effects on a well - founded bases .",

    "<S> the dynamic linear response theory of a general ising model weakly coupled to a heat bath is derived employing the quantum statistical theory of mori , treating the hamiltonian of the spin bath coupling as a perturbation , and applying the markovian approximation . </S>",
    "<S> both the dynamic susceptibility and the relaxation function are expressed in terms of the static susceptibility and the static internal field distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> for the special case of the sk spin glass this internal field distribution can be related to the solutions of the tap equations in the entire temperature region . </S>",
    "<S> application of this new relation and the use of numerical solutions of the modified tap equations leads for finite but large systems to explicit results for the distribution function and for dynamic linear response functions . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed discussion is presented which includes finite - size effects . due to the derived temperature dependence of the onsager - casimir coefficients a frequency - dependent shift of the cusp temperature of the real part of the dynamic susceptibility </S>",
    "<S> is found . </S>"
