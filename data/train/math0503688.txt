    "homotopy continuation methods provide reliable and efficient numerical algorithms to compute accurate approximations to all isolated solutions of polynomial systems , see e.g.  @xcite for a recent survey . as proposed in  @xcite",
    ", we can approximate a positive dimensional solution set of a polynomial system by isolated solutions , which are obtained as intersection points of the set with a generic linear space of complementary dimension .",
    "new homotopy algorithms have been developed in a series of papers  @xcite to give numerical representations of positive dimensional solution sets of polynomial systems .",
    "these homotopies are the main numerical algorithms in a young field we call _ numerical algebraic geometry_. see  @xcite for a detailed treatment of this subject .",
    "this paper provides an algorithm to compute numerical approximations to positive dimensional solution sets of polynomial systems by introducing the equations one at a time .",
    "the advantage of working in this manner is that the special properties of individual equations are revealed early in the process , thus reducing the computational cost of later stages .",
    "consequently , although the new algorithm has more stages of computation than earlier approaches , the amount of work in each stage can be considerably less , producing a net savings in computing time .",
    "this paper is organized in three parts .",
    "first we explain our method to represent and to compute a numerical irreducible decomposition of the solution set of a polynomial system . in the third section",
    ", new diagonal homotopy algorithms will be applied to solve systems subsystem by subsystem or equation by equation .",
    "computational experiments are given in the fourth section .",
    "we start this section with a motivating illustrative example , which shows the occurrence of several solution sets , of different dimensions and degrees .",
    "secondly , we define the notion of witness sets , which we developed to represent pure dimensional solution sets of polynomial systems _",
    "numerically_. witness sets are computed by cascades of homotopies between embeddings of polynomial systems .",
    "our running example ( used also in  @xcite ) is the following :    @xmath0.\\ ] ]    in this factored form we can easily identify the decomposition of the solution set @xmath1 into irreducible solution components , as follows : @xmath2 where    [ cols= \" < \" , ]",
    "the recent invention of the diagonal homotopy allows one to compute intersections between algebraic sets represented numerically by witness sets .",
    "this opens up many new possibilities for ways to manipulate algebraic sets numerically .",
    "in particular , one may solve a system of polynomial equations by first solving subsets of the equations and then intersecting the results .",
    "we have presented a subsystem - by - subsystem algorithm based on this idea , which when carried to extreme gives an equation - by - equation algorithm .",
    "the approach can generate witness sets for all the solution components of a system , or it can be specialized to only seek the nonsingular solutions at the lowest dimension . applying this latter form to a system of @xmath3 equations in @xmath3 variables ,",
    "we come full circle in the sense that we are using methods developed to deal with higher dimensional solution sets as a means of finding just the isolated solutions .",
    "experiments with a few simple systems indicates that the method can be very effective . using only the total degrees of the equations",
    ", the method numerically discovers some of their inherent structure in the early stages of the computation .",
    "these early stages are relatively cheap and they can sometimes eliminate much of the computation that would otherwise be incurred in the final stages .    in future work , we plan to exercise the approach on more challenging problems , especially ones where the equations have interrelationships that are not easily revealed just by examining the monomials that appear .",
    "multihomogenous homotopies and polyhedral homotopies are only able to take advantage of that sort of structure , while the equation - by - equation approach can reveal structure encoded in the coefficients of the polynomials .",
    "one avenue of further research could be to seek a formulation that uses multihomogeneous homotopies or polyhedral homotopies in an equation - by - equation style to get the best of both worlds .",
