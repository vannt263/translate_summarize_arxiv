    "establishing the existence of non constant bounded solutions to parameter dependent systems of reaction - diffusion pdes is a classical problem in nonlinear analysis .",
    "methods like singular perturbation theory @xcite , local bifurcation theory ( see @xcite and the references therein ) , the local theory of crandall and rabinowitz @xcite , and the leray - schauder degree theory can be used to prove existence of such non constant solutions .",
    "however , it appears difficult in practice to use such results to answer specific questions about the solutions , e.g. determining the number of ( or a lower bound on the number of ) non constant co - existing steady states .",
    "if the parameter dependent system under study undergoes a bifurcation from a trivial solution , it also appears difficult to determine rigorously the behaviour of the solutions on the global bifurcating branches .",
    "the global bifurcation theorem of rabinowitz @xcite , although powerful and general , can convey only partial information about the global behaviour of the branches .    while the development of theoretical knowledge about existence of solutions of systems of pdes is slow , meticulous and often hard to grasp for non experts , there exist several user friendly bifurcation softwares that can efficiently produce tremendous amount of bounded approximate solutions .",
    "however , with any numerical methods , there is the question of validity of the outputs .",
    "the goal of this paper is to propose , in the context of studying non constant steady states for systems of pdes , a rigorous computational method in an attempt to fill the gap between the above mentioned theoretical and computational advances .",
    "more specifically , we compute rigorously a global bifurcation diagram of steady states for the 3-component reaction - diffusion system arising in population dynamics introduced in @xcite , and given by    @xmath1    where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are defined for @xmath5 , @xmath6 $ ] with neumann boundary conditions and with the following fixed numerical values @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we consider the diffusion @xmath16 as a free parameter .",
    "the above choice of fixed parameter values is chosen so that , when the parameter @xmath16 varies , turing s instability ( e.g. @xcite ) can be observed .",
    "more precisely , varying the diffusion @xmath16 can destabilize the constant steady state solution given by @xmath17 , which is stable for the corresponding finite dimensional ode model without diffusion terms .",
    "hence , by changing the diffusion @xmath16 , interesting non trivial bounded stationary patterns can arise as a result of turing s instability , which is one of the most important mechanisms of pattern formation .",
    "note that considering a 3-component reaction - diffusion system allows having turing instability with quadratic reaction terms , as opposed to the standard cubic case .",
    "a nice consequence of this choice of system is that the nonlinear terms are easier to estimate than in the cubic case .",
    "the system of pdes has been introduced in @xcite with the goal of studying the ( theoretically harder to study ) cross - diffusion model for the competitive interaction between two species @xmath18 + ( r_1-a_1 u_1 -b_1 u_2 ) u_1 ,     \\\\          & \\partial_t u_2 ( \\xi , t ) = \\delta [ ( d_2+\\beta u_1)u_2 ]   + ( r_2-b_2u_1-a_2 u_2)u_2 ,     \\\\        \\end{aligned }      \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath19 are defined for @xmath5 , @xmath6 $ ] , and satisfy neumann boundary conditions . as already mentioned in @xcite , model falls into quasi - linear parabolic systems so that even the existence problem of solutions is not trivial and has been investigated by several authors ( e.g. see @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that the solutions of can be approximated by those of in a finite time interval if the solutions are bounded and provided @xmath20 is small enough .",
    "it is also proved in @xcite that the steady states of the reaction - diffusion system approximates the steady states of the cross - diffusion system as @xmath20 goes to @xmath21 .",
    "hence , developing a rigorous computational approach to prove existence of non constant steady states of seems to be an interesting problem , as it may shed some light on how to rigorously study non constant steady states of a cross - diffusion model ( see theorem  [ thm : cross_diffusion ] ) .",

    "[ thm : bif_diagram ] except in small neighborhoods of the bifurcations , each point in figure  [ japonais ] represents exactly one steady state for , each curve on the diagram is smooth and between the apparent bifurcations ( in black dots ) , there are no secondary bifurcations of steady states .",

    ", we will be looking for solutions @xmath43 of @xmath44 in a banach space of fast decaying coefficients .",
    "let us be more explicit about this .",
    "as in @xcite , we define weight functions ( @xmath45 ) @xmath46 which are used to define , for @xmath47 as defined above , the norm    @xmath48    where @xmath45 is a decay rate and @xmath49 .",
    "define @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a constant whose value will be chosen later , and @xmath52 , a banach space with norm of sequences decreasing to zero at least as fast as @xmath53 , as @xmath54 .",

    "assume that @xmath58 is a solution of @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath59 is a banach algebra for @xmath60 ( see section  [ estimes ] ) , then one can use a bootstrap argument ( e.g. like the one in section  [ sec : bootstrap ] ) with the fact that @xmath61 for any @xmath62 $ ] to get that @xmath63 , for every @xmath64 . by construction of @xmath65",

    "hence , the fourier coefficients of @xmath23 decrease faster than any algebraic decay , which implies that @xmath68 , for all @xmath45 .    hence , based on the result of lemma  [ lemma : equivalence ] , we focus our attention on finding @xmath68 such that @xmath44 , for a fixed @xmath55 . to find the zeros of @xmath65 ,",
    "the idea is the following .",

    "first , it is defined so that the zeros of @xmath65 are in one - to - one correspondence with the fixed points of @xmath72 , that is @xmath44 if and only if @xmath73 .",
    "second , it is constructed as a newton - like operator around the numerical approximation @xmath74 .",
    "the final and most involved step is to look for the existence of a set @xmath75 centered at @xmath74 which contains a genuine zero of the nonlinear operator @xmath65 .",
    "the idea to perform such task is to find @xmath75 such that @xmath76 is a contraction , and to use the contraction mapping theorem to conclude about the existence of a unique fixed point of @xmath72 within @xmath77 .",
    "the method used to find @xmath77 is based on the notion of the radii polynomials , which provide an efficient means of finding a set on which the contraction mapping can be applied @xcite .",
    "we refer to section  [ sec : uniform_contraction ] for the definition of the radii polynomials and to section  [ i ] for their explicit construction .",
    "the polynomials are used to find ( if possible ) an @xmath78 such that @xmath72 is a contraction on the closed ball @xmath79 of radius @xmath80 and centered at @xmath74 in @xmath81 , for @xmath82 . with this norm ,",

    "the idea is to construct radii polynomials defined in terms of both @xmath80 and @xmath88 and to apply the uniform contraction principle . with this construction , it is possible to prove existence of smooth global solution curves of @xmath70 .",
    "see section  [ sec : uniform_contraction ] for more details .    before proceeding further",
    ", it is worth mentioning that the method proposed in the present work is strongly influenced by the method based on the radii polynomials introduced in @xcite and the rigorous branch following method of @xcite .",
    "there are however some differences .",
    "first , prior to the present work , the method based on the radii polynomials has never been applied to systems of reaction - diffusion pdes .",
    "second , new convolution estimates are introduced in section  [ estimes ] for a new range of decay rates , that is for @xmath89 .",
    "the importance of these new estimates is that they can improve the success rate of the proofs while reduce significantly the computational time .",
    "indeed , it is demonstrated in section  [ sec : q ] that using @xmath90 can greatly improve the efficiency of the rigorous method based on the radii polynomials .",
    "also in section  [ sec : q ] , a detailed analysis of the optimal choice of the decay rate parameter @xmath45 is made , where the goal is to maximize the chances of performing successfully the computational proofs .",
    "note that prior to the present work , the method based on the radii polynomials has only used decay rates @xmath91 .",
    "third , the method here is slightly different from the approach of @xcite for the construction of global branches in the sense that it is a _ gluing - free _ approach .",
    "more precisely , it means that no extra work has to be made to glue together adjacent small pieces of smooth curves ( see theorem  [ th_rec ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that here , a global @xmath92 piecewise linear numerical approximation of the curve is constructed , while in @xcite , the global representation of the curve is piecewise linear but not @xmath92 .",
    "let us present a consequence of theorem  [ thm : bif_diagram ] .",
    "this result could be hard to prove with a purely analytic approach .",

    "ten of these solutions are non constant.,width=302 ]    the following result may be a step toward rigorously studying steady states of the cross - diffusion model .",
    "its proof is omitted since similar to the proof of theorem  [ thm : bif_diagram ] .",
    "[ thm : cross_diffusion ] fix @xmath94 . for each @xmath95 , there exist a non - trivial steady state solution @xmath96 of the reaction - diffusion system",
    ". see figure  [ epsilon ] for a representation .",
    "[ h ]     +    the solutions in figure  [ epsilon ] are rigorously computed using the method presented in this paper .",
    "in fact the computation uses a simpler version of the method because the proofs of existence are only done at discrete values of the parameters . as can be seen in table  [ table : esp_convergence ] , there is apparent convergence as @xmath20 goes to zero .",
    "the @xmath97 bounds there are rigorous because we control through @xmath98 ( the radius of the ball ) the error we have made with the numerical approximations . according to the work of @xcite , the solution on figure  [ 10 ^ -5 ] given by @xmath99 when @xmath100 should be close to a solution of the cross - diffusion system .    .apparent convergence of the rigorously computed steady states of the 3-component reaction - diffusion system toward a steady state of the cross - diffusion system . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +     +    what we see with these comparisons is that , on the red branch of figure  [ a1 ] , taking @xmath101 smaller allows using a greater @xmath102 but at the expense of a greater @xmath103 .",
    "hence , a better compromise seems to be somewhere between @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "but it seems that when @xmath16 becomes small , it could also be better to take @xmath101 smaller in order to use a smaller @xmath103 ( see the case @xmath106 on figure  [ compb1 ] ) .",
    "let us see how this evolves when @xmath16 becomes even smaller .",
    "note that we were able to get the rigorous data ( for different values of @xmath101 ) of table  [ fig : computational_cost ] and of figure  [ fig : ds_m_as_functions_of_q ] because the rigorous computations of the concerned branches did not take too long .",
    "however for some other curves , the proof takes much longer , mainly because @xmath16 gets smaller and hence @xmath103 must be taken larger for the coefficients @xmath107 of the last radii polynomial ( [ bqueue ] ) to be negative . on the other hand , it only takes one point along the branch to determine , given @xmath101 , which value of @xmath103 should be taken in order to make @xmath107 negative .",
    "also , the cost of the proof decreases linearly with @xmath102 but increases quadratically with @xmath103 , so it seems fair to chose @xmath101 according to @xmath103 only and independently of @xmath102 for those branches where @xmath103 has to be taken large . in figure  [ complet ] , we present some non rigorous results concerning the second part of the second branch .",
    "although non rigorous , these results helps understanding the role played by @xmath101 for the computational cost of the method .",
    "we can see in figure  [ q_opt1 ] that as the diffusion parameter @xmath16 decreases , the optimal decay rate @xmath101 becomes smaller as well .",
    "that can be explained by the fact that the coefficient @xmath107 of the last radii polynomial is non negative if @xmath108 is taken too small .",
    "a necessary condition for @xmath107 to be negative is roughly the following @xmath109 which shows why @xmath110 has to be taken larger when @xmath16 becomes smaller . but to understand the impact of @xmath101 , we have to detail how the values of @xmath111 and @xmath112 evolve with @xmath101 . for this",
    "let us recall the definitions of @xmath113 in ( [ norme ] ) and of @xmath111 in ( [ def_alpha ] ) and let us look at the shape of the solution @xmath114 .",
    "for instance , we see on figure  [ spatial1 ] that on the first branch the solutions are almost sinusoids of period @xmath115 and hence @xmath116 . hence ,",
    "taking @xmath101 smaller does not decrease the value of @xmath113 , but it increases slightly @xmath111 , and then finally leads to a greater @xmath103 .",
    "however , when @xmath16 becomes smaller , the high frequencies in the solutions are more and more important .",
    "thus @xmath112 involves @xmath117 for some @xmath118 and hence taking @xmath101 smaller decreases significantly the value of @xmath113 and therefore the value of @xmath119 .",
    "this allows taking a smaller @xmath103 , provided that @xmath101 is not too small .",
    "indeed , @xmath120 increases more than @xmath112 decreases when @xmath101 gets close to @xmath121 , which explains why the optimal value of @xmath101 seems not to go below @xmath122 .",
    "one can see in figure  [ q_opt1 ] that when @xmath16 is really small , the value of @xmath103 is far much smaller with @xmath123 than with @xmath105 .",
    "this is a significant improvement , especially in terms of the computational cost which evolves in @xmath124 . actually , we did some computation , and the cost of the proof to do part of a branch for small @xmath16 is about @xmath125 times faster with @xmath126 than with @xmath105 .",
    "this brings us to the conclusion that the new estimates introduced in section  [ estimes ] for @xmath127 can be quite useful .",
    "actually , they allowed proving parts of some branches in figure  [ complet ] which we would not have been able to do with @xmath105 .",
    "+     +     +     +",
    "recall and fix @xmath128 . set @xmath129 in the bounds of lemma  [ n > m ] and set @xmath130 in those of lemma  [ n < m ] . set the multiplicative coefficient used to change @xmath102 equal to @xmath131 and the one used to change @xmath103 equal to @xmath132 .",
    "that means that in the algorithm of section  [ sec : algorithm ] , taking @xmath102 larger means setting @xmath133 , taking @xmath102 smaller means setting @xmath134 , taking @xmath103 larger means setting @xmath135 and taking @xmath103 smaller means setting @xmath136 .",
    "we proved that in a small tube ( whose size is given by @xmath80 ) of each portion of curve represented in figure  [ japonais ] between two bifurcation points , there exists a unique smooth curve representing exactly one steady states of ( [ eq : mimura_system ] ) .",
    "note that the method can not prove that those curves really reach the bifurcation points , but we can virtually go as close as we want to those bifurcation points , the only limit being the computational cost . on the other hand , applying the result of corollary  [ corollary : jinvertible ] , we can conclude that along the rigorously computed smooth branches , there are no secondary bifurcation of steady states . in table",
    "[ fig : computational_cost ] , figure  [ fig : ds_m_as_functions_of_q ] and figure  [ espace1 ] , one has some example of the parameters used , the running time required to compute the branches and some spatial representations of solutions on different branches .",
    "consider one portion of branch we have proven .",
    "we have the existence of a smooth function @xmath137 ( defined on @xmath24 $ ] ) parametrising our portion of curve , and we know that it lies in a _ tube _ of radius @xmath80 around our numerical solution .",
    "so we know the initial point and the final point with a precision of @xmath80 in @xmath82",
    ". in particular , if @xmath138 ( respectively @xmath139 ) is the numerical value of @xmath16 from which the branch starts ( respectively at which the branch finishes ) then there exists a @xmath140 in @xmath141}$ ] and a @xmath142 in @xmath143}$ ] such that @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "thus , if the branch we are considering is such that @xmath146 or reversely @xmath147 then the intermediate value theorem yields the existence of an @xmath88 in @xmath148 such that @xmath149 . notice that if @xmath93 is too close to @xmath138 or @xmath150 for those hypothesis to be satisfied , you just have to consider several consecutive portions of curve rather than a single one .",
    "on the diagram we proved , there are eleven such portions ( see figure  [ fig10 ] ) . to complete our proof , we need to check that each solution is different from one another , and we are able to do this because the radius @xmath80 we get in our proofs are small enough .",
    "remember that what we are representing on our bifurcation diagram is the value of @xmath31 at @xmath21 and that @xmath151 besides we know that @xmath152 so @xmath153 in fact , the quantity @xmath154 is the one we represented on the diagram , and so the error we did by using this representation is bounded by @xmath155[0ex]{def}}}}{=}\\,}r\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n^q}\\right).\\ ] ] with the value of @xmath101 we used and the @xmath80 we got , those @xmath156 were always smaller than @xmath157 and hence the error we made are in fact lying in thickness of the line on the diagram , so we are sure that we have eleven different solutions .",
    "what we have already proven in the proof of proposition  [ alpha ] in ( [ lim ] ) is that , for all @xmath159 and @xmath160 @xmath161 and since we needed a uniform bound , we took @xmath162 .",
    "since @xmath163 , we would like to take @xmath103 and hence @xmath108 larger to improve the estimate , but the point of getting a sharp estimate is to allow us to take @xmath103 smaller , so this does not really make sense .",
    "however , there is a way to rigorously compute a bound that is almost optimal , without increasing @xmath103 .",
