    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) electron transport in semiconductor heterostructures has provided a rich venue for the study of electron interaction physics , exhibiting such exotic states as the fractional quantum hall liquid@xcite . here",
    "strong interactions , induced by a large perpendicular magnetic field , stabilize this non - fermi liquid state . recently",
    ", much attention in the field has focused upon dilute 2d systems , which are characterized by large ratios of carrier interaction energy to kinetic energy ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "these systems exhibit an anomalous metalliclike behavior and an apparent metal - insulator transition@xcite , contradictory to the scaling theory of localization@xcite . to date , the origin of the metallic behavior is unclear , with several fundamental questions regarding this regime still unanswered . among the most important of these",
    "are the nature of the many - body correlations and screening properties in this dilute limit .",
    "to gain insight into both of these issues , we have performed frictional drag measurements .",
    "drag measurement@xcite allows one to directly study carrier - carrier interactions .",
    "these experiments are performed , on double layer systems , by driving a current ( @xmath3 ) in one layer , and measuring the potential ( @xmath4 ) , which arises in the other layer due to momentum transfer .",
    "the drag resistivity ( @xmath5 ) , given by @xmath6 , is directly proportional to the interlayer carrier - carrier scattering rate .",
    "furthermore , the layer spacing ( @xmath7 ) dependence of the drag provides a powerful probe of both the interlayer correlations and the screening properties , which exist in the system .",
    "any change in either of these properties will manifest itself in the layer spacing dependence of the drag .",
    "recently , the drag was measured between low density hole systems@xcite , with @xmath8 approximately ranging from 10 to 20@xcite . in this regime , @xmath5 showed a 2 to 3 orders of magnitude enhancement over the theory for weakly interacting systems@xcite , and the corresponding low density electron results@xcite .",
    "in addition , an anomalous temperature ( @xmath1 ) dependence , which could not be explained in light of previously studied drag processes , was observed , with @xmath5 exhibiting a greater than @xmath0 dependence at low temperatures . upon further increase of @xmath1 , a crossover to a weaker than @xmath0 dependence was observed .",
    "it was proposed that these deviations arose from many - body correlations in such a strongly interacting regime@xcite .    in this article , we study the density , temperature , and layer separation dependence of the drag between strongly interacting 2d hole systems , in the vicinity of the apparent metal - insulator transition . using this data , we show that the deviations from the @xmath0 dependence of the drag are not a result of a phonon mediated drag process@xcite , but rather arise from a novel mechanism related to the large @xmath8 value of the system .",
    "we find these deviations to be independent of layer spacing , implying that they arise from an intralayer correlation effect .",
    "furthermore , we find that the deviations to the @xmath0 dependence of the drag are correlated with the metalliclike @xmath1 dependence in the single layer resistivity , suggesting that both anomalies have the same origin .",
    "our layer spacing dependence data imply that while the screening properties in this regime remain relatively independent of temperature , they weaken significantly as the carrier density is reduced towards the metal - insulator transition .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that the coulomb drag effect itself can significantly enhance the metallic @xmath1 dependence in the single layer resistivity .",
    "four different samples were used in this study .",
    "each sample contains a double quantum well structure , consisting of two si doped p - type gaas quantum wells separated by a pure alas barrier@xcite , which was grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a ( 311)a gaas substrate .",
    "sample a , which was used in an earlier study@xcite , has an average grown layer density and center to center layer separation of @xmath9 @xmath10 and 300  , respectively .",
    "samples b and c were similar to sample a , with the exception of having different center to center layer separations of 225 and 450  , respectively .",
    "sample d was a higher density sample , having an average grown layer density and center to center layer separation of @xmath11 @xmath10 and 275  , respectively .",
    "explicit details of the parameters for each of these four samples are listed in table i. the samples were processed allowing independent contact to each of the two layers , using a selective depletion scheme@xcite .",
    "in addition , both layer densities are independently tunable using evaporated metallic gates .",
    ".[tab1 ] sample parameters .",
    "mobilities quoted at 300 mk . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the data presented in this paper were obtained using @xmath12he and dilution refrigerators . the densities in each layer",
    "were determined by independently measuring shubnikov - de haas oscillations .",
    "drive currents between 50 pa to 10 na were passed , in the [ @xmath1333 ] direction , through one of the layers , while the drag signal was measured in the other layer , using standard lock - in techniques at 4 hz . to ensure that no spurious sources were contributing to our signal , all the standard consistency checks associated with the drag technique were performed@xcite .",
    "we begin our presentation of the data by first looking at the temperature dependence of the drag in the dilute regime at different layer spacings .",
    "this is presented in fig .",
    "[ 1 ] , where we plot @xmath14 vs @xmath1 at matched densities ( @xmath15 ) of @xmath9 @xmath10 , for @xmath16 225 , 300 , and 450  . for clarity",
    ", the data from the @xmath16 450   sample has been multiplied by a factor of 6.5 .",
    "the error bar shown for the @xmath16 225   data is due to a small interlayer leakage contribution .",
    "note that both the @xmath16 225 and 450   samples exhibit the same qualitative behavior , showing a peak in @xmath14 vs @xmath1 , as was reported earlier@xcite at @xmath16 300  .",
    "in addition , the peak position in @xmath14 vs @xmath1 , marked by the dashed line , appears to be independent of layer separation .",
    "although not shown here , we also observed this at lower densities .    before discussing this data",
    ", we would like to show that these deviations from the @xmath0 dependence are not a result of a phonon mediated drag process@xcite .",
    "it has been well established that a contribution from @xmath17 phonon exchange to the drag will produce deviations from the expected @xmath0 dependence , which are qualitatively similar to those shown in fig 1 .",
    "however , the fractional deviation from @xmath0 arising from a phonon mediated process should decrease considerably as @xmath7 is reduced .",
    "this stems from the fact that as @xmath7 is reduced , the direct coulomb component of the drag increases significantly , whereas the phonon mediated component increases with a much weaker @xmath7 dependence@xcite . the data in fig 1 .",
    "show that the fractional deviation from @xmath0 is roughly independent of @xmath7 . here , at all three layer spacings , @xmath14 changes roughly 25 to 30 % , from 0.5 to 2.0 k.    furthermore , to conclusively rule out the phonon mediated process , we present the relative density dependence of the drag at @xmath16 300  , in inset ( a ) of fig .  [ 2 ] . here we have measured @xmath5 as a function of one layer density ( @xmath18 ) , while keeping the other layer density fixed at @xmath19 @xmath10 .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the phonon mediated component of the drag is strongly suppressed as the layer densities are mismatched@xcite . if @xmath17 phonon exchange contributes to the drag in our samples , one would expect to see some signature of a local maximum at matched density in these density ratio measurements .",
    "however , as shown in the inset , where @xmath5 is plotted on log - log scale against @xmath18 at both @xmath20 80 and 300 mk , the drag exhibits no signature of a local maximum at matched density , and is described by a linear fit with slope close to -2.5 , implying @xmath21 at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "the deviation from the fit at low density in the 300 mk trace is a consequence of the density dependent crossover in the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath5@xcite .    to provide yet further evidence against the presence of @xmath22 phonon exchange in our samples , we have performed density imbalance measurements@xcite .",
    "these measurements are performed by measuring @xmath5 as a function of interlayer bias ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "interlayer bias transfers carriers between the layers , while keeping the total density in both layers fixed .",
    "such a measurement provides a very sensitive probe as to the presence of phonon mediated@xcite ( or direct@xcite ) @xmath17 scattering .",
    "a series expansion of the power law @xmath24 dependence deduced from our density ratio measurements implies that @xmath5 will exhibit a quadratic increase with interlayer bias .",
    "if @xmath5 contains any significant contribution from @xmath17 phonon exchange , this will clearly lead to the drag decreasing as a function of @xmath23 . in inset",
    "( b ) of fig 2 , we plot @xmath5 vs @xmath23 at @xmath20 230 mk . here",
    "the layer densities are matched at @xmath25 @xmath10 at zero bias .",
    "it is clear from the figure that @xmath5 exhibits a quadratic increase with @xmath23 , consistent with our density ratio results . here",
    "@xmath26 , so thermal broadening of the fermi surface is negligible .",
    "this data conclusively shows that @xmath17 phonon exchange@xcite ( or direct @xmath17 scattering processes@xcite ) do not yield any significant contribution to the drag at @xmath16 300  .    in the main plot of fig 2 , we investigate the matched density dependence of @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath5 vs @xmath15 is plotted on log - log scale for densities ranging from @xmath27 1.0 to @xmath9 @xmath10 , taken from sample a ( @xmath16 300  ) , and at @xmath28 , taken from sample d ( @xmath16 275  ) .",
    "we find that this data is very well described by a linear fit with slope of -5 , implying that for this density range , corresponding to @xmath29 5.1 to 13.5 ( using m@xmath30 0.17m@xmath31 ) , @xmath5 follows a @xmath32 dependence at low temperature , consistent with our density ratio results . in the coulomb drag theory for weakly interacting systems@xcite , which is successful in explaining the results of drag experiments performed on high density electron systems@xcite with @xmath33 , @xmath5",
    "is expected to scale as @xmath34 .",
    "the stronger density dependence we have observed here is consistent with earlier reports@xcite that the drag between low density holes exhibits a significant enhancement over this simple theory , with the discrepancy increasing as the density is reduced . in this context",
    ", what is of particular interest is a recent experiment , on low density electron double layer systems with @xmath16 280  , which studied the drag in a regime of intermediate interaction strength , with @xmath8 ranging from about 2 to 4.3@xcite .",
    "this study also found that the drag exhibited a power law dependence on the matched electron density ( @xmath35 ) , and observed that @xmath36 .",
    "this result suggests that there is a crossover in the behavior of the drag from a @xmath34 to a @xmath32 dependence as the @xmath8 value of the system is increased .",
    "this provides yet further evidence that the large enhancement of the drag and the deviations from the @xmath0 dependence found in the dilute regime arise from correlation effects .",
    "it is important to note that the deviations we have observed could arise from two different types of correlation effects : either interlayer or intralayer correlations .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence data for different @xmath7 shown in fig 1 provides very useful information regarding differentiating between these two effects .",
    "if the deviations from the @xmath0 dependence arise from an interlayer correlation effect , we should expect them to exhibit a significant change as the layer spacing is varied .",
    "however , this is not what is observed .",
    "both the fractional deviation from @xmath0 and the peak position are found to be independent of @xmath7 , implying that interlayer correlation effects are not playing a role here , and that the deviations arise from something intrinsic within each of the single layers themselves .    at this point , it is appropriate to compare the deviations from the @xmath0 dependence of the drag to the metalliclike behavior observed in the individual layers of the samples used in this study .",
    "many believe that this strong metalliclike temperature dependence arises from correlation effects , which exist in such a large @xmath8 regime . by independently contacting one of the layers in our double layer system , we can measure the temperature dependence of the single layer resistivity .",
    "however , it is important to realize that the resistivity obtained from such a measurement is significantly enhanced due to the drag effect . due to its large magnitude",
    ", the drag effect will make a significant contribution to the single layer resistivity .",
    "since the drag has a relatively strong temperature dependence , this will significantly affect the strength of the metallic behavior obtained in a single layer resistivity measurement .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig .",
    "3 , where we have plotted the normalized @xmath1 dependence of the single layer resistivity , at @xmath37 2.5@xmath38 @xmath10 , for different @xmath7 . for reference , the single layer resitivities at @xmath20 400 mk are 1.48 , 1.83 , and 1.85 @xmath39 for the @xmath16 225 , 300 , and 450   samples , respectively .",
    "while all three of the samples here have intrinsically similar properties ( resistivity and mobility ) , it is clear that the metallic behavior becomes much stronger as @xmath7 is reduced , as should be expected from the increasing drag contribution .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to subtract the drag resistivity from the measured single layer resistivity to obtain the intrinsic single layer resistivity- that is the resistivity which would be measured if the layers could be separated infinitely far apart .",
    "this is shown in the inset , where we subtract @xmath5 from @xmath40 and plot the normalized @xmath1 dependence of @xmath40 - @xmath5 .",
    "note here that the metallic behavior in all three curves shows roughly the same strength , confirming that the change in the metallic behavior of the single layer resistivity , shown in the main plot , arises from the drag contribution to the resistivity .",
    "the most striking feature here is that the temperature at which the metallic behavior is suppressed in @xmath40 - @xmath5 is at roughly the same temperature at which the peak in @xmath14 vs @xmath1 is observed , as shown by the dashed line in the inset .",
    "in addition , in these three samples , the metallic temperature dependence produces a roughly 20 to 25 % change in @xmath40 - @xmath5 .",
    "this is extremely close to the 25 to 30 % deviation from @xmath0 , which @xmath5 exhibits over the same temperature range .",
    "these similarities seem to suggest that the deviations from the @xmath0 dependence of the drag are correlated with the anomalous metallic behavior found in the single layer , and implies that they most likely have the same origin .    the fact that both the single layer resistivity and the drag exhibit similar anomalies is quite striking , since these are two extremely different transport properties .",
    "although there have been numerous models attempting to explain the origin of the metallic behavior , here we choose to analyze our data in light of one of the most prominent : temperature dependent screening@xcite . in this model ,",
    "the metallic behavior arises from temperature dependent changes in the static screening of ionized impurity potentials , which become important at large @xmath8 .",
    "as the temperature is increased from low @xmath1 , the screening weakens significantly , leading to the metalliclike increase in the resistivity .",
    "it is possible to envision that such a screening change could give rise to the enhancement to the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath5 found at low @xmath1 .",
    "however , here we are concerned with the dynamic screening properties of the system as it screens the interlayer coulomb potential .    if the deviations from the @xmath0 dependence of the drag arise from a temperature dependent screening effect then this will surely manifest itself in the layer spacing dependence of the drag .",
    "the strength of the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath5 is proportional to the screening strength of the interlayer coulomb potential .",
    "if the screening is strong , the interlayer potential will drop rapidly with @xmath7 and @xmath5 will show a strong decrease as @xmath7 is increased . on the other hand , if screening is weak the interlayer potential will drop off much slower with @xmath7 , and @xmath5 will exhibit a much weaker decrease as @xmath7 is increased . by investigating the strength of the @xmath7 dependence at different temperatures , we can determine whether the dynamic screening properties of the 2d system in this regime exhibit any temperature dependent behavior . using data from samples a , b , and c , we have studied @xmath5 as a function of @xmath7 at various temperatures , for @xmath27 2.5 , 2.0 , and @xmath41 @xmath10 .",
    "a typical data set , obtained at @xmath20 1.0 k and plotted on log - log scale , is shown in fig 4 .",
    "as expected , we observe that @xmath5 shows a strong increase with decreasing layer spacing .",
    "the solid lines are linear fits of each data set , and their slopes correspond to the exponent , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 . using additional data at different temperatures , which are not shown",
    ", we can determine the strength of the @xmath7 dependence at each density , for different @xmath1 .",
    "we present this data in fig 5 , where we plot @xmath42 as a function of temperature for different @xmath15 .",
    "we mention that the @xmath42 found for @xmath44 @xmath10 is deduced only using data at @xmath16 225 and 300  . before discussing this data",
    ", we would first like to mention that due to the narrow range of data we are not making any quantitative claims on the values of these exponents . on the other hand ,",
    "a comparison of the relative change of @xmath42 with temperature and density is perfectly valid and independent of any of the systematic error in the @xmath7 values of our samples .",
    "the first point we make is that at all three densities , the exponent shows a weak increase with @xmath1 , implying that the dynamic screening properties in this regime are relatively independent of temperature .",
    "if anything , the screening strengthens slightly as @xmath1 is increased , the opposite of what should be expected from the @xmath1 dependent screening model . another point which is clear from this data is that the strength of the @xmath7 dependence weakens significantly as the carrier density is lowered",
    "this implies that the dynamic screening properties of the 2d system weaken dramatically as the carrier density is reduced towards the metal - insulator transition .",
    "finally , we would like to refer back to the single layer transport data presented in fig 3 , which clearly shows that in the dilute regime , the drag constitutes a significant fraction of the resistivity .",
    "in contrast , at small @xmath8@xcite the drag contribution to the resistivity is roughly 0.1 % at these temperatures .",
    "this demonstrates that in the dilute regime an electron - electron ( e - e ) scattering process can yield a substantial @xmath1 dependent correction to the resistivity , and suggests the possibility that the metallic behavior seen in so many dilute 2d systems might arise from an e - e scattering process .",
    "for example , a theory on the interaction corrections@xcite in this regime has been shown to qualitatively explain the metalliclike temperature dependence measured in experiments@xcite . in this theory",
    "the disorder breaks the translational invariance of the system , and allows e - e scattering to make a finite contribution to the resistivity .",
    "our data suggest that the magnitude of this interaction correction could possibly constitute a significant fraction of the resistivity .",
    "another possibility is that the electron system forms two channels , with only one carrying the current , which has been suggested by local compressibility measurements@xcite .",
    "here interchannel e - e scattering contributes to the resistance of the current carrying channel and could possibly create the metallic @xmath1 dependence .",
    "this is analogous to the double layer system , in which only one layer carries current and the other layer causes dissipation via interlayer e - e scattering .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown the deviations from the @xmath0 dependence of the drag to be independent of layer spacing and correlated with the metallic @xmath1 dependence in the single layer resistivity , suggesting that both anomalies have the same origin .",
    "our studies of the strength of the layer spacing dependence of @xmath5 imply that the dynamic screening properties in this regime are relatively temperature independent .",
    "however , they weaken significantly as the carrier density is reduced . finally , in this dilute regime",
    ", we have demonstrated that the drag effect itself can significantly enhance the metallic behavior in the single layer resistivity .",
