    "pionium is the hydrogen - like coulomb bound system of two oppositely charged pions .",
    "its lifetime is determined by strong @xmath1 annihilation , but it interacts mainly electromagnetically with the target atoms , while propagating through the target material with the relativistic velocity .",
    "the dirac experiment at cern  @xcite detects @xmath0-pairs with low relative momenta in their center of mass system . from the low - momentum part of the spectrum",
    ", the probability of pionium ionization ( break - up ) in the target , which is the probability for the pionium to be converted into an unbound @xmath0  pair on the exit of the target , is determined .",
    "if the dependence of the pionium ionization probability in the target as a function of its lifetime is established , this lifetime measurement may then be confronted with the value predicted in the framework of the chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "the measurement by dirac will test the standard picture of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd , providing the experimental evidence in favour of or against the existence of a large quark - antiquark condensate in the qcd vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the main thrust of the dirac technique is that the dependence of the pionium ionization probability in the target as a function of its lifetime can be established with sufficient precision . despite the progress in calculations of ionization and excitation cross - sections from different pionium states  @xcite",
    ", it proved to be difficult to solve the infinite system of differential ( kinetic ) equations , which describes the evolution of a pionium propagating through the target . in the original studies  @xcite probabilities for the pionium to leave the target in a bound state or annihilate were calculated by taking into account only low - lying atomic states .",
    "the contribution of highly - excited states was estimated by extrapolation and the sought - after probability of pionium ionization in the target was obtained indirectly by means of unitarity .",
    "the precision of the indirect calculation was challenged by the fact , that pionium excitation to ever higher lying bound states constitutes a major branch in the evolution of pionium .    in this work",
    "we solve the system of kinetic equations by taking into account dynamics of highly excited pionium bound states . within our approach the pionium ionization probability in the target",
    "is calculated directly , based on ionization cross - sections .",
    "the formalism of pionium dynamics , described by a set of the probabilistic kinetic equations , is reminded in section  [ sect : max ] .",
    "section  [ sect : min ] is devoted to the direct calculation of the ionization probability .",
    "the pionic atoms can be created in inelastic proton - nuclei collisions with the probability given by  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the double inclusive cross section for production of @xmath0  pairs without interaction in the final state with both pions produced either directly in hadronic processes or through short - lived resonances .",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the pionium momentum , energy and mass in the laboratory frame , respectively , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the momenta of the charged pions .",
    "production of the pionium atoms with the angular momentum is suppressed .",
    "the strong interaction between the two pions , which forms the atom , significantly modifies @xmath11 in comparison to the pure coulomb wave functions  @xcite .",
    "however , only ratios between the squares of the wave functions modulus at the origin enter to the following calculations .",
    "for these ratios the modification due to the strong interaction is almost cancelled .",
    "the probability of pionium production depends on the principal quantum number @xmath12 as  @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the pure coulomb wave function of the @xmath0 atom at zero distance and the correction factor @xmath15 takes into account the effect of finite - size of the pion production region and the two - pion strong interaction in the final state .",
    "it was found that this correction shifts the probability of ionization on per mille level , therefore we will use pure coulomb wave functions hereafter . for them",
    "only @xmath16 states are non - zero at the origin .",
    "if we normalize probability of atom production to unity then the probability of atom production in the @xmath17 state reads @xmath18    after production atom can either annihilate ( mainly through @xmath1 process amounts only about @xmath19%  @xcite .",
    "] ) or electromagnetically interact with target atoms .",
    "the partial decay width of the pionium in @xmath20 state into @xmath21 is @xcite : @xmath22 the @xmath23 difference of the pion - pion s - wave scattering lengths with isospin @xmath24 and @xmath25 has been calculated  @xcite within the framework of the standard chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite @xmath26 this difference leads to the predicted value of the pionium lifetime in the ground state @xmath27 lifetime of the atom is inversely proportional to the square of its wave function modulus at the origin  @xcite , so in @xmath16 states it reads @xmath28 .",
    "therefore the probability for a pionium with the laboratory momentum  @xmath29 to annihilate per unit length is @xmath30    while crossing the target a pionium electromagnetically interacts with target atoms . as a result , @xmath0  atom can be either ionized or transit from the initial bound state @xmath31 to another bound state @xmath32 ( excitation / de - excitation ) .",
    "hereafter we will denote initial and final bound states as @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "the probability of ionization per unit length from the state @xmath33 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the target density , @xmath37 is its atomic weight , @xmath38 is the avogadro constant and @xmath39 is the ionization cross section .",
    "the probability of a pionium excitation per unit length from the state @xmath33 to the final state @xmath34 is given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the discrete ( bound - bound ) transition cross section .",
    "the total inelastic cross section gives the probability of an atom to undergo an inelastic electromagnetic interaction @xmath42 total cross sections can be calculated owing to the completeness of the eigenstates of the coulomb hamiltonian .",
    "total and transition cross sections for any bound states were initially calculated in the born approximation with the static potential of target atoms  @xcite .",
    "later a more accurate set of cross sections was derived which takes into account relativistic effects , multiple photon exchange and target excitations  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in the latter work authors calculated ionization cross sections for any initial bound state with @xmath43 which provides the possibility to perform direct calculation of the pionium ionization probability in the target , which is the subject of the present work . from general formulas for transition cross sections in both sets",
    "@xcite one can derive that for any states @xmath33 and @xmath34 @xmath44 .",
    "comparison between different sets of cross sections was performed  @xcite , where authors found that uncertainties in most precise sets of cross - sections for ni target will cause only 1% uncertainty in the pionium lifetime .",
    "uncertainty due to the accuracy of cross sections is expected to dominate precision of the ionization probability dependence on the pionium lifetime .",
    "the dynamics of the pionium interaction with target atoms is supposed to be described by a set of kinetic equations  @xcite using the probabilities  @xmath45 to find the @xmath0 atom in the definite quantum state  @xmath33 at a distance  @xmath46 from the production point .",
    "this approach ignores any interference between different pionium bound states . for low @xmath12 most of interference effects",
    "are suppressed at typical pionium momenta in dirac ( @xmath47 ) as the mean free path between pionium inelastic interactions is usually longer than the formation time of atomic system multiplied by its velocity .",
    "nevertheless even for low @xmath12 some interference effects can take place due to the accidental degeneracy of energy levels of hydrogen - like atoms .",
    "this problem was considered in the framework of the density matrix formalism  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the interference between quantum states with small @xmath12 does not change the result based on a set of probabilistic kinetic equations ( their difference is less than per mille ) .",
    "eigenstates of the coulomb hamiltonian form a countable set of discrete levels . for numerical calculations",
    "we will take into account only levels with a principal quantum number @xmath48 . for a given principal quantum number @xmath12",
    "there are @xmath49 states @xmath17 with different orbital and magnetic quantum numbers .",
    "we will denote the total number of discrete bound states taken for the calculations as @xmath50 . to make the system complete",
    "we introduce a cross section @xmath51 which stands for the sum of transitions from state @xmath33 to any discrete state with a principal quantum number @xmath52 : @xmath53 it is straightforward to write the probability of pionium production in all bound states above @xmath54 : @xmath55    finally we will write the system of kinetic equations in the matrix form @xmath56 \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ w^n_1   & w^n_2   & \\ldots & w^n_n   & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ w^u_1   & w^u_2   & \\ldots & w^u_n   & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ w^\\text{ion}_1 & w^\\text{ion}_2 & \\ldots & w^\\text{ion}_n & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ w^\\text{anh}_1 & w^\\text{anh}_2 & \\ldots & w^\\text{anh}_n & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix } \\begin{pmatrix } p_1\\\\ p_2\\\\ \\ldots\\\\ p_n\\\\ p_u\\\\ p_\\text{ion}\\\\ p_\\text{anh } \\end{pmatrix}. \\label{eq : system0}\\ ] ] diagonal terms describe the total decrease of the level population @xmath57 system  ( [ eq : system0 ] ) is a system of linear homogeneous differential equations of order  1 with constant coefficients .",

    "hence the probability for a pionium to leave the target in the state @xmath33 reads @xmath65 while the probability of ionization on the exit of the target is @xmath66 expressions for the probability of annihilation @xmath67 and for the probability @xmath68 to reach any excited state with @xmath69 on the exit of the target have the same form as ( [ eq : ion_sol_av ] ) if one substitutes @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively .

    "eigenvalues were numerically found by functions from the lapack  @xcite package .",
    "system of equations  ( [ eq : system0 ] ) is constructed in a way that as soon as an atom reaches a state with @xmath69 it effectively quits from calculations and is kept intact , though in reality it is expected to undergo further electromagnetic interactions , e.g. it can be ionized or de - excited to the low - lying states .",

    "@xmath76 is the probability for atoms to reach states with @xmath82 , which amounts to about 20% .",
    "this numerical value is in agreement with the earlier calculations  @xcite ( fig.3(d ) ) .",
    "numerical precision of the above solution can be estimated from the inequality @xmath83 thus round - off errors do not affect the result .    as an atom transits to a state @xmath84 its effective radius of electromagnetic interactions grows and its characteristic ionization length is getting shorter @xmath85 the target used in dirac is @xmath86 m thick , therefore highly excited atoms have a chance to leave the target in a bound state only if they were created close to the exit of the target",
    ". otherwise these highly excited atoms will be ionized .",
    "this allows us to set the range for the ionization probability in the target : @xmath87 here the upper bound corresponds to the case when all highly excited atoms are ionized , while the lower bound @xmath75 is at least probability of ionization from states with @xmath48 .    from table  [ tab : noevol ]",
