    "an advantage of solving the moment equations is that they can be differenced to automatically conserve energy .",
    "however , enforcing energy conservation by construction does not guarantee that the solution obtained is the correct one .",
    "in fact , it is standard with many `` non - conservative '' hydrodynamic codes that do not difference the equations to conserve energy by construction to employ the degree to which energy is in fact conserved with time to assess their accuracy .",
    "we have chosen to retain the automatic energy - conserving feature , but in dynamical calculations we use electron lepton number conservation the global code check . by not differencing the equations to automatically conserve lepton number , since the equations we difference certainly do conserve lepton number , this is a useful approach .",
    "this is akin to employing entropy conservation in adiabatic flow as a check of a hydro code that is forced to conserve energy automatically by the particular differencing scheme employed .",
    "however , for the stationary atmospheres calculations we present here , for which the time derviative is zero , this is a moot point .",
    "the advantage of calculating @xmath80 and @xmath81 instead of @xmath82 is that equations  ( [ unu ] ) and ( [ vnu ] ) can be differenced in such a way that @xmath81 will go accurately to @xmath83 in the large  optical  depth , diffusion limit , and still remain accurate in the optically ",
    "thin , free  streaming limit .",
    "schemes based directly on eq .

    "the diffusion limit is assumed and @xmath81 is set equal to @xmath86 .",
    "numerical methods which solve for the spatial variation of a specific - intensity - like - variable ( _ e.g. _ , i@xmath87 $ ] ) , such as all discrete ordinate transport methods , suffer from the problem that at large optical depth , the flux is not well determined ( morel , wareing , and smith 1996 ) .",
    "this is a well - known problem , and the principle motivation for switching to feautrier variables and to full range moment methods , in which @xmath88 and @xmath89 are solved for directly .",
    "any s@xmath90 method has a spatial truncation error which is proportional to @xmath91 , where @xmath92 depends on the spatial discretization scheme .",
    "as @xmath93 grows , the error in the flux , which is proportional to @xmath91 , also grows . for feautrier variables , on the other hand , finite difference systems of equations",
    "can be derived which are at least 2nd - order accurate in @xmath94 .",
    "these give an accurate representation of the radiation field in the free streaming limit and go naturally over to the diffusion limit when @xmath93 is large .",
    "to solve eqs .",
    "( [ unu ] ) and ( [ vnu ] ) , we employ the tangent  ray method ( schinder and bludman 1989 ; mihalas and mihalas 1984 ) . at a reference radial zone",
    ", tangents are constructed to each of the interior zones .",
    "the angles of the tangent rays to the normal at the reference zone define the angular grid at that zone on which the angular integrations are performed .",
    "( [ unu ] ) and ( [ vnu ] ) are integrated along each tangent ray .",
    "if there are @xmath95 radial zones , the radiation field at the outer zone is resolved with @xmath96 angles ; as you move inward the number of angles employed decreases linearly .",
    "hence , if there are 100 radial zones , there are as many as 99 angular bins . with reasonable radial gridding",
    ", this approach can provide exquisite angular resolution , particularly for forward  peaked radiation fields , but at the cost of increased computational overhead .",
    "for instance , we have tested our implementation of the tangent  ray method with the kosirev ( 1934 ) ( spherical milne ) problem for which the absorptive opacity is assumed to be a power law in radius ( @xmath97 ) . for a variety of integer power laws ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath98 ) , with from 100 to 500 radial zones , the tangent - ray method is superior to many implementations of the discrete ordinate method ( schinder and bludman 1989 ) .",
    "however , care must be taken to avoid purely geometrical zoning , for which @xmath99 , since such zoning biases the angular binning in a systematic way .",
    "the result can be that the eddington and flux factors asymptote at infinity to between 0.96 and 0.98 , and not to 1.0 .",
    "however , purely geometrical zoning is easily avoided in real calculations .",
    "note that the increase in angular resolution with radius which comes naturally from this procedure is quite appropriate to spherical symmetry .",
    "note also that the tangent - ray method is in some sense automatically adaptive for moving grids . at @xmath100 ,",
    "the radiation field is by definition symmetric and needs no angular resolution .",
    "as @xmath72 becomes large , a small bright central source is increasingly finely resolved .    for dynamical , time ",
    "dependent calculations , solving eqs .",
    "( [ unu ] ) and ( [ vnu ] ) by the tangent - ray method at each timestep can be time - consuming , but manageable .",
    "fortunately , as long as the 2nd and 3rd angular moments do not change quickly , one need not solve eqs .",
    "( [ unu ] ) and ( [ vnu ] ) at every timestep .",
    "frequently , the solution to the moment equations ( [ east02 ] ) and ( [ east03 ] ) with previous values of @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( @xmath103 ) can be quite accurate .",
    "in fact , this is most often the case , since the neutrino radiation fields rarely change on timescales shorter than @xmath1040.1 milliseconds , whereas , due to the explicit nature of the hydro portion of the code , the courant timesteps are often near one microsecond .",
    "hence , during much of the pre  explosion delay and protoneutron star phases , as well as during much of the core collapse phase , it is quite legitimate to solve for the eddington factors only every few steps .",
    "an exception is during very dynamical phases such as shock breakout through the neutrinospheres .",
    "currently , there are two approximations in our algorithm for solving the transport equations ( [ unu ] ) and ( [ vnu ] ) .",
    "the first is that in calculating the radiation angular moments we assume that scattering into the beam is isotropic , while maintaining the correct transport cross section in the @xmath41 moment eq .",
    "( [ east03 ] ) . to approximately incorporate the effects of anisotropic scattering , we employ the transport cross sections , as described and discussed above .",
    "straightforward methods for solving the fully anisotropic problem using the feautrier variables and the approaches outlined in this paper will be described elsewhere .",
    "the second approximation involves the assumption of linearity of the characteristics . the 2nd term in both eqs .",
    "( [ unu ] ) and ( [ vnu ] ) which is proportional to @xmath105 comes from the aberration experienced in going from the local to a nearby rest frame .",
    "the characteristics are not perfectly straight , which can make the calculation more difficult .",
    "one can not simply integrate along a straight  line impact ray .",
    "however , these terms are often insignificant because we require only an estimate of @xmath80 and @xmath81 and are using them to compute only the closure coefficients , @xmath101 and @xmath102 . rather than just ignore these two terms , we have substituted @xmath106 in equation ( [ unu ] ) and @xmath107 in equation ( [ vnu ] ) .",
    "the substitution in eq .",
    "( [ usubs ] ) is derived by integrating the left  hand ",
    "side by parts and the substitution in eq .",
    "( [ vsubs ] ) is derived by integrating @xmath33 times the left  hand ",

    "importantly , the two terms in ( [ usubs ] ) integrate to the same thing and @xmath33 times the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ vsubs ] ) integrate to the same thing .",

    "examples of effects that may or may not be included in simpler schemes are the final  state electron blocking term for the charged  current absorption process (  [ ccabs ] ) , stimulated absorption corrections (  [ stimabs ] ) , weak magnetism and recoil (  [ ccabs ] ) , and the velocity advection , aberration , and doppler shift terms in the transport equation ( eqs .",

    "the blocking correction to the emergent @xmath63 luminosity is @xmath264% and that due to stimulated absorption is @xmath265% .",

    "blocking increases the net gain by 1020% , while stimulated absorption decreases it by less than 5% . without electron",
    "blocking , the absorption cross sections are artifically enhanced . since the degree of degeneracy is different in the envelope and around the neutrinospheres , the magnitude of this effect in the two regions is different , enhancing the emergent luminosity more than it decreases the coupling in the periphery .",
    "stimulated absorption has the opposite effect (  [ stimabs ] ) , but its effect in the core and in the envelope is similarly differential .    in these model",
    "bm calculations , the effects of weak magnetism and recoil on the emergent @xmath63 and @xmath64 neutrino spectra and luminosities are small ( @xmath270% ) .",
    "this is due in part to the fact that the presence of scattering mutes the effect of changes in the absorption cross section through the thermalization depth effect . due to the modest scattering albedo ( figure 4 ) , the response of the radial dependence of the radiation field to changes in the absorption cross section is not linear with the change in the absorption cross section itself .",
    "the increase in the net gain that one would anticipate due to any increase in the @xmath64 luminosity is countered by the concommitant decrease in the absorption cross section in the gain region .",
    "the winds that emerge from protoneutron stars after their envelopes supernova are powered by neutrino energy deposition in the expanding gas . just as with the supernova itself ,",
    "the wind mass and enthalpy fluxes , velocities , entropies , and compositions are influenced by details of neutrino ",
    "matter coupling and neutrino transport .",
    "the distribution of the heating determines the magnitude , spatial extent , and timescale of acceleration . in turn , the degree of r  processing in the ejecta is a function of the expansion timescale , the asymptotic @xmath61 , and entropy ( woosley and hoffman 1992 ; qian and woosley 1996 ) .",
    "hence , it is important to gauge the relative strengths of the various terms that determine the degree and distribution of neutrino ",
    "matter heating .",
    "the effect of the velocity terms on the emergent @xmath63 and @xmath64 spectra for model w is depicted in figure 13 .",
    "model w is the post ",
    "explosion wind model from burrows , hayes , and fryxell ( 1995 ) , in which the velocities at large radii are @xmath10430,000@xmath271 .",
    "of course , at small radii they are zero . as figure 13 shows",
    ", the velocity effects collectively boost the emergent spectra of model w in a given energy group by @xmath10415% , with a corresponding boost in the @xmath63 and @xmath64 luminosities by 15% and 13% , respectively .",
    "this is mostly a consequence of the doppler shift of the radiation field . due to the smaller velocities in the important accretion regions in model bm , the velocity corrections for that model are much smaller ( @xmath272% ) .",
    "figure 14 shows the net gain in model w for our fiducial model , as well as without blocking , velocity corrections , or weak magnetism / recoil corrections and implies that various terms not easily or often included in flux  limited or energy ",
    "integrated transport can each make a @xmath273% difference in the parameters of the wind .",
    "note that though the weak magnetism / recoil corrections for model bm are small , those for model w are modest .",
    "this result implies that the importance of absorption cross section changes is a function of the specific thermal and composition profiles .",
    "what distinguishes the wind is the more abrupt transition from the diffusive to the streaming regime and the lower @xmath61 value in its decoupling region ( figure 1 ) .",
    "whereas , in model bm the slight increase in the core luminosity due to the inclusion of the weak magnetism / recoil term is nullified by the decrease in the absorption opacity in the envelope when determining the net gain , in model w the slight increase in the luminosity due to the lower absorption cross section that is a consequence of weak magnetism ( particularly for the @xmath64 neutrinos ) is not adequate to counter the resulting greater transparency of the envelope .",
    "the @xmath61 at the base of the wind s atmosphere is smaller than that near the neutrinospheres in model bm , with the result that the scattering albedo for the @xmath64 neutrinos is larger there .",
    "this results in a smaller increase in the emergent luminosity that ca nt compensate for the increase in the transparency of the wind s mantle .",
    "the anisotropy of neutrino  nucleon scattering and the difference between the transport and the total cross sections ( eq . [ transcs ] ) can in principle translate into larger inverse flux factors and , hence , greater net gain .",
    "backscattering increases @xmath257 for a given @xmath258 and delays the transition from isotropic to forward  peaked radiation fields .",
    "however , since absorption plays an important role for the @xmath63 and @xmath64 neutrinos and their scattering albedos are not very close to one , the backscatter effect is muted .",
    "the upshot is that anisotropy accounts for only @xmath274% of the net gain and results in shifts of less than 1% in the @xmath63 or @xmath64 spectra .",
    "it is common to seek methods for solving eqs .",
    "( [ east02 ] ) and ( [ east03 ] ) without employing the full machinery of transport . in principle , such methods simplify the mathematics and speed solution , but they compromise accuracy .",
    "( [ east02 ] ) and ( [ east03 ] ) are the first two equations in a moment hierarchy in which each moment equation involves still higher - order moments ; to solve such a hierarchy precisely requires the solution of an infinite number of moment equations .",
    "the simplifying ansatz often introduced is that higher - order moments can be written in terms of lower - order moments , thereby closing the system of equations .",
    "however , these so - called closure relations can vary a great deal .",
    "the most common closure is the flux - limiter .    in flux - limited schemes ,",
    "( [ east03 ] ) is reduced to its diffusion form in which @xmath258 is set equal to the product of the gradient of @xmath275 and a coefficient ( the flux limiter ) , @xmath275 is set equal to @xmath276 ( the eddington closure ) , and this expression for @xmath258 is inserted into the divergence term in eq .",
    "( [ east02 ] ) . only this zeroth - moment",
    "( energy ) equation is solved .",
    "the third - order moment , @xmath277 , important for multi - energy group calculations in moving media , is generally ignored .",
    "the art of this approach is in the choice of the flux limiter , so - called because the coefficient is constructed in such a way that the flux , otherwise mathematically diffusive in this scheme , does not exceed the streaming limit , @xmath257 .",
    "this is necessitated by the dropping of eq .",
    "( [ east03 ] ) , with its causality - enforcing time derivative .",
    "all angular information is lost , though some flux limiters are derived under certain assumptions about the angular distribution ( _ cf .",
    "_ levermore and pomraning 1981 ) .",
    "examples of flux - limiters that have been employed in supernova calculations are wilson s ( bowers and wilson 1982 ) and bruenn s ( 1985 ; messer 1998 ) .",
    "their prescription for the flux is : h_= - ( 1 + _ f)^-1 , [ wlimit ] where @xmath278 for wilson and @xmath279 for bruenn , @xmath280 , and @xmath281 is the transport mean - free - path .",
    "the expression in parentheses is the limiter .",
    "hence , in flux - limiter closures , @xmath258 is a function of only @xmath257 and its derivative ( or @xmath257 and @xmath282 ) and @xmath283 ( @xmath284 ) is set equal to @xmath285 .",
    "note that the knudsen parameter ( @xmath282 ) is small in the diffusion limit .",
    "the subscript @xmath18 is a reminder that these equations apply for each energy group .",
    "it is important to note what should be obvious : not all flux limiters are the same , nor are their quantitative consequences .",
    "hence , there is not a uniform  flux limiter \" result .",
    "for instance , the mgfld scheme of messer ( 1998 ) is merely one such approach .",
    "the results of employing a given flux limiter can deviate from the correct result as much as can the results derived using various flux limiters deviate from one another .      to gauge the character of the proper angular dependence of the neutrino distribution functions in the supernova context , we provide in figure 15 the model bm eddington factor ( @xmath283 ) versus radius for @xmath63 neutrinos , at particle energies from 5 to 30 mev .",
    "as we would expect from the decoupling hierarchy , the @xmath2 eddington factors start their rise from the isotropic value of @xmath285 from the deepest layers .",
    "however , for all neutrino species , particularly for the @xmath64 and @xmath2 neutrinos , the eddington factor is a stiff function of energy and only gradually makes the transition from @xmath285 to @xmath286 over a region that can be 50 to 150 kilometers wide .",
    "many flux limiters effect the related transition from diffusion to free streaming early ( at higher @xmath287s ) and within an unphysically narrow range in radius and @xmath287 .",
    "this can be seen in figure 16 where the bruenn and wilson flux limiters for @xmath63 neutrinos at 20 mev in model bm are compared with the  effective \" flux limiter derived using full transport .",
    "approximately 20 kilometers interior to the appropriate point , the bruenn and wilson limiters begin to deviate from the diffusion value of 1.0 .",
    "polar plots depicting representative angular distributions of the model bm @xmath64 specific intensity ( @xmath288 ) field for an energy of 15 mev are presented as solid lines in figure 17 . the transition from isotropy to forward  peaked is clear , as is the gradual nature of that transition . there is no corresponding angular function for either the bruenn or wilson limiter .",
    "complementary to this polar plot are figures 18 through 20 of the full transport phase  space densities ( @xmath139 ) versus energy at various radii and for all the neutrino species .",
    "depicted are the phase  space densities along the 0@xmath289 and 90@xmath289 directions . for the @xmath63 neutrinos ,",
    "the degree of degeneracy at depth is clear ; one can almost read the @xmath63 chemical potentials off the graph . from figure 19",
    ", we see that the occupancy of the @xmath64 neutrino states is generically low , but from figure 20 we see that at depth and for low energies the occupancy of the @xmath2 neutrino states can approach 0.5 . blocking due to final ",
    "state @xmath2 occupancy is generally unimportant in the pair source terms , since the peak energies of the pair source functions are always significantly above the energies at which @xmath139 is high .    among other things , figures 18 through 20 convey a sense of the angular dependence of @xmath139 , ignored in the standard flux - limiter schemes . at depth , since the radiation fields are isotropic , the 0@xmath289 and 90@xmath289 curves are the same .",
    "however , with increasing radius and at lower energies , deviations from isotropy manifest themselves ; transverse beams are less occupied than forward beams .",
    "as expected , at low optical depths this differential effect is quite pronounced .",
    "flux - limited transport schemes are not capable of addressing or illuminating this phenomenology .      given the nuances in the angular distributions of the neutrino radiation fields portrayed in figures 15 - 20 , it is no wonder that flux limiters only inadequately represent the radiation energy density profiles , emergent spectra , and net gain in the semi - transparent decoupling region .",
    "this is made manifest by comparing the emergent spectra and net gain derived using such flux limiters with those same quantities obtained using full transport .",
    "figure 21 compares the emergent @xmath63 spectrum for the bm model using the full feautrier / tangent - ray formalism , bruenn s limiter , and wilson s limiter .",
    "though comparisons for many snapshot profiles would be useful , we can still conclude for such an early protoneutron star epoch that bruenn s limiter , as simple as it is , results in a spectrum that deviates from the more precise spectrum by @xmath1045 - 10% , while wilson s limiter , despite its modestly greater complexity , can be off by as much as @xmath10420 - 30% .",
    "figure 22 , in which curves of the net gain ( heating ) versus radius are compared , tells a similar story : bruenn s limiter yields net gains that are generally off , but by no more than @xmath10420% , while wilson s can be off by as much as @xmath10450% .",
    "figures 21 and 22 serve to illustrate both that all flux limiters are not the same and , in particular , that they can underestimate the net gain in the outer gain region by many tens of percent .    in sum",
    ", flux - limiter schemes can miscalculate net heating rates , radiation energy densities ( quantities that factor into the net gain ) , emergent spectra , and the inverse flux factors by from 5% to 50% and can artificially accelerate the transition from isotropy to free  streaming in the @xmath290 region .",
    "this is particularly true for neutrinos , with their extended neutrinospheres .",
    "furthermore , the thermalization depth effect is difficult to handle with flux limiters when the scattering albedo is large .",
    "the albedo for @xmath2 neutrinos is above 0.90 throughout most of the object . as a result",
    ", only full transport can properly handle the enhancement in the effective absorption path due to the frustrated escape caused by scattering .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath3 neutrinos and their antiparticles carry away from the protoneutron star more than 50% of its total binding energy .",
    "since they do not participate in charged  current interactions , they energetically decouple at smaller radii and , hence , at larger temperatures , than the other neutrino species .",
    "this results in a harder spectrum ( figure 6 ) and the hardness hierarchy alluded to in  [ heat ] .",
    "the fact that there are four species is primarily responsible for their major cooling role .",
    "matter energy coupling is affected by the inverse production processes of pair annihilation and nucleon  nucleon bremsstrahlung (  [ bremsst ] ) , as well as by neutrino ",
    "nucleon and neutrino  electron scattering .",
    "the proper treatment of energy redistribution by scattering is deferred to a later publication .",
    "however , it is clear that scattering generically softens the @xmath2 spectra .",
    "ignoring the potential effects of neutrino oscillations , the emergent @xmath2 spectra have a direct bearing on the process of neutrino nucleosynthesis ( woosley _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 ) and on the suitability of various underground detectors that rely on neutral  current spallation processes with high energy thresholds . in both cases ,",
    "the relevant neutral ",

    "bremsstrahlung has a major effect on the @xmath2 radiation field .",
    "the factor @xmath185 in  [ bremsst ] incorporates a correction for our approximations to the propagator terms and to the nuclear matrix element . in figure 6 , @xmath185 was set equal to @xmath254 .",
    "using hannestadt and raffelt ( 1998 ) and our own estimates of the correct propagator terms , we derive that above @xmath293 g @xmath221 @xmath185 is above 0.7 and that at and around @xmath294 g @xmath221 @xmath185 is near 0.2 .",
    "this translates into an",
    " average \" @xmath185 of @xmath295 for protoneutron stars .",
    "figure 23 depicts the consequences of varying @xmath185 from 0.0 to 1.0 in steps of 0.2 for the emergent @xmath2 energy spectrum . due to the presence of an absorption term for every emission term ( kirchhoff s law ; eq . [ kirchh ] ) , the strength of the spectrum is not strictly linear in @xmath185 .",
    "as figure 23 demonstrates , nucleon  nucleon bremsstrahlung is softer than @xmath170 annihilation ( the other major @xmath230 source ) and can dominate at low energies . though the emergent spectra are softer , due to the extra source the spectra are also brighter at every energy .",
    "hence , the inclusion of nucleon  nucleon bremsstrahlung increases the flux , while decreasing the average and peak neutrino energies .",
    "this is important . at 10 mev , the @xmath2 spectrum can be more than a factor of _ two _ stronger with bremsstrahlung than without . for energies above @xmath296 mev ,",
    "@xmath170 annihilation still dominates the emergent spectrum . in figure 23",
    ", the lowest curve corresponds to a pure @xmath170 annihilation source .",

    "the influence on these quantities , in particular on the net gain , of various corrections to the charged - current cross section and terms in the transport equation were examined and the character of the neutrino radiation fields and spectra was scrutinized .",
    "one goal has been to provide a detailed snapshot of the neutrino radial , angular , energy , and species distributions in a typical post  bounce environment , including in the protoneutron star context , and to explore the factors that determine the heating rates in the semi  transparent gain region , so central to the viability of the neutrino  driven mechanism of supernova explosions . to this end , we focused on the decoupling transition of the emergent neutrinos .",
    "moreover , we compared the emergent spectra and neutrino heating rates obtained using representative flux limiters with those obtained using our feautrier transport algorithm to gauge the accuracy of those oft - used approximate schemes . finally , we derived the rate of nucleon  nucleon bremsstrahlung and its neutrino source spectrum and showed for the first time that it probably dominates @xmath2 neutrino production and spectrum formation .",

    "however , we have yet to generalize the scheme for use in multi  dimensional supernova simulations or in the general relativisitic context , nor have we parallelized it for use on shared  memory machines . hence , much technical work remains .",
    "supernova theory has been evolving for thirty years and in that time our understanding of the neutrino and its interactions has changed substantially .",
    "there are now indications from atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments that lepton number is not strictly conserved and that neutrinos may mix .",
    "heating in the protoneutron star mantle is a subtle sum of competing effects .",
    "we have investigated in this paper but a few of these .",
    "this effort to fully characterize the neutrino radiation fields is part of a larger effort , as yet unfinished , to understand the mechanism of supernova explosions and their systematics .",
    "however , when this puzzle box is eventually opened , precise neutrino transport will certainly be one of the keys .    we are pleased to acknowledge ray sawyer , georg raffelt , dimitri mihalas , tony mezzacappa , chuck horowitz , john hayes , and steve bruenn for useful contributions and guidance .",
    "in addition , we extend special thanks to jorge horvath for his help with the bremsstrahlung calculations and to steve bruenn and tony mezzacappa for providing some of their output in electronic form .",
