    "observations of the host galaxies of long - duration @xmath17-ray bursts ( grbs ) have led to the general consensus that they are faint and blue .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence for intense star formation activity , as well as low metallicity and stellar mass @xcite . in particular , a comparison of @xmath11 grb hosts to sloan digital sky survey galaxies suggests that grbs occur preferentially in low metallicity galaxies with @xmath18 z@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "these authors also propose an upper metallicity cutoff of about 0.15 z@xmath5 for typical grbs ( i.e. , with @xmath19 erg ) . at higher redshifts , @xmath20 ,",
    "a comparison to the host galaxies of goods supernovae indicates that grbs tend to occur in lower luminosity galaxies ( by about 1 mag ) and therefore presumably at lower metallicity @xcite .",
    "metallicities measured from afterglow absorption spectra ( at @xmath21 ) span a wider range , @xmath22 z@xmath5 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "theoretical studies have also argued for `` low '' metallicity of grb progenitors @xcite , although we stress that the definition is not well - quantified , and black hole remnants can apparently be formed even above solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "these observations raise two crucial and related questions : ( i ) _ is there in fact a low metallicity bias for grb progenitors , in both an absolute sense and relative to the average metallicity at any redshift ? _ ( ii ) _ can grbs and their host galaxies be used as a representative tracer of star formation at high redshift ( @xmath12 ) ? _",
    "the answer to these questions is of great importance given the unique ability of grbs to probe the interstellar medium and star forming environments of galaxies over a wide redshift range , extending to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it is also crucial to understand the effect of metallicity in light of the redshift evolution of the average metallicity and mass function of galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . equally important",
    ", the metallicity range for grb progenitors impacts our understanding of the progenitor population and grb formation scenarios @xcite .",
    "the prevalence of grbs in blue galaxies may also reflect an observational bias against dusty galaxies due to obscuration of the optical afterglow .",
    "two lines of evidence suggest that this may not be a significant problem .",
    "first , the host galaxies of the `` optically dark '' grbs ( those with clear evidence for dust obscuration in the optical band ) are typically not redder than the hosts of optically - bright grbs @xcite .",
    "a notable exception is grb030115 , with a dust - reddened afterglow and a host galaxy with @xmath24 mag @xcite .",
    "second , radio , submillimeter , and ir observations have not led to a preferential detection of the dark grb hosts @xcite , despite an expectation that these galaxies should have obscured star formation .",
    "conversely , the host galaxies with long - wavelength detections ( and hence obscured star formation ) , have blue colors typical of the grb host population as a whole @xcite .",
    "here we present optical and nir observations of grb020127 , which reveal that the host galaxy is an extremely red object ( ero ) with @xmath0 mag .",
    "the grb position is obtained from x - ray and radio observations of the afterglow .",
    "the host sed is best fit by an obscured starburst galaxy template at @xmath1 , with a stellar mass of @xmath25 m@xmath5 and an inferred metallicity @xcite of about 0.5 z@xmath5 , suggesting that grb progenitors can in fact exist at near - solar metallicity , and may occur in the most massive galaxies at @xmath26 .",
    "was discovered by the  satellite on 2002 jan .  27.875 ut , with a positional accuracy of @xmath27 radius @xcite . the burst duration and fluence in the @xmath28 kev band are @xmath29 s and @xmath30 erg @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "optical observations did not uncover an afterglow candidate , with @xmath32 mag at 4.4 and 8.2 hr after the burst , respectively @xcite , and @xmath33 mag at 3.1 hr over @xmath34 of the error circle @xcite .",
    "the galactic extinction in the direction of  is low , @xmath35 mag @xcite .",
    "we initiated two 10 ks observations with the , @xmath36 and @xmath37 d after the burst , to identify the fading x - ray afterglow .",
    "the data were obtained with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) and reduced and analyzed using the ciao software package .",
    "a comparison of the two epochs reveals three fading sources not associated with bright stellar counterparts . of these , only one is detected in both epochs , and has faded with high significance , with 2.6 and 1.0 count ks@xmath38 ( @xmath39 kev ) , respectively . using a galactic column of @xmath40 @xmath31 @xcite and a photon index of @xmath41 , we find fluxes of @xmath42 and @xmath43 erg @xmath31 s@xmath38 , respectively , corresponding to a power law decay rate , @xmath44 , typical of grb afterglows .",
    "the position of the x - ray afterglow candidate is @xmath45= , @xmath46= ( j2000 ) , with an uncertainty of about @xmath47 in each coordinate .",

    "as in the esi spectra , we detect the host continuum but no emission or absorption features .",
    "the optical / nir spectral energy distribution of the host galaxy is shown in figure  [ fig : sed ] . with @xmath76 mag",
    "the host is classified as an ero , and is the reddest grb host to date .",
    "eros fall in two general categories of old , passively - evolving elliptical galaxies , and dust - obscured star forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "long grbs have never been localized to elliptical galaxies , and we further distinguish the two possibilities using the observed sed .",
    "we use the hyperz package @xcite to fit a range of model templates ( starburst , e , s0-sc , and irr ) with the redshift , stellar population age , and extinction as free parameters .",
    "we assume a @xcite extinction curve .",
    "the elliptical galaxy model provides an unsatisfactory fit with a probability of only @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ; figures  [ fig : sed ] and [ fig : chi2 ] ) , due to the expected flat slope ( in @xmath79 ) beyond 1 @xmath49 m and a brighter @xmath52-band magnitude .",
    "the starburst template , on the other hand , provides an excellent fit ( @xmath80 ; figure  [ fig : chi2 ] ) .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath81 , an age of about 0.7 gyr , a rest - frame extinction , @xmath82 mag , and an absolute rest - frame magnitude , @xmath83 mag .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath2 l@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "a comparison to uv - selected galaxies at @xmath6 @xcite indicates that the host mass is @xmath84 m@xmath5 . using the relation of @xcite and the observed @xmath59-band ( 2200   rest - frame ) flux of @xmath85 @xmath49jy",
    ", we estimate an unobscured star formation rate of @xmath86 m@xmath5 yr@xmath38 . the value corrected for extinction is about an order of magnitude larger .",
    "the host of  is distinguished from other grb host galaxies in several ways .",
    "first , it is more than 3 magnitudes redder than the average value for grb hosts , and even a magnitude redder than the host of grb030115 ( figure  [ fig : r - k ] ) .",
    "this is due to the combined effect of extinction and a more evolved stellar population compared to the typical value of about 0.1 gyr for other grb hosts @xcite .",
    "second , it is four magnitude more luminous than the median value of @xmath87 mag for grb hosts ( with a range of @xmath88 to @xmath89 mag ; figure  [ fig : mb ] ) .",
    "third , the inferred stellar mass is nearly two orders of magnitudes larger than the median value of @xmath90 m@xmath5 for grb hosts @xcite .",
    "finally , the unobscured specific star formation rate of about 1 m@xmath5 yr@xmath38 @xmath91 , is nearly an order of magnitude lower than for other grb hosts @xcite , but we note that with the extinction correction it is in fact similar .",
    "perhaps most importantly , a comparison to the mass - metallicity relation of uv - selected galaxies at @xmath6 @xcite indicates that the host of  has @xmath92 , or about @xmath9 z@xmath5 .",
    "this is also similar to the metallicities of the so - called distant red galaxies ( drgs ; @xmath93 mag ) , which have median ages and masses of @xmath94 gyr and @xmath95 m@xmath5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy of , identified through x - ray and radio afterglow observations , is the reddest , and most luminous and massive grb host discovered to date .",
    "unfortunately , the early optical limits (  [ sec : obs ] ) are too shallow to ascertain whether the afterglow was significantly extinguished by dust ; from the x - ray flux at 4.14 d we expect @xmath96 mag at the time of the early optical observations , at the level of the available limits . for grb030115 , the only other burst with an ero host galaxy , the afterglow itself was shown to be significantly dust extinguished , with @xmath97 mag @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible that dusty galaxies are under - represented in the current grb host sample , due to obscuration of the optical afterglow , but we stress that the hosts of several dark bursts are not significantly redder than the median of the sample @xcite .",
    "the discovery of a grb in a massive , and hence metal - enriched , starburst galaxy indicates that the proposed low metallicity bias of grb progenitors ( @xmath98 z@xmath5 ; @xcite ) is not likely to be as severe as previously claimed , particularly at @xmath12 .",
    "this appears to be true not only in terms of an absolute metallicity cutoff , but also relative to the mass - metallicity relation of galaxies at high redshift . in particular , while the hosts of grbs at @xmath11 appear to have metallicities at the low end of the distribution for local galaxies @xcite , at least some grbs at @xmath6 occur in the most metal - enriched galaxies _ at that redshift_. this conclusion is also supported by the metallicities derived from afterglow absorption spectra ( at @xmath21 ) , which range up to solar values @xcite , as well as by the detection of submillimeter emission from some grb hosts @xcite . since grb progenitors appear to occur at least up to @xmath99 z@xmath5 , and",
    "given that the @xmath7-@xmath8 relations at @xmath100 and @xmath94 are systematically lower by about 0.3 and 0.6 dex , respectively , compared to the local relation @xcite , we conclude that even if a slight low metallicity bias does exist , its effect will diminish beyond @xmath100 .    instead , the blue colors of grb host galaxies may reflect their young stellar populations .",
    "this is likely related to the fact that grb progenitors are massive stars , which explode within a few million years of formation , thereby leading to the selection of young starburst galaxies .",
    "in fact , for @xmath101 , the average @xmath102 color of a 0.1 gyr population is about 2.5 mag , in good agreement with the observed colors of grb hosts , while for 0.3 and 1 gyr populations it is about 1 and 2.5 magnitudes redder , respectively ( figure  [ fig : r - k ] ) .",
    "this explanation might also account for the transition at low redshift ( @xmath11 ) from a representative to a predominantly low luminosity host population , since locally young starburst activity occurs primarily in low mass galaxies .",
    "@xcite show that locally the fraction of galaxies with recent starburst activity increases strongly with decreased mass .",
    "similarly , @xcite show that while at @xmath103 nearly half of all galaxies with @xmath104 m@xmath5 undergo intense star formation activity , locally , this number is less than @xmath105 . in this scenario ,",
    "the driving parameter is stellar population age , which may be misidentified as a low metallicity bias .",
    "clearly , a study of the stellar population ages of the low redshift grb hosts is required to assess whether age , and not metallicity , in fact plays the underlying role .",
    "thus , we conclude that at least at @xmath12 , grbs and their host galaxies are likely to trace star formation in a relatively unbiased way , with possibly a preference for younger starburst populations . at @xmath106",
    "there seems to be a bias in favor of low luminosity / mass galaxies @xcite , but this may be driven by stellar population age and not metallicity .",
    "the luminosity function of grb hosts ( see also @xcite ) therefore indicates that the bulk of the star formation at @xmath12 takes place in galaxies fainter than l@xmath3 , in good agreement with the steep faint - end slope of the luminosity function of high redshift galaxies .",
