    "clusters of galaxies represent the largest virialized structures in the present universe , formed at relatively late times .",
    "the hierarchical scenario provides a picture in which the primordial density fluctuations generate proto - structures which are then subject to gravitational collapse and mass accretion , producing larger and larger systems .",
    "the cosmic baryons fall into the gravitational potential of the cluster dark matter ( dm ) halo formed in this way , while the collapse and the subsequent shocks heat the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) up to the virial temperature ( @xmath9 kev ) .    in the simplest scenario which neglects all non - radiative processes ,",
    "the gravity , which has not preferred scales , is the only responsible for the physical properties of galaxy clusters : for this reason they are expected to maintain similar properties when rescaled with respect to their mass and formation epoch .",
    "this allows to build a very simple model to relate the physical parameters of clusters : the so - called self - similar model @xcite .",
    "based on that , we can derive scaling relations ( see sect .",
    "[ scales1 ] ) between x - ray quantities ( like temperature @xmath2 , mass @xmath10 , entropy and luminosity @xmath11 ) , and between x - ray and sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) measurements ( like the compton-@xmath12 parameter ) , thanks to the assumption of spherical collapse for the dm halo and hydrostatic equilibrium of the gas within the dm gravitational potential .",
    "these relations provide a powerful test for the adiabatic scenario . in particular , in the recent years the studies about the x - ray scaling laws , together with observations of the entropy distribution in galaxy clusters ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the analysis of simulated systems including cooling and extra non - gravitational energy injection ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have suggested that the simple adiabatic scenario is not giving an appropriate description of galaxy clusters .",
    "in particular the most significant deviations with respect to the self - similar predictions are : ( i ) a lower ( by @xmath13 per cent ) normalization of the @xmath14 relation in real clusters with respect to adiabatic simulations @xcite ; ( ii ) steeper slopes for the @xmath14 and @xmath5 relations ; ( iii ) an entropy ramp in the central regions of clusters ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these deviations are likely the evidence of non - radiative processes , like non - gravitational heating due to energy injection from supernovae , agn , star formation or galactic winds ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "more recently some authors pointed out that there is a mild dependence of the x - ray scaling relations on the redshift , suggesting that there should be an evolution of these non - gravitational processes with @xmath3 .    an additional and independent method to evaluate the role of radiative processes",
    "is the study of the scaling relations based on the thermal sz effect @xcite , which offers a powerful tool for investigating the same physical properties of the icm , being the electron component of cosmic baryons responsible of both the x - ray emission and the sz effect .",
    "the advantage of the latter on the former is the possibility of exploring clusters at higher redshift , because of the absence of the cosmological dimming .",
    "moreover , since the sz intensity depends linearly on the density , unlike the x - ray flux , which depends on the squared density , with the sz effect it is possible to obtain estimates of the physical quantities of the sources reducing the systematic errors originated by the presence of sub - clumps and gas in multi - phase state and to study in a complementary way to the x - ray analysis the effects of extra - physics on the collapse of baryons in cluster dark matter halos , both via numerical simulations @xcite and observationally ( cooray 1999 ; mccarthy et al .",

    "the main purpose of this paper is to understand how these sz and x - ray scaling relations evolve with redshift .",
    "in particular we want to quantify how much they differ from the self - similar expectations in order to evaluate the amplitude of the effects of the non - gravitational processes on the physical properties of icm .",
    "another issue we want to debate is which relations can be considered a robust tool to link different cluster physical quantities : this has important consequences on the possibility of using clusters as probes for precision cosmology .",
    "to do that , we have assembled a sample of 24 galaxies clusters , for which measurements of the compton-@xmath12 parameter are present in the literature .",
    "respect the previous works we have done our own spatially resolved x - ray analysis recovering x - ray and sz quantity necessary to investigate scaling relations .",
    "we have performed a combined spatial and spectral analysis of the x - ray data , which allows us to derive the radial profile for temperature , pressure , and density in a robust way .",
    "these results , which have high spatial resolution , rely only on the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis and spherical geometry of the sources .",

    "we have considered the gain file provided within caldb ( version 3.0 ) in this tool for the data in faint and vfaint modes .",
    "then we have filtered the data to include the standard events grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 6 only , and therefore we have filtered for the good time intervals ( gtis ) supplied , which are contained in the flt1.fits file .",
    "we checked for unusual background rates through the script analyze_ltcrv , so we removed those points falling outside @xmath21 from the mean value .",

    "the images have been extracted from the events 2 files in the energy range ( 0.5 - 5.0 kev ) , corrected by using the exposure map to remove the vignetting effects , by masking out the point sources .",
    "so as to determine the centroid ( @xmath22 ) of the surface brightness we have fitted the images with a circular one - dimensional ( 1d ) isothermal @xmath23-model , by adding a constant brightness model , and leaving @xmath24 and @xmath25 free as parameters in the best fit .",
    "we constructed a set of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) circular annuli around the centroid of the surface brightness up to a maximum distance @xmath28 ( also reported in table [ tab:1 ] ) , selecting the radii according to the following criteria : the number of net counts of photons from the source in the ( 0.5 - 5.0 kev ) band is at least 200 - 1000 per annulus and the signal - to - noise ratio is always larger than 2 .",

    "conversely , for the acis  s data we have considered the acis - s3 chip only and we have equally used the local background , but we have checked for systematic errors due to possible source contamination of the background regions .",
    "this is done considering also the acis  blank - sky \" background files , which we have re - processed if their gain file does not match the one of the events 2 file ; then we have applied the aspect solution files of the observation to the background dataset by using reproject_events , so as to estimate the background for our data .",

    "thanks to the results of numerical simulations , we know , indeed , sufficiently well the dm physics which is in fact very simple , only depending on the gravity , unlike the physics of the baryons , which is also affected by further sources of non - gravitational energy .",
    "moreover we have removed the observational biases in the determination of the deprojected temperature ( and consequently of the mass ) by adopting the spectral - like temperature estimator ( see sect . [ depr ] ) . in this way",
    "we have a bias - free estimate of the deprojected temperature and , therefore , of the cluster mass .",
    "below we focus our attention on @xmath189 , because it is directly related to the total energy of the particles and so comparable to the results of hydrodynamical simulations , unlike @xmath39 , which is affected by observational biases ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "first , we notice that the two different models for the dm profile give slightly different results .",
    "nevertheless , at an overdensity of @xmath190 the masses determined by using rtm are in perfect agreement with the ones determined by using nfw ( @xmath191 and @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 ) . at @xmath195",
    "the situation becomes less clear , because for most of the clusters we needed to extrapolate from @xmath32 ( corresponding to @xmath196 ) up to @xmath195 , being @xmath32 of order of @xmath197-@xmath198 of the virial radius ( roughly corresponding to @xmath199 ) .",
    "hereafter we consider only the rtm model , even if most of the results present in the literature are usually based on the nfw one .",
    "considering the whole sample , we find a normalization ( @xmath200 ) , which is @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) per cent smaller than the value found by @xcite ( ) , who only consider relaxed clusters .",
    "our normalization ( @xmath203 ) is instead @xmath201 ( @xmath204 ) per cent larger than the value of allen et al .",
    "( arnaud et al . )",
    "if we only consider the cc - only subsample .",
    "this suggests a different behaviour depending on the presence or not of a cooling core ( see also the left panel fig .",
    "[ l - t3rela ] ) : in fact we find that at @xmath205 the normalization of the ncc subsample at @xmath206 ( corresponding to our median value for the mass ) is @xmath207 per cent smaller than for the cc - only subsample ; conversely at @xmath208 the two subsamples give consistent normalizations , but the robustness of this result is affected by the fact that in this case we have to extrapolate the mass profile out of the region covered by observational data .",
    "some other authors prefer to mask out the central region ( up to 0.1@xmath209 ) in the determination of the mass profile .",
    "we have decided to check the effects of the inclusion of the cooling region in our analysis by comparing the values of the mass obtained by excluding or not the central 100 kpc in the determination of the best fit parameters of the rtm profile : we pointed out that accounting for the cooling region does not involve any systematic error on the determination of the mass , indeed we obtain more statistically robust results .",
    "consequently the disagreement between cc and ncc clusters is probably due to a different state of relaxation , namely that the former are more regular and with more uniform physical properties than the latter @xcite ; this is true even if we have masked out the most evident substructures .",
    "notice that the observed mismatch is only marginally statistically significant ( @xmath210 ) .",
    "for a couple of clusters , namely a520 and a2163 , we find that the exclusion of the unrelaxed central regions avoids observational biases due to the presence of local substructures : in particular the mass of the first ( second ) object increases by a factor of @xmath211 ( @xmath212 ) when excluding the central 300 ( 360 ) kpc . for other clusters which are evidently unrelaxed , we did not find any convenient way to avoid possible biases : even after masking out the most visible substructures , the analysis of the density and deprojected temperature profiles still reveals the possible presence of local irregularities ( a sort of local ` jumps ' in the profiles ) , which are difficult to individuate in the brightness image .    at @xmath190 ,",
    "the best fitting normalization obtained considering the whole sample is @xmath213 per cent below the value found in the non - radiative hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite ; to @xmath190 . ] for the cc - only subsample , the normalization is @xmath214 per cent below the theoretical value .",
    "the discrepancy is slightly reduced ( @xmath215 per cent ) with respect to the adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite .",
    "the picture emerging from numerical simulations with a more sophisticated icm modeling is different .",
    "the simulation by @xcite , which includes radiative processes , supernova feedback , galactic winds and star formation , suggests a normalization which is in rough agreement with our whole sample , and 15 per cent lower with respect to the cc - only subsample .",
    "notice , however , that the re - analysis of the same simulation data made by @xcite , who adopted a different definition of temperature , the spectroscopic - like one ( which is not consistent with our definition of mass - weighted temperature ; see above for a more detailed discussion ) , gives a higher ( @xmath216 per cent ) normalization .",
    "finally we notice that the slope of the @xmath14 relation is , indeed , in agreement with the theoretical expectations ( @xmath217 ) .    considering the results at an overdensity of @xmath77",

    "our analysis suggests no evolution ( @xmath219 , @xmath220 ) , in agreement with the literature .",
    "we compare also our intrinsic scatter , which is consistent with zero , with the one estimated by @xcite : they find a scatter of @xmath221 per cent by considering the emission - weighted ( spectroscopic - like ) temperature .",
    "we reach similar conclusions comparing our intrinsic scatter with the value retrieved by @xcite .",
    "we find ( see the upper - right panel of fig .",
    "[ l - t3rela ] ) a marginal agreement of our results on the slope of this relation ( @xmath222 ) , with those obtained by , who found @xmath223 at @xmath190 : however , their sample contains colder objects , for which a flatter relation would be expected .",
    "our results also agree with the analysis made by @xcite : @xmath224 .",
    "notice that his cluster sample is not directly comparable with ours , since it covers different ranges in redshift and temperature .",
    "we compare our results about the scatter ( @xmath225 and @xmath226 ) with those obtained by @xcite , who found a smaller value : @xmath227 ( see , however , the previous comments on the different characteristics of the two samples ) .",
    "moreover , we find ( at @xmath228 ) a positive ( negative ) redshift evolution for all clusters ( cc - only subsample ) , i.e. we notice a mildly different behaviour on the evolution cc and ncc clusters .",
    "for comparison found @xmath229 for their sample of clusters at higher redshift .",
    "+ regarding the normalization we observe a slightly different behaviour when the cc - only subsample and whole sample are considered : @xmath230 and @xmath231 , respectively .",
    "we notice that the luminosity of the cc clusters is systematically larger than that of the ncc clusters , even if we have corrected it for the cooling flow ( see sect .",
    "[ phy ] ) , as already observed by .",
    "on the contrary numerical simulations predict that the removal of the gas from the x - ray emitting phase reduces the luminosity @xcite .",
    "this confirms that cooling @xcite is not effective in removing baryons from the x - ray phase , because of the presence of an extra - source of feedback or pre - heating @xcite , which maintains the icm at warm temperature @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the more evident negative evolution of the cc clusters compared to the ncc ones ( especially in the @xmath232x - ray(sz ) relations ) could indicate different states of relaxation , being the former more regular , relaxed and virialized than the latter @xcite .      here",
    "we discuss our results for the relations not shown in the figures . for the @xmath7 relation",
    "we find a @xmath233 discrepancy between the slope of this relation in the cc - only subsample ( @xmath234 and @xmath235 ) and the theoretical expectation for the self - similar model ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "nevertheless , our estimate is consistent with the results already present in the literature . by applying a @xmath23-model to recover the gas mass , @xcite measured @xmath237 at the baryon overdensity 1000 ( approximately corresponding to the virial dm overdensity ) .",
    "our slope is also in good agreement with the value ( @xmath238 ) found by @xcite , always by applying the @xmath23-model .",
    "we have also a marginal agreement ( at @xmath239 level ) with the value found by ( @xmath240 ) , who make use of the @xmath23-model and apply the correction for @xmath241 . finally , combining a spectral analysis and the application of a @xmath23-model to the brightness distribution and without correcting for @xmath241 ,",
    "found @xmath242 for @xmath190 and @xmath243 at @xmath195 .",
    "the results of this last paper also suggest a low intrinsic scatter , in good agreement with our analysis ( @xmath244 ) .",
    "we point out here that we find some differences between cc and ncc clusters at @xmath190 , because of the contribution of the cooling core region ( @xmath245 kpc ) ; at @xmath195 this effect becomes negligible because the behaviour of the gas mass is dominated by the contribution from the external regions ( @xmath246 ) .",
    "finally no significant evolution is observed ( @xmath247 ) for the cc clusters ; when we consider the whole sample , we notice a more significant positive evolution ( @xmath248 )    regarding the @xmath6 the best - fit slope for the cc - only subsample ( @xmath249 ) is in good agreement with the results obtained by @xcite ( @xmath250 ) , ( @xmath251 ) and ( @xmath252 ) . the observed scatter we measure ( @xmath253 , @xmath254 ) is slightly smaller than in previous analysis by @xcite ( @xmath255 ) , and in agreement with ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "this seems to suggest that the methods we applied to correct the observed luminosity ( see sect .",
    "[ phy ] ) and to determine the total mass are quite robust .",
    "hints of negative evolution are observed ( @xmath257 , @xmath258 ) .    for the @xmath186 law",
    "we measure a slope which is discrepant with respect to the theoretical value expected in the self - similar model .",
    "this relation , together with the one between @xmath7 and @xmath188 , has the lowest intrinsic scatter between the x - ray only scaling laws .",
    "moreover we have a significant evidence of a negative redshift evolution .      in this section ,",
    "we discuss first the @xmath259 and @xmath260 relations , which are linking the sz properties only ( see fig .",
    "[ y_0-relasz ] ) , and then the relations between sz and x - ray quantities ( see fig . [ y_0-rela ] ) .",
    "the importance of these relations relies on the possibility of providing new insights into the general physical properties of the icm , in a way complementary to the x - ray view .",
    "in particular , the different dependence on the gas density and temperature of the sz flux ( @xmath261 ) with respect to the x - ray brightness ( @xmath262 ) can allow to reduce some of the biases present in the x - ray analysis .",
    "the presence of substructures and inhomogeneities in the icm can indeed strongly affect some of the x - ray determined physical parameters , like temperature and luminosity .",
    "an independent approach through the sz analysis of some physical quantities can shed more light on the limits of validity of the icm self - similar scenario .      for both relations , we find slopes which are smaller than the expected ones .",
    "the discrepancy we measure is larger than the one found by @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the self - similar model predicts a pressure profile which is steeper than the observed one : including extra - gravitational energy draws a picture in which the gas density ( and consequently the pressure ) has a profile shallower than the dm density .",
    "this is also confirmed by the observation that there are differences between cc ( which are obviously more subject to non - gravitational processes ) and ncc clusters , having the former a slightly ( @xmath264 ) smaller integrated compton parameter .",
    "we point out that the dispersion in these relations is very high , probably because of the systematics on the reconstruction of the integrated compton parameter ( see sect .",
    "[ thsz0 ] ) .",
    "we measure a a strong negative evolution in the @xmath260 relation . as pointed as @xcite ,",
    "this different behaviour of the @xmath260 relation ( more in general of the @xmath232x - ray and @xmath232sz relations ) concerning the evolution is likely due to the fact the sz effect within a fixed angular size samples larger physical region at higher redshifts .",
    "this means that the effect of non - gravitational processes are relatively more pronounced if the sz flux is measured within smaller physical radii , where the density of the icm is higher : this is expected in a scenario of either preheating , where we can assign a fixed extra - energy per particle , or cooling , where the radiative cooling is more prominent in the denser central regions .",
    "this is also in agreement with the general picture emerging by studying entropy profiles , which is affected just in the central regions by non - gravitational processes , while the self - similarity is roughly preserved in the halo outskirt , where the dynamics is still dominated by the gravity .",
    "we note that @xmath8 is the only scaling relation that deviates by @xmath267 from the self - similar slope ( see table  4 and 5 ) both when only cc clusters and cc+ncc objects are considered .",
    "moreover , we measure an higher normalization in the cc - only subsample , probably due to the inclusion of the cooling regions during the sz data reduction and the subsequent fit in the visibility plane . these results , in good agreement with the ones presented in @xcite , are consistently obtained with both a robust bces fit and a @xmath33-minimization . by applying the former technique ,",
    "this relation is also the one that shows the smaller scatter ( both total and intrinsic ) around the best - fit .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath33-approach indicates a significant negative evolution among the 11 cc clusters ( @xmath268 at @xmath269 ; @xmath270 with 8 d.o.f . ) that disappears when the whole sample of 24 objects is considered . for the ncc sources we do observe hints of positive evolution ( @xmath271 ) : this points to a different behaviour of the cool core and non - cool clusters in the central regions , and different state of relaxation of the gas as suggested by the comparison of the normalization of the fit ( @xmath272 and @xmath273 ) .",
    "the best - fitting relations for @xmath265 show a value for the slope in agreement with the value predicted by the self - similar model either when we consider the cc - only clusters or the whole sample , unlike for the @xmath8 relation : this is probably due to the sensitivity of @xmath4 to the cooling region . on the contrary for the @xmath266 relation ,",
    "when we consider the cc clusters , we observe a good agreement with the self - similar predictions ( @xmath274 @xmath275 ) .",
    "our results confirms that the @xmath265 relation exhibits a smaller scatter than the @xmath8 one , as naively expected .",
    "finally we find that the @xmath266 relation has a larger scatter than the @xmath265 one , in contrast with what obtained by @xcite .",
    "moreover we notice in the cc - only subsample a mildly larger scatter compared to the whole cluster sample .",
    "these relations show a very good agreement between observed and self - similar slopes , with a scatter a factor of 2 larger than the correlation with @xmath2 ( see the previous subsection ) .",
    "we do not confirm the low scatter , @xmath279 per cent , for the @xmath277 relation suggested from the numerical simulations by @xcite and @xcite : this indicate possible bias in the determination of @xmath116 .",
    "but it is possible that the present simulations are not completely adequate to reproduce the observed quantities , being the icm modeling in hydrodynamical codes quite complex .",
    "the normalization of the @xmath280 relation has been investigated in dedicated hydrodynamical simulations to discriminate between different icm physics .",
    "for example , @xcite uses non - radiative ( nr ) and with gas cooling and star formation ( csf ) simulated clusters to find a normalization that varies by about 70 per cent : for a typical cluster with @xmath281 , @xmath282 and @xmath283 at @xmath284 , corresponding to @xmath285 in eq.([ydelta - m1 ] ) , and we adopt his cosmological parameters . ] . at the same mass and overdensity , and fixing the slope to the self - similar model ,",
    "our observed normalization is : @xmath286 and @xmath287 for cc - only and all clusters , respectively . at @xmath288 ,",
    "the observed normalizations are @xmath289 and @xmath290 , systematically lower than the results in nagai ( 2006 ) ( @xmath291 and @xmath292 ) and more in agreement with the results by @xcite , that measure @xmath293 , @xmath294 and @xmath295 for non - radiative , cooling ( cool ) and pre - heating ( pre - heat ) simulations , respectively .",
    "we obtain , therefore , that our cc clusters , for which we obtain the most robust estimates of the total mass at the overdensity of @xmath44 ( see subsect .  [ m - tmwrela1 ] ) , well reproduce the distribution measured in the @xmath280 plane of the objects simulated including extra physical processes .",
    "similar conclusions can be drawn for @xmath296 and @xmath297 relations .",
    "finally , we find a negative evolution for the relations under examinations at @xmath298 confidence level for the cc - only clusters ( see table  5 ) .",
    "the slopes of the correlations tend , however , to deviate from the self - similar predictions more significantly than the measurements obtained with the robust fitting technique .",
    "if we fix the slope to the self - similar value @xmath299 in these relations between sz and x - ray quantities , we still obtain a negative evolution at @xmath300 confidence level .",
    "we note here that @xcite , on the contrary , does not find any hint of evolution in the @xmath277 relation .",
    "in general we find a good agreement between the best - fitted slope and the self - similar prediction . compared to other scaling relations , in these cases the intrinsic scatter is very small ( @xmath303 for the @xmath301 relation estimated in the cc - only subsample ) .",
    "we do not observe significant differences between cc and ncc clusters , being the estimates of luminosity corrected for the cooling core .    regarding the evolution , we find suggestions ( at @xmath304 level ) for a negative evolution in the @xmath302 relation ( @xmath305 ) .",
    "we observe instead positive evolution in the @xmath297 relation , @xmath306 , but negative evolution when we consider the ncc clusters ( @xmath307 ) .",
    "we have presented an analysis of x - ray and sz scaling relations of a sample of 24 galaxy clusters in the redshift range 0.14 - 0.82 , selected by having their sz measurements available in literature .",
    "we have analyzed the chandra exposures for these x - ray luminous objects .",
    "we have reconstructed their gas density , temperature and pressure profiles in a robust way .",
    "then , we have investigated the scaling relations holding between x - ray and sz quantities . by assuming an adiabatic self - similar model , we have corrected the observed quantities by the factor @xmath308 , neglecting the factor @xmath309 , checking that the final results do not change significantly in this way : so we can compare our results with the work in the literature .",
    "we have estimated the values of normalization , slope , observed and intrinsic scatters , and evolution to quantify the amplitude of the effects of the non - gravitational processes in the icm physics . in this sense ,",
    "the combined study of the sz and x - ray scaling relations and their evolution in redshift is a powerful tool to investigate the thermodynamical history in galaxy clusters .",
    "indeed , the departures from the self - similar predictions observed in some of the scaling laws studied in our work confirm that the simple adiabatic scenario is not wholly adequate to describe the physics of the x - ray luminous clusters , because it does not account for a further non - gravitational energy besides the potential one .",
    "we remind that our results are , by construction , more robust at @xmath43 , where no extrapolation is required and the determinations of the mass ( at least for cc clusters ) and the reconstruction of the integrated compton parameter are reliable .",
    "these results can be here summarized as follows .",
    "* we observe a good agreement of the normalization of the @xmath310 relation between our results and the ones obtained in hydrodynamical numerical simulations .",
    "the other x - ray scaling relations involving a direct propagation of the absolute value of the measured gas density show a steeper slope than expected from self - similar predictions .",
    "departures larger than @xmath311 are observed in the @xmath5 ( @xmath312 vs. @xmath313 ) , @xmath186 ( @xmath314 vs. @xmath315 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath316 vs. @xmath217 ) relations .",
    "these results are consistent with previous analysis on high-@xmath3 x - ray luminous galaxy clusters .",
    "* correlations between the investigated sz quantities and the gas temperature have the largest deviations from the slope predicted from the self - similar model and the lowest scatter among similar relations with different x - ray quantities .",
    "the measured scatter is comparable to what is observed in the relations between x - ray parameters .",
    "the @xmath317 relation shows the lowest total and intrinsic scatter both when cc clusters only and the whole sample are considered .",
    "* we observe a strong negative evolution in the @xmath232x - ray and @xmath232sz relations .",
    "a plausible explanation is that the sz effect within a fixed angular size samples larger physical region at higher redshifts .",
    "that means the effect of non - gravitational processes are relatively more pronounced within smaller physical radii . * the observed normalization of the @xmath280 relation in cooling - core clusters at @xmath190 , that provide the most robust estimates of the total masses in our cluster sample , agrees well with the predicted value from numerical simulations ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , we confirm the trend that lower normalization are expected when some feedback processes take place in the cluster cores : for a cluster with typical @xmath318 , we measure @xmath286 in the sample of cc objects where the cooling activity is expected to be very effective , and @xmath319 in the whole sample . however , we have to note that the normalization in hydrodynamical simulations is strictly related to the adopted recipes to describe physical processes , like gas cooling and star formation .",
    "these processes are also responsible for the production of the cold baryon fraction , the amount of which is still under debate when compared to the observational constraints ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . * the sz  x - ray relations are , in general , well described by a self - similar model parametrized through the dependence upon @xmath320 , when a robust fitting technique , that considers both the intrinsic scatter and the errors on the two variables , is adopted . on the contrary , when an evolution in the form @xmath180 is investigated by a @xmath33-minimization with error propagations on both @xmath162 and @xmath116 variables , we measure a strong negative evolution at @xmath321 level of confidence for all relations that involve sz quantities ( @xmath322 ) and the x - ray measured gas temperature and total mass .",
    "the slopes of the correlation tend , however , to deviate from the self - similar predictions more significantly than the measurements obtained with the robust fitting technique .",
    "if we fix the slope to the self - similar value @xmath299 in these relations between sz and x - ray quantities , we obtain stronger hints of negative evolution for the @xmath323 relation ( @xmath324 ) and for the @xmath280 relation ( @xmath325 ) .",
    "our results on the x - ray and sz scaling relations show a tension between the quantities more related to the global energy of the system ( e.g. gas temperature , gravitating mass ) and the indicators of the icm structure ( e.g. gas density profile , central compton parameter @xmath4 ) .",
    "indeed , by using a robust fitting technique , the most significant deviations from the values of the slope predicted from the self - similar model are measured in the @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath326 , @xmath8 relations . when the slope is fixed to the self - similar value ,",
    "these relations show consistently a negative evolution suggesting a scenario in which the icm at higher redshift has lower both x - ray luminosity and pressure in the central regions than the self - similar expectations .",
    "these effects are more evident in relaxed cc clusters in the redshift range 0.14 - 0.45 , where a more defined core is present and the assumed hypotheses on the state of the icm are more reliable .",
    "a likely explanation is that we need an increase in the central entropy to spread the distribution of the gas on larger scales : this could be achieved either by episodes of non - gravitational heating due to supernovae and agn ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "moreover the values of @xmath379 are not independent : in fact we relate the deconvolved temperature , gas density and spectra normalization of the outermost shell to its observed values and then we compute the physical parameters in the @xmath367-th annulus by opportunely accounting for the contributions of the @xmath381-th shell ( @xmath404 ) : this could propagate possible systematic errors from the external regions , where the determination of the physical properties can not be so adequate because of the bad statistic .",

    "mclaughlin ( 1999 ) partially corrected this bias by referring the density to an average radius , @xmath407 .    here",
    "we introduce a new definition of the volume , the effective volume @xmath408 , which takes into account the real gradient of the physical parameters as a function of the radius .",
    "we assumed that we are weighting the unknown physical parameter @xmath409 in the @xmath328-th shell using a function @xmath410 , whose gradient is only due to the case of the squared density ( @xmath411 ) .",
    "we have modeled the density inside the @xmath328-th shell as a local power - law , @xmath412 , where @xmath413 , @xmath414 , @xmath415 .",
    "we first calculated @xmath416 by relying on the initial density obtained from the geometric volume - deprojection on a radius @xmath417 : in this way the introduced errors on @xmath164 are negligible ( @xmath418 ) .",
    "we define @xmath419 as the projection of @xmath40 on the sky plane , with @xmath420 , being @xmath3 the distance along the line of the sight .",
    "so , if @xmath421 is the density in the @xmath328-th shell , the observed parameter @xmath422 is related to the theoretical one by : @xmath423 so we can re - write the effective volume @xmath408 as : @xmath424    the effective volume @xmath330 is equal to the geometric one @xmath425 if @xmath426 , i.e. when we have negligible gradients of @xmath427 in the @xmath328-th shell .",
    "this is approximately true only in the case in which we have a good spatial resolution , for example when we consider @xmath26 annuli ( @xmath428 ) in the brightness image ( see section [ depr ] ) .",
    "but this is false when we have @xmath29 annuli , with @xmath359 ( @xmath360 ) in the spectral analysis , for which a larger statistics ( at least @xmath350 2000 net counts per annulus ) is required . in this last case , for example",
    ", it is possible to underestimate the true density in the external regions by @xmath429 per cent by using the geometrical volume instead of the effective one : this corresponds to set @xmath430 equal to @xmath431 ( being @xmath431 the identity matrix ) in eq.([p ] ) , and @xmath432 ( see eq .",
