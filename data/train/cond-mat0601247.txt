    "<S> in this paper we report comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigation of magnetic and electronic properties of the intermetallic compounds pr@xmath0fe@xmath1 and gd@xmath0fe@xmath1 . for the first time electronic structure of these two systems </S>",
    "<S> was probed by optical measurements in the spectral range of 0.2215 @xmath2 m . on top of that charge carriers parameters ( </S>",
    "<S> plasma frequency @xmath3 and relaxation frequency @xmath4 ) and optical conductivity @xmath5 were determined . </S>",
    "<S> self - consistent spin - resolved bandstructure calculations within the conventional lsda+u method were performed . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical interpetation of the experimental @xmath5 dispersions indicates transitions between @xmath6 and @xmath7 states of fe ions to be the biggest ones . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively the line shape of the theoretical optical conductivity coincides well with our experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> calculated by lsda+u method magnetic moments per formula unit are found to be in good agreement with observed experimental values of saturation magnetization . </S>"
