    "human behavior , as an academic issue in science , has a history of about one century from watson @xcite . as a joint interest of sociology , psychology and economics ,",
    "human behavior has been extensively investigated during the last decades . however , due to the complexity and diversity of our behaviors , the in - depth understanding of human activities is still a long - standing challenge thus far .",
    "actually , in most of the previous works , the individual activity pattern is usually simplified as a completely random point - process , which can be well described by the poisson process , leading to an exponential interevent time distribution @xcite . that is to say , the time difference between two consecutive events should be almost uniform , and the long gap is hardly to be observed .",
    "however , recently , the empirical studies on e - mail @xcite and surface mail @xcite communication show a far different scenario : those communication patterns follow non - poisson statistics , characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring events separated by long gaps .",
    "correspondingly , the interevent time distribution has a much heavier tail than the one predicted by an exponential distribution .",
    "the heavy tails have also been observed in many other human behaviors @xcite , including market transaction @xcite , web browsing @xcite , movie watching @xcite , short message sending @xcite , and so on .",
    "the increasing evidence of non - poisson statistics of human activity pattern highlights a question : what is the origin of those heavy tails ? based on the queuing theory , barabsi _ et al . _",
    "proposed a simple model @xcite where the individual executes the highest - priority task first , and they suggested the highest - priority - first ( hpf ) protocol a potential origin of those heavy tails .",
    "the queuing model gets a great success in explaining the heavy tails in many human - oriented dynamics .",
    "however , some other human activity patterns , also displaying the similar heavy - tailed phenomenon , could not be explained by a task - based mechanism .",
    "for example , the actions on browsing webs @xcite , watching on - line movies @xcite , and playing on - line games @xcite are mainly driven by the personal interests , which could not be treated as tasks needing to be executed .",
    "the in - depth understanding of the non - poisson statistics in those interest - driven systems requires a new model out of the perspective of queuing theory . in this paper , different from the mainstream task - based models",
    ", we propose an interest - based model . both the simulation and analysis indicate a power - law interevent time distribution with exponent -1 , which is in accordance with some empirical human - initiated systems .",
    "before introducing the mathematical rules of our model , let us think of the changing process of our interests on web browsing according to our daily experiences .",
    "if a person has a long period not browsing the web , an accidental visit may give him a good feeling and wake his interest on the web browsing .",
    "next , during the actions , the good feeling continues and the frequency of web browsing may increase . then , if the frequency is too high , he may worry about it , thus reduces those browsing actions .",
    "such similar experiences can be found in many other daily actions , such as playing games , seeing movies , and so on . in a word",
    ", we usually adjust the frequency of the daily actions according to our interest : greater interest will lead to higher frequency , and vice versa . some simple assumptions extracted from our daily experiences are as follows : firstly , for a given interest - driven behavior , each action will change the current interest , while the frequency of actions depends on the interest .",
    "it likes an active walker @xcite , whose motion is affected by the energy landscape , while the motion track could simultaneously change the landscape .",
    "secondly , the interevent time @xmath0 has two thresholds : when @xmath0 is too small ( i.e. , events happen too frequently ) , the interest will be depressed , thus the interevent time will increase ; while if the time gap is too long , we will increase the interest to mimic its resuscitation induced by a casual action .    according to those assumptions , we propose an interest - based model as follows : ( i ) the time is discrete and labelled by @xmath1 , the occurring probability of an event at time step @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "the time interval between two consecutive events is call the interevent time and denoted by @xmath0 .",
    "( ii ) if the @xmath4th event occurred at time step @xmath2 , the value of @xmath5 is updated as @xmath6 , where @xmath7",
    "if no event occurred at time step @xmath2 , we set @xmath8 , namely @xmath9 keeps unchanged . in this definition , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two thresholds satisfied @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the time interval between the @xmath4th and the @xmath14th events , and @xmath15 is a parameter controlling the changing rate of occurrence probability ( @xmath16 ) . if no event happens , @xmath5 will not change .",
    "clearly , simultaneously enlarge ( by the same multiple ) @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and the minimal perceptible time , the statistics of this system will not change . therefore , without lose of generality , we set @xmath19 .     time steps .",
    "( lower panel ) the corresponding changes of @xmath3 .",
    "the data points are obtained with the parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21.,title=\"fig:\",width=325 ] +",
    "in the simulations , the initial value of @xmath5 is set as @xmath22 , which is also the possibly maximal value of @xmath3 in the whole simulation process . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the succession of events predicted by the present model exhibits very long inactive periods that separate the bursts of rapidly occurring events , and the corresponding @xmath3 shows a clearly seasonal property ( quasi - periodic behavior ) . actually , in a period , the maximal and minimal values of @xmath3 respectively determined by @xmath17 and @xmath18 as @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this quasi - periodic property will be applied in the further analysis .",
    "note that , in a specific quasi - period , @xmath25 can be smaller than @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be smaller than @xmath28 .",
    "it is because @xmath29 could happen when @xmath30 and @xmath31 could happen when @xmath32 .",
    "figure 2 reports the simulation results with tunable @xmath18 and @xmath33 . given @xmath34 , if @xmath35 , the interevent time distribution generated by the present model displays a clearly power law with exponent -1 ; while if @xmath18 is not sufficiently large , the distribution @xmath36 exhibits a departure from a power - law form with a cut - off in its tail .",
    "correspondingly , given sufficiently large @xmath18 , the effect of @xmath33 is very slight , thus can be ignored .    ,",
    "@xmath36 for different @xmath11 , where the black , red and green curves denote the cases of @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "( b ) given @xmath21 , @xmath36 for different @xmath15 , where the black , red and green curves denote the cases of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the black dash lines in both ( a ) and ( b ) have slope -1 .",
    "each distribution contains @xmath43 events . ,",
    "title=\"fig:\",width=325 ] +    taking into account the quasi - periodic property of @xmath3 , we raise two approximated assumptions before analytical derivation : ( i ) the statistical property of @xmath36 is the same as that in a single period ; ( ii ) within one period , the statistical property of @xmath36 in the @xmath5-increasing half is the same as that in the @xmath5-decreasing half . in the reducing process , @xmath44 , where @xmath45 .",
    "the integer @xmath46 denotes the number of the events in the reducing process ( also the number of different values of @xmath3 ) , whose value is about @xmath47 since @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath48 is the initial value ( it is also the maximum value ) of @xmath3 in a reducing process .",
    "note that , for different reducing processes , the values of @xmath48 are not always the same . though @xmath49 has the same order of magnitude with @xmath50 , its value can be less than @xmath51 in a specific process .",
    "the average value of @xmath48 will be calculated later in this paper .",
    "if the current occurring probability is @xmath52 , the probability that the next event will happen at the time @xmath53 is : @xmath54 considering every value of @xmath3 in the reducing process , the interevent time distribution of the reducing process is : @xmath55 according to the approximated assumptions above , the interevent time distribution of all the successions can also be expressed by eq . ( 4 ) , which can be approximately rewritten in a continuous form , as : @xmath56 therefore , @xmath36 can be further expressed as : @xmath57(\\ln a_{0})^{-1}i^{-1}\\tau^{-1}.\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( 6 ) , for a fixed @xmath48 , when @xmath46 is large enough ( it is equivalent to the condition @xmath58 ) , @xmath36 has a power - law tail with exponent -1 . in addition",
    ", this analytical result also provides an explanation about the departure from a power law when @xmath18 is not sufficiently large .    , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the analytical results are calculated by eq .",
    "( 6 ) with @xmath20 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the black dash line has slope -1 .",
    "the numerical results contain @xmath43 events .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=325 ] +    as discussed before , for different reducing processes of @xmath3 , the possible values of @xmath48 are not always the same ( see also the lower panel of fig . 1 : for different quasi - periods , the maximum values of @xmath3 are different ) .",
    "since the order of magnitude of @xmath48 is comparable with @xmath50 ( it is equal to @xmath61 ) , the minimum value of @xmath3 , @xmath62 , has the same order of magnitude with @xmath63 . making the approximated assumption that the minimum value of @xmath3 is given by @xmath63 in a @xmath5-increasing process , and the maximum value of @xmath3 in the next @xmath5-decreasing process is @xmath64 ( @xmath64 is also the start point in the next decreasing process ) , then the probability density of @xmath65 reads @xmath66 therefore",
    ", the average value of @xmath48 is @xmath67 this average value of @xmath48 calculated by eq .",
    "( 8) , as well as the integer part of @xmath68 ( as the approximation of @xmath46 ) , can be directly used in the approximate calculations of eq .",
    "given @xmath69 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath70 , one obtains @xmath71 , and @xmath72 by eq .",
    "( 8) . accordingly , fig .",
    "3 reports the comparison of analytical and simulation results , which are well in accordance with each other .",
    "a novel model on human dynamics is proposed in this paper .",
    "different from the mainstream queuing models , the current model is driven by the personal interests . in this model ,",
    "the frequency of events are determined by the interest , while the interest are simultaneously affected by the occurrence of events .",
    "this interplay working mechanism , similar to the active walk @xcite , is a genetic origin of complexity of many real - life systems .",
    "the rules in the current model are extracted from our daily life , and both the analytical and simulation results agree well with the empirical observation , such as the activity pattern of web browsing @xcite .",
    "our work indicates a simple and universal mechanism in human dynamics , that is , a people could adaptively adjust their interest on a specific behavior ( e.g. watching tv , browsing web , playing on - line game , etc . ) , which leads to a quasi - periodic change of interest , and this quasi - periodic property eventually gives raise to the departure of poisson statistics .    besides the hpf protocol and the current model , there are also some other mechanisms that can lead to a power - law interevent time distribution .",
    "for example , hidalgo @xcite pointed out that a poissonian individual with characteristic time varying randomly in time could generate a power - law interevent time distribution with exponent -2 .",
    "in addition , vzquez @xcite showed that if the current executing rate is linearly correlated with the average executing rate in a immediate predecessor period , the interevent time distribution will follow a power - law form .",
    "note that , although in the recent empirical works , the power - law form is widely used to fit the interevent time distribution of human behaviors , there exists a debate about the choice of fitting functions for this distribution in the e - mail communication @xcite .",
    "actually , a candidate , namely _ log - normal distribution _ , has also been suggested @xcite to describe the non - poisson temporal statistics of human activities .",
    "the _ stretched exponential distribution _",
    "@xcite , interpolating between a power law and an exponential form , serves as another candidate ( see , for example , the distribution of interevent time between two consecutive transactions initiated by a stock broker @xcite ) . a clear understanding of the tails in the interevent time distribution asks for in - depth exploration on empirical data in the future .",
    "the concept and methodologies related to the statistics of the interevent time can also find its applications in some other systems .",
    "for example , similar statistical analysis can be addressed on the spacing between the consecutive occurrences of the same letter in written text @xcite , and the time difference between successive events above a certain threshold ( i.e. , extreme events ) @xcite .    finally , we point out some limitations in the current model .",
    "firstly , it can only generate the power - law interevent time distribution with exponent -1 , which does not agree with some real human - initiated systems with different power - law exponents .",
    "secondly , we assume that the changing rate of the occurring probability , @xmath33 , is fixed as a constant in every rising or decaying process .",
    "this assumption is very ideal , and we could not find any support from the empirical data .",
    "third , as stated by kentsis @xcite , there are countless ingredients affecting the human dynamics , and for most of them , we do not know their impacts .",
    "those ingredients , such as the social content , the semantic content and the periodicity due to circadian and weekly cycles , have not been considered in the present model , neither the hpf protocol . however , although this model is rough and may contain some artificial assumptions , it provides a start point of modeling interest - based human dynamics .",
    "the human - initiated systems are the most complex systems , and there must be many underlying mechanisms having not been discovered yet .",
    "we believe our model could highlight the readers in this rapidly growing area .",
