    "there is the issue of the vdvz discontinuity @xcite , the prediction that for a massive graviton , light deflection is greater than in general relativity by the factor 4/3 , no matter how small the mass .",
    "if this were true , despite its paradoxical nature , then classical tests of starlight deflection would rule out massive gravitons .",
    "but recently , resolutions have been proposed to the vdvz paradox , so that massive gravitons can not be ruled out @xcite .    on the theoretical side also",
    ", advances in higher - dimensional theories have led to graviton mass - like features ( e.g. , dgp model by @xcite ) ; meanwhile , because of possible issues with standard gravitation from solar system scale @xcite to cosmological scale @xcite , interest has been growing in alternative gravity theories , some of which predict massive gravitons @xcite . there is , therefore , considerable motivation for experimental or observational tests of whether the graviton can be massive .    the literature contains many estimates for an upper limit on the graviton mass , estimates that differ by many orders of magnitude .",

    "these upper limits are all of value , since they are based on different assumptions about the phenomenological effects of graviton mass . most of the estimates are based on the effects of graviton mass on the static field of a source , typically assuming a yukawa potential , though this may not be the general case for a particular theory of gravity , such as fifth force theories , or mond - type theories @xcite . in view of the lack of a theory of the graviton , it is important to have upper limits based on different phenomenological implications of graviton mass .",
    "the mass limit of @xcite is based on the effect of graviton mass on the generation of gravitational waves , not on their propagation , but the dispersion relation for propagation is also an important independent approach to a mass limit , as has been recently suggested by a number of groups @xcite .",
    "questions about this method are timely since the detection of gravitational waves is expected in the near future , thanks to the progress with present ground - based laser interferometers , possible future space - based interferometers @xcite , and pulsar timing array projects @xcite .",
    "the pulsar timing array is a unique technique to detect nano - hertz gravitational waves by timing millisecond pulsars , which are very stable celestial clocks .",

    "two features of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : avs ] are worth noting .",
    "first , the minimal detection amplitude of a gw background becomes larger , when a massive graviton is present , i.e. , the leading edge of the @xmath123-@xmath129 curve shifts rightwards as @xmath130 is made larger .",
    "this tells us that in order to detect a massive gw background one needs a stronger gw background signal or a smaller pulsar intrinsic noise than in the case of a massless gw background .",
    "as previously noted , this effect is mainly due to the reduction of the pulsar timing response and the reduction of the gravitational wave amplitude at lower frequencies .",
    "[ fig : avs ] also tells us when we can neglect the effect of a massive graviton .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : avs ] that if @xmath131 ev for a 5-year observation , the minimal detection amplitude is not reduced by more than 5% . for 10 years of observation a 5% reduction corresponds to @xmath132 ev .",
    "the second noteworthy feature of the @xmath123-@xmath129 curves in fig .  [ fig : avs ] is that of the saturation level of detection significance . due to the pulsar distance term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rbk ] ) ( the term involving the @xmath133 ) , the detection significance achieves a saturation level when the gw induced timing residuals are much stronger than the intrinsic pulsar timing noise @xcite . from fig .",
    "[ fig : avs ] , we note that the saturation level of detection significance is large , when the graviton is massive , i.e. , the plateau at the right part of the @xmath123-@xmath129 curve becomes higher for a more massive graviton .",
    "this is rather similar to the whitening filter discussed by @xcite .",
    "the graviton mass introduces a low frequency spectral cut - off , which is equivalent to applying a whitening filter to the timing signals . in this way , the saturation level of @xmath123 starts to grow for a massive gw background . because the cut - off in the frequency domain coherently removes low frequency gw components , the envelope of the these @xmath123-@xmath129 curves is similar to the curves with the whitening filter as described by @xcite .",
    "in  [ sec : sigdec ] , we have discussed how the detection significance for the stochastic gw background is affected by the graviton mass . here",
    "we formulate the qustion as a detection problem rather than a parameter estimation problem . in this section",
    ", we will construct a detector , which accepts pulsar timing array data and then determines if the gravitational wave background is massless or massive .",
    "then we simulate pulsar timing data , passing through the detector , to determine the quality of such detector . with the detector quality , we then discusse related technical requirements ( the number of pulsars , the pulsar noise level , and so on ) for performing such detections .",
    "the question , whether the graviton mass is zero or not , is best formulated as a statistical hypothesis test composed of two hypotheses f and h given by    @xmath134    the detection algorithm determines which hypothesis is accepted .",

    "the quality of the detection algorithm is evaluated by calculating the relation between the detection rate @xmath135 and the false alarm rate @xmath137 . here",

    "we fix @xmath140 .",

    "[ sec : hel ] , the graviton mass changes the shape of the correlation function .",
    "the best way to detect such a difference is to use following statistics @xcite @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the correlation function for a massless gw background , and @xmath143 is the correlation function for a massive gw background , which maximizes the detection significance @xmath123 among possible theoretical correlation functions for all possible values of @xmath130 .",
    "one can show that the optimal statistical decision rule is @xcite ,    @xmath144    where the @xmath145 is the threshold of statistical decision , which is determined to guarantee the false alarm rate constraint @xmath146 .",

    "after we determined the @xmath145 , a fourth monte - carlo simulation is used to calculated @xmath135 .",
    "this simulation is very similar to the previous one , except that a _ massive _ gw background is generated .",
    "we repeat the simulation @xmath150 times and take as @xmath135 the probability of getting @xmath148 .",

    "the corresponding parameters are given in the legend of each panel . intuitively , the necessary conditions for a positive detection of a graviton mass should be first , that the gw is strong enough for the gw to be detected , and second , that the graviton mass is large enough to change the shape of correlation function .",
    "this intuition is confirmed by our simulations , which show that the high detection rate concentrates in the upper right corner of each panel , where both graviton mass and gw amplitude are large enough .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : decprob ] we can also see that we need at least 60 pulsars to be able to tell the difference between a massive gw background and a massless one . for 5-year observations of 100 pulsars we can start to detect a graviton heavier than @xmath151 ev and we can achieve a limit of @xmath152 ev by using 5-year observations of 300 pulsars .",

    "current efforts to detect gravitational waves using radio pulsar observations make use of correlated arrival time fluctuations induced by the presence of a stochastic gw background .",
    "einstein s general theory of relativity makes a specific prediction for the angular dependence of the correlation .",
    "the power spectrum of the induced fluctuations is given by the power spectrum of the gravitational wave background , determined by the physical processes of the generation process , divided by the square of the gw frequency .",
    "in this paper , we showed that the form of the expected correlation function , as well as the power spectrum of the induced timing fluctuations , will be significantly altered if the graviton had a non - zero mass .",

    "a non - zero graviton mass introduces a cut - off frequency below which no gws will propagate .",

    ", we are assuming that the background is being generated by an ensemble of supermassive black hole binaries .",
    "this effect is due to the fact that the presence of the graviton mass will act to flatten out the spectrum of the induced time residuals ( see eq .",

    ", the cut - off frequency will increase .",
    "once this cut - off frequency is above the inverse of the observing time , the sensitivity starts to fall of dramatically .",
    "this is due to the fact that pulsar timing is most sensitive to the lowest observable frequencies and the presence of a massive graviton removes all gravitational wave power at frequencies below the cut - off frequency .",
    "a non - zero graviton mass will also change the shape of the angular dependent correlation function . in order to understand this ,",
    "consider two gw waves traveling near the direction of the line of sight between the earth and a given pulsar .",
    "one gw is traveling towards the pulsar , and the other is traveling towards the earth .",
    "the induced timing fluctuations will be very different for each of these waves .",

    "hence , both waves induce the same timing fluctuations .",
    "this symmetry between the two gw directions implies that the timing fluctuations from two pulsars near each other on the sky or @xmath153 apart will have the same amount of correlation , unlike the massless graviton case .",
    "thus , as the graviton mass increases , the correlation curve will become more symmetric about @xmath154 .",
    "since the graviton mass changes the expected correlation function , we can detect the massive graviton by measuring the shape of correlation function .",
    "the optimal detection algorithm differentiating between a massive and a massless gw background was constructed in this paper . using this algorithm",
    ", we found that at least 60 pulsars are required to discriminate between a gw background made up of massive and massless gravitons .",
    "note that , like the case of discriminating various polarization modes of gws @xcite , the minimum number of pulsars is insensitive to the intrinsic timing noise level or the total observing time .     here",
    ", we are mainly focusing on answering following question : what is the threshold of graviton mass , such that the detector , we constructed in the paper , will find out that the gw background is composed of massive gravitons rather than massless gravitons ?",
    "we answered this statistical detection question in this paper",
    ". the related parameter estimation question will be investigated in the future works .    in this paper",
    ", we treat the graviton mass in the sense of a gw dispersion relation .",
    "a better graviton mass upper limit ( @xmath155 ev ) can be achieved by observing the gw dispersion using laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite .",
    "besides gw dispersion based techniques , there are other good upper limits ( @xmath156 ev ) from galaxy cluster observations @xcite .",
    "however since some gravity theories @xcite contain mass terms for @xmath157 , but maintain the scalar sectors , the @xmath130 upper limits from gw dispersion observations are independent of the upper limits from yukawa potential experiments such as the solar system and the galaxy cluster observations .    in summary , for the task of detecting the massive graviton using a pulsar timing array , there is one critical requirement : a large sample of stable pulsars .",
    "thus the on - going and upcoming projects like the parkes pulsar timing array @xcite , european pulsar timing array @xcite , nanograv @xcite , the large european array for pulsars @xcite , the five - hundred - meter aperture spherical radio telescope @xcite and the square kilometer array ( ska ) will offer unique opportunities to find , to time these pulsars ; and to detect the gw background and measure its properties .",
