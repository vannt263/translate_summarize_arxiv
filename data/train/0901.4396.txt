    "evidence for the @xmath1 meson was first seen in 1981 @xcite . for the next two decades , the argus experiment operating at desy in hamburg , germany and the cleo experiment operating at cesr at cornell university studied the properties of these mesons and made many important discoveries including the discovery of  mixing .",
    "the first examples of charmless hadronic @xmath1 decays were seen by cleo @xcite .",
    "starting in 2000 , there have been many measurements of these decays with increasing precision by the babar experiment operating at pep - ii at slac in california and the belle experiment operating at kek in japan .",
    "there are now nearly 100 of these decays that have been observed with a statistical significance of at least four standard deviations .",
    "while the early measurements by cleo were groundbreaking , the errors are sufficiently large that they have little weight in the present world averages .",
    "the cdf experiment at fnal also has measurements for these decays . while they are nearly as precise as babar and belle , there are only measurements for four decay channels .",
    "thus in tables throughout this review , we concentrate on the copious measurements from belle and babar .",
    "the theoretical study of weak nonleptonic decays of a heavy meson is difficult and involved due to the interplay of short- and long - distance qcd effects .",
    "the effective weak hamiltonian at the quark level @xmath2 is theoretically well under control , where @xmath3 are four - quark operators and @xmath4 are the wilson coefficients which incorporate strong - interaction effects above the scale @xmath5 .",
    "however , it is a difficult task to evaluate the hadronic matrix elements of the local operator @xmath3 reliably due to the nonperturbative qcd effects involved .",
    "a simple and widely employed approach is based on the valence quark assumption and the vacuum - insertion ( or factorization ) approximation in which the hadronic matrix elements of two quark bilinear operators are saturated by the vacuum intermediate states . due to the experimental and theoretical efforts in the past decade ,",
    "qualitative understanding of nonleptonic charmless @xmath1 decays has become possible .",
    "since the @xmath1 meson is heavy , it is possible to describe the dynamics of hadronic decays by theories motivated by qcd rather than by phenomenological models .",
    "a central aspect of those theories is the factorization theorem which allows us to disentangle short - distance qcd dynamics from nonperturbative hadronic effects . in the heavy quark limit",
    ", matrix elements can be expressed in terms of certain nonperturbative input quantities such as light cone distribution amplitudes and transition form factors .",
    "power corrections beyond the heavy quark limit generally give the major theoretical uncertainties .    in this article",
    "we give an overview of the experimental measurements and the theoretical understanding of the branching fractions and @xmath0-violating asymmetries of charmless @xmath1-meson decays .",
    "we begin with the theoretical and experimental tools necessary for the study of hadronic @xmath1 decays .",
    "this is followed with a discussion of 2-body , 3-body , quasi-2-body , and baryonic @xmath1 decays , and the status of time - dependent @xmath0-violation measurements and predictions .",
    "we discuss the puzzles that remain unsolved .",
    "in this section we will introduce various approaches that have been employed for studying the dynamics of hadronic @xmath6 decays . in the effective hamiltonian approach ,",
    "the decay amplitude is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 are cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) @xcite matrix elements , @xmath3 are four - quark operators and @xmath4 are the wilson coefficients which incorporate strong - interaction effects above the scale @xmath5 . a major theoretical issue is how to evaluate the matrix elements of the four - quark operators @xmath9 .",
    "a widely used approximation is the so - called  naive factorization \" or  vacuum - insertion approximation \" under which the matrix element @xmath10 is approximated by @xmath11 or @xmath12 with @xmath13 being a bilinear current ; that is , the matrix element of a four - quark operator is expressed as a product of a decay constant and a form factor .",
    "naive factorization is simple but fails to describe color - suppressed modes .",
    "for example , the predicted ratio of @xmath14 is too small compared with the experimental value of 0.55 @xcite .",
    "this is ascribed to the fact that color - suppressed decays receive sizable nonfactorizable contributions that have been neglected in naive factorization .",
    "another issue is that the decay amplitude under naive factorization is not truly physical because the renormalization scale and scheme dependence of @xmath4 are not compensated by that of the matrix element @xmath15 . in the improved ",
    "generalized factorization \" approach @xcite , nonfactorizable effects are absorbed into the parameter @xmath16 , the effective number of colors .",
    "this parameter can be empirically determined from experiment .",
    "since these early calculations have been replaced with improved ones discussed below , we will not discuss these early calculations .      with the advent of heavy quark effective theory ,",
    "nonleptonic @xmath1 decays can be analyzed systematically within the qcd framework .",
    "there are three popular approaches available in this regard : qcd factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite , perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) @xcite and soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of these theories goes beyond the scope of this review , and the interested reader is referred to the original literature .",
    "basically , theories of hadronic @xmath1 decays are based on the  factorization theorem \" under which the short - distance contributions to the decay amplitudes can be separated from the process - independent long - distance parts . in the qcdf approach ,",
    "nonfactorizable contributions to the hadronic matrix elements can be absorbed into the effective parameters @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath17 are basically the wilson coefficients in conjunction with short - distance nonfactorizable corrections such as vertex , penguin corrections and hard spectator interactions , and @xmath19 is the matrix element evaluated under the factorization ( or vacuum insertion ) approximation . for penguin operators @xmath20 , the current operators @xmath21 are replaced by the scalar or pseudoscalar densities . since power corrections of order @xmath22 are suppressed in the heavy quark limit , nonfactorizable corrections to nonleptonic decays are calculable . in the limits of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , naive factorization",
    "is recovered in both qcdf and pqcd approaches .",
    "power corrections are often plagued by the end - point divergence that in turn breaks the factorization theorem .",
    "for example , the endpoint divergence occurs at the twist-3 level for the hard spectator scattering amplitude and at the twist-2 level for the annihilation amplitude . as a consequence ,",
    "the estimate of power corrections is generally model dependent and can only be studied in a phenomenological way .",
    "there is also an endpoint singularity in scet though this issue can be resolved after introducing the zero - bin subtraction procedure @xcite . in the pqcd approach ,",
    "the endpoint singularity is cured by including the parton s transverse momentum .      because a reliable evaluation of hadronic matrix elements is very difficult in general , an alternative approach is based on the diagrammatic approach .",
    "it has been established that a least model - dependent analysis of heavy meson decays can be carried out in the so - called quark - diagram approach @xcite . in the diagrammatic approach ,",
    "all two - body nonleptonic weak decays of heavy mesons can be expressed in terms of six distinct quark diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qds ] ) : named in @xcite were originally denoted by @xmath25 , respectively , in @xcite . for the analysis of charmless @xmath1 decays , one adds the variants of the penguin diagram such as the electroweak penguin and the penguin annihilation . ]",
    "@xmath26 , the color - allowed external @xmath27-emission tree diagram ; @xmath28 , the color - suppressed internal @xmath27-emission diagram ; @xmath29 , the @xmath27-exchange diagram ; @xmath30 , the @xmath27-annihilation diagram ; @xmath31 , the penguin diagram ; and @xmath32 , the vertical @xmath27-loop diagram .",
    "it should be stressed that these quark diagrams are classified according to the topologies of weak interactions with all strong interaction effects included and hence they are _ not _ feynman graphs .",
    "all quark graphs used in this approach are topological with all the strong interactions included , i.e. gluon lines are included in all possible ways .",
    "the diagrammatic approach was applied to hadronic @xmath1 decays first in @xcite .",
    "various topological amplitudes have been extracted from the data in @xcite after making some reasonable approximations , e.g. , su(3 ) symmetry .",
    "the experimental measurements involve separation of small samples ( 102000 signal events ) from total samples of @xmath33  and light quark - pairs ( @xmath34 ) of several billion events .",
    "the background is typically dominated by the copious @xmath34  production , where the background after preliminary sample selection is often 1000 times larger than the signal .",
    "the separation of the signal from the large background relies on a number of variables that are common to all analyses . for signal",
    ", the mass of a candidate , reconstructed from the charged and neutral tracks in the event , is equal to the @xmath1 mass , approximately 5.28 gev / c@xmath35 .",
    "the center - of - mass energy of the candidate is equal to one - half of the @xmath36 rest energy since all @xmath37 @xmath1 experiments take advantage of the increased production rate of @xmath33  events at this resonance .",
    "finally there are several variables that take advantage of the difference in the shape of the signal and background events . in the center - of - mass system ,",
    "signal is typically spherical since the @xmath1 mesons are produced nearly at rest .",
    "the @xmath34  background events are are characterized by back - to - back  jets \" of particles with small transverse momentum with respect to the direction of the leading quarks . for @xmath1",
    "decays involving resonances in the final state ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , etc ) , the mass of the daughter particles from the decay of these resonances is also used .",
    "this is useful because the background often is dominated by events with combinatorial background , where the resonance candidate is not real but rather is composed of combinations of particles from the @xmath34  event that happen to have an invariant mass near that of the resonance . for spin-1 ( vector ) particles , the so - called helicity angle is also often useful since the decay of the daughters in the vector particle s rest frame is not typically uniform .",
    "most analyses combine some of the above quantities into a maximum likelihood ( ml ) fit .",
    "such a fit characterizes the signal and background with probability density functions ( pdfs ) that describe the distribution expected for each variable .",
    "it is the difference between the shapes of the signal and background pdfs that allow extraction of the signal from the very large backgrounds .",
    "the shape of these pdfs is typically determined from monte carlo ( mc ) simulation for signal and @xmath33  background events , with checks provided by ",
    "control \" samples of other more copious decays .",
    "the data itself is used to determine the pdfs for the @xmath34  background .",
    "the free variables in the ml fit typically include the yields of the signal and backgrounds , the value of @xmath0  violation parameters where relevant , the longitudinal polarization fraction for decays with two particles with non - zero spin , and often some of the parameters that determine the @xmath34  background shapes .",
    "the structure of the likelihood often assumes that the input observables are uncorrelated .",
    "this assumption is tested with data and mc and correlations are typically below 10% .",
    "the residual correlations may cause small signal biases ( @xmath4410% ) which are evaluated with mc and appropriate corrections are made .",
    "the general expressions of topological amplitudes are @xmath45 for tree - dominated @xmath46 decays , @xmath47 for @xmath48 decays , and @xmath49 for @xmath50 decays , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are color - allowed and color - suppressed electroweak penguin amplitudes , respectively , and @xmath53 is the penguin - induced weak annihilation amplitude .",
    "we use unprimed and primed symbols to denote @xmath54 and @xmath55 transitions .",
    "experimental results for branching fractions from babar and belle and theoretical predictions are summarized in fig .",
    "[ f:2-body ] . here and in the following tables , the theoretical values and errors are from weighted averages of the various predictions with the errors divided by @xmath56 since the quoted theory errors indicate a range as parameters are varied , not @xmath57 errors .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "2.2 , endpoint divergences will occur in the qcdf approach in the penguin annihilation and hard spectator scattering amplitudes , which are often parametrized as @xcite @xmath58 where the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are real and @xmath61 is a typical hadronic scale of order 500 mev .",
    "since these parameters are unknown within qcd factorization , the central values of qcdf predictions correspond to @xmath62 and the power corrections due to annihilation effects give the largest theoretical uncertainties .",
    "hence , for penguin - dominated modes , the central values predicted by qcdf are usually systematically below the measurements .",
    "penguin annihilation and hard spectator scattering amplitudes are calculable in the pqcd approach as the endpoint singularity is overcome by the parton s transverse momentum .",
    "the predicted central values by pqcd for penguin - dominated decays are normally higher than those of qcdf .",
    "the predicted @xmath63 branching fraction of @xmath64 is too large , whereas @xmath65 of order @xmath66 is too small compared with experiment ( the ratio of the branching fractions is predicted much more precisely than one would infer from fig .  [ f:2-body ] ) .",
    "if the penguin amplitudes @xmath31 , @xmath51 , @xmath53 and the annihilation @xmath29 are neglected , a fit to the ratio of @xmath67 and @xmath68 rates will yield @xmath69 . in the short - distance ( @xmath70 ) factorization approach , @xmath71 .",
    "it is thus a challenge to theorists to understand @xmath72 and @xmath63 decays .    as for @xmath48 decays , @xmath73 and @xmath74",
    "are dominated by the ckm - suppressed @xmath75 penguin , while @xmath76 proceeds only through weak annihilation .",
    "hence , the branching fraction is expected to be of order @xmath77 for the former and @xmath78 for the latter , in agreement with the data .",
    "the @xmath50 decays are dominated by penguin contributions because of @xmath79 and the large top quark mass . for the ratios defined by @xmath80 we have @xmath81 if the other quark - diagram amplitudes are negligible compared with @xmath82 .",

    "the rate sum rule is fairly well satisfied by experiment .",
    "it is well known that it requires at least two amplitudes with nontrivial relative strong and weak phases to produce direct @xmath0  violation .",

    "nonresonant amplitudes in charm decays are usually assumed to be uniform in phase space",

    "this explains the dominance of the nonresonant background in @xmath138 decays , the sizable nonresonant fraction in @xmath145 and @xmath146 modes and the smallness of nonresonant rates in @xmath142 decays .",

    "since @xmath241 has a rate much larger than @xmath242 , it is natural to expect that @xmath243 will receive large enhancement via isospin final - state interactions .",
    "the fact that the branching fraction of this mode is rather small and is consistent with the theory prediction implies that the isospin phase difference of @xmath244 and @xmath245 must be negligible and so is the final - state interaction @xcite .",

    "threshold enhancement was first conjectured by hou and soni @xcite .",
    "they argued that in order to have substantial branching fractions for baryonic @xmath1 decays , one has to reduce the energy release and at the same time allow for baryonic ingredients to be present in the final state .",

    "the interested reader is referred to @xcite for further details .",
    "naively it appears that the bremsstrahlung process will lead to @xmath321 , with @xmath322 being an electromagnetic fine - structure constant , and hence the radiative baryonic @xmath1 decay is further suppressed than the two - body counterpart , making its observation very difficult at the present level of sensitivity for @xmath1 factories .",
