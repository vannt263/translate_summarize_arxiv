    "star formation is a dynamical process where most stars form in a clustered ennvironment ( lada & lada  2003 ; clarke , bonnell & hillenbrand  2000 ) .",
    "in such an environment , stars and gas move in their combined potential on timescales comparable to the formation time of individual stars . furthermore , the initial fragmentation of a molecular cloud is very inefficient ( eg . , motte  1998 ) , such that the youngest clusters are dominated by their gas content .",
    "in such an environment , gas accretion can contribute significantly to the final mass of a star .",
    "stellar clusters are found to be mass segregated even from the youngest ages .",
    "the location of massive stars in the cores of clusters can not be explained by dynamical mass segregation as the systems are too young ( bonnell & davies  1998 ) .",
    "a jeans mass argument also fails as the jeans mass in the core should be lower then elsewhere in the cluster .",
    "mass segregation is a natural outcome of competitive accretion due to the gas inflow to the centre of the cluster potential .",
    "in a series of numerical experiments , we investigated the dynamics of accretion in gas - dominated stellar clusters ( bonnell  1997 ,  2001a ) . in the initial studies of accretion in small stellar clusters , we found that the gas accretion was highly non - uniform with a few stars accreting significantly more than the rest .",
    "this occurred as the gas flowed down to the core of the cluster and was there accreted by the increasingly most - massive star .",
    "other , less massive stars were ejected from the cluster and had their accretion halted ( see also bate , bonnell & bromm 2002 ) . in a follow - up study investigating accretion in clusters of 100 stars , we discovered two different physical regimes ( bonnell  2001a ) resulting in different accretion radii , @xmath2 , for the mass accretion rate @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the local gas density and @xmath5 is the relative velocity of the gas .",
    "firstly , in the gas dominated phase of the cluster , tides limit the accretion as the relative velocity between the stars and gas is low . the tidal radius , due to the star s position in cluster potential , @xmath6 is then smaller than the traditional bondi - hoyle radius and determines the accretion rate .",
    "accretion in this regime naturally results in a mass segregated cluster as the accretion rates are highest in the cluster core .    once accretion has increased the mass of the stars , and consequently decreased the gas mass present , the stars begin to dominate the stellar potential and thus virialise .",
    "this occurs first in the core of the cluster where higher - mass stars form due to the higher accretion rates there.the relative velocity between the gas and stars is then large and thus the bondi - hoyle radius , @xmath7 becomes smaller than the tidal radius and determines the accretion rates .",
    "we can use the above formulation of the accretion rates , with a simple model for the stellar cluster in the two physical regimes , in order to derive the resultant mass functions ( bonnell  2001b ) .",
    "the primary difference is the power of the stellar mass in the accretion rate equation , @xmath8 for tidal - accretion and @xmath9 for bondi - hoyle accretion . starting from a gas rich cluster with equal stellar masses , tidal accretion results in higher accretion rates in the centre of the cluster where the gas density is highest .",
    "this results in a spread of stellar mass and a mass segregated cluster .",
    "the lower dependency of the accretion rate on the stellar mass results in a fairly shallow imf of the form ( where salpeter is @xmath10 ) @xmath11 once the cluster core enters the stellar dominated regime where bondi - hoyle accretion occurs , the higher dependency of the accretion rate on the stellar mass results in a steeper mass spectrum .",
    "zinnecker ( 1982 ) first showed how a bondi - hoyle type accretion results in a @xmath12 imf . in a more developed model of accretion into the core of a cluster with a pre - existing mass segregation ,",
    "the resultant imf is of the form @xmath13 this steeper imf applies only to those stars that accrete the bulk of their mass in the stellar dominated regime , ie .",
    "the high - mass stars in the core of the cluster ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "in order to asses the role of accretion in determining the imf , we need to consider self - consistent models for the formation of the cluster .",
    "we followed the fragmentation of a 1000  cloud with a @xmath14 pc radius ( bonnell , bate & vine  2003 ) .",
    "the cloud is initially supported by turbulence which decays on the cloud s crossing time .",
    "as the turbulence decays , it generates filamentary structure which act as the seeds for the subsequent fragmentation .",
    "the cluster forms in a hierarchical manner with many subclusters forming before eventually merging into one larger cluster . in all 419 stars",
    "form in @xmath15 years .",
    "the simulation produces a field star imf with a shallow slope for low - mass stars steepening to a salpeter - like slope for high - mass stars ( figure  2 ) .",
    "the stars all form with low masses and accrete up to their final masses .",
    "the stars that are in the centres of the subclusters accrete more gas and thus become higher - mass stars .",
    "a careful dissection of the origin of the more massive stars reveals the importance of competitive accretion in setting the imf .",
    "the lagrangian nature of the sph simulations allows us to trace the mass from which a star forms .",
    "we can therefore distribute this mass as being in one of three categories : 1 ) the original fragment which formed the star ; 2 ) a contiguous envelope around the fragment until we reach the next forming star ; and 3 ) mass which originates beyond the forming group or cluster of stars .",
    "figure  3 shows the three contributions to the final stellar mass of the 419 stars ( bonnell , vine & bate  2004 ) .",
    "we see that the initial fragment mass is generally around @xmath16 and fails to account for both high - mass and low - mass stars .",
    "the contiguous envelope does a better job as it accounts for subfragmention into lower - mass stars .",
    "it still fails to explain the mass of higher - mass stars .",
    "we are thus left with accretion from beyond the forming protocluster in order to explain the existence of higher - mass stars .",
    "thus , high - mass stars are formed due to competive accretion of gas that _",
    "infalls _ into the stellar cluster .",
    "one of the predictions that we can extract from the simulations is that there should be a strong correlation between the mass of the most massive star and the number of stars in the cluster ( figure  4 , bonnell , vine & bate  2004 ) .",
    "this occurs due to the simultaneous accretion of stars and gas into a forming stellar cluster .",
    "given an effective initial efficiency of fragmentation , for every star that falls into the cluster a certain amount of gas also enters the cluster .",
    "this gas joins the common reservoir from which the most massive star takes the largest share in this competitive environment .",
    "thus , the mass of the most massive star increases as the cluster grows in numbers of stars .",
    "if competitive accretion is the determining factor in setting the imf , what role does the jeans mass play ?",
    "we saw above that the average fragment mass in which stars form is @xmath17  while the initial jeans mass is @xmath18 .",
    "thie jeans mass is therefore important at setting the scale of the initial fragmentation .",
    "we have run a simulation identical to the one in bonnell , bate & vine  ( 2003 ) except with a jeans mass of @xmath19 .",
    "the resultant imf , shown in figure  5 , is fairly shallow up to masses of @xmath20 , corresponding roughly to the jeans mass . in figure  2",
    "we see that the slope of the imf becomes steeper at @xmath21 , the jeans mass in this simulation .",
    "we can thus deduce that the jeans mass helps set the _ knee _ in the imf , with lower masses determined by fragmentation and the tidal shearing of nearby stars , while higher - masses are determined by accretion in a clustered environment .",
    "competiitve accretion is a simple physical model that can explain the origin of the initial mass function .",
    "it relies on gravitational competition for gas in a clustered environment and does not necessarily involve large - scale motions of the accretors .",
    "the two physical regimes ( gas and stellar dominated potentials ) naturally result in a two power - law imf .",
    "it is probably even more important for any model of the imf to have secondary characteristics that can be compared to observations .",
    "for example , competive accretion naturally results in a mass segregated cluster , and predicts that massive star formation is intrinsically linked to the formation of a stellar cluster .",
    "some of the simulations reported here were performed with the uk s astrophysical fluid facility , ukaff ."
