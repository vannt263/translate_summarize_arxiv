    "neutron rich nuclei have become a very popular object of experimental and theoretical nuclear structure studies . besides the crucial role these nuclei play in nuclear astrophysics and their importance for constraining the nuclear energy density functional , these nuclei exhibit fascinating properties which are qualitatively different from ordinary nuclei .",
    "for instance , as a consequence of the `` neutron skin '' surrounding the core of medium - mass and heavy neutron - rich nuclei , there are new kinds of collective motion which are absent in nuclei without strong neutron excess ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "a famous example for such a collective mode is the so - called pygmy resonance .",
    "contrary to the well - known isovector giant - dipole resonance ( gdr ) , where neutrons and protons move against each other , the pygmy - dipole resonance ( pdr ) consists , roughly speaking , of an oscillation of the neutron skin against the @xmath0 core .",
    "this mode is not only interesting in itself , but its existence has also a strong effect on the abundances of the elements in the universe @xcite . after first studies within schematic hydrodynamic models @xcite , the pygmy mode was investigated within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , using non - relativistic @xcite or relativistic formalisms @xcite , and beyond , using the quasiparticle - phonon model @xcite .    another exotic type of collective motion is the `` toroidal dipole mode '' .",
    "this isoscalar mode , which is characterized by a velocity field of toroidal shape , was predicted many years ago @xcite .",
    "since the restoring force for this kind of motion is generated by the distortion of the fermi surface , this mode can not be described within hydrodynamic models .",
    "studies of this mode were carried out within the method of wigner function moments @xcite , within nuclear fluid dynamics @xcite , and within the relativistic rpa @xcite . since the toroidal dipole mode is isoscalar and exists also in @xmath0 nuclei ,",
    "it was usually not connected with the pygmy resonance , although different calculations @xcite showed that the velocity field of the pygmy mode has a toroidal shape .    in the past",
    ", semiclassical approaches such as the steinwedel - jensen model @xcite contributed a lot to the understanding of giant resonances and how they can be related to global properties of nuclei .",
    "since semiclassical approaches average over shell effects @xcite , they lead to clear and intuitive pictures which , contrary to the results of quantum mechanical rpa calculations , are not obscured by details of the specific single - particle energies and wave functions of the nuclei under consideration .",
    "this is why new modes of excitation , such as the torus mode mentioned before , were often first identified in semiclassical approaches .    in the case of the pygmy mode",
    ", a generally accepted picture is still missing .",
    "it is not even clear whether the pygmy mode is a generic collective mode like the giant resonances , or whether it depends on a particular structure of the single - particle levels .",
    "the aim of the present paper is therefore to study this mode by solving the semiclassical vlasov equation for the case of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "the vlasov equation has been shown to give a reasonable description of generic properties of different collective modes of nuclei @xcite .",
    "as we will see , the main result of the present study is that the pygmy mode is closely related to a low - lying isoscalar torus mode , which is clearly collective and whose existence is not limited to nuclei with neutron excess .    in this paper , we are looking for a numerical solution of the full vlasov equation without any additional simplifying assumptions , as opposed to , e.g. , fluid - dynamical approaches .",
    "a solution of the vlasov equation for collective modes was given in refs .",
    "@xcite , but the calculations were restricted to woods - saxon potentials with separable residual interactions .",
    "this is not sufficient for the description of modes which possibly depend on exotic ground state properties such as the neutron skin . in the present work ,",
    "the starting point is the ground state in thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation , calculated self - consistently with the same interaction that is also used in the vlasov dynamics .",
    "the importance of a consistent description of the ground state and of the dynamics within a transport model was recently pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the monopole mode .    for the calculation of the mean field",
    "entering both the tf and the vlasov calculations , an effective interaction capable of describing exotic nuclei is needed . in the present work , a simplified version of the so - called bcp functional @xcite will be used , which is an energy functional whose bulk part is based on a fit to microscopic brckner calculations , reproducing the equation of state of nuclear matter in a range of asymmetries from symmetric matter to pure neutron matter and in a range of densities from zero to more than saturation density .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that the general findings presented here depend on the details of the interaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , the method is explained . in sec .",
    "[ sec : pygmy ] , results for the electric dipole response are presented . besides the strength function , the transition densities and velocity fields of the gdr and the pdr are discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : torus ] , results for the response to the isoscalar toroidal dipole operator are shown . in particular , by comparing the transition densities and velocity fields with those discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : pygmy ] , we see that in neutron - rich nuclei , the pdr and the gdr are modes which are excited by both the electric dipole and the isoscalar toroidal dipole operators due to the mixing of isoscalar and isovector modes . sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] is devoted to the summary and conclusions .",
    "like other collective vibrations , the pygmy resonance has been studied within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) @xcite , which can be interpreted as the small - amplitude limit of the time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) theory @xcite .",
    "written in terms of the one - body density matrix @xmath1 and the mean - field hamiltonian @xmath2 , the tdhf equation reads and @xmath3 , different mean - field hamiltonians @xmath4 and @xmath5 , etc . in order to improve the readability , isospin indices",

    ", we will employ the test - particle method which has often been used for the description of heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of this method is to replace the distribution function @xmath9 by a finite number of delta functions ( `` test particles '' ) @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the number of test particles per nucleon and @xmath17 is the mass number of the nucleus . in order to satisfy the pauli principle , the density of test particles of each species ( @xmath18 ) in phase - space must not exceed @xmath19 ( the factor of 2 is the spin degeneracy ) .",

    "( [ vlasov ] ) , one finds that each test particle has to follow its classical trajectory given by @xmath20 in the case of a purely local mean field , the equations of motion reduce to @xmath21 it is clear that these equations of motion prevent the test particles from entering the classically fobidden region .",
    "note that this absence of tunneling is inherent to the vlasov equation and independent of the numerical method .",
    "the density @xmath22 corresponding to the distribution function ( [ ftestparticle ] ) is a sum of delta functions and hence not suitable for any practical calculation . in order to obtain a well - defined density which can be used , e.g. , for the calculation of the mean field @xmath11 , it is common to replace the delta functions in eq .",
    "( [ ftestparticle ] ) by gaussians @xcite , leading to a smooth density @xmath23    for the sake of consistency , if one uses the smooth density @xmath24 in the calculation of the mean field @xmath25 , one has to modify also the acceleration equation and replace the force at @xmath26 by a force averaged over the gaussian @xcite , @xmath27 where @xmath28    contrary to quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite and related approaches , where similar gaussians ( in @xmath29 and @xmath30 space ) are used to simulate quantum effects , we wish to stay here in the semiclassical framework and therefore do not attach any profound meaning to the smoothed density @xmath31 .",
    "we consider it as an auxiliary quantity one has to introduce in the test - particle approach in order to be able to calculate well - defined densities and mean fields . as we will see in the next subsection ,",

    "@xcite in order to get the right surface energy , has mainly the effect to smooth out the mean fields as compared to the densities .",
    "the same effect can be achieved without any additional term @xmath40 if one introduces a finite range into the bulk term @xmath39 .",
    "for instance , in the latest version of the bcp functional @xcite , @xmath40 has been substituted by a finite range in the quadratic term of @xmath39 .    here ,",
    "instead of implementing directly a finite - range force between the test particles , we first calculate the smooth density by folding the distribution function with a gaussian of width @xmath43 [ eq .",

    "the situation is opposite if the excitation operator is time - odd , i.e. , @xmath113 : in this case , the velocity is zero at @xmath97 , while the density is immediately changed due to the displacement of the particles in coordinate space .    in order to find the contribution of a given mode to the density and velocity oscillations ,",
    "one has to choose the energy @xmath114 corresponding to a peak in the strength function and compute the transition densities and velocity fields as a fourier transform of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , respectively . in the case of a time - even excitation operator , one has to use @xmath117 whereas in the case of a time - odd operator , the sine and cosine functions must be interchanged . in practice , since the simulation runs only to @xmath118 @xmath70 , the sine and cosine functions are multiplied by an exponential damping factor @xmath119 , @xmath108 mev , as in the strength function @xmath104 .",
    "it should be noted that even if the energy @xmath114 corresponds to a peak in @xmath104 , the transition densities and velocity fields obtained with this method may still contain contributions from other modes if those have a width which makes their spectrum extend to energy @xmath114 .",

    "for instance , the curve shown for @xmath127sn is very well fitted by a lorentzian with energy 15.8 mev and width 2.4 mev ( which includes the artificial width @xmath108 mev mentioned in the end of sec .",
    "[ subsec : responsefunction ] ) , whereas the corresponding experimental energy and width are 15.67 and 4.19 mev , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is in fact not surprising that the widths are too small . since in the linear regime",
    "the vlasov equation is a semiclassical version of the rpa @xcite , the only damping mechanism that is present here is landau damping .",
    "the fact that in an anharmonic potential different classical orbits have different periodicities leads to effects which are completely analogous to the splitting of the quantum mechanical single - particle levels , as already noticed in refs .",

    "one can see a small amount of dipole strength below the gdr which is absent in the @xmath0 nucleus @xmath126sn and which becomes a well defined peak at 8.6 mev in the case of @xmath62sn .",
    "this peak corresponds to the pdr . for comparison , in experiment ,",
    "it was seen in @xmath129sn and @xmath62sn at a slightly higher energy of approximately 9.8 mev @xcite . subtracting the tail of the gdr ( assuming that it has the same shape as in @xmath126sn )",
    ", one finds that in @xmath62sn the pdr contributes about 4% to the energy - weighted sum rule ( ewsr ) , which happens to be in perfect agreement with the experimental value from ref .",
    "however , the experimental number for @xmath129sn is larger ( @xmath130 of the ewsr ) than that for @xmath62sn although the neutron excess is smaller , certainly due to the doubly magic nature of @xmath62sn .",
    "in a theory without shell effects , the results for @xmath129sn and @xmath62sn are of course almost identical .",
    "nevertheless this comparison shows that , in spite of its crudeness , the semiclassical approach is capable of giving the right order of magnitude for the transition strength .    in order to see how sensitive these results are to the choice of the width parameter @xmath43 ,",
    "the calculation for @xmath62sn was repeated with @xmath131 instead of 0.7 fm .",
    "the main effect of this change on the electric dipole response is that the gdr is slightly shifted from 14.5 to 15.3 mev .",
    "the position of the pdr is almost not affected ( the maximum of the peak is shifted from 8.6 to 8.7 mev ) .",
    "the height of the peak corresponding to the pdr is slightly reduced , but subtracting the tail of the gdr , which is now further apart , one finds again that it contributes about 4% of the ewsr .",
    "the shape of the transition densities and velocity fields ( see next subsection ) of the two modes are not changed either , except that they go to zero more rapidly at the surface .",
    "the conclusion is that the results do not depend strongly on the parameter @xmath43 , and from now on we will keep @xmath46 fm which is the value motivated in sec . [",

    "the graphical representation of the transition density can be simplified by assuming that the amplitude of the oscillation is weak ( linear response regime ) . in this case , the spherical symmetry of the ground state and the dipole form of the excitation operator imply that the transition density can be written as @xmath138 , where @xmath139 and @xmath140 .    in order to test the calculation of transition densities and velocity fields ,",
    "let us start with a simple example , namely with the gdr in the symmetric nucleus @xmath126sn .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] .",
    "+    as expected , protons and neutrons move against each other in @xmath141 direction . the velocity ( fig .",
    "[ figure5]b ) is not constant but decreases with increasing @xmath142 and gets curved , almost as in the steinwedel - jensen model in which the radial component of the velocity field vanishes at the surface @xcite . since the coulomb interaction",
    "is not included in the present calculation , the transition densities and velocity fields of neutrons and protons should be exactly opposite to each other .",
    "for the velocity fields ( fig .",
    "[ figure5]b ) , this seems to be the case , but in the transition densities ( fig .",
    "[ figure5]a ) a discrepancy is present at small radii ( @xmath143 fm ) .",
    "this is clearly a numerical error .",
    "the reason is that at small radii , the angle averaging , which is implicit in the computation of the radial functions @xmath144 , is less effective in reducing statistical fluctuations than at large radii .",
    "since the amplitude of the oscillation is very small , already small statistical fluctuations of the density can lead to an erroneous result for the transition density .",
    "this is why the transition densities at @xmath145 fm can not be trusted .",
    "after this word of caution , let us look at the more interesting case of the neutron rich nucleus @xmath62sn .",
    "since in this nucleus the neutron and proton density distributions in the ground state are different , one does not expect any more that the transition densities and velocity fields of neutrons and protons are exactly opposite to each other .",
    "generally speaking , in @xmath146 nuclei , even in the absence of coulomb interaction , the collective modes are not exactly isovector or isoscalar ones , but they have both isovector and isoscalar components .",
    "let us first discuss the gdr which is displayed in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] .",
    "+    since the transition densities for @xmath147 fm are not reliable , the node of @xmath148 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ figure6]a ) is most likely a numerical error . beyond that radius ,",
    "the shape of the transition densities is typical for the gdr . as a consequence of the neutron skin",
    ", the transition density of neutrons extends to larger radii than that of protons .",
    "the velocity fields ( fig .",
    "[ figure6]b ) are more surprising : while the proton velocity is very similar to the one in @xmath126sn , the neutron velocity is very different .",
    "it seems that in @xmath62sn the neutron velocity is strongly suppressed in the center and enhanced in the neutron skin .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon is not completely understood , but a possible explanation could be the coupling between the isovector gdr and the isoscalar torus mode , see next section .    in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] ,     +    the transition densities and velocity fields corresponding to the pygmy mode are displayed .",
    "as one can see , protons and neutrons oscillate mainly in phase .",
    "the isovector component of the pygmy mode comes from the different transition densities in the region of the neutron skin .",
    "the velocity field has a toroidal shape , very different from the giant resonance .",
    "such a shape was already found in quantum mechanical calculations of the velocity field of the pygmy mode in @xmath149zr @xcite and in @xmath124pb @xcite . in the literature",
    ", it is often said that the pdr is an oscillation of the neutron skin against the @xmath0 core of the nucleus @xcite . due to the toroidal form of the velocity field ,",
    "the neutrons in the neutron skin indeed move against the neutrons in the core .",
    "however , the image of the skin oscillating as a whole against an inert core seems to be over - simplified , since the protons have a toroidal flow - pattern , too .",
    "motivated by the toroidal shape of the velocity field of the pdr , let us have a closer look at the isoscalar torus mode .",
    "its excitation operator is given by @xmath150 here , the term @xmath151 has been added to the operator given in ref .",
    "@xcite in order to make sure that the excitation does not displace the center of mass of the nucleus .",
    "note that , according to eq .",
    "( [ kick ] ) , this excitation operator leads to a change of both positions and momenta of the test particles at @xmath97 since it depends on @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the corresponding strength functions of @xmath126sn and @xmath62sn are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] .",
    "we see that the strength is split into two regions below and above @xmath152 mev .",
    "the first region contains two peaks at @xmath153 and @xmath154 mev in the case of @xmath126sn and three peaks at @xmath155 , @xmath156 , and @xmath157 mev in the case of @xmath62sn . in the second region",
    ", there is an isolated peak at @xmath158 mev in the case of @xmath126sn and @xmath159 mev in the case of @xmath62sn .",
    "the nature of the different modes will be clarified by the analysis of the corresponding transition densities and velocity fields .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the positions of the modes in @xmath126sn at @xmath153 and @xmath158 mev are in good agreement with recent rpa results obtained with the ucom interaction @xcite .",
    "the mode at @xmath154 mev corresponds probably to the fragmented strength concentrated around @xmath160 mev in the rpa response , see fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite .      in figs .",
    "[ figure9]-[figure12 ] the transition densities and velocity fields corresponding to the peaks of the toroidal dipole response of @xmath62sn at @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath159 mev are shown .",
    "+     +     +     +    let us first compare the results for the modes at @xmath155 ( fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] ) and @xmath156 mev ( fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] ) . at first glance ,",
    "the velocity fields look similar for these two modes , but the transition densities are completely different . both modes are essentially isoscalar . comparing the results for the @xmath155 mev mode in fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] with the results for the pdr at @xmath161 mev in fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] , we see a striking similarity .",
    "one can say that these two modes are in fact one and the same , only excited in two different ways .",
    "note that the lines with zero velocity , around which the protons and neutrons circulate , are at @xmath162 fm and @xmath163 fm from the center of the nucleus , respectively , i.e. , they lie inside the core of the nucleus and not in the surface .",
    "the velocity field of the mode at @xmath156 mev looks even more like a torus , since the shape of the velocity field is more rounded than in the mode at @xmath155 mev .",
    "what about the third mode at @xmath157 mev ( fig .",
    "[ figure11 ] ) ?",
    "first of all , from the transition densities , one sees that this mode has mainly isovector character . comparing with the results for the gdr at @xmath164 mev in fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] , one concludes that the mode at 14.6 mev is in fact the gdr , which is excited by the isoscalar toroidal dipole operator due to the strong neutron excess in @xmath62sn . finally , the high - lying isoscalar dipole mode at @xmath159 mev ( fig .",
    "[ figure12 ] ) has a completely different nature .",
    "as can be seen from the velocity field , this mainly isoscalar mode exhibits a compressional motion , and for this reason it is usually called the compressional dipole mode .    in order to get a better understanding of the two low - lying modes at @xmath155 and @xmath156 mev , let us look at the corresponding modes of @xmath126sn which lie at @xmath153 and @xmath154 mev , see figs .",
    "[ figure13 ] and [ figure14 ] .",
    "+     +    we observe that the mode at @xmath153 mev in @xmath126sn ( fig .",
    "[ figure13 ] ) has qualitatively the same velocity field and transition density as the mode corresponding to the pdr in @xmath62sn ( fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] ) . from this one may conclude that the existence of this mode does not require the presence of a neutron skin .",
    "the neutron excess is only needed in order to be able to probe this mode with the electric dipole operator .",
    "looking closely at the velocity field of this mode ( figs .",
    "[ figure9 ] and [ figure13 ] ) , one realizes that the velocity field is almost constant in the center of the nucleus , contrary to the velocity field of the toroidal mode which lies at slightly higher energy [ @xmath156 mev in @xmath62sn ( fig .",
    "[ figure10 ] ) and @xmath154 mev in @xmath126sn ( fig .",
    "[ figure14 ] ) , respectively ] .",
    "this can be interpreted in the sense hat the lower one of the two modes is an oscillation of the surface ( not necessarily the neutron skin , since @xmath126sn does not have one ) against the core , whereas the higher one is the original torus mode which , in the framework of nuclear fluid dynamics , exists already in a uniform sphere .",
    "this interpretation is corroborated by the transition densities , which in the case of the higher mode ( figs .",
    "[ figure10 ] and [ figure14 ] ) are much more concentrated in the inner part of the nucleus , while those of the lower mode ( figs . [ figure9 ] and [ figure13 ] ) are much stronger in the surface region .",
    "another support for this interpretation is the energy of this mode : according to ref .",
    "@xcite , in a uniform sphere and within nuclear fluid dynamics , the torus mode should lie at @xmath165 mev , i.e. , at @xmath166 mev in the case of @xmath126sn and @xmath167 mev in the case of @xmath62sn .",
    "this is slightly higher , but not very far from the modes found here at @xmath154 and @xmath156 mev , respectively .",
    "in this paper , electric and isoscalar dipole excitations were studied within the semiclassical tf plus vlasov approach . as interaction ,",
    "the bulk part of the bcp functional was employed , which was smoothed out in space in order to mimic the effect of the neglected finite - range term .",
    "the tf equation for the ground state as well as the vlasov equation for the dynamics were solved numerically without any further simplifying assumptions . compared to fully quantum mechanical hartree - fock plus rpa calculations",
    ", the present method is missing the shell effects , what can be useful if one is interested in generic properties and average trends .",
    "the electric dipole response of oxygen and tin isotopes was discussed ( calculations for other nuclei like calcium and lead were performed but not shown ) . in all cases ,",
    "low - lying strength corresponding to the pdr was found in the very neutron - rich isotopes , however in the neutron - rich oxygen isotopes the strength was spread over a large energy range , in accordance with the strong fragmentation of the strength in quantum mechanical calculations @xcite , so that one can not speak of a collective mode in this case .",
    "this shows that the existence of the pdr is a generic property of neutron - rich nuclei and does not rely on a specific structure of single - particle levels . in heavier nuclei ,",
    "the pdr is found to be a collective excitation .",
    "the obtained energies and transition probabilities are roughly in agreement with experimental data ( at least as well as it can be expected in a theory without shell effects ) . the transition densities and velocity fields of the pygmy mode",
    "were analysed and it was found that the velocity field has a toroidal shape , in agreement with the findings of earlier quantum mechanical calculations @xcite .",
    "the vortex line lies inside the core of the nucleus , and the torus can therefore be seen in both neutron and proton velocity fields , which suggests that the popular picture of the neutron skin oscillating against a static @xmath0 core is oversimplified .    in order to compare the pdr and the torus mode in detail , the response to the isoscalar toroidal operator",
    "was studied . in the example of @xmath62sn",
    "it was found that , due to the mixing of isoscalar and isovector modes , the predominantly isoscalar pdr and the predominantly isovector gdr can be seen in both the e1 and the toroidal strength functions .",
    "in addition , the toroidal response exhibits two peaks which do not show up in the electric dipole response : a second toroidal mode which lies slightly above the pdr , and a compressional dipole mode .",
    "the two toroidal modes exist also in the @xmath0 nucleus @xmath126sn .",
    "hence , the existence of these modes , including the lower one which in the case of @xmath62sn was identified with the pdr , does not rely on the presence of a neutron skin .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , the reason why the pdr is only seen in nuclei with large neutron excess is simply that otherwise the e1 strength of this mode is too small to be seen .",
    "however , it was recently pointed out that , if the isospin symmetry breaking effect of the coulomb interaction is taken into account , a small contribution of this mode can be seen even in the electric dipole response of @xmath0 nuclei @xcite ) .",
    "another conclusion which can be drawn from this result is that the pdr , like the torus mode , can not be described in a hydrodynamical picture , but its existence relies on the `` elasticity '' of the nuclear medium due to fermi - surface deformation .",
    "this fact was also stressed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the two toroidal modes are apparently qualitatively different , although their velocity fields look quite similar : the higher mode corresponds to the torus mode of an elastic sphere , which has been discussed in the literature for many years @xcite , whereas the lower one corresponds more to an oscillation of the core against the surface ( but not necessarily against the neutron skin ) , qualitatively similar to the modes discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "of course , the present approach has some shortcomings and is not meant to replace more sophisticated quantum - mechanical calculations . since it is a semiclassical formalism , shell effects can not be described . on the one hand , this results in clear pictures for the different modes , but on the other hand , it is of course a simplification which makes the detailed comparison with experiment and with more realistic calculations difficult .",
    "in addition , a couple of approximations were made which give probably rise to systematic deviations .",
    "for example , the coulomb interaction was omitted .",
    "one would also expect an important effect from pairing , since it affects in particular rotational motion and excitations involving fermi surface deformation .",
    "nevertheless , the obtained results are surprisingly reasonable and will maybe serve as a motivation for a more detailed study of the relationship between the pygmy and the torus mode within fully quantum mechanical approaches .",

    "this work was supported by anr ( project nexen ) .",
    "all simulations were done in three dimensions without any imposed symmetries . however , for the graphical representation of the results it is advantageous to average the densities and velocity fields over the angle in order to reduce the statistical noise due to the finite number of test particles .",
