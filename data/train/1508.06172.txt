    "as the electron - phonon matrix elements related to the frhlich interaction are not localized in the wannier basis , these matrix elements can not be properly interpolated with the method of refs .  .",
    "in this work , we extend the method  @xcite to take into account polar - optical coupling , and apply it to gaas which is an archetype of a polar semiconductor .",
