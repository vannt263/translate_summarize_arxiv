    "the complete characterization of microwave emission from spinning dust grains is a key question in both astrophysics and cosmology as it probes a region of the electromagnetic spectrum where a number of different astrophysical disciplines overlap : it is important for cmb observations in order to correctly characterise the contaminating foreground emission ( gold et  al .",
    "2010 ) ; for star and planetary formation it is important because it potentially probes a regime of grain sizes that is not otherwise easily observable ( rafikov 2000 ) .",
    "although a number of objects have now been found to exhibit anomalous microwave emission , attributed to spinning dust , it is still unclear what differentiates those objects from the many other seemingly similar targets that do not show the excess . in order to investigate this question a number of galactic observations",
    "have been made towards known star formation regions ( see e.g. ami consortium : scaife et  al . 2010 and references therein ; casassus et  al .",
    "2008 ; tibbs et  al .",
    "in addition murphy et  al .",
    "( 2010 ; hereinafter m10 ) made the first extra - galactic search for anomalous microwave emission within the star formation regions of the nearby galaxy ngc  6946 using the caltech continuum back - end on the green bank telescope .",
    "m10 found a significantly anomalous spectrum in only one of 10 star - forming regions : extra - nuclear region 4 ( hereinafter ngc  6946-e4 ) .",
    "the excess of emission was seen between 2738ghz relative to the continuum emission at 8.5ghz measured using combined effelsberg 100 m telescope and vla observations ( beck 2007 ) .    in this letter",
    "we present follow - up observations of ngc  6946-e4 at frequencies from 15 - 18ghz using the arcminute microkelvin imager ( ami ) large array ( la ) . in section  [ sec : obs ]",
    "we present the details of these observations , in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results of the ami - la observations and a comparison with other radio data , and in section  [ sec : conc ] we discuss the implications of these results and form our conclusions . in what follows we use the convention : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is flux density , @xmath2 is frequency and @xmath3 is the spectral index .",
    "all errors are quoted to 1@xmath4 .",
    "the ami - la consists of eight 13 m antennas and is sited at lord s bridge , cambridge ( ami consortium : zwart et  al .",
    "the telescope observes in the band 13.918.2ghz with cryogenically cooled nrao indium - phosphide front - end amplifiers .",
    "the overall system temperature is approximately 25k .",
    "amplification , equalization , path compensation and automatic gain control are applied to the if signal .",
    "the back - end has an analogue lag correlator with 16 independent correlations formed at double the nyquist rate for each baseline using path delays spaced by 26 mm . from these ,",
    "eight complex visibilities are formed in 0.75ghz bandwidth channels . in",
    "what follows , the three lowest frequency channels ( 1 , 2 & 3 ; 13.914.6ghz ) are not used due to interference from geostationary satellites .",
    "ngc  6946-e4 ( j@xmath5 ) was observed by the ami - la in a single 12 hour synthesis .",
    "data reduction was performed using the local software tool reduce .",
    "this applies both automatic and manual flags for interference , shadowing and hardware errors , phase and amplitude calibrations and then fourier transforms the correlator data to synthesize frequency channels before output to disk in _ uv _ fits format suitable for imaging in aips .",
    "flux calibration was performed using short observations of 3c48 at the beginning of the run and 3c286 at the end of the run .",
    "we assumed i+q flux densities for these sources in the ami - la channels consistent with the frequency dependent model of baars et al .",
    "( 1977 ) , @xmath6 1.64 and 3.48jy , respectively , at 15ghz . as baars et  al",
    ". measure i and ami - la measures i+q , these flux densities include corrections for the polarisation of the calibrator sources derived by interpolating from vla 5 , 8 and 22ghz observations .",
    "a correction is also made for the changing intervening airmass over the observation . from cross - calibration of 3c48 and 3c286",
    ", we find the flux calibration is accurate to better than 5 per cent .",
    "the phase was calibrated using interleaved observations of j2031 + 5455 , selected from the jodrell bank vla survey ( jvas ; patnaik et  al .",
    "1992 ) . after calibration",
    ", the phase is generally stable to @xmath7 for channels 47 , and @xmath8 for channel 8 .",
    "the fwhm of the primary beam of the ami - la is @xmath9at 16ghz .",
    "reduced data were imaged using the aips data package .",
    "deconvolution was performed using the task .",
    "deconvolution maps were made from both the combined channel set and for individual channels .",
    "( a)(b )      the combined channel map from the ami - la observation of ngc  6946-e4 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : amimap ] .",
    "e4 is located at the phase centre with extra - nuclear region 8 ( j@xmath10 ; ngc  6946-e8 ) to the east and the galactic nucleus of ngc  6946 ( j@xmath11 ) further to the east , outside the primary beam fwhm .",
    "flux densities were extracted for both ngc  6946-e4 and ngc  6946-e8 . since ngc  6946-e8 also lies within the fwhm of the primary beam we used the recovered flux densities for this source as a check on the absolute calibration for this field .",
    "the flux densities measured for ngc  6946-e4 and ngc  6946-e8 are listed in table  [ tab : fluxes ] .      [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "considered on their own , the ami - la data ( after correction for flux loss ) have a spectral index of @xmath12 .",
    "although this value is consistent with optically thin free  free emission , the error on this estimate is large and we can not rule out other mechanisms . since the spectral index between the effelsberg - vla measurement at 8.5ghz and the ami band is rising ( @xmath13 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : e4spec ] ) , we need to consider the possibility that region e4 contains one or more compact hii regions with their opacity reaching unity at approximately 12ghz .",
    "such an opacity would require an emission measure of @xmath14pc@xmath15 , assuming @xmath16k , and would be appropriate for a compact hii region .",
    "we therefore examine two alternative hypotheses for the emission from region e4 .",
    "the first is that the emission is due to the usual diffuse synchrotron and free  free mechanisms associated with star - formation , with an additional high - opacity free ",
    "free component ( hypothesis 1 ; h1 ) .",
    "the second hypothesis is that there is a spinning dust component rather than high - opacity free  free ( h2 ) .",
    "a summary of how well these two hypotheses fit the observed data is shown in the form of fan - diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : e4spec ] . as can be seen from this figure , neither of the hypotheses can be ruled out , although the spinning - dust appears to somewhat better match the data .",
    "this is also confirmed by a simple comparison of the models : assuming flat priors and no a priori difference between the models , the logarithmic bayes factor is @xmath17 in favour of the spinning dust model . from the jeffreys scale of evidence ( jeffreys 1961",
    "; kass & raftery 1995 ; see e.g. efron & gous 2001 for further discussion of this scale ) this would indicate a weak positive preference for the spinning dust model above the free  free model .",
    "the maximum likelihood parameters for these models are listed in table  [ tab : parms ] .    for comparison we have also carried out a similar analysis on the region e8 , shown in fig  [ fig : e8specfan ] . in this case",
    "the two hypotheses are a simple diffuse synchrotron plus free  free model ( h1 ) versus the same model with an additional spinning dust component ( h2 ) . in this case",
    "the logarithm of the bayesian evidence ratio is @xmath18 in favour of the simpler model without the spinning dust",
    ". a ratio of this size indicates no perceptible difference between the two models .    in region e4 where a spinning dust model is the preferred hypothesis , we can marginalise the posterior distribution of the model parameters to obtain an estimate of the gas mass containing the spinning dust , shown as a histogram in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : sdmass - margin ] and in numerical form in table  [ tab : parms ] , i.e. , @xmath19 . in region",
    "e8 spinning dust is not the preferred hypothesis but proceeding with this hypothesis anyway , we find an upper limit for the mass of the gas bearing the spinning dust , which is around @xmath20 .",
    "we draw a conclusion that if the conditions in e4 and e8 are similar , then the mass of any gas bearing spinning dust in e8 must be at least a factor of five smaller than in e4 .",
    "region e4 is located on the dense rim of a `` remarkable '' hi hole ( boomsma et  al .",
    "2008 ) within ngc  6946 .",
    "such an association may be relevent to the differentiation of this star formation region from the eight others found to exhibit no anomalous emission by m10 .",
    "the hole is remarkable for a number of reasons , notably the almost unbroken symmetry of its dense hi rim , unusual in so large a hole , and the small scale high velocity gas complexes observed in connection with it .",
    "as mentioned above , the spinning dust model is preferred by the evidence calculation for ngc  6946-e4 , but not at a very high level .",
    "definitive confirmation of the nature of the emission requires measurements at frequencies above 50ghz where the spinning dust and compact h ii region models have significantly different behaviour .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : e4spec ] shows that at 100ghz the difference between these two models should be at least a factor of two in brightness .",
    "in the sub - mm there are data available from scuba at 850@xmath21 m for this region by @xcite , which might be used to constrain the mass of ngc  6946-e4 and place constraints on the frequency at which the optical depth reaches unity .",
    "if a compact hii region is present , with @xmath22 at @xmath23ghz it should have a correspondingly high dust mass . from analysis of the scuba data we obtained a flux estimate for region e4 of @xmath24mjybeam@xmath25 .",
    "however , the errors on this estimate are too high to allow any useful constraint on the properties of the thermal dust emission or to calculate a reliable dust mass estimate .    from the existing data the possibility of a spinning dust component in this region can not be ruled out , but the evidence is not yet definitive .",
    "further observations of this object at frequencies covering the higher frequency minimum between spinning dust emission and thermal dust emission ( @xmath26ghz ) would be most useful .",
    "we thank the staff of the lord s bridge observatory for their invaluable assistance in the commissioning and operation of the arcminute microkelvin imager .",
    "the ami - la is supported by cambridge university and the stfc . as thanks thijs van der hulst for drawing attention to the hi complexes in ngc  6946 .",
