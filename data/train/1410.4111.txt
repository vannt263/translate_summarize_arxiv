    "over the past ten years , numerous simulations have reported the influence of the cosmic web on the direction of the angular momentum ( am ) of halos .",

    "this was confirmed with high degree of accuracy by , which quantified a redshift - dependent mass transition @xmath0 separating aligned and perpendicular halos .",
    "they interpreted the origin of the transition in terms of large - scale cosmic flows : high - mass haloes would have spins perpendicular to the filament because they are the results of major mergers while low - mass haloes acquire their mass by smooth accretion from the vorticity quadrant they are embedded in , resulting in spins parallel to the filament ( see also ) ) .    in order to make predictions for observational estimators of such correlations ,",

    "we find clear indication that smooth accretion flattens galaxies along this axis over cosmic time .",
    "all findings sustain the above detailed scenario . while it is easy to understand why the aligned component of the spin might not persist when galaxies grow larger than their embedding vorticity quadrant",

    "galaxies merge preferentially along filaments .",
    "a pair of galaxies about to merge  which are catching up relative to each other  are more likely to display a relative orbital momentum perpendicular to the surrounding filament . as this momentum",
    "is converted into intrinsic angular momentum during the merger , the remnant is more likely to display a spin perpendicular to that filament .",
    "moreover , galaxies grow in mass from successive mergers .",
    "this was confirmed in the horizon - agn simulation where we found a clear correlation between merger fraction and stellar mass .",
    "indeed , massive ellipticals are much more likely to be the result of mergers , which motivate their tendency to grow an orthogonal spin that will persist , and will not re - align from accretion providing that the galaxy is large enough .    to support this proposition , fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) shows the log(pdf ) of the spin flip angle between successive outputs for different merger ratios .",
    "if all the spins in the sample maintain a fixed orientation , we would expect a dirac function centered on one , while if all the spins get randomly reinitialized at each time step , we expect the uniform pdf ( the dashed line ) . on this figure , we see clearly that non - mergers maintain their spin orientation ( 91 percent within a 25 degrees cone ) while mergers trigger important swings , with a stronger effect for most massive mergers .",
    "this strongly supports the merger - driven swings scenario .",
    "[ fig2](c ) confirms this and displays the pdf of @xmath23 ( as defined above ) for different merger histories : we identify an important excess probability @xmath29 of perpendicular orientation ( @xmath23 close to 0 ) for mergers , with a increased amplitude for higher number of mergers across the history of the galaxy .",
    "moreover the magnitude of this signal is at least comparable to that found for dark haloes in codis et al .",

    "consistently , non - mergers tend to remain aligned to their closest filament .",

    "trace the galactic flips and allow for detection .",
    "*   the scenario detailed here is the eulerian counterpart of the lagrangian theory ( anisotropic ttt ) presented by christophe pichon in the same proceedings , and shows how their predictions pervade down to small scales and low redshifts where non - linear baryonic physics become important ."
