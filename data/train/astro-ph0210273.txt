    "the outcome of the collision between two stars depends on their types ( e.g. , evolutionary phase , mass and radius ) and their kinematic parameters ( e.g. , relative velocity and impact parameter ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    ", central bhs may accrete stellar mass from the following three sources : ( i ) gas released by tidal disruption of stars and stars swallowed whole by central bhs ( mostly for stars on elongated radial orbits which may come close to central bhs ) , ( ii ) gas released by stellar collisions , ( iii ) and gas lost by stellar winds . whether the above three sources are sufficient to account for the present bh mass and which is the main contributor to the bh growth depend on the stellar density distribution and velocity dispersion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the first source in this list , tidal disruption of stars , has been studied by @xcite .",

    "one part of this paper (   [ sec : bhgrowth ] ) studies whether the second source ( i.e. , gas released by stellar collisions ) is sufficient to explain current bh masses in realistic galactic centers .    the colors of galactic centers reflect the constituents of their stellar population , and radial color gradients may provide much information on the formation and evolution of the stellar populations or galaxies . in   [ sec :",
