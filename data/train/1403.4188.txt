    "today , there is a strive for a controlled fabrication of nanomagnets in order to explore the concepts of spintronics at the atomic scale .",
    "much progress was achieved in understanding direct intracluster exchange interactions in ferromagnetic few - atom clusters situated on metal surfaces  ( see e.g.  ref . [ ] and references therein ) , as well as indirect surface - mediated magnetic ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interactions  @xcite .",
    "a central challenge remains the increasing importance of thermal fluctuations in few - atom clusters , which leads to unwanted destabilization of moments . as a consequence , in recent years",
    "the research focus has shifted towards heavy @xmath1 transition - metal substrates , where large spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) gives hope to enhance the magnetic anisotropy and to counteract superparamagnetic behavior .",
    "indeed , for ferromagnetic co structures on pt(111 ) experiments show extraordinary large magnetic anisotropies of up to 9  mev / atom  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been recently realized that in transition - metal nanostructures on surfaces , soc also induces the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction  @xcite .",
    "it favors non - collinear magnetic configurations and can destabilize ferromagnetism even on the atomic scale  @xcite .",
    "less attention has been given to the lighter 4@xmath0 transition metal substrates  @xcite , where effects of relativistic origin such as the dm term and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy are expected to be much smaller .",
    "the exchange interaction , on the other hand , can depend critically on the hybridization with the surface and its band filling .",
    "based on first - principles calculations it has been predicted that the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) exchange coupling changes from antiferromagnetic ( afm ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) for fe monolayers on ru(0001 ) and rh(111 ) , respectively @xcite . since",
    "its magnitude is small , interactions beyond nns as well as higher - order terms beyond the pair - wise heisenberg exchange , such as the four - spin and biquadratic interactions , can play a decisive role for the magnetic order  @xcite .",
    "magnetic configurations that are surprising for fe have been predicted for those substrates , namely a nel state with angles of @xmath2 between adjacent spins for fe monolayers on ru(0001 ) , and a collinear double row - wise afm @xmath3-state on rh(111 ) .",
    "these two systems are thus ideal candidates to systematically study the formation of complex magnetic phases driven by frustrated interactions beyond nn heisenberg exchange .    here",
    "we show the essential importance of fe 3@xmath0 state itinerancy and hybridization with partially filled 4@xmath0 substrate bands in monatomic - height fe clusters of different atomic size @xmath4 and various geometries .",
    "randomly positioned single fe atom spins in the dilute regime ( @xmath5 ) indirectly interact via the rkky mechanism which shows inverted character on ru(0001 ) and rh(111 ) . for fe dimers ( @xmath6 )",
    "we prove the afm ( ru ) to fm ( rh ) cross - over of the nn exchange coupling constant @xmath7 , and for larger clusters ( @xmath8 ) the onset of cluster geometry dependent compensated magnetic structures , both predicted by our first - principles calculations .",
    "we demonstrate that compact clusters are ferromagnetic while open structures exhibit compensated antiferromagnetic states .",
    "the origin of this unexpected trend arises from the competition of direct fe - fe exchange in the clusters and indirect exchange mediated by the substrate .",
    "finally , we present experimental evidence for the formation of compensated spin textures both for ru(0001 ) and rh(111 ) in fully ordered epitaxial fe islands .",
    "x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) experiments were carried out at the id08 beamline of the european synchrotron radiation facility ( esrf ) , where samples can be prepared in - situ under uhv conditions.ru(0001 ) and rh(111 ) single crystal surfaces were prepared by cycles of ar - sputtering and annealing at 900@xmath9c .",
    "a scanning tunneling microscope allows to verify the cleanliness of the single crystal surfaces .",
    "fe of 99.99@xmath10 purity was deposited onto ru(0001 ) and rh(111 ) from a rod by electron bombardment heating .",
    "a precise calibration of the evaporator was done with the help of the scanning tunneling microscope.during the x - ray measurements the pressure in the magnet chamber was @xmath11 mbar .",
    "possible contaminations containing oxygen were excluded by monitoring the o k - edge signal at around @xmath12ev .",
    "x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) were measured at the fe @xmath13-edges with 99@xmath10 positive and negative circularly polarized light ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) using the surface sensitive total electron yield ( tey ) mode .",
    "xmcd and xas signals are then defined as the difference @xmath16 and the average @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the fe @xmath13 xas contribution to the tey is obtained by subtraction of a background signal measured prior to fe deposition .",
    "spectroscopy was done at two angles of incidence with respect to the sample surface : @xmath18 ( in - plane ) and @xmath19 ( polar ) .",
    "magnetic fields up to @xmath20  t are applied parallel to the x - ray beam direction .",
    "both xas and xmcd signals scale with the iron coverage @xmath21 .",
    "thus , all xmcd data shown in this work are normalized to the respective @xmath22 peak amplitude in the non - dichroic fe xas .",
    "the @xmath22 peak value @xmath23 of the normalized xmcd is then a good measure of the projection of the average magnetization @xmath24 on the field direction @xmath25 : @xmath26 .",
    "using _ in - situ _ quench - condensed deposition of submonolayer amounts of fe at low temperatures we achieve a statistical distribution @xmath27 of cluster sizes @xmath4 and their respective geometries @xmath28 on both rh(111 ) and ru(0001 ) due to suppression of diffusion of surface adatoms . fig .",
    "[ impurities](a ) shows examples of xas and xmcd spectra of impurities measured at @xmath20 t and @xmath29k .",

    "first we note that the non - dichroic xas @xmath22 peak positions shift by @xmath32ev to higher photon energies ( blue data ) .",
    "positive shifts are characteristic for increasing hybridization between fe 3@xmath0 states , which leads to more efficient screening of core - hole effects during x - ray absorption .",

    "[ impurities](b ) and ( c ) the evolution of the magnetic signal with raising @xmath31 is shown .",
    "the trend of @xmath34 for fe on ru(0001 ) shows a steady decay of the average magnetization with fe coverage , indicating progressive magnetic compensation . comparing the @xmath23 values for @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    ", we observe an in - plane magnetic anisotropy in the range @xmath35  ml . for fe clusters on rh(111 )",
    "we find an even steeper initial decrease of @xmath23 with coverage and at low coverages an in - plane magnetic anisotropy .",
    "in contrast to ru(0001 ) , at an intermediate coverage @xmath36  ml the magnetization reaches a minimum and increases monotonously thereafter .    in order to understand the observed trends of the magnetization with coverage",
    ", we have performed first - principles calculations based on density functional theory ( dft ) for fe clusters of different size and shape on both surfaces .",
    "we have applied the projector - augmented - wave method as implemented in the vienna ab - initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite and used the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to the exchange - correlation functional @xcite .",
    "we consider different collinear magnetic configurations of the clusters and compare their total energies taking vertical and lateral structural relaxations into account .",
    "computational details can be found in the appendix a.    at low coverage there will be mostly a distribution of single adatoms which can interact with each other via the exchange interaction mediated by the substrate .",
    "therefore , we first focus on the exchange interaction between two fe adatoms as a function of their distance .",
    "the exchange constants @xmath37 obtained from total energy calculations are presented in fig .",
    "[ exchange_j ] .",
    "as expected we observe an oscillatory behavior of @xmath37 changing from fm ( @xmath38 ) to afm ( @xmath39 ) and a decay of its magnitude with increasing fe - fe separation .",
    "interestingly , the trend found for fe dimers on the rh and ru surface is almost perfectly inverted .",
    "in contrast to the exchange interaction reported for substrates with a filled @xmath0-band @xcite we find that the nn exchange constant @xmath7 is reduced by about one order of magnitude and , thus , in competition with indirect exchange interactions @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",

    "[ de_clusters](a ) and ( b ) , respectively , display a complex dependence of the magnetic order on the cluster geometry . for rh(111 )",
    "we find that compact trimers and tetramers possess a fm ground state which is in accordance with the fm nn exchange coupling from the dimer calculations ( cf .",
    "[ exchange_j ] ) although the energy differences are much larger than expected from the exchange constants obtained from the dimers .",
    "however , fe clusters in an open structure show a tendency to afm order with compensated spin structures .",
    "this is surprising in view of the fm exchange interaction of the dimers .",
    "interestingly , the open tetramers already display the @xmath3 state predicted for the full monolayer .",
    "these effects arise due to a competition of direct fe - fe exchange and indirect exchange mediated by the substrate which are closely linked with the cluster geometry and structural relaxations that differ for open and compact structures  @xcite .",
    "the impact of the structural relaxation on the magnetic state is evident from fig .",
    "[ de_clusters](a ) if one compares the energy differences obtained without taking structural relaxations into account . in the case of a nn dimer on rh(111 )",
    "the exchange energy is reduced by one order of magnitude upon relaxation , leading to the very low value of 6  mev / fe - atom .",
    "a considerable reduction of the energy difference occurs also for the compact trimers and tetramers .",
    "for most of the open cluster configurations , the energetically favorable state even changes from a fm to a compensated state upon taking structural relaxations into account .",
    "a similar trend of magnetic order is found for fe trimers and tetramers on ru(0001 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ de_clusters](b ) . for open structures , compensated afm spin structures",
    "are found which is expected from the afm nn exchange in fe dimers ( cf .",
    "[ exchange_j ] ) .",
    "note , that the afm nn exchange is driven by the hybridization with the substrate .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the energy differences for the fe dimer without structural relaxation which prefers a fm state ( see fig .  [ de_clusters](b ) )",
    ". however , compact trimers and tetramers are in a fm ground state .",
    "the origin of this unexpected change of exchange coupling in the clusters is due to the enhanced direct fm fe - fe exchange interaction and a weakened effect of the ru substrate . in order to obtain a quantitative interpretation of our experimental data based on the magnetic configurations calculated from first - principles we performed monte - carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "knowing the magnetic ground states of all cluster configurations @xmath44 with @xmath45 , mc simulations of @xmath27 allows us to estimate the coverage dependent average magnetization of the ensemble in a magnetic field @xmath20 t .",
    "we assume each cluster to be magnetically independent and that each single adatom interacts only with one closest single atom via the rkky interaction as described in the supplementary .",
    "the magnetic contribution of a certain cluster with @xmath44 to the total signal @xmath23 is then given by a boltzmann statistics weighted according to @xmath27 , where also induced substrate moments enter the zeeman energy term ( see appendix b for further details ) .",
    "the low coverage behavior ( @xmath46ml ) of @xmath23 shown in fig .",
    "[ impurities ] can be understood based on the rkky interactions and the nn exchange constant @xmath7 . in the simpler case of ru(0001 )",
    "the magnetization trend at low coverages is dominated by the afm nn exchange constant @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "[ impurities](b ) the result for magnetically independent clusters excluding rkky interactions is shown , which reproduces the continuous decay of the magnetization well , considering that the modeling contains no free parameter . at lowest coverage",
    ", @xmath23 corresponds to a single spin moment of 3.0@xmath48 as obtained from our dft calculations in the corresponding zeeman field .    turning to the case of fe clusters on rh(111 ) , we find that @xmath23 at lowest coverages is larger compared to the values found for ru(0001 ) , which we attribute to ( i ) the enhanced spin moment 3.2@xmath48 of a single fe atom on rh(111 ) and ( ii ) the about ten times larger magnetic susceptibility of rh(111 ) leading to larger induced substrate moments .",
    "the latter enter the boltzmann statistics via the zeeman term and stabilize the fe spin moments .",
    "it is evident that even a qualitative understanding of the trend @xmath34 based on the nn exchange interaction is impossible in the case of rh .",
    "the steep decrease of @xmath23 at lowest coverages is surprising in view of the positive nn exchange coupling @xmath7 .",
    "starting from single atoms the increase of @xmath21 should thus enhance the average magnetization per fe atom due to fm dimer formation as seen by the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ impurities](c ) .",
    "however , if we take into account the rkky coupling between single fe atoms on rh(111 ) we observe that the afm exchange coupling for separations of up to 6  @xmath49 overcompensate by far the contribution of the fm nn dimer coupling and accurately reproduces the steep decrease of the average magnetization below @xmath50ml ( solid curve in fig .",
    "[ impurities](c ) ) .    at intermediate coverages ,",
    "mostly the formation of fm dimers and fm compact trimers on rh(111 ) leads to a plateau in @xmath23 in good agreement with our experimental data . according to statistics ,",
    "trimer configurations start to play a role at coverages @xmath51ml , which again suppress the average moment due to intrinsic compensated structures ( see fig .  [ de_clusters ] ) .",
    "for the excellent quantitative agreement between experiment and simulation , the geometry dependent ground states of tetramers as obtained from dft are nevertheless important .",
    "this is visible in the two simulations shown in fig .",
    "[ impurities](c ) for comparison in which it has been assumed that all trimers and tetramers are either perfectly fm or in a maximum compensated magnetic state .",
    "our simulations are valid up to coverages of about @xmath52  ml . beyond",
    "that the simulated values @xmath23 start to decrease due to the increasing spectral weight of clusters with @xmath53 , which in our mc simulations are assumed to have zero moment ( see appendix b ) .",
    "we attribute the rise of the experimental @xmath23 signal to the formation of three - dimensional fm clusters which are less coupled to the substrate and thus will be dominated by the fm direct exchange between fe moments .",
    "vs temperature measured at @xmath20 t and @xmath18 .",
    "full and dotted lines are boltzmann statistics of a superparamagnetic macrospin @xmath54.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    finally , we present experimental evidence for compensated magnetic ground states of fe mls on the hexagonal surfaces ru(0001 ) and rh(111 ) . from the data discussed so far only the measurements on ru(0001 )",
    "are compatible with such a compensated ground state , since the values for @xmath23 reach very low values at high coverages @xmath55ml ( see fig .",
    "[ impurities](b ) ) . for rh(111 ) it is evident that such a state can not be reached by quench - condensed deposition .",
    "this is not really surprising since the structure is expected to be disordered , and beyond nn corrections are strongly hampered in a random fashion .",
    "we therefore test our systems in the presence of structural order .    in fig .",
    "[ islands ]  ( a)-(b ) stm topographies of 5 - 10 nm wide monatomic - height fe islands on ru(0001 ) and rh(111 ) are shown , respectively , which grow epitaxially at deposition temperatures of @xmath56k .",
    "on ru(0001 ) triangular shaped islands with 5 - 10 nm in diameter are formed on the terraces , and smaller islands decorate the terrace step edges .",
    "the onset of the 2nd layer formation on the islands is only visible on ru(0001 ) , but the ratio between bilayer and monolayer areas corresponds to less than @xmath57 . on rh(111 ) , islands of mostly truncated triangular shape are randomly distributed .",

    "k only a small fe dichroic signal of @xmath58 and @xmath59 is present for @xmath50ml on ru(0001 ) and rh(111 ) , indicative of intrinsically compensated magnetic ground states in both cases .",
    "the temperature dependence up to @xmath56  k can be fitted by a classical boltzmann statistics of a constant superparamagnetic macrospin @xmath54  @xcite , suggesting stable ground states up to energy scales beyond 25mev .",
    "as in the quench - condensed samples a faint in - plane magnetic easy direction is observed for both substrates ( see fig .  [ impurities](b ) and ( c ) , where open / full triangles correspond to @xmath19 and @xmath18 ) .",
    "the difference of the island results compared to those obtained by quench - condensed deposition underlines the importance of the structure on the magnetic state .",
    "the stabilization of a compensated magnetic configuration on rh(111 ) against a fm exchange term @xmath60 is only possible for ordered compact clusters , which allow effective hybridization of fe 3@xmath0 states over larger distances .",
    "increased hybridization in the ordered case is also directly visible in the measured xas @xmath22 peak photon energy , which remains @xmath61ev above the value of quench - condensed structures at largest coverages ( see fig .  [",
    "impurities](b ) and ( c ) , top ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown a complex trend of magnetic order in fe nanostructures on @xmath62 transition - metal surfaces due to the hybridization of fe @xmath63-states with the partly filled substrate @xmath62-band . for fe dimers",
    "the nearest - neighbor exchange is very small and of opposite sign on the ru and rh surface . for larger clusters the competition of direct fm fe - fe exchange with the indirect exchange mediated by the substrate determines the magnetic order .",

    "all calculations have been performed in the scalar - relativistic approximation , i.e. neglecting the effect of spin - orbit coupling . to model the fe clusters we have used the @xmath64 and @xmath65 surface unit cells for clusters with @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . to model the rh(111 ) or ru(0001 )",
    "surface eight layers have been used .",

    "a ( @xmath68 ) and ( @xmath69 ) @xmath70-centered k - point mesh has been used for the @xmath64 and @xmath65 surface unit cell , respectively .",

    "the energy cutoff parameter for the plane wave expansion was 390 ev and a gaussian smearing of @xmath71 ev has been applied .",
    "an important aspect of our approach to calculate the exchange constants is the possible interaction of the clusters with those in adjacent cells due to the two - dimensional ( 2d ) periodic boundary conditions . in order to estimate the influence of atoms in neighboring cells we have performed test calculations in the @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath65 unit cells .",
    "we found that the @xmath64 unit cell size is sufficiently large to avoid spurious interaction effects for compact clusters and to determine their magnetic ground state .",
    "however , if the distance between the adatoms within the unit cell is large as for dimers with large separation , the influence of atoms in the adjacent unit cells also becomes important .",
    "we have taken such interactions into account when determining the rkky exchange constants .",
    "more detailed information can be found in ref .",
    "during the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation iron atoms are randomly deposited onto two hexagonal hcp and fcc sublattices , each of which have a size of 500@xmath74500 . since in the experiment",
    "the atoms are deposited at a temperature of @xmath29  k no thermal activated hopping of atoms is included in the simulation .",
    "however , we do take into account random tip - over processes onto neighboring free adsorption sites , if the initial mc step chooses a landing site which is already occupied by an iron atom . during one mc deposition cycle the sum of the number of atoms on both sublattices is increased by 0.02@xmath10 of a full monolayer ( ml ) .",
    "after every mc deposition cycle the program counts the different types of clusters : an atom is evaluated as a monomer if it has no nearest neighbor ( nn ) on the same lattice , two atoms are evaluated as a dimer if they have just themselves as nns , and so on . moreover , the program distinguishes between different geometries @xmath28 for one and the same cluster size @xmath4 , e.g. between linear trimers and trimers with an angle .",
    "the mc simulation thus gives access to the distribution @xmath27 of all different cluster configurations ( @xmath75 ) from monomers to tetramers ( @xmath76 ) both on hcp or fcc sublattices .",
    "figure  [ statistics](a ) reflects the statistics of cluster counts with size @xmath76 versus coverage .",

    "is extracted , evaluating the combination of monomer pairs on hcp and fcc lattices from 2nd nn up to 5th nn distances for a given mc distribution .",
    "herby , we only count pairs for which other monomers are found only at larger distances .",
    "this approximation thus assumes that for these pairs , residual oscillating rkky field contributions of other surrounding monomers and pairs in average cancel each other and play a minor role .",

    "figure  [ statistics](a ) shows the statistics of cluster counts with size @xmath4 versus coverage , while fig .",
    "[ statistics](b ) translates this statistics into spectral weights contributing to the x - ray absorption signal .",

    "<S> we demonstrate the occurrence of compensated spin configurations in fe clusters and monolayers on ru(0001 ) and rh(111 ) by a combination of x - ray magnetic circular dichroism experiments and first - principles calculations . </S>",
    "<S> our results reveal complex intra - cluster exchange interactions which depend strongly on the substrate 4@xmath0-band filling , the cluster geometry as well as lateral and vertical structural relaxations . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of substrate 4@xmath0-band filling manifests itself also in small nearest - neighbor exchange interactions in fe dimers and in an nearly inverted trend of the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida coupling constants for fe adatoms on the ru and rh surface . </S>"
