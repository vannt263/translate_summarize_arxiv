    "processes with rapidity gaps at hadron colliders provide an attractive possibility ( i ) to search for new physics ( higgs boson , susy particles , etc . ) in a clean environment ( see for example , @xcite and references therein ) and ( ii ) to study the properties of the diffractive amplitude . unfortunately , the cross sections for such processes are suppressed by the small probability , @xmath10 , that the rapidity gaps survive soft rescattering effects between the interacting hadrons , which can generate secondary particles populating the gaps @xcite@xcite .    in general , we may write the survival factor @xmath10 in a multi - channel eikonal framework in the form @xmath11 where an incoming proton is decomposed into diffractive eigenstates , each with its own opacity , where the indices refer to the eigenstates of the two incoming and two outgoing hadrons .",

    "the opacities @xmath16 of the proton have been calculated in a number of models @xcite , and used to determine @xmath10 for various rapidity gap processes .",

    "the calculations of @xmath10 can , in principle , be checked by computing the event rate for processes such as central @xmath17 production by @xmath18 fusion @xcite or central dijet production with a rapidity gap on either side @xcite , and comparing with the experimental rate . however , to date , the only such check has been the prediction of the diffractive dijet production at the tevatron in terms of the diffractive structure functions measured at hera @xcite .",
    "we may regard these as ` integrated ' checks .",

    "to gain insight into how @xmath35 exchange processes allow a probe of the rapidity gap survival factor , we first perform a simplified evaluation of the diagrams of fig .  1 .",

    "1(b ) , may be written in the factorized form @xmath42 where @xmath43 , the effective number of photons , is well known @xcite . for small @xmath44 it is safe to neglect longitudinally polarised photons and to consider only the number of transversely polarised photons . for @xmath45 , neglecting terms of higher order in @xmath46 we have @xmath47 where , in the absence of rescattering @xmath48 . here",

    ", we have set the slope @xmath75 , that is the @xmath76 subprocess is assumed to occur at zero impact parameter .",
    "the upper curve , @xmath77 , is proportional to the cross section for the photon - mediated process @xmath78 of fig .",

    "the diffractive dip in the region of @xmath80 , due to the destructive interference of the @xmath81 and @xmath82 amplitudes , is clearly evident .",
    "the dip is partially filled in by the presence of the @xmath83 contribution to ( [ eq : a7 ] ) , which leads to a small @xmath84 term .",
    "it is clear that a measurement of the @xmath44 dependence of the cross section will provide a scan of the rapidity gap survival probability @xmath10 , that is of the proton optical density @xmath85 .",
    "it is seen that rescattering gives more than an order of magnitude suppression in the region @xmath86 .",
    "so far we have considered only the amplitude which conserves the @xmath87-channel proton helicity at the vertex with the exchanged photon .",
    "this non - flip amplitude is described by the @xmath54 electromagnetic form factor of the proton .",
    "however as @xmath88 increases the helicity at the photon vertex may be flipped by the proton s anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the spin - flip amplitude is described by the form factor @xmath89 .",
    "neglecting terms of order @xmath90 the amplitude is given by an expression analogous to ( [ eq : a6 ] ) , with @xmath54 replaced by @xmath91 . in almost all of the results presented below we include the spin - flip contribution , although , for simplicity , we write the formulae in terms of the non - flip amplitude alone .",
    "the exception is fig .",
    "the comparison of fig .  3 with fig .",
    "4 shows that the effect of the spin - flip contribution is quite small .",
    "so far we have studied photon - exchange reactions in hadron colliders with the neglect of photon polarisation , as is often done in the equivalent photon approach . however , when we include soft @xmath4 rescattering effects , we must take care .",
    "frequently for photon exchange processes we deal with expressions of the form @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the photon polarisation vectors of the amplitude and the complex conjugate amplitude respectively . at small @xmath46 the polarisation vector @xmath93 is aligned with the transverse momentum @xmath95 .",
    "we take @xmath93 in the direction @xmath96 . without rescattering , fig .",
    "1(a ) , we have @xmath97 , whereas for the rescattering contribution , fig",
    ".  1(b ) , we have @xmath98 .",
    "in the latter case we see that the photon polarisation depends on the loop momentum @xmath99 , and so we must work in terms of the two different polarisation states .",
    "it is convenient to choose a linear polarisation basis .",
    "we take one polarisation vector @xmath100 aligned with @xmath101 ( which is the polarisation vector of the photon in the absence of rescattering ) , and the other , @xmath102 , perpendicular to @xmath100 . the amplitude @xmath81 of fig .",
    "1(a ) proceeds only via the first polarisation vector and hence the @xmath103 cross section via @xmath35-exchange has the form @xmath104    let us study the impact of @xmath105 on the interference term between the amplitudes @xmath81 and @xmath106 . in general , we have @xmath107 where the minus sign arises because @xmath106 is negative relative to @xmath81 due to the absorptive nature of pomeron exchange . for very small values of @xmath41",
    "we see that @xmath108 is antiparallel to @xmath99 . moreover , the main contribution of fig .",
    "1(b ) comes from the smaller values of @xmath109 , and so @xmath99 tends to be antiparallel to @xmath110 .",
    "hence @xmath108 tends to be parallel to @xmath110 , and @xmath111 on the other hand , as @xmath41 increases , @xmath108 becomes more and more parallel to @xmath101 .",
    "hence @xmath112 > from ( [ eq : a13 ] ) we see that the interference term depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath113 between the transverse momenta of the outgoing protons , @xmath101 and @xmath110 . for very small @xmath101 , we have _ constructive _ interference if @xmath101 and @xmath110 are back - to - back ( that is if @xmath114 ) , and _ destructive _ interference when @xmath101 and @xmath110 are aligned ( @xmath115 ) . as @xmath41 increases",
    ", @xmath108 becomes more and more aligned with @xmath101 , rather than @xmath110 , and we have destructive interference for all azimuthal angles @xmath113 , see ( [ eq : b13 ] ) .",
    "the evaluation of the exclusive process @xmath116 is described in section  5 .",
    "however it is informative to show a sample of these results now , in order to illustrate the effects of including the proper treatment of the photon polarisation .",
    "3 shows the differential cross section at energy @xmath117  gev appropriate to rhic for a realistic choice of kinematic variables .",
    "the ( dotted ) reference curve , denoted by @xmath77 , is the naive estimate based on fig .",
    "it was obtained by multiplying the @xmath118 cross section by the equivalent photon flux , ( [ eq : a3 ] ) . for simplicity here we neglect the contributions which flip the spin of the proton .",
    "the other curves in fig .",
    "3 show the effect of including the rescattering contribution of fig .  1(b ) . we take a realistic slope @xmath119 for the @xmath30 subprocess , as described in section  5 .    the dashed curves in fig .",
    "3 show the predictions for the @xmath120 cross section which include the correct treatment of the photon polarisation , for three different choices of the azimuthal angle , namely @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate the anticipated behaviour obtained in ( [ eq : a13 ] ) and ( [ eq : b13 ] ) . for @xmath114 the rescattering amplitude @xmath106 has the largest absolute value .",
    "it is positive for small @xmath88 and reverses sign as @xmath88 increases . as a consequence ,",
    "the diffractive dip is deeper and narrower than the simple prediction shown in fig .  2 .",
    "for @xmath115 and @xmath123 the amplitude @xmath82 is negative everywhere and relatively smaller , which shifts the respective dips outside the region of interest .",
    "besides , allowing for the effects of photon polarisation , there is another complication that we must consider .",
    "as @xmath88 increases , we have to include the contributions of diagrams analogous to those shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "but with the photon and pomeron exchanges interchanged .",
    "that is we must include contributions from ` inverted ' diagrams with the photon coupled to the lower proton vertex .",
    "their contribution is negligibly small for very small @xmath124 and larger values of @xmath46 , but increases significantly in the dip region .",
    "the results obtained after including these extra amplitudes are shown by the three continuous curves in fig .",
    "3 . it is interesting to note that for @xmath125 the extra diagrams have a large effect in the region where @xmath41 becomes comparable to @xmath126 , and lead to a cross section even larger than that due to the reference @xmath77 prediction in the absence of rescattering .",
    "before we consider specific examples of @xmath103 production via photon exchange , we describe a more realistic way to evaluate rescattering corrections than that described in section  2 .",
    "we use the formalism and the results of ref .",
    "the formalism embodies ( i ) pion - loop insertions to the pomeron trajectory , ( ii ) two - channel eikonal description of proton - proton rescattering and ( iii ) high mass diffractive dissociation .",
    "the parameters of the model were tuned to describe all the main features of the soft @xmath4 data throughout the cern - isr to the tevatron energy interval . in terms of the two - channel eikonal",
    "the incoming proton is described by two diffractive eigenstates @xmath127 , each with its own absorptive cross section .",

    "@xcite for tevatron @xmath138 and lhc @xmath139 energies .    as before , we work in momentum space , and replace ( [ eq : a7 ] ) by @xmath140 hence the amplitude of fig .",
    "1(b ) becomes @xmath141 in analogy to ( [ eq : a8 ] ) .",
    "the amplitude @xmath58 is defined below ( [ eq : a6 ] ) .",
    "although here we show only i m  @xmath142 , we include the contribution from re  @xmath142 as described in section  2 .",
    "here we study the photon - mediated exclusive reaction , @xmath120 of fig .  1 , in more detail .",

    ".    now the full calculation of the differential cross section for the exclusive process @xmath148 via photon exchange goes well beyond the equivalent photon approach described in section  2 .",
    "first we must allow for the proper treatment of the photon polarisation as discussed in section  3 .",
    "then we must include the amplitudes of inverted diagrams , analogous to those in fig .  1 but with the photon coupled to the lower proton .",
    "4 shows the final result for a realistic rhic configuration .",
    "the effect of rescattering is clearly pronounced in the region @xmath149 , and displays a rich @xmath113 dependence .",
    "recall , @xmath113 is the azimuthal angle between the transverse momenta , @xmath101 and @xmath110 , of the outgoing protons .",
    "the cross section is sizeable .",
    "for example , in a typical bin , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , we expect more than 0.1  pb for @xmath80 .",
    "however the @xmath152 branching ratio has not been included .    in fig .",
    "5 we present the analogous results for @xmath153 collisions collisions the ` inverted ' diagrams enter with the opposite sign .",
    "] at the tevatron energy @xmath154  tev . to demonstrate the sensitivity of the differential cross section to the profile of the proton opacity",
    ", we compare the results obtained using the two - channel eikonal model @xcite , described in section  4 , with the values calculated using the simple @xmath4 gaussian amplitude of ( [ eq : a7 ] ) with the same slope @xmath155 and @xmath156  mb that appear in the two - channel eikonal model .",
    "unfortunately , for the reasons we now discuss , it will be difficult to observe @xmath157 at the tevatron .",
    "it is clearly important to measure the kinematic variables @xmath158 and @xmath159 of the outgoing protons . to study",
    "photon - exchange reactions we require a proton at very small transverse momentum , say @xmath101 .",
    "unfortunately it is not possible to measure very small @xmath158 and @xmath160 simultaneously since , in this case , an outgoing proton scatters into the beam pipe .",
    "thus we choose @xmath161  gev / c and @xmath162 .",
    "indeed , in practice it might be necessary to have @xmath163 .",
    "it is also necessary to identify the @xmath5 vector meson , so as to be sure that we have negative @xmath164 parity production ( and do not replace photon by pomeron exchange ) .    in principle , with very good resolution , it would be possible to observe @xmath5 as a peak in the missing mass spectrum . in practice , this will be extremely difficult . thus we need to observe the decay @xmath152 .",
    "( note that the branching fraction for this decay is not included in the results that we present . )  for tevatron energies , however , with @xmath165 , the muons are emitted at very small centre - of - mass angles , less than @xmath166 .",
    "therefore in section  3 we presented predictions for rhic energies , where the situation is better .",
    "another possibility is to measure only one recoil proton with @xmath161  gev / c and to observe the @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath101 may be deduced as @xmath167 .",
    "however there may be some inelastic contribution from processes in which the undetected proton is knocked into an excited state .",
    "this contribution can be calculated when the upper limit for the mass of the excitation is specified .",
    "qualitatively , the contribution of the excited states acts as if it were described by a spin - flip amplitude , which does not interfere with the main non - flip contribution .    to demonstrate the possible effect ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "6 the prediction which includes the excitation of the unobservable proton into @xmath168 and @xmath169 resonances up to mass @xmath170  gev .",
    "we see that the additional contribution does not spoil the rich @xmath44 and @xmath113 dependence of the differential cross section .",
    "there is a potential background for @xmath171 process coming from double - pomeron @xmath172 production , @xmath173 with @xmath174 .",
    "the cross section for @xmath175 production at the tevatron has been estimated to be @xmath176nb @xcite .",
    "that is @xmath177 at @xmath178 .",
    "the @xmath179 branching fraction is 0.007 , so the background is a few times larger than the signal .",
    "thus , with a @xmath5 mass resolution no better than 0.4  gev , it is necessary to observe the @xmath35 from @xmath172 decay .",
    "the @xmath180 and @xmath181 states have much larger @xmath182 branching fractions , but much smaller production cross sections and give less background than @xmath183 .",
    "in principle , the process @xmath148 may also be mediated by odderon exchange @xcite .",
    "that is the photon in fig .",
    "1 may be replaced by a three - gluon @xmath44-channel state , where each pair of gluons form a symmetric colour octet , @xmath184 .",
    "such a three - gluon state has negative @xmath164-parity and describes odderon exchange .",
    "little is known about the odderon amplitude .",
    "so far , the odderon has not been seen experimentally .",
    "there are indications that the odderon - nucleon coupling is small @xcite .",
    "in particular , the coupling is zero in the specific model in which the nucleon is made up of a quark and a ( point - like ) diquark .    at leading @xmath185 order the intercept of the odderon trajectory",
    "is predicted to be very close to 1 @xcite . from this point of view",
    "a single three - gluon exchange amplitude appears as a natural model for the odderon . for the quark-(charm)quark interaction , shown in fig .  7 , the amplitude is @xmath186 for the case of interest , @xmath45 , we have @xmath187 , @xmath188 is the total momentum transferred by the odderon .",
    "the numerical factor @xmath189 arises from ( i ) the symmetry of the gluons ( 1/3 ! ) , ( ii ) the sum over the gluon colour indices @xmath190 , ( iii ) averaging over the colours of the incoming quarks , and ( iv ) @xmath191 from the feynman loop integration .",
    "fig  7 is not the only , or necessarily the largest - channel gluons could couple directly to the lower proton rather than to the _ c _ quark and , together with another _",

    "for such an estimate we take amplitude ( [ eq : a23 ] ) with an appropriate infrared cut - off given by the size of the @xmath5 meson ; @xmath193 , and assume quark additivity .",
    "that is , we assume the coupling of the odderon to the ( upper ) proton is three times the odderon - quark coupling .",
    "then the odderon - exchange contribution to the proton - charm quark amplitude is @xmath194 using @xmath195 , as compared to the photon - exchange contribution @xmath196 with the charge of the charm quark @xmath197 .",
    "the expression in brackets in ( [ eq : a24 ] ) is the estimate of the integral in ( [ eq : a23 ] ) with cut - offs @xmath198 .",
    "below @xmath199 , the integrand in ( [ eq : a23 ] ) is multiplied by an additional factor @xmath200 . ] comparing ( [ eq : a24 ] ) and ( [ eq : a25 ] ) , it is evident that photon exchange dominates for very small @xmath201 , but already by @xmath202 odderon - exchange may become of comparable importance .",
    "it may be possible to use @xmath113 or @xmath203 vector meson production to distinguish between odderon and @xmath35 exchange .",
    "if we compare @xmath203 to @xmath5 production , then see that the odderon amplitude is suppressed by @xmath204 as compared to @xmath205 .",
    "however the @xmath206 rate via photon - exchange , times the @xmath207 branching fraction , is more than three orders of magnitude smaller than for @xmath5 production , and so the signal will be difficult to observe .",
    "on the other hand , the cross section for @xmath113 production , via photon - exchange , exceeds @xmath5 by a factor of 20 , and so it should be possible to observe the @xmath208 and @xmath3 decay modes . here",
    "the relative magnitude of the photon - exchange amplitude is suppressed by the strange quark charge @xmath209 , while the odderon is enhanced by the large size of the @xmath113 meson .",
    "therefore exclusive @xmath113 production appears to be a promising way to search for the odderon .",

    "however it is unlikely that there is enough intrinsic charm component in the proton at small @xmath46 .",
    "the mechanism is to replace photon exchange by a @xmath210 pair in the @xmath44-channel .",
    "such an amplitude dies out linearly with @xmath46 ( modulo logarithmic corrections ) as compared to photon - exchange contribution . the lowest order perturbative qcd estimate gives a contribution an order - of - magnitude smaller than odderon exchange .",
    "another possible way to investigate rescattering effects is central @xmath1 production in the process @xmath211 , where the @xmath1 boson is separated from the dissociating proton by a large rapidity gap , @xmath212 .",

    "however , now there is almost no correlation between @xmath73 and @xmath60 , as the relatively small loop momentum @xmath73 is separated from the @xmath1 transverse momentum @xmath60 by a long evolution chain .",
    "the only novel point is that in the rescattering term squared , @xmath229 , the loop momenta @xmath73 and @xmath230 ( corresponding to the complex conjugate amplitude ) are correlated via fig .",
    "8(c ) by the form factor @xmath231 .",
    "the slope @xmath232 , associated with the proton - pomeron vertex , characterises the spatial distribution of the quarks in the proton before the dglap evolution .",
    "note that for @xmath211 , as one proton dissociates , there are no complications from ` inverted ' diagrams .",
    "sample results for the @xmath233 differential cross sections at the lhc energy are shown in fig .",
    "the dotted and continuous curves correspond to the results without , and with , rescattering effects respectively . as the azimuthal angle",
    "@xmath113 has been integrated over the diffractive dip , which was clearly visible at @xmath114 for @xmath148 , is now very shallow .",
    "we see that rescattering suppresses the cross section by a factor of about 4 for @xmath234 .",
    "the rescattering is calculated using the prescription of ref .",
    "@xcite . if the more complicated model of ref .",
    "@xcite is used , then we find the predictions change by less than 10% , the effect is maximal in the region of the dip ( @xmath235 gev@xmath236 ) , where the rate rises by about 10% .",
    "of course , the process is hard to observe in the @xmath237 decay mode , due to the huge qcd background .",
    "however , the cross section is large enough to be observed in the leptonic decay modes .",
    "for example , from fig .",
    "9 we see that the @xmath238 bin at @xmath178 has a cross section of about 20  fb . if the momenta of the charged lepton , the outgoing proton and the recoil jet can be measured , then we can reconstruct the mass of the @xmath1 boson .",
    "the exclusive process @xmath239 proceeds via @xmath32 fusion .",
    "again we avoid the odderon or @xmath240 exchange mechanisms .",
    "the qed @xmath241 cross section can be calculated to good accuracy , and if we select events with very small @xmath41 of the leading proton , then the process may even be used to measure the incoming @xmath4-luminosity @xcite . on the other hand , as @xmath41 increases the reaction becomes sensitive to the rapidity gaps survival factor @xmath10 . hence , by varying the transverse momentum @xmath41 we may scan the proton - proton opacity @xmath242 .",
    "the experimental problem is that to obtain a sufficient event rate we need to identify leptons ( either muons or electrons ) with transverse energy , @xmath243 , as small as 1 or 2  gev and large rapidity  mev we require @xmath244 . for the lhc",
    "it means that the longitudinal momentum of the lepton is @xmath245  gev . thus the rapidity @xmath246 , and the polar angle of the lepton @xmath247 .",
    "] , @xmath248 .    to illustrate the size of the effect we use a simplified form of the qed cross section , which corresponds to the limit @xmath249 and @xmath250 , where @xmath251 are the photon momenta and @xmath250 is the lepton mass . after averaging over the azimuthal angle of the transverse momentum @xmath252 of the lepton ,",
    "the @xmath253 subprocess amplitude squared is , see ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath254 as before , we use @xmath255 to denote the photon transverse momenta in the complex conjugate amplitude . the relatively complicated form is associated with the polarisation vectors @xmath256 of the photons , which are parallel to the photon transverse momenta . instead of a simple form like @xmath257 , which occurred in @xmath5 production , we now face correlations like @xmath258 . after including all such terms , and averaging over the @xmath252 direction we obtain ( [ eq : a31 ] ) .",
    "recall that in the rescattering contribution the primed photon momenta @xmath259 of the complex conjugate amplitude , may differ from the momenta @xmath260 occurring in the amplitude ( and analogously for @xmath261 ) , see fig .",
    "3(a , b ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the absence of rescattering",
    "we put @xmath262 and/or @xmath263 .",
    "finally , the cross section ( [ eq : a31 ] ) has to be convoluted with the fluxes ( [ eq : a4 ] ) for photons of momentum @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "sample results are presented in fig .",
    "10 for the lhc energy .",
    "the cross section has been integrated over the mass of the muon pair , with the cut @xmath266  gev on each muon .",
    "again we see a clear diffractive dip at @xmath267 for the back - to - back proton configuration , @xmath114 .",
    "unfortunately the cross section is small and will make observation difficult .    in analogy to @xmath5 production",
    ", it may be possible to measure only recoil proton and to observe the @xmath268 pair , with @xmath101 reconstructed via @xmath269 .",
    "here we can benefit from the high muon momentum resolution .",
    "we have demonstrated that @xmath35-exchange processes at hadron colliders ( such as @xmath270 provide a good testing ground for checking our ability to calculate the effects of rescattering , and in this way to scan the survival probability of rapidity gaps .",
    "we have taken the centrally produced system to be either the @xmath5 vector meson or the @xmath1 boson or a @xmath34 pair .",
    "we have emphasized the important role played by photon polarisation ; it may even reverse the sign of the absorptive corrections for small @xmath44 and @xmath114 ( where @xmath113 is the azimuthal angle between the transverse momenta of the two outgoing protons ) .    the interference between the pure @xmath35 exchange amplitude @xmath81 and the amplitude @xmath106 with rescattering effects generates a rich diffractive structure of the differential cross section for processes of the type @xmath271 .",
    "the tagging of both the leading protons , together with the centrally produced system , allows the rich @xmath44 and @xmath113 dependence of the cross section to be measured . in this way the optical density of the proton - proton rescattering interaction can be probed as a function of the impact parameter .    for lhc energies , @xmath1 boson production with a rapidity gap ,",
    "looks the most promising probe of the gap survival probability . on the other hand , the @xmath5 production process looks more realistic at rhic energies ( provided the background from @xmath272 can be supressed ) . indeed",
    "a comparison of @xmath5 and @xmath113 meson production also offers an attractive opportunity to search for odderon - exchange .",
    "we thank risto orava and krzysztof piotrzkowski for interesting discussions .",
    "one of us ( vak ) thanks the leverhulme trust for a fellowship .",
