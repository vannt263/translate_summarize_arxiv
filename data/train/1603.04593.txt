    "the radio natures of narrow - line seyfert  1 ( nls1s ) galaxies potentially provide us key understandings of outflowing mechanisms in the growing phase of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "nls1s as a class are thought to be fed at high mass accretion rates onto relatively small - mass black holes , potentially connecting between stellar - mass and supermassive black hole systems in the mass function . the first systematic studies in radio bands by interferometric observations were carried out at arc - second resolutions using the very large array  ( vla ) , and indicated little difference between nls1s and seyfert galaxies : similar radio luminosities , steep radio spectra , and scarcely resolved radio morphology suggest the presence of weak nonthermal jets as a radio emitting source @xcite , although several optical / x - ray properties are clearly different",
    "nls1s were thought to be radio - quiet objects as a class with only a few exceptions of known radio - loud objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; subsequent systematic studies based on large database , such as the vla faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ; @xcite ) and the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) in radio and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) in optical , have revealed a lower fraction of radio - loud objects ( @xmath0% ; @xcite , see also @xcite ) compared to that of broad - line seyfert galaxies .",
    "recently , gamma - ray detections by _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ toward six nls1s galaxies with high significance @xcite have offered a new population of gamma - ray emitting agns other than blazars and radio galaxies .",
    "the radio observations at high angular resolutions using very - long - baseline interferometry  ( vlbi ) for the first discovered @xmath1-ray emitting nls1 sdss  j094857.31 + 002225.4 ( pmn  j0948 + 0022 ) had revealed the presences of a one - sided pc - scale jet and a rapidly variable , very high brightness radio core showing an inverted spectrum at the nucleus @xcite .",
    "pmn  j0948 + 0022 also shows a core - dominant structure with two - sided kpc - scale radio emissions @xcite .",
    "the combination of these radio / gamma - ray properties is reminiscent of blazars , which are characterized by doppler - beaming on relativistic jets viewed from pole - on typically at parsec  ( pc ) scales and by decelerated components at from kpc to mpc scales .",
    "vlbi observations of the other several gamma - ray emitting nls1s also indicate the presence of beamed jets at pc scales @xcite ; some of them also show two - sided kpc - scale radio structures @xcite .",
    "however , the radio jets are mildly relativistic and their powers are comparable to the least energetic blazars , on the basis of single - dish monitoring @xcite .    on the other hand , vlbi observations of radio - loud nls1s including gamma - ray detections / non - detections have revealed that the radio - loud aspect is possibly attributed not only to a beaming effect but also an intrinsically large radio power .",
    "intrinsic radio powers that are corrected for the beaming effect using estimated doppler factors suggest that radio - loud nls1s include both intrinsically radio - loud and intrinsically radio - quiet cases @xcite .",
    "an extended pc - scale jet showing a steep spectrum dominates a total radio power , which suggests being not so relativistic and/or sufficiently inclined with respect to our line of sight for the jet @xcite .",
    "seven out of known ten nls1s with kpc - scale radio structures ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) are not still gamma - ray detected .",
    "this situation suggests that jet powers may be intrinsically large sufficient to escape the core regions of host galaxies , but not so beamed because of relatively large viewing angles . for several nearby radio - quiet nls1s ,",
    "vlbi observations have also revealed pc - scale jet - like structures showing steep spectra , which are presumably generated through the same process as that of radio - loud nls1s , but probably with an only difference in power or viewing angle for nonthermal jets @xcite .",
    "thus , at least a fraction of nls1 nuclei has an ability to generate nonthermal jets , which have a wide range of radio powers ; in some cases , the signatures of beaming effect on relativistic jets viewed from pole - on are observed .",
    "however , a limited number of nls1s has still been investigated at milli - arcsecond ( mas ) resolutions so far , because nls1s are relatively weak radio sources in comparison with the other agn classes .",
    "systematic vlbi observations have been started by the other authors @xcite , whose targets are sixteen radio - loud nls1s selected from several parent samples with 105  sources ; fourteen sources were detected at 5 and 6.7  ghz , which were relatively low frequencies and may tend to be biased to the contribution of an extended jet component .",
    "the present paper reports the result of a new vlbi detection survey as a systematic study for nls1s in the radio band at a higher frequency ( 22  ghz ) , where an inner jet component is potentially focused on .",
    "our observation was planned before the publication of @xcite .",
    "our sample selection was relatively similar to theirs ; the differences are ( 1 )  the combination of parent samples , ( 2 )  including radio - quiet nls1s as well , and ( 3 )  at a higher observing frequency .",
    "section  [ section : sample ] presents the sample selection . in sections  [ section : observation ] and [ section : reduction ] , vlbi observations and the procedures of data reductions are described .",
    "these results are presented and its implications are briefly discussed in section  [ section : result ] .",
    "we selected nls1 radio sources by position - matching between the catalog of the very large array  ( vla ) 1.4-ghz faint images of the radio sky at twenty cm  ( first ) survey @xcite and source lists in the following nls1 studies : ( 1 )  64  sources in @xcite , ( 2 )  2011  sources in @xcite , ( 3 )  23  sources in @xcite , and ( 4 )  62  sources in @xcite .",
    "we found several sources that were counted redundantly ; the number of uniquely selected sources resulted in 233  sources ( 7340.8  mjy  beam@xmath2 ) .",
    "we clipped these sources into 41  sources with an intensity higher than 10  mjy  beam@xmath2 .",
    "the nls1 radio source catalogue that is a target list in the present study is listed in table  [ table : sample ] .",
    "the sample selection criteria are similar to those of the previous systematic vlbi study by @xcite , which was also based on the radio selected samples with flux densities of @xmath3  mjy in the first .",
    "the parent samples were restricted to only radio - loud objects from @xcite , which were slightly different from ours including radio - quiet ones as well .",
    "six radio - quiet objects are included in our sample ( @xmath4 , see col .",

    "the observations are performed as a part of the experimental observations to test a developing octave - das ( data acquisition system , @xcite ) .",
    "it is a candidate of the next generation data recording system for octave  ( optically connected array for vlbi exploration , @xcite ) , jvn  ( japanese vlbi network , @xcite ) and other vlbi arrays .",
    "octave - das consists of three key components .",
    "the first is a high speed analog - to - digital  ( a / d ) converter at a sampling rate of 8  gigabits per  second  ( gbps ) of 3  bit quantization .",
    "it is called octad  ( octave a / d converter ) .",
    "it is able to sample signals at a radio frequency  ( rf ) directly .",
    "in addition , it has digital base - band converter  ( dbbc ) functions for the vlbi global observing system  ( vgos ) observation .",
    "the second key component is a media converter between single 10  gige  ( gigabit ethernet ) port and four vsi - h  ( vlbi standard interface - hardware ) i / o ports .",
    "it is called octavia  ( octave vlbi interface adapter ) or octavia2 depending on its version .",
    "the last key component is a recorder .",
    "it is able to record the data stream at the rate from 4.5  gbps up to 32  gbps .",
    "it is called octadisk  ( octave disk recorder ) , octadisk2 or vsrec ( vlbi software recorder ) depending on its version .",
    "octave - das is being developed at the mizusawa vlbi observatory , a branch of the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "the test observations using octave - das were conducted on april  21 and 28 , 2014 using four radio telescopes of the vlbi exploration of radio astrometry project  ( vera ; @xcite ) ; mizusawa , ogasawara , iriki , and ishigaki stations participated in the experiment .",

    "the new system was installed on a - beam for this test observation to increase the sensitivity of target sources",
    ". the received signal of a - beam was divided to two signals for the current and the new system .",
    "the signal for the new systems is divided to four if channels of which bandwidth is 512  mhz .",
    "the starting frequencies of the four ifs are 21.459 , 21.971 , 22.483 , and 22.995  ghz .",

    "the dual beam systems with the current vera system and octave - das can work simultaneously .",

    ", there is no strong source potentially confusing to our observation .",
    "fbqs  j1713 + 352 was positively detected with baselines of all the four antennas in fringe fitting without a calibrator ( because its calibrator was not detected in b - beam ) . around this source , there is no strong source potentially confusing to our observation . both the two sources are weak radio sources at 1.4  ghz in the first ( 15.42  mjy and 11.24  mjy for fbqs  j114654.2 + 323652 ( 1994.4 ) and fbqs  j1713 + 352 ( 1994.5 ) , respectively ) ; on the other hand , they are relatively strong at 22  ghz in our observation ( 104  mjy and 138  mjy ) . these sources should be inverted spectrum sources with @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the spectral index ( @xmath24 ) , assuming that the 1.4  ghz first ( and the 22  ghz ) fluxes do not vary significantly in @xmath25  years .",
    "such a weak source showing an inverted spectrum has also been previously reported by @xcite for fbqs  j1629 + 4007 , which is also in the list of the present study and has been detected ( 11.95  mjy at 1.4  ghz ( 1994.6 ) and 145  mjy at 22  ghz ) . in the first place ,",
    "relatively weak radio emissions at 1.4  ghz and a limited baseline sensitivity at 22  ghz were supposed to strongly bias vlbi detections toward inverted spectrum sources .",
    "in fact , all the detected sources except for one ( 11/12 ) show flat or inverted spectra ( @xmath26@xmath27 ) between 1.422  ghz , if variability in the time interval between measurements at 1.4 and 22  ghz is assumed insignificant .",
    "although this is a sort of artificial effect , it is noteworthy that not so small fraction of nls1 radio sources ( 12/40 ) have been detected at such a high frequency even with very long baselines .    on the other hand ,",
    "at least half of the sources indicate apparently steep spectra ( @xmath28 ) between 1.4  ghz and 22  ghz on the basis of the first flux densities and the vlbi upper limits .",
    "both the inverted and steep spectrum radio sources are included in the nls1 population , as previously pointed out by several authors @xcite .",
    "particularly , @xmath29hb89@xmath30 $ ]  1044 + 476 is the strongest radio source ( 767.44  mjy at 1.4  ghz in the first ( 1997.2 ) ) in our sample but not detected with the vlbi at 22  ghz ( @xmath31  mjy ) . only a weak radio emission ( 19.4  mjy ) with a core - jet structure in the east - west direction has been previously found in vlbi images at 5  ghz while vla images at 8.4 and 22  ghz show significantly large radio flux densities ; a bulk of total flux must be resolved out with very long baselines and originate in extended components of a compact steep spectrum source @xcite .",
    "b3  1702 + 457 is in the similar situation ( 118.64  mjy at first 1.4  ghz ( 1997.2 ) and @xmath32  mjy at vlbi 22  ghz ) ; the previous vlbi studies revealed an extended radio structure with a steep spectrum for b3  1702 + 457 @xcite .",
    "hence , our negative detections with a limited sensitivity at 22  ghz are genuine even for these sources relatively strong at 1.4  ghz .",
    "consequently , the systematic study by our vlbi detection survey has revealed that nls1s are one of agn subclasses that can possess compact radio components with high brightness temperatures ( @xmath33  kelvin ) even at the high frequency ( 22  ghz ) .",
    "these compact components show inverted spectra in almost all the vlbi - detected cases , which account for a significant fraction in our radio - selected nls1 sample .",
    "these properties may be related to nls1s blazer - like aspects such as gamma - ray detections in several nls1s in contrast to normal broad - line seyfert galaxies .",
