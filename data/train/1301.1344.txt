    "the coherent drive is applied uniformly ; its effects and that of the associated loss can be described by the non - hermitian term @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the coupling rate to the resonators , @xmath17 is the amplitude and @xmath18 the frequency of the drive field . in the rotating frame of the pump field ,",
    "the effective hamiltonian of the driven system is : @xmath19 where the pump detuning @xmath20 takes the form of a chemical potential .",
    "since the system is open , in the absence of the pump ( @xmath21 ) , the system will be in the vacuum state .",
    "we generalize the quantum - jump picture for evaluating the correlation functions @xcite to many - photons and many - modes .",
    "the evolution of the system is governed by the effective hamiltonian ( eq.[eq : eff_ham ] ) and the corresponding quantum jump operators ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "in particular , in the weakly excited system ( @xmath23 ) , the metastable state of the system can be perturbatively written as : @xmath24 where @xmath25 represents a state in the @xmath26-photon manifold of the lattice system .",
    "this state is the eigenstate of @xmath27 with the smallest imaginary eigenvalues , i.e. it is mostly the vacuum state .",
    "all other states have at least one photon , and therefore , they decay rapidly into this state .",
    "when a photon decays from any site , the system undergoes a quantum jump .",
    "these jumps occur at a rate @xmath28 , and the system takes a state of the form : @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , the system can undergo a two - photon jump with a slower rate @xmath30 .",
    "since the system is continuously pumped , it is restored back into the steady state with a relatively fast rate ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "therefore , the density matrix of the system can be formally written as : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 stands for the density matrix after `` j '' consecutive jumps .",

    ", this correlation function can be perturbatively written in powers of pump amplitude : @xmath36 therefore , if we are interested in the @xmath26-photon manifold , the metastable state @xmath37 is sufficient for evaluation of any n - body correlation function and the corrections due to quantum jumps can be ignored .    in particular , for a two - particle case",
    ", we define the two - body observables to characterize the deviation from the classical regime . for a single resonator this deviation",
    "is characterized by the equal time second - order correlation function as @xmath38 .",
    "this quantity is useful in characterization of cavity qed experiments .",

    "in particular , in the presence of strong interaction @xmath39 , such a quantity is always less than one regardless of the collective features of the entire system .",
    "instead , we consider a collective observable which is the second - order correlation function of the common - mode @xmath40 : @xmath41 this observable is particularly interesting since we are exciting all the resonators the same way , and therefore , this mode is primarily excited .",

    "using the technique described above , we study the driven system of interacting photons with the hamiltonian of eq.([eq : hamiltonian_system ] ) .",

    "note the frequency required to be resonant with the laughlin state is at the vicinity of the free photon state ( hofstadter s spectrum ) . in the limit of large system @xmath48 , and dilute magnetic field @xmath49 , these two frequencies coincide since the laughlin state is the exact ground state of the hamiltonian in the continuum limit . for numerical simulations ,",
    "we have used the discrete version of the laughlin wave function on the lattice with torus boundary condition @xcite .    around the resonance , we observe the suppression of the correlation function of the common - mode .",
    "the reason behind this suppression is that the external pump is coupled differently to the single particle manifold and @xmath3-photon manifold , corresponding to the laughlin filing factor .",
    "we note that the energy of the single particle state and the laughlin state per particle is exactly equal to each other in the continuum limit , and the previously reported discrepancy is due to the finite size effect @xcite .",

    "in contrast , to the previous works @xcite , we focus in the weakly driven regime , and therefore , we expect that the system to be in the superfluid state and the correlation function to be equal to one . this deviation is due to the finite size of the system and can be understood in the following way : the system is weakly driven and manifolds with large number of photons are weakly populated .",
    "therefore , the effective filling factor @xmath61 is small and in the presence of a non - zero interaction , one expects the system to be in a superfluid regime .",
    "however , due to finite size of the system , the common - mode is not completely harmonic and the two - photon resonance is slightly shifted .",
    "this leads to a deviation of the correlation function from unity ; using the single - mode approximation , we get an estimate @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the nonlinear shift , i. e. , the difference between half of the two - photon state energy and the single - photon state energy . such nonlinearity decrease with the system size , in direct analogy to spin - boson transformation ( holsteinprimakoff ) of the dicke - model , where the residual nonlinearity disappears in the limit of large spins .",

    "note that in the general case of @xmath26-photon fqh state , one should measure @xmath26-body correlation function @xmath35 , as introduced earlier .",
    "such correlation function can be measured using a modified hanbury brown - twiss setup @xcite : the photonic mode @xmath34 is collected , the light passes through @xmath26 beam splitters and then the state is detected using @xmath26 photodetectors .",
