    "the interpretation of the emission lines of molecules in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is often complicated by the effects of re - absorption and scattering , owing to significant optical depths in the lines .",
    "partly for this reason , observations of less abundant isotopologues are analyzed , in addition or in preference to those of the principal species ; this is the case of co , for example , where @xmath0co and c@xmath10o lines are used , and also of cn , where @xmath0cn and c@xmath11n serve a similar purpose . in the present paper ,",
    "we consider the emission lines of @xmath0cn , observed at millimetre wavelengths in pre - protostellar sources .",
    "@xmath0cn has a rich spectrum at mm - wavelengths , where it displays the effects of the fine structure interaction , between the electron spin and the nuclear rotation , and of the hyperfine interaction with the spins of the @xmath0c ( @xmath12 ) and n ( @xmath13 ) nuclei .",
    "thus , bogey et al .",
    "( 1984 ) listed 16 ` allowed ' transitions , in the vicinity of 100  ghz , between the rotational states @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and a further 25 transitions at 200  ghz between the @xmath15 and @xmath16 states .",
    "it is this cornucopia of optically thin transitions that one wishes to exploit , in order to obtain a better understanding of the conditions in pre - protostellar objects .",
    "it is generally assumed that the hyperfine levels , @xmath7 , of a given @xmath17 are populated in proportion to their statistical weights , @xmath8 , i.e. that they are in local thermodynamic equilibrium lte . however , lte is the exception , rather than the rule , in the ism , because very low densities prevail .",
    "the assumption of lte is usually dictated by a lack of rate coefficients for collisional population transfer between the hyperfine levels of the molecule . in the case of @xmath0cn ( and of c@xmath11n ) , this situation has been rectified recently by the calculations of flower & lique ( 2015 ) , which provide rate coefficients for collisions with para - h@xmath4 in its rotational ground state  the dominant perturber at low kinetic temperatures , @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the opportunity arises to calculate the hyperfine level populations explicitly , allowing for collisional and radiative transfer , where the latter is induced by the cosmic microwave background or by the emission of dust present in the medium .",
    "we present the details of the calculations in section  [ calc ] and the numerical results and their implications in the following section  [ results ] .",
    "our concluding remarks are in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "bogey et al . ( 1984 ) note that the rotational ( @xmath17 ) and the hyperfine ( @xmath7 ) are the ` good ' quantum numbers of @xmath0cn .",
    "accordingly , we evaluate the relative populations , in equilibrium , of the levels ( @xmath19 ) , for a wide range of values of the density of molecular hydrogen ( specifically , para - h@xmath4 ) , @xmath3(h@xmath4 ) @xmath5  @xmath6 , and a range of kinetic temperatures , @xmath2  k. collisional and radiative population transfer are taken into account , as described below .",
    "we use the rate coefficients for collisions between @xmath0cn and para - h@xmath4 that were calculated by flower & lique ( 2015 ) , who used the angular momentum coupling scheme @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , where @xmath17 is the rotational quantum number , @xmath23 is the net electron spin , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the net spin quantum numbers of the @xmath0c and n nuclei , respectively , and @xmath7 is the hyperfine quantum number .",
    "their calculations were performed separately for the cases of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , as the value of the total nuclear spin , @xmath26 , is conserved during the collision . for a given value of @xmath26 ,",
    "the rate ( s@xmath27 ) of collisional transfer of population from the state ( @xmath28 ) to the state ( @xmath29 ) is @xmath30(h@xmath4)@xmath31 , and hence the total rate of transfer from level ( @xmath19 ) to level ( @xmath32 ) is @xmath30(h@xmath4)@xmath33 , where @xmath34 denotes a rate coefficient ( @xmath35  s@xmath27 ) and @xmath30(h@xmath4 ) is the density ( @xmath6 ) of ground state para - h@xmath4 .",
    "we assume that the nuclear spin states @xmath24 and @xmath25 are statistically populated and evaluate the rate coefficients as    @xmath36    @xmath37    varying the relative populations of the nuclear spin states had no significant effect on the results of the calculations reported in section  [ results ] below .",
    "following the analysis of optically allowed transitions by nicholls & stewart ( 1962 ) , the rate ( s@xmath27 ) of spontaneous radiative transitions between states @xmath38 and @xmath39 , belonging to levels @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , with energies @xmath42 , is given by    @xmath43    where the line strength    @xmath44    and where @xmath45  debye ( cf .",
    "hily - blant et al .",
    "2013 ) is the electric dipole moment of the molecule in its vibrational ground state .",
    "the algebraic quantities @xmath46 were computed by bogey et al .",
    "( 1984 , table  3 ) for dipole transitions within the @xmath47 and @xmath48 rotational manifolds .",
    "we note that    @xmath49    in the present context , the levels @xmath50 are identified by the quantum numbers ( @xmath19 ) , and the states @xmath51 by ( @xmath52 ) , where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the angular momentum coupling scheme adopted by bogey et al .",
    "the @xmath56-values for transitions between pairs of these states are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "the accuracy of these results is determined principally by the accuracy of the dipole moment , which is difficult to assess from the available data ( http://cccbdb.nist.gov/dipole2.asp ) .",
    "the rates ( s@xmath27 ) of spontaneous transitions between levels ( @xmath19 ) were obtained by implementing the summation relation  ( [ equ4 ] ) above .    according to the einstein relations , the rates of radiative excitation and de - excitation by a radiation field of energy density @xmath57 ( erg  @xmath6 ) at frequency @xmath58 are @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , where    @xmath61    and @xmath62 is the statistical weight . we adopt a black  body radiation field ,    @xmath63    where @xmath64  k is the temperature of the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) or of a black  body radiation field produced by local dust , mixed with the gas .      knowing the total rates ,    @xmath65    of collisional and radiative population transfer between levels ( @xmath19 ) , the populations , @xmath66 , of the 12 levels with rotational quantum numbers @xmath1 may be obtained by solving the rate equations    @xmath67    together with the closure relation    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the number density of @xmath0cn molecules . in steady  state , @xmath70 , and the relative level populations are readily obtained by matrix inversion , setting @xmath71 .",
    "then , the relative line emission ( erg  s@xmath27 ) is given by    @xmath72    where , we recall , @xmath39 and @xmath38 are states ( @xmath52 ) belonging to the levels @xmath41 and @xmath40 , identified by the quantum numbers ( @xmath19 ) ; @xmath73 is the line frequency .",
