    "recently , quantum communication has been investigated among many groups as a future technology .",
    "similar to conventional information technology , practical quantum communication technology will require distributed information processing among two or more spatially separated parties . in order to treat this problem ,",
    "it is necessary to clarify what kind of information processing is possible under respective constraints for permitted operations . in the quantum case ,",
    "when our quantum system consists of distinct two parties @xmath0 and @xmath1 , we often restrict our operations to local ( quantum ) operations and classical communications ( locc ) because sending quantum states over long distance is technologically more difficult than sending classical information@xcite . even in this restriction",
    ", we can consider the following two formulations ; ( i ) the classical communication is restricted to the direction @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( we can similarly treat the restriction of the opposite direction . )",
    "( ii ) all parties are allowed to communicate classically with each other as much as they like .",
    "the case ( i ) is called the one - way locc , and the case ( ii ) is called the two - way locc .",
    "since , by definition , the two - way locc apparently includes the one - way locc , the two - way locc is always more powerful than the one - way locc in principle .",
    "however , due to the following two reasons , it is not easy to characterize the difference between the both performances . as the first reason , it is mathematically hard to rigorously evaluate the performance of a given two - way locc protocol , because the mathematical description of two - way locc is too complicated . as the second reason , for several simple tasks ,",
    "the performance of the two - way locc was actually shown to be the same as the performance of the one - way locc .",
    "in fact , there are several settings that has no difference between one - way locc and two - way locc , e.g. , locc convertibility of bipartite pure state @xcite , stein s lemma bound in the simple asymptotic hypothesis testing of the @xmath2-tensor product of identical states@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in several settings , the two - way locc is strictly powerful than the one - way locc .",
    "for example , the distillable entanglement ( the amount of maximally entangled states which can be derived from a given state by locc ) with two - way classical communication is proven to be greater than that with one - way classical communication@xcite .",
    "also , this type comparison also has been done by several papers@xcite only on the discrimination among orthogonal states .",
    "although several researchers treated this problem , they did not treated the discrimination among non - orthogonal states . in this paper",
    ", we compare the both performances quantitatively on the `` _ local discrimination _ '' among states that are not necessarily orthogonal , whose purpose is discriminating given states by only locc with the _ single _ copy .",
    "in fact , general discrimination problem is closely related to sending classical information via quantum channel@xcite and quantum algorithm @xcite .    in order to quantify the difference of the two - way locc and the one - way locc , in this paper ,",
    "we concentrate on a simple setting : the local discrimination of the first state @xmath3 on a bipartite system @xmath4 from the second state @xmath5 under the condition where the first state @xmath3 should be detected perfectly .",
    "when the both states @xmath3 and @xmath5 are pure , there is no difference between one - way locc and two - way locc because any global discrimination protocol can be simulated by one - way locc@xcite .",
    "surprisingly , as our result , we found that there usually exists non - negligible difference between two restrictions when the second @xmath5 is the completely mixed state @xmath6 . at the first glance , this setting seems specific , however , due to the following six reasons , it is closely related to several research topics .",
    "first , this type analysis produces a bound of the number of perfectly locally distinguishable states .",
    "second , as is explained later , there is a relation between the performance of local distinguishability and amount of entanglement in the case of pure states .",
    "third , this kind of distinguishability is often treated in quantum complexity as triviality of coset state @xcite .",
    "fourth , when the second state @xmath5 is close to the completely mixed state @xmath7 , we obtain a similar conclusion because the power of our test is continuous concerning the second state .",
    "fifth , in the community of classical statistics , the problem of discriminating the given two distributions is widely accepted as the fundamental problem of hypothesis testing because general hypothesis testing problem can be treated by using this type problem@xcite .",
    "sixth , as was mentioned in the preceding papers @xcite , hypothesis testing with two candidates states is closely related to quantum channel coding .",
    "hence , it is suitable to treat this kind of local discrimination problem .    in order to analyze this problem in the respective settings ,",
    "we introduce the minimum error probabilities to detect the complete mixed state @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 by the one - way locc , the two - way locc , and the separable operations , respectively .",
    "indeed , these functions are considered as appropriate measures of the local distinguishability because they give not only the minimum error probability of the above problem , but also the upper bound of the size of locally distinguishable sets in general perfect local discrimination problems@xcite . under this formulation ,",
    "we first analyze the local distinguishability by means of one - way locc and separable operations , and derive the optimal discrimination protocol with one - way locc and separable operations ; we should note that the minimum error probability @xmath10 with separable operations gives a lower bound for the minimum error probability @xmath9 with two - way locc .",
    "after that , constructing a concrete two - way local discrimination protocol , we show that two - way classical communication remarkably improves the local distinguishability in comparison with the local discrimination by one - way classical communication at least for a low-(less than five ) dimensional bipartite pure state . indeed ,",
    "since the power of our test is continuous concerning the first and the second states , our result indicates that two - way classical communication remarkably improves the local distinguishability in a wider class of the first and the second states .",
    "moreover , as a byproduct , we extend the characterization of locally distinguishability by one - way locc by cohen @xcite to a set of mixed states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ preliminary ] , we introduce the discrimination problem between an arbitrary given state @xmath3 and a completely mixed state @xmath7 on a bipartite system @xmath4 under the condition that the given state is detected perfectly . then , we explain another meaning of @xmath8 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 from the viewpoint of general local discrimination problems . in section [ separable section chap.3 ] , constructing the optimal separable povm for the local discrimination , we prove that @xmath12 coincides with the entanglement monotone called robustness of the entanglement for a bipartite pure state , where @xmath13 is the dimension of the bipartite hilbert space @xmath4 . in section [ bipartite ] ,",
    "we show that the amount @xmath14 with one - way locc coincides with the schmidt rank ( the rank of the reduced density matrix ) of the states .",
    "also , as a corollary , we extend cohen s characterization to a set of mixed states . finally , in section [ two - way ] , constructing a concrete three - step two - way locc discrimination protocol , we derive an upper bound for @xmath15 . calculating this upper bound analytically and also numerically ,",
    "we show that @xmath16 is strictly smaller than @xmath17 , and moreover , @xmath18 and @xmath19 give almost the same value for a lower dimensional bipartite pure state ; this results can be seen in * figures 2,3,4,5,6*. as a result , we conclude that the two - way classical communication remarkably improves the local distinguishability in comparison with the one - way classical communication for a low - dimensional pure state at least in the present problem settings .",
    "in this paper , we treat the bipartite system @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) composed of two finite - dimensional subsystems @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the following sections , we often focus on the case when @xmath3 is pure . in such a case ,",
    "we assume that the dimension @xmath24 of @xmath22 is equal to that of @xmath23 .",
    "note that the given pure state belongs to the composite system of the same - dimensional subsystem .",
    "then , the dimension ( @xmath13 ) of the hilbert space @xmath4 is equal to @xmath25 . in the composite system @xmath4",
    ", we call a positive operator @xmath26 with @xmath27 a one - way locc povm element , where @xmath28 is an identity operator on @xmath4 , if the two - valued povm @xmath29 can be implemented by the one - way locc ; we also define a two - way locc povm element and a separable povm element in the same manner by using the two - way locc and the separable operations in stead of the one - way locc , respectively @xcite .",
    "we write a set of one - way locc , two - way locc , separable povm elements , and all ( global ) povm elements as @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "obviously , they satisfy the relation @xmath34 .",
    "we can see that the condition @xmath35 is equivalent with the condition @xmath36 , where @xmath37 can be either @xmath38 , or @xmath39 .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the comparison of the performance of the local discrimination in the case of the one - way locc , the two - way locc , and the separable operations . in order to find this difference , although there are many problem settings for the local discrimination , we especially focus on one of the simplest problem settings as follows : we consider local discrimination of an given arbitrary state @xmath40 and another state @xmath5 , and investigate how well we can detect @xmath5 under the additional condition that we do not make any error to detect @xmath41 when the second state @xmath5 is the completely mixed state @xmath42 @xmath43 ; namely , by only locc , how well we can distinguish a given entangled state @xmath3 from the white noise state @xmath7 without making any error to judge the given state is @xmath44 when the real state is @xmath3 .",
    "our problem can be written down rigorously as follows .",
    "we measure an unknown state chosen from two candidates @xmath45 by the two - values povm @xmath46 , where @xmath47 ; that is , if we get the result corresponding to @xmath26 , then we decide that the unknown state is in @xmath3 , and if we get the result corresponding to @xmath48 , then we decide that the unknown state is in @xmath5 .",
    "we consider two kinds of error probability as follows : the type 1 error probability @xmath49 , and the type 2 error probability @xmath50 ; these are common terms in the field of `` _ quantum hypothesis testing _ '' @xcite , where these two different error probabilities are treated in an asymmetric way . in this case , the type 1 error probability corresponds to the error probability that the real state is @xmath3 and our decision is @xmath5 , and the type 2 error probability corresponds to the error probability that the real state is @xmath5 and our decision is @xmath3 .",
    "thus , our problem is to minimize the type 2 error probability @xmath50 under the additional condition that the type 1 error probability @xmath51 must be @xmath52 .",
    "thus , we focus on the following minimum of the type 2 error probability : @xmath53 where @xmath54(one - way locc ) , @xmath55(two - way locc ) , @xmath56(separable operations ) , and @xmath39(global operations ) . when the both states @xmath3 and @xmath5 are pure states @xmath57 and @xmath58 , this quantity does not depend on whether @xmath59 , and is calculated as @xmath60 for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath39 .",
    "this is because any discriminating protocol between two pure bipartite states can be simulated by one - way locc when we focus only on the distribution of the outcome@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the minimum of the type 2 error probability in the case of @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is defined as @xmath64 and @xmath13 is the dimension of the whole system @xmath4 .",
    "that is , @xmath65 is in proportion to the minimum of the type 2 error probability @xmath66 of one - way locc , two - way locc , separable povm and global povm in the case where @xmath67 , @xmath56 , and @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "trivially , @xmath68 obviously , @xmath65 satisfies the inequality @xmath69 ; as a matter of course , @xmath70 also satisfies the similar inequality .",
    "note that by normalizing @xmath66 as the above eq.([normalization ] ) , the resulting function @xmath71 is no more a function depending both on @xmath3 and @xmath72 , but a function depending only on @xmath3 .    in quantum information community , many papers treats the bayesian framework , in which the bayesian prior distribution is assumed @xcite .",
    "however , in statistics community , non - bayesian framework is more widely accepted , in which no bayesian prior distribution is assumed@xcite .",
    "this is because it is usually quite difficult to decide the bayesian prior distribution based on the prior knowledge . in order to resolve this difficulty",
    ", they often treat the two kinds of error probabilities in an asymmetric way in hypothesis testing without assuming prior distribution because the importance of both error are not equal in a usual case , e.g. , neyman - pearson lemma@xcite , stein s lemma@xcite , hoeffding bound@xcite .",
    "these quantum cases are treated by several papers@xcite . in this paper , according to conventional statistics framework , we focus on the error probabilities of the first and second , and minimize the second kind of error probability under the constraint for the first one .    here , we explain the reason why we choose the above special problem of discrimination of an arbitrary state @xmath3 from the completely mixed state @xmath7 , and the reason why we add the above additional condition of perfect detection of @xmath3 . as we already said before",
    ", the first reason is that this additional condition makes the analysis of the problem extremely easier .",
    "actually as we will see later in this paper , we can derive the optimal povm of this restricted local - discrimination problem with respect to each one - way locc and separable operations for a bipartite pure state . as a result",
    ", we make the difference between one - way locc and two - way locc clear for our local - discrimination problem ; this is our main purpose in this paper .",
    "note that it is generally a hard problem to find an optimal protocol for a local - discrimination problem , and only in very limited situations , optimal local - discrimination protocols are known @xcite .",
    "the second reason is that we can clearly see the relationship between local distinguishability and entanglement of a state in this problem setting . in the previous paper @xcite",
    ", we showed the relationship between local distinguishability of a set of states and an average of the values of entanglement monotones for the states in terms of inequalities .",
    "however , in this paper , we will show that the minimum error probability @xmath70 of our problem is proportion to entanglement monotones in the case of one - way locc ( @xmath73 ) and separable operations ( @xmath74 ) at least for bipartite pure states except an unimportant constant factor .",
    "the third reason is that the minimum error probability @xmath70 can give a bound of local distinguishability for a more general local discrimination problem : suppose that a set of states @xmath75 is perfectly locally distinguishable by one - way locc ( @xmath73 ) , two - way locc ( @xmath76 ) , or separable ( @xmath77 ) povm . from the result",
    "obtain in the the previous paper , @xmath78 ( which corresponds to @xmath79 ) gives an upper bound of @xmath80 as @xcite , @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the average of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath86 can be considered as an appropriate measure of local distinguishability in a original operational sense , and also as a function whose average gives an upper bound for the locally distinguishable sets of states .",
    "therefore , we investigate the difference of local distinguishability of @xmath41 by one - way locc povm , two - way locc povm , and separable povm in terms of @xmath87 in the following sections .",
    "in this section , we investigate the minimum type 2 error probability @xmath88 in terms of separable povms , which are given by @xmath89 with the conditions @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "the main purpose of this section is proving the following theorem :    [ thm2 ] the inequality @xmath93 holds for a bipartite state @xmath3 on @xmath94 , where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are the reduced density matrix of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "any pure state satisfies its equality . in other words , the following inequality concerning the minimum error probability",
    "@xmath97 holds : @xmath98    for a bipartite pure state , the right - hand side of eq.([ineq-2 ] ) is proportional to an entanglement monotone called the global robustness of entanglement @xmath99 except an unimportant constant term @xcite .",
    "applying theorem [ thm2 ] for eq.([local dicrimination bound ] ) , we can immediately derive the following corollary concerning the perfect discrimination of a given set of states in term of separable operations :    if a set of states @xmath100 is perfectly distinguishable by separable operations , then , the set of states @xmath100 satisfies the following inequality : @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the average of @xmath103 for all @xmath104 .",
    "the above inequality is weaker than the inequality ( [ local dicrimination bound ] ) .",
    "however , the inequality ( [ ineq - owari ] ) is superior to the inequality ( [ local dicrimination bound ] ) in terms of the efficiency of the computation ; that is , in general , we can not efficiently compute the bound in eq.([local dicrimination bound ] ) , since the function @xmath105 includes the big variational problem .",
    "first , for a technical reason , we concentrate the pure states case , and define a set of povm elements @xmath106 by , @xmath107 @xmath108 is a set of povm elements can be decomposed into a separable form ; we say a positive linear operator @xmath109 has a separable form , if @xmath110 is a separable state .",
    "since the definition of @xmath111 is equivalent to the definition of @xmath112 except the condition @xmath113 , @xmath112 is a subset of @xmath114 . note that even if @xmath115 , @xmath48 does not necessary satisfy @xmath116 ; that is",
    ", @xmath112 does not coincide with @xmath114 .",
    "for example , suppose a set of states @xmath117",
    "( @xmath118 ) is an unextendable product basis , and a povm @xmath26 is defined as @xmath119 .",
    "then , @xmath26 belongs to @xmath114 , but not to @xmath112 since @xmath120 is proportion to a ( bound ) entangled state , and does not a separable form @xcite .",
    "similarly , we can define @xmath121 as , @xmath122    by definition , @xmath123 apparently gives a lower bound of @xmath124 , that is , for all @xmath125 , @xmath126 then , we can see that @xmath127 is actually equal to @xmath128 which is defined in theorem 1 of the paper @xcite as : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the set of all separable states .",
    "we can easily check this fact just by defining @xmath131 ; then , @xmath26 satisfies @xmath27 , @xmath132 , and @xmath115 . from theorem 2 of the paper @xcite , for an arbitrary multipartite pure state @xmath133 , @xmath134 satisfies the following inequality : @xmath135 and @xmath99 is the global robustness of entanglement @xcite defined as : @xmath136    for a bipartite pure state , we can know a more detail of @xmath137 as follows .",
    "first , it was proven that @xmath137 coincides with the robustness of entanglement @xmath138 for an arbitrary pure bipartite state @xmath133 @xcite .",
    "this fact can be seen by checking that the optimal states of @xmath139 , which was derived in @xcite satisfies the condition of @xmath128 ; the optimal state of @xmath139 is also an optimal state of @xmath140 .",
    "moreover , we know that the value of @xmath99 is given by the following formula for a bipartite state @xmath133 @xcite : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the schmidt coefficients of @xmath133 ; @xmath133 can be decomposed as @xmath143 by choosing an appropriate orthonormal basis sets of the local hilbert spaces @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "thus , we derive    [ lemma for bipartite t_widetilde ] for a bipartite pure state @xmath146 , @xmath147    although this lemma is a known result @xcite , as a preparation of the proof of the next theorem , we give a complete proof of eq.([bipartite t_widetilde ] ) , in which we prove directly the equation @xmath148 from the definition of @xmath137 .",
    "this proof is divided into two - steps . in the first step , we prove that @xmath149 is the lower bound of @xmath150",
    ". then , in the second step , we construct povm element @xmath26 which attains this lower bound . for convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the schmidt basis of @xmath133 ; thus , @xmath154 is the maximum entangled state sharing the schmidt basis with @xmath133 .",
    "then , we derive @xmath155 .    as the first step , we prove the following inequality ; @xmath156 to prove the first inequality ( [ 1stineq ] ) , since both @xmath157 and @xmath158 are linear for @xmath26 , it is enough to prove only in the case that @xmath26 can be written down as @xmath159 by using un - normalized vectors @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "suppose @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "then , using schwarz s inequality , we can prove as follows @xmath164 for the second inequality ( [ 2ndineq ] ) , since the relations @xmath165 and @xmath166 deduce that @xmath133 is an eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue @xmath167 of @xmath26 , we derive @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , the inequality @xmath169 is derived by taking the mean value with respect to @xmath154 .    as the second step , we construct an example of povm element @xmath26 which achieves the lower bound we derived above .",
    "define @xmath170 as @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 ; then , @xmath170 satisfies @xmath174 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath175 where @xmath176 , @xmath170 satisfies @xmath177 .",
    "since @xmath170 apparently satisfies @xmath178 , the inequality @xmath166 is the only remaining condition which the optimal povm element @xmath26 attaining the equality @xmath179 must satisfy . since @xmath170 does not generally satisfies the inequality @xmath180 , we construct a new povm element @xmath26 which satisfies @xmath27 from @xmath170 . in order to construct the povm element @xmath26 from @xmath170",
    ", we use twirling technique here .",
    "we define a family of local unitary operators @xmath181 parameterized by @xmath182 as follows , @xmath183 note that @xmath184 is a unitary representation of the compact topological group @xmath185 ; by means of a unitary representation of a compact topological group , we implement the `` _ twirling _ '' operation ( the averaging over the compact topological group ) for a state ( or povm ) @xcite .",
    "then , we define @xmath26 as the operator which is constructed by twirling @xmath186 over parameters @xmath187 . since by an action of twirling operation",

    "since we have already proven the converse inequality , we conclude @xmath194 + @xmath195    finally , by means of lemma [ lemma for bipartite t_widetilde ] , we can derive the following theorem , i.e. , theorem [ thm2 ] in the pure states case :    [ theorem separable main ] for a bipartite pure state @xmath133 , @xmath196 where @xmath142 is the schmidt coefficients of @xmath133 .",
    "since by the definition @xmath197 , all what we need to prove is that the optimal povm @xmath26 for @xmath137 is also the optimal povm for @xmath198 ; that is , @xmath199 also has a separable form .    as we have already shown in the proof of lemma [ lemma for bipartite t_widetilde ] , the optimal povm @xmath26 for @xmath137",

    ", we can extend cohen s characterization @xcite concerning the perfect discrimination of a given set of pure states in term of one - way locc to a set of mixed states :    if a set of bipartite states @xmath100 on @xmath94 is perfectly distinguishable by one - way locc , then , @xmath255    this bound of the size of locally distinguishable sets for one - way locc is much stronger than the known bound for separable operations @xcite .    as a preparation for our proof of theorem [ theorem one - way main ] , we see the fact that there are several equivalent representations of the definition of one - way locc povm elements . we start from the following representation which we can see immediately from the definition ; that is , in a bipartite system @xmath256 , if @xmath257 , there exist sets of positive operators @xmath258 and @xmath259 such that @xmath260 @xmath261 , and @xmath262 , where @xmath263 is the povm of the local measurement on @xmath22 and @xmath264 is the povm of the local measurement on @xmath23 depending on the first measurement result @xmath265 .",

    "the opposite direction is trivial .",
    "@xmath195    now , we prove theorem [ theorem one - way main ] using the above lemma .    in order to detect a state perfectly , we need to detect the reduced density operator of the local system @xmath0 , @xmath281 as well as that of the other local system @xmath1 , @xmath282 , perfectly in each step .",

    "thus , we concentrate ourselves on driving an upper - bound of @xmath295 by constructing a concrete two - way locc discrimination protocol . for simplicity , we only treat three - step locc discrimination protocols on a bipartite system , which are in the simplest class of genuine two - way locc protocols . as a result , we show that even three - step locc protocols can discriminates a given state from the completely mixed state much better than by one - way ( that is , two - step ) locc protocols .",
    "we can generally describe a three - step locc protocol to discriminate a pure state @xmath296 from @xmath297 on a bipartite system @xmath94 without making any error to detect @xmath296 as follow : suppose there are two parties called alice and bob . first , alice performs a povm @xmath298 on her system @xmath22 , and sends the measurement result @xmath265 to bob .",

    "then , if she detects @xmath307 , she judges that the first state was @xmath296 , and if she detects @xmath308 , she judges that the first state was @xmath44 .",
    "suppose @xmath309 is the povm corresponds to the above local discrimination protocol , where @xmath26 corresponds to @xmath296 , and @xmath310 corresponds to @xmath44 then , we can check that the whole povm @xmath46 can be written down as follows , @xmath311 where @xmath305 is defined by eq.([definition of sigma _ a ] ) , and all @xmath312 and @xmath313 are positive operators satisfying @xmath314 and @xmath315 .",
    "we can also check that @xmath26 defined by eq.([definition of two - way t ] ) satisfies @xmath316 as follows : @xmath317 where @xmath318 is the maximally entangled state sharing the schmidt basis with @xmath133 , and the transposition @xmath26 is always taken in the schmidt basis of @xmath296 . in the second line of the above equalities , we used the equality @xmath319 . in the third line",

    ", our aim is only to find a good ( not necessary optimal ) two - way locc protocol by which we can discriminate a state from the completely mixed state better than by any one - way locc protocols .",
    "thus , to make a problem simpler , we make the following assumptions on alice s povm @xmath298 and bob s povm @xmath322 : first , without losing any generality , we can write @xmath296 as @xmath323 with @xmath324 and @xmath325 , where @xmath326 is an arbitrary fixing computational basis of @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and @xmath327 ; since our definition of @xmath328 ( eq.([definition of t_c ] ) ) does not depend on the dimension of the whole system , we can always choose the whole system in order that the schmidt rank of @xmath133 is @xmath24 .",
    "second , we assume that the number of povm element @xmath329 is @xmath330 , and @xmath329 is diagonalizable in the computational basis @xmath326 as , @xmath331 where @xmath332 , and the coefficients @xmath333 satisfy @xmath334 for all @xmath252 . moreover , we assume that @xmath322 is a von neumann measurement corresponding to a mutually unbiased basis @xcite @xmath335 of an orthonormal set of eigen vectors of @xmath336 corresponding to non - zero eigenvalues ; that is , @xmath337 only spans @xmath338 . in other words , an orthonormal set of states @xmath335 satisfies @xmath339 note that @xmath340 is the bob s state after the alice s first measurement in the case where the given state is @xmath133 , and thus , bob only needs to detect the subspace @xmath341 in this case .",
    "that is , bob s povm consists of @xmath342 and @xmath343 ; if bob derives the measurement result corresponding to @xmath343 , then , he judges that the given state is @xmath44 .",
    "we also should note that due to this bob s mutually unbiased measurement , our three - step protocol can not be reduced to a two - step one - way locc protocol . if all bob s povms are commutative with the eigen basis of @xmath344 , the whole protocol can be reduced to a one - way locc protocol ; however , @xmath344 never commutes the projection onto the mutually unbiased basis of the eigen basis of @xmath344 .",
    "finally , under the above assumptions , we can write down the trace of the whole povm element @xmath157 as follows , @xmath345 in the second line of the above equalities , we used eq.([definition of sigma _ a ] ) ( the definition of @xmath305 ) and the equality @xmath346 . in the fourth line of the above equalities",
