    "invariant manifolds and their intersections are important features that organize qualitative properties of dynamical systems .",
    "three types of manifolds have been prominent in the subject : ( 1 ) compact invariant tori  @xcite , ( 2 ) stable and unstable manifolds of equilibria and periodic orbits  @xcite , and ( 3 ) slow manifolds of multiple time scale systems  @xcite .",
    "interval arithmetic and verified computing have been used extensively to give rigorous estimates and existence proofs for invariant tori and occasionally to locate stable and unstable manifolds , but this paper is the first to employ these methods to locate slow manifolds .",
    "each of these three cases pose numerical challenges to locate the manifolds .",
    "many methods that locate invariant tori assume that the flow on the tori is smoothly conjugate to a constant flow with dense orbits .",
    "existence of this conjugacy confronts well known small divisor problems and the winding vector of the flow must satisfy diophantine conditions in order for this problem to be solvable .",
    "typically , the numerical methods produce a fourier expansion of the conjugacy which is determined up to a translation .",
    "the manifolds are located by projection onto a discrete set of fourier modes and solving a fixed point equation for the coefficients of the conjugacy .",
    "the computation of stable and unstable manifolds of equilibria and periodic orbits is a `` one - sided '' boundary value problem .",
    "the manifolds consist of trajectories that are asymptotic to the equilibrium or periodic orbit . in the case of an equilibrium point of an analytic vector field ,",
    "the local stable and unstable manifolds are analytic graphs that have convergent asymptotic expansions whose coefficients can be determined iteratively .",
    "the most challenging aspect of computations of two dimensional manifolds arises from the way that trajectories do or do not spread out in the manifold as one departs from the equilibrium or periodic orbit .",
    "as illustrated by the lorenz manifold  @xcite , the manifolds can twist and fold in ways that present additional geometrical complications for numerical methods .",
    "the development of rigorous bounds for these invariant manifolds follows similar principles to the verified computation of individual trajectories .",
    "multiple time scale vector fields , also known as singularly perturbed differential equations , occur in many settings : systems of chemical reactions , lasers , fluid dynamics and models of the electrical activity of neurons are a few examples .",
    "borrowing terminology from fluid dynamics , the solutions of these systems can have ( boundary ) layers in which the fast time scale determines the rate at which the solution varies as well as long periods of time during which the solution evolves on the slow time scale .",
    "the slow motion typically occurs along _ slow manifolds _ that are locally invariant .",
    "the slow manifolds play a prominent role in qualitative analysis of the dynamics and bifurcations of multiple time scale systems .",
    "indeed , model reduction procedures are frequently employed that replace a model by a lower dimensional model that approximates the motion along a slow manifold and ignores the fast dynamics of the original model .",
    "the ideal for this type of model reduction is an algorithm that computes the slow manifold exactly .",
    "that ideal seems very difficult to achieve and is not addressed in this paper . instead , we seek rigorous bounds for the location of the slow manifold that are tight enough to give information that can be used in the analysis of bifurcations of the system .    to explain the methods we introduce in the simplest terms , we focus upon _ slow - fast _ systems that contain an explicit parameter @xmath0 that represents the ratio of time scales .",
    "moreover , we restrict attention to systems that have two slow variables and one fast variable and use a single example as a test case . in principle , the methods generalize to the case of codimension one slow manifolds , and the definitions and existence proofs in sections [ s_overmethod ] and [ s_existence ] have obvious higher dimensional analogues . in practice , however , due to the scarcity of tools for computational geometry in higher dimensions , implementing a higher dimensional version would be a significant extension of the work described in this paper .",
    "we comment on generalizations from the setting of systems with two slow and one fast variable in the discussion at the end of the paper , but leave consideration of further details to future work .",
    "slow manifolds of multiple time scale systems present unique theoretical and numerical challenges compared to the computation of invariant tori and ( un)stable manifolds .",
    "the first of these challenges is that theory is developed primarily in terms of `` small enough '' values of the parameter @xmath0 measuring the time scale ratio of a slow - fast system . numerically , one always works with specific values of @xmath0 .",
    "the convergence of trajectories as @xmath1 is singular , making it difficult to develop methods framed in terms of asymptotic expansions in @xmath0 .",
    "divergent series are the rule rather than the exception in this context .",
    "the rich history of numerical integration methods for stiff systems and the large literature on reduction methods for kinetic equations of chemical systems reflect the difficulty of computing attracting slow manifolds , the simplest case for this problem . computing slow manifolds of saddle - type",
    "presents the additional challenge that most nearby trajectories diverge from the slow manifold on the fast time scale in both forward and backward time .",
    "the second theoretical difficulty in finding slow manifolds is that they are only locally invariant in most problems of interest .",
    "the local invariance is accompanied by a lack of uniqueness : possible manifolds intersect fast subspaces in open sets whose diameter is exponentially small in @xmath0 ; i.e. , bounded by @xmath2 for a suitable @xmath3 . methods based upon root finding of a discretized set of equations must choose a specific solution of the discretized equations .",
    "we compute enclosures of slow manifolds by exploiting transversality properties that improve as @xmath1 while being suitable for fixed values of @xmath0 .",
    "the methods do not identify a unique object and are well suited to locating locally invariant slow manifolds . if @xmath4 is a hypersurface and",
    "@xmath5 is a vector field , then transversality of @xmath5 to @xmath4 is a _ local _ property : verification does not rely upon computation of trajectories of @xmath5 . for a slow - fast vector field with one fast variable , translation of a normally hyperbolic critical manifold along the fast direction produces a transverse hypersurface when the translation distance is large enough .",
    "translation distances proportional to @xmath0 suffice . in this paper",
    ", we use piecewise linear surfaces @xmath4 as enclosing manifolds . for the example",
    "we consider , transversality at vertices of a face of @xmath4 implies transversality of the entire face .",
    "this reduces the computational complexity of checking transversality sufficiently that iterative refinement of the enclosures was feasible .",
    "since slow manifolds are objects that are defined asymptotically in terms of the parameter @xmath0 , they are not directly computable using finite information .",
    "one part of this paper is devoted to the development of a mathematical framework within which slow manifolds are defined for fixed values of @xmath6 .",
    "we define _ computable slow manifolds _ and relate this concept to the slow manifolds studied in geometric singular perturbation theory .",
    "all computations and statements in this paper are for computable slow manifolds .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the finite resolution dynamics approach of luzzatto and pilarczyk @xcite .",
    "our work is motivated by the study of tangencies of invariant manifolds .",
    "significant global changes in the dynamics of a system have been observed to occur at bifurcations involving tangencies .",
    "proving the existence of tangencies is intrinsically complicated because the manifolds themselves must be tracked over a range of parameters .",
    "computer - aided proofs of tangencies of invariant manifolds have previously been studied by arai and mischaikow in @xcite , and wilczak and zgliczyski in @xcite . in section [ s_tang ]",
    ", we prove that a tangency bifurcation involving a computable slow manifold occurs in the singular hopf normal form introduced in @xcite .",
    "slow - fast differential equations have the form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "we assume that the vector field @xmath12 is smooth ( @xmath13 ) , although most of this paper can easily be adapted to the finitely differentiable setting . here",
    "@xmath14 and @xmath15 are the fast and slow variables , respectively . throughout the paper we consider the case @xmath16 and @xmath17 of two slow variables and one fast variable .",
    "we define the _ critical manifold _",
    ", as the set @xmath18 the critical manifold is normally hyperbolic at points where @xmath19 is hyperbolic ; i.e. , has no eigenvalue whose real part is zero .",
    "points where @xmath20 is singular are referred to as folds . on the normally hyperbolic pieces of the critical manifold , @xmath14",
    "is given as a function of @xmath15 , @xmath21 .",
    "the corresponding differential equation @xmath22 is called the slow flow .",
    "if one instead rescales time with @xmath0 and puts @xmath23 in , one gets the _ layer equation _ : @xmath24 note that the manifold @xmath20 is exactly the set of critical points for the layer equation .",
    "singular perturbation theory studies how the solutions to ( [ eq_slowfast ] ) for @xmath0 small , but positive , can be understood by studying solutions to ( [ eq_slowsystem ] ) and ( [ eq_fastsystem ] ) .",
    "when @xmath20 is normally hyperbolic and @xmath25 is sufficiently small , geometric singular perturbation theory @xcite ensures that the critical manifold perturbs to a _",
    "slow manifold_. slow manifolds are _ locally invariant _ and @xmath26 close to the critical manifold",
    ". however , slow manifolds are not unique , although different choices are within @xmath27 distance from each other .",
    "we denote slow manifolds by @xmath28.the purpose of this work is to compute approximations of @xmath28 that are guaranteed to be of a certain accuracy .",
    "this is achieved by computing two approximations that enclose the slow manifold .",
    "the two approximations of the slow manifold are triangulated surfaces transverse to the vector field .",
    "to prove the transversality , we use interval analysis , to be explained in subsection [ ss_valnum ] .",
    "interval analysis is a general technique that enables mathematically rigorous proofs of inequalities on a digital computer .    to simplify notation",
    "we denote the two slow variables by @xmath15 and @xmath29 , i.e. , from now on @xmath30 , and the vector field in the slow variables is denoted by @xmath31 .",
    "we also assume that @xmath32 and @xmath33 are independent of @xmath0 . to summarize , the systems we study are of the following form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "we will sometimes use the notation @xmath37 .",
    "_ interval analysis _ was introduced by moore in @xcite as a method to use a digital computer to produce mathematically rigorous results with only approximate arithmetic .",
    "tucker @xcite is a modern introduction to the subject , and more advanced topics are discussed by neumaier @xcite .",
    "the main idea is to replace floating point arithmetic with a set arithmetic ; the basic objects are intervals of points rather than individual points .",
    "together with directed rounding this method yields an enclosure arithmetic that allows for the rigorous verification of inequalities . to use interval analysis to produce a mathematical proof , often called _ ( auto-)validated numerical methods _",
    ", one has to prove that the statement at hand can be reduced to a finite number of inequalities , and then verify that these inequalities are satisfied .",
    "interval arithmetic is used for the verification .",
    "the objects used to describe sets in validated numerics are typically convex sets in some coordinate system , e.g. , intervals , parallelograms , or ellipsoids . in this paper we will employ triangular meshes of surfaces , an approach that previously , in this setting , only has been used in @xcite .      the study of invariant manifolds @xcite is central to the theory of dynamical systems .",
    "the behavior of a system can often be understood by understanding its invariant structures .",
    "numerical computations of invariant manifolds @xcite are important in many applications .",
    "there are no universally applicable methods to compute invariant manifolds ; to be efficient , they have to be tailored for the specific class of problems one is studying . computing invariant manifolds of slow - fast systems is particularly challenging . two existing methods",
    "are @xcite , and no rigorous methods exist .",
    "the main idea of our method is to refine a first order approximation of the manifold by local modifications that maintain transversality of the enclosing manifolds .",
    "interval arithmetic is used to make the local computation of transversality rigorous .",
    "this is similar in spirit to the methods developed in @xcite to study the phase portraits of planar polynomial vector fields . even in the planar case",
    "the verified computation of phase portraits is a challenging task , and the few methods that exist include @xcite .",
    "this section describes our method to compute enclosures of the slow manifold of a slow - fast system of the form ( [ eq_slowfast_12 ] ) .",
    "we start by giving an overview of the main ideas of the method .",
    "there are five main steps in the algorithm :    1 .",
    "triangulation of the critical manifold , 2 .   computing the @xmath26 correction term for the slow manifold , 3 .   constructing left and right perturbations of the slow manifold , 4 .   proving that the left and right perturbations enclose the manifold , and 5 .   tightening the enclosure by contracting the left and right perturbations towards each other .",
    "the first step is to compute a triangulation of the critical manifold , which is adapted to its geometry .",
    "the manifold is defined implicitly by the condition @xmath38 . in the example we consider in section [ s_method ]",
    ", we solve this equation to obtain explicit expressions for the functions of the form @xmath39 whose graphs lie in the critical manifold .",
    "alternatively , one computes approximations to @xmath40 using , e.g. , automatic differentiation and continuation procedures .",
    "there are many software packages to compute triangulations of surfaces ; we use cgal @xcite via its matlab interface .",
    "when a part of the critical manifold is represented as the graph of a function @xmath40 , its domain in the plane of the slow variables can be triangulated , and then this triangulation can be lifted to the graph , as illustrated in figure [ f_triangulation ] .",
    "so that the triangles in the lifted triangulation have similar diameters , we choose triangles in the plane of the slow variables to have diameters that depend upon the gradient of @xmath40 .",
    "we stress that the rest of the algorithm is independent from how the triangulation of the critical manifold is constructed . rather than using axis parallel patches",
    ", one could , e.g. , use approximate trajectory segments of the reduced system to determine the piece of the domain of the slow variables , where the slow manifold is computed .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    we compute an approximation to the slow manifold using a procedure similar to that employed in stiff integrators that use rosenbrock methods @xcite .",
    "the tangent space to the critical manifold is orthogonal to the vector @xmath41 . according to the fenichel theory ,",
    "the slow manifold is @xmath26 close to the critical manifold in the @xmath42 topology , so its tangent space is approximately normal to @xmath41 . at a point @xmath43 in the ( lifted ) triangulation of @xmath20",
    ", we look for a nearby point @xmath44 at which the vector field is orthogonal to @xmath45 .",
    "since @xmath46 and the normal hyperbolicity implies that @xmath47 , @xmath48 is an approximate solution to this equation . setting @xmath49 to this value",
    ", we take @xmath44 as a point of the triangulation of the approximate slow manifold .",
    "the critical manifold and the approximation to the slow manifold are illustrated in figure [ f_critslowmfd ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "we next perturb this triangulation of the approximate slow manifold in both directions parallel to the @xmath14-axis , as in figure [ f_critslowmfd ] ( c ) , by a factor @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a natural number that will be specified later . in case that @xmath49 is very small ,",
    "we replace it by a @xmath52 term .",
    "this procedure yields two surfaces that are candidates for the enclosing surfaces that we seek .",
    "\\(a ) ( b ) ( c )    to verify that the surfaces enclose the slow manifold , we check whether the flow of the full system ( [ eq_slowfast_12 ] ) is transversal to the candidate surfaces . as",
    "the candidate surfaces are piecewise linear , we have to define what we mean by transversality at the edges and vertices of the triangulation .",
    "[ d_cone ] let @xmath53 be a triangulated , piecewise linear two dimensional manifold @xmath54 .",
    "since @xmath55 is a manifold , it locally separates @xmath56 into two sides .",
    "we say that a vector @xmath57 is transverse to @xmath55 if @xmath57 and @xmath58 point to opposite sides of @xmath55 .",
    "a smooth vector field is transverse to @xmath55 if it is transverse to @xmath55 at every point of @xmath55 .",
    "figure [ f_cone](a ) illustrates this definition .",
    "trajectories of the flow generated by @xmath5 will all cross @xmath55 from one side to another if @xmath5 is transverse to @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath59 and @xmath60 are triangulated surfaces transverse to the flow with opposite crossing directions , then they form enclosing surfaces for the slow manifold we seek .",
    "\\(a ) ( b )    [ f_triangle ]    transversality is a condition that is local to each face of the triangulation , so we can check it on each face of the triangulation separately . to check the transversality condition on one face",
    ", we estimate the range of the inner product of the vector field with the normal of the face , as illustrated in figure [ f_triangle](b ) .",
    "details about the existence of locally invariant , normally hyperbolic manifolds inside the enclosure are addressed in section [ s_existence ] below .",
    "the final part of the algorithm is to iteratively update the location of the vertices by moving them towards each other in small steps along the fast direction .",
    "we check that the transversality properties still hold , see figure [ f_updatemfd ] .",
    "this tightening step is stopped when no more vertices can be moved .",
    "note that the vertices of all @xmath61 triangulations : the critical manifold , the approximate slow manifold , and the two perturbed manifolds , all have the same @xmath62 components .",
    "\\(a ) ( b ) ( c )",
    "the method outlined in the previous section constructs two triangulated surfaces , in the phase space of a slow - fast system , that are transversal to the flow for the given @xmath0 . in this section we discuss the existence of locally invariant manifolds enclosed between these two triangulations .",
    "we denote the two enclosing surfaces by @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the region enclosed between them by @xmath65 .",
    "note that @xmath63 and @xmath64 are graphs over the same compact region , so @xmath65 is well defined . specifically ,",
    "if for some compact set of slow variables @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , then @xmath69 , ( y , z)\\in d\\}$ ] .",
    "we would like to claim that there is a locally invariant manifold inside of @xmath65 which is a graph over the slow variables .",
    "we must thus verify that it is possible to choose a subset of @xmath65 which is a @xmath42 manifold , locally invariant , and whose projection onto the domain in the slow variables is bijective .",
    "we start this section by defining _",
    "computable slow manifolds _ as objects associated to a fixed @xmath0 .",
    "similar to a slow - manifold , a computable slow manifold , is not unique .",
    "informally , a computable slow manifold is a manifold close to the critical manifold where the flow is slow .",
    "we measure slowness by comparing the slopes of trajectories within our enclosure with the slope of the critical manifold .",
    "the relative slope is defined as a bound on the slope of trajectories divided by the slope of the critical manifold : @xmath70    a computable slow manifold is a @xmath42 locally invariant , normally hyperbolic manifold , of the same dimension as the critical manifold , which projects injectively along the fast variable to the critical manifold , such that the its relative slope satisfies @xmath71    note that the order of @xmath72 is @xmath73 away from the slow manifold , so the definition is consistent with the standard perturbative definition of slow manifolds @xcite .",
    "slow manifolds are widely used in studies of slow - fast systems arising from biological or chemical models .",
    "however , computable slow manifolds are often the objects that are identified in applications : a locally invariant manifold at a _ fixed _ value of epsilon that follows the critical manifold closely , and on which the flow is slow @xcite .",
    "this concept is captured by the definition of the computable slow manifold .",
    "thus , our enclosures method gives a general and robust method to compute where candidates for such manifolds might lie in the phase space .",
    "we will explain why computable slow manifolds exist within @xmath65 in the following special case , which is sufficient for the purpose of this paper .",
    "[ a_exist ] assume that :    * all trajectories of @xmath65 reach its boundary in forward and backward time . * the boundary of @xmath65 , @xmath74 is piecewise smooth .",
    "tangencies of the vector field with @xmath74 are quadratic ( i.e. , folds in the sense of singularity theory ) , and these tangencies occur along smooth curves that connect @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "* there are invariant horizontal and vertical cone fields on @xmath65 , and the vertical invariant cone field contains the fast direction of the vector field on @xmath65 .",
    "assume that the vector field is inward on @xmath63 and @xmath64 and denote by @xmath75 and @xmath76 the sets in @xmath77 where the vector field points inward and outward , respectively .",
    "choose a smooth curve , @xmath78 , in @xmath77 such that the projection of the curve to the slow variables contains the projection of @xmath79 to the slow variables , and points on the curve on @xmath76 are images of the flow of points on the curve on @xmath75 .",
    "flow this graph forward until each trajectory leaves @xmath65 .",
    "the set swept out by these trajectory segments is : @xmath80 the set @xmath28 is well - defined , as smooth as @xmath81 and the vector field , and diffeomorphic to its projection onto the critical manifold @xmath20 .",
    "inflowing trajectories of @xmath65 must exit through @xmath76 .",
    "the exit time is uniformly bounded , since @xmath65 is compact .",
    "hence , @xmath28 is well defined .",
    "the existence of invariant cone fields , with a normal vertical cone field containing the fast direction , ensures that @xmath28 is a graph over the slow variables , and thus diffeomorphic to the corresponding part of the critical manifold .",
    "the final requirement of the definition - that the relative slope is small - yields a quantitative requirement on the tightness of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "in a slow - fast system , an equilibrium point may cross a fold of the critical manifold .",
    "if it undergoes a hopf bifurcation at @xmath26 distance from the fold both in parameter and phase space , we follow @xcite and refer to this as a _ singular hopf bifurcation_. singular hopf bifurcation occurs in generic one parameter families of slow - fast systems .",
    "we use a normal form for singular hopf bifurcation in systems with one fast and two slow variables proposed by guckenheimer @xcite as an example system for the computations of slow manifolds presented in this paper .",
    "the normal form is given by @xmath82 which depends upon the four parameters @xmath83 as well as @xmath0 .",
    "an @xmath0-dependent scaling transformation eliminates @xmath0 as a parameter : set @xmath84 to obtain @xmath85    guckenheimer @xcite studies invariant manifolds in the phase space of system   at different system parameters : the branch of the critical manifold @xmath86 where @xmath87 perturbs into a repelling slow manifold , while the branch where @xmath88 perturbs into an attracting slow manifold . in large regions of parameter space ,",
    "an equilibrium that has undergone singular hopf bifurcation is a saddle - focus with a two - dimensional unstable manifold that is initially bounded by a periodic orbit . as the parameter @xmath89",
    "is varied , the unstable manifold grows and eventually intersects the repelling slow manifold , first tangentially and then transversally . in the following ,",
    "we refer to such a tangential intersection of the equilibrium s unstable manifold with the repelling slow manifold as a _",
    "tangency _ or _ tangency of invariant manifolds_. figure  [ f_shb_phase_space ] shows selected objects in the phase space of system   at a parameter just after the tangency .",
    "the tangency is a codimension 1 phenomenon .",
    "note that since slow manifolds are not unique , there is some ambiguity in what it means for a slow manifold to intersect another manifold .",
    "we will introduce a definition to deal with this in section [ s_tang ] .",
    "the tangency bifurcation is evident in the organization of phase space by invariant manifolds , as it separates regions in parameter space where trajectories in the unstable manifold of the singular hopf equilibrium have different possible limit sets : after the tangency , trajectories can escape from the fold region , whereas , before the tangency , the unstable manifold is confined to the fold region .",
    "this change is significant in many other slow - fast systems : suppose that a system with one fast and two slow variables has an s - shaped critical manifold as well as a singular hopf bifurcation followed by a tangency .",
    "the system introduced by koper @xcite is an example .",
    "figure  [ f_koper_phasespace_timeseries ] ( left pane ) shows a trajectory in koper s system just after the tangency bifurcation , together with the position of the critical manifold : the trajectory starts in the vicinity of the singular hopf equilibrium and goes through a spiraling motion until it leaves the fold region to the left .",
    "it lands close to the critical manifold on an attracting slow manifold , which it follows to a fold before `` jumping '' to another attracting slow manifold and returning along this slow manifold back to the vicinity of the singular hopf equilibrium point .",
    "the process now repeats , leading to a time series like the one shown on the right pane of figure  [ f_koper_phasespace_timeseries ] .",
    "such patterns with alternating large - amplitude and small - amplitude oscillations are known as mixed mode oscillations in the literature  @xcite .",
    "guckenheimer and meerkamp @xcite present a detailed analysis of the bifurcation structure of the singular hopf normal form .",
    "this includes extensive numerical results on the position of the tangency bifurcation in the five - dimensional parameter space of the normal form .",
    "the position of the tangency curve was computed in two ways : ( 1 ) using the numerical continuation software auto @xcite and ( 2 ) using custom matlab code . in method",
    "( 1 ) , a boundary value problem is set up to track a trajectory segment that starts on a fixed ray in the linear approximation of the unstable manifold of the singular hopf equilibrium point and follows the repelling slow manifold for a substantial period of time .",
    "the latter is achieved by requiring it to have a sufficiently long time - length and ending on the parabola @xmath90 , thus forcing the trajectory to remain very close to the repelling slow manifold nearly to the end of the trajectory segment .",
    "a tangency of invariant manifolds corresponds to a fold of a solution to this boundary value problem , i.e. , a point where two solutions approach each other and vanish together as the parameter is varied .",
    "such folds can be detected by auto in a one - parameter continuation and continued in two parameters , thus enabling detection and continuation of the tangency bifurcation .",
    "method ( 2 ) is based on the heuristic that the tangency separates regions in parameter space where trajectories in the unstable manifold escape the fold region from regions where trajectories in the unstable manifold remain in the fold region .",
    "a grid of initial conditions in an approximation of a fundamental domain of the unstable manifold is integrated numerically for a sufficiently long time .",
    "if the sample trajectories in the unstable manifold limit to an attracting periodic orbit or another bounded attractor , the parameter is before the tangency . if at least one trajectory leaves the fold region , the parameter is after the tangency .",
    "repeated applications of the above steps in an interval bisection method determine an approximate position of the tangency in parameter space .",
    "note that neither method ( 1 ) nor ( 2 ) is rigorous .",
    "in particular , neither of the two methods establishes bounds for the position of the repelling slow manifold or of the unstable manifold of the equilibrium .",
    "section  [ s_tang ] presents a rigorous method to compute a tangency .",
    "in this section we give a detailed description of our method for computing enclosures of slow manifolds , applying it to the system from section [ s_singhopfbif ] as an example .",
    "most of the details generalize to any system of the form ( [ eq_slowfast_12 ] ) . in the description ,",
    "we comment on nontrivial differences between the general case and the example at hand .",
    "the first step of our algorithm is to triangulate a portion of the critical manifold @xmath20 . on a normally hyperbolic piece of the critical manifold , @xmath91 .",
    "the implicit function theorem implies there is locally a function @xmath92 , such that @xmath93 . in the singular hopf normal form , @xmath40",

    "we select the following points in the @xmath62 plane as vertices of a triangulation : @xmath100 note that these points are aligned along lines parallel to the fold curve @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",

    "can be modified to this setting , under appropriate assumptions on the dynamics on the slow manifold .",
    "generalization to slow manifolds of saddle type in higher dimensional ambient spaces is substantially more challenging .",

    "this section discusses details of several and motivates our choices .    * our enclosures",
    "were constructed as pairs of enclosing transversal piecewise linear surfaces .",
    "there are several alternative approaches to how to construct and refine the vertices of the enclosing triangulated surfaces @xmath63 and @xmath64 . for the examples in sections [ s_numres ] and [ s_tang ] we used rectangular patches in the domain of the slow variables",
    "instead , one could construct the triangulations of the original domain in the slow variables by considering a dynamically defined region , constructed by flowing a set of initial conditions on the critical manifold with the slow flow , and use a discretization of those trajectories as the vertices of the triangulation .",

    "if the triangulation remains a graph over the @xmath62 domain , it is possible to generate a new triangulation by a delaunay - type algorithm , and lift it to the surface , but if two vertices flow to the same @xmath62 coordinate this is no longer possible",

    "a third drawback is that the triangulations might develop very acute triangles .",
    "finally , numerical integration of a large number of vertices is slow compared to the approach that we use .",
    "moving vertices along the normals combines the worst of both methods : we no longer control the triangulations , and we might introduce violations of the transversality conditions .",
    "* the tightening procedure described in section [ ss_impbound ] only updates one vertex at the time , i.e. , we move one vertex a big step and if all the faces attached to it are still transversal to the flow , then we move it .",

    "such a procedure would work as follows : when it is one vertex `` turn '' , only update it by a fraction of its potential improvement , and simultaneously move the ones it attaches to , by a smaller amount .",
    "the smaller neighbour updates should be such that the expected value of the total update of each vertex stays the same as in section [ ss_impbound ] .",
    "the benefit of such an approach is that the triangulation is not skewed as much in each step , so it should be easier to verify the transversality condition . in practice , however , the gain of this approach is negligible , compared to a slight increase of the denominator of ( [ eq_update ] ) .",
    "there are also disadvantages of such an approach , primarily in its computational complexity .",
    "each time an update is made , one has to not only locate all its neighbouring vertices and update them , but also locate all of their neighbouring faces and check the transversality condition on them . in the results presented in section [ s_numres ] , we thus only update one vertex at the time . *",
    "we construct invariant cone fields on @xmath65 to prove that it contains normally hyperbolic locally invariant manifolds .",
    "we constructed these manifolds by flowing a `` ribbon '' around the inflowing boundaries of the enclosure .",
    "the property that our enclosures were aligned with the flow in the sense that for one of the slow variables the vector field is non - zero , was crucial for proving the existence of computable slow manifolds . in general",
