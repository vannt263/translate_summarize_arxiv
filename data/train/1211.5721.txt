    "primordial circumstellar disks with inner cavities or gaps are known as  transitional \" disks and can be identified by their peculiar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , which have reduced levels of near- and/or mid - ir excesses with respect to the vast majority of classical t tauri star ( ctts ) disks .",
    "nevertheless , not all transitional disk seds look the same and it is clear that not all inner holes and gaps are produced in the same way .",
    "grain - growth , photoevaporation , and dynamical interactions with ( sub)stellar companions can all result in transitional disk seds ( see williams @xmath5 cieza , 2011 , for a recent review ) . distinguishing between the processes that could be responsible for the unusual seds of transitional disks requires considerable information : sed shapes , accretion rates , disk masses , and multiplicity information ( najita et al . 2007 ) .",
    "fl cha belongs to a subclass of transitional objects known as  pre - transitional \" disks , which is characterized by a pronounced  dip \" in the mid - ir sed ( espaillat et al .",
    "the seds of pre - transitional disks can be reproduced with models presenting a wide ( @xmath65 - 10  au ) optically thin gap separating an optically thick inner disk from an optically thick outer disk .",
    "the inner and the outer disk components of pre - transitional objects have already been resolved by long - baseline interferometry observations in the near - ir ( e.g. , olofsson et al .",
    "2011 ; tatulli et al .",
    "2011 ) and the submillimeter ( e.g. , andrews et al . 2011 ) , respectively , confirming the gapped structure .",
    "these gaps are not necessarily empty .",
    "deep polarized intensity images reveal a population of @xmath7m - sized grains within some of the gaps ( dong et al .",
    "2012 ) and the accretion rates onto the stars in pre - transitional systems suggest that the inner disks are continuously replenished with material from the outer disks . since pre - transitional disks tend to lack stellar companions ( pott et al . 2010 ; kraus et al .",
    "2011 ) , their gaps are best explained by the dynamical interaction of unseen substellar or planetary - mass objects embedded in the disk ( dobson - robinson @xmath5 salyk , 2012 ) .",
    "recent high - contrast observations using the sparse aperture masking ( sam ) interferometric technique on keck and the vlt have already identified companion candidates to two other pre - transitional disks , t cha ( hulamo et al .",
    "2011 ) and lkca 15 ( kraus @xmath5 ireland , 2012 ) .",
    "fl cha is a k8 ctts ( luhman 2007 ) in the chamaeleon i molecular cloud , located at 160 pc ( whittet et al .",
    "1997 ) . as part of a program aiming the direct detection of young planets in transitional disks",
    "( see also schreiber et al .",
    "2013 ) , we have obtained deep vlt - sam observations of fl cha .",
    "our sam data show non - zero closure phases indicating a second source of near - ir emission besides the central star .",
    "we also present radiative transfer modeling of the fl cha sed , in order to better constrain the size of the gap , and discuss the possible nature of the newly identified source .",
    "the vlt - sam observations of fl cha were performed on march 6 , 2012 , using the  7-hole \" mask ( tuthill et al .",
    "2010 ) on the naos - conica ( naco ) adaptive optics system ( lenzen et al .",
    "2003 ) . the mask at the pupil - plane blocks most of the light from target and resamples the primary mirror into a set of smaller sub - apertures that form a sparse interferometric array with 21 baselines .",
    "sam observations allow for exquisite calibration of the point spread function of the stellar primary and the suppression of speckle noise by the application of interferometric analysis techniques , such as the measurement of closure phases ( the sum of the phases around any 3 triangle of baselines ) .",
    "the sam technique is sensitive to companions in the @xmath40.5 - 5 @xmath8/d separation range ( corresponding to @xmath430 - 300 mas for k@xmath0-band observations in the vlt ) and can reach a contrast limit of @xmath3k@xmath47 mag at @xmath8/d ( kraus & ireland , 2012 ) .",
    "the observing sequence consisted of multiple  visits \" ( 4 observations of 25 frames of 10  s in k@xmath9-band ) of fl cha , alternating with observations of the stars fi  cha , fk  cha , and 2mass  j11082577 - 7648315 used as calibrators . during the same observing run",
    ", we also observed the close binary system rx  j1106.3 - 7721 ( lafrenire et al .",
    "2008 ) in the l@xmath10-band to validate our observing strategy and data reduction technique .",
    "the observations were reduced using the paris samp pipeline as described by lacour et al .",
    "both fl cha and rx  j1106.3 - 7721 show non - zero closure phases , indicting a departure from a single point - source detection ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "in order to constrain the properties of the sam detections , we first performed a monte carlo markov chain analysis using a simple binary model with 3 basic parameters : two positional parameters , either separation and position angle ( pa ) or @xmath3ra and @xmath3dec , and the magnitude difference ( @xmath3 m ) .",
    "the @xmath11 maps of such models are shown in figure  1 for both fl cha and rx  j1106.3 - 7721 .",
    "our procedure is identical to the one used by schreiber et al .",
    "we find that the binary parameters for the rx  j1106.3 - 7721 system are _ very _ well constrained by our observations and robust to the choice of priors ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the flux asymmetry signal in the closure phases of fl cha is much weaker and results in much larger uncertainties in the model - derived parameters .",
    "while the pa is relatively well constrained , @xmath3 m and separation remain degenerate and highly dependent on the choice of prior distributions .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 2 , where we show the posteriori probability distributions for two different sets of priors : 1 ) uniform distributions for @xmath3ra , @xmath3dec , and @xmath3 m and 2 ) uniform distributions for pa , @xmath3 m , and the logarithm of the separation .",
    "the data favors a @xmath3 m @xmath44.8 mag source , but there is a long tail in the probability distribution extending to lower @xmath3 m values .",
    "the posteriori distribution of the separation could be bimodal or unimodal depending on the adopted prior .",
    "the degeneracy between the @xmath3 m and separation parameters is a known problem for small separations ( @xmath12 @xmath8/d ) in aperture masking observations ( pravdo et al .",
    "2006 , martinache et al . 2009 ) and is clearly seen in the joint distributions shown in figure  2 .",
    "the complex @xmath11 surfaces in the joint distributions are consistent with two families of solutions : a relative bright source ( @xmath3k @xmath41 - 3 mag ) at @xmath415 mas ( 2.4  au ) and a much fainter one ( @xmath3k @xmath44 - 5 mag ) at @xmath430 - 40 mas ( 5.0 - 6.5  au ) .",
    "the relative probability of these two solutions strongly depends on the choice of prior and can not be unambiguously estimated with the available data .",
    "future h - band observations should provide the additional resolution needed to break the @xmath3m - separation degeneracy and solve the two - solution ambiguity in the context of the binary model ( see schreiber et al . 2013 ) .",
    "espaillat et al . ( 2011 ) successfully reproduced the optical to 38 @xmath7 m sed of fl cha adopting a simple model consisting of two vertical walls : one inner wall at the dust sublimation distance of 0.04 au that is responsible for the near - ir excess and an outer wall at 15 au that reproduces the observed mid - ir excess .",
    "here we use a more physical model in order to provide further constraints on the size and location of the gap in the disk .",
    "we include photometry data at longer wavelengths ( 70 and 870 @xmath7 m ) , which are sensitive to the properties of the outer disk .",
    "we constructed the fl cha sed from the sources listed in table 1 .",
    "we have also obtained 870 @xmath7 m photometry with the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) using the laboca camera ( siringo et al .",
    "the observations were executed on july 24 , 2012 using the ",
    "wobbler on - off \" mode and reduced with the standard bolometer array data analysis package boa .",
    "fl cha was detected with a signal to noise ratio of 12 .",
    "the sed of fl  cha is also well sampled by a _",
    "spitzer_-irs spectrum covering the 5.2 to 38 @xmath7 m region ( astronomical observation request @xmath1312696320 ) .",
    "the 0.44 to 870 @xmath7 m sed is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the optical and near - ir wavelengths were corrected by extinction , adopting a@xmath14 = 3.14 mag ( calculated from the r@xmath15-i@xmath15 color excess ) and the extinction relations listed in cieza et al .",
    "the median sed of cttss from furlan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) is shown for comparison . the sharp  dip \" in the fl cha",
    "sed around 15 @xmath7 m indicates the presence of a wide gap in the disk .",
    "we model the observed sed using the monte carlo radiative transfer code mcfost ( pinte et al .",
    "we parameterize the structure of the fl cha disk with two independent components , an inner and an outer disk .",
    "each component is described by the following parameters : the inner and outer radii ( r@xmath16 and r@xmath17 , respectively ) and the index @xmath18 for the surface density profile ( @xmath19(r ) = @xmath20(r/10 au)@xmath21 ) . the scale height as a function of radius is given by @xmath22 = h@xmath23(r/10 au)@xmath24 .",
    "the grain size distribution has the form d@xmath25(a)@xmath26",
    "a@xmath27d@xmath28 , between the minimum ( a@xmath29 ) and maximum ( a@xmath30 ) grain sizes .",
    "the width of the gap in the disk is simply given by : @xmath31 - @xmath32 .",
    "the parameters a@xmath29 , a@xmath30 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath18 , and r@xmath35 , and the disk inclination are not easily constrained by the available data .",
    "we thus fix them to more or less  standard \" values , which are listed in table 2 : for the dust composition , we follow espaillat et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and adopt a 40@xmath36/60@xmath36 mixture of amorphous and crystalline silicates .",
    "we adopt the fitting procedure described by mathews et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , which uses the levenberg - marquardt @xmath11 minimization algorithm to calculate the numerical gradients of the @xmath11 function and determine the next point in the parameter space to be sampled until the algorithm converges to a @xmath11 minimum .",
    "we ran the search algorithm 10 times using different starting values to better sample the parameter space .",
    "each of the runs results in a set of best - fit parameters , the distribution of which can be used to calculate the mean and associated uncertainty .",
    "the results of the 10 runs are listed in table  2 and the structure of our best - fit model is shown in figure  3 .",
    "we find that the near - ir excess is best reproduced by a very narrow ring at the dust sublimation radius , extending from 0.04 to 0.06 au , in agreement with the modeling results by espaillat et al ( 2011 ) .",
    "we also find that inner disks wider than @xmath40.1 au significantly overproduce the observed near - ir fluxes and that the dip characteristic of pre - transitional disk seds disappears for inner disks wider than @xmath43 au ( for the given @xmath31 value , resulting in gaps narrower than @xmath45 au ) . in our model , the inner edge of the outer disk is located at 8.3@xmath21.3 au from the star .",
    "this distance is a factor of @xmath42 smaller than that estimated by espaillat et al .",
    "the source of the discrepancy is unclear , but since our models share the same stellar parameters , it is likely to be related to the different parametrizations used for the disk structure ( two vertical walls versus a full 3-d disk model ) and the different grain size distributions adopted . resolved submillimeter images with alma should be able to directly measure the cavity size and settle the discrepancy .",
    "our sed model also constrains the properties of the outer disk .",
    "in particular , we find the fl cha disk is relatively  typical \" , with a mass of 7.5 m@xmath37 and a scale height of @xmath41 au at a radius of 10 au .",
    "the probability @xmath38 for an unrelated source to be located within a certain angular distance @xmath39 from a particular target is given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the cumulative surface density of background sources down to a limiting magnitude @xmath42 ( brandner et al .",
    "fl cha is 9.11 mag in k@xmath0-band .",
    "therefore , the peak in the @xmath3k@xmath0 probability distribution correspond to an apparent k@xmath43band magnitude of @xmath413.9 .",
    "since there are 7482 stars brighter than k@xmath0 = 13.9 mag within a 1 deg radius of fl cha in the @xmath44 catalog , the probability of a background source at a @xmath120.050@xmath45 separation is of the order of @xmath46 .",
    "background contamination can thus be discarded as a likely explanation for our sam detection .      in section  [ mcmc ]",
    ", we found the sam data is consistent with both a relative bright source ( @xmath3k@xmath471 - 3 mag ) at a projected separation of @xmath42.4 au or a much fainter one ( @xmath3k @xmath44 - 5 mag ) at @xmath45.0 - 6.5 au .",
    "evolutionary tracks of young low - mass objects are _ very _ uncertain , but can be used to address the nature of the putative companion and try to distinguish between a low - mass star , a brown dwarf , or a planet . according to the evolutionary tracks by siess et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , fl cha is a 0.6 m@xmath48 star and the former solution corresponds to a stellar companion with a mass in the @xmath120.1 - 0.3 m@xmath49 range . in the recent radial velocity ( rv ) monitoring study of chamaeleon",
    "i objects performed by nguyen et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , fl cha showed a constant rv ( 16.9@xmath21.1 km / s ) , close to the typical values in the region ( @xmath415.3@xmath22 km / s ) , over the 1 month baseline of the study . while the precision and time baseline of the measurements are clearly not enough to rule out most stellar binaries , the rv measurements disfavor solutions with stellar companions at @xmath42.4 au .",
    "as a reference , a 0.1 m@xmath48 companion to a 0.6 m@xmath48 star with circular edge - on orbit and a 2.4 au semi - major axis has a period of 4.46 years and a velocity amplitude of @xmath22.5 km / sec .",
    "we now consider the nature of the source if @xmath3k@xmath9 is close to the @xmath44.8 mag peak shown in the probability distributions from figure 2 .",
    "this peak corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath47.9 at 160 pc .",
    "this renders our source a factor of 3 brighter than the protoplanet candidate identified by kraus @xmath5 ireland ( 2012 ) within the gap of the lkca 15 disk , and the  hot start \" models by chabrier et al .",
    "( 2000 ) assign it a mass of @xmath415 - 20 m@xmath37 , for an age of 1 myr .",
    "taken at face value , this would place the object at the bottom of the brown dwarf mass function .",
    "however , since the source seems to be located inside the gap of an accreting transitional disk , the inner disk of which is mostly depleted , it is reasonable to expect material from the outer disk to flow across the gap onto the inner disk and then the star . under such circumstances ,",
    "the low - mass object inside the gap should accrete most of the material being transported across the outer disk ( lubow @xmath5 dangelo , 2006 ) , resulting in significant accretion luminosity .",
    "sam observations in h- and l - band would provide near - ir colors and help establishing whether the fl cha detection is consistent with a brown dwarf or an actively accreting protoplanet surrounded by a disk , as seems to be the case in the lkca  15 system .",
    "our sam detection is inconsistent with direct thermal emission from the _ inner _ disk .",
    "our radiative transfer model suggests that the inner disk is @xmath121 mas in diameter and the thermal contribution from the outer disk to the observed k - band flux is @xmath500.01@xmath36 .",
    "however , starlight scattered off the inner edge of the _ outer _ disk can in principle produce the observed signal .",
    "if the disk is highly inclined , the brightness of the projected rim would be asymmetric and could result in non - zero closure phases . to test this hypothesis , we generated a 2.2 @xmath7 m ray traced image of the best - fit mcfost model described in section  [ disk - model ] and calculated the closure phases of the resulting image as seen at different position angles and inclinations ( figure  [ fig : disk ] ) .",
    "we find that a disk inclined by @xmath460 @xmath51 from face - on with a position angle of @xmath4150 deg results in closure phases that fit the sam data almost as well as the best - fit binary model described in section  [ mcmc ] does ( @xmath11 @xmath4140 vs. @xmath4130 ) .",
    "the difference in the @xmath11 results is mostly due to the fact that the disk model produces slightly smaller phase values compared to both the binary model and the sam data .",
    "however , we emphasize that the 2.2 @xmath7 m model image depends on disk properties that are poorly constrained , such as the grain size distribution , the dust composition , and the detailed structure of both the inner and the outer disk .",
    "these disks parameters could be varied to improve the fit further .",
    "pending more constraints ( i.e. , resolved images ) , the current model suffices to show that a disk ( which also fits the sed ) can produce the necessary closure phase signal .",
    "this demonstrates that _ the circumstellar disk must be taken into consideration when interpreting sam data of transitional disks with inner cavities that are large enough to become resolved .",
    "_ high - resolution submillimeter imaging with alma would reveal the exact orientation and size of the cavity in the fl cha disk .",
    "such imaging should establish whether our sam detection is in fact consistent with starlight scattered off the disk or , on the contrary , if the source is located well inside the hole , as in the case of the lkca 15 system .",
    "measuring the k@xmath9-h and k@xmath9-l colors of the source would also help testing the scattered light hypothesis .",
    "looking for orbital motion from multi - epoch sam observations should provide the ultimate test to distinguish between a companion and the scattered light scenario .",
    "from vlt - sam observations , we have identified a near - ir flux asymmetry in the pre - transitional object fl cha . by modeling its sed , we find that the gap in its disks extends from 0.06@xmath1 au to 8.3@xmath21.3 au .",
    "we have considered several potential possibilities for the nature of the source : a low - mass star , a brown dwarf , a protoplanet , thermal emission or starlight scattered off the disk , or a background object . only direct thermal emission from the inner disk and background contamination can be ruled out .",
    "we find that light scattered off the inner edge of the _ outer _ disk can result in closure phases that fit the sam data almost as well as binary models do .",
    "single - epoch , single - filter sam observations of transitional disks should thus be interpreted very cautiously , taking the disk into consideration . in the context of a binary model , the closure phases are most consistent with a @xmath3k@xmath0 @xmath44.8 mag source at a 6  au projected separation , but a much brighter one ( @xmath3k@xmath0 @xmath41 mag ) at 2.4 au can also reproduce the signal .",
    "h- and l - band sam observations of fl cha are highly desirable to 1 ) test for orbital motion , 2 ) break the current degeneracy between @xmath3mag and separation in the binary model , and 3 ) provide near - ir colors to help distinguishing between the possible explanations .",
    "resolved submillimeter images with alma are needed to establish the orientation of the system and provide a _",
    "direct _ measurement of the inner cavity size to test the scattered light hypothesis and to better constrain the properties of the outer disk .",
