    "before we consider the double power case , we recall some well - known results for the single power case : @xmath32 when @xmath33 , the standing wave solution @xmath26 of is stable for all @xmath9 ( see @xcite ) . while , if @xmath34 , then @xmath26 is strongly unstable for all @xmath9 ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
