    "this behavior is the same for poles in the second or third sheet .",

    "this will be of importance in the following section .",
    "we briefly remark that if the coupling of the mesons to the resonance becomes strong enough the physical resonance finally becomes a bound state .",
    "this bound state is then represented by a pole in the first sheet on the real axis below pion threshold . indeed , with increasing coupling constants the pole of the second sheet moves towards ( and finally onto ) the pion threshold where it can pass across the branch point to the first sheet .",

    "we find a pole on the @xmath2 sheet close to the eta threshold which is responsible for the cusp peak . this pole has not previously been discussed .",
    "no additional resonance pole in the @xmath142 or @xmath141 sheet is needed to account for the cusp peak .",
    "we can trace back the origin of this pole by numerically lowering the respective eta meson coupling constants as described in sect .",
    "[ chapsmatrix ] .",
    "the pole then moves back to its original starting point , which is different for the two models .",
    "for the case of the model with resonance @xmath3 the pole is originally a resonance pole in the @xmath141 sheet that has been pushed into the @xmath2 sheet by the strong coupling to the eta meson , whereas in the model without resonance @xmath3 the pole always stays in the @xmath2 sheet .",
    "another pole in the @xmath142 sheet for the case of the model with resonance @xmath3 is the resonance pole of the resonance @xmath3 .",
    "finally we have compared our direct determination of the poles with the speed plot technique suggested by hhler @xcite .",
    "the pole of the resonance @xmath6 in the @xmath142 sheet is very well reproduced by the speed technique and found as ( 1666 - 81i ) mev in our model with @xmath3 and as ( 1671 - 57i ) mev in our model without @xmath143 .",
    "in addition in both our models we see a very narrow spike with a width of a few mev at the @xmath1 threshold which corresponds to the cusp . the resonance pole of the @xmath3 in our model does not show up using the speed technique .",
    "it is entirely covered by the cusp effect .",
    "in order to check the consistency of our model and to further study the role of the resonance @xmath3 , we studied eta and pion photoproduction .",
    "since the photon coupling is weak , we use perturbation theory for the photoproduction .",
    "the strong interaction is still fully accounted for as we can employ the full analytical solution of the strong interacting particles discussed in the preceding sections .",
    "[ abbphotovertex ] shows how the photon couples to the hadrons via resonance and contact interactions .",
    "the matrix elements are defined as follows : @xmath144 @xmath145 where @xmath31 is again the index for the resonances , @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the coupling constants for resonance and contact terms , respectively . the momentum and the polarization vector of the photon",
    "are denoted @xmath148 and @xmath149 , and @xmath150 is the spin of the nucleon .    to first order approximation of perturbation theory , the scattering matrix @xmath68 is then @xmath151 and @xmath152 is the outgoing scattering state as calculated in the previous section , @xmath153 the coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 are given in eqs .",
    "( [ glbeta ] ) and ( [ glalpha ] ) . as before ,",
    "we consider the two models with and without the resonance @xmath3 , with their respective parameters and coupling constants given in tab .",
    "[ tableconstants ] for pion scattering .",
    "we fitted to the eta photoproduction cross section and pion photoproduction amplitude @xmath154 ( see tab .",
    "[ tabpolstelle2 ] ) .",
    "the experimental data are taken from wilhelm @xcite and krusche @xcite for eta photoproduction and for pion photoproduction we used the vpi solution ( sp 95 ) @xcite .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ abbs11photoeta ] and [ abbrealims11 ] .",
    "the fit without resonance is not as good as the fit with the resonance .",
    "this is partially due to the smaller number of fitting parameters ( five parameters less ) .",
    "however , neither model can well describe the dip of im@xmath155 at 1600 mev .",
    "a more realistic description of the background would be necessary to better describe the data below @xmath1 threshold .",
    "this would also improve the result for eta photoproduction for the case without the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "we have constructed a generalized lee model for pion scattering and eta production in the s - wave channel . using only the hilbert subspace corresponding to the quantum numbers of the partial wave @xmath126 , the particles that appear in the model are the resonances @xmath3 and @xmath6 , the nucleon , the pion and the eta meson .",
    "these five particles interact via a resonant and a nonresonant interaction .",
    "the absence of antiparticles makes it a nonrelativistic model .",
    "however , it has the advantage of being fully unitary and analytically solvable .",
    "eta and pion photoproduction were additionally calculated using a perturbation approach .",
    "the coupling constants and other parameters of the model were determined by fitting the model to partial wave analyses and cross sections .",
    "the experimental data we used were total cross sections for eta meson production in pion scattering @xcite and eta photoproduction @xcite .",
    "in addition we employed a partial wave analysis of pion nucleon scattering and @xmath156 amplitudes for pion photoproduction @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we were interested in studying the cusp effect and in obtaining a better understanding of the interplay of the resonance @xmath3 and the cusp at eta threshold .",
    "this is particularly of importance when determining why the neighboring resonances @xmath3 and @xmath6 , having the same quantum numbers , show quite different behavior : @xmath3 couples strongly to the eta meson while the resonance @xmath6 couples to it only very weakly .",
    "following hhler s statement @xcite that partial wave analyses show no evident signature for the resonance @xmath3 , we investigated a lee model with and without the resonance @xmath3 .",
    "we found that using the lee model the experimental scattering data for various scattering channels could be qualitatively reproduced without introducing the @xmath3 resonance .",
    "therefore we think that the resonance @xmath3 is weaker and less important than generally accepted .",
    "the s - matrix , together with its riemann sheet structure , was studied .",
    "eta threshold is the branch point where the four riemann sheets meet that were of importance in our discussion .",
    "we found a specific distribution of poles on these sheets that determines the scattering amplitude on the physical axis .",
    "poles could be attributed to resonance peak or the cusp peak .",
    "more precisely a pole in the @xmath2 sheet that until now has never been taken into account , determines the shape of the cusp .",
