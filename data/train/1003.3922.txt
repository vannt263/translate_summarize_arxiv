    "a metapopulation model refers to many small local populations connected via migrations in fragmented environment .",
    "each local population evolves without spatial structure , it can increase or decrease , survive , get extinct or migrate from its site in different ways ( see @xmath1 , for more about metapopulations ) .",
    "+ the most natural model for the evolution of a single population is the branching process , see @xcite : birth and death rates depend on the number of individuals of the population , and the growth rate is density dependent .",
    "+ if the birth rate is always larger than the death rate , if the population survives , it will increase indefinitely .",
    "if the birth rate is smaller or equal than the death rate , the population will get extinct almost surely ( @xcite ) . a more interesting situation is given by a birth rate larger than the death rate under a particular population size @xmath2 , and smaller over that .",
    "the real environments observation suggests that this process is gradual , that is the growth rate decreases over a population size as population density increases . in some of our applications",
    "we suppose that over a fixed number of individuals @xmath2 ( the _ capacity _ of a site ) the growth rate is null .",
    "many biological phenomena may influence the dynamics of a metapopulation .",
    "+ migration is one of the most important strategies that a species adopts to improve its probability of survival ( see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) : when the population size is large one or more individuals leave the site where they are located to look for new resources in different sites . + other biological factors may favor the extinction of a species .",
    "one of them , _ the allee effect _ , consists in an increase of the death rate when the density of individuals is small .",
    "the reason is that at low density many factors ( as difficulties in finding mates ) cause a decrease of fecundity and an increase of mortality ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "+ we simplify the real structure and we treat @xmath3 metapopulation models from a mathematical point of view : we start from the easier one by adding a new biological phenomenon at each model .",
    "+ the mathematical models are interacting particle systems on @xmath4 , where @xmath5 : each particle represents one individual and on each site of @xmath0 there is a local population with capacity @xmath2 ( possibly @xmath6 ) , which evolves in different ways depending on the model .",
    "the local populations are connected via migrations of individuals , that is jumps of particles from a site to another one .",
    "+ in section [ background ] we introduce the particle system , we give the main definitions and notations and we state the attractiveness results , crucial in the sequel for the existence of critical parameters and non - trivial invariant measures . theorem [ cns ] , the main result of a previous paper ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4 ) , inspired by @xcite ) , gives necessary and sufficient conditions for attractiveness of a large class of particle systems .",
    "this simplifies many proofs , since in order to derive either if two processes are stochastically ordered or if a process is attractive we do not need to construct an explicit coupling for each model , but we only have to check inequalities involving the transition rates . + in @xcite and @xcite , the author considers a metapopulation model to investigate the roles of mass death ( that is the death of all individuals in a local population ) and spatial aggregation in the extinction of a species . in @xcite",
    "he shows that , in presence of mass death , animals living in large flocks are more susceptible to extinction than animals living in small flocks : for that model , mass death can be an alternative to the allee effect in raising to the exinction of a species .",
    "the new results in @xcite involve the role of spatial aggregation , which may be either bad or good for survival in a model respectively with or without mass death .",
    "for these models the local population allee effect was not taken into account .",
    "the model introduced , called _ non - catastrophic times model _ , is the following : for a fixed @xmath7 , on each site of @xmath8 we may have up to @xmath2 individuals : hence @xmath2 is the _ capacity _ of sites .",
    "the transitions of the markov process @xmath9 are @xmath10 where @xmath11 are neighbors . in other words",
    "each individual gives birth to another one on the same site with rate @xmath12 and dies with rate @xmath13 .",
    "an individual on site @xmath14 gives birth to a new individual in a neighboring site with rate @xmath15 only when the population at @xmath14 has reached the maximal size @xmath2 .",
    "there is a critical parameter for the capacity @xmath2 of sites :    ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) + assume that @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "there is a critical value @xmath19 such that if @xmath20 , then starting from any finite number of individuals , the population has a strictly positive probability of surviving .",
    "[ intr : schi1 ]    starting from non - catastrophic times model , we propose @xmath3 models to improve the understanding of species dynamics .",
    "we want to investigate , _ for the first time in a model with spatial structure _ , the role of the allee effect , the role of mass migration and their interactions .    in section [ modeli ]",
    "we introduce _ model i_. this will represent our basic model with neither allee effect nor mass migration .",
    "we begin with a system very similar to schinazi s model : since a further step consists in adding migration of many individuals , we consider a migration of one individual to a neighboring site instead of a birth of a new individual . if @xmath21 such a difference does not allow survival for the model with migrations , since no new births are possible , and the process gets extinct for any @xmath22 : this is definitely not the case for the non catastrophic times model with @xmath21 , which is the contact process .",
    "if @xmath2 is large this small difference does not change the behaviour of the model .",
    "+ this is the basic model and it must be as easy as possible ( births and deaths on the same site and migrations from one site to another , all for at most one particle at time ) .",
    "for this reason we do not consider mass death , which is an additional complex factor .",
    "+ we take the birth rate larger than the death rate , but we fix a capacity @xmath2 per site . a migration of one individual from a site @xmath14 towards a nearest neighbor one is allowed only when the population on @xmath14 reaches @xmath2 .",
    "we prove that in some cases there is almost sure extinction and in others the species survives with positive probability : the key tool to prove survival is the comparison technique with a supercritical oriented percolation model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in section [ modelii ] we introduce _ model ii _ , that points out the key role of the allee effect in species dynamics .",
    "schinazi used mass death to prove that it can be considered an alternative to the alle effect for extinction of a species .",
    "since both the allee effect and mass death improve the probability of extinction , in order to understand the role of one of them they should be considered separately . here",
    "we want to show that a strong allee effect ( with neither mass death nor mass migration ) is a key factor for the extinction .",
    "+ we add the allee effect to model i. different probabilistic tools have already been used to illustrate the allee effect like stochastic differential equations ( see @xcite ) , discrete - time markov chains ( see @xcite ) or diffusion processes ( see @xcite ) , but none of these models has a spatial structure . + in model ii each site has a capacity @xmath2 , but the death rate is larger than the birth rate for small densities . migration works exactly as in model i. theorem [ phasetransition2 ] states that for all possible capacities , growth and migration rates , there exists an allee effect large enough for the species to get extinct .",
    "it is proved through comparison with subcritical percolation .    in _ model iii _ , introduced in section [ modeliii ] , we allow a migration of more than one individual at a time from one site to the neighboring one in a species affected by the allee effect . we prove that _ mass migration might be the possible strategy of a species to reduce the allee effect _ and improve its survival probability .",
    "+ when a local population size reaches @xmath2 , a migration of a number of individual smaller than a fixed @xmath23 is possible . in model ii , for an allee effect large enough",
    ", the species gets extinct . in model iii , if @xmath2 is large enough there exists @xmath23 such that this is no longer true .",
    "a migration of large flocks avoids small densities in a new environment which are bad for survival . indeed , by comparison arguments with oriented percolation , even if the allee effect is the strongest one , if the species lives and migrates in flocks large enough , survival is possible ( theorem [ phasetransition3 ] ) .    in section [ modeliv ]",

    "is no maximal size , but a kind of self - mechanism of birth control such that the death rate is larger than the birth rate when there are more than @xmath2 individuals in a local population .",
    "a migration of one or more individuals is allowed from a site with more than @xmath2 individuals towards a site with few individuals .",
    "we prove in theorem [ phasetransition4 ] that in some cases we can have survival but on each site the population does not explode even if there is no capacity .",
    "namely on each site the expected value of the number of individuals is finite . in other cases the species",
    "gets extinct .",
    "+ note that on each model instead of fixing the death rate equal to 1 and letting the birth rate vary ( the most used approach ) , we consider the reverse but equivalent point of view in order to clarify our proofs , presented in section [ proofs ] .",
