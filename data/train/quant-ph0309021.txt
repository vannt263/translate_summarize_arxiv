    "in classical mechanics , ensembles , such as the microcanonical and canonical ensembles , are represented by probability distributions on the phase space . in quantum mechanics , ensembles",
    "are usually represented by density matrices .",
    "it is natural to regard these density matrices as arising from probability distributions on the ( normalized ) wave functions associated with the thermodynamical ensembles , so that members of the ensemble are represented by a random state vector .",
    "there are , however , as is well known , many probability distributions which give rise to the same density matrix , and thus to the same predictions for experimental outcomes @xcite .. the measure that gives equal weight to these two states corresponds to the same density matrix as the one giving equal weight to @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "however the physical situation corresponding to the former measure , a mixture of two grotesque superpositions , seems dramatically different from the one corresponding to the latter , a routine mixture .",
    "it is thus not easy to regard these two measures as physically equivalent .",
    "] moreover , as emphasized by landau and lifshitz @xcite , the energy levels for macroscopic systems are so closely spaced ( exponentially small in the number of particles in the system ) that `` the concept of stationary states [ energy eigenfunctions ] becomes in a certain sense unrealistic '' because of the difficulty of preparing a system with such a sharp energy and keeping it isolated .",
    "landau and lifshitz are therefore wary of , and warn against , regarding the density matrix for such a system as arising solely from our lack of knowledge about the wave function of the system .",
    "we shall argue , however , that despite these caveats such distributions can be both useful and physically meaningful . in particular we describe here a novel probability distribution , to be associated with any thermal ensemble such as the canonical ensemble .",
    "while probability distributions on wave functions are natural objects of study in many contexts , from quantum chaos @xcite to open quantum systems @xcite , our main motivation for considering them is to exploit the analogy between classical and quantum statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "this analogy suggests that some relevant classical reasonings can be transferred to quantum mechanics by formally replacing the classical phase space by the unit sphere @xmath7 of the quantum system s hilbert space @xmath2 . in particular , with a natural measure @xmath8 on @xmath7 one",
    "can utilize the notion of typicality , i.e. , consider properties of a system common to `` almost all '' members of an ensemble .",
    "this is a notion frequently used in equilibrium statistical mechanics , as in , e.g. , boltzmann s recognition that typical phase points on the energy surface of a macroscopic system are such that the empirical distribution of velocities is approximately maxwellian .",
    "once one has such a measure for quantum systems , one could attempt an analysis of the second law of thermodynamics in quantum mechanics along the lines of boltzmann s analysis of the second law in classical mechanics , involving an argument to the effect that the behavior described in the second law ( such as entropy increase ) occurs for typical states of an isolated macroscopic system , i.e.  for the overwhelming majority of points on @xmath7 with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "probability distributions on wave functions of a composite system , with hilbert space @xmath2 , have in fact been used to establish the typical properties of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem arising from the wave function of the composite .",
    "for example , page @xcite considers the uniform distribution on @xmath7 for a finite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath2 , in terms of which he shows that the von neumann entropy of the reduced density matrix is typically nearly maximal under appropriate conditions on the dimensions of the relevant hilbert spaces .    given a probability distribution @xmath1 on the unit sphere @xmath7 of the hilbert space @xmath2",
    "there is always an associated density matrix @xmath10 @xcite : it is the density matrix of the mixture , or the statistical ensemble of systems , defined by the distribution @xmath1 , given by @xmath11 for any projection operator @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the probability of obtaining in an experiment a result corresponding to @xmath12 for a system with a @xmath1-distributed wave function .",
    "it is evident from that @xmath10 is the second moment , or covariance matrix , of @xmath1 , provided @xmath1 has mean 0 ( which may , and will , be assumed without loss of generality since @xmath14 and @xmath15 are equivalent physically ) .",
    "while a probability measure @xmath1 on @xmath7 determines a unique density matrix @xmath0 on @xmath2 via , the converse is not true : the association @xmath16 given by is many - to - one .- dimensional hilbert space the uniform probability distribution @xmath17 over the unit sphere has density matrix @xmath18 with @xmath19 the identity operator on @xmath2 ; at the same time , for every orthonormal basis of @xmath2 the uniform distribution over the basis ( which is a measure concentrated on just @xmath20 points ) has the same density matrix , @xmath21 .",
    "an exceptional case is the density matrix corresponding to a pure state , @xmath22 , as the measure @xmath1 with this density matrix is almost unique : it must be concentrated on the ray through @xmath14 , and thus the only non - uniqueness corresponds to the distribution of the phase .",
    "] there is furthermore no unique `` physically correct '' choice of @xmath1 for a given @xmath0 since for any @xmath1 corresponding to @xmath0 one could , in principle , prepare an ensemble of systems with wave functions distributed according to this @xmath1 .",
    "however , while @xmath0 itself need not determine a unique probability measure , additional facts about a system , such as that it has come to thermal equilibrium , might .",
    "it is thus not unreasonable to ask : which measure on @xmath7 corresponds to a given thermodynamic ensemble ?",
    "let us start with the _ microcanonical _ ensemble , corresponding to the energy interval @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 is small on the macroscopic scale but large enough for the interval to contain many eigenvalues . to this",
    "there is associated the spectral subspace @xmath25 , the span of the eigenstates @xmath26 of the hamiltonian @xmath27 corresponding to eigenvalues @xmath28 between @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath25 is finite dimensional , one can form the _ microcanonical density matrix _ @xmath31 with @xmath32}(h)$ ] the projection to @xmath25 .",
    "this density matrix is diagonal in the energy representation and gives equal weight to all energy eigenstates in the interval @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "but what is the corresponding _ microcanonical measure _ ?",
    "the most plausible answer , given long ago by schrdinger @xcite and bloch @xcite , is the ( normalized ) uniform measure @xmath33 on the unit sphere in this subspace .",
    "@xmath34 is associated with @xmath35 via .",
    "note that a wave function @xmath36 chosen at random from this distribution is almost certainly a nontrivial superposition of the eigenstates @xmath37 with random coefficients @xmath38 that are identically distributed , but not independent .",
    "the measure @xmath35 is clearly stationary , i.e. , invariant under the unitary time evolution generated by @xmath27 , and it is as spread out as it could be over the set @xmath39 of allowed wave functions .",
    "this measure provides us with a notion of a `` typical wave function '' from @xmath25 which is very different from the one arising from the measure @xmath40 that , when @xmath27 is nondegenerate , gives equal probability @xmath41 to every eigenstate @xmath42 with eigenvalue @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "the measure @xmath40 , which is concentrated on these eigenstates , is , however , less robust to small perturbations in @xmath27 than is the smoother measure @xmath35 .",
    "our proposal for the canonical ensemble is in the spirit of the uniform microcanonical measure @xmath35 and reduces to it in the appropriate cases .",
    "it is based on a mathematically natural family of probability measures @xmath1 on @xmath7 . for every density matrix @xmath0 on @xmath2",
    ", there is a unique member @xmath1 of this family , satisfying for @xmath44 , namely the _ gaussian adjusted projected measure _ @xmath3 , constructed roughly as follows : eq .",
    "( i.e. , the fact that @xmath10 is the covariance of @xmath1 ) suggests that we start by considering the gaussian measure @xmath45 with covariance @xmath0 ( and mean 0 ) , which could , in finitely many dimensions , be expressed by @xmath46 ( where @xmath47 is the obvious lebesgue measure on @xmath2 ) .",
    "this is not adequate , however , since the measure that we seek must live on the sphere @xmath7 whereas @xmath45 is spread out over all of @xmath2 .",
    "we thus adjust and then project @xmath45 to @xmath7 , in the manner described in section  [ sec : defmeasure ] , in order to obtain the measure @xmath3 , having the prescribed covariance @xmath0 as well as other desirable properties .",
    "it is our contention that _ a quantum system in thermal equilibrium at inverse temperature @xmath48 should be described by a random state vector whose distribution is given by the measure @xmath49 associated with the density matrix for the canonical ensemble , _",
    "@xmath50    in order to convey the significance of @xmath3 as well as the plausibility of our proposal that @xmath49 describes thermal equilibrium , we recall that a system described by a canonical ensemble is usually regarded as a subsystem of a larger system .",
    "it is therefore important to consider the notion of the distribution of the wave function of a subsystem .",
    "consider a composite system in a pure state @xmath51 , and ask what might be meant by the wave function of the subsystem with hilbert space @xmath52 .",
    "for this we propose the following .",
    "let @xmath53 be a ( generalized ) orthonormal basis of @xmath54 ( playing the role , say , of the eigenbasis of the position representation ) .",
    "for each choice of @xmath55 , the ( partial ) scalar product @xmath56 , taken in @xmath54 , is a vector belonging to @xmath52 .",
    "regarding @xmath55 as random , we are led to consider the random vector @xmath57 given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the normalizing factor and @xmath60 is a random element of the basis @xmath53 , chosen with the quantum distribution @xmath61 we refer to @xmath62 as the _ conditional wave function _",
    "@xcite of system 1 .",
    "note that @xmath62 becomes doubly random when we start with a random wave function in @xmath63 instead of a fixed one .",
    "the distribution of @xmath62 corresponding to ( [ psi1def ] ) and ( [ marg ] ) is given by the probability measure on @xmath64 , @xmath65 where @xmath66 denotes the `` delta '' measure concentrated at @xmath67 .",
    "while the density matrix @xmath68 associated with @xmath69 always equals the reduced density matrix @xmath70 of system 1 , given by @xmath71 the measure @xmath72 itself usually depends on the choice of the basis @xmath73 .",
    "it turns out , nevertheless , as we point out in section  [ sec : typicality ] , that @xmath74 is a universal function of @xmath70 in the special case that system 2 is large and @xmath14 is typical ( with respect to the uniform distribution on all wave functions with the same reduced density matrix ) , namely @xmath75 .",
    "thus @xmath3 has a distinguished , universal status among all probability measures on @xmath7 with density matrix @xmath0 .    to further support our claim that @xmath49 is the right measure for @xmath76 , we shall regard , as is usually done , the system described by @xmath76 as coupled to a ( very large ) heat bath .",
    "the interaction between the heat bath and the system is assumed to be ( in some suitable sense ) negligible .",
    "we will argue that if the wave function @xmath14 of the combined `` system plus bath '' has microcanonical distribution @xmath35 , then the distribution of the conditional wave function of the ( small ) system is approximately @xmath77 ; see section  [ sec : hb1 ] .    indeed , a stronger statement is true .",
    "as we argue in section  [ sec : hb2 ] , even for a typical _ fixed _ microcanonical wave function @xmath14 of the composite , i.e. , one typical for @xmath35 , the conditional wave function of the system , defined in , is then approximately @xmath49-distributed , for a typical basis @xmath53 .",
    "this is related to the fact that for a typical microcanonical wave function @xmath14 of the composite the reduced density matrix for the system is approximately @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "note that the analogous statement in classical mechanics would be wrong : for a fixed phase point @xmath78 of the composite , be it typical or atypical , the phase point of the system could never be random , but rather would merely be the part of @xmath78 belonging to the system .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : defmeasure ] we define the measure @xmath3 and obtain several ways of writing it . in section  [ sec : prop ] we describe some natural mathematical properties of these measures , and suggest that these properties uniquely characterize the measures . in section  [ sec : hb1 ] we argue that @xmath49 represents the canonical ensemble . in section  [ sec : typicality ] we outline the proof that @xmath3 is the distribution of the conditional wave function for _ most _ wave functions in @xmath63 with reduced density matrix @xmath0 if system 2 is large , and show that @xmath49 is the typical distribution of the conditional wave function arising from a fixed microcanonical wave function of a system in contact with a heat bath . in section  [ sec : rem ]",
    "we discuss other measures that have been or might be considered as the thermal equilibrium distribution of the wave function .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : two ] we compute explicitly the distribution of the coefficients of a @xmath49-distributed state vector in the simplest possible example , the two - level system .",
    "in this section , we define , for any given density matrix @xmath0 on a ( separable ) hilbert space @xmath79 the gaussian adjusted projected measure @xmath3 on @xmath7",
    ". this definition makes use of two auxiliary measures , @xmath45 and @xmath80 , defined as follows .",
    "@xmath45 is the gaussian measure on @xmath2 with covariance matrix @xmath0 ( and mean 0 ) .",
    "more explicitly , let @xmath81 be an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors of @xmath0 and @xmath82 the corresponding eigenvalues , @xmath83 such a basis exists because @xmath0 has finite trace .",
    "let @xmath84 be a sequence of independent complex - valued random variables having a ( rotationally symmetric ) gaussian distribution in @xmath85 with mean @xmath86 and variance @xmath87 ( where @xmath88 means expectation ) , i.e. , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are independent real gaussian variables with mean zero and variance @xmath91 .",
    "we define @xmath45 to be the distribution of the random vector @xmath92 note that @xmath93 is not normalized , i.e. , it does not lie in @xmath7 . in order that @xmath93 lie in @xmath2 at all , we need that the sequence @xmath84 be square - summable",
    ", @xmath94 is finite .",
    "in fact , @xmath95 more generally , we observe that for any measure @xmath1 on @xmath2 with ( mean 0 and ) covariance given by the trace class operator @xmath96 , @xmath97 we have that , for a random vector @xmath36 with distribution @xmath1 , @xmath98 .",
    "it also follows that @xmath93 almost surely lies in the positive spectral subspace of @xmath0 , the closed subspace spanned by those @xmath26 with @xmath99 , or , equivalently , the orthogonal complement of the kernel of @xmath0 ; we shall call this subspace @xmath100 .",
    "note further that , since @xmath45 is the gaussian measure with covariance @xmath0 , it does not depend ( in the case of degenerate @xmath0 ) on the choice of the basis @xmath101 among the eigenbases of @xmath0 , but only on @xmath0 .",
    "since we want a measure on @xmath7 while @xmath45 is not concentrated on @xmath7 but rather is spread out , it would be natural to project @xmath45 to @xmath7 .",
    "however , since projecting to @xmath7 changes the covariance of a measure , as we will point out in detail in section [ sec : densitymatrix ] , we introduce an adjustment factor that exactly compensates for the change of covariance due to projection .",
    "we thus define the adjusted gaussian measure @xmath80 on @xmath2 by @xmath102 since @xmath103 by , @xmath80 is a probability measure",
    ".    let @xmath104 be a @xmath80-distributed random vector .",
    "we define @xmath3 to be the distribution of @xmath105 with @xmath106 the projection to the unit sphere ( i.e. , the normalization of a vector ) , @xmath107 putting differently , for a subset @xmath108 , @xmath109 where @xmath110 denotes the cone through @xmath111 . more succinctly , @xmath112 where @xmath113 denotes the action of @xmath106 on measures .",
    "more generally , one can define for any measure @xmath1 on @xmath2 the `` adjust - and - project '' procedure : let @xmath114 be the adjusted measure @xmath115 ; then the adjusted - and - projected measure is @xmath116 , thus defining a mapping @xmath117 from the measures on @xmath2 with @xmath118 to the probability measures on @xmath7 .",

    "for any density matrix @xmath0 on @xmath52 that does not have zero among its eigenvalues , there is an @xmath474 such that @xmath475 for @xmath476 , and thus we have that @xmath453 for such a @xmath0 ; since these are dense , we have that @xmath453 for all density matrices @xmath0 on @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath52 is arbitrary we are done .",
    "markov processes in hilbert space have long been considered ( see @xcite for an overview ) , particularly diffusion processes and piecewise deterministic ( jump ) processes .",
    "this is often done for the purpose of numerical simulation of a master equation for the density matrix , or as a model of continuous measurement or of spontaneous wave function collapse .",
    "such processes could arise as follows .",
    "since the conditional wave function @xmath62 arises from the wave function @xmath56 by inserting a random coordinate @xmath227 for the second variable ( and normalizing ) , any dynamics ( i.e. , time evolution ) for @xmath227 , described by a curve @xmath477 and preserving the quantum probability distribution of @xmath227 , for example , as given by bohmian mechanics @xcite , gives rise to a dynamics for the conditional wave function , @xmath478 , where @xmath479 evolves according to schrdinger s equation and @xmath480 is the normalizing factor . in this way one obtains a stochastic process ( a random path ) in @xmath64 . in the case considered in section  [ sec : hb1 ] , in which @xmath54 corresponds to a large heat bath , this process must have @xmath481 as an invariant measure .",
    "it would be interesting to know whether this process is approximately a simple process in @xmath64 , perhaps a diffusion process , perhaps one of the markov processes on hilbert space considered already in the literature .",
    "in this last section , we consider a two - level system , with @xmath482 and @xmath483 and calculate the joint distribution of the energy coefficients @xmath484 and @xmath485 for a @xmath486-distributed @xmath36 as explicitly as possible .",
    "we begin with a general finite - dimensional system , @xmath487 , and specialize to @xmath488 later .",
    "one way of describing the distribution of @xmath36 is to give its density relative to the hypersurface area measure @xmath128 on @xmath489 ; this we did in .",
    "another way of describing the joint distribution of the @xmath84 is to describe the joint distribution of their moduli @xmath199 , or of @xmath490 , as the phases of the @xmath84 are independent ( of each other and of the moduli ) and uniformly distributed , see .      for greater clarity , from now on",
    "we write @xmath495 instead of @xmath84 .",
    "a relation similar to that between @xmath3 , @xmath80 , and @xmath45 holds between the joint distributions of the @xmath496 , of the @xmath497 , and of the @xmath498 .",
    "the joint distribution of the @xmath498 is very simple : they are independent and exponentially distributed with means @xmath499 . since the density of @xmath500 relative to @xmath501 , @xmath502 , is a function of the moduli alone , and since , according to , @xmath503 , we have that @xmath504 thus , @xmath505 where each @xmath506",
    ". finally , the @xmath496 arise by normalization , @xmath507    we now specialize to the two - level system , @xmath488 .",
    "since @xmath508 , it suffices to determine the distribution of @xmath509 , for which we give an explicit formula in below .",
    "we want to obtain the marginal distribution of from the joint distribution of the @xmath497 in @xmath510 , the first quadrant of the plane , as given by . to this end",
    ", we introduce new coordinates in the first quadrant : @xmath511where @xmath512 and @xmath513 .",
    "conversely , we have @xmath514 and @xmath515 , and the area element transforms according to @xmath516        with @xmath519 and @xmath520 for @xmath521 . the density @xmath522 of the distribution of @xmath509 is depicted in figure  1 for various values of @xmath24 . for @xmath523 , @xmath522 is identically 1 . for @xmath524 , we have @xmath525 , so that @xmath526 is decreasing monotonically from @xmath527 at @xmath528 to @xmath529 at @xmath530 ; hence , @xmath522 is increasing monotonically from @xmath531 to @xmath532 . for @xmath533 , we have @xmath534 , and hence @xmath522 is decreasing monotonically from @xmath531 to @xmath532 . in all cases",
