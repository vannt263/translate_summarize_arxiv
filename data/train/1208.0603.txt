    "in relativistic heavy - ion collisions a large number of charged particles is produced throughout the dynamical evolution of the system . while this is readily evident from measurements of the hadronic spectra in the final state of the evolution , the spectra provide only little insight into how and when the production of charged particles occurs .",
    "in contrast measurements of charged particle correlations contain additional information about the evolution of the system and several observables have been proposed to study in particular the chemical evolution of the system @xcite . in this context",
    "it is important to realize , that charged particle production is subject to microscopic conservation laws , which require local production of charge anti - charge pairs in coordinate space .",
    "the strong collective expansion of the system transforms these correlations from coordinate space to momentum space , while at the same time diffusive interactions with the medium reduce the correlations @xcite .",
    "charge balance correlations therefore contain important information on the creation mechanisms of charged particles and their subsequent evolution .",
    "+   + in the literature it is usually assumed that charge production happens at two different stages of the evolution @xcite . the first wave of production is expected to occur during the first fm/@xmath0 of the collision by initial hard scatterings and during the thermalization process to form the quark - gluon plasma phase . after a collective expansion of the system , a second stage of charge production is expected during the transition from the deconfined qgp phase to hadronic matter around @xmath1 @xmath2 .",
    "the quark anti - quark pairs produced early in the collision are subject to diffusion over a large period of time and one expects the correlation of balancing partners to be significantly reduced in the final state . in",
    "contrast charge anti - charge pairs which are produced at times close to the kinetic freeze - out of the system exhibit diffusion only over a short period of time , and one expects a strong final state correlation .",
    "charge balance correlations are therefore sensitive to the production time of charges as well as the transport properties of the medium .",
    "while it is an ongoing effort to disentangle the different effects @xcite , we will study here to what extent experimental observations at the lhc are consistent with highly localized charge conservation at kinetic freeze - out .",
    "we will compare results from a statistical freeze - out model which takes into account local charge conservation at freeze - out @xcite to present lhc data @xcite and provide predictions in cases where observables have not yet been measured .",

    "we can investigate not only the separation width of the balancing charge but also its variation with respect to the event plane , which is sensitive to the flow properties of charged particle pairs .",
    "one of the correlations we investigate , @xmath20 , has originally been proposed in the search of experimental signatures of the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) @xcite . in measurements of the star and alice experiments @xcite , it was found that this correlation shows a strong charge dependence which has been argued to be consistent to the cme @xcite .",
    "however the combined effects of local charge conservation and elliptic flow have been shown to account for the charge dependence of the signal observed at rhic @xcite .",

    "we also provided predictions for additional correlators to test this alternative explanation of the signal .",
    "we emphasize that the notion of local charge conservation at kinetic freeze - out is an interesting observation by itself .",
    "this is because the correlations of balancing charges in the final state are directly related to the chemical evolution of the plasma as well as the transport properties of the medium .",
    "the key challenge is to identify the origin of local charge conservation at freeze - out which can be explained by small in - medium diffusion of quarks produced in the early stage of the evolution as well as by a different production mechanism where charged particles are predominantly produced at late times . in this context",
    "it was pointed out that balance functions of identified charged particles provide a promising tool to disentangle hadronic and partonic contributions @xcite and one should also take into account the recent results of direct photon measurements , which point to strong collective behavior early in the collision @xcite . finally it would be interesting to study the effects of local charge conservation in event - by - event simulations and possibly also within a microscopic approach .",
