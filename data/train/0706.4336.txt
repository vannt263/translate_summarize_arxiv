    "we emphasize that , in this study , we do _ not _ attempt to investigate the physical origin of the gas , i.e. whether it is bound to satellite dark matter halos , infalling or being ejected out of the galaxy via winds .",
    "we consider a case in which the total mass density ( baryonic and dark matter ) for such a system is described by an isothermal profile : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the velocity dispersion , @xmath39 the virial radius , and @xmath40 is the density .",
    "the mass within a given radius @xmath41 is then given by @xmath42 and by definition , the density enclosed within the virial radius is 200 times the critical density . according to fukugita & peebles ( 2006 ) ,",

    "we note that once the function @xmath61 has been normalized at 50 kpc , the cloud - distribution of systems introduced above automatically reproduces the drop of the covering factor for absorption and allows absorbing clouds to be found on scales @xmath62100kpc , as indicated by recent studies .",

    "we simplify the calculations by assuming a slab geometry with one surface of the cloud exposed to half of the total ionizing flux .",

    "constraining the parameter range relevant to strong absorbers is not straightforward since strong  lines are usually saturated and additional observational constraints are needed to estimate their typical density and column density .",

    "2006 ) . using the rest equivalent width as a proxy for the column density along the line - of - sight ( see eq .",
    "[ eq_propto ] ) we see from fig . [ rao ] that a typical cloud has an  column density of @xmath73 , implying a density of about @xmath74 .",

    " all of which are beyond the scope of this paper and are not observationally motivated at this stage . in the absence of a clear physical motivation , we attempt to take this effect into account by introducing a distribution of cloud sizes ( as implied by the observations ;  2.1 ) . here , clouds have similar densities which allow them to be in pressure equilibrium with their environment .",
    "( we find the alternative scenario in which all clouds have the same size but different densities less plausible since the implied evaporation times would be embarrassingly short compared to the hubble time ; see appendix . ) to this end we assume that the size of individual mgii clouds is drawn from an intrinsic distribution @xmath77 so that observed one ( taking into account cloud cross - section effects on the detectability rates ) @xmath78 .",

    "this implies that the presence of a quasar can be used to shed light on the distribution of matter in the halos of galaxies .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to construct a model which unifies several distinct astrophysical phenomena pertaining to intervening absorption , associated absorption , and quasar emission nebulae . in our model , these phenomena are different manifestations of the same physical entity , that being of cool gas condensations distributed within the halo of galaxies . if our model is correct then the properties of cool gas in the vicinity of galaxies may be revealed by studying the influence of an active nucleus on its thermal and ionization structure . in particular , the study of associated absorption may help to constrain the density and distance of halo gas from the quasar .",
    "cool gas around galaxies is notoriously difficult to detect in emission .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of an ionizing source enhances emission and renders the detection of circum - galactic material more accessible .",
    "furthermore , by studying the nebulosities around quasars , one can obtain a 2d - spatial@xmath2161d - velocity picture of the gas .",
    "mean quantities pertaining to the mass of the gas and its metallicity can be more easily deduced for individual objects .",
    "in addition to shedding light on gas distribution in the halos of galaxies , it is possible to deduce important conclusions about quasar physics : the recent results by bowen et al .",
    "( 2006 , 2007 ) indicate a covering factor of order unity for cool gas in the transverse direction around quasars in contrast to the much lower covering factor for associated  absorption .",
    "our model implies that this is merely a consequence of the quasar unification scheme : gas in the radial direction to the quasar is heated to high temperatures while that which is at right angles to the quasar ionization cone remains unaffected .",
    "this is not a trivial result since , although the unification scheme is well established for active galactic nuclei , it is less secure for bright quasars at high-@xmath192 .",
    "further tests of this conjecture may be carried out by comparing model predictions to the occurrence of associated absorbers for a wide range of ionization levels as well as by studying emission line nebulae in detail .",
    "our model can reproduce the emission and absorption properties of quasars by requiring quasar halos to be more extended and therefore more massive than those of @xmath0 galaxies ( c.f .",

    "such a scaling combined with the radiation properties of quasars can simultaneously explain the anisotropic absorption properties and the ly@xmath8 nebulae observed on scales reaching @xmath13100 kpc . finally , if the correlation found between the size of cool gaseous halos and galaxy luminosity ( steidel et al . 1997 ,",
    "guillemin & bergeron 1997 ) can be extended to quasars then this implies that quasar hosts are a few@xmath123 , which is in agreement with results from jahnke et al .",

    "better understanding of quasar emission line nebulae may allow us to deduce the long - term light - curve behavior of quasars .",
    "this will require better understanding of the matter distribution in quasar halos which can be achieved by deep imaging and spatially resolved spectroscopy of quasar environments .",
    "the detection of orphan nebulae ( where the active nucleus is obscure ) may provide a new means for identifying type - ii quasars .",
    "combining large samples of emitting and absorbing gaseous nebulae may allow us to statistically constrain the mass of cool gas in quasar halos as well as the opening angle of quasars .",
    "this has implications for re - ionization and background radiation determination .",
    "a survey of emission line nebulae around a large number of quasars may also reveal environmental differences among quasar types ( e.g. , the rqq - rlq dichotomy ) .",
    "the detection of metal emission lines , whose presence ( depending on the gas composition ) is predicted by our model , may allow to estimate the metallicity of gas in the halo and test models for metal enrichment of galaxies and the inter - galactic / intra - cluster medium .",
    "we have presented a phenomenological model for the distribution of cool gas around @xmath0 galaxies , calibrated with a wide range of observational constraints from absorption line studies ( rest equivalent width distribution of  absorbers , hi column density , etc . ) .",
    "we argue that the halos of @xmath0 galaxies are filled with gaseous clouds with sizes of order 1kpc , masses of @xmath217 and particle densities @xmath218 .",
    "the total amount of cool gas within the virial radius of @xmath0 galaxies depends on the covering factor for strong absorption ( which is a matter of debate ) and is likely to be in the range @xmath219 , within the virial radius .    by assuming self - similarity ,",
    "we show that the obtained solution for the distribution of cool gas around galaxies , if appropriately scaled , can reproduce the properties of cool gas seen quasars .",

    "we describe the time - dependent ionization and thermal structure of an initially cool cloud which is exposed to a quasar s ionizing radiation . as the quasar phenomenon is short lived compared to the hubble time ( the quasar lifetime , @xmath220years ; e.g. , worseck & wisotzki 2006 ) , it is instructive to first consider a few relevant timescales of the problem :    * the dynamical timescale of a halo of size @xmath221 at a virial temperature , @xmath222 ( corresponding to some sound speed , @xmath223 ) is @xmath224 * the sound crossing timescale for a cloud of size @xmath225 at temperature @xmath226 is @xmath227 * the photoionization timescale for ion @xmath228 is @xmath229 where @xmath230 is the cross - section , @xmath231 the energy , @xmath232 the flux per unit energy , @xmath41 the distance from the quasar .",
    "we assumed a mean ionizing photon energy of @xmath233ev and an ionization cross - section of @xmath234 ( roughly that of ) . *",
    "the recombination timescale for ion @xmath228 is @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the number density of atoms and @xmath237 the recombination coefficient ( taking only the radiative term for ) .",
    "the photoionization and recombination timescales are the shortest in the problem .",
    "the cloud and halo dynamical timescales ( approximated by the sound - crossing time ) are probably longer than the quasar lifetime , @xmath238 ; hence , while the ionization structure of the clouds can vary rapidly ( see below ) , the structure of the halo and embedded clouds remains approximately constant during the quasar lifetime .",
    "we note , however , that the sound - crossing timescale for the smallest clouds in our model could be as short as @xmath239years if their temperature rises to high values once the quasar activates .",
    "we choose to ignore this complication here since ( a ) the quasar lifetime is poorly known and ( b ) the evaporation timescale is a few times the sound - crossing timescale ( e.g. , bertoldi 1989 ) .",
    "also , due to the spectrum of the cloud s size - distribution , the evaporation of the smallest clouds will make little difference to our final conclusions .",
    "in addition to the above analytic approximations , we have numerically computed several time - dependent photoionization and thermal models .",
    "this is necessary to quantify just how important the effects of the varying quasar flux are compared to time independent calculations and to see which ions are affected most . the algorithm used for these calculations is fully described in gnat & sternberg ( 2006 ) .    at the beginning of the calculation",
    "we assume that the cloud is exposed to the meta - galactic field and is in ionization and thermal equilibrium .",
    "we then turn on a quasar and assume a step function description for its light curve , i.e. , the quasar if off for @xmath240 and on at @xmath241 .",
    "the quasar is assumed to maintain a constant flux level to @xmath242 .",
    "the calculations are carried out under isochoric conditions , as appropriate given the above considerations .",
    "the thermal calculations are shown in fig .",
    "[ orly ] for the case of @xmath128 , and demonstrate the limitations of the assumption of photoionization and thermal equilibrium .",
    "the gas heats up very quickly near the quasar where the ionizing flux is high and less so on larger scales .",
    "typically , the gas within the inner 50kpc heats up to @xmath243k over a period of @xmath4 years ( cf .",
    "equations a3,a4 ) .",
    "further heating occurs on somewhat longer timescales which can be comparable to the quasar lifetime . unless one happens to intercept young quasars then the inner @xmath244kpc region of the halo would be heated to @xmath245k over the quasar lifetime .",
    "we conclude that , for moderate luminosity quasars , the gas in the central regions of the haloes can be efficiently heated to @xmath245k .",
    "nevertheless , further heating is delayed and may take longer than the quasar duty - cycle or other relevant dynamical timescales of the problem .",
    "assuming @xmath238 is similar for all quasars then higher temperatures can be reached in the inner regions of the haloes of bright quasars since the ionization timescale is shorter and the flux higher .",
    "we have also calculated the time - dependent ionization structure of the halo and trace several of the ionization levels in fig .",
    "as shown , all the low ionization stages usually probed by absorption line studies quickly attain negligible abundances and are not likely to be observed unless the quasar brightened over short timescales .",
    "for example ,  and  would be immediately ionized and the gas is quickly heated .",
    "time - dependent ionization deviations from a steady - state solution can be important but mainly for the high ionization levels whose absorption lines would appear in the x - ray region of the quasar spectrum .",
    "the above analysis suggests that it may be possible to treat the halos of quasars as having the same structure as galaxy halos since little structural changes are likely to occur over the quasar lifetime by radiation effects alone .",
    "we note that this is may not be the case if quasar activity is a recurring phenomenon or if they have additional means of affecting their environment ( e.g. , via jets , winds , etc . ) . to conclude , for the purpose of this work , steady - state photoionization calculations can be adequately used to describe the ionization and thermal state of the halo gas at all times ."
