    "time - delayed feedback was originally proposed in the context of chaos control @xcite as an alternative to the famous ogy method developed earlier by @xcite .",
    "the idea was to achieve stabilization of unstable periodic orbits ( upos ) by adding , to a chaotic system , a control force in the form of the difference between a system variable at time @xmath0 and at a delayed time @xmath1 .",
    "this method proved to be very powerful and has been successfully applied to various physical systems since then @xcite .",
    "the scheme was improved by @xcite , and other variants have been elaborated @xcite , and applied also to stochastic systems @xcite . moreover ,",
    "elegant analytical theories @xcite were developed supporting , thus , numerical findings .",
    "apart from the practically relevant application of time - delayed feedback , e.g. to lasers @xcite , the interest lies highly on the mathematical aspect of the problem .",
    "delay differential equations are difficult to handle .",
    "the delay renders the system infinite - dimensional and the interplay with nonlinearity uncovers complex dynamic behaviour .",
    "delay - induced multistability was already predicted in the first paper by @xcite .",
    "the idea that time - delayed feedback may not only be used for controlling a system but also for creating new dynamics is not new .",
    "nevertheless , the investigation of delay - induced bifurcations and multistability is still a growing field @xcite with applications to the logistic map as well as to laser equations @xcite .",
    "here we study the influence of time - delayed feedback in a generic model representative for excitable dynamics @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the system without delay is governed by a global bifurcation , namely a saddle - node bifurcation on a limit cycle ( _ saddle - node infinite period bifurcation , sniper _ ) , that takes place when a certain parameter exceeds a threshold .",
    "such a bifurcation was first observed experimentally in a semiconductor device @xcite , and also encountered in various semiconductor models , e.g. for gunn domains @xcite , superlattices @xcite , or lasers @xcite .",
    "excitability , naturally , yields the system highly sensitive to fluctuations and therefore this system has served perfectly as an example for _ coherence resonance _",
    "@xcite shown in the seminal paper by @xcite and @xcite over ten years ago . in this paper",
    "we do not consider the effect of noise but extend the generic model by incorporating time - delayed feedback according to the pyragas scheme .",
    "the equations are the following :    @xmath2    here @xmath3 and @xmath4 denote the variables at time @xmath0 , while @xmath5 and @xmath6 the delayed ones at time @xmath1 , with @xmath7 and @xmath8 being the delay and control strength , respectively .",
    "this kind of control is called _ diagonal _ because the control force may be written in the form of a unity matrix . in the absence of delay , i.e.  @xmath9 , @xmath10 plays the role of the bifurcation paramater . in polar",
    "coordinates @xmath11 eq .",

    "the latter collide at @xmath16 and a limit cycle @xmath17 is born . above but close to the bifurcation , the frequency @xmath18 of this limit cycle obeys a characteristic square - root scaling law @xmath19 .",
    "we prepare the system slightly below the bifurcation ( @xmath20 ) and switch on the control . the first question that arises concerns the stability of the three fixed points and how this changes , or not , due to delay . for this",
    ", we perform a standard linear stability analysis and derive the characteristic equation for the roots , @xmath21 , which determine the stability of the fixed points . for the unstable focus ,",
    "the characteristic equations is :    @xmath22    due to the presence of the delay , eq .",
    "( [ eq : char_poly_ufo ] ) has infinitely many solutions .",
    "however , the stability of the fixed points is determined by a finite number of critical roots with largest real parts . using the lambert function @xmath23 , which is defined as the inverse function of @xmath24 for complex @xmath25 @xcite , the solution of eq .",

    "figure  [ fig : real_eigen_vs_tau ] shows the real parts of the eigenvalues @xmath21 as a function of @xmath7 for a fixed value of @xmath8 for all three fixed points .",
    "one may see the eigenvalues of the uncontrolled system at @xmath31 , and their interaction with the delay - induced modes ( blue ) with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "in all three cases , control is unable to change the stability of the fixed point : in the case of the unstable focus , the mode with the largest real part ( red ) tends to very small values with increasing delay , remaining however positive .",
    "the same holds for the unstable mode of the saddle .",
    "symmetric behaviour is observed for the stable modes of both saddle and node : they tend to zero as a function of @xmath7 but remain negative .",
    "the picture does not change qualitatively even for other values of @xmath8 and therefore one might conclude that no delay - induced bifurcations of fixed points take place .     as a function of @xmath7 , for fixed @xmath32 and @xmath20 .",
    "for the ( a ) unstable focus , ( b ) the saddle point and ( c ) the stable node .",
    "the modes emerging from the uncontrolled system and the delay - induced modes are marked red and blue , respectively . ]",
    "however , the above local analysis gives no information on the global changes in phase space that delay potentially induces .",
    "a numerical investigation shows , in fact , that there exists bistability in a certain parameter regime in the @xmath8-@xmath7 plane : trajectories starting close to the saddle point are attracted by a delay - induced limit cycle , whereas trajectories starting elsewhere end up in the stable node . keeping @xmath33 fixed we find the critical value @xmath34 of @xmath8 for which this delay - induced limit cycle is born and observe a scaling @xmath35 in the period @xmath36 of the corresponding oscillations , typical for the case of a homoclinic bifurcation . in fig .",
    "[ fig : hom_scaling_law ] phase portraits of the system below , at and above the bifurcation are shown .",
    "trajectories with different initial conditions are shown : one starting from the vicinity of the unstable focus in the origin ( blue ) and one from the vicinity of the saddle ( red ) .",
    "bistability is revealed in fig .",
    "[ fig : hom_scaling_law](c ) where two attractors ( the stable node and the delay - induced limit cycle ) coexist .",
    "the kink in the trajectory shortly before the loop closes is due to the control : the control force starts acting at @xmath37 when the system is still moving on the slow part of the unit circle .",
    "therefore , its effect is not so noticeable .",
    "as the system moves faster the control force attains higher values and the trajectory starts deviating from its deterministic path at @xmath38 .",
    "this deviation becomes large at @xmath39 where the trajectory , shortly before settling in the stable node , appears to be `` attracted '' to the saddle , resulting in this kink in the @xmath40 projection .",
    "also , as @xmath8 approaches the critical value , the trajectory passes closer and closer to the saddle on its way to the stable node .",
    "this ends in a homoclinic orbit at @xmath41 , ( fig .",

    "[ fig : hom_branch ] ( left ) .",
    "it consists of two main curves : one running through points @xmath49 and a second tongue - like curve . in the white area",

    "a - e labels various points with homoclinic orbits , which are shown in the @xmath40 phase plane in the panel on the right .",
    "delay - induced limit cycles exist , in addition to the stable fixed point , in the yellow area .",
    "the blue dashed curve separates the regions @xmath50 ( left ) and @xmath51 ( right ) ]     of the saddle for two points on the homoclinic bifurcation line : ( a ) @xmath52 , @xmath7=3 ( b in fig .",
    "[ fig : hom_branch ] ) and ( b ) * @xmath53 , @xmath54 * ( e in fig .",
    "[ fig : hom_branch ] ) .",
    "the saddle quantity @xmath55 is negative in ( a ) whereas in ( b ) it is positive . ( @xmath20 ) ]    at this point one should emphasize the role of the saddle - point : due to the delay , the saddle possesses no longer two distinct eigenvalues ( one positive , i.e.  unstable , and one negative , i.e.   stable ) but infinitely many .",
    "moereover , complex eigenvalues come into play as well .",
    "the eigenvalues , however , that determine the behaviour of the colliding homoclinic orbit , are the leading ones , i.e.   those closest to the imaginary axis . in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] one can see the eigenvalue spectrum for two parameter values on the homoclinic curve and notice that the leading eigenvalues of the saddle ( red ) are a positive real eigenvalue , as in the original uncontrolled system , and a complex conjugate pair with negative real parts , generated by the delay .",
    "this means that the saddle may turn into a _",
    "saddle - focus _ for certain values of @xmath8 and @xmath7 .",
    "homoclinic orbits attached to a saddle - focus approach the fixed point in an oscillating manner .",

    "@xmath20 ]    from the above , it is clear that the two basic ingredients responsible for the delay - induced dynamics in our system are the homoclinic orbits and the saddle - foci . the theory of homoclinic bifurcations for ordinary differential equations has been well developed @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , global bifurcations are strongly related to excitability and therefore one expects to encounter them in excitable systems .",
    "various physical systems such as modulation - doped semiconductor heterostructures @xcite , semiconductor lasers @xcite , neuron models @xcite and chemical systems @xcite have been studied in this respect , both theoretically and experimentally . on the other hand , less",
    "work has been carried out for systems with delay undergoing such nonlocal bifurcations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to analyze a generic system like the one studied here which , despite its simplicity , exhibits rich delay - induced dynamics with a homoclinic bifurcation as key component .",
    "in what follows we will apply the theorems on homoclinic orbits connecting to saddle - foci as developed by shilnikov @xcite . according to them ,",
    "the so - salled saddle quantity is crucial for the homoclinic bifurcations occurring in high - dimensional systems .",
    "the saddle quantity is defined as @xmath55 , where @xmath62 and @xmath43 are the leading stable and unstable eigenvalues , respectively .",
    "shilnikov proved , among other , that negative @xmath63 results in the birth of a unique stable limit cycle from a homoclinic orbit . on the other hand , for @xmath51 , a wide variety of homoclinic bifurcations may occur , some of which involve infinitely many periodic orbits in the vicinity of the homoclinic orbit .",
    "the green dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : hom_branch ] shows the condition @xmath64 . along the homoclinic bifurcation line in fig .",
    "[ fig : hom_branch ] the saddle quantity changes sign , thereby allowing for both scenarios to take place .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the eigenvalue spectra for two different points on the bifurcation line corresponding to negative and positive saddle quantities , respectively .    in the following ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to a fixed value of @xmath65 and reveal multistability beyond the homoclinic bifurcation . for @xmath65 ,",
    "a homoclinic bifurcation takes place at @xmath66 ( point a in fig .",
    "[ fig : hom_branch ] ) . in this case @xmath67 , and the bifurcation creates one stable limit cycle , with floquet multipliers within the unit circle ( inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : tau7](a ) ) .",
    "the period @xmath36 of this limit cycle increases monotonically as the bifurcation point is approached ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tau7](a ) ) . moving further along @xmath65 other homoclinic bifurcation curves are crossed , e.g.  at @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tau7](b ) , cf .",
    "point z in fig .",
    "[ fig : hom_branch ] ) .",
    "there , the saddle quantity is positive ( @xmath68 , calculated analytically from eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambert_node ] ) ) , and the picture is much more complicated : an infinite number of bifurcations take place , which are related to saddle - node ( fold ) bifurcations of pairs of stable and unstable limit cycles , and additional period - doubling ( flip ) bifurcations of the stable limit cycles . the dependence of the period @xmath36 of the limit cycles upon @xmath8 is a nonmonotonic multivalued function , whose turning points are associated with saddle - node bifurcations . in between the fold bifurcations of the stable limit cycles , pairs of forward and inverse period doubling bifurcations occur . in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : tau7 ] the trivial floquet multiplier @xmath60 and the leading floquet multiplier @xmath61 of the periodic orbit are plotted .",
    "it can be seen how @xmath61 changes as @xmath36 is varied along the multivalued function in the main figure , showing how fold and flip bifurcations occur , at @xmath60 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "one should also expect other bifurcations near the critical point due to secondary homoclinic orbits which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a mechanism for delay - induced multistability in a system near a global bifurcation .",
    "in addition to the fixed point attractor which the uncontrolled system already possesses , a time - delayed feedback in the form of pyragas difference control induces one or more coexisting limit cycle attractors . depending upon the feedback control strength @xmath8 and the delay time @xmath7 , either a single stable limit cycle is born in a homoclinic global bifurcation , or an infinite number of ( stable and unstable ) periodic orbits",
    "is induced undergoing a rich menagerie of bifurcation scenarios including period doubling and fold bifurcations .",
    "we have shown that the key ingredient in the observed dynamics is a homoclinic orbit connected to a saddle - focus created by delay . a bifurcation continuation in the @xmath48 plane",
    "was performed .",
    "moreover , we were able to verify shilnikov s theory of homoclinic bifurcations in a certain parameter regime .",
    "the excitable nature of the system and the infinite - dimensional phase space , due to delay , appear to play a crucial role in the induced homoclinicity .",
    "these results are interesting also from the point of view of applications , since our generic model is representative for a wide range of real - world systems .",
    "for instance , the transition from stationary to moving field domains in semiconductor superlattices has been shown to be associated with a saddle - node bifurcation on a limit cycle as described by eq.([eq : model ] ) at @xmath9 @xcite , and time - delayed feedback control can also be realized in this system @xcite . already without delay ,",
    "this system has been noted for its high multistability of stationary domain states @xcite , and bistability or higher multistability has been found in many other semiconductor nanostructures , see e.g. @xcite ."
