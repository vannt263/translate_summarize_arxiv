    "the coherent bit ( cobit ) with discrete variables ( dv ) proposed by aram harrow @xcite is a powerful resource intermediate between a quantum bit ( qubit ) and a classical bit ( cbit ) .",
    "a cobit communication between two parties with dv performs the following map : @xmath0 . for example , if alice possesses a arbitrary qubit @xmath1 and sends it through a cobit channel , the cobit channel generates the state @xmath2 .",
    "the cobit channel in two parties maintains the coherent superpositions of alice s input state , this is the root of the channel s name interpreted by harrow @xcite . in @xcite , wilde and brun interpreted and analyzed the differences and connections among classical communication , quantum communication , entanglement and cobit channel .",
    "recently , wilde , krovi , and brun extended the cobit channel from discrete variables to continuous variables ( cv ) and introduced the concept of `` conat channel '' @xcite as the cv counterpart of the dv `` cobit channel '' .",
    "wilde and brun gave the definitions of the ideal position - quadrature ( pq ) conat channel and momentum - qudrature ( mq ) conat channel in the schroedinger - picture , as the following map @xmath3 , @xmath4 represents position eigenstate or momentum eigenstate respectively .",
    "nonideal ( finitely squeezed ) conat channels are also discussed in the heisenberg picture .",
    "the coherent channel provides for coherent communication .",
    "coherent communication has several useful characteristics and applications .",
    "it provides coherent versions of continuous - variable teleportation and continuous - variable superdense coding , moreover they are dual under resource reversal @xcite .",
    "also , it can be applied in remote preparation ( rsp ) consuming less entanglement than standard ones @xcite .",
    "coherent communication also can be used in error correcting codes @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we extend the notion of conat channel to multiple parties that can perform multiparty coherent communication . also , we construct two methods to implement it with linear optics and we analyze the noise accumulation in different prepared epr @xcite resources .",
    "multiparty conat channel has all the useful properties of the bipartite conat channel , we propose some new applications of multiparty conat channel in controlled communication and quantum secret sharing ( qss ) .",
    "insights into the conat channel occur by detecting one quadrature of alice s modes and replacing bob s respective quadrature , finally bob can extract the transmitted message , which will be highlighted in our protocols later .    our paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we provide a general definition of multiparty position - quadrature ( pq ) conat channel and multiparty momentum - qudrature ( mq ) conat channel in heisenberg representation . in section 3 , two implementations of the protocol using realistic linear optical devices",
    "are outlined . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the applications of our protocol .",
    "finally , a brief conclusion is given in section 5 .",
    "we provide a general definition of multiparty position - quadrature ( pq ) conat channel and multiparty momentum - qudrature ( mq ) conat channel in heisenberg representation .",
    "the channel has only one sender alice and _",
    "n _ receivers alice , bob , charlie @xmath5 and nick .",
    "notice that the sender is also among the receivers .",
    "the multiparty pq conat channel @xmath6 copies the position quadrature of the sender to all the involving receivers with respective noise .",
    "the resulting multimode state is similar to multiparty ghz @xcite entanglement .",
    "the difference is that the total momentum of the output modes is close to the original momentum of the sender @xmath7 , encoding the transmitted message into all the receivers involved in this channel , while the total momentum of ghz entanglement is zero .",
    "the multiparty mq conat channel is defined similarly .",
    "definition 1 : the mapping of a multiparty pq conat channel @xmath6 is presented as follows and the constraints of the channel are also given as well .",

    "alice is the sender and also among the receivers",
    ". the constraints of position quadratures in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) indicate that alice s position quadrature remains unchanged , and alice s position quadrature copies to the position quadratures of the other receivers with the additional noise @xmath12 , @xmath13",
    "@xmath5 @xmath14 respectively . the conditions of momentum quadratures in ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) ensure that the total momentum is close to alice s original momentum with a noise @xmath15 .",
    "the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xmath5 and @xmath18 in ( 3 ) determine the performance of channel by bounding the noises presented .",
    "definition 2 : the definition for a multiparty mq conat channel is similar to definition 1 . we present it as follows .",
    "mapping : @xmath19^{t}\\rightarrow[\\hat{x}_{a'}\\ \\hat{p}_{a'}\\ \\hat{x}_{b'}\\ \\hat{p}_{b'}\\ \\cdots\\ \\hat{x}_{n'}\\ \\hat{p}_{n'}]^{t}\\ ] ]    constraints : @xmath20 @xmath21 the canonical commutation relations of the heisenberg - picture observables are as follows : @xmath22=[\\hat{x}_{b'},\\hat{p}_{b'}]=\\cdots=[\\hat{x}_{n'},\\hat{p}_{n'}]=i\\ ] ]",
    "in this section , we outline two different methods to implement the multiparty conat channel .",
    "the first way is implemented by the multiparty version of coherent communication assisted by entanglement and classical communication ( ccaecc ) @xcite . the second method is multiparty coherent superdense coding which implements two multiparty coherent channels .",

    "we illustrate these requirements in figure [ fig2 ] which gives the scenarios where _ n _ is equal to 3 .",

    "the ( _ n-1 _ ) epr pairs prepared among the _",

    ", alice sends her mode 3 to bob through a quantum channel , so bob now possesses three modes , mode 3 , 4 and 5 .",
    "then he performs a series of qnd interactions , first qnd interaction in mode 3 , 4 then qnd interaction in mode 4 , 5 finally qnd phase adjust interaction in mode 3 , 5 . in step 3",

    ". modes 3 , 4 are epr pair , and modes 5 , 6 too .",
    "we give figure [ fig4 ] to describe this protocol .",
    ".,width=453 ]    in step 1 , alice performs a series of qnd interactions , firstly qnd interaction in mode 2 , 3 , then qnd phase adjust interaction in mode 1 , 3 , then qnd interaction in mode 2 , 5 , finally qnd phase adjust interaction in mode 1 , 5 . in step 2 , alice sends mode 3 to bob and mode 5 to charlie through quantum channels .",
    "then bob possesses two modes 3 , 4 and charlie possesses modes 5 , 6 .",

    "the resulting modes are given as follows :    @xmath65    as in scenario 1 , the output modes 1 , 3 , 5 perform a three - party mq conat channel and modes 2 , 4 , 6 perform a a three - party pq conat channel .",
    "so two multiparty conat channels are produced in this protocol .",
    "then we discuss the noise of the channels in these two scenarios , we assume that the local qnd interaction is ideal .",
    "so we get that    _ in scenario 1 _ : @xmath66    _ in scenario 2 _ : @xmath67    comparing these two scenarios , we can find that the noise of scenario 2 is lower so it is better .",
    "we reach a conclustion that if the path between one party and alice is longer , then the noise this party get is larger so the noise of this channel is larger . as you see in figure [ fig2 ] , the first graph represents scenario 1 , the second graph represents scenario 2 .",
    "we can see that in scenario 1 , the length of the path between bob and alice is one , and the length of the path between charlie and alice is two .",
    "so charlie get larger noise @xmath68 .",
    "the longer the path between one party and alice , the larger the accumulation of the noise this party gets . in scenario 2 ,",
    "the length of the path between alice and any party is one , there is no accumulation of the noise , so scenario 2 is better . for n - party conat channel , the best prepared entanglement resources",
    "is the rightmost graph in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "in this section , we discuss some new and promising applications of our channel , that is , controlled teleportation and quantum secret sharing based on the significant characteristics of our multiparty conat channel .",
    "controlled teleportation is a very important branch of quantum teleportation . in controlled teleportation ,",
    "a third party ( the supervisor charlie ) is involved , and the fidelity of the teleportation is controlled by this party .",
    "the controlled teleportation of single - qubit is proposed in @xcite , and the m - qubit version is proposed in @xcite .",
    "recently , controlled teleportation of single - mode with continuous variable has been proposed in @xcite . using our multiparty conat channel ,",
    "we can achieve controlled teleportation of both single - mode and two - mode with continuous variables which we will discuss later .",
    "quantum secret sharing ( qss ) is a important branch of quantum cryptography @xcite .",
    "quantum secret sharing was firstly proposed in @xcite .",
    "qss has two branches : qss of classical information @xcite and qss of quantum information @xcite . in 2002 ,",
    "tyc and sanders proposed continuous - variable secret sharing of quantum information @xcite .",
    "the output modes of a multiparty pq conat channel construct a network where not only they are in entanglement but also importantly the original momentum message is divided into _",
    "n _ parties involved and is shared by them .",
    "we firstly apply our channel to multiparty - controlled teleportation of a arbitrary coherent state .",
    "the input party alice can teleport her original state to any one ( expect alice herself ) in the _",
    "n _ output parties with the help of all other ( _ n-1 _ ) output agents . without loss of generality , we take a three - party pq conat channel as a example .",
    "if alice wants to teleport her original state to bob through the three - party pq conat channel , alice and charlie are controllers . without the help of alice and charlie , bob",
    "ca nt obtain the teleported state . unless alice and charlie measure the momentum of their own state and send their measurements to bob through classical channels",
    ", bob can extract the momentum signal after the local displacement of his momentum quadrature by the sum of the measurement values he gets .",
    "since bob s position quadrature is approximately equal to alice s original position qudrature , bob can get the original state that alice wants to teleport and then the teleportation is accomplished . if alice wants to teleport her original state to charlie , the situation is similar .",
    "another point we must mention here , it is senseless for alice to teleport her state to herself , so we do nt discuss this situation here . turning to the _ n_-party controlled teleportation , a ( _ n+1_)-party conat channel is required and the operations of measurements , classical communications and displacements are similar , too .    since the method 2 we presented in section 3 has two input modes possessed by alice , using it we can accomplish a multiparty - controlled teleportation of arbitrary two - mode coherent states including two - mode entanglement .",
    "it might be the coherent - states version of deng s work in @xcite . in this method ,",
    "each party possesses two modes .",
    "one mode is in the output modes of pq conat channel and the other is involved in a mq conat channel .",
    "the reconstruction of the two - mode state is same to the individual pq channel and the individual mq channel .",
    "now , let us introduce the process of quantum secret sharing through a multiparty conat channel .",
    "as we mentioned earlier in this section , qss can be used to share both classical information and quantum information . for sharing a unknown one - mode quantum state",
    ", it is similar to the controlled teleportation of an arbitrary coherent state , the secret state can be recovered for any agent of the channel only when all other agents collaborate . for sharing a unknown two - mode quantum state",
    ", it is similar to the controlled teleportation of an arbitrary two - mode coherent state . for sharing classical information , the classical information for continuous",
    "variable is the measurement value of the operator @xmath69 .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the notion of continuous - variable coherent ( conat ) channel to multiparty and given two definitions of it .",
    "then we propose two implementations of multiparty conat channel using linear optics .",
    "one method is the multiparty version of coherent communication assisted by entanglement and classical communication ( ccaecc ) .",
    "the other is multiparty coherent superdense coding which implements two multiparty coherent channels .",
    "we also discuss the noise of the channel in two scenarios when n is equal to 3 .",
    "finally , we apply our channel to controlled teleportation and quantum secret sharing ( qss ) .",
