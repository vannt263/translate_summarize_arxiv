    "roughly @xmath117 of the total mass is constituted by dark matter , while the average ratio of dark - to - baryonic mass is @xmath118 .",
    "our best - fitting pseudo - isothermal sphere parameterisation for the dark matter halo suggests the dark matter to be concentrated as densely as @xmath119  within a core of radius @xmath120  kpc .",
    "this estimate for the central dark matter density if much higher than the estimate made by @xcite who also parameterise the dark matter halo as a pseudo - isothermal sphere , finding @xmath121  .",
    "the large difference can be mainly attributed to our derived rotation curve which rises steeply at inner radii .",
    "the @xcite rotation curve , based on lower resolution  data , rises much more slowly with radius .",
    "our models require much more dark matter near the centre of the galaxy to produce the observed rotation speeds .",
    "our nfw halo parameterisation for the receding half of the galaxy yields the best - fitting mass model with @xmath122 .",
    "the model produces a total rotation curve that fits both the sharply rising inner portion and the gradually declining outer portion of our derived rotation curve .",
    "the estimated concentration parameter @xmath123 is higher than most of the late - type things galaxies mass modelled by @xcite . in contrast , ngc  1705 has a @xmath84 parameter much lower than all of the things galaxies .",
    "our mass models for the approaching half of ngc  1705 are not as well fitted as those for the receding half .",
    "for both the pseudo - isothermal sphere and nfw halo parameterisations the inner portion of the rotation curve is over - estimated . despite implying a total mass of @xmath124  ,",
    "the models show the dark matter not to dominate the dynamics at all radii . at radii @xmath125",
    "kpc it is the stellar disc that almost completely dominates the gravitational potential .",
    "regarding the radial distribution of dark matter , our pseudo - isothermal sphere model suggests there to be a dark matter core of radius @xmath126  kpc and density @xmath127  .",
    "these parameters are in better agreement with those of @xcite yet still make the dark matter core of the galaxy significantly more dense and compact than other late - type systems ( fig .  [",
    "1705_things_halos ] ) .",
    "the best - fitting nfw halo for the approaching half of the galaxy is similar to that of the receding half - again suggesting a high concentration parameter together with a low @xmath84 .",
    "all of the mass modeling results taken together imply ngc  1705 to contain a lot of dark matter with a dense , compact core .",
    "the extreme density and compactness of the inner halo of ngc  1705 make it comparable to early - type dwarf spheroidals which have typical dark matter core densities of @xmath128  pc@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we have used  synthesis data for ngc  1705 to study the properties of its extended gaseous disc . we have produced high - quality  channel and moment maps .",
    "a total  mass of @xmath129  is estimated from the global  profile .",
    "a rotation curve for the galaxy is derived by fitting a tilted ring model to the  velocity field .",
    "the rotation curve rises steeply near the centre of the galaxy and then levels out to a roughly constant velocity in the outer disc . the galaxy is kinematically lopsided with different asymptotic velocities derived for each side of the  disc .",
    "the  and stellar contributions to the rotation curve are estimated using our new  data together with _",
    "3.6   and galex far - ultraviolet imaging , respectively .",
    "the high spatial resolution of our  data allows the inner  distribution to be resolved into at least two over - densities which straddle the system s extremely luminous central super star cluster , ngc  1705 - 1 .",
    "this star cluster is the main energy source powering a galactic outflow which is revealed in our channel and moment maps as a drawn - out  feature extending from the centre of the galaxy in the same direction as an extended  component .",
    "the structure of the intensity - weighted - mean  velocity field is that of a rotating disc .",
    "the dark matter halo of the galaxy is parameterised as a pseudo - isothermal sphere and an nfw halo .",
    "all mass models suggest the the mass budget of the galaxy to be dominated by dark matter .",
    "models for the receding half of the galaxy are consistent with an extremely dense and compact dark matter core . in these models",
    "it is the dark matter that dominates the gravitational potential at all radii .",
    "the mass models for the approaching half of the galaxy are less well - fitted , yet are still consistent with the observations .",
    "these models show the stellar mass to dominate the gravitational potential at inner radii ( @xmath130  kpc ) , yet still measure the core to be compact ( @xmath131  kpc ) and dense ( @xmath127  ) .",
