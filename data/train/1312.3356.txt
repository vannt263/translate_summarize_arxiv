    "nanoelectronics , nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics have been fields of growing interest in the last several years@xcite .",
    "these areas bring more conventional and explored fields in optics and electronics into the nanoscale regime , where many new phenomena occur and macroscopic descriptions break down or have to be strongly modified .",
    "research into ultrafast nanoscale physics has great potential to both increase the fundamental understanding between light and matter and as lead to groundbreaking new technologies .",
    "as one such example , light - controlled nanoscale circuitry brings together all three of these sub - fields and opens the door to the next generation of optoelectronics - based devices that may operate at frequencies reaching into the petahertz domain @xcite .",
    "ultrafast nanoscale circuitry relies on the ability to utilize the non - linear interaction of light with nanoscale materials to tailor ( collective ) electron motion on a sub - optical - cycle timescale .",
    "these non - linear regimes are reached for strong laser pulses with intensities typically just below the damage threshold of the materials .",
    "such interactions can give rise to ( sub - optical - cycle ) electron emission and acceleration from isolated nanotips @xcite and nanospheres @xcite and from nanostructured surfaces @xcite , the laser - field - driven semi - metallization of dielectrics @xcite and metals @xcite , and can induce currents across nanoscale junctions @xcite . in all these cases ,",
    "the highest laser intensity that can be applied to the material depends on parameters such as material composition and quality and the pulse duration .",
    "the exact reasons for the damage of nanoscale materials are therefore often not well understood . here , we study the melting of conducting , single - crystalline nanowires , which are one of the building blocks of nanoscale circuitry , under the illumination of femtosecond light fields with different intensities and pulse durations",
    ". two types of nanowire arrangements are studied : ( 1 ) free - standing au nanowires that are grown on w needle electrodes and ( 2 ) au nanowires attached to silica slides .",
    "our investigations differ from previous damage threshold studies in a major way .",
    "most studies of optically - induced damage and femtosecond heating in gold nanosystems have been performed for spherical nanoparticles embedded in a matrix or liquid @xcite , whereas we deal with free - standing single - crystalline nanowires .",
    "other recent studies @xcite have analyzed the post damage structure of ag nanowires after their laser - induced melting , but did not report the actual damage threshold . since the composition of the nanosystem may play a major role in limiting the damage threshold , we employ single - crystalline nanowires that were grown with the directed electrochemical nanowire assembly ( dena ) process @xcite .",
    "the low repetition rate of the laser used in our studies , with a spacing of 500 @xmath1s between individual pulses prevents the heating process from accumulating over many laser shots .",
    "model simulations carried out for the interaction of a single laser pulse with a nanowire are in good agreement with the experimental observations .",

    "the pulses were attenuated to 100 @xmath3 10 @xmath4j before entering the experimental set - up shown in figure  [ fig : nano_wire_set_up ] . a half - wave plate and a polarizing beam cube were used to attenuate the peak power of the pulses while keeping the focusing conditions constant .",

    "a manual three - dimensional translation stage was used to position the sample in the focus .",
    "the nanowires were sufficiently long to ensure that the laser focus illuminated only the wire and not the adjacent electrode .",

    "we used lenses l1 and l2 as a condenser for the halogen lamp light as shown in figure  [ fig : nano_wire_set_up ] .",
    "the halogen light was collimated by placing l2 at @xmath5 ( the respective focal lengths ) in front of l3 , allowing for illumination of the entire sample .",
    "both the halogen and the laser radiation were imaged using a 20@xmath6 microscope objective ( o ) attached to a camera . in order to find the optical damage threshold , the samples were initially exposed to laser intensities significantly below the damage regime . to ensure that no optical damage was sustained , the sample was exposed to approximately 20,000 laser pulses ( 10 seconds ) before moving to the next intensity step .",

    "the presence of a transform limited ( tl ) pulse in the interaction region was confirmed by measuring the pulse duration after the sample .",
    "the pulse duration measurements were performed with all the optical elements in place using a frequency resolved optical gating ( frog ) device .",
    "in addition to the tl measurements , we also performed experiments with 108 fs , positively chirped pulses .",

    "[ fig : nano_wire_set_up],width=340 ]      the au nanowires were fabricated by a technique called directed electrochemical nanowire assembly ( dena ) @xcite .",

    "the diameter of these wires is tunable across the 20 nm to @xmath7 1 @xmath1 m range .",

    "the influence of pulse duration becomes evident by comparison of figure  [ fig : damage_data ] ( a ) and ( b ) or figure  [ fig : damage_data ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "the influence of the growth process and heat conduction between the wires and the environment can be extracted from comparison of figure  [ fig : damage_data ] ( a ) and ( c ) for damage at 108 fs and figure  [ fig : damage_data ] ( b ) and ( d ) for damage at 32 fs . while the horizontal axis in figure  [ fig : damage_data ] is the peak intensity of the laser , it is also useful to compare when damage occurs as a function of pulse energy . rearranging the above equation for pulse energy and inserting all constants ( @xmath18",
    "m ) gives @xmath19(m@xmath20s)@xmath21 for 108 fs pules and @xmath22(m@xmath20s)@xmath21 for 32 fs pulses .",
    "this allows for the comparison of damage threshold in the energy picture .",
    "perhaps the most dramatic aspect to this measurement is the very high intensities in which the nanowires are found to survive . with average damage thresholds ranging from a few tw/@xmath17 to above 10 tw/@xmath17 for the respective cases ,",
    "it is clear that au nanowires survive well into the optical strong - field regime .",
    "in addition to this result , a clear distinction in optical damage threshold between the 32 fs and 108 fs cases can be seen for both wires grown on tungsten needles and on gold coated silica slides .",
    "the damage threshold for both cases was higher for 32 fs pulses than for 108 fs pulses .",
    "this corresponds to a factor of @xmath23 for free standing nanowires and a factor of @xmath24 for the wires attached to fused silica substrates , where the uncertainty is due to the spread in the measured damage threshold .",
    "in contrast to this peak intensity picture , analysis of same data using the energy per pulse at which damage occurs we find only a small difference between all four cases . the average pulse energy at which the free nanowires damaged was 80 nj for 32 fs pulses and 112 nj for 108 fs pulses .",
    "the wires attached to fused silica exhibited average damage pulse energies of 132 nj and 169 nj for the 32 fs pulses and 108 fs pulses , respectively .",
    "we will first try to interpret these results from a simple thermodynamics point of view .",
    "the first and simplest approximation is to consider the amount of energy needed to bring the nanowire to the melting temperature from room temperature .",
    "we start with a textbook calculation of @xmath25 , the heat necessary to bring the gold wires to a melting point , @xmath26 , with @xmath27 the mass of the nanowire , @xmath28 the specific heat of au and @xmath29 the change in temperature . to calculate the mass of the nanowire , we take into account the spot size of the laser focus @xmath30 m and @xmath31 nm as the diameter of the nanowire ( approximately the average diameter of our set of nanwires ) . with these assumptions",
    "the amount of energy to heat the part of the nanowire in the laser focus up to it s melting point is @xmath32 nj    to compare this energy with the energy deposited into the wire , we take into account the percentage of each laser pulse that is incident on the wire by integrating over the overlap between the nanowire and the laser focus .",
    "we find that it takes a pulse of 62 nj to bring the nanowire up to melting point ( @xmath33 of the optical energy is incident on the nanowire ) .",
    "experimentally we find that pulses with a total energy of @xmath7 61.5 nj start damaging the wire . of this total energy ,",
    "@xmath7 1.6 nj is deposited on the wire .",
    "thus , this very simplistic calculation agrees quite well with the experimentally observed amount of energy needed to melt the wires .",
    "such agreement indicates that thermal exchange between the wires and the environment can be neglected and also that individual pulses , and not a cumulative heat effect from pulse to pulse , are responsible for the damage .",
    "a more sophisticated description of fs heating in coinage metal nanosystems breaks the absorption of optical energy and subsequent heating of the nanosystem into a 3-step process @xcite .",
    "the first step , ( 1 ) _ electronic absorption _ , occurs when the pulse energy is absorbed by the free electron gas in the nanowire .",
    "this occurs while the envelope of the field is present and results in a state where the electronic temperature has been dramatically increased while the temperature of the lattice has remained unchanged @xcite .",
    "the second step , ( 2 ) _ electron - phonon thermalization _ , is the cooling of this electron gas by interaction with the lattice phonons .",
    "the characteristic time scale for this process ranges from a few picoseconds to a few hundreds of picoseconds depending on the system @xcite .",
    "the third step , ( 3 ) _ external heat diffusion _ , is the non - equilibrium thermal exchange between the nanosystem and the environment in which they are embedded . in general , the third step is dependent on the geometry of the nanostructure and the environment but is often several orders of magnitude or more slower than the electron - phonon thermalization step .",
    "this last step is highly dependent on the type of environment the samples are embedded in .",
    "all three of these steps are modeled by the following set of coupled differential equations @xcite .",
    "@xmath34 where @xmath35 is the lattice temperature profile , @xmath36 is the electron temperature profile , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the respective lattice and electron heat capacities , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the respective thermal diffusivities , @xmath41 is the electron - phonon coupling constant , @xmath42 is the heat loss from the lattice to the surrounding air and @xmath43 is the absorbed power density from the laser pulse .    these equations , in their full form ,",
    "are somewhat challenging to solve exactly . using physical insight to make several approximations",
    ", we can break these equations up into a decoupled set of more manageable equations .",
    "first , our samples are always in air , and because the heat conductivity of gold is much larger than that of air or fused silica , a very small percentage of the heat will dissipate from the gold lattice to the surrounding air .",
    "therefore , we will assume that there are no losses from the wires to the environment or @xmath44 .",
    "the second approximation is that the thermal dissipation of the heated lattice will occur on a timescale that is several orders of magnitude slower than the electron heating or electron - phonon thermalization . in this approximation",
    "all heating of the lattice has already occurred before any significant heat diffusion occurs .",
    "this effectively lets us decouple the spatial term , @xmath45 , in eq .",

[ eq : lattice_only ] . also , because of the very large difference between the length and thickness of the nanowires , we need only solve the spatial equations in one direction . under these assumptions",
    "the heat dissipation of only the lattice in one dimension becomes @xmath48 where @xmath49 is defined to run along the length of the nanowire , the other parameters remain the same as in eq .",
    "[ eq : general_propagation_1 ] and @xmath50 m@xmath20/s @xcite . to find the spatiotemporal temperature evolution of the lattice @xmath51 in our nanowires",
    ", we performed a one - dimensional finite difference numerical simulation of eq .",
    "[ eq : lattice_only ] for the geometry under question .",
    "the initial electronic excitation and subsequent thermal response occurs in a very localized region of the nanowire , defined by the size of the laser focus . to model this we assume an initial spatial gaussian temperature profile ( @xmath52 ) in the nanowire with @xmath53 = 1300 degrees k ( just below the melting temperature of au ) and a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) equal to the laser focus . while this profile may not perfectly reflect the true initial temperature profile in a nanowire after interaction with a fs laser pulse , the important information in this simulation comes from analyzing the ensuing evolution of the temperature profile .",
    "the nanowires used in this experiment had strong thermal coupling to the bulk at the junction of the nanowire and electrode . to take this into account",
    ", we perform this simulation on a numerical grid that is approximately 10 times the size of the nanowire and place the initial temperature peak near the end of this sample grid . figure  [ fig : lattice_cooling ] ( a ) shows a surface plot depicting the transformation in the nanowire after being heated by a laser pulse .",
    "the dashed line indicates where the nanowire would end and the electrode would begin ( nanowire junction )",
    ". figure  [ fig : lattice_cooling ] ( b ) shows line outs from this simulation at several key points of the nanowire ( laser focus , nanowire tip and nanowire junction ) .",
    "analysis of this simulation shows that the temperature in the center of the focal point decays to approximately 20 @xmath54 of the peak temperature within 5 @xmath1s .",
    "50 @xmath1s after the pulse the entire nanowire has cooled to less than 100 degrees above room temperature , and when the next laser pulse comes , 500 @xmath1s later , the wire is only 20 degrees above room temperature ( 2 @xmath54 of the maximum simulated temperature ) .",
    "this result shows just how slow the heat dissipation is and justifies separating this behavior from the general model given in eq .",
    "[ eq : general_propagation_1 ] .",
    "in addition this simulation shows that it is a reasonable assumption that there are negligible residual thermal effects in the nanowire for each subsequent pulse .",

    "[ fig : lattice_cooling],width=283 ]    the heating of the electrons by the laser pulse and electron - phonon thermalization happens much faster than heat diffusion . at these timescales",
    "very little heat diffuses out from the heating area and thus @xmath55 . after removing this spatial contribution to the lattice temperature , @xmath56 eqs .",
    "[ eq : general_propagation_1 ] and [ eq : general_propagation_2 ] can be expressed as @xmath57 where the term @xmath58 is a source term given by @xcite ,    @xmath59    with @xmath60 being the reflectivity of gold ( 0.974 at 800 nm @xcite ) , @xmath61 is the absorption coefficient ( 8.038 @xmath62 at 800 nm @xcite ) and @xmath63 is defined to be in the direction of the laser propagation .    in order to completely decouple the temporal derivatives from the spatial ones , we model the heating of the electron gas to occur in a fixed volume .",
    "this `` effective volume '' is defined by the focal spot size , the nanowire radius , and an effective heating depth @xmath64 which removes the dependence on @xmath63 from the electron heat distribution @xmath65 and the source term @xmath66 .",
    "physically , the adoption of an effective depth implies that we will calculate the electron temperature distribution assuming that the wires heat uniformly up to a thickness @xmath64 . in practice",
    ", @xmath64 is a fitting parameter to our source term and thus to our simulations .",
    "this final approximation leaves us with our final set of equations to model the electron gas heating and electron - phonon thermalization steps , widely used in the literature to explain the heating of nanoparticles @xcite .",
