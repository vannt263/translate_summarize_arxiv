    "in the case of the sis model the expression of the threshold @xmath5 for @xmath24 can be understood by considering the largest hub and its neighbors as a star network of size @xmath25 .",
    "such a system has , in isolation , a threshold @xmath26 and is thus capable , all by itself and independently of the degree of the rest of the vertices , to propagate the infection to a finite fraction of the network , leading to a stable endemic state whenever @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore the most connected vertex which singlehandedly can keep the epidemic activity alive , setting in this way the global threshold for activity in the system .",
    "the change for @xmath28 in equation   is however surprising and hints towards the possibility of different activation mechanisms for different @xmath20 values , thus challenging the belief in the preponderant role of hubs , which has become common wisdom in network science  @xcite .",
    "the results of kitsak _ et al . _ would fit in place , pointing towards a preponderant role for the innermost core of the network .",
    "however , while the picture presented by kitsak et al .",
    "@xcite is compelling for the sir model , the case of the sis deserves a closer look .    in order to shed light on this issue",
    ", we have performed extensive numerical simulations of the sis process on synthetic uncorrelated scale - free networks with degree distribution @xmath29 , generated via the uncorrelated configuration model ( ucm )  @xcite ( see supplementary information online for more details ) .",
    "we have computed the density of infected vertices in the whole network , and the same density when the dynamics takes place ( in isolation ) on the @xmath23-core of highest index ( maximum @xmath23-core ) and on the star - graph centered around the hub of the network , with degree @xmath12 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : ucmdata ] we show the evolution of the recorded densities as a function of time for different values of the spreading rate @xmath6 , in networks with large and small degree exponents , namely @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "our results show a remarkable dependence on the degree exponent : for large @xmath20 , the onset of a global stationary state takes place for the same values of @xmath6 for which the star - graph centered around the hub starts to be active , while the maximum @xmath23-core remains subcritical , with exponentially decaying activity .",
    "this behavior is a proof of the leading role of the hub as the main activation mechanism for large @xmath20 . for small values of @xmath20 , instead",
    ", the picture is opposite : for values of @xmath6 corresponding to a globally active network , the maximum @xmath23-core is in an active state , while the star - graph centered around the hub is inactive , indicating that now the maximum @xmath23-core is the trigger activating the whole system .",
    "two observations are in order : the maximum @xmath23-core is the heart of the nucleus of most densely connected vertices in the network but it does not sharply coincide with it . other nodes , belonging to @xmath23-cores of index slightly smaller , are also densely connected .",
    "the transition in the whole network is influenced also by these other nodes and therefore only approximately coincides with the transition of the maximum @xmath23-core .",
    "this explains why in fig .",
    "[ fig : ucmdata ] the whole network is fully active for @xmath32 , while the maximum @xmath23-core is still around the transition . the second observation is that in uncorrelated networks the hub usually belongs to the maximum @xmath23-core .",
    "yet the two activation mechanisms for epidemics are clearly distinct . in one case ( hub triggered activation )",
    "the hub alone is able to sustain activity in the set of its neighbors and then propagate it to the rest of the system . in the other (",
    "maximum @xmath23-core triggered activation ) the hub alone is not able to sustain activity : only the presence of all densely connected vertices in the @xmath23-core allows them to collectively turn into the active state and propagate to the rest of the system .",
    "this change of behavior with the degree exponent , which we have confirmed for different values of @xmath20 above and below @xmath0 ( see supplementary information figure s1 online ) , can be made more physically transparent by linking it analytically with the different thresholds in equation  .",
    "to do so , we estimate the threshold associated to the active maximum @xmath23-core , whose index is denoted as @xmath33 .",
    "the maximum @xmath23-core has a degree distribution which is bounded and narrow , with minimum ( @xmath33 ) , average , and maximum degree scaling with size in the same way ( see supplementary information figure s2 online ) .",
    "hence its epidemic threshold is well approximated by @xmath34 .",
    "on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite the maximum @xmath23-core index @xmath33 was determined as a function of the network topology , yielding for scale - free networks with @xmath35 @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the minimum degree . introducing this result into the formula for @xmath38 we obtain @xmath39 .",
    "it is most noteworthy that the scaling behavior of the maximum @xmath23-core threshold @xmath40 takes the exact same form as the eigenvalue threshold for @xmath28 in equation  .",
    "this observation provides a physical interpretation of the different activation mechanisms and associated thresholds in uncorrelated scale - free networks : when @xmath41 , the epidemic transition is collectively triggered by the vertices in the innermost core and the threshold is correspondingly given by @xmath42 , as in hmf theory . on the other hand , for @xmath43 ,",
    "the hub triggers the global activity , and the threshold is given by @xmath44 .",
    "an additional inspection of the numerical values of the different thresholds ( see supplementary information table s1 online ) shows that the thresholds computed from the numerical estimation of the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix are in very good agreement with the predictions of eq .  , perfectly accounting for the results observed in figure  [ fig : ucmdata ] .",
    "we turn now our attention to the sir model , which , contrarily to the steady - state dynamics of the sis model , exhibits transient outbreaks characterized by the number of infected individuals , totaling a finite fraction of the system only above the epidemic threshold .",
    "evidence that the hub plays no special role in sir dynamics comes from considering this process on a star network of size @xmath25 .",
    "for an epidemics starting from a randomly chosen vertex , the average final density of infected nodes takes the form ( see methods ) @xmath45 hence the threshold in a star network , defined by the value of @xmath6 above which @xmath46 takes a given fixed finite value , is a constant independent of @xmath12 , in the limit of large @xmath12",
    ". the hub can not therefore be the ultimate trigger of global outbreaks in the sir model , and this role must instead be played by the maximum @xmath23-core for any value of @xmath20 , in accordance with ref .",
    "additional support for this view comes from extending to the sir case the maximum @xmath23-core threshold argument presented for the sis model .",
    "approximating again the maximum @xmath23-core as a narrowly distributed graph of average degree @xmath47 , a threshold is obtained from mf theory of the form @xmath48 .",
    "given the form of @xmath33 in equation  , this threshold scales in the large network limit in exactly the same form as the hmf prediction , namely @xmath49 $ ] @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that in the sir model it is always the maximum @xmath23-core which controls epidemic spreading and sets the threshold to the hmf value .",
    "this picture is substantiated in figure  [ fig : ucmsir ] , where we consider the sir model on ucm networks with different values of @xmath20 , keeping track , as a function of @xmath6 , of the density of infected individuals in the global network , in the maximum @xmath23-core and in the star - graph centered around the hub .",
    "as we can see , the position of the transition to a finite fraction of infected vertices is closely correlated in the whole network and the maximum @xmath23-core , while the behavior of the hub conforms to the prediction of equation  .",
    "the scenario discussed so far applies to the case of uncorrelated networks , where the probability that a random edge is connected to a vertex of degree @xmath8 is proportional to @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "real networks , however , present in most cases some level of degree correlations @xcite , as measured by the pearson coefficient @xcite or by the average degree of the nearest neighbors ( ann ) of the vertices of given degree , @xmath51 @xcite . in order to ascertain their effect on the relevant epidemic mechanisms , we have considered the sis process on several instances of correlated real networks ( see methods ) : an internet map at the autonomous system ( as ) level , the social network of pretty - good - privacy ( pgp ) , and the network of actors co - starring in hollywood movies ( movies ) .",
    "all these networks have a degree distribution compatible with a power law , with an exponent close to @xmath52 ( see supplementary information figure s3 online ) and a range of degree correlations ( see supplementary information figure s4 online ) . in this case , according to our arguments above and neglecting correlations , one would expect the transitions to be ruled by the corresponding maximum @xmath23-cores .",
    "this fact is confirmed for the movies and pgp networks , by the sis simulations presented in figure  [ fig : realdata ] , showing that the transition occurs simultaneously for the maximum @xmath23-core and the whole system , while the star - graph centered around the hub remains inactive . in the case of the as network , instead , the picture is surprisingly the opposite , and it is apparently the hub the responsible of the epidemic transition , see figure  [ fig : realdata ] .",
    "the situation is still more complex when one considers other , larger as maps ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "in fact , as it turns out from the analysis of numerical simulations ( see supplementary information figure s5 online ) , the general situation in as maps is that we can reach in the network an active , infected state for values of @xmath6 for which both the hub and the maximum @xmath23-core are apparently subcritical .",
    "this observation hints towards a mixing of activation mechanisms for the particular case of as networks .",
    "this discrepancy between the as and the other networks , confirmed by the inspection of the values of the different thresholds ( see supplementary information table s2 online ) can be attributed to the presence of strong degree correlations . measuring them by means of the auxiliary ann function @xmath53 , we can observe that the as network is strongly correlated , with @xmath53 decaying as @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , these correlations are so strong that they do not wash away even after randomizing the network , as they do in the pgp and movies networks ( see supplementary information figure s4 online ) .",
    "strong disassortative correlations reduce the interconnections of vertices of high - degree , suppressing in this way the index @xmath33 of the maximum @xmath23-core and reducing the number of vertices that compose it .",
    "this situation , i.e. a very large hub coupled with a relatively small maximum @xmath23-core , leads to a mixing of both mechanisms that does not allow to make explicit prediction about the most relevant one .",
    "similar or opposite effects ( i.e. strong assortativity enhancing the role of the maximum @xmath23-core ) can be found in networks generated by means of the weber - porto algorithm  @xcite , a modification of the configuration model that generates graphs with prescribed degree distribution and correlations of tunable strength ( see supplementary information figure s6 and table s2 online ) .",
    "the rationalization of the different mechanisms that keep an epidemic process alive in a heterogeneous substrate turns out to be a more complex issue than previously believed .",
    "in fact , two different subsets of vertices ( either the hub or the innermost core of the network ) can take the role of `` super - spreaders '' of the infection , depending on the nature of the epidemic process and on the topological features of the underlying network . in processes with no steady state , such as the sir model , the innermost core is the main trigger activating infection and setting the value of the epidemic threshold . on the contrary , in processes allowing an endemic steady - state",
    ", the actual activation mechanism depends essentially on the degree of heterogeneity of the network .",
    "this simple picture , valid for uncorrelated networks , can be however modified by the presence of strong degree correlations , which can shift the weight towards one or the other mechanism .",
    "these observations call for further theoretical research on epidemic processes on strongly correlated networks . on the other hand",
    ", our results might find practical applications in the implementation of optimized immunization strategies , which can be designed to target the actual `` super - spreaders '' of a given contact network .",
    "moreover , our work could turn out to be relevant to other types of spreading processes , such as information , behavior or rumor spreading , and more in general , to dynamical processes whose behavior and possible transitions are ruled by the value of the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix , such as , for example , synchronization phenomena . also , for these latter dynamics , our results call for additional investigations on the existence and interplay of the relevant activation mechanisms .",
    "in the sis model , individuals can be in one of two states , either susceptible or infected .",
    "susceptibles become infected by contact with infected individuals , with a rate equal to the number of infected contacts times a given spreading rate @xmath6 .",
    "infected individuals on the other hand become healthy again with a rate @xmath55 that can be taken arbitrarily equal to unity , thus setting the characteristic time scale .",
    "this model allows thus individuals to contract the infection time and again , making possible , in the infinite population limit , a sustained infected steady state ( endemic state ) .",
    "this occurs for values of @xmath6 larger than the epidemic threshold @xmath5 , while for @xmath56 the epidemics lasts only for a finite time and asymptotically all individuals are healthy .    in the sir model , on the other hand , individuals can be in one of three different states : susceptible , infected and recovered ( or removed ) .",
    "the dynamical rule for susceptible individuals is the same as for sis . with a rate @xmath55 ( again set to unity )",
    "infected individuals change their state and recover .",
    "recovered individuals are completely inert and can not become infected again . with this dynamics the system always reaches asymptotically an absorbing state with only susceptible or removed individuals and no infected ones .",
    "a threshold @xmath5 separates a regime where outbreaks reach a finite fraction of the individuals ( i.e. the final density of removed individuals is finite ) from a regime @xmath57 where only an infinitesimal fraction of individuals is hit .",
    "the @xmath23-core decomposition is an iterative procedure to classify vertices of a network in layers of increasing density of connections . starting with the full graph one removes the vertices with only one connection ( degree @xmath58 ) .",
    "this procedure is then repeated until only nodes with degree @xmath59 are left .",
    "the removed nodes constitute the @xmath60-shell and those remaining are the @xmath61-core . at the next step all vertices with degree @xmath62 removed , thus leaving the @xmath63-core .",
    "the procedure is repeated iteratively .",
    "the maximum @xmath23-core ( of index @xmath33 ) is the set of vertices such that one more iteration of the procedure removes all of them .",
    "notice that all vertices of the @xmath23-core of index @xmath23 have degree larger than or equal to @xmath23 .",
    "figure  [ fig : examplenet ] shows an example of the @xmath23-core decomposition performed on a small network of size @xmath64 and largest degree @xmath65 .",
    "let us consider the sir process on a star network of size @xmath66 .",
    "the process starts from a randomly infected vertex , and proceeds till all infected vertices become eventually removed .",
    "we want to compute the average final density of removed vertices at the end of an outbreak , which is given by @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the total number of removed vertices .",
    "let us define @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the number of removed vertices from secondary infections .",
    "the outcome of the process will depend on whether the initial infected site is the hub or a leaf ( a vertex of degree @xmath71 ) .",
    "if the infection starts in the hub , which will happen with probability @xmath72 , the average number of secondary infected vertices will be @xmath73 .",
    "on the contrary , the infection can start in a leaf with probability @xmath74 . in this case",
    ", the hub can become infected with probability @xmath6 , and from there , spread the infection to the remaining @xmath75 susceptible leaves .",
    "therefore , in this case the average number of secondary infections is @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "the average total number of removed sites at the end of the spreading process will therefore be @xmath77\\\\      & = & 1 + \\frac{\\lambda q_{max}}{q_{max}+1 } [ 2+\\lambda ( q_{max}-1 ) ]      \\simeq 1 + 2 \\lambda + \\lambda^2 q_{max},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the last expression is valid in the limit of large @xmath12 .",
    "from here it follows the expression for the average final density of infected vertices , equation  , valid also in the limit of large @xmath12 .",
