    "a particularly deceptive situation concerns the interpretation of the low magnetic ordering temperature @xmath8 , as compared to the effective energy scale of exchange couplings , which is typically measured by the curie - weiss temperature @xmath9 . if @xmath10 , long - range magnetic order is impeded by quantum fluctuations , but it is impossible to decide _ a priori _ whether this effect originates from the low dimensionality , from the frustration , or from a combination of both .",
