    "an ultracompact hii ( uchii ) region is one of the earliest signposts for the presence of a young , massive star ( for reviews , see @xcite 2002 and @xcite 2007 ) .",
    "while the star itself is still too embedded in its parent molecular cloud to be detected optically , it heats up surrounding dust .",
    "a small region , some @xmath3  cm in extent , glows brightly in the far infrared .",
    "ionization of ambient gas also creates free - free emission in the radio continuum , with electron densities in excess of @xmath4 @xmath5 and thus emission measures of @xmath6 pc @xmath7 or more .",
    "it is through this radio emission , relatively minor in the overall energy budget , that uchii regions have been classified morphologically .    in their pioneering radio",
    "interferometric survey , @xcite found that 30  percent of the spatially resolved regions have a cometary shape ( see also @xcite 1994 , @xcite 1998 ) .",
    "one sees a bright arc of emission filled in by an extended , lower - intensity lobe that fades away from the arc .",
    "oh masers may be found along the bright rim .",
    "other uchii regions exhibit only the emission arc ; presumably the interior lobe in these cases is undetectably faint .",
    "still other classes identified by @xcite include : spherical , core - halo ( a bright peak surrounded by a fainter envelope ) , shell ( a ring of emission ) , and irregular ( multiple emission peaks ) .",
    "all told , the cometary morphology is the most common one found , and needs to be explained by any viable theoretical model .",
    "spectral line studies have been used to probe the kinematics of these regions .",
    "observations of radio recombination lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and infrared fine - structure lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reveal large line - widths , indicative of supersonic flow . in cases where the flow can be spatially resolved",
    ", one also sees a velocity gradient .",
    "this gradient is steepest in the  head - to - tail \" direction @xcite .    very often ,",
    "the observed peak in radio continuum or oh maser emission , either of which effectively locates the star , does _ not _ coincide with the peak in molecular lines or submillimeter continuum emission , which trace the densest molecular gas and dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this gas is located within infrared dark clouds , currently believed to be the birth sites of all massive stars @xcite .",
    "the clumps within these clouds have typical sizes of 1 pc , number densities of @xmath8 @xmath5 and masses of about @xmath4 @xmath2 ; some qualify as hot cores @xcite .",
    "the offset of the peak radio emission of the uhcii region from the center of this clump is typically a few arcseconds , corresponding to approximately 0.1 pc for a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "both the cometary morphology and the acceleration of ionized gas are likely related to this physical displacement , as was first emphasised by @xcite .",
    "the foregoing observations , taken together , show convincingly that the cometary structures represent ionized gas accelerating away from the densest portion of the nearby cloud material .",
    "theorists have long considered photoevaporating flows created by a massive star illuminating one face of a cloud @xcite .",
    "the most well - studied classical hii region of all , the orion nebula , is a prime example of the resulting  blister , \" here formed by the massive star @xmath9  c on the surface of the orion  a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "a tenuous , hemispherical body of ionized gas surrounds @xmath9  c and the other trapezium stars , and is flowing away from the background cloud .",
    "when massive stars are still deeply embedded in the densest portion of their parent cloud , it is not obvious how such photoevaporating flows can be maintained .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the small size of uchii regions suggests a brief dynamical lifetime .",
    "if they undergo pressure - driven expansion at @xmath10 km s@xmath0 , they will expand to a size greater than 0.1  pc in roughly @xmath4  yr , or one percent of the lifetime of the host star .",
    "in reality , some 10 percent of o stars are associated with uchii regions , suggesting that the lifetime of these regions is larger by an order of magnitude .",
    "confinement by thermal pressure alone would result in an emission measure even higher than is observed @xcite . in the context of cometary structures , this venerable  lifetime problem \" raises a fundamental question .",
    "what reservoir of matter can feed the ionized flows over a period of @xmath8  yr ?",
    "@xcite suggested that the star may be photoevaporating its own accretion disk .",
    "when ultraviolet radiation from a massive star impinges on the disk , gas streams off at the sound speed , at least in that outer region where this speed exceeds the local escape velocity .",
    "@xcite have analyzed this launching process in more detail .",
    "the outer accretion disk radius of approximately @xmath11 cm is much smaller than the @xmath3  cm size of uchii regions .",
    "thus , while the model views a disk as the ultimate source of matter for the ionized flow , it does not address the flow s cometary morphology .",
    "one possibility is that the prominent arc represents the shock interface between a high - velocity stellar wind and the parent cloud .",
    "massive stars indeed generate , through radiative acceleration , winds with terminal velocities of about 1000  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "if the star itself moves through the cloud at supersonic speed , e.g. 20  km  s@xmath0 , then the curved bowshock has the right form @xcite",
    ". moreover , a star that is moving toward the observer creates a  core - halo \" structure , also commonly seen . the relatively fast stellar velocity ,",
    "however , implies that the whole interaction would last for a few times @xmath4 years if the star indeed travels through a molecular clump 1 pc in size .",
    "consequently , this bowshock model may fall prey to the lifetime problem .",
    "another concern is that massive stars , with the exception of runaway objects , do not move at such high speeds relative to parent molecular gas .",
    "for instance , the trapezium stars in the orion nebula cluster have a velocity dispersion of a few km s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "suppose instead that the embedded star is not moving with respect to the densest gas , but is displaced from it , as is suggested by the observations .",
    "then one side of its expanding hii region eventually erupts into the surrounding low - density medium .",
    "such a `` champagne flow '' model was first explored by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite to explain asymmetric , classical hii regions .",
    "the high internal pressure of the hii region accelerates the ionized gas to supersonic speed away from the ambient cloud , whose density was taken to be @xmath12 @xmath5 .",
    "meanwhile , the ionization front steadily advances at several km  s@xmath0 into this cloud , generating volumes of ionized gas several parsecs in diameter .    another model , that of the mass - loaded wind @xcite , invokes champagne - type dynamics in combination with a stellar wind .",
    "the idea is that the wind , perhaps in combination with the stellar radiation field , ablates the cloud , entraining the gas within it .",
    "pressure gradients may then accelerate the gas in a champagne flow . in some versions of the model ,",
    "the new mass originates in dense globules that are continually being ionized @xcite .",
    "while successful in explaining the morphologies and lifetimes of uchii regions , the model does not address in detail how the dense globules enter the ionized flow .",
    "thus , the mass - loading prescription adopted was somewhat ad hoc .",
    "@xcite modeled the growth of an hii region inside a bondi accretion flow .",
    "if the ionization front is located inside the bondi radius @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the stellar mass and @xmath15 the ionized sound speed , then gas simply crosses the ionization front and continues toward the star as an ionized accretion flow . until its size reaches @xmath16 ,",
    "the hii region can expand only as the ionizing flux from the star increases along with the stellar mass .",
    "the hii region then exists in steady state , continuously fed by the molecular accretion .",
    "thus , the lifetime of the hii region is tied to the accretion time scale of the star .",
    "observations of the uchii region around the cluster of massive stars g10.6 - 0.4 indicate that this kind of molecular and ionized accretion could be occurring @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations of the same cluster @xcite also show an asymmetric bipolar outflow of ionized gas .",
    "these observations motivated @xcite to develop a model in which inflow and outflow occur simultaneously in a rotationally flattened geometry .",
    "the ionization creates an hii region elongated perpendicular to the accretion flow .",
    "where the ionization extends beyond @xmath16 , the hii region can expand hydrodynamically as a pressure - driven parker wind ( see also @xcite ) . along the equatorial plane , dense molecular gas continues to flow into the hii region .",
    "one of the motivations of the present paper is to detail exactly how an ionized outflow may be supplied by inflow of molecular gas , although here we consider a mechanism to draw in this gas that is separate from the gravitational attraction of the star .",
    "another model combining ionization and gravitational accretion was that of @xcite , who suggested that an uchii region may form as a gravitationally collapsing substructure within a larger , expanding hii region .",
    "more detailed simulations by @xcite found that an uchii region embedded in an accretion flow rapidly changes morphologies through all the observed types , and could be sustained by the addition of infalling gas from the parent cloud .",
    "the collapsing ionized gas in their simulations creates bipolar molecular outflows , as are observed to accompany some uchii regions @xcite .",
    "@xcite also claimed that magnetic pressure might play a significant role in confining uchii regions . on the other hand , @xcite performed their own radiation - mhd simulation of an hii region expanding into a turbulent cloud .",
    "they found that magnetic pressure plays only a minor role in confinement .",
    "other recent simulations have combined various elements in the original models to account for the proliferating observational results now becoming available . @xcite simulated a champagne flow in which the ionization front is stalled as it climbs a density gradient into a neutral cloud supported by turbulent pressure .",
    "@xcite explored the coupled roles of champagne flows and stellar winds .",
    "finally , @xcite revised the bowshock idea by introducing a finite but modest stellar velocity with respect to the cloud .    in the present paper",
    "we pursue a different goal . accepting that every cometary uchii region is an ionized flow , we elucidate the basic issue of how such a flow may continue to draw in gas from the neutral cloud .",
    "we agree with previous researchers that the momentum of the ionized flow is not supplied by the star , but by the thermal pressure gradient of the gas itself . a key result of our own study will be to demonstrate that the expansion of this flow causes the ionized gas to become _ underpressured _ with respect to the neutral cloud .",
    "this pressure differential draws neutral material from the cloud into the champagne flow in a self - sustaining manner .",
    "we assume at the outset that the flow is quasi - steady , as was found in the late stages of the simulations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this basic simplification allows us to rapidly explore parameter space , as we detail below .",
    "thus , we can assess how well our rather minimal set of physical assumptions explains the basic characteristics of cometary uchii regions .",
    "our quasi - one dimensional model does not allow us to include evacuation by a stellar wind , but we do account for the effect of radiation pressure and show that it is appreciable .    in section  [ modeldescription ]",
    "below , we introduce our steady - state model for cometary uchii regions .",
    "section  [ flowequations ] develops the equations governing the density and velocity of the ionized flow . in section  [ nondimensionalization ]",
    ", we recast these equations in nondimensional form and then outline our solution strategy .",
    "section  [ results ] presents our numerical results , and section  [ comparisontoobservations ] compares them to observations .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusion ] indicates fruitful directions for future investigations .",
    "we idealize the molecular cloud as a planar slab , in which the cloud density peaks at the midplane ( see figure [ schematic ] ) .",
    "the choice of planar geometry is made for computational convenience and is probably not a realistic representation of the clouds of interest .",
    "however , our qualitative results are not sensitive to the adopted cloud density profile , as we verify explicitly in section [ results ] below .",
    "we envision a massive star embedded within this cloud , but offset from the midplane , in accordance with the observations mentioned previously .",
    "this offset creates an asymmetric , ionized region of relatively low density . toward the cloud midplane",
    ", this ionized gas resembles a classical hii region .",
    "its boundary , a d - type ionization front , advances up the density gradient . in the opposite direction ,",
    "the front breaks free and gas streams away supersonically .",
    "the pressure gradient within the ionized gas creates an accelerating flow away from the cloud .",
    "apart from the higher - density cloud environment , our model is identical in spirit to the champagne flows proposed in the past .",
    "once the velocity of the advancing ionization front falls significantly below the ionized sound speed , the flow becomes steady - state .",
    "we adopt this steady - state assumption in our model , and assume that the structure of the background cloud is evolving over a long timescale compared to the ionized sound crossing time . in the simulations of @xcite , a steady flow is approached some @xmath8 years after the massive star turns on . by this point , the ionization front has virtually come to rest in the frame of the star .",
    "we will later determine more precisely the speed of the ionization front in our model and show that it is consistent with the steady - state assumption .",
    "the shock that originally formed ahead of the ionization front , as it transitioned from r - type to d - type , has by now advanced deep into the cloud and died away .",
    "the hii region facing the cloud midplane expands , albeit slowly . while the ionized gas is optically thick to ultraviolet radiation from the star , some does leak through and strikes the cavity wall within the neutral cloud .",
    "additional gas is thus dissociated and ionized , and streams off the wall to join the outward flow .",
    "while the injection speed at the wall is subsonic , the thermal pressure gradient within the ionized gas accelerates it to supersonic velocity .",
    "both this flow and the advancing front erode the cloud , whose structure gradually evolves in response",
    ".      we will always consider systems that possess azimuthal symmetry .",
    "we establish a spherical coordinate system whose origin is at the star .",
    "the polar direction , @xmath17 , coincides with the central axis of the flow depicted in figure [ schematic ] .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the total number of ionizing photons per time generated by the star .",
    "if we further assume ionization balance within the volume of the ionized cavity , and make use of the on - the - spot approximation , then the ionizing radiation extends out to the cavity wall @xmath19 , given implicitly by @xmath20 ^ 2 \\,+\\ , r_f^2\\,f_{\\ast \\ , , \\ , { \\rm wall } } ( \\theta ) \\,\\ , .",

    "we have pulled this factor out of the integral since it depends only on the ionized gas temperature , which we assume to be spatially uniform .",
    "the term @xmath22 is the number density of ionized gas , including both protons and electrons . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that the composition of the gas is pure hydrogen , so the number of free protons is equal to the number of free electrons and both of these number densities are equal to @xmath23 .",
    "finally , @xmath24 is that portion of the star s ionizing photon flux which escapes the hii region and strikes the wall of the cavity .",
    "this remnant flux is critical for maintaining the flow .    but how important is the second term of equation ( [ exactraytracing ] ) in a quantitative sense ?",
    "each photon striking the front ionizes a hydrogen atom , itself already dissociated from a hydrogen molecule , thereby creating a proton and an electron .",
    "let @xmath25 be the number flux of protons and electrons injected into the flow at each position along the front .",
    "thus , @xmath26 at each angle @xmath27 , and we may write the foregoing equation as @xmath28    the flux @xmath25 is of order @xmath29 , where @xmath22 is now a typical value of the ionized gas number density .",
    "if @xmath30 in equation ( [ raytracingrewritten ] ) now represents the size scale of the flow , then the ratio of the second to the first righthand term in this equation is of order @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the effective sound speed and number density within the cloud ( see below ) .",
    "here we have assumed that the ionized material is at least in rough pressure balance with the cloud , so that .",

    "] we trace the ionization front by finding that function @xmath19 which obeys the approximate , but quantitatively accurate relation , @xmath35      even within our simplifying assumption of axisymmetry , it would be a daunting task to trace a fully two - dimensional flow . while we accurately follow the ionization front bounding the flow in two dimensions",
    ", we further assume that the density and velocity are only functions of @xmath36 . in this quasi one - dimensional model",
    ", we are effectively averaging the ionized density @xmath22 and velocity @xmath37 laterally at each @xmath36-value .",
    "this simplification is innocuous in regions where the lateral change in these quantities is relatively small .",
    "it is more problematic when the ionized gas becomes overpressured with respect to the ambient cloud .",
    "luckily , most of the radio emission comes from the densest portion of the flow , well before this point is reached .",
    "hence , our model produces reasonably accurate results when predicting observed emission measures .    turning to the cloud itself , we assume it to be self - gravitating , with an internal supporting pressure arising from turbulence .",
    "hence , we do not consider the possibility that the object is in a state of collapse .",
    "we crudely model the turbulence by adopting an isothermal equation of state , characterized by an effective sound speed @xmath38 . in our model , it is only the mass of the cloud that affects the flow gravitationally .",
    "that is , we neglect both the self - gravity of the ionized gas , and the pull of the massive star .",

    "combining this with a turbulent velocity dispersion of @xmath48 km s@xmath0 yields a jeans mass on the order of @xmath49 , far less than the @xmath50 clumps in giant molecular clouds spawning massive stars and their surrounding clusters .",
    "we stress again that our cloud is a relatively small fragment containing the newborn star . in our view , it is the high density of this gas that determines the morphology of the uchii region , and the dispersal of the clump that sets the characteristic lifetime .",
    "quantitative modeling of hii regions , and uchii regions in particular , has generally neglected the dynamical effect of radiation pressure from the massive star ( see , however , @xcite @xcite ) . for the very dense environments we are now considering , the radiative force has substantial influence on the ionized flow , as we shall demonstrate through explicit calculation .",

    "if we assume that the gas is in ionization equilibrium , then the number of photons absorbed per unit volume of gas equals the corresponding volumetric rate of recombination , @xmath53 .",
    "the assumption of ionization equilibrium is justified because the typical recombination time , @xmath54 10@xmath55 s , is much less than the flow time @xmath56",

    "we thus find    @xmath61    this expression is consistent with that given in ( * ? ? ?",

    "let @xmath73 be the average flow speed in the @xmath36-direction .",
    "similarly , let @xmath74 and @xmath75 represent the number density and speed , respectively , of ionized gas being injected into the flow just inside the ionization front .",
    "then the requirement of mass conservation is @xmath76 here , the first two terms of the righthand side are the rate of mass advection through the bottom and top layers of the control volume , respectively .",
    "the final righthand term is the rate of mass injection .",
    "we assume that the injected flow direction is normal to the ionization front .",
    "henceforth , we will drop the subscript @xmath77 when referring to the density and velocity of the ionized flow .    under our steady - state assumption , the lefthand side of equation ( [ firstmassconservation ] ) vanishes .",
    "dividing through by @xmath70 , and taking the limit @xmath78 , leads to @xmath79 we will later derive an expression for @xmath80 from the jump conditions across the ionization front and show that this velocity is subsonic , i.e. , @xmath81 at any @xmath36 . although our derived @xmath80 is properly measured in the rest frame of the ionization front , we will show in section [ jumpconditions ] that the front is moving very slowly compared to @xmath15 .",

    "as explained previously , we end our calculation at the crossover point , and do not attempt to track the complex dynamics of the flow as it continues to spread laterally and deposit its momentum into the lower - density surrounding gas . in any event , there are fewer observational constraints on this more diffuse flow .",
    "figure [ fiducialdensityandvelocity ] shows the run of the density and velocity of the ionized gas with @xmath36-position .",
    "the velocity displays a smooth sonic transition , and a nearly constant acceleration throughout .",
    "the velocity at the base is very close to zero , but this is not the case for other parameter choices , as we will describe in the following section",

    "the radiation force at first retards the flow , and is a minor contributor to its acceleration above the star s position . finally , it is noteworthy that the gravitational force is negligible for most of the flow .",
    "the top panel of figure [ ifrontvaryeverything ] shows how the shape of the converged ionization front changes with the stellar photon emission rate @xmath18 , while the cloud midplane density @xmath44 and stellar displacement from the midplane @xmath169 are held fixed at their fiducial values . in this case",
    "the variation is predictable .",
    "a higher photon emission rate allows the ionizing photons to penetrate farther into the neutral cloud , in a manner similar to how the strmgren radius of a spherical hii region increases with emission rate .",
    "a larger luminosity also leads to more flaring of the ionization front at large values of @xmath36 .",
    "we did not consider systems with photon emission rate @xmath170 because , at those low luminosities , the fraction of the star s luminosity that is composed of ionizing photons drops rapidly .",

    "the flow structure remains strikingly similar as the luminosity is varied , changing primarily in spatial extent , because a higher luminosity allows ionizing radiation to penetrate farther into the cloud .",
    "the fact that the density and velocity profiles do not show other significant variations with luminosity reinforces the conclusion that it is the density structure of the neutral cloud that sets the spatial variation in the ionized flow .",
    "the second panel of figure [ ifrontvaryeverything ] shows how the shape of the converged ionization front changes with the stellar displacement @xmath169 . here",
    ", the effect is similar to that of increasing @xmath18 . with higher @xmath169 ,",

    "again , the ionized gas density tracks that of the neutral cloud . for larger offsets ,",
    "the flow begins in a less dense portion of the cloud , and the density of the ionized flow is smaller .",
    "since the ionizing stellar photons penetrate farther into the cloud when @xmath169 is larger , the flow begins at more negative values of @xmath36 .",
    "the velocity profiles shift along the @xmath36-axis as @xmath169 is varied , but the acceleration remains roughly the same .    attempting to lower @xmath169 below a value of unity , while keeping @xmath44 and @xmath18 fixed at their fiducial values , results in the same problem as attempting to increase @xmath18 on its own .",
    "solutions with lower values of @xmath169 can be achieved only if @xmath44 is simultaneously increased or @xmath18 is decreased .",
    "increasing @xmath169 alone also leads to a large amount of flaring of the ionization front . for @xmath174 ,",
    "the flaring at the location of pressure crossover is such that @xmath175 . as we shall see in section [ emissionmeasuremaps ] , this aspect ratio is large compared to observations .",
    "the third panel of figure [ ifrontvaryeverything ] shows how the shape of the ionization front changes when @xmath44 is varied on its own . in this case , the variation is more complex . as can be seen from equations ( [ slabdensity ] ) and ( [ scaleheight ] ) , changing @xmath44 changes not only the overall magnitude of the density profile , but also the steepness of its falloff .",
    "when @xmath44 is increased from @xmath176 to @xmath177 , the rise in the midplane density means that radiation can not penetrate as far , and the base of the ionized flow moves closer to the star .",
    "however , as @xmath44 is increased further to @xmath178 , the steeper falloff of the density comes into play , and the distance between the star and the base of the flow remains nearly constant .",
    "we may effectively factor out the increasing cloud scale height if , instead of increasing @xmath44 on its own , we simultaneously _ decrease _ @xmath169 so that @xmath179 remains equal to unity",
    ". this result of this exercise is shown in the bottom panel of figure [ ifrontvaryeverything ] .",

    "figure [ velocityvaryn0 ] shows how the density and velocity profiles respond to changes in @xmath44 . for a denser neutral cloud",
    ", the ionized flow also begins at a larger density .",
    "at the same time , the density of both the neutral and ionized gas drop more rapidly for a larger @xmath44 , and the @xmath36-extent of the flow diminishes . finally ,",
    "since the ionized gas is primarily accelerated via pressure gradients , a steeper decline in density also corresponds to a more rapid acceleration .",
    "we may again factor out the effect of scale height by varying @xmath44 and @xmath169 simultaneously in the manner described previously .",
    "the resulting density and velocity profiles are shown in figure [ velocityvaryn0andzeta ] . in this case the density at the base of the ionized flow again increases with rising @xmath44 , but now in a more systematic manner .",
    "in fact , this base density remains almost exactly equal to @xmath185 , reflecting the fact that the flows are beginning at pressures very close to the neutral cloud pressure .",
    "this near - pressure equality also accounts for the fact that the velocities begin near zero in all of these flows .",
    "the velocity profiles are remarkable for the fact that they share an anchor point near the stellar position at @xmath186 .",
    "their @xmath36-length scales correlate tightly with the changing cloud scale height .",

    "dimensionally , this rate , from the base to any height @xmath36 , is @xmath187    figure [ massinjectionterms ] displays @xmath188 in our fiducial model .",
    "the cross - sectional area of the flow starts at zero and monotonically increases with @xmath36 .",
    "the mass injection rate also climbs from zero , but levels off at the pressure crossover point , where no new mass is being added .",
    "we have also plotted the injection speed , @xmath189 .",
    "this starts out relatively small , peaks at about half the ionized sound speed at @xmath190 , and then eventually falls to zero . as the figure also shows , @xmath191 attains its maximum close to where @xmath75 peaks .",
    "we stop our calculation at the pressure crossover location @xmath192 , where neutral material ceases to be drawn into the ionized flow . in steady state , the rate at which ionized mass crosses @xmath192 should equal the total rate of mass injection up to this point .",
    "that is , the mass _ outflow _ rate in ionized gas should be @xmath193 we may also calculate @xmath194 using the local dimensional relation @xmath195 we find that we obtain the same mass outflow rate using these two methods to within a precision of 0.1 percent , providing a useful check on mass conservation .",
    "dimensionally , the mass outflow rate is @xmath196 where the nondimensional quantity @xmath197 is @xmath198 the dependence of @xmath199 on our three parameters @xmath18 , @xmath44 , and @xmath169 is entirely contained within @xmath197 .",

    "the mass loss rate is far more sensitive to changing parameters than is @xmath206 , so the trends in momentum and energy transport can be explained almost entirely by the trends in @xmath194 . moreover , as equation ( [ mdotdefinition2 ] ) demonstrates , @xmath194 is principally affected by changes in the cross - sectional area and density at @xmath192 .",
    "as before , we first examine the effect of varying the photon emission rate . with increasing @xmath18",
    ", @xmath207 increases as well , driving up @xmath194 . on the other hand ,",
    "spreading of the flow results in a slight decline of the density @xmath208 .",
    "this latter effect weakens the sensitivity of @xmath194 to @xmath18 .",

    "similar trends appear when we increase the stellar offset @xmath169 , leaving other parameters fixed ( see second level of table 1 ) . with larger @xmath169 ,",
    "the ionization flow flares out . at the same time",

    "nevertheless , the net effect is for @xmath194 to increase . in the range @xmath211 , we find that @xmath194 scales as @xmath212 .    increasing @xmath44 on its own leads to complicated behavior similar to that we encountered previously .",
    "as @xmath44 rises from @xmath176 to @xmath177 , @xmath194 first falls because the ionization front shrinks in size ( see third panel of figure [ ifrontvaryeverything ] ) . however , as @xmath44 further increases from @xmath177 to @xmath141 , the cloud scale height continues to shrink .",
    "the rapidly declining cloud density at any fixed @xmath36 causes the ionized outflow to broaden , and @xmath194 rises .    finally , we may vary @xmath44 and @xmath169 simultaneously ,",
    "so as to keep @xmath213 .",
    "the fourth panel of figure [ ifrontvaryeverything ] shows that the ionization front retains its shape but shrinks in scale .",
    "as figure [ velocityvaryn0andzeta ] shows , increasing @xmath44 under these circumstances raises the ionized density at any @xmath36 .",
    "consequently , the stellar radiation can not penetrate as far .",
    "in particular , @xmath207 becomes smaller at the pressure crossover point .",
    "table 1 verifies that this shrinking of the cross - sectional area causes @xmath194 to decline .",
    "quantitatively , we find @xmath214 .",
    "the fact that the mass outflow rate generally decreases with increasing cloud density is significant , and calls for a more basic physical explanation .",
    "the lateral size @xmath71 of the outflow is about that of a pressure - bounded hii region . from equation ( [ stromgrenradius ] )",

    "finally , if @xmath22 is proportional to the peak neutral density @xmath44 , as follows from the condition of pressure equilibrium , then we have @xmath218 , which is close to our numerical result .",
    "this argument also helps to explain why the mass loss rates that we obtain are smaller than those of past champagne flow calculations . for example , @xcite found that , for a star with @xmath219 s@xmath0 embedded in a slablike molecular cloud of uniform number density @xmath12 @xmath5 , the mass loss rate is @xmath220 @xmath2 yr@xmath0 . for the much denser molecular cloud in our fiducial model , extrapolation of the @xcite rate using @xmath218 yields",

    "the effect of radiation pressure diminishes at higher values of @xmath36 .",
    "recall that @xmath236 is proportional to the flow density @xmath86 .",
    "gas of higher density has a greater volumetric recombination rate , and thus absorbs more ionizing photons per time to maintain ionization balance . since the density falls with distance @xmath36 ,",

    ", the hii region first undergoes pressure - driven expansion , but then remains trapped , i.e. , density - bounded , on all sides .",
    "alternatively , with a much higher luminosity and/or lower cloud density , an outflow may erupt on _ both _ sides of our model planar slab .",
    "such a bipolar morphology is harder to achieve , in part because of the values of cloud density and stellar luminosity required , and in part because real clouds do not have a slab geometry , i.e. , they are not infinite in lateral extent .",
    "increasing the stellar luminosity in an originally monopolar flow usually just widens the ionization front , without creating another outflow lobe .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that out of the hundreds of uchii regions that have been identified , only a handful have a bipolar morphology @xcite .    given their relative scarcity , we forgo a parameter study of this type of uchii region , and focus instead on the simplest example . here",

    "however , we find that @xmath173 does not lead to a bipolar flow .",
    "to be safe , we have raised @xmath18 to 3 .    in order to generate this solution",
    ", we began with the fact that @xmath241 , as demanded by symmetry .",
    "we guessed @xmath242 , the flow density at the midplane , and then used these two starting values as the initial conditions for integrating the coupled first - order equations ( [ dudznondimensional ] ) and ( [ dndznondimensional ] ) . as before , we use equation ( [ injectionvelocitynondimensional ] ) to obtain the injection velocity .",
    "since @xmath71 does not vanish at the base , the righthand sides of ( [ dudznondimensional ] ) and ( [ dndznondimensional ] ) are well - behaved at the start , and the integration is relatively straightforward . using the method of shooting and splitting , we refine our guess for the starting ionized density until we approach the sonic point .",
    "we jump over this point in just the manner described in section [ solutionstrategy ] .",
    "figure [ bipolarifront ] shows the symmetric ionization front for this model .",
    "the two sets of horizontal lines show the location of the sonic transitions and the pressure crossover points , respectively .",
    "we notice immediately how close these points are to one another ( compare fig .",
    "[ fiducialifront ] ) . this same feature is apparent in figure [ bipolardensityandvelocity ] , which displays the density and velocity profiles . the velocity , which is an odd function of the height @xmath36 , reaches unity just before the curve ends at the pressure crossover .",
    "the ionized density @xmath147 is symmetric about @xmath237 and has a shape similar to that of the neutral cloud , peaking at the midplane .    in this outflow , neutral gas with a pressure exceeding that of the ionized gas",
    "is drawn in laterally through the ionization front .",
    "the ionized gas flows away in a symmetric manner from its region of maximal density at the midplane .",
    "radiation pressure never acts to decelerate the flow , as in the monopolar case .",
    "rather , it contributes to the acceleration , consequently reducing the ionized density gradient .",
    "nevertheless , the thermal pressure gradient remains the strongest driving force .",
    "as mentioned previously , attempts to lower @xmath18 closer to 1 resulted in failure to obtain a transonic solution .",
    "specifically , the pressure crossover point was reached before the sonic transition .",
    "we found this result for any guess of the starting ionized density below @xmath243 , i.e. for ionized pressures at the midplane less than the corresponding cloud pressure .",
    "our inability to find transonic solutions in this regime suggests that the true steady - state solution is not an outflow , but a trapped hii region in which the interior and cloud pressures match .      up to this point",
    "we have taken our molecular cloud to be a planar slab , a geometry that is convenient mathematically , but not truly representative of the clouds found in nature .",
    "there exist no detailed studies of infrared dark cloud morphologies . in the realm of low - mass star formation",
    ", recent observations of gould belt clouds reveal that a tangled network of filaments creates the dense cores that in turn collapse to form stars @xcite .",
    "thus , a more realistic model for our background cloud might be a cylinder in force balance between self - gravity and turbulent pressure .",
    "if the interior velocity dispersion is again spatially uniform , as we have assumed , then the density falls with a power law with distance from the central axis , as opposed to the much steeper , exponential falloff we have employed until now .    our model is flexible enough that we can explore various functional forms for the cloud density profile .",
    "however , our cloud is still a one - dimensional slab , so that the density @xmath244 is a function of @xmath36 , the distance from the midplane .",
    "we construct a `` pseudo - cylindrical '' cloud , which has the density profile of a self - gravitating , isothermal cylinder @xcite , but with the cylindrical radius @xmath71 replaced by @xmath36 . in this model ,",
    "the dimensional number density and gravitational potential are @xmath245 ^{-2 } \\,\\",
    ", , \\ ] ] @xmath246 \\ , \\ , .\\ ] ] here @xmath225 is again the distance between the star and the cloud midplane , and @xmath247 is the scale height in equation ( [ scaleheight ] ) is a factor of @xmath248 larger than that used in @xcite . ] .",
    "choosing @xmath173 and @xmath249 , we could not achieve a transonic flow , if we also used the fiducial @xmath240 .",
    "in retrospect , this result could have been anticipated , since the pseudo - cylindrical model has a smaller column density , as measured from the midplane , than the slab model with the same @xmath44 .",
    "we therefore utilized @xmath250 in the pseudo - cylindrical case , for which we could indeed find a transonic solution . for comparison , we ran a slab model with @xmath251 , which has the same column density as the pseudo - cylinder .",
    "the two density profiles , both non - dimensional , are displayed together in figure [ clouddensity ] .",
    "figure [ cylindricalifront ] compares the ionization front shapes for the two cloud models . because of its relatively high @xmath44-value , the ionization front in this slab model is more flared than in the fiducial one ( recall fig .",
    "[ ifrontvaryeverything ] ) .",
    "the degree of flaring in the pseudo - cylindrical case is much less , a consequence of the gentler falloff in the cloud density profile .",
    "finally , figure [ densityandvelocityvarygeometry ] compares the density and velocity profiles within the flows themselves .",
    "the flow density within the pseudo - cylinder starts out lower and falls off more slowly . since the thermal pressure gradient is reduced , so is the acceleration of the ionized gas .",
    "as seen in the lower panel of the figure , the velocity begins at a more subsonic value and thereafter climbs less steeply .",
    "one way to compare our model with observations is to generate synthetic contour maps of the radio continuum emission measure .",
    "the latter is the integral of @xmath252 with respect to distance along each line of sight that penetrates the outflow .",
    "the resulting maps may also be compared to those generated by other theoretical models , such as the ones of @xcite ( @xcite ; fig .",
    "3 ) and @xcite ( @xcite ; fig .",
    "7 ) ,    figure [ emcontours ] displays a series of emission measure maps at different viewing angles , all using our fiducial model . here , the inclination angle @xmath27 is that between the flow s central ( @xmath36- ) axis and the line of sight .",
    "the star , as always , lies at the origin , and the spatial coordinates are non - dimensional .    for a flow oriented in the plane of the sky ( @xmath253 ) , the brightest emission occurs near the base of the flow , where the ionized gas is relatively dense .",
    "the precise location of the peak emission point depends on two competing factors .",
    "the width of the ionized flow monotonically increases with @xmath36 , while the @xmath252 decreases . in practice",
    ", the peak emission is located about midway between the flow base and the star .",
    "the latter two points are separated by a physical distance of about @xmath254 ( recall eq .",
    "( [ fiduciallength ] ) ) .",
    "the peak emission measure for our fiducial model is @xmath255 @xmath7 pc .",
    "when @xmath63 is lowered by a factor of 10 , as in table 1 , the peak emission measure drops to @xmath256 @xmath7 pc .",
    "suppose , on the other hand , we fix @xmath257 at its fiducial value while increasing @xmath44 and concurrently decreasing @xmath169 in the manner described below equation ( [ mdotscalingsummary ] ) .",
    "then we find that the peak emission measure reaches @xmath258 @xmath7 pc for an @xmath44 of @xmath259 .",
    "of the 15 cometaries in @xcite with estimated peak emission measures , the figure varies from @xmath260 to @xmath261 @xmath7 pc .",
    "of the 12 cometaries in @xcite with estimated peak emission measures , they vary from @xmath262 to @xmath263 @xmath7 pc . thus our model , including reasonable parameter variations , yields peak emission measures that fall within the middle range of observed values .    as the @xmath36-axis tips toward the line of sight , the emission becomes fainter .",
    "the reason is that the total emission measure along any line of sight is increasingly weighted by more rarefied gas at higher values of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , as seen in figure [ emcontours ] , the contours representing higher values of the emission measure successively disappear as @xmath27 decreases .",
    "for @xmath27 close to zero , the shape of the remaining contours is nearly spherical .",
    "however , our synthetic maps fail to reproduce the `` shell '' or `` core - halo '' morphologies identified by @xcite .",
    "the latter have pronounced limb brightening . as previously noted by @xcite ,",
    "champagne - flow models have difficulty explaining this feature .",
    "returning to generic cometary regions , our model fits their morphology quite well .",
    "figure  [ radiocomparison ] compares our fiducial flow ( with @xmath253 ) to an emission map taken from the survey of @xcite .",
    "this specific uchii region has an estimated distance of 16.1 kpc .",
    "accordingly , our synthetic map is displayed in angular coordinates .",
    "we could , in principle , make more precise fits to both this region and many others , by tuning our three free parameters and the viewing angle . here , we do not attempt such a detailed , comprehensive matching .      as explained at the outset of section [ densityandpotential ]",
    ", we calculate a laterally - averaged ionized gas velocity at each @xmath36-location within our model hii region . for this reason , we can not attempt to match detailed observations of uchii velocities along particular lines of sight .",
    "nevertheless , we do reproduce several broad characteristics of some uchii regions .",
    "our model yields a transonic flow that proceeds along the cometary axis , with steep acceleration from head to tail .",
    "a similar pattern is seen in the objects observed by @xcite . for our fiducial cometary uchii region ,",
    "the velocity gradient we compute is 8 km s@xmath0 pc@xmath0 , about a factor of 2 lower than the gradient measured in g32.80 @xmath264 0.19 .",
    "however , as is evident in our figure [ velocityvaryn0andzeta ] , raising the cloud density and decreasing the displacement of the star from the midplane can give a velocity gradient substantially larger than our fiducial one .",
    "for the bipolar case , we find steady acceleration in both directions along the central axis .",
    "@xcite observed this feature in several bipolar compact hii regions .",
    "the velocity gradient we compute for our fiducial bipolar model is 50 km s@xmath0 pc@xmath0 , about one third the gradient measured in the compact bipolar hii region k3 - 50a @xcite .",
    "like all champagne - flow models , ours predicts that the ionized and molecular gas should be closest in velocity near the head of the cometary region , and that the two velocities should grow farther apart down the tail of the ionized region .",
    "this is not the case for g13.87 @xmath265 , for which the ionized velocity closely approaches the molecular cloud velocity in the tail , a characteristic of bowshock models @xcite .",
    "however , in g32.80 + .19 , the central line emission of the ionized gas in the tail shows accelerates to a speed at least 6 km s@xmath0 greater than that of the molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "this systematic increase is more consistent with a champagne flow .    for completeness",
    ", we note that there exist a number of cometary uchii regions for which neither a champagne flow nor bowshock accurately accounts for the detailed velocity structure .",
    "one well - studied example is g29.96 - 02 @xcite .",
    "objects such as these have motivated numerical simulations in which a champagne flow is combined with a stellar wind and motion of the star itself through a molecular cloud @xcite .    in summary , a pure champagne flow model such as",
    "ours is inadequate to explain all the observed features of cometary uchii regions .",
    "we are encouraged , however , that the main characteristics are well produced .",
    "in addition , the simplicity of our quasi - one dimensional model in comparison with multidimensional numerical simulations , allows a much broader exploration of parameter space that will aid in a general understanding of the phenomenon .",
    "we have explored a quasi - one dimensional , steady - state wind model for uchii regions .",
    "this picture offers a natural explanation for the cometary morphology that is frequently observed .",
    "we are also able to match , at least broadly , such basic observational quantities as the diameter of the region , its peak emission measure , and the ionized gas velocity .",
    "additionally , we have employed the model to see how the density and velocity structure of the region respond to changes in the stellar luminosity , molecular cloud density , and displacement of the exciting star from the peak molecular density .",
    "checking these trends against observations is a task for the future .    in our view",
    ", the very young , massive star creating the ionization is still buried deep within within a large molecular cloud .",
    "ionizing photons from the star steadily erode the cloud , expelling gas at a rate of order @xmath1 @xmath2  yr@xmath0 .",
    "consequently , over the inferred uchii lifetimes of order @xmath8  yr , the star drives out only a relatively small amount of cloud gas , representing the dense clump in which it was born . as time goes on",
    ", we expect the flow to grow in size , with the mass expulsion rate concurrently rising .",
    "the ionized gas just inside the ionization front is underpressured with respect to the surrounding neutral material . indeed , it is just this pressure difference that draws in more neutral material and sustains the wind .",
    "@xcite observe just such a difference in the uchii region g35.20 - 1.74 . in our model , this pressure difference is _ not _ due to the generation of a shock by the expanding hii region as in the classical model for d - type fronts ( spitzer @xcite , chapter 12 ) .",
    "such a shock probably did form earlier in the evolution of the uchii region , but has died away by the time a steady flow is established .",
    "our semi - analytic model necessarily entails simplifying assumptions .",
    "one is our neglect of the stellar wind , which could partially excavate the ionized region .",
    "in over half the objects studied in @xcite , the ionized gas appears to be skirting around a central cavity , possibly indicating the influence of the wind . note also that a wind would produce an additional shock near the front , elevating the pressure difference .",
    "we have also assumed a steady - state flow in which we neglect the relatively slow advance of the ionization front into the molecular cloud .",
    "recall that equation ( [ cloudvelocity ] ) gives @xmath90 , the incoming velocity of cloud gas in the frame of the ionization front . using a typical injection speed of @xmath266 , along with @xmath267 and @xmath268 , we find that @xmath269 km s@xmath0 , which is indeed small compared to the effective cloud sound speed of 2 km s@xmath0 .",
    "however , over the @xmath8  yr lifetime of the uchii region , the front advances by 0.02 pc , an appreciable fraction of the region s diameter .",
    "a more complete calculation would account for the motion of this front , through retention of the flux leakage term in equation ( [ raytracingrewritten ] ) .    in the future",
    ", both our type of semi - analytic model and multidimensional numerical simulations can play valuable roles . extending the present calculation",
    ", one could follow the spread of ionization to see how the hii region grows and disperses the bulk of the molecular cloud .",
    "simulations can eventually provide a more realistic picture of the parent cloud .",
    "in particular , we see a need to explore the role of turbulence , which we have treated simplistically as providing an enhanced , isotropic pressure . as @xcite have shown , the advance of an hii region into a turbulent cloud is quite different from the classical account . within our model , the wind itself may not be a laminar flow , as we have assumed .",
    "inclusion of these effects may be necessary to explain the more extreme members of the irregular uchii class identified by @xcite .",

    "<S> recent , time - dependent simulations of massive stars turning on within molecular gas show the system evolving in a direction similar to that just described . here </S>",
    "<S> , we explore a semi - analytic model in which the wind is axisymmetric and has already achieved a steady state . </S>",
    "<S> adoption of this simplified picture allows us to study the dependence of both the wind and its bounding ionization front on the stellar luminosity , the peak molecular density , and the displacement of the star from the center of the clump . for typical parameter values </S>",
    "<S> , the wind accelerates transonically to a speed of about 15  km  s@xmath0 , and transports mass outward at a rate of @xmath1 @xmath2 yr@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> stellar radiation pressure acts to steepen the density gradient of the wind . </S>"
