    "one of the most difficult problems facing simulations in science and mathematics is to be able to simulate time and length scales comparable to those found in nature , those required for engineering applications , and those accessible to experiments . in this paper",
    "a method to obtain extremely long simulations for discrete systems is reviewed .",
    "this method , which merges the ideas of absorbing markov chains with those of kinetic monte carlo simulations , is called the mcamc algorithm ( monte carlo with absorbing markov chains ) @xcite .",
    "it expands on the ideas put forward by bortz , kalos , and lebowitz @xcite in a method called the @xmath0-fold way .",
    "the mcamc algorithm with a single transient state ( which corresponds to the current state of the configuration ) is the discrete - time version of the @xmath0-fold way algorithm @xcite .    as an application requiring long - time simulations ,",
    "consider the problem of thermal reversal of nanoscale ferromagnetic grains .",
    "for highly anisotropic materials each region of the ferromagnet may be considered to have two states corresponding to two discrete directions .",
    "this gives an ising model as an approximate hamiltonian for ferromagnetic nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "starting from a quantum hamiltonian of spin @xmath1 particles interacting with a heat bath , it is possible to derive in certain limits a physical dynamic for the model @xcite .",
    "this dynamic has two parts : first a spin is chosen uniformly from all the spins , then the spin is flipped with some probability @xmath2 that depends on the temperature @xmath3 and the applied magnetic field @xmath4 .",
    "one algorithmic step is called a monte carlo step ( mcs ) and corresponds to one spin - flip attempt . for a system with @xmath5 ising spins , the simulation time is often given in monte carlo steps per spin ( mcss ) , which corresponds to @xmath5 mcs .    with coupling to a fermionic heat bath @xcite , the probability @xmath2 is the glauber transition probability @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath6 $ ] where @xmath7 ( with bolztmann s constant set to one ) , @xmath8 is the energy of the configuration with the ising spin flipped and @xmath9 is the energy of the current spin configuration of the system .",
    "a different probability ( which also satisfies detailed balance ) for coupling to a @xmath10-dimensional bath of phonons has been recently derived @xcite .",
    "the reason long - time simulations are required is now readily apparent .",
    "the underlying algorithmic step corresponds to an inverse phonon frequency , about @xmath11  seconds .",
    "the time scale for simulation must be on the order of years to decades for simulations applicable to magnetic recording  basically simulations at least as long as data integrity for a written bit of information .",
    "for paleomagnetism simulations , time periods of millions of years must be achievable .",
    "the typical clock speed of a computer is @xmath12  seconds .",
    "consequently , faster - than - real - time simulations are required for realistic feasible simulations .",
    "note that these faster - than - real - time algorithms _ can not _ change the dynamic which has been derived starting from the quantum hamiltonian .",
    "hence advanced algorithms that are used in static simulations , such as reweighting techniques , the swendsen - wang algorithm , multicanonical methods , or simulated tempering @xcite can not be used  they would change the underlying dynamic . rather , the physical dynamic described above must be implemented on the computer in a more intelligent fashion than a brute - force method .",
    "this paper describes only the mcamc algorithm and results obtained from it for low - temperature ising simulations .",
    "two other recent advances using rejection - free methods should be mentioned @xcite .",
    "one is to use massively parallel computers in such simulations @xcite .",
    "another is to generalize the rejection - free algorithms to continuous systems , such as heisenberg spin systems @xcite .",
    "2 describes the mcamc algorithm for the simple cubic ( sc ) nearest - neighbor ( nn ) ising model .",
    "the generalization to other discrete systems is straightforward . in sec .",
    "3 low - temperature predictions for the ising model are reviewed .",
    "sections 4 and 5 present results for low - temperature metastable lifetimes in @xmath10@xmath13@xmath14 and @xmath10@xmath13@xmath15 .",
    "5 contains conclusions .",
    "we simulate the nn ising model with hamiltonian @xmath16 with @xmath17@xmath18@xmath19 the ferromagnetic coupling constant , the first sum running over all nn pairs , and the second sum running over all @xmath5 spins .",
    "we consider only the case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the simulation starts with all spins @xmath20 ( all spins up ) , and a field @xmath21 ( external field down ) is applied .",
    "the magnetization is @xmath22 .",
    "we measure the time @xmath23 to go from the starting state to a state with @xmath24 .",
    "this simulation is repeated many times ( for this paper 1000 times ) for the same @xmath3 and @xmath4 values to obtain the average lifetime @xmath25 of the metastable state .    for the sc lattice for every configuration each spin",
    "can be classified to be in one of @xmath26 possible classes .",
    "( for the square - lattice ising model there are @xmath27 classes . )",
    "the spin is either up or down , and we label the first 7 classes with spin up and classes 8 through 14 with spin down .",
    "the other factor determining the class of a spin is the number of nn spins that are up , which can be any integer from zero to 6 .",
    "let class  1 have 6 nn spins up , class  2 5 nn spins up , etc .",
    "class 8 has 6 nn spins up , @xmath28 , class 14 has 0 nn spins up .",
    "let @xmath29 be the number of spin in class @xmath30 .",
    "then @xmath31 . let @xmath32 be the probability of flipping a spin in class @xmath30 , given that the spin was chosen during the first part of the dynamic algorithm .",
    "then the probability of flipping any of the spins in class @xmath30 in one mcs is @xmath33 since @xmath34 is the probability of choosing a spin from class @xmath30 .    in order to exit from the current spin configuration ,",
    "one of the spins in one of the @xmath26 classes must be flipped .",
    "define @xmath35 for each of the @xmath26 spin classes , and @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the integer part of a number .",
    "the discrete @xmath0-fold way algorithm has three steps .",
    "first , the time @xmath38 to exit from the current configuration ( in unit of mcs ) is determined by @xmath39 with @xmath40 a random number uniformly distributed between zero and one",
    ". then using a different uniformly distributed random number @xmath41 the spin class @xmath42 is chosen such that it satisfies @xmath43 finally , using a third uniformly distributed random number , one of the @xmath44 spins in class @xmath42 is chosen , and this spin is flipped .",
    "of course , the flipped spin changes its class , as do its 6 nn spins .",
    "this means that the numbers @xmath29 change after one algorithmic step .",
    "the first two steps of the discrete @xmath0-fold way algorithm correspond to having an absorbing markov chain with @xmath26 states in the recurrent matrix with elements given by the probability to exit from the current spin configuration by choosing and flipping a spin in class @xmath30 , namely @xmath33 .",
    "the transient subspace of the absorbing markov matrix is a scalar ( @xmath45 ) given by the matrix @xmath46 .",
    "the time in the @xmath45 mcamc simulation corresponds to the time required to leave the current spin configuration . at low temperatures",
    "this time may be extremely long ( if @xmath47 is very small ) , and the algorithmic speed - up obtained in the simulation can be many orders of magnitude .",
    "the simulation starts with all spins up .",
    "in one algorithmic step the @xmath45 mcamc described above exits from this state with a probability @xmath48 ( since all spins are up , @xmath49 for this state ) . for low temperatures and @xmath50 the most probable thing that happens in the next algorithmic step",
    "is that the flipped spin is again chosen and the next configuration is again all spins up .",
    "this occurs with probability ratio @xmath51 . by increasing the size of the transient subspace of the absorbing markov chain , it is possible to exit the absorbing markov chain in a configuration with more than one spin flipped .",
    "for example , the absorbing markov matrix to exit from the state with all spins up into a state with two spins flipped has two states in the transient subspace ( @xmath52 ) with the transient matrix @xmath53 and the recurrent matrix @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "the ratio to exit to a state with two nn spins overturned to that to exit to a state with two non - nn spins overturned is @xmath56 .",
    "the vector representing the initial state of all spins up is @xmath57 , and the probability to be in each of the two transient states after one time step is @xmath58 .",
    "the first transient state ( lower right - hand corner of the matrix ) is the state with all spins up , and the other state ( upper left - hand corner of the matrix ) corresponds to the @xmath5 states that have one overturned spin . by adding more states to the transient subspace longer times to exit the transient subspace are possible .",
    "the time @xmath38 ( in mcs ) to exit from the transient subspace is found from the solution of the equation @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the vector of length @xmath61 with all elements equal to unity .",
    "the probability that the system ends up in a particular absorbing state is given by the elements of the vector @xmath62 with the fundamental matrix @xmath63 .",
    "to obtain very long lifetimes , a multiple precision package was used @xcite . to keep bookkeeping overhead to a minimum , for the ising simulations below , only @xmath45 mcamc",
    "was used except when the spin configuration had all spins up , then higher @xmath61 mcamc ( up to @xmath64 ) was used .",
    "at very low temperatures the kinetic ising simulations are influenced by the discreteness of the lattice .",
    "this allows for the exact calculation of the saddle point as well as the most probable route to the saddle point @xcite .",
    "for the square lattice @xcite with @xmath65 the average lifetime ( in units of mcs ) at low temperature is given by @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "the prefactor , @xmath68 , was determined to be @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 @xcite .",

    "hence the nucleating droplet for the square lattice is a rectangle of overturned spins of size @xmath75 with one overturned spin on a long interface . at low enough temperature ,",
    "this result for @xmath25 should hold everywhere , except when @xmath76 is an integer .",
    "note that the prefactor is discontinuous for the special values where @xmath76 is an integer .    for the sc lattice ,",

    "these data indicate that both the value of @xmath98 and the prefactor agree at low enough temperatures with the simulation data .",
    "however , exactly how low is low enough to agree with the data depends on the value of @xmath87 . in particular , for values far from the special value where @xmath104 changes , the mcamc values agree with the low - temperature predictions even for temperatures as large as @xmath105 ( note @xmath106 ) .",
    "however , closer to the special value where @xmath104 changes much lower temperatures are needed before agreement with the low - temperature predictions are seen .",

    "the monte carlo with absorbing markov chains ( mcamc ) algorithm for long - time simulations of dynamics was described .",
    "the description was for the sc ising ferromagnet , but can be generalized to other discrete systems .",
    "the @xmath45 mcamc algorithm corresponds to the @xmath0-fold way algorithm @xcite in discrete time @xcite . in many cases",

    "the @xmath120 mcamc can require many _ orders of magnitude _ less computer time than the @xmath45 mcamc .",
    "these exponential decreases in computer time are accomplished _ without _ changing the underlying dynamic .",
    "the mcamc algorithm has been applied to check the low - temperature predictions for metastable decay in both the square and sc ising ferromagnet .",
    "in particular , the predicted discontinuity in the average lifetime at the values of @xmath87 where the size of the droplet at the saddle point changes discontinuously was investigated .",
    "it was found that for the square lattice , where the discontinuity is only in the prefactor , a finite temperature simulation sees no evidence of this prefactor discontinuity . instead",
    ", the temperature at which the simulations must be performed to see the low - temperature predictions decreases as the discontinuity is approached . for the sc lattice a discontinuity in both the prefactor and in the energy of the nucleating droplet was predicted @xcite .",
    "no evidence for these discontinuities were found in the simulation data .",
