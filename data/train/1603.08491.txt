    "the leading approach in content - centric networking consists of : populating forwarding information bases ( fib ) maintained by routers with routes to name prefixes denoting content , sending content requests ( called interests ) for specific content objects ( co ) over paths implied by the fibs , and delivering data packets with content objects along the reverse paths traversed by interests .",
    "the main advantages that such interest - based content - centric networking approach offers compared to the ip internet are that : ( a ) content providers and caching sites do not know the identity of the consumers requesting content ; ( b ) content can be obtained by name from those sites that are closer to consumers ; ( c ) data packets carrying content can not traverse loops , because they are sent over the reverse paths traversed by interests ; and ( d ) content - oriented security mechanisms can be implemented as part of the content delivery mechanisms .    named data networking ( ndn ) @xcite and ccnx @xcite are the two prominent interest - based content - centric networking approaches .",
    "routers in ndn and ccnx maintain a  stateful forwarding plane \" @xcite ( i.e. , per - interest forwarding state ) by means of pending interest tables ( pit ) .",
    "the pit of a router maintains information regarding the incoming interfaces from which interests for a co were received and the interfaces where the interest for the same co was forwarded .",
    "since the inception of ccnx and ndn , pits have been viewed as necessary in order to maintain routes to the origins of interests while preserving the anonymity of those sources , aggregate interests requesting the same content in order to attain efficient interest and content forwarding , and support multicasting without additional support in the control plane .    however",
    ", using pits at internet scale comes at a big price .",
    "pits grow very large @xcite as the number of interests from users increases , which results from pits having to store per - interest forwarding state .",
    "furthermore , pits make routers vulnerable to interest - flooding attacks @xcite in which adversaries send malicious interests aimed at making the size of pits explode .",
    "known countermeasures to these attacks @xcite attempt to reduce the rates at which suspected routers can forward interests . however , these solutions can not prevent all flooding attacks and can actually be used to mount other types of denial - of - service attacks .",
    "section  [ sec - prelim ] analyzes the effectiveness of interest aggregation in ndn by means of simulations based on the implementation of ndn in ndnsim @xcite without modifications .",
    "the results show that the percentage of interests that are aggregated is negligible when in - network caching is enabled , even when interests exhibit temporal or spatial correlation .    given that in - network caching obviates the need for interest aggregation , and given the vulnerability of ndn and ccnx to interest - flooding attacks ,",
    "it is clear that a new interest forwarding approach is needed for content - centric networking .",
    "we present * ccn - gram * ( _ gathering of routes for anonymous messengers _ ) , which provides all the benefits of content - centric networking , including native support for multicasting in the data plane , and eliminates the need to maintain per - interest forwarding state by forwarding interests and responses to them using _ anonymous _ datagrams .",
    "section [ sec - design ] describes the operation of ccn - gram . like ndn and ccnx",
    ", ccn - gram uses interests , data packets , and replies to interests .",
    "similar to ip datagrams , the messages sent in ccn - gram specify a source and a destination .",
    "for an interest , the source of an interest is an anonymous identifier with local context and the destination is the name of a content object . for data packets and replies to interests ,",
    "the source is the name of a content object and the destination is an anonymous identifier .",
    "a novel on - demand routing approach is used to maintain routes to the anonymous routers that originate interests for specific content on behalf of local content consumers .",
    "only the local router serving a user knows the identity of the user ; no other router , content provider , or caching site can determine the consumer that originated an interest , without routers collaborating along the path traversed by the interests to establish the provenance of the interest .",
    "in contrast to ndn and ccnx in which interests may traverse forwarding loops @xcite , forwarding loops can not occur in ccn - gram for either interests or responses sent to interests , even if the fibs maintained by routers contain inconsistent forwarding state involving routing - table loops .",
    "furthermore , the anonymous datagram forwarding of ccn - gram is much simpler than the label - swapping approach we have advocated before @xcite .",
    "forwarding of interests and responses to them in ccn - gram uses four tables : a light ( local interests gathered table ) , a fib , an art ( anonymous routing table ) and a list ( local interval set table ) .",
    "the light of a router is an index listing content that is locally available and content that is remote and has been requested by _",
    "local _ users .",
    "the fib of each router states the next hops to each name prefix and the distance to the name prefix reported by each next hop .",
    "the art is maintained using interests and states the paths to destinations denoted with local identifiers from which routers can not discern the origin of interests .",
    "the list states the intervals of local identifiers that a router assigns to its neighbors and that each neighbor assigns to the router .",
    "section [ sec - perf ] compares the performance of ccn - gram with ndn when routes to name prefixes are static and loop - free , which is the best case for ndn .",
    "the network consists of 150 routers , with 10 being connected to content producers and 50 being connected to consumers .",
    "ccn - gram attains similar end - to - end latencies than ndn in retrieving content .",
    "however , depending on the rate at which interests are submitted , ccn - gram requires an average number of forwarding entries per router that is 5 to more than150 times smaller than the number of pit entries needed in ndn .",
    "routers in ndn use interests , data packets , and negative acknowledgments ( nack ) to exchange content .",
    "an interest is identified in ndn by the name of the co requested and a nonce created by the origin of the interest .",
    "a data packet includes the co name , a security payload , and the payload itself .",
    "a nack carries the information needed to denote an interest and a code stating the reason for the response .",
    "a router @xmath0 uses three data structures to process interests , data packets , and nacks : a content store ( @xmath1 ) , a forwarding information base ( @xmath2 ) , and a pending interest table ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "a @xmath1 is a cache for cos indexed by their names . with on - path caching",
    ", routers cache the content they receive in response to interests they forward .",
    "a @xmath2 is populated using content routing protocols @xcite or static routes and a router matches interest names stating a specific co to @xmath2 entries corresponding to prefix names using _ longest prefix match_. the fib entry for a given name prefix lists the interfaces that can be used to reach the prefix . in ndn , a fib entry also contains additional information @xcite .",
    "the entry in a @xmath3 for a given co consists of one or multiple tuples stating a nonce received in an interest for the co , the incoming interface where it was received , and a list of the outgoing interfaces over which the interest was forwarded .",
    "when a router receives an interest , it checks whether there is a match in its cs for the co requested in the interest .",
    "the interest matching mechanisms used can vary , and for simplicity we focus on exact interest matching only .",
    "if a match to the interest is found , the router sends back a data packet over the reverse path traversed by the interest .",
    "if no match is found in the cs , the router determines whether the pit stores an entry for the same content .    in ndn , if the interest states a nonce that differs from those stored in the pit entry for the requested content , then the router ",
    "aggregates \" the interest by adding the incoming interface from which the interest was received and the nonce to the pit entry without forwarding the interest .",
    "if the same nonce in the interest is already listed in the pit entry for the requested co , the router sends a nack over the reverse path traversed by the interest .",
    "if a router does not find a match in its cs and pit , the router forwards the interest along a route ( or routes ) listed in its fib for the best prefix match . in ndn",
    ", a router can select an interface to forward an interest if it is known that it can bring content and its performance is ranked higher than other interfaces that can also bring content .",
    "we analyze the likelihood that interest aggregation occurs in the presence of in - network caching in ndn using simulations carried out with the ndn implementation in ndnsim @xcitewithout modifications .",
    "a more detailed analysis is presented in @xcite .",
    "our study is independent of the interest retransmission strategy , and uses the percentage of aggregated interests in the network as the performance metric . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that routers use exact interest matching to decide whether an interest can be answered .",
    "we consider the average latencies between routers , the capacity of caches , the interest request rates from routers , the popularity of content , and the temporal correlation of content requests .",
    "the scenarios we use consist of random networks with 200 nodes corresponding to routers distributed uniformly in a 100m@xmath4100 m area .",
    "routers with 12 m or shorter distance are connected to each other with a point - to - point link , which results in a topology with 1786 edges .",
    "each router acts as a producer of content and also has local consumers generating interests .",
    "producers are assumed to publish 1,000,000 different content objects that are uniformly distributed among routers . for simplicity , we assume that _ all _ routers have the same storage capacity in their caches , which depending on the experiment ranges from 0 to up to 100,000 cache entries per router , or 10% of the published objects .",
    "the distribution of object requests determines how many interests from different users request the same content .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that internet traffic follows a zipf distribution with a parameter ( @xmath5 ) value close to 1 .",
    "a smaller zipf parameter value results in a lower interest aggregation amount .",
    "accordingly , we model object popularity using a zipf distribution with values of @xmath5 equal to 0.7 and 1 .",
    "we considered different values of the _ total interest rate per router _ , corresponding to the sum of interests from all local users .",
    "increasing values of interest rates can be viewed as higher request rates from a constant user population of local active users per router , or an increasing population of active users per router .",
    "for example , 50 to 500 interests per second per router can be just 10 interests per second per active user for a local population of 5 to 50 concurrently active users per router .",
    "the interest rates we assume per router are not large compared to recent results on the size that pits would have in realistic settings @xcite .    the percentage of interests that benefit from interest aggregation is a function of the rtt between the router originating the interest and the site with the requested content , as well as the pit entry expiration time when the interest is not answered with a data packet or a nack .",
    "recent internet latency statistics @xcite show that internet traffic latency varies from 11ms for regional european traffic to 160ms for long - distance traffic .",
    "accordingly , we consider point - to - point delays of 10ms between neighbor routers in many of our simulations , which leads to rtts of about 200ms .",
    "we also carried experiments varying the rtt of the network below and above 200ms .",
    "the following simulation results can be viewed as applicable to the steady - state behavior of a network using ndn .",
    "figure [ alpha - rtt ] shows the effect of the @xmath5 parameter and rtts when the request rate per router is 50 interests per second .",
    "the latencies between neighbor routers are set to 5 and 15 ms , which produce rtts of 66 to 70 ms and 193 to 200 ms , respectively .",
    "it is clear that interest aggregation is far less important when consumers are less likely to request similar content ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "furthermore , the benefits of interest aggregation vanish as caches are allowed to cache more content .",
    "when caches can store up to 1% of the total number of objects published , the percentage of interests that are aggregated is less than 2% for @xmath7 and less than 0.8% for @xmath6 .    in theory ,",
    "interest aggregation is most useful when interests exhibit temporal correlation , such as when popular live events take place .",
    "figure [ localized ] shows the impact of caching on interest aggregation when interests have temporal correlation and either no caching is used or caches with capacity for only 0.1% of the objects published in the network are used .",
    "interests are generated using the model proposed by dabirmoghaddam et al @xcite with a zipf parameter value of @xmath6 and results for three total interest rates per router and four temporal localization factors for interests are shown .",
    "a higher temporal locality factor indicates a higher degree of popularity of objects in the same time period .",
    "the results in figure [ localized ] show that , without caching , interest aggregation _ is _ very important for all values of temporal locality of interest popularity , and is more important when interest locality is high ( large localization factor ) . however , once caching is allowed and even if caches can store only up to 0.1% of the published objects , the percentage of aggregated interests is minuscule and actually decreases with the temporal correlation of interests .",
    "we assume that interests are retransmitted only by the consumers that originated them .",
    "we assume that routers use exact interest matching , and that a router that advertises being an origin of a name prefix stores all the content objects associated with that prefix at a local content store .",
    "routers know which interfaces are neighbor routers and which are local users , and forward interests on a best - effort basis . for convenience , it is assumed that a request for content from a local user is sent to its local router in the form of an interest .",

    "we also assume that consumers and routers differentiate between a multicast interest and an interest originated from a single consumer ( unicast interest ) .    a multicast interest @xmath89 $ ] sent by router @xmath11 to router @xmath47 states : the name of a multicast group @xmath90 , the distance from router @xmath11 to the source of the multicast group @xmath91 , and a multicast counter ( @xmath92 ) used for pacing .",
    "a multicast data packet @xmath93 $ ] states the name of the multicast group @xmath90 , a security payload @xmath18 , a multicast counter @xmath94 , plus the content payload .",
    "a multicast reply @xmath95 $ ] states the reason for the reply and the current value of the multicast counter .",
    "router @xmath11 maintains a multicast anonymous routing table ( @xmath96 ) that contains the forwarding state to the receivers of multicast groups .",
    "each entry in @xmath96 specifies a multicast group name , the value of the multicast counter ( @xmath97 ) , and a list of next hops to the group of receivers who have sent interests for the group .",
    "if router @xmath11 has local receivers for group @xmath90 , the entry for the group in @xmath96 includes router @xmath11 as a next hop to the receivers of the group .",
    "router @xmath11 also maintains a group membership table ( @xmath98 ) that lists the mappings of multicast group names to the lists of local receivers that requested to join the groups .",
    "the gmt entries allow the router to deliver multicast content to local receivers of specific groups .",
    "the key difference of the way in which ccn - gram forwards multicast traffic compared to ndn or ccnx is that a mart maintains per - group forwarding state , while a pit maintains per - interest forwarding state .",
    "figure [ gram3 ] illustrates the forwarding of multicast interests and multicast content in ccn - gram .",
    "there is no need for anonymous identifiers for multicast content forwarding , because all consumers of a group must receive the same multicast cos , which are forwarded using multicast group names .    a content consumer @xmath99 requests to join a multicast group @xmath90 as a receiver by sending a multicast interest @xmath100 $ ] with @xmath101 .",
    "if router @xmath11 has multiple local receivers or neighbor routers requesting to join the same multicast group @xmath90 , router @xmath11 forwards multicast interest @xmath102 $ ] only once towards the source of the multicast group @xmath90 based on the information in its fib .",
    "router @xmath11 simply adds new local consumers to the entry for @xmath90 in @xmath98 or new next hops to multicast receivers in @xmath96 .",
    "router @xmath11 forwards multicast data packets based on the group names stated in the packets and the next hop stored in its mart entries , and discards the data packet if no mart entry exists for the multicast group .",
    "a similar approach is used for replies to interests regarding multicast groups .",
    "the dissemination of multicast data packets over the mft of a multicast group can be of two types .",
    "a multicast source can push multicast data towards the receivers , or the receivers can pull data from the source by submitting interests .    * push - based dissemination : * the only forwarding state needed in ccn - gram for push - based multicast dissemination consists of the name of a multicast group and the names of the next hops towards the group receivers . in this mode ,",
    "the @xmath97 value of an entry in a mart is updated with each multicast data packet forwarded by the router towards the receivers .",
    "* pull - based dissemination : * ccn - gram can also support pull - based multicast dissemination with no need for per - interest forwarding state .",
    "an exemplary approach consists of a source - pacing algorithm based on the @xmath97 values carried in interests and data packets .",
    "each receiver increments the @xmath97 value of interests it sends for the group asking for the next piece of multicast content from the source .",
    "when router @xmath11 receives multicast interest @xmath103 $ ] from a neighbor router or a local content consumer @xmath42 , it forwards the interest only if @xmath104 , where @xmath60 is the current @xmath97 value stored in @xmath96 for the multicast group .",
    "router @xmath11 updates the @xmath97 value in @xmath96 as it forwards the interest , and subsequent interests with the same @xmath97 value of @xmath105 are simply dropped . as a result , each router in an mft forwards a single copy of any interest asking for the next multicast content object towards the source .",
    "this is like aggregating interests for a multicast group over the mft of the group , but with no need to store per - interest forwarding state .",
    "we compare the forwarding entries needed to forward interests and responses in ndn and ccn - gram , as well as the end - to - end delays incurred , using simulation experiments based on implementations of ndn and ccn - gram in the ndnsim simulation tool @xcite .",
    "the ndn implementation was used without modifications , and ccn - gram was implemented in the ndnsim tool following algorithms 1 to 4 .",
    "the network topology consists of 150 routers distributed uniformly in a 100 m @xmath4 100 m area and routers with distance of 15 m or less are connected with point - to - point links of delay 15ms .",
    "the data rates of the links are set to 1gbps to eliminate the effects that a sub - optimal implementation of ccn - gram or ndn may have on the results .",
    "only 10 routers chosen randomly are connected to local content producers of multiple name prefixes , 50 other routers are connected to local content consumers , and all routers act as relays .",
    "this choice was made to illustrate the existence of a  network edge \" and the fact that only a relatively small number of sites host content producers .",
    "interests are generated with a zipf distribution with parameter @xmath6 and producers are assumed to publish 1,000,000 different cos .",
    "each cache can store up to 1000 objects , or 0.1% of the content published in the network .",
    "this caching capacity was selected to compare on - path caching with edge caching when interests must be forwarded in the network , rather than being answered with locally cached content .",
    "we considered _ total interest rates per router _ of 50 , 100 , 500 , and 2000 objects per second corresponding to the sum of interests from the local consumers connected to a router .",
    "the increasing values of total request rates can be viewed as higher request rates from a constant user population of local active users per router , or an increasing population of active users per router .",
    "the interest rates we assume are actually very low according to recent results addressing the size that pits would have under realistic internet settings @xcite .",
    "we considered on - path caching and edge caching . for the case of on - path",
    "caching , every router on the path traversed by a data packet from the producer to the consumer caches the co in its local cache . on the other hand , with edge caching , only the router directly connected to the requesting consumer caches the resulting co. all caches are lru .",
    "figure [ sizepitvsart ] shows the average size and standard deviation of the sizes of pits , arts and lights on a logarithmic scale as functions of interest rates .",
    "the size of lights corresponds only to the number of local interests pending responses .",
    "the number of entries corresponding to content cached locally can be up to 1000 for both ndn and ccn - gram .",
    "as the figure shows , the size of pits grows dramatically as the rate of content requests increases , which is expected given that pits maintain per - interest forwarding state .",
    "by contrast , the size of arts , which is the only forwarding state stored by relay routers , is only a small fraction of the total number of routers and remains fairly constant with respect to the content request rates , which is always one or multiple orders of magnitude smaller than the average pit size .",
    "the size of lights is a function of the number of cos requested locally or cached on path , but the average size of a light is an order of magnitude smaller than the average size of a pit .",
    "the size of a art is independent of where content is being cached , given that an art entry is stored independently of how many interests traverse the route .",
    "interestingly , edge - caching renders only slightly larger pit sizes than on - path caching in ndn .",
    "figure [ delayoceanvsndn ] shows the average end - to - end delay for ndn and ccn - gram as a function of content request rates for on - path caching and edge caching .",
    "as the figure shows , the average delays for ndn and ccn - gram are comparable for all values of the content request rates . this should be expected , given that the static , loop - free routes in the fibs prevent interests to  wait to infinity \" in pits , the signaling overhead incurred by ndn and ccn - gram is similar , and in - network caching obviates the need for interest aggregation .",
    "we presented simulation results showing that interest aggregation rarely occurs when in - network caching is used .",
    "our analysis is limited ; however , our detailed characterization of interest aggregation via analytical modeling and simulation analysis @xcite renders the same conclusion .",
    "we introduced ccn - gram to eliminate the performance limitations associated with pits .",
    "ccn - gram is the first approach to interest - based content - centric networking that supports the forwarding of interests and responses to them using datagrams that do not reveal the identity of their origins to forwarding routers , caching sites , or content providers .",
    "simulation experiments were used to show that end - to - end delays incurred in ccn - gram and ndn are similar when either edge caching or on - path caching is used , but the storage requirements for ccn - gram are orders of magnitude smaller than for ndn .",
    "the results for ccn - gram indicate that it could be deployed with only routers at the edge maintaining lights and caches .",
    "additional work is needed to make the forwarding of interests in ccn - gram as efficient as the forwarding of responses to interests using arts .",
    "the goal is to enable interest forwarding at internet scale that does not require routers to look up fibs with billions of name - prefix entries as is the case in ndn and ccnx .",
    "both arts and pits must be updated when the paths traversed by interests and their responses must change due to congestion , topology changes , or mobility of consumers and providers .",
    "yi et al @xcite argue that per - interest forwarding state enables faster response to topology changes and congestion , because local repair mechanisms can be used .",
    "however , multipath routing , and dynamic load balancing schemes based on datagram forwarding have been shown to attain results very close to optimal routing @xcite and can be easily applied to ccn - gram in the future .",
    "ccn - gram can use the same content security features adopted in ccnx and ndn to limit or eliminate cache poisoning attacks , because it makes no modifications to the way in which content is protected in data packets or how a name can be securely linked to the payload of a co. however , ccn - gram enjoys an enormous advantage over ccnx and ndn in that it eliminates the ability for malicious users to mount interest - flooding attacks aimed at overwhelming the forwarding tables of routers @xcite .",
    "an art entry can be added only for valid local identifiers at each router and for routes that satisfy the ordering constraint imposed with lfr . given that both conditions are managed in the control plane",
    ", mounting attacks on arts is much more difficult than simply having users send interests for cos corresponding to valid name prefixes ."
