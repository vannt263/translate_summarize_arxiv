    "microscale and nanoscale solid state heat transfer as mediated by phonon transport has received considerable attention in connection with a number of diverse practical applications , such as heat management in microelectronic devices , passive cooling and thermoelectric energy conversion @xcite , but also due to the number of scientific challenges it poses . particularly notable",
    "is the wide range of scales present in these problems , typically starting from the atomistic ( including quantum ) and extending to the macroscopic ( device ) .",
    "kinetic - theory approaches based on the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) @xcite , especially if informed by ab - initio information on the material properties @xcite , can be quite effective in bridging this range of scales .",
    "one limitation of such approaches appears in the small mean free path limit , @xmath0 , where kinetic descriptions become stiff .",
    "here , @xmath1 denotes the knudsen number defined as the ratio of the mean free path to the characteristic system lengthscale ; a more precise definition will be given in section [ background ] .    as is well known , in the limit @xmath2 , the stiff boltzmann description need not be used because it can be replaced by the heat conduction equation ; derivation of the bulk thermal conductivity from the boltzmann equation in the relaxation approximation via a chapman - enskog type of expansion @xcite is well established , thus providing a `` pathway '' for recording the effect of molecular structure on the constitutive behavior in that limit .",
    "however , the chapman - enskog expansion is only applicable in the bulk and provides no information on the boundary conditions that need to supplement the heat conduction description in order to obtain solutions that are consistent with the ( more fundamental ) boltzmann solution .",
    "moreover , a rather large gap exists between lengthscales that truly satisfy @xmath3 and the regime where boltzmann equation solution is no longer problematic ( @xmath4 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we use an asymptotic expansion procedure using @xmath1 as a small parameter to derive , from the bte , the `` continuum '' equations governing phonon - mediated heat transfer in the small mean free path limit .",
    "this procedure recovers the classic heat conduction equation ( including fourier s law as a constitutive relation ) as the equation governing the temperature field that is consistent with solution of the boltzmann equation to order @xmath5 , as expected .",
    "however , in contrast to chapman - enskog - type procedures , this procedure , also _ derives _ the boundary conditions that the heat equation is to be solved subject to .",
    "specifically , for fixed temperature boundaries , the fourier boundary conditions are found to be of the dirichlet type at the boundary temperature ; for diffusely specular walls , the fourier boundary conditions are shown to be the neumann no - flux boundary condition .",
    "although these results have been _ empirically _ established centuries ago , this is the first time they are shown to arise , rigorously , from a solution of the boltzmann equation .",
    "more importantly , by extending the asymptotic expansion to first and second order in @xmath1 , we derive the governing `` continuum - level '' equation _ and boundary conditions _ for finite but small values of the knudsen number ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "specifically , for steady problems , the governing equation is shown to be the steady heat conduction equation up to order @xmath6 , while the corresponding boundary conditions are shown to be of the temperature - jump type , with jump coefficients that , in general , depend on the material and boundary properties . for unsteady problems ,",
    "we show that the governing equation is the unsteady heat conduction equation up to first order in @xmath1 with boundary conditions remaining the same as in the steady case up to that order for the case of prescribed - temperature boundaries .",
    "jump boundary conditions have been observed before in solutions of the boltzmann equation @xcite and attempts were made @xcite to explain these invoking differences in local equilibrium conditions across interfaces .",
    "the present work shows how temperature jumps arise as a result of the incompatibility between the isotropic distributions associated with boundary conditions and the anisotropic distribution associated with non - equilibrium resulting from transport ( temperature gradients ) .",
    "a well - known manifestation of this physical behavior are the temperature jumps associated with the kapitza interface problem . in section [ kapitza ] we show how our asymptotic approach can be used to calculate the interface conductance ( and associated temperature jump ) from first principles ( at the kinetic level , that is , given the interface transmission and reflection coefficient ) .",
    "the temperature jump relations derived in this work are manifestations of what is known in the kinetic theory community as `` slip '' , which gives its name to the slip regime , @xmath7 .",
    "it is generally known @xcite that in this regime the material constitutive law may still be used _",
    "unmodified _ and kinetic effects are accounted for by modified boundary conditions . in the field of rarefied gas dynamics , cercignani @xcite and sone with co - workers @xcite were the first to provide systematic asymptotic solutions up to second order in @xmath1 , demonstrating the possibility of using the traditional `` continuum '' fluid dynamics , albeit with modified boundary conditions , beyond the slip regime and into the early transition regime .",
    "the transition regime is typically defined by @xmath8 and represents the regime in which transport transitions from diffusive ( @xmath0 ) to ballistic ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "discussions of the use of asymptotic solutions of the boltzmann equation in rarefied gas dynamics can be found in @xcite .",
    "the practical implications of the present work are twofold : first , solution of the heat equation is significantly easier ( analytically or numerically ) compared to the boltzmann equation , especially in the regime @xmath0 where the latter becomes stiff .",
    "in addition to ease of solution , centuries of investment in continumm formulations such as the heat equation , either in the form of education , mathematical solution techniques or numerical solution software , make this by far the preferred approach .",
    "this can be easily seen from the considerable efforts expended in developing approximate `` effective thermal conductivity '' concepts that enable the use of fourier s law in the transition regime .",
    "the present work provides _ rigorous _",
    "methods for obtaining solutions _ consistent with the boltzmann equation _ in the slip and early transition regime .",
    "studies in rarefied gas dynamics show that , depending on the problem and the amount of error that can be tolerated , slip / jump formulations could be used up to @xmath10 and sometimes beyond @xcite .",
    "second , by using the asymptotic solution as a control in deviational monte carlo schemes , one can overcome the stiffness associated with the @xmath0 regime .",
    "this happens because @xcite the asymptotic solution becomes increasingly more accurate as @xmath3 , thus requiring increasingly less computational resources to describe the deviation therefrom as this limit is approached .",
    "this yields computational methods that are able to efficiently simulate problems characterized by @xmath11 locally or globally , in contrast to traditional boltzmann solution methods .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section [ background ] we introduce the governing ( boltzmann ) equation and the notation used in this paper ; in section [ asymptotic_analysis ] , we present the asymptotic analysis leading to derivation of the governing equation in the bulk up to second order in the knudsen number . associated boundary conditions and boundary layer corrections up to first order in the knudsen number are derived in section [ order1bl ] . in section [ order2bl ]",
    "we present results obtained from extending the boundary layer analysis to second order in knudsen number . in section [ summary ]",
    "we summarize and discuss our results and provide example applications to one - dimensional and two - dimensional problems . in section [ time - dep ]",
    "we discuss the applicability of the asymptotic theory and its results ( governing equations , boundary conditions and corrective boundary layers ) to time - dependent problems . in section [ kapitza ] we show how the asymptotic theory can be used to calculate the kapitza conductance ( and temperature jump ) associated with the interface between two materials .",
    "we conclude with some final remarks in section [ final ] .",

    "what follows , we use a single integral symbol to denote both integrals over multiple variables and sum over polarization .    in this study",
    ", relaxation times and group velocities may depend on frequency and polarization .",
    "for this reason , the knudsen number is defined in an average sense .",
    "we choose the following ( somewhat arbitrary ) definition @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 , which we will denote by kn . in the expression for @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the magnitude of the group velocity",
    "introducing the dimensionless coordinate @xmath42 as well as the normalization @xmath43 we write the boltzmann equation in the form @xmath44 where @xmath45    the usual macroscopic quantities of interest such as temperature , energy density and heat flux can be calculated from @xmath46 we will refer to @xmath47 as the deviational temperature , since it represents the deviation from the equilibrium temperature @xmath24 .",
    "the asymptotic solution relies on a `` hilbert - type '' @xcite expansion of the solution @xmath48 in the form @xmath49 given the nature of the proposed solution , similar expansions can be written for the temperature and the heat flux fields @xmath50    in this section , we only consider solutions far from any boundary . as will be shown below , close to the boundary , kinetic effects become important due to the incompatibility of the bulk solution with the kinetic ( boltzmann ) boundary condition and a separate , boundary layer analysis is required . therefore , we let @xmath51 be the bulk solution , anticipating that @xmath52 , where @xmath53 represents kinetic boundary layer corrections that are zero in the bulk and will be similarly expanded later .",

    "this is further discussed and quantified in section [ bl_results ] .    from equation ( [ phig0 ] ) we deduce that @xmath59 is a function that depends on @xmath62 only , since this is the case for @xmath63 .",
    "we note here that any function that only depends on @xmath62 is a solution .",
    "additionally , since @xmath64 , we find that the zeroth order deviational bulk temperature is given by @xmath65 and that @xmath66    at this stage , the spatial dependence of @xmath59 is undetermined .",
    "the additional information needed will be inferred from the application of a solvability condition to @xmath67 .",
    "using we find the following expression for the order 1 solution @xmath68 this equation states that a necessary condition for @xmath67 to be the order 1 solution is that it is equal to the sum of @xmath69 and a function that only depends on @xmath62 . since the temperature associated with @xmath70 is zero , we can write @xmath71    finally , order 2 may be derived following the same procedure for eq ( [ eq : bulk_relationship ] ) for @xmath72 , which yields @xmath73 in the following section , while deriving the governing equation for @xmath74 , we also show that the temperature associated with @xmath75 is @xmath76 .      the solvability condition required to determine @xmath77 is",

    "this implies @xmath82 this concludes the proof that the 0-th order temperature field obeys the steady state heat equation .",
    "moreover , from it follows that @xmath83 in appendix [ laplace_demo ] we show that higher - order ( in fact , possibly all order ) terms similarly obey the heat equation .",
    "in other words , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , are determined by solution of @xmath86    before we close this section , we note that although in the laplace - type equations derived above for the temperature the thermal conductivity does not appear , the above asymptotic analysis still clearly predicts that _ in the bulk , the material constitutive relation ( thermal conductivity ) is equal to the `` traditional '' bulk value_. this can be seen from first - principles by inserting into to obtain @xmath87 where the second equality follows from recognizing the well known expression @xmath88",
    "in this section , we extend the asymptotic analysis of the previous section to the vicinity of boundaries , where as will be shown below , a boundary layer analysis is required for matching the bulk solution of the previous section to the kinetic ( bte ) boundary conditions of interest . here",
    "we will consider two kinetic boundary conditions , namely , those of prescribed temperature and diffuse adiabatic reflection . in this work",
    "we assume that boundaries are flat ; boundary curvature will be considered in a future publication . without loss of generality",
    "we assume that the boundary is located at @xmath89 and with an inward normal pointing in the positive @xmath90 direction ; @xmath91 and @xmath92 will denote cartesian coordinates in the plane of the boundary .",

    "we now derive the general equation governing the boundary layer correction required in the boundary vicinity for matching the bulk solution to the kinetic ( bte ) boundary conditions .",
    "we introduce the boundary layer function @xmath100 , written as a hilbert expansion ( @xmath101 ) with @xmath102 and insert it in the boltzmann equation , obtaining @xmath103    in the vicinity of the boundary , a new characteristic lengthscale , namely the distance from the boundary , becomes important .",
    "similarly to @xcite , we introduce a `` stretched '' variable defined by @xmath104 .",
    "equation can thus be written in the form @xmath105 by equating terms of the same order , we find that each boundary layer term is solution to a 1d ( in physical space ) boltzmann - type equation . for @xmath106 ,",

    "specifically , for each order @xmath110 : @xmath111 the case @xmath112 will be considered in the following section , where second - order boundary layer analysis is carried out .",
    "the term `` prescribed temperature boundary '' is typically used to describe a boundary approximating a black - body , absorbing incoming phonons and emitting phonons from an equilibrium ( isotropic ) distribution at a given temperature . in other words ,",
    "the boltzmann boundary condition associated with such a boundary at deviational temperature @xmath113 is a bose - einstein ( equilibrium ) distribution at the wall temperature , denoted here by @xmath114 . in the linearized case ,",
    "the incoming distribution of deviational particles is therefore @xmath115 or simply , in terms of quantity @xmath48 defined in , @xmath116 .",
    "we note that @xmath59 is isotropic and is thus able to match @xmath117 provided we set @xmath118 at the boundary .",
    "therefore , at order 0 , the solution to the boltzmann equation with prescribed temperature boundaries is given by the heat equation complemented by the traditional dirichlet boundary conditions and no boundary layer correction is required ( @xmath119 , which also implies that @xmath120 )",
    ".    this situation changes at order 1 .",
    "the order 1 distribution @xmath121 is not isotropic due to the gradient of @xmath74 . as a consequence",
    ", there is a mismatch between the order 1 solution and the boundary condition ( which has been satisfied by @xmath59 and is thus zero for all subsequent orders ) .",
    "this mismatch can be corrected by introducing a boundary layer term @xmath106 governed by equation ( [ eq : k1_boltz ] ) and subject to boundary condition @xmath122 , which translates into the following relation @xmath123    the term @xmath124 is known from the order 0 solution .",
    "the term @xmath125 is unknown and determined by the fact that there exists only one value for @xmath125 such that @xmath106 tends to 0 for @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "this determination proceeds by writing @xmath127 where each of @xmath128 is the solution to an equation of the form with the associated boundary condition : @xmath129 anticipating the values of @xmath130 to scale with @xmath131 in the above equations we have set @xmath132 .",

    "the boundary condition is of the jump type and the associated temperature jump is proportional to the derivative of the 0th order solution in the direction normal to the boundary .",
    "the amplitude of the corrective boundary layer that is added near the wall is also proportional to the normal derivative : @xmath155 note that although a non - zero temperature field is associated with @xmath134 , the corresponding heat flux is zero .",
    "this is explained by the fact that @xmath134 , by construction , tends to 0 at infinity .",
    "since the boundary layer problem is one - dimensional in space , by energy conservation , the heat flux has to be constant in @xmath90 and is therefore zero everywhere .",
    "we also note that although @xmath135 and @xmath136 do not contribute to the temperature field , they do contribute in the heat flux @xmath156 in the direction parallel to the boundary .",
    "their contribution can be obtained by substituting into ; the result is summarized in section [ summary ] .      in section [ boundary_conditions ]",
    "we reported the value of the coefficient @xmath157 and boundary - layer function @xmath134 in the single free path case . in this section",
    "we report results for two more realistic material models .",
    "specifically , we consider a material with realistic dispersion relation and a single relaxation time , as well as a material with realistic dispersion relation and frequency - dependent relaxation times .",
    "the dispersion relation in both cases is taken to be that of the [ 100 ] direction in silicon .",
    "the single relaxation time is taken to be 40ps . in the case of a variable relaxation time we use a slightly modified born - von karman - slack ( mbvks ) model @xcite with parameters from @xcite and @xcite , where the grain size used for boundary scattering is 0.27 mm instead of 2.7 mm .",
    "the reason for this approximation is that it facilitates the verification of the order 1 behavior with monte carlo simulation .",
    "we do not consider optical phonons in this work , but the method can be straightforwardly extended to this case .",
    "we find @xmath158 in the single relaxation time model and @xmath159 in the mbvks model .",
    "the associated boundary layers are plotted in figure [ fig : order1_smfp ] .",
    "it is important to note that :    * the values of coefficient @xmath157 and the function @xmath160 depends on the definition of @xmath1 or , equivalently , @xmath161 , which is rather arbitrary .",
    "this , however , does not influence the final result because the asymptotic temperature field , ultimately ( see ( [ t_expansion ] ) ) depends on the products @xmath162 and @xmath163 ( see for instance solution ) .",
    "* the boundary layer in the mbvks model is particularly wide ( on the order of millimeters ) .",
    "this observation , as well as the large value of @xmath157 , is a manifestation of the stiffness ( multiscale nature ) of this problem , resulting from the wide range of free paths present in this material ; mathematically , it is due to the factor @xmath164 that appears in and which tends to give more weight to modes with very large free paths and makes the assumption @xmath56 hard to satisfy .",

    "it is important to note , however , that this limitation is a result of the fundamental physics of the problem : even at `` low '' knudsen numbers given by @xmath168 , there exist modes with long free paths ( i.e. @xmath169 ) introducing kinetic effects and making the zeroth order solution ( @xmath170 ) inadequate .",

    "these effective boundary conditions are derived for a variety of kinetic boundary conditions and shown to generally be of the jump type thus explaining the temperature jumps at the boundaries previously observed and remarked upon @xcite .",
    "we note here that the jump conditions are universal ( non - adjustable ) , while the jump coefficients and kinetic boundary layers are universal for a given material and material - interface interaction model ; in other words , they are independent of system dimensionality and once calculated they can be used in any geometry of interest .",
    "tabulated data for the various boundary layers derived not available in analytical form are available upon request .",
    "these results provide no evidence or justification for modifying the material constitutive relation ( thermal conductivity ) as a means of extending the applicability of the traditional continuum description to the transition regime  the underlying physics is considerably more complex . according to the asymptotic theory presented here , in the regime @xmath411 ( strictly speaking @xmath412 ) solutions consistent with the boltzmann equation",
    "are obtained using a thermal conductivity that is equal to the bulk value ; the modified ( typically reduced ) transport rate associated with size effects _ due to boundary presence _ is captured by the additional resistance introduced by the jump boundary conditions as well as kinetic corrections that are to be linearly superposed to the final heat conduction result .",
    "on the other hand , by virtue of the expansion considered here , this work pertains to breakdown and extension of the classical fourier description due to the inhomogeneity introduced by boundaries . as a result",
    ", it does not treat kinetic effects appearing in a spatially homogeneous material such as those arising from temporal variations that are fast compared to the relaxation time , or spatial variations that have characteristic lengthscales that are on the order of , or smaller than , the phonon mean free path , that are also of interest to the scientific community @xcite .",
    "ultimately , a theory that captures both classes of kinetic effects under a unified framework needs to be developed ; we hope that this work is a step towards that goal .",
    "our results are extensively validated using deviational monte carlo simulations of multidimensional problems .",
    "studies in rarefied gas dynamics @xcite show that second - order asymptotic formulations are reliable to engineering accuracy up to @xmath413 and in some cases , depending on the problem simplicity , beyond .",
    "our numerical validations support this finding .",
    "we note that the theory presented here assumes boundaries to be flat ( no curvature ) .",
    "curvature effects are expected to introduce additional terms in the effective boundary condition expressions and associated boundary layer corrections @xcite",
    ". this will be the subject of future work .",
    "due to its ability to capture the inhomogeneity in the distribution function associated with presence of boundaries , the present theory lends itself naturally to the description of the kapitza resistance _ and temperature jump _ associated with the interface between two materials .",
    "we have shown that the asymptotic description produces results that are in excellent agreement with deviational monte carlo simulations .",
    "in other words , given transmission and reflection coefficients at the interface , the asymptotic theory may be used to _ predict _ the kapitza resistance without any assumption on the form of the distribution in the interface vicinity .",
    "in this section , we show that @xmath177 and @xmath274 are solution to the laplace equation .",
    "we start with the case of @xmath177 .",
    "we apply the solvability condition to @xmath75 to obtain : @xmath414 integration over @xmath35 removes terms containing odd powers of @xmath415 , yielding @xmath416 from which we conclude that @xmath417    to obtain the laplace equation for @xmath274 , we apply to @xmath418 . after carrying out the angular integration and cancelling terms containing odd powers of @xmath415",
    "we are left with @xmath419 thus , in order to show that the laplace equation holds for @xmath274 , we need to show that @xmath420 performing the angular integration , we obtain @xmath421 as desired .",
    "it appears that this procedure can be applied to all higher order terms ( @xmath422 , @xmath423 , etc . ) .",
    "coefficients @xmath424 and @xmath425 ( in ) and functions @xmath426 and @xmath427 ( in ) are determined by boundary value problems of the same form as the ones discussed in section [ boundary_conditions ] satisfying equation .",
    "the problems that determine the coefficients @xmath428 include the source terms from that appear on the rhs of . in the interest of brevity , we only discuss the ones associated with the source term @xmath429 . the remaining two ( associated with the term @xmath430 ) may be deduced by analogy .    for @xmath137",
    "coefficient @xmath431 is solution to : @xmath432 where @xmath433 denotes the heaviside function .",
    "two results can be obtained immediately :    * coefficients @xmath434 , @xmath435 and @xmath436 are solutions to the same problems as @xmath157 , @xmath437 and @xmath438 . consequently , they are equal and their associated boundary layers are the same , provided @xmath439 is replaced by @xmath177 in eqs . , and . * coefficients @xmath425 and @xmath428 for @xmath440 are zero . for instance , it can be verified that @xmath441 is a solution of .",
    "solutions for all @xmath425 and @xmath442 can be systematically obtained by solving the associated problem without the @xmath443 term and then verifying that @xmath444    we are left with five undetermined coefficients , namely @xmath445 , @xmath446 , @xmath447 , @xmath448 and @xmath449 .",
    "these can be determined using the numerical approach described in @xcite ( suitably modified in order to accommodate the volumetric source terms which appear in the mathematical formulation ) . instead of following this approach , here we prove that @xmath450 and that , therefore , the temperature jump associated with the second order derivative is zero , while the boundary layer , although not zero , integrates into a zero temperature .",
    "the remaining five coefficients in relation , can be determined by finding the function @xmath451 that satifies : @xmath452 let @xmath453 , where @xmath454 for @xmath455 correspond , respectively , to the five boundary layer functions that are the counterparts of the five temperature jump terms in relation .",
    "we proceed with a strategy similar to the one used above , namely , solve for each @xmath454 individually , ignoring the contribution of @xmath456 , and then evaluating @xmath456 . in the present case @xmath457 but @xmath458 ; more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "this proves that @xmath459 is the solution of with the specified source terms and boundary conditions , and that the resulting boundary layer satisfies the boundary conditions without requiring a temperature jump correction , that is , relation is proved .",
