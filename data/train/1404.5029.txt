    "estimation is a major component in the energy management system ( ems ) of electrical power grids .",
    "the state estimator receives the raw meter measurements fed by the scada ( supervisory control and data acquisition ) system , filters the incorrect data and derives the optimal estimate of the power system operating states @xcite .",
    "the state estimates will then be passed on to the other ems application functions such as the contingency analysis and optimal power flow , to control and optimize the system performance .",
    "accurate state estimation is critical to maintain the system to operate in a secure and efficient state .",
    "however , the integrity of state estimation is under mounting threat as we gradually transform the current electricity infrastructures to future smart power grids .",
    "the system is more open to the outside networks from the extensive use of internet - based protocols in the communication system . in particular , enterprise networks and",
    "even individual users are allowed to connect to the power network information infrastructure to facilitate data sharing @xcite . with these entry points introduced to the power system , potential complex and collaborating malicious attacks",
    "are brought in as well .",
    "et al_.@xcite showed that a false - data injection attack that alters a subset of selected meter measurements could circumvent bad data detection ( bdd ) in today s scada system and introduce arbitrary errors to state estimates without being detected .",
    "essentially , the altered meter measurements are structured to be consistent with the physical power flow constraints .",
    "such an attack is referred to as an _ undetectable _ false - data injection attack and has attracted increasing research interest in the power system cyber - security @xcite .",
    "a recent experiment in @xcite demonstrates that the attack can cause a state - of - the - art ems / scada state estimator to produce a bias of more than @xmath0 of the nominal value without triggering the bdd alarm .",
    "biased estimates could directly lead to serious social and economical consequences .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that attackers equipped with data injection can manipulate the electricity price in power market .",
    "worse still , @xcite warned that the attack can even cause regional blackout .",
    "the conventional wisdom to mitigate false - data injection attack is by securing meter measurements to evade malicious injections , e.g. either by guards , video monitoring or tamper - proof communication system , etc @xcite .",
    "for instance , @xcite quantifies the vulnerability of meter measurements in the presence of injection attack using  security indices \" .",
    "@xcite computes the critical points in the measurement set , the compromise of which would result in successful undetectable attack . @xcite",
    "proposed to use phasor measurement units ( pmus ) , which provide direct voltage phasor angle measurements at the buses installed , to mitigate sparse undetectable attack . in particular , @xcite proved that it is necessary and sufficient to protect a set of _ basic measurements _ so that no undetectable false - data injection attack can be launched , where the size of a set of basic measurements is the same as the number of unknown state variables in the state estimation problem . with a limited budget but the vast size of large - scale power networks , it is often not possible to completely eliminate the chance of undetectable attack . in practice , the system operator should first protect the state variables that have greater social / economic impact once compromised , such as those for critical buses / substations connected to heavily loaded or economically important areas , or with critical interconnection purposes @xcite .",
    "our preliminary study in @xcite has partly addressed this issue , where a sequential method is proposed to find a minimum set of meter measurements for the protection of any set of state variables . however , the enumeration - based method is of very high computational complexity in large scale power systems .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to devise an efficient method to protect a subset of state variables that serves our best interests , and opens to the possibility of expanding the set of protected state variables in the future .",
    "another newly emerged approach against injection attack is to limit the attacker s knowledge of the topological information needed for performing attacks @xcite . in practice",
    ", this incurs lower operation cost as it merely needs to change the parameters of some software / hardware configurations , such as the adjustable transformer taps in transmission lines , or the flexible a.c .",
    "transmission systems ( facts ) to adjust the real - time effective reactance , etc @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the intentional topology perturbation enables the system operator to detect the presence of false - data injection using conventional residual test . however",
    ", a random topology perturbation does not fully eliminate the possibility of undetectable attack .",
    "for instance , @xcite showed that undetectable attack is still possible if the attacker has imperfect but structured topological information .",
    "currently , it lacks of a systematic study that provides an explicit guideline for the system operator to efficiently utilize the _ covert topological information _ against injection attacks .",
    "in this paper , we focus on using covert topological information ( cti ) to mitigate false - data injection attacks . by keeping the exact reactance of a minimum set of transmission lines from attackers",
    ", no undetectable injection attack can be formulated to compromise any set of state variables . besides",
    ", we also propose a _ mixed defending strategy _ that jointly considers cti and conventional secure meter measurement methods .",
    "our detailed contributions are listed as follows ,    * we derive from the attackers perspective a necessary and sufficient condition to perform undetectable attack with partial topological information .",
    "in particular , we develop a _ min - cut _ method to design the optimal attack , which requires the minimum knowledge of system topology .",
    "the result is useful to develop effective countermeasures against undetectable attack .",
    "* we show that the solution to the optimal state variable protection , which defends a set of critical state variables with minimum cti , can be obtained by solving a standard _ steiner tree problem_. although the problem is _ np - hard _ , many well - investigated exact and approximation algorithms can be directly applied .",
    "* we also develop a mixed defending strategy that jointly considers the use of cti and secure meter measurements when either method alone is costly or unable to achieve the protection objective .",
    "a mixed integer linear programming ( milp ) formulation is introduced to obtain the optimal mixed defending strategy . to tackle the _ np - hardness _ of the problem , a tree pruning - based heuristic is further presented to produce an approximate solution in polynomial time .",
    "state estimation protection is closely related to the concept of _ power network observability_. the conventional power network observability analysis studies whether a unique estimate of all unknown state variables can be determined from the measurements @xcite . from the attacker s perspective",
    ", @xcite proved that an undetectable attack can be formulated if removing the measurements it compromises will make the power system unobservable .",
    "conversely , @xcite showed that no undetectable attack can be formulated if the power system is observable from the protected meter measurements .",
    "the early work by krumpholz _",
    "et al_. @xcite stated that a power system is observable if and only if it contains a spanning tree , which we refer to as an edged - measured spanning tree , that satisfies certain measurement - to - transmission - line mapping rules .",
    "few recent papers also applied graphical methods to study the attack / defending mechanisms of false - data injection .",
    "for instance , based on the results in @xcite , @xcite proposed an algorithm to quantify the minimum - effort undetectable attack , i.e. the non - trivial attack that compromises least number of meters without being detected .",
    "besides , @xcite used a min - cut relaxation method to calculate the security indices defined in @xcite to quantify the resistance of meter measurements in the presence of injection attack .",
    "similar min - cut approach was also applied in @xcite to identify the critical points in the measurement set , the loss of which would render the power system unobservable .    in this paper , we also study the state estimation protection problem from a graphical perspective .",
    "the novelties of the proposed methods are in twofold .",
    "first , in addition to the conventional method of securing meter measurement , we introduce a _ new degree of freedom _ of using cti for system protection and derives explicit protection procedures .",
    "second , we consider a more general problem of protecting any subset of state variables with minimum cost .",
    "the graphical method of using only cti for state variable protection is proved to be equivalent to a well - studied steiner tree problem .",
    "a more challenging problem is the mixed defending strategy that jointly considers the cti and secure meter measurement protection .",
    "we formulate the problem into a variant steiner arborescence problem and propose both exact and approximation graphical algorithms .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce some preliminaries about state estimation and false - data injection attack .",
    "we study the design of partial knowledge attack in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we propose efficient defending mechanisms and discuss some application scenarios .",
    "the performance of the proposed defending mechanisms is evaluated in section v. finally , the paper is concluded in section vi . an early version of this paper with only cti protection was published in the @xmath1 ieee globecom @xcite .",
    "we consider the linearized power network state estimation problem in a steady - state power system with @xmath2 buses and @xmath3 transmission lines .",

    "another interesting application scenario is to include phasor measurement units ( pmus ) into the measurement set besides the power flow and injection measurements .",
    "combined with gps technology , pmus can provide direct real - time voltage phasor measurement , i.e. voltage amplitude and phase angle , with high precision and short measurement periodic time @xcite .",
    "interestingly , our method can be easily extended to incorporate pmus in the measurement set .",
    "note that the state variable of a tagged bus can not be compromised by attacks if a secure pmu is installed at the bus .",
    "this is equivalent to installing a secure flow meter between the tagged bus and the reference bus .",
    "if there is a collide with existing flow meter , we merely change the cost of protecting the meter by the minimum cost between the existing flow meter and the pmu . on the other hand ,",
    "if there exists no such power line connecting the two buses , a pseudo transmission line can be added to facilitate the calculation of the masa problem .",
    "an illustrative example is given in fig .",
    "@xmath284 , where a graph is extracted from a @xmath285-bus power network .",
    "bus @xmath16 is the reference bus and pmus are available at bus @xmath16 and @xmath13 .",
    "the solid edges are the actual transmission lines in the power network .",
    "the dashed edge connecting bus @xmath16 and @xmath13 is made up by the pmu at bus @xmath13 , where a pseudo - flow meter of random direction is placed on edge @xmath286}$ ] .",
    "since now we have formulated an equivalent problem with conventional power flows / injections measurements , the proposed arborescence construction algorithms can be directly applied .",
    "the only modification needed is that injection meters can not be mapped to a dashed edge in the steiner tree solution , because they do not measure the dashed edges in real system .",
    "the detailed modifications are omitted here to avoid the repetition of presentations . in the example in fig .",
    "@xmath284 , an arc - measured arborescence can be constructed by edges @xmath287},e_{[5,7]}\\right\\}$ ] , which are mapped to the pseudo - flow meter on edge @xmath286}$ ] ( from the pmu at bus @xmath13 ) and the flow meter on edge @xmath288}$ ] , respectively .",
    "then , state variable of bus @xmath285 can be defended if the pmu at bus @xmath13 and the flow meter on @xmath288}$ ] are protected .        before leaving this session ,",
    "we want to specify the best use of the proposed algorithms .",
    "when protecting all the state variables , the state estimation protection problem in @xcite is a special case of ours .",
    "the proposed tph algorithm indeed uses the same gauss - jordan elimination technique proposed in @xcite . for the proposed milp formulation ,",
    "however , the complexity could be much higher due to the np - harness of solving integer programming problems .",
    "therefore , we do not recommend to using milp to solve the special case that all the state variables are to be protected .",
    "another point to mention is the impact of the redundancy in measurements . on one hand , the complexity of the milp increases with the measurement redundancy , as the number of variables @xmath236 in the optimization problem ( [ 27 ] ) will increase . on the other hand , the proposed tph is not sensitive to measurement redundancy , i.e. its complexity is @xmath289 , independent of the number of measurements .",
    ".statistics of different power system testcases [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      we then evaluate the performance of the proposed tph algorithm in both complexity and solution quality .",
    "the @xmath116-bus , @xmath290-bus and @xmath291-bus systems are considered and milp is the benchmark for comparison . in each system , we assume that @xmath292 of the transmission lines can be chosen as the candidate covert transmission lines for protection .",
    "for instance , we consider @xmath293 out of @xmath294 transmission lines as @xmath95 in the @xmath290-bus system .",
    "the cost of protecting each transmission line is @xmath295 , while @xmath16 for securing a meter measurement . for tph , we set the parameter @xmath296 and record the total number of vertices that are checked to produce a solution . for milp , we record the number of simplex iterations performed by the branch - and - cut algorithm .",
    "besides , we also record the cpu time for both methods .    fig .",
    "@xmath297 compares the computational complexity between milp and tph algorithms .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "@xmath297 are the average performance of @xmath298 independent experiments . without loss of generality",
    ", we randomly generate a @xmath100 with size @xmath299 in each experiment . in fig .",
    "@xmath297a , we show the average number of iterations in log - scale for @xmath116-bus , @xmath290-bus and @xmath291-bus systems , respectively .",
    "the exact iteration numbers are also marked in the figure .",
    "we find that the iteration numbers are close for both methods in the @xmath116-bus system , where tph consumes @xmath300 iterations and the milp consumes @xmath301 iterations to obtain a solution .",
    "however , the difference becomes more and more significant as the network size increases .",
    "the number of iterations of tph increases by @xmath275 times as the network size increases from @xmath116 to @xmath291 buses .",
    "in vivid contrast , the iteration number of milp increases rapidly by @xmath302 times , from merely @xmath301 to @xmath303 .",
    "similar results are also observed for the cpu time , where tph takes only @xmath304 second to obtain a solution in @xmath291-bus system , while milp consumes more than a minute , which is @xmath305 times slower than in the @xmath116-bus system .",
    "it is foreseeable that the computational complexity of the milp method will become extremely expensive as we further increase the network size .",
    "for instance , the projected cpu time of milp to solve a problem in @xmath306-bus system is around @xmath115 days , while it takes tph less than @xmath115 seconds .",
    "we also investigate the impact of the parameter @xmath259 to the performance of tph . by varying the values of @xmath259 and @xmath307",
    ", we plot the ratio @xmath308 for some selected @xmath307 s in fig .",
    "@xmath309 , where @xmath310 is the cost of the solution obtained by tph and @xmath311 is the minimum cost obtained from milp .",
    "we notice that the ratio improves notably for small @xmath307 as @xmath259 increases from @xmath16 to @xmath312 .",
    "for instance , the ratio improves from @xmath313 to @xmath314 for @xmath186 .",
    "the improvement is especially notable when we change @xmath296 to @xmath120 .",
    "however , the improvement becomes marginal as we further increase @xmath259 , such as the case with @xmath315 , where the ratio only improves by @xmath316 from @xmath296 to @xmath312 .",
    "we also plot in fig .",
    "@xmath317 the cpu time normalized against the time consumed when @xmath296 .",
    "we observe that the cpu time increases almost linearly with @xmath259 , which matches our analysis in section iv .",
    "results in fig .",
    "@xmath318 indicate that we should select a proper @xmath259 to achieve a balance between the solution quality and computational complexity .",
    "in particular , a large @xmath259 , such as @xmath319 , should be used when @xmath307 is small relative to @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath320 .",
    "otherwise , a small @xmath259 , such as @xmath321 , should be used when @xmath307 is relatively large .         to the performance of tph in the @xmath290-bus system .",
    "( a ) the figure above shows the cost of solution using tph normalized by the optimal cost obtained by milp ; ( b ) the figure below shows the cpu time of tph normalized by the cpu time when @xmath296.,width=307 ]",
    "in this paper , we investigated the defending mechanisms against false - data injection attack using covert topological information ( cti ) .",
    "we studied from both the attackers and the system operator s perspective and characterized the optimal protection as a well - studied steiner tree problem in a graph .",
    "we also proposed a mixed defending strategy that bridges the gap between cti protection and the conventional wisdom of secure meter measurement protection method . both exact solution and reduced complexity approximate algorithms are proposed .",
