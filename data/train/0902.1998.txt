    "the ads / cft correspondence  @xcite provides a remarkable mathematical tool with which to understand strongly - coupled gauge theories . by using an effective dictionary that relates strongly - coupled gauge theories to higher - dimensional gravitational theories , calculations performed on the gravity side can be reinterpreted as due to nonperturbative effects on the field theory side .",
    "this allows for previously incalculable quantities to be calculated using the gravitational dual .",
    "the theory of the strong interactions , or quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , is a strongly - coupled gauge theory at low energies , and therefore a natural candidate with which to apply the gauge / gravity correspondence .",
    "this had led to a bottom - up approach , commonly known as ads / qcd  @xcite , which relates qcd to a five - dimensional ( 5d ) gravity theory .",
    "this model is simple and predictive , capturing the essential features of the low - lying meson spectrum .    in an attempt to incorporate more realistic features of the excited states such as the linear regge behavior of qcd",
    ", the ads / qcd model can be modified to include a dilaton with a quadratic profile  @xcite .",
    "while the linear radial spectrum is indeed produced in this soft - wall version of the ads / qcd model , the form of chiral symmetry breaking is not qcd - like . in particular , the bulk scalar field , dual to the quark bilinear operator @xmath2 , whose vacuum expectation value ( vev ) is responsible for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , does not allow the spontaneous and explicit breaking to be independent .",
    "moreover , chiral symmetry is restored for the highly excited states , a phenomenological feature that is not supported in the qcd mass spectrum  @xcite .    in this paper , we modify the existing soft - wall version of the ads / qcd model in order to incorporate these two phenomenological features of qcd .",
    "this is done by adding a quartic term to the bulk scalar potential and changing the dilaton profile . by assuming that the bulk scalar field",
    "contains the desired limiting behavior for non restoration of chiral symmetry @xcite , we derive a new dilaton background profile .",
    "the extra parameter introduced by the quartic term decouples the quark mass from the chiral condensate , thereby allowing for spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking to occur independently .",
    "the dilaton profile resulting from the required form of the bulk scalar field vev conforms to the expected behavior required to obtain linear trajectories at large conformal coordinate @xmath3 .",
    "the small @xmath3 behavior of the dilaton modifies the potential , thus affecting the mesons in the extra dimension and producing different mass spectra for the mesons under consideration .    of course , constructing an ads dual theory that encompasses the richness of qcd presents the greatest challenge , a task yet to be accomplished .",
    "in fact certain qcd - like characteristics such as event shapes in high energy collisions are not reproduced in the simple 5d gravitational model   @xcite .",
    "instead genuine stringy dynamics seem to be required to capture the complete qcd behavior . nevertheless the remarkable fact that at large thooft coupling certain features of the hadron spectrum can be calculated by a relatively simple 5d model",
    "make the ads / qcd correspondence an important analytic tool that can further our understanding of qcd .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : we introduce the modified soft - wall model in section [ secdual ] and describe how the new dilaton profile and higher - order terms lead to a model describing spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "our fit to the qcd meson spectrum is made in section 3 where we analyze the scalar , vector , and axial - vector sectors of the model . in section 4",
    "we determine the pion decay constant , the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation , the coupling of the vector mesons to the pions , and the pion electromagnetic form factor .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section  5 .",
    "we will consider a modified version of the soft - wall ads / qcd model first introduced in @xcite and further investigated in @xcite .",
    "the background geometry is assumed to be 5d ads space with the metric @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the warp factor , @xmath6 is the ads curvature radius and the minkowski metric @xmath7 .",

    ", @xcite also introduced a background dilaton field , @xmath9 , with the asymptotic behavior @xmath10 where @xmath11 sets the mass scale for the meson spectrum .",
    "the varying dilaton field also ensures that conformal symmetry is gradually broken in this phenomenological dual theory .    to describe chiral symmetry breaking in the meson sector the 5d action contains su(2)@xmath12 su(2)@xmath13 gauge fields and a bifundamental scalar field @xmath14 . as suggested by @xcite , we add a quartic term in the potential @xmath15 of our 5d action , @xmath16,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is a constant and @xmath19 , with @xmath20 the number of colors .",

    "the scalar field , @xmath14 , which is dual to the operator @xmath28 , is assumed to obtain a @xmath3-dependent vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , @xmath29 which breaks the chiral symmetry su(2)@xmath12 su(2)@xmath30 su(2)@xmath31 . assuming ( [ xvev ] ) we obtain a nonlinear equation for the vev @xmath32 , @xmath33 when @xmath34 , the solution of ( [ vevequation ] ) which leads to a finite action in the limit @xmath35 is given by  @xcite @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the tricomi confluent hypergeometric function .",

    ", the introduction of @xmath44 still satisfies the gell - mann - oakes - renner relation , @xmath47 . expanding the solution ( [ equk0 ] ) in the small @xmath3 limit leads to @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus in the limit @xmath50 the model eliminates explicit and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in contradiction with qcd .",
    "it will be seen that the introduction of a quartic term in the potential @xmath15 avoids the dependence of the chiral condensate on the quark mass encountered in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the solution ( [ equk0 ] ) has an asymptotic limit @xmath51 constant for large values of @xmath3 .",
    "this asymptotic behavior suggests chiral symmetry restoration in the mass spectrum , a phenomenon not supported in qcd ( although speculation continues on whether such a restoration indeed exists @xcite ) . as noted in @xcite the highly excited mesons exhibit seemingly parallel slopes signifying that chiral symmetry is not restored . in order to incorporate this behavior",
    "the scalar vev @xmath32 must behave linearly as @xmath3 becomes large , @xmath52 causing the mass difference between vector and axial - vector resonances to approach a constant as @xmath35 . by including a quartic term and requiring @xmath32 to have this linear asymptotic behavior we aim to incorporate these qcd - like characteristics into the soft - wall model .",
    "the solution for the vev @xmath32 was derived from the dilaton form ( [ dilatonlz ] ) and , as we have seen , does not reproduce the phenomenological features expected in qcd . instead of solving for @xmath32 directly , we assume the vev asymptotically behaves as expected , namely @xmath53 and then solve for the dilaton @xmath54 using ( [ vevequation ] ) which becomes @xmath55,\\ ] ] where the prime @xmath56 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath3 . given the required behavior ( [ smallv ] ) and ( [ largev ] ) we can uniquely determine the dilaton profile up to a constant . with this procedure",
    "the two sources of chiral symmetry breaking decouple while simultaneously allowing for linear trajectories in the meson spectrum .    a particularly simple parametrized form for @xmath32 that satisfies ( [ smallv ] ) and ( [ largev ] ) is @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 are all positive coefficients dependent upon @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath61 , and @xmath18 , as plotted in figure [ vevfig ] .",
    "expanding ( [ arcv ] ) at small and large @xmath3 leads to the desired asymptotic forms @xmath62 when @xmath63 , corresponding to a zero quark mass , the coefficients of the cubic term in ( [ arcvsmall ] ) and of the linear term in ( [ arcvlarge ] ) are nonzero , implying a nonzero chiral condensate and non restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "alternatively , when @xmath64 ( or @xmath65 ) , corresponding to a zero chiral condensate , the coefficients of the linear terms in ( [ arcvsmall ] ) and ( [ arcvlarge ] ) are both nonzero , implying a nonzero quark mass and non restoration of chiral symmetry .",
    "thus the parametrized form in ( [ arcv ] ) allows the sources of spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking to remain independent .    substituting ( [ arcv ] ) into ( [ phieqn ] )",
    "leads to the following asymptotic behavior @xmath66 where we have chosen the integration constant arising from ( [ phieqn ] ) to be zero in order for the background to be conformally invariant at @xmath67 . to reproduce the limits ( [ arcvsmall ] ) and ( [ arcvlarge ] ) the dilaton profile at small @xmath3 ( [ arcphi0 ] ) must differ from that at large @xmath3 ( [ arcphiinf ] ) .",
    "importantly this does not sacrifice the linear trajectories which ( as will be shown ) depend on the dilaton having the asymptotic form ( [ dilatonlz ] ) .",
    "note that the quartic term with strength @xmath18 is necessary to obtain the required behavior .",

    "the parameter @xmath18 essentially controls the mass splitting between the vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "it is determined to be @xmath79 by a best fit to the radial spectra of the axial - vector mesons , also shown in the next section .",

    "<S> we show how to incorporate chiral symmetry breaking in the soft - wall version of the ads / qcd model by using a modified dilaton profile and a quartic term in the bulk scalar potential . </S>",
    "<S> this allows one to separate the dependence on spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking . </S>",
    "<S> moreover our 5d model automatically incorporates linear trajectories and non chiral - symmetry restoration for highly excited radial states . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our resulting mass spectra in the scalar , vector and axial - vector sectors with the respective qcd resonances and find reasonable agreement using the known values for the pion mass and decay constant .    * chiral symmetry breaking + in soft - wall ads / qcd *    tony gherghetta,@xmath0 joseph i. kapusta@xmath1 and thomas m. kelley@xmath1 +   + _ _ + </S>"
