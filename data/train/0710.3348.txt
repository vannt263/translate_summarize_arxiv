    "it is in principle possible to even obtain analytic results from the mellin  barnes representation @xcite .",
    "however , the way of hypergeometric functions turned out to be more appropriate for the calculation of analytic results . in this case , one first introduces feynman parameters and does the two momentum integrations . as an example , the scalar version of diagram @xmath31 of figure [ fig : examples ] with all propagators to the power one , evaluates to :    i_e:&= + & _ 0 ^ 1dzdw  .    on rewriting this feynman parameter integral into a @xmath32function , one obtains a product of @xmath33functions and the euler beta ",

    "these sums could be solved among other things using their integral representations , where a certain amount of more complicated sums could be calculated using the mathematica package sigma @xcite . for integral @xmath31",

    "the above mellin - space expressions can be converted to @xmath3-space using analytic continuation in @xmath11 and mellin inversion @xcite .",
    "the results in @xcite , which are up to constant order in @xmath0 , involved 48 basic functions , cf .",
    "@xcite . our results for the constant part of the omes gave raise to only six harmonic sums , where five of them can be obtained from @xmath43 through differentiation after analytic continuation and using algebraic relations .",
    "this leads to an amount of only two basic functions @xcite . to order o(@xmath0 ) , we encounter the following 14 harmonic sums : @xmath44 @xmath45 we can again group the first seven functions into the same class . additionally , one finds that the function @xmath46 depends on @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and the harmonic sum @xmath49 depends on @xmath50 , which leaves us to order @xmath0 with only six basic harmonic sums , as also observed for a large variety of other two  loop processes , cf .",
