    "@xcite , this quantum structure of space - time , where the space - time coordinates are operator - valued and satisfy a non - commuting coordinate algebra , can be one of the most plausible ways to prevent the gravitational collapse arising from the attempt to localise a space - time event within a planck length scale . since making a guess regarding the non - commutative structure of the coordinate algebra",
    "is difficult , one tries to postulate a simple structure of this form and study the geometry of the resulting non - commutative spaces .",
    "the simplest examples are the 2d moyal plane ( @xmath4 ) :    @xmath5 = i \\theta , \\label{mp}\\ ] ]    and fuzzy @xmath6 :    @xmath7 = i \\lambda \\epsilon_{ijk } \\hat{x}_k .",
    "\\label{fs}\\ ] ]    fuzzy sphere @xmath8 corresponds to a 2d subspace of @xmath6 with radius quantized as @xmath9 @xcite . because of the inherent uncertainty relations satisfied by these coordinates the usual concepts like points , lines etc loose their meaning in these kinds of spaces .",
    "it thus becomes essential to use the mathematical formalism of non - commutative geometry(ncg ) as developed by connes @xcite to study the geometry of such spaces .",
    "+ we would like to mention in this context that connes himself , along with his other collaborators , have invested a lot of effort in formulating a completely new mathematical framework to describe the standard model of particle physics , by invoking the so - called  almost commutative spaces \" - built out of the usual commutative ( euclideanised ) 4d curved space - time .",
    "this is expected to describe physics upto gut scale ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) . however , as we mentioned in the beginning , one perhaps has to take quantum space - times , i.e. spaces where the coordinates become operators satisfying a non - commutative algebra and for which ( [ mp ] ) and ( [ fs ] ) provide prototype examples , more seriously in the higher energy scales - like in the vicinity of planck scales .",
    "( see for example @xcite for a review ) .",
    "it is only recently that the above mentioned mathematical framework of ncg , _ a la _ connes , has been used to compute the spectral distances on  quantized spaces \" like the moyal plane , fuzzy sphere etc . @xcite,@xcite-@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "an algorithm was devised in @xcite to compute this distance using the hilbert - schmidt operatorial formulation of quantum mechanics @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this hilbert - schmidt operatorial formulation has the advantage that it bypasses the use of any star product , like moyal or voros , and is therefore free from any ambiguities that can arise from there @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it has an additional advantage that the above - mentioned algorithm / formula is adaptable to this hilbert - schmidt operatorial formulation and infinitesimally it has essentially the same structure as that of the induced metric from the hilbert space inner product , obtained by provost and vallee @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , when expressed in terms of the density matrix @xcite and yields for the moyal plane the correct distance in the  harmonic oscillator basis \" and the flat metric in the coherent state , upto an overall numerical factor .",
    "however , the corresponding finite distance can not simply be obtained just by  integrating \" along the geodesics , as the very concept of geodesics in the conventional sense ( i.e. like on a commutative differentiable manifold ) may not exist at all . this motivates us to undertake the task of extending our algorithm of @xcite so that one is able to compute finite distances as well .",
    "this new formula is shown to involve the ` transverse ' component ( @xmath12 ) , in addition to the  longitudinal \" component ( @xmath13 ) where @xmath14 is the difference between normal states represented by density matrices , as in @xcite .",
    "this in turn shows that the formula of @xcite actually corresponds only to the lower bound of the distance and not the actual distance .",
    "indeed , on the way to our derivation of the generalised formula in section [ sec5 ] we point out a flaw , commented on in @xcite through a counter example , in the analysis in @xcite where the same expression was shown to correspond to the upper bound as well .",
    "it should , however , be mentioned that the counter example in @xcite does not satisfy the boundedness condition imposed in @xcite .",
    "this error was not serious in examples studied previously to compute infinitesimal distances as these distances coincided with the exact distance for discrete states and differed from the exact distance by a numerical factor for the coherent states for both @xmath4 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "however , as one can easily see , a straightforward calculation to compute _ finite _ distances , using the same formula does not yield any sensible result indicating a non - trivial role for the transverse component @xmath12 . in the generic case",
    "there can be many choices of @xmath12 to a given @xmath14 ( in fact an infinite number of them in @xmath4 ) .",
    "consequently the computation of the infimum involving @xmath12 occurring in the revised formula turns out to be quite non - trivial .",
    "one therefore has to try with different forms of @xmath12 and improve the estimate of the distance as best as one can . + on the other hand , we can emulate and adapt the approach of @xcite to our hilbert - schmidt operatorial formulation to obtain an upper bound to the distance and then look for an optimal element in the algebra saturating this upper bound . in case",
    "at least one such optimal element can be identified , this upper bound itself can obviously be recognised as the true distance .",
    "otherwise one has to be content with the above - mentioned best possible estimate only .",
    "in fact this paper deals with an interplay of both the approaches , as they seem to complement each other in some sense .",
    "this brings out some stark differences between @xmath4 and @xmath8 . particularly for",
    "@xmath8 corresponding to any finite @xmath0-representation of @xmath1 one can not define a geodesic in the conventional sense ; it reduces to commutative @xmath15 only in the limit @xmath16 .",
    "the distance turns out to be much smaller than the geodesic distance of @xmath15 , the latter coinciding with the above - mentioned upper bound .",
    "further in the case of maximal non - commutativity i.e. for @xmath2 , even the finite distance is shown to coincide exactly with the lower bound with @xmath12 playing no role and any pair of pure states is shown to be interpolated by a one - parameter family of mixed states , lying in the interior of @xmath8 .",
    "the distance between any mixed state to the nearest pure state can be taken as a measure of the ` mixedness ' .",
    "+ the whole analysis , particularly the `` ball condition '' is carried out in the eigen - spinor basis furnished by the respective dirac operators .",
    "this is clearly a natural choice of basis , as the ball condition involves the dirac operator .",
    "this definitely simplifies the computations considerably and even allows us to study the geometry of @xmath8 for @xmath17 , apart from reproducing many of the existing results in the literature , albeit with the help of _",
    "mathematica_. however the corresponding analysis for @xmath18 remains quite intractable , even with _",
    "mathematica_. + the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we provide a brief review of the hilbert - schmidt operatorial formulation of non - commutative quantum mechanics on the 2d - moyal plane and fuzzy sphere and the associated spectral triples , introduced in @xcite - required to study the geometrical aspects of them .",
    "we also introduce the corresponding dirac operators and their eigen - spinors for both non - commutative spaces .",
    "to begin , we revisit the derivation of the formula given in @xcite in section [ sec5 ] and derive the corrected form .",
    "we then provide a computation of ( finite ) distances on the moyal plane in the coherent and the  harmonic oscillator \" basis in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] , respectively .",
    "we then proceed onto the case of the fuzzy sphere in quite the same way adopted as in the moyal plane in section [ sec6 ] .",
    "we note some fundamental differences from the case of the moyal plane and adopt a different algorithm using the dirac eigen - spinors and study the @xmath2 and @xmath17 representations of the fuzzy sphere algebra .",
    "we finally conclude in section [ sec_con ] .",
    "the hilbert - schmidt operatorial formulation of non - commutative quantum mechanics ( ncqm ) on the 2d moyal plane @xcite , described by the non - commutative heisenberg algebra i.e. the co - ordinate algebra augmented by the following commutation relations involving linear momenta operators @xmath19 satisfying ( in units of @xmath20 )    @xmath21 = i \\delta_{ij } ~~;~~ [ \\hat{p}_i , \\hat{p}_j ] = 0 \\label{ha}\\ ] ]    begins by introducing an auxiliary hilbert space @xmath22 furnishing a representation of just the coordinate algebra ( [ mp ] ) . in this particular situation , since the algebra ( [ mp ] ) is isomorphic to the algebra @xmath23 = i$ ] of a 1d harmonic oscillator , @xmath22 can be constructed exactly in the same manner i.e.    @xmath24    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the respective lowering and raising operators satisfying @xmath27 = 1 $ ] and the `` ground state '' @xmath28 satisfy @xmath29 .",
    "this @xmath22 , however , can not furnish a representation of the linear momentum operators @xmath30 . as shown in @xcite ,",

    "apart from the  harmonic oscillator \" basis @xmath44 , introduced in , satisfying @xmath45 , one can also introduce normalized coherent states in terms of a dimensionless complex number @xmath46 as    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is a unitary operator furnishing a projective representation of the translation group .",
    "these states provide an over - complete basis in @xmath22 .",

    "this represents a quantum state with maximal localization , where the position measure must now be interpreted in the context of a weak measurement ( positive operator - valued measurement , povm ) rather than a strong measurement ( projective valued measurement , pvm ) .",
    "as was shown in @xcite this quantum hilbert space @xmath31 has a built - in structure of an algebra in the sense that under the multiplication map @xmath53 the usual operator product of any arbitrary pair of elements @xmath54 yields another element of @xmath31 :    @xmath55 in the coherent state i.e. @xmath56 is obtained by composing the respective representations of individual states i.e. @xmath57 and @xmath58 by using the voros star product @xmath59 :    @xmath60    furthermore , it was shown in @xcite that @xmath61 also provides an over - complete basis on @xmath31 - the counterpart of @xmath62 , provided that they are composed using the above mentioned voros star product :    @xmath63    correspondingly , one can introduce the unnormalized projection operators    @xmath64    which are positive ( i.e. @xmath65 ) but unnormalized ( @xmath66 ) and non - orthogonal .",
    "they , however , form a complete basis and therefore provide a povm ( positive operator valued measure ) that one can use to provide a consistent probability interpretation by assigning the probability density    @xmath67    of finding the outcome of a position measurement to be @xmath68 if the system is in a state described by the density matrix @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath70 is a pure state density matrix , then    @xmath71    which clearly goes into the corresponding commutative result in the limit @xmath72 .",
    "+ we briefly mention in this context that , just as the basis @xmath61 has a natural association with the voros star product , it was shown in @xcite that one can like - wise construct an appropriate basis , which is naturally associated with the moyal star product @xmath73 ( in the cartesian @xmath74 basis ) .",
    "however , this basis is somewhat unphysical in the sense that it is the common eigenstate of mathematically constructed unphysical commuting position - like observables @xmath75 , obtained by taking the average of left and right actions of @xmath76 as @xmath77 satisfying @xmath78 = 0 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , they do not conform to the requirement of a povm , unlike the voros case discussed above . besides , the representation of the quantum states in this moyal basis lead to a different class of functions than the corresponding voros ones .",
    "this implies that the equivalence between different choices of star products can not be guaranteed , especially in a path integral formulations , without taking due care of this point .",
    "hence the classical configuration space @xmath90 of a fuzzy space of type ( [ fs ] ) is given by @xmath91 each @xmath0 corresponds to the fixed sphere of radius @xmath92 such that for a fixed @xmath0 the corresponding hilbert sub - space is a @xmath93-dimensional sub - space @xmath94 however , since the quantum hilbert space , in which the physical states are represented , consists of those operators generated by coordinate operators only and since these commute with the casimir the elements of the quantum hilbert space must in addition commute with the casimir , i.e. , must be diagonal in @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the quantum hilbert space @xmath31 of the fuzzy space of type ( [ fs ] ) splits into the direct sum of sub - spaces as follows : @xmath95 where @xmath96 represents the quantum hilbert space of a fuzzy sphere with fixed radius @xmath92 .",

    "note that any action of @xmath84 on the state @xmath99 does not change it so that the group element generated by @xmath84 is the stability subgroup of @xmath1 .",
    "this implies that the set of generalized coherent states of @xmath1 is topologically isomorphic to the coset space @xmath109 .",
    "however , geometrically it reduces to @xmath15 only in the limit @xmath110 .    we know that the operator @xmath111 can be expressed in terms of euler angles as @xmath112 @xcite . for @xmath15 , @xmath113 such that a generic coherent state specified by a point on @xmath15 is given by @xmath114 here",

    "the basic ingredients of studying the geometrical content , particularly connes distance on @xmath22 is facilitated by specifying the spectral triple @xmath117 where the algebra @xmath118 is identified with @xmath31 as mentioned above ( [ multi - map ] ) and the hilbert space @xmath119 is the module and identified with @xmath120 so that it represents the space of appropriate  spinors \" where a typical element @xmath121 acts on @xmath122 through the diagonal representation @xmath123 as @xmath124 the dirac operator , as explained in detail in @xcite ( see also the appendix a ) , is identified as    @xmath125    having a well - defined left action on @xmath120 as @xmath126 the eigen - spinors of the dirac operator for the moyal plane are given by the following , @xmath127 with the eigenvalues @xmath128 for any state @xmath129 given by @xmath130    they furnish a complete and orthonormal basis for @xmath120 , so that the resolution of the identity takes the form @xmath131      for the fuzzy sphere the spectral triple was already constructed in @xcite",
    ". we will be working with the same one here .",
    "the spectral triple consists of the algebra @xmath132 , the hilbert space @xmath133 , and the dirac operator @xmath134 where @xmath135 is related to @xmath136 by @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the usual ladder operators .",
    "as mentioned earlier we will make use of the dirac eigen - spinors @xmath139 , which for the fuzzy sphere are given by @xcite @xmath140 with @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "the respective eigenvalues are given by @xmath143 for any @xmath144 or @xmath145 .",

    "for example , if @xmath148 in corresponds to the @xmath2 representation i.e. @xmath149 , then it will split into the direct sum of @xmath17 ( triplet ) and @xmath150 ( singlet ) representations of three and one dimension , respectively .",

    "pure states play a rather fundamental role and are defined as those functionals that can not be written as a convex linear combination of two other functionals .",

    "the present analysis will also assume the above conditions .",
    "the first two conditions are actually quite mild and just imply that a generic state @xmath151 can be represented by a density matrix @xmath161 .",
    "furthermore , if the state @xmath151 is pure , then the corresponding density matrix @xmath161 too will be pure . more specifically , to illustrate through an example , let us consider the case of the moyal plane @xmath162 - parametrized by the complex number @xmath101 .",
    "it has a one - to - one correspondence with the coherent state @xmath163 or more precisely the density matrix @xmath164 .",

    "since both @xmath161 and @xmath174 are elements of @xmath175 , the connes distance between a pair of states , now represented by density matrices @xmath161 and @xmath176 , can be recast in terms of the inner product as @xmath177 on the other hand the third condition implies a certain irreducibility condition , as explained in @xcite , @xcite . in this context , it is worthwhile to recall another important role of the third condition in the present analysis .",

    "consequently , the distance between any pair of states , belonging to different latitudes diverges and distance between those belonging to the same latitude can only be finite and calculated .",

    "the spectral distance will also diverge .",

    "we are not interested in this kind of pathological states and our entire analysis will be restricted to the cases where the above mentioned conditions hold .",
