    "our general aim is to build up relativity theories as theories in the sense of mathematical logic .",
    "so we axiomatize relativity theories within pure first - order logic ( fol ) using simple , comprehensible and transparent basic assumptions ( axioms ) .",
    "we strive to prove all the surprising predictions of relativity from a minimal number of convincing axioms .",
    "we eliminate tacit assumptions from relativity by replacing them with explicit axioms ( in the spirit of the foundation of mathematics and tarski s axiomatization of geometry ) .",
    "we also elaborate logical and conceptual analysis of our theories .",
    "logical axiomatization of physics , especially that of relativity theory , is not a new idea , among others , it goes back to such leading scientists as hilbert , reichenbach , carnap , gdel , and tarski .",
    "relativity theory was intimately connected to logic from the beginning , it was one of the central subjects of logical positivism . for a short survey on the broader literature ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "our aims go beyond these approaches in that along with axiomatizing relativity theories we also analyze in detail their logical and conceptual structure and , in general , investigate them in various ways ( using our logical framework as a starting point ) .",
    "a novelty in our approach is that we try to keep the transition from special relativity to general relativity logically transparent and illuminating .",
    "we `` derive '' the axioms of general relativity from those of special relativity in two natural steps .",
    "first we extend our axiom system for special relativity with accelerated observers ( sec.[acc - sec ] ) .",
    "then we eliminate the distinguished status of inertial observers at the level of axioms ( sec.[gen - sec ] ) .",
    "some of the questions we study to clarify the logical structure of relativity theories are :    * what is believed and why ?",
    "* which axioms are responsible for certain predictions ? * what happens if we discard some axioms ?",
    "* can we change the axioms and at what price ?",
    "our aims stated in the first paragraph reflect , partly , the fact that we axiomatize a physical theory .",
    "namely , in physics the role of axioms ( the role of statements that we assume without proofs ) is more fundamental than in mathematics . among others ,",
    "this is why we aim to formulate simple , logically transparent and intuitively convincing axioms.our goal is that on our approach , surprising or unusual predictions be theorems and not assumed as axioms .",
    "for example , the prediction `` no faster than light motion ... '' is a theorem on our approach and not an axiom , see thm.[thm - noftl ] .",
    "getting rid of unnecessary axioms is especially important in a physical theory .",
    "when we check the applicability of a physical theory in a situation , we have to check whether the axioms of the theory hold or not .",
    "for this we often use empirical facts ( outcomes of concrete experiments ) .",
    "however , these correspond to existentially quantified theorems rather than to universally quantified statementswhich the axioms usually are .",
    "thus while we can easily disprove the axioms by referring to empirical facts , we can verify these axioms only to a certain degree .",
    "some of the literature uses the term empirical fact for universal generalization of an empirical fact elevated to the level of axioms , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we simply call these generalizations ( empirical ) axioms .",
    "for one thing , einstein s theory of relativity not just had but still has a great impact on many areas of science .",
    "it has also greatly affected several areas in the philosophy of science .",
    "relativity theory has an impact even on our every day life , e.g. , via gps technology ( which can not work without relativity theory ) .",
    "any theory with such an impact is also interesting from the point of view of axiomatic foundations and logical analysis .    since spacetime is a similar geometrical object as space , axiomatization of relativity theories ( or spacetime theories in general )",
    "is a natural continuation of the works of euclid , hilbert , tarski and many others axiomatizing the geometry of space .",
    "there are many examples showing the benefits of using axiomatic method . for example , if we decompose relativity theories into little parts ( axioms ) , we can check what happens to our theory if we drop , weaken or replace an axiom or we can take any prediction , such as the twin paradox , and check which axiom is and which is not needed to derive it . this kind of reverse thinking helps to answer the why - type questions . for details on answering why - type questions by the methodology of the present work , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the success story of axiomatic method in the foundations of mathematics also suggests that it is worth applying this method in the foundations of spacetime theories @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us note here that euclid s axiomatic - deductive approach to geometry also made a great impression on the young einstein , see @xcite .    among others",
    ", logical analysis makes relativity theory modular : we can change some axioms , and our logical machinery ensures that we can continue working in the modified theory .",
    "this modularity might come handy , e.g. , when we want to unify general relativity and quantum theory to a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "for further reasons why to apply the axiomatic method to spacetime theories , see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we aim to provide a logical foundation for spacetime theories similar to the rather successful foundations of mathematics , which , for good reasons , was performed strictly within fol .",
    "one of these reasons is that fol helps to avoid tacit assumptions .",
    "another is that fol has a complete inference system while second - order logic ( or higher - order logic ) can not have one .",
    "still another reason for choosing fol is that it can be viewed as a fragment of natural language with unambiguous syntax and semantics .",
    "being a _ fragment of natural language _ is useful in our project because one of our aims is to make relativity theory accessible to a broad audience . _ unambiguous syntax and semantics _",
    "are important , because they make it possible for the reader to always know what is stated and what is not stated by the axioms .",
    "therefore they can use the axioms without being familiar with all the tacit assumptions and rules of thumb of physics ( which one usually learns via many , many years of practice ) .    for further reasons why to stay within fol",
    "when dealing with axiomatic foundations , see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "*  appendix : why fol ? ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "before we present our axiom system let us go back to einstein s original ( logically non - formalized ) postulates .",
    "einstein based his special theory of relativity on two postulates , the principle of relativity and the light principle : `` the laws by which the states of physical systems undergo change are not affected , whether these changes of state be referred to the one or the other of two systems of coordinates in uniform translatory motion . '' and `` any ray of light moves in the ` stationary ' system of co - ordinates with the determined velocity @xmath0 , whether the ray be emitted by a stationary or by a moving body . '' , see @xcite .",
    "the logical formulation of einstein s principle of relativity is not an easy task since it is difficult to capture axiomatically what `` the laws of nature '' are in general .",
    "nevertheless , the principle of relativity can be captured by our fol approach , see @xcite , @xcite .    instead of formulating the two original principles , we formulate the following consequence of theirs : `` the speed of light signals is the same in every direction everywhere according to every inertial observer '' ( and not just according to the ` stationary ' observer ) . here",
    "we will base our axiomatization on this consequence and call it light axiom .",
    "we will soon see that the light axiom can be regarded as the key assumption of special relativity .",
    "since we want to axiomatize special relativity , we have to fix some formal language in which we will write up our axioms .",
    "let us see the basic concepts ( the  vocabulary \" of the fol language ) we will use .",
    "we would like to speak about motion .",
    "so we need a basic concept of things that can move . we will call these object _",
    "bodies_. the light axiom requires a distinguished type of bodies called _ photons _ or _",
    "light signals_. we will represent motion as the changing of spatial location in time . thus we will use reference frames for coordinatizing events ( meetings of bodies ) .",
    "time and space will be marked by _",
    "the structure of quantities will be an _ ordered field _ in place of the field of real numbers . for simplicity , we will associate special bodies to reference frames .",
    "these special bodies will be called `` observers .",
    "'' observations will be formalized / represented by means of the _ worldview relation_.    to formalize the ideas above , let us fix a natural number @xmath1 for the dimension of spacetime . to axiomatize theories of the @xmath2-dimensional spacetime , we will use the following two - sorted fol language : @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( bodies ) and @xmath5 ( quantities ) are the two sorts , @xmath6 ( inertial observers ) and @xmath7 ( light signals or photons ) are one - place relation symbols of sort @xmath4 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two - place function symbols of sort @xmath5 , and @xmath10 ( the worldview relation ) is a @xmath11-place relation symbol the first two arguments of which are of sort @xmath4 and the rest are of sort @xmath5 .",
    "atomic formulas @xmath12 and @xmath13 are translated as `` _ _",
    "@xmath14 is an inertial observer _ _ , '' and `` _",
    "_ @xmath15 is a photon _ _ , '' respectively . to speak about coordinatization",
    ", we translate @xmath16 as `` _ _ body @xmath14 coordinatizes body @xmath17 at space - time location @xmath18 _ _ , '' ( i.e. , at space location @xmath19 and at instant @xmath20 ) .",
    "sometimes we use the more picturesque expressions _ sees _ or _ observes _ for _ coordinatizes_. however , these cases of `` seeing '' and `` observing '' have nothing to do with visual seeing or observing ; they only mean associating coordinate points to bodies .",
    "the above , together with statements of the form @xmath21 are the so - called _ atomic formulas _ of our fol language , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be arbitrary variables of the same sort , or terms built up from variables of sort @xmath5 by using the two - place operations @xmath9 and @xmath8 .",
    "the _ formulas _ are built up from these atomic formulas by using the logical connectives _ not _",
    "( @xmath24 ) , _ and _ ( @xmath25 ) , _ or _ ( @xmath26 ) , _ implies _ ( @xmath27 ) , _ if - and - only - if _ ( @xmath28 ) and the quantifiers _ exists _ ( @xmath29 ) and _ for all _ ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "for the precise definition of the syntax and semantics of fol , see , e.g. , @xcite . to meaningfully formulate the light axiom",
    ", we have to provide some algebraic structure for the quantities .",
    "therefore , in our first axiom , we state some usual properties of addition @xmath8 and multiplication @xmath9 true for real numbers .    : :    the quantity part @xmath31 is a euclidean field , i.e. , +    @xmath32 @xmath33    is a field in the sense of abstract algebra , +    @xmath32 the relation @xmath34 defined by    @xmath35 is a linear ordering on    @xmath5 , and +    @xmath32 positive elements have square roots :    @xmath36 .",
    "the field - axioms ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) say that @xmath8 , @xmath9 are associative and commutative , they have neutral elements @xmath37 , @xmath38 and inverses @xmath39 , @xmath40 respectively , with the exception that @xmath37 does not have an inverse with respect to @xmath41 , as well as @xmath9 is additive with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "we will use @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath42 as derived ( i.e. , defined ) operation symbols .",
    "@xmath43 is a  mathematical \" axiom in spirit .",
    "however , it has physical ( even empirical ) relevance .",
    "its physical relevance is that we can add and multiply the outcomes of our measurements and some basic rules apply to these operations .",
    "physicists usually use all properties of the real numbers tacitly , without stating explicitly which property is assumed and why .",
    "the two properties of real numbers which are the most difficult to defend from an empirical point of view are the archimedean property , see @xcite , @xcite , and the supremum property , see the remark after the introduction of axiom @xmath44 on p ..    euclidean fields got their name after their role in tarski s fol axiomatization of euclidean geometry @xcite .",
    "by @xmath43 we can reason about the euclidean structure of a coordinate system the usual way , we can introduce euclidean distance , speak about straight lines , etc .",
    "in particular , we will use the following notation for @xmath45 ( i.e. , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are @xmath48-tuples over @xmath5 ) if @xmath49 : @xmath50    we will also use the following two notations : @xmath51 for the _ space component _ and the _ time component _ of @xmath52 , respectively .    now let us see how the light axiom can be formalized in our fol language .    : :    for any inertial observer , the speed of light is the same in every    direction everywhere , and it is finite .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to    send out a light signal in any direction .",
    "formally :    @xmath53    axiom @xmath54 has an immediate physical meaning .",
    "this axiom is not only implied by the two original principles of relativity , but it is well supported by experiments , such as the michelson - morley experiment .",
    "moreover , it has been continuously tested ever since then .",
    "nowadays it is tested by gps technology .",
    "axiom @xmath54 says that `` it is _ possible _ for a photon to move from @xmath46 to @xmath47 iff ... '' .",
    "so , a notion of possibility plays a role here . in the present paper we work in an extensional framework , as is customary in geometry and in spacetime theory .",
    "however , it would be more natural to treat this  possibility phenomenon \" in a modal logic framework , and this is more emphatically so for relativistic dynamics @xcite . it would be interesting to explore the use of modal logic in our logical analysis of relativity theory",
    ". this investigation would be a nice unification of the works of imre ruzsa s school on modal logic and the works of our tarskian spirited school on axiomatic foundations of relativity theory .",
    "robin hirsch s work can be considered as a first step along this road @xcite .",
    "let us note that @xmath54 does not require that the speed of light be the same for every inertial observer or that it be nonzero .",
    "it requires only that the speed of light according to a fixed inertial observer be a quantity which does not depend on the direction or the location .",
    "why do we not require that the speed of light is nonzero ?",
    "the main reason is that we are building our logical foundation of spacetime theories examining thoroughly each part of each axiom to see where and why we should assume them .",
    "another ( more technical ) reason is that it will be more natural to include this assumption ( @xmath55 ) in our auxiliary axiom @xmath56 on page  .    our next axiom connects the worldviews of different inertial observers by saying that all observers observe the same  external \" reality ( the same set of events ) .",
    "intuitively , by the event occurring for @xmath57 at @xmath46 , we mean the set of bodies @xmath57 observes at @xmath46 .",
    "formally : @xmath58    : :    all inertial observers coordinatize the same set of events :    @xmath59    this axiom is very natural and tacitly assumed in the non - axiomatic approaches to special relativity , too",
    ".    basically we are done .",
    "we have formalized the light axiom @xmath54 .",
    "we have introduced two supporting axioms ( @xmath43 and @xmath60 ) for the light axiom which are simple and natural ; however , we can not simply omit them without loosing some of the meaning of @xmath54 .",
    "the field axiom enables us to speak about distances , time differences , speeds , etc .",
    "the event axiom ensures that different inertial observers see the same events .    in principle",
    ", we do not need more axioms for analyzing / axiomatizing special relativity , but let us introduce two more simplifying ones .",
    "we could leave them out without loosing the essence of our theory , it is just that the formalizations of the theorems would become more complicated .",
    ": :    any inertial observer sees himself on the time axis :    @xmath61    the role of @xmath62 is nothing more than making it easier to speak about the motion of reference frames via the motion of their time axes .",
    "identifying the motion of reference frames with the motion of their time axes is a standard simplification in the literature .",
    "@xmath62 is a way to formally capture this simplifying identification .",
    "our last axiom is a symmetry axiom saying that all inertial observers use the same units of measurements .",
    ": :    [ axsymd ] any two inertial observers agree about the spatial distance    between two events if these two events are simultaneous for both of    them ; furthermore , the speed of light is 1 :    @xmath63    @xmath64    let us see how @xmath56 states that `` all inertial observers use the same units of measurements . ''",
    "that `` the speed of light is 1 '' ( besides that the speed of light is nonzero ) means only that observers are using units measuring time distances compatible with the units measuring spatial distances , such as light years or light seconds .",
    "the first part of @xmath56 means that different observers use the same unit measuring spatial distances .",
    "this is so because if two events are simultaneous for both observers , they can measure their spatial distance and the outcome of their measurements are the same iff the two observers are using the same units to measure spatial distances .",
    "our axiom system for special relativity contains these 5 axioms only : @xmath65    in an axiom system , the axioms are the  price \" we pay , and the theorems are the  goods \" we get for them .",
    "therefore , we strive for putting only simple , transparent , easy - to - believe statements in our axiom systems .",
    "we want to get all the hard - to - believe predictions as theorems .",
    "for example , we prove from @xmath66 that it is impossible for inertial observers to move faster than light relative to each other (  no ftl travel \" for science fiction fans ) . in the following",
    ", @xmath67 means logical derivability .",
    "( no faster than light inertial observers ) [ thm - noftl ] @xmath68    for a geometrical proof of thm.[thm - noftl ] , see @xcite .",
    "in relativity theory we are often interested in comparing the worldviews of different observers .",
    "so we introduce the worldview transformation between observers @xmath57 and @xmath14 as the following binary relation : @xmath69    by thm.[thm - poi ] , the worldview transformations between inertial observers in the models of @xmath66 are poincar transformations , i.e. , transformations which preserve the so - called minkowski - distance @xmath70 of @xmath2-tuples @xmath71 . for the definition ,",

    "* thm.11.10 , 640 . ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm.3.2.2 , 22 . ) . by thm.[thm - poi ] , all predictions of special relativity , such as `` moving clocks slow down , '' are provable from @xmath66 . for details ,",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "let us illustrate here by a simple example what we mean by logical analysis of a theory .",
    "in @xmath60 we have assumed that all observers see the same ( possibly infinite ) meetings of bodies .",
    "let us try to weaken @xmath60 to an axiom assuming something similar but only for finite meetings of bodies .",
    "a natural candidate is one of the following finite approximations of @xmath60 :    : :    all inertial observers see the same @xmath48-meetings of    bodies : @xmath73    for example , @xmath74 means only that inertial observers see the same bodies .",
    "let us also introduce axiom scheme @xmath75 as the collection of all the axioms @xmath76 . by prop.[prop - meet ]",
    ", @xmath76 is strictly weaker assumption than @xmath77 and @xmath60 is strictly stronger than all the axioms of @xmath75 together .",

    "so @xmath60 is not valid in this model .",

    "the latter is true because @xmath44 does not speak about `` any fancy subset '' of the quantities , just those `` physically meaningful '' sets which can be defined in the language of our ( physical ) theory .    adding this 5 axioms to @xmath66 , we get an axiom system for accelerated observers : @xmath152    as an example we show that the so - called _ twin paradox _ can be naturally formulated and analyzed logically in @xmath151 .",

    "we introduce an axiom system for general relativity as the collection of the following axioms : @xmath166    axiom system @xmath160 contains basically the same axioms as @xmath66 , the difference is that they are assumed only locally but for all the observers .",
    "thm.[grcomp - thm ] below states that the models of @xmath160 are exactly the spacetimes of usual general relativity . for the notion of a lorentzian manifold",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "after this is elaborated , we have defined what we mean by a formula @xmath168 in the language of @xmath160 being valid in a lorentzian manifold .",
    "then completeness means that for any formula @xmath168 in the language of @xmath160 , we have @xmath169 iff @xmath168 is valid in all lorentzian manifolds over real closed fields .",

    "according to the definition above , if there are only a few observers , then it is not a big deal that a worldline is a time - like geodesic ( it is easy to be maximal if there are only a few to be compared to ) . to generate a real competition for the rank of having a timelike geodesic worldline",
    ", we postulate the existence of many observers by the following axiom scheme of comprehension .",
    ": :    for any parametrically definable timelike curve in any observers    worldview , there is another observer whose worldline is the range of    this curve .",
    "a precise formulation of @xmath170 can be obtained from that of its variant in @xcite .    an axiom schema @xmath170 guarantees that our definition of a geodesic coincides with that in the literature on lorentzian manifolds .",
    "therefore we also introduce the following theory : @xmath171 so in our theory @xmath172 , our concept of timelike geodesic coincides with the standard concept in the literature on general relativity .",

    "provide the connection between the geometry of spacetime and the energy - matter distribution ( given by the energy - momentum tensor field ) .",
    "since in @xmath172 all the geometric concepts of spacetime are definable , we can use einstein s equation as a definition of the energy - momentum tensor , see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite , or we can extend the language of @xmath172 with the concept of energy - momentum tensor and assume einstein s equations as axioms .",
    "as long as we do not assume anything more of the energy - momentum tensor than its connection to the geometry described by einstein s equations , there is no real difference in these two approaches . in both approaches ,",
    "we can add extra conditions about the energy - momentum tensor to our theory , e.g. , the dominant energy condition or , e.g. , that the spacetimes are vacuum solutions .",
    "there is observational evidence suggesting that in our physical universe there exist regions supporting potential non - turing computations .",
    "namely , it is possible to design a physical device in relativistic spacetime which can compute a non - turing computable task , e.g. , which can decide whether zf set theory is consistent .",
    "this empirical evidence is making the theory of hypercomputation more interesting and gives new challenges to the physical church thesis , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "these new challenges do more than simply providing a further connection between logic and spacetime theories ; they also motivate the need for logical understanding of spacetime theories .",
    "we have axiomatized both special and general relativity in fol . moreover , via our theory @xmath151 , we have axiomatized general relativity so that each of its axioms can be traced back to its roots in the axioms of special relativity .",
