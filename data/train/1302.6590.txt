    "the underlying nature of the dark matter halos of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsphs ) has garnered significant attention from the scientific community over the past decade .",
    "the goal of recent observational studies of these objects has been to make critical tests of structure formation scenarios , particularly focusing on the viability of the canonical @xmath5cdm model .",
    "there is the long standing issue of the relative dearth of these faintest of galaxies observed surrounding nearby galaxies when compared with the number of dark matter subhalos produced in @xmath6body simulations , which is referred to as the `` missing satellite '' problem @xcite . the extent to which this mismatch is considered problematic",
    "has decreased over recent years as both theorists and observers have sought to reconcile the simulated and observable universe . from a modelling point of view , one does not expect stars to be able to form within all dark matter subhalos seen in simulations , and at a certain mass limit ( @xmath7 , see @xcite ) , star formation is unable to proceed . thus , there is a lower limit placed on galaxy formation .",
    "this mass limit is also tied to feedback processes that can remove the baryonic reservoirs required for star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this would imply that only the most massive subhalos seen in simulations are able to form and retain luminous populations .",
    "observers have also attempted to quantify current survey completeness and radial selection effects to account for the number of satellites we are not currently able to detect ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these studies suggest that there are of order a few hundred satellites within the milky way s virial radius that we have yet to detect .",
    "the high dark matter dominance of dsph galaxies also singles them out as objects of interest . with total dynamic mass - to - light ratios of @xmath3\\sim10 - 1000$]s and half - light radii of @xmath8  pc , they are ideal systems with which to probe the inner density profiles of dark matter halos . recent imaging and spectroscopic observations of these objects within the local group",
    "have shown that , despite spanning approximately 5 decades in luminosity , the dsphs of the mw share a common mass scale and a universal density profile @xcite . with a kinematic resolution of a few 10s of parsecs ,",
    "these objects allow us to start addressing the question of whether the central regions of these halos follow cuspy density profiles as predicted by cosmological simulations @xcite , or constant density cores , similar to what is observed in low surface brightness galaxies @xcite . from studies of brighter dsphs , such as sculptor and fornax @xcite it appears that their halo density profiles are also inconsistent with hosting central cusps .",
    "it is possible that these objects originally formed with cuspy density profiles , and that these have been subsequently modified by baryonic feedback . if this is truly the case , one should be able to observe cuspy profiles in the fainter dsph population ( @xcite ) as these do not contain enough baryons to drive this change in the dark matter density profile .",
    "perhaps the only way to gain further insight into this contentious issue is by measuring the kinematics for large numbers of stellar tracers within these objects and analysing them with detailed models that do not make _ ab initio _ assumptions about the underlying density profiles , or the velocity anisotropy of both the dark matter and stars , such as those employed by @xcite and @xcite .    to date",
    ", the majority of studies involving the detailed kinematics of dsphs have revolved largely around those belonging to the milky way , as these are nearby enough that we can measure the velocities of their member stars to a high degree of accuracy . however , there are currently only @xmath9 known mw dsphs , with luminosities ranging from @xmath10 . for the very faintest ,",
    "some controversy remains as to whether they are massively dark - matter dominated ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , but almost all of them have been shown to be consistent with the universal mass profiles of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one notable exception to this is the hercules object @xcite , which some have argued is currently undergoing significant tidal disruption @xcite .",
    "andromeda represents the only other system for which comparable kinematic analyses can be performed .",
    "m31 now has 28 dsph companions known , whose luminosities range from @xmath11 , the majority of which have been discovered by the cfht pan - andromeda archaeological survey ( pandas @xcite ) .",
    "the relatively brighter lower bound for the luminosities of m31 dsphs compared to the mw is a detection limit issue , rather than a sign of differing stellar populations ( martin et al .",
    "2013 , in prep ) .",
    "it has been noted by a number of authors ( e.g. , @xcite ) that for the brighter dsphs ( @xmath12 ) , those belonging to m31 are 23 times more extended in terms of their half - light ( @xmath13 ) and tidal ( @xmath14 ) radii compared with the mw . in these papers , the underlying cause of this discrepancy was not identified , but it has been argued that it could be an effect of environment , with the mass distribution of the host playing an important role .",
    "subsequent work by @xcite , who included the fainter , non - classic m31 dsphs for the first time , showed that statistically , the relationship between size and luminosity for dsphs in the mw and andromeda are actually largely consistent with one another , however there remain a number of significantly extended outliers within the andromedean system ( e.g. , and ii , and xix , @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively ) , and the scatter in this relationship is large ( up to an order of magnitude at a given luminosity , @xcite ) .    working from the @xcite results",
    ", @xcite modelled the expected velocity dispersions for the m31 dsphs , assuming that all dsph galaxies are embedded within similar mass dark matter halos .",
    "a robust prediction of their modeling was that , given the larger radial extents , the dsphs of m31 should be _ kinematically hotter _ than their mw counterparts by a factor of @xmath17 . at the time of writing , they had only 2 measured velocity dispersions for the m31 dsphs , those of and ii and and ix @xcite .",
    "new studies of the kinematics of m31 dsphs @xcite have dramatically increased the number of systems with a measured velocity dispersion , and have shown that instead of being kinematically hotter , these systems are either very similar to , or in a number of cases ( e.g. , and ii , and xii , and xiv , and xv and and xxii ) , _ colder _ than their mw counterparts . in particular , a significant recent kinematic study of 15 m31 dsph companions using the keck ii deimos spectrograph by the spectroscopic and photometric landscape of andromeda s stellar halo ( splash , @xcite ) concluded that the m31 dsph system largely obeys very similar mass - size - luminosity scalings as those of the mw .",
    "however , they also identified 3 outliers ( and xiv , xv and xvi ) that appear to possess much lower velocity dispersions , and hence maximum circular velocities , than would be expected for these systems .",
    "such a result suggests that there are significant differences in the formation and/or evolution of the m31 and mw dsph systems .    to investigate this",
    "further , our group has been systematically surveying the known dsphs of m31 with the keck i lris and keck ii deimos spectrographs , and have obtained kinematic data for 18 of the 28 galaxies . in this paper",
    ", we present new spectroscopic analysis for the 11 dsphs , andromeda ( and ) xvii , and xviii , and xix , and xx , and xxi , and xxiii , and xxiv , and xxv , and xxvi , the tidally disrupting and xxvii , and xxviii and and xxx ( cassiopeia ii ) using an algorithm we have developed that implements a probabilistic method of determining membership for each galaxy . in addition we re - analyze the kinematics of 6 dsphs that our group has previously observed ( and v , vi , xi , xii , xiii , xxii ) using this method with the aim of providing a homogeneous analysis of all dsphs observed by our group to date .",
    "we also provide the individual stellar velocities and properties for every star observed in our dsphs survey , allowing us to present a large catalog of stellar kinematics that will be of interest to those studying dsph systems and milky way - like galaxies , whether observationally or theoretically .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in   2 we discuss the relevant observations , data reduction techniques . in ",
    "3 we outline our algorithm for the classification of member stars . in   4 we present an analysis of our new kinematic datasets . in   5 we report on the masses and densities of the dark matter halos of the m31 dsphs , comparing them to those of the mw dsphs . in ",
    "6 we report on the metallicities , [ fe / h ] , of the m31 dsphs as measured from the co - added spectra of their member stars .",
    "finally , we conclude in   7 .",
    "the pandas survey @xcite , conducted using the 3.6 metre canada france hawaii telescope ( cfht ) , maps out the stellar density of the disc and halo regions of the m31m33 system over a projected area of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) , resolving individual stars to depths of @xmath20 and @xmath21 with a signal to noise ratio of 10 , making this survey the deepest , highest resolution , contiguous map of the majority of the extended stellar halo of an l@xmath22 galaxy to date .",
    "each of the @xmath23 fields in this survey ( @xmath24 deg@xmath25 ) has been observed for at least 1350s in both megacam @xmath26 and @xmath27 filters , in @xmath28 seeing .",
    "this survey was initiated following two precursor surveys of the m31 system , the first of which surveyed the central @xmath29  deg@xmath25 conducted with the 2.5 metre isaac newton telescope @xcite , and revealed a wealth of substructure in the andromeda stellar halo , including the giant southern stream @xcite . to better understand this feature , and to probe deeper into the m31 ( and m33 ) stellar halo , a survey of the south west quadrant of the m31 halo",
    "was initiated using the cfht @xcite , and revealed yet more substructure , including the arc like stream cp and cr @xcite and a number of dwarf spheroidal satellites @xcite .",
    "this cfht survey was then extended into the full pandas project . for details of the processing and reduction of these data ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "this survey has introduced us to a wealth of stellar substructure , debris and globular clusters within the andromeda  triangulum system .",
    "in addition , it has led to the discovery of 17 dsphs .",
    "these objects were detected in the pandas survey maps as over - densities in matched - filter surface density maps of metal poor red giant branch ( rgb ) stars and were presented in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "stars lying directly on the rgb , with @xmath66 and distance , @xmath67 ( where @xmath13 is the half - light radius , measured on the semi - major axis of the dsph ) were highly prioritised ( priority a ) , followed by stars on the rgb within the same distance from the centre with @xmath68 ( priority b ) .",

    "for this object , target selection followed an identical methodology tot hat detailed above , but used photometry from the 8th data release of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss - iii ) .",
    "details of the observations and analysis of this photometry can be found in @xcite .",
    "the deep - imaging multi - object spectrograph ( deimos ) , situated on the nasmyth focus of the keck ii telescope is an ideal instrument for obtaining medium resolution ( r@xmath71 ) spectra of multiple , faint stellar targets in the m31 dsphs .",
    "the data for the dsphs within this work were taken between sept 2004 and sept 2012 in photometric conditions , with typical seeing between @xmath72 .",
    "our chosen instrumental setting covered the observed wavelength range from 56009800  and employed exposure times of 3x20 minute integrations .",

    "briefly , the pipeline identifies and removes cosmic rays , corrects for scattered light , performs flat - fielding to correct for pixel - to - pixel variations , corrects for illumination , slit function and fringing , wavelength calibrates each pixel using arc - lamp exposures , performs a 2-dimensional sky subtraction , and finally extracts each spectra  without resampling  in a small spatial region around the target .",
    "this results in a large set of pixels for each target , each of which carries a flux and wavelength ( with associated uncertainties ) plus the value of the target spatial profile at that pixel .",

    "there are several methods in the literature for this ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but recent work by @xcite has shown that the mass contained within the half - light radius ( @xmath265)of these objects can be reliably estimated using the following formula :    @xmath266    where @xmath267km@xmath268s@xmath25 , @xmath13 is the spherical half - light radius in pc and @xmath269 is the luminosity- averaged velocity dispersion .",
    "this mass estimator is independent of the ( unknown ) velocity anisotropy of the tracer population , however , it is sensitive to the embeddedness of the stellar component within the dm halo .",
    "particularly , the mass tends to be slightly over - estimated the more embedded the stars are @xcite , especially if the dark matter halo follows a cored density profile .    as numerous authors have shown that the velocity dispersion profiles of dsphs are constant with radius ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we assume our measured values of @xmath128 are representative of the luminosity - averaged velocity dispersion ( @xmath269 ) used by @xcite .",

    "this result therefore adds weight to the trend presented in that work .",
    "a number of recent works trying to account for the lower than predicted central masses of dsph galaxies within the local group also support this notion . for example , @xcite demonstrated that the presence of a massive stellar disk in the host galaxy ( such as those of the mw and m31 ) can significantly reduce the total masses of its associated satellites .",
    "in addition , recent , papers by @xcite and @xcite , where the effect of baryons within dark matter only simulations was measured also find that tidal forces exerted by host galaxies where a massive disk is present will serve to reduce the masses of its satellite population at a far greater rate than hosts without baryons . and",

    "the tidal scenario is therefore slightly difficult to reconcile with these outlying m31 dsphs having the largest sizes , unless they were both more massive and spatially larger in the past .",
    "other recent theoretical works have also shown that the removal of baryons from the very centres of dark matter halos by baryonic feedback ( from star formation and supernovae , for example ) can also help to lower the central masses and densities of satellite galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for this method to work effectively , however , very large ` blow outs ' of gas",

    "using new and existing spectroscopic data from the keck i lris and keck ii deimos spectrographs , we have homogeneously derived kinematic properties for 18 of the 28 known andromeda dsph galaxies . using a combination of their @xmath0 colors , positions on the sky and radial velocities",
    ", we determine the likelihood of each observed star belonging to a given dsph , thus filtering out mw foreground or m31 halo contaminants .",
    "we have measured both their systemic velocities and their velocity dispersions , with the latter allowing us to constrain the mass and densities within their half - light radii . for the first time , we confirm that and xvii , xix , xx , xxiii , xxvi and cass ii are dark matter dominated objects , with dynamical mass - to - light ratios within the half - light radius of @xmath3_{\\rm half}>10\\msun/\\lsun$ ] .    for and xxv , a bright m31 dsph ( @xmath213 ) we measure a mass - to - light ratio of only @xmath3_{\\rm half}=10.3^{+7.0}_{-6.7}\\msun/\\lsun$ ] from a sample of 26 stars , meaning that it is consistent with a simple stellar system with no appreciable dark matter component within its @xmath4 uncertainties .",
    "if this were confirmed with larger datasets , it would prove to be a very important object for our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "we compare our computed velocity dispersions and mass estimates with those measured for mw dsphs , and find that the majority of the m31 dsphs have very similar mass - size scalings to those of the mw .",
    "however , we note 3 significant outliers to these scalings , namely and xix , xxi and xxv , who possess significantly lower velocity dispersions than expected for their size .",
    "these results builds on the identification of three potential outliers in the @xcite dataset ( and xiv , xv and xvi ) .",
    "we suggest that the lower densities of the dark matter halos for these outliers could be an indication that they have encountered greater tidal stresses from their host over the course of their evolution , decreasing their masses .",
    "however , these bright systems still fall on the luminosity - metallicity relation established for the dsph galaxies of the local group .",
    "if these objects had undergone significant tidal disruption , we would expect them to lie above this relation .",
    "as such , this remains puzzling , and requires dedicated follow up studies to fully map out the kinematics of these unusual systems .",
    "we measure the metallicities of all 18 dsphs from their co - added spectra and find that they are consistent with the established mw trend of decreasing metallicity with decreasing luminosity .",
    "this work represents a significant step forward in understanding the mass profiles of dwarf spheroidal galaxies .",
    "far from residing in dark matter halos with identical mass profiles , we show that the halos of these objects are complex , and differ from one to the next , with their environment and tidal evolution imprinting themselves upon the dynamics of their stellar populations .",
    "the andromeda system of dsphs presents us with an opportunity to better understand these processes , and our future work will further illuminate the evolutionary paths taken by these smallest of galaxies .",

    "in t12 , the authors do not impose a velocity probability criterion for their membership calculations .",
    "instead they require all member stars to have a total probability , based on their positions and colors , of @xmath493 , and then apply a @xmath151 clipping to this final sample to prevent any outliers from significantly inflating their calculated velocity dispersions . in our analysis , we have avoided making any hard cuts to our sample by also utilising prior information on the velocities of our expected contaminant populations and member stars . in   [ sect : velprob ] , we tested our velocity probability criteria was not overly biasing our final measurements of velocity dispersion to artificially lower values with the introduction of an extra parameter , @xmath127 , that allows us to add additional weight to stars in the tails of the gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "however , we can further test our velocity criterion by removing it entirely from the probabilistic determination , and instead implementing the same cuts presented by t12 .",
    "this involves cutting stars where @xmath494 ( as determined from @xmath97 and @xmath102 ) , and also by iteratively removing all stars that have velocities that do not lie within @xmath151 of the mean of the remaining sample . in table",

    "[ sect : and27 ] ) the systemic velocities derived are within @xmath495 of one another .",
    "the velocity dispersions we measure from our full algorithm tend to be slightly higher on average , and this is to be expected as we do not cut any stars from our analysis , and therefore outliers in the velocity profile may be assigned non - negligible membership probabilities that will allow them to increase this measurement . by and large ,",
    "these differences are not significant , with the final values agreeing to well within their @xmath4 uncertainties .",
    "it is interesting that our algorithm appears to perform better when dealing with dsphs where the number of member stars is low .",
    "this is best demonstrated by and xi ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : and11 ] ) .",
    "our algorithm identifies 5 stars with non - negligible probabilities of membership , clustered around @xmath496 .",
    "our full algorithm measures a systemic velocity of @xmath497 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath498 .",
    "one of these stars is slightly offset from the other 4 with a more negative velocity of @xmath499 .",
    "although this star has a reasonably high probability of being a member based on its distance from the centre of and xi , and its position in the cmd , it does not survive the @xmath151 velocity clipping procedure of t12 .",
    "as the number of member stars is so low , cutting one star from the sample can have a significant effect , and as such , while the t12 procedure determines a very similar systemic velocity of @xmath500 it is unable to resolve a velocity dispersion .",
    "this effect is also seen other systems ( such as and xiii , xvii , xxii and xxvi ) , although it is typically less pronounced .",
    "another regime where our algorithm performs better than that of t12 is where the systemic velocity of the system in question is within the regime of the contaminating milky way k - dwarfs .",
    "an example of this is the unusual system , and xix , where our algorithm measures a systemic velocity of @xmath179 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath501 .",
    "however , the procedure of t12 is less able to resolve the kinematics of the system , measuring @xmath502 and a velocity dispersion of @xmath503 .",
    "the much larger uncertainty on the dispersion is a result of including milky way contaminants in the sample which can be difficult to cut out without applying prior knowledge of the velocity profile of this population .",
    "@xmath151 clipping allows outliers to contribute more significantly to the measured profile in this instance , increasing the uncertainty .",
    "a similar effect is seen in the and xxiv and and xxx ( cass ii ) objects , which also have systemic velocities in the milky way contamination regime .",
    "these results lead us to conclude that the inclusion of a @xmath109 term in our analysis allows us to more effectively determine the true kinematics of the systems we are studying .",

    "given the demand for facilities such as this , any observing time awarded must be used as effectively as possible , and this often means compromising between deep pointings for a few objects , and shallower pointings for a number of objects . with longer or multiple exposures on a single target , one can build up impressive samples of member stars for an individual dsph .",
    "for example , the splash collaboration observed a total of 95 members in and ii , one of the brightest m31 dsph companions @xcite by taking 2 separate exposure fields over this large object .",
    "however , multiple exposures such as these produce diminishing returns as you move down the luminosity scale to fainter , more compact dsphs .",
    "this is both because of their smaller size with respect to the deimos field of view , and the fewer number of bright stars available on the rgb to target . in this case , the only way to identify more members is by integrating for longer , but given the paucity of stars , the trade - off between time spent exposing and additional members observed can be quite expensive .",
    "such difficulties inevitably lead to the inference of dynamical properties for an entire system from a handful of stars .",

    "we display the resulting values in table  [ tab : sampsz ] , with the true value recovered from the full sample shown in bold in the final row for comparison .",
    "we show that in all these cases , the systemic velocity and velocity dispersion are recovered well within the scatter of the 1000 simulations even when dealing with sample sizes as small as 4 stars , so long as the measurement is resolved . in cases where we are unable to resolve a dispersion , we find that our resulting uncertainties are not meaningful . this is shown explicitly in the case of and xviii , where we can compare our upper limit for the velocity dispersion as determined from our algorithm with the dispersion calculated in t12 from a much larger dataset .",

    "the raw data were also not reduced using our standard pipeline , owing to problems with the arc - lamp calibrations , and were instead analyzed using the noao.onedspec and noao.twodspec packages in iraf .",
    "the results from this reduction , plus an analysis of the data using hard cuts in velocity , distance and color to determine membership were first published in @xcite .",
    "our full probabilistic analysis identifies 17 stars with a non - negligible probability of belonging to and v. our technique determines a systemic velocity of @xmath666 and @xmath667 . comparing these values to our previously published results (",
    "@xmath668 and @xmath669 , @xcite ) we find them to be consistent within the quoted uncertainties .",
    "we also compare our results to those of t12 , who measured @xmath670 and @xmath671 from a larger sample of stars ( 85 members cf .",
    "17 ) using the higher resolution deimos spectrograph .",
    "the velocity dispersions of both are consistent within their @xmath4 uncertainties , as are the systemic velocities .",
    "given the difference of a factor of 5 in number of probable member stars between our study and that of t12 , this consistency is reassuring , and demonstrates the ability of our technique to accurately determine the kinematics of m31 dsph galaxies from small sample sizes .",
    "as and vi sits at a large projected distance from the centre of m31 ( @xmath672  kpc ) , it was not observed as part of the pandas survey and we were unable to use cfht data for our @xmath97 determination .",
    "instead , we use subaru suprime - cam data ( pi .",
    "n. arimoto , see @xcite for a full discussion of this data ) . using our full probabilistic analysis",
    ", we identify 45 stars with @xmath178 .",
    "our technique determines a most - likely @xmath673 , with @xmath674 . comparing these values with the results of @xcite who measured @xmath675 and @xmath676",
    ", we see that both the systemic velocities and the velocity dispersions are consistent within quoted uncertainties .",
    "the slight differences between our previous study and this work are simply a result of the application of our new technique .",
    "the kinematic properties for andromeda xi as measured from this deimos data set were first published in @xcite .",
    "here we identify 5 stars as probable members .",
    "we determine most - likely parameters of @xmath497 and @xmath677 .",
    "in @xcite we measured @xmath678 and we were unable to resolve the velocity dispersion for the dsph , measuring @xmath679 ( where the upper bound represents the formal 1@xmath171 uncertainty on the unresolved dispersion ) , which implied a higher systemic velocity and lower velocity dispersion for and xi .",
    "however , in that analysis , one star with a velocity of @xmath680 was considered to be an outlier based on its velocity , and thus excluded from the kinematic analysis . here , our algorithm gives this star a non - zero probability of membership , which likely decreases the systemic velocity and increases the dispersion .",
    "t12 also presented observations for and xi , but they were not able to cleanly detect the galaxy .",
    "they identified 2 stars with highly negative velocities ( @xmath681 ) , which are offset from our systemic velocity by @xmath682 .",
    "given the very negative velocities of their 2 stars , the probability of them both being m31 contaminants seems low , and some other explanation may be more suitable . between observations , there is one star common to both ( @xmath68300:46:19.10,@xmath684 + 33:48:4.1 ) , for which we measure a velocity of @xmath685 compared with @xmath686 .",
    "this amounts to a statistical difference at the level of @xmath687 .",
    "one obvious avenue to check is that there has been no velocity offset introduced by a rogue skyline that falls within the region of one of the three ca ii lines .",
    "we have carefully checked the spectra of each of our 5 probable members to see if this has been the case .",
    "we also rederive the velocity based on cross - correlations with each of the three lines individually , rather than with the full triplet .",
    "we find these results , and their average to be entirely consistent within the associated errors from the velocities derived using the technique discussed in ",
    "[ sect : specobs ] .",
    "this large discrepancy is puzzling , particularly as the methods used to measure velocities in this work are almost identical to those of t12 . without further data it is not possible for either team to pin down the exact issue , or which of the datasets gives the true systemic velocity .",
    "this argues for taking further observations within these faint systems , in the hopes of better understanding both the systems themselves , and any systematics introduced by the deimos instrument .",
    "it is comforting that , in all cases where this offset is observed , the velocity dispersions measured by each team are consistent with one another , suggesting the problem affects all observations identically .    in this case , we have identified a greater number of potential members stars than in the work of t12 , the spectra for all of which have relatively high s : n ( s : n@xmath688@xmath75 ) . therefore , our results should be considered as more robust than those of t12 .",
    "kinematic properties for andromeda xii as determined from the deimos data set presented here were previously published in @xcite and @xcite , and in both cases , membership was largely determined using hard cuts in velocity .",
    "this object has been of particular interest as it possesses an extremely negative systemic velocity with respect to andromeda , suggesting that it is on its first infall into the local group ( see @xcite for a full discussion ) .",
    "using our new algorithm , we measure @xmath689 and an unresolved velocity dispersion of @xmath690 , where the upper bound represents the formal @xmath4 uncertainty on the measurement . as",
    "the dispersion is unresolved , the lower error bound is undefined , as having a negative velocity dispersion is unphysical .",
    "these values are completely consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite ( @xmath691 and @xmath692 ) .",
    "t12 also presented observations for and xii , but as for and xi , they were not able to cleanly detect the galaxy .",
    "they identified 2 stars with highly negative velocities ( @xmath693 ) , which are offset from our systemic velocity by @xmath682 .",
    "in this instance , both the stars they observed overlap with two of our likely members , situated at @xmath134=00:47:28.63,@xmath694=+34:22:43.1 and @xmath68300:47:24.69,@xmath684 + 34:22:23.9 , and these velocities are offset from those that we measure at a statistical level of @xmath695 .",
    "this suggests that the self - same calibration effect that causes an offset between our results for and xi and those of t12 , is present here also . in the case of and",
    "xii , our mask was observed over two separate nights , giving us two velocity measurements for each star ( as discussed in @xcite and @xcite ) , and we saw no evidence for systematic offsets of this magnitude in the night to night velocities , making a calibration error within our dataset seem unlikely , though not impossible . we therefore conclude that , owing to our larger sample of members and repeat observations , our measurements for the kinematic properties of and xii are more robust than those of t12 .",
    "the kinematic properties of andromeda xiii were also presented in @xcite , and xiii sits at a large projected distance from andromeda @xmath696 kpc ) in the southern m31 halo , so we expect contamination from the milky way and andromeda halo to be low .",
    "it is surprising then , that we see significant structure within our deimos field .",
    "this is also seen within the 3 fields observed by t12 , who attribute this over - density of stars located at @xmath697 to an association with the triand over - density within the galactic halo .",
    "we too see a number of stars between @xmath698 and @xmath699 . from their positions within the cmd of and xiii",
    ", they appear more consistent with mw foreground k - dwarfs than m31 rgb stars . as such",
    ", these are also likely associated to this mw substructure .",
    "using our full probabilistic analysis , we identify the most probable and xiii stars as those 4 that cluster around @xmath700 , and we determine @xmath701 and are unable to resolve a velocity dispersion , with @xmath702 , where the upper limit indicates the formal @xmath4 uncertainty on the likelihood distribution . given the very large uncertainties on these values ( mostly a factor of the low number of member stars ) it comes as no surprise perhaps that these results are consistent with the results in @xcite ( @xmath703 and @xmath704 ) , although not with those of t12 ( @xmath705 and @xmath706 ) , where they derived parameters from three times the number of member stars that we present here .",
    "given the highly substructured nature of the and xiii field , and the fact that our detection is at a very low significance ( only 4 stars ) , we find that the t12 measurements for the kinematics of and xiii are more robust than ours ."
