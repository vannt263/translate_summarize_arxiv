    "nonlocal effects in superconducting mesoscopic systems have attracted a lot of interest in the recent decade in connection with investigations of novel coherent effects such as crossed andreev reflection ( car ) and elastic cotunneling ( ec ) @xcite , spin diffusion , injection , and accumulation @xcite that could have future practical applications in superconducting spintronics .",
    "modern superconducting electronic nanodevices often operate under out - of - equilibrium conditions because their sizes are comparable with relaxation lengths . complex biased circuits can contain josephson junctions in the resistive state , as well as normal - metal or ferromagnetic elements that are sources of nonequilibrium quasiparticles .",
    "one of the first nonlocal nonequilibrium effects was observed in a quite macroscopic josephson sns sandwich - type junction many years ago @xcite .",
    "the sns structure used had a thin s electrode with a thickness comparable with the charge imbalance length , @xmath0 , and was excited to the nonequilibrium state by quasiparticle injection .",
    "charge imbalance in superconductors was investigated in detail and attracted a lot of interest both in experimental and theoretical studies in the 1970s and 1980s .",
    "however , it was investigated mostly at temperatures close to the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the low - temperature range has been studied experimentally only recently @xcite and still has no appropriate theoretical description .",
    "while experiments with tunnel injection report on relaxation lengths of a few @xmath2 m , in agreement with older results close to @xmath1 , results for ohmic injection @xcite poorly correlate with previous results at high temperatures , where @xmath0 is determined only by the inelastic electron - phonon time @xcite . to measure the charge - imbalance length , authors of refs . and used normal - metal probes contacted to superconducting films directly or via a tunnel junction following the first works @xcite and recent spin injection experiments @xcite .",
    "another nonlocal detection method , proposed in @xcite , uses a josephson junction as a sensor of the injected nonequilibrium quasiparticles .",
    "this first `` nonlocal josephson effect '' was observed in sandwich - type sns structures also at temperatures very close to @xmath1 .",
    "an advantage of this method , which we also use in this work , is given by the possibility to measure directly the quasiparticle flow .",
    "moreover , this phenomenon furnishes the clue to a nonlocal control of josephson junctions in modern superconducting electronic nanodevices .    in this paper",
    ", we present the detection of a `` nonlocal critical current '' in mesoscopic sns ( al - cu - al ) josephson junctions with several spatially separated normal metal injectors ( cu ) connected to one of the superconducting al banks ( fig .",

    "was evaporated at a second angle in order to form all superconducting leads , so that all sn interfaces are assumed to be highly transparent .",
    "the injectors were realized as sloped narrow strips of a width of around 100 nm in order to avoid a josephson coupling between the left superconducting bank of the sns junction and the aluminum shadow parallel to the injectors ( see fig .  [ scheme ] ) .",
    "the investigated structures had nominally identical sns josephson junctions , characterized by the same distance _ _ l__=250 nm between superconducting electrodes , but had different distances _ d _ between the injectors and the sns junction .",
    "type - i samples ( fig . [ scheme ] ) had two injectors with _",
    "d _ equal to approximately 1.5 and 0.5 @xmath2 m , while for type - ii samples , these distances were 1.5 and 1.0 @xmath2 m .",
    "such a choice of the distance scale allows us to exclude coherent car and ec effects @xcite as well as the inverse proximity effect , because the distances were much larger than the al coherence length @xmath5130 nm @xcite . on the other hand , nonequilibrium phenomena , characterized by the charge - imbalance length ( @xmath6 m @xcite ) ,",
    "remain to be investigated with this choice of distances @xmath7 .",
    "all transport measurements in local and nonlocal configuration were performed using a standard four - terminal method in a shielded cryostat at temperatures down to 0.37 k. two stages of resistor - capacitor ( rc ) filters were incorporated into the measurement dc lines to eliminate electrical noise : a warm rc - filter stage was located at the top of the cryostat , while a cold rc - filter stage was mounted directly at the sample holder .",
