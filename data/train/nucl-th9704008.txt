    "measurements of strange and anti - strange particles in relativistic nuclear collisions have received much attention recently@xcite : ( anti-)strangeness enhancement relative to pp - data has been predicted as quark gluon plasma signal , because equilibrium yields of strange hadrons can not be achieved during the short collision time due to small @xmath11 cross sections@xcite .",
    "however , several thermal models have been applied@xcite to ( strange ) particle yields and used to extract the characteristic thermodynamic properties of the system ( a few macroscopic parameters ) from chemical equilibrium .    fig .",
    "[ fs160 ] shows such a calculation : different measured and calculated hadron ratios are shown as resulting from an equilibrium hadron gas at fixed temperature @xmath1 , quark chemical potential @xmath2 and strange quark chemical potential @xmath3 .",
    "the constituents of the hadron gas are all well - established hadrons up to masses of 2  gev ( coinciding with the list given in @xcite ) taken from@xcite .",
    "note that an isospin symmetric system is assumed ( as in the hadronization model ) : # ( protons)=#(nucleons)/2 , # ( @xmath12)=#(all pions)/3 etc .",
    "the system is treated as a mixture of relativistic , non - interacting bose ",
    "einstein and fermi  dirac gases with hagedorn s eigenvolume correction .    the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 of fig .",
    "[ fs160 ] are chosen in line with the values given by p.  braun - munzinger and j.  stachel in @xcite .",
    "agreement with many observed ratios from different experiments at the sps is achieved ( as in @xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath3 has been determined by the requirement that the total net - strangeness vanishes : @xmath13 .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 is the fraction of net - strangeness over net - baryon number ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "note that the presently calculated strange quark chemical potential @xmath16  mev is different from the value @xmath17  mev given in @xcite .",
    "for the ratios we gain roughly the same results , however , there is a discrepancy of about a factor of 2 in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 values .",
    "it should be mentioned that some of the measured ratios may deviate from the true , yet to be observed @xmath20-ratios : the @xmath21 ratio , which is a rather direct measure of the specific entropy @xmath22 in the fireball , has a value of @xmath23 .",
    "however , it is calculated from proton yields in the rapidity range 2.6 to 2.8 and pion yields in the range 3.2 to 4.8 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 ratio is measured for @xmath25  gev which excludes a major part of the momentum distributions .",
    "if one takes the value for a common @xmath26-cut ( @xmath27 for @xmath28  gev @xcite ) the ratio is compatible with the extracted temperatures and chemical potentials , since within the restricted phase space it is just the ratio of the fugacities times the degeneracies@xcite , which deviates considerably from the value for the full phase space .",
    "however , to allow for a consistent comparison to other models all experimental data are taken from the compilation in @xcite and we also give @xmath20 ratios for both presented models .    fig .",
    "[ fs160 ] shows the massive effect ( factors of @xmath29 ! ) of feeding on the predicted ratios ( cf .",
    "the discussion in @xcite ) : the crosses denote the ratios as predicted , if the contributions due to the decay of higher lying resonances ( e.g. @xmath30 , @xmath31 etc . ) are ignored .",
    "the circles show the ratios as obtained after one includes these feeding effects . in some cases",
    "both hadron species change considerably due to feeding , but sometimes such that the ratio does not change much , e.g. @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , @xmath34 denote the yields@xcite due to the decay of resonances ( e.g. @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .    collective motion and fits to particle spectra , respectively ,",
    "are not considered here .",
    "longitudinal and transverse flow velocities have already been extracted from particle spectra in combination with a static thermal model@xcite .",
    "however , it is questionable , whether thermal and chemical freeze - out happen simultaneously . here",
    ", we focus on a collective , _ chemical _ freeze - out .",
    "we now investigate , whether the reasonable agreement of data and model , as reached with the static equilibrium - plus - feeding model , can also be achieved with a dynamic model , which includes the formation and expansion of quark - gluon matter , a first order phase transition into coexistence of quark and hadron matter , and time - dependent evaporation of hadrons from the system , as it evolves with time through the phase transition .",
    "this means adopting a model for the hadronization and space - time evolution of quark matter droplets given in @xcite .",
    "a similar approach was given in @xcite , however , in terms of rate equations for the flavor kinetics .",
    "they allow the abundances of the different constituents of the system to be out of equilibrium , which is in contrast to our model .",
    "the calculated hadron yields in both models are similar , if the same initial input is used .",
    "the model @xcite assumes a first order phase transition of the qgp to hadron gas with gibbs conditions ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) for coexistence .",
    "the expansion and evaporation of the system takes into account equilibrium , as well as nonequilibrium features of the process :    1 .",
    "the plasma sphere is permanently surrounded by a layer of hadron gas , with which it stays in thermal and chemical equilibrium during the phase transition ( gibbs conditions ) .",
    "the strangeness degree of freedom stays in chemical equilibrium between the two phases ( however , @xmath41 for the individual phases ) .",
    "thus , the hadronic particle production is driven by the chemical potentials .",
    "the particle evaporation is incorporated by a time - dependent freeze - out of hadrons from the hadron phase surrounding the qgp droplet . during the expansion ,",
    "the volume increase of the system thus competes with the decrease due to the evaporative , time - dependent freeze  out .",
    "the global properties , like ( decreasing or increasing ) @xmath22 and @xmath14 of the remaining two - phase system , then change in time according to the following differential equations for the baryon number , the entropy , and the net strangeness number of the total system@xcite : @xmath42 for simplicity , we set @xmath43 , thus , @xmath44 is the effective ( ` universal ' ) rate of particles ( of converted hadron gas volume ) evaporated from the hadron phase .",
    "a more general treatment with differing rates for the three quantities is presently being studied@xcite .",
    "the equation of state consists of the bag model for the quark gluon plasma and the hadron gas of the previous section .",
    "thus , one solves simultaneously the ` non - equilibrium ' dynamics ( [ eq1 ] ) and the gibbs phase equilibrium conditions for the intrinsic variables , i.e. the chemical potentials and the temperature , as functions of time .",
    "the particle yields as functions of time have been calculated for different parameter sets : in fig .",
    "[ ratios45 ] the final ( time integrated ) ratios are plotted for a bag constant of @xmath45  mev , initial strangeness fraction @xmath46 and an initial specific entropy per baryon of @xmath47 .",
    "we choose an initial net - baryon number @xmath48 .",
    "obviously , the particle ratios will not depend on this choice .",
    "the theoretical ratios show an equally good overall agreement with the data points as the static fit .",
    "this scenario results in a rather rapid hadronization .",
    "the quasi - isentropic expansion of the system is due to those hadrons which are subsequently evaporated .",
    "decays and feeding occur after the hadrons leave the system .",
    "the specific entropy extracted with this fit is higher than the values given in @xcite for this beam energy ( @xmath49 ) , where entropy production was calculated in a one - dimensional hydrodynamic model of a heavy ion collision .",
    "the calculation of particle rates from a hadronizing qgp with @xmath45  mev has already been presented in @xcite , however , with @xmath50 .",
    "predictions have been also made for different conditions within the rate - equation approach of @xcite which yields much higher @xmath51 ratios .",
    "the system can cool within this model ( meaning the employed equations of state for both phases ) if @xmath52 @xcite , which can only be achieved for a low bag constant .",
    "low bag constants allow for the formation of metastable strange remnants of the plasma , the strangelets",
    ". however , the particle yields as resulting from such small @xmath53-values in the present model are not in good overall agreement with the observed ratios .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ b160 ] where a bag constant of @xmath54  mev and an initial specific entropy per baryon of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , is chosen .",
    "the results for the lower specific entropy are tolerable except for ratios where antibaryon yields are set in relation to baryon or meson yields .",
    "antibaryon to baryon ratios fail by more than one order of magnitude , which is due to the lower temperatures of the coexistence phase . to counteract this effect ,",
    "much higher initial specific entropies would be required . however , in particular the ratios @xmath21 and @xmath57 will then move away considerably from the experimentally observed values ( see fig .",
    "[ b160 ] ) .    note that within microscopic hadronic model calculations@xcite a pronounced dependence of antibaryon ( and even more so anti - cluster ) yields on the reaction volume has been predicted .",
    "this chemical non - equilibrium reflects the strong sensitivity of antibaryon production and absorption on the phase space evolution of the baryons .",
    "it is in contradiction to the volume freeze - out of thermal models . on the other hand ,",
    "even if equilibration of antibaryons is assumed , the abundances are predicted to be strongly enhanced in the case of an _ interacting _ hadron gas@xcite .",
    "[ mumu ] shows the time evolution of the system ( initial conditions as in fig .",
    "[ ratios45 ] ) in the plane of quark and strange quark chemical potential .",
    "the quark chemical potential is at the beginning of the evolution in the order of the temperature of the system .",
    "it is @xmath58  mev .",
    "this is twice the value assumed in the static approach , @xmath59  mev .",
    "however , in the course of the hadronization , the quark chemical potential drops to @xmath60  mev . on the other hand , the strange chemical potential increases from @xmath61 to values of @xmath62  mev at the end of the evolution , as compared to @xmath63  mev in the static fit .",
    "this is due to the strangeness distillation effect ( see below ) .",
    "[ muster235 ] shows the time evolution of the system in the @xmath2-@xmath1 plane in conjunction with the phase diagram of the quark gluon plasma phase and the hadron gas .",
    "the initial specific entropy of @xmath47 in combination with the bag constant @xmath45  mev leads to a fast decomposition of the quark phase within @xmath64  fm / c .",
    "the system moves on a path along the phase boundary . in our case",
    "we met the situation @xmath65 which leads to a reheating , i.e. @xmath66 increases with time@xcite , to a final value of @xmath67 . as a consequence the temperature also increases , but only slightly ( as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ muster235 ] ) . for",
    "@xmath54  mev the system cools , while the specific entropy of the quark drop decreases . in this case , the hadronization is incomplete and a strangelet of baryon number @xmath68 is formed .",
    "due to the strangeness distillery effect @xcite strange and antistrange quarks do not hadronize at the same time for a baryon - rich system : both the hadronic and the quark matter phases enter the strange sector , @xmath69 , of the phase diagram immediately .",
    "this is valid for both scenarios , the higher bag constant ( reheating ) as well as the lower bag constant ( cooling ) .",
    "the effect can be seen from the high values of the strangeness fraction in the quark phase , shown in fig .",
    "[ zafs ] for the higher bag constant @xmath45  mev . at the late stage of the evolution , as the strange chemical potential increases",
    ", the hadron phase reaches positive @xmath14 values as well .",
    "[ zafs ] shows also the charge to mass ratio of the two phases .    the rapid expansion of the system leads to changes of the chemical potentials which reflect on the differential hadron production rates .",
    "[ trate45 ] shows the particle rates @xmath70 for different hadrons as functions of time for the initial condition @xmath48 , @xmath47 , @xmath46 and a bag constant of @xmath45  mev ( as in fig .",
    "[ ratios45 ] ) .",
    "the particle rates decrease in general due to the shrinking of the system , since evaporation is proportional to the surface .",
    "however , the differences in the time dependences of different hadron rates are considerable : proton and deuteron rates drop very fast due to the decreasing quark chemical potential , while the antiproton rate even increases ( for the same reason ) . @xmath71 and @xmath72 production profits from the high strange quark chemical potential at the late stage of the evolution .",
    "[ logdmulti ] shows the time evolution of various particle ratios for the same calculation .",
    "most of the ratios  the final values of which are given in figs .",
    "[ ratios45 ]  change by factors @xmath73 in the course of the hadronization and evaporation .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamic parameters of a certain stage of the evolution , e.g. of the initial stage , can not be deduced from the final integrated particle ratios in the present model . for the bag constant of @xmath45",
    "mev the temperature stays rather constant ( which is not required by the model ) .",
    "therefore , ratios which do not depend directly on the chemical potentials , like @xmath74 and @xmath75 , do not change significantly .",
    "table  [ tab3 ] shows the absolute abundances of different hadron species for different initial conditions of the hadronizing quark - hadron system .",
    "we assume an initial baryon number of @xmath76 ( pb+pb ) . however , the final particle ratios do not depend on this , because the hadrons yields in this model scale with @xmath77 .",
    "thus one can easily re - normalize the model prediction for any system size , i.e. the number of participant nucleons .",
    "keep in mind that isospin symmetric systems are assumed . for @xmath45  mev the system hadronizes completely , while the specific entropy of the quark phase rises from @xmath78 ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) to @xmath81 , ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 ) . for @xmath54",
    "mev a cold strangelet of mass @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) or @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) emerges .",
    "the table shows that antibaryon yields are very sensitive to the bag constant , whereas the pions depend strongly on the initial specific entropy .",
    "the @xmath51 ratio from the dynamic hadronization and the favorable bag constant of @xmath45  mev turns out to be too high ( this is also a problem of the static fit ) . from the preliminary plots in @xcite",
    "one can read off a @xmath88 ratio of @xmath89@xmath90 for central pb+pb collisions ( @xmath20 yields ) , whereas the model yields a value of @xmath91 for the three choices of initial specific entropy .",
    "it is possible to improve this ratio by assuming a lower bag constant . for @xmath54  mev the model renders @xmath88 ratio of @xmath92 , as can be seen in table  [ tab3 ]",
    "it can be argued that the numbers of kaons and pions as the most abundant particles reflect the actual thermodynamic conditions much more accurately than other hadron species .",
    "[ hyper ] shows calculated multiplicities of various hypermatter clusters for @xmath45  mev , @xmath93 and @xmath55 .",
    "the penalty factor @xmath94 suppresses the abundances of heavy clusters during the hadronization process , which is reflected by the final yields : metastable hypermatter can only be produced with a probability @xmath9 for @xmath10 ( e.g. a \\{@xmath95 } object ) .",
    "can one discriminate the static thermal and the hadronizing source from observations of hadron abundances ?",
    "obviously , the final particle ratios are nearly identical and therefore not suitable for discriminating the two scenarios .",
    "the strong change in the time dependent particle rates ( fig .",
    "[ logdmulti ] ) reflects different average freeze - out times of the particle species .",
    "these , in turn , correspond to different average freeze - out radii , since the quark drop shrinks  in this scenario  during the hadronization process .",
    "both quantities , which characterize the size and the lifetime of the particle emitting source , are in principle accessible by means of hanbury - brown - twiss - analyses@xcite .",
    "this concept is used extensively for high energy heavy ion collisions ( for a review see @xcite ) .    in table",
    "[ tab2 ] the average freeze - out times of different hadron species resulting from a hadronizing qgp drop ( for different initial conditions ) are listed .",
    "only the directly produced hadrons are taken into account .",
    "the true freeze - out times are generally larger due to the finite lifetime of the resonances , which contribute to specific hadron yields .",
    "however , the two - particle correlations within the source  imposed by the quantum statistical momentum distributions  are lost through these decays .",
    "thus , the measured correlation function does not represent a simple fourier - like transform of the particle distribution inside the emitting source , if the contributions from resonance decays are dominant . as can be seen from table  [ tab2 ] only a fraction of the integrated , final yield of protons , kaons and pions",
    "are directly emitted from the hadronizing system .",
    "a major part stems from the decay of higher resonances .",
    "this makes the accessibility of the freeze - out radii or times by means of hbt analysis questionable .",
    "however , the presented results suggest that the observed freeze - out time will be smaller for @xmath96 than for @xmath71 , and it will also be smaller for @xmath97 and @xmath5 than for @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "the corresponding radii behave the opposite in this model , because the system shrinks .",
    "experimental particle ratios at sps energies are compatible with the scenario of a static thermal source in chemical equilibrium @xcite . a simple dynamic hadronization model , however , reproduces the numbers equally well .",
    "it yields the following conclusions : a high bag constant of @xmath100 is mandatory .",
    "these values of @xmath53 would exclude the existence of stable , cold strangelets , as hadronization proceeds without any cooling but with reheating .",
    "in central collisions of s+au(w , pb ) a specific entropy per baryon of @xmath101 is created .",
    "due to strangeness distillation the system moves rapidly out of the @xmath102 plane , into the @xmath3-sector .",
