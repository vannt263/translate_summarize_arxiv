    "since the realization of the @xmath5-wave superfluid state in @xmath6k and @xmath7li fermi gases , the possibility of @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas has attracted much attention both theoretically and experimentally@xcite . a tunable @xmath0-wave pairing interaction associated with a @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance",
    "has been realized in @xmath6k@xcite and @xmath7li@xcite fermi gases .",
    "it has been also observed in a @xmath6k fermi gas that a magnetic dipole - dipole interaction lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath0-wave feshbach resonance , leading to different resonance magnetic fields between the @xmath3-component and the other @xmath8 and @xmath9 components , under an external magnetic field applied in the @xmath10-direction@xcite .",
    "this split naturally leads to the anisotropy of the three @xmath0-wave interaction channels as @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the interaction strength in the @xmath13-channel ) . in this case",
    ", a phase transition from the @xmath3-wave pairing state to the @xmath4-wave one has been theoretically predicted@xcite . since such",
    "a phase transition never occurs in the case of @xmath5-wave superfluid , the realization of the @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas would be useful for the study of a phase transition between different pairing states , from the weak - coupling regime to the strong - coupling limit in a unified manner .",
    "pairing fluctuations are usually suppressed in the superfluid phase , because of the opening of single - particle excitation gap .",
    "however , in the present case , even in the @xmath3-wave superfluid phase below @xmath1 , pairing fluctuations in the @xmath4-channel would become strong near @xmath2 , especially in the intermediate coupling regime .",
    "thus , the @xmath0-wave superfluid fermi gas is also an interesting system to study strong pairing fluctuations appearing in the superfluid phase .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the phase transition between the @xmath3-wave state and @xmath4-wave state in a superfluid fermi gas with a @xmath0-wave pairing interaction .",
    "so far , this problem has been examined within the ginzburg - landau theory@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we employ a fully microscopic approach , including strong - coupling effects within the gaussian fluctuation approximation@xcite .",
    "we determine the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath1 , as well as the transition temperature @xmath2 from the @xmath3-wave state to @xmath4-wave state below @xmath1 .",
    "we consider a one - component fermi gas with a @xmath0-wave pairing interaction , described by the hamiltonian @xmath14 here , @xmath15 is the creation operator of a fermi atom with the kinetic energy @xmath16 , measured from the chemical potential @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are the three components of an assumed @xmath0-wave pairing interaction@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we ignore detailed feshbach mechanism , and simply treat @xmath20 as a tunable parameter .",
    "however , we include the anisotropy of the interaction by the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "that is , assuming that an external magnetic field is applied in the @xmath10-direction , we set @xmath21@xcite .    the strength of the @xmath0-wave interaction is conveniently measured in terms of the scattering volume @xmath22 ( @xmath19 ) and the effective range @xmath23 , that are given by , respectively , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a momentum cutoff .",
    "we also introduce the anisotropy parameter , @xmath26 .",
    "we include pairing fluctuations in the @xmath0-wave cooper channel within the gaussian fluctuation theory . in this strong - coupling theory , the thermodynamic potential @xmath27 consists of the mean field part @xmath28 and the fluctuation part @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath28 is given by @xmath30 -\\frac{1}{\\beta}\\sum_{\\bf p } \\ln\\left[1 + e^{-\\beta e_{p } } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath31 is the @xmath0-wave superfluid order parameter , and @xmath32 describes bogoliubov single - particle excitations . the fluctuation part , @xmath29 , is diagrammatically given in fig.[fig1 ] . summing up these diagrams",
    ", one has @xmath33 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "@xmath37 is the correlation function , having the form , @xmath38 , \\\\",

    "since we are taking @xmath21 , the superfluid phase transition first occurs in the @xmath3-wave cooper channel .",
    "thus , the equation for the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath1 is given by setting @xmath49 and @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ gapp ] ) , as @xmath51 we solve this equation , together with the number equation ( [ num ] ) with @xmath52 , to determine @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ figvp ] shows @xmath1 as a function of the interaction strength . in this figure , the increase of the inverse scattering volume @xmath53 corresponds to the increase of the interaction strength .",
    "starting from the weak - coupling regime , @xmath1 gradually increases with increasing the strength of the pairing interaction , and it approaches a constant value when @xmath54 .",
    "apart from the values of @xmath1 , the overall behavior of @xmath1 is close to the @xmath5-wave case .    in the weak - coupling regime ,",
    "[ figvp ] shows that the anisotropy of the pairing interaction ( which is described by the anisotropy parameter @xmath55 ) is not crucial for @xmath1 . in this regard , we note that , since the @xmath1 equation ( [ tc ] ) does not explicitly involve @xmath56 nor @xmath57 , they only affect @xmath1 through the fermi chemical potential @xmath17 determined by the number equation ( [ num ] ) .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath17 is actually close to the fermi energy in the weak - coupling regime because of weak pairing fluctuations .",
    "thus , the superfluid phase transition in this regime is only dominated by @xmath58 ( or @xmath59 ) , so that @xmath1 is insensitive to @xmath55 .",
    "the anisotropy of the @xmath0-wave pairing interaction gradually becomes important , as one goes away from the weak - coupling regime . to understand this , it is convenient to consider the strong coupling limit . in this extreme case , the system may be viewed as a bose gas , consisting of three kinds of tightly bound molecules that are formed by @xmath58 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 pairing interactions .",
    "@xmath1 is then dominated by the bose - einstein condensation of one of the three components having the largest number @xmath60 of bose molecules . while @xmath61 in the isotropic case ( where @xmath47 is the number of the fermi atoms ) , @xmath60 approaches @xmath62 with increasing the magnitude of @xmath58 compared with the other two interactions .",
    "since the bec phase transition temperature of an ideal bose gas is proportional to @xmath63 , @xmath1 increases with increasing the anisotropy parameter @xmath55 .",
    "although the @xmath3-wave superfluid phase is realized near @xmath1 , this pairing symmetry changes into the @xmath4-wave at a certain temperature ( @xmath64 ) below @xmath1 , as shown in fig.[figvp ] . while @xmath1 is larger for a larger value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath65 , @xmath2 for @xmath66",
    "is found to be lower than that for @xmath67 . to see this more clearly",
    ", we show the @xmath68-dependence of @xmath2 in fig.[figvpd ] .",
    "when the @xmath0-wave interaction is very anisotropic ( @xmath69 ) , the @xmath3-wave pairing becomes more and more favorable , so that the @xmath4-wave state is suppressed .",
    "although it is difficult to examine the region far below @xmath1 based on the present strong - coupling theory because of computational problems , we briefly note that a critical value of @xmath65 at which @xmath2 vanishes can be obtained within the mean field theory .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated the superfluid properties of a one - component fermi gas with an anisotropic @xmath0-wave interaction . within the framework of the gaussian fluctuation theory",
    ", we determined the superfluid transition temperature @xmath1 , as well as the phase transition temperature @xmath2 from the @xmath3-wave pairing state to the @xmath4-wave state .",
    "while the anisotropy of the @xmath0-wave pairing interaction ( @xmath21 ) is not crucial for @xmath1 in the weak - coupling regime , we showed that this anisotropy enhances @xmath1 in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "we also showed that , in contrast to the case of @xmath1 , the anisotropy of the pairing interaction suppresses @xmath2 .",
