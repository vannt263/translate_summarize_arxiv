    "* ) , the _ xmm - newton _  2006 and _ swift_spectra require additional components . we used a partial covering absorber model with an underlying power law and broken power law spectral models . table[xray_res ] summarizes the results from the x - ray spectral analysis .",

    "the most dramatic change is from the 2006 _ xmm - newton _  to the first _",
    "swift_observation when the absorber became nearly opaque and only 2% of the x - ray emission can be seen directly . in this case",
    "the absorption column density changes from @xmath21 @xmath1 with a covering fraction of 0.45 during the 2006 _ xmm - newton _  observation to about @xmath22 @xmath1 and a covering fraction of 0.98 during the first swift observation .",
    "we fitted all three _ swift _  spectra simultaneously in xspec by tying the covering fraction @xmath2 and spectral indices together .",
    "this fit suggests a change in the absorption column density @xmath23 of the partial covering absorber by a factor of 2 within a week between the 2007 may 17 and 25 observations .",
    "alternatively , we also fitted the spectra with @xmath23 tied and @xmath2 left as a free parameter .",
    "an f - test gives an f - value of 7.8 that these two fits are different and a probability p=0.006 of a random result .",
    "leaving @xmath23 free gives a significantly better result than leaving @xmath2 free to vary . in the rest - frame 0.2 - 2.0 kev band the observed fluxes ( only corrected for galactic absorption ) seem to be highly variable and between the _ xmm - newton _",
    "2000 and the first _ swift _  observation we found variability by a factor of 30 .",
    "however , when correcting also for intrinsic absorption the unabsorbed restframe 0.2 - 2.0 kev fluxes from rosat to swift are comparable . during the rosat all - sky survey observation a flux of 4@xmath24 w m@xmath25 was found @xcite . correcting for a partial covering absorber in the _ xmm - newton _  and _ swift _  spectra we found that the flux varied only by factors of 4 - 6 as listed in table[xray_res ] .",
    "the x - ray spectra of mkn 335 in the higher and more typical flux state can be well described as arising from an incident power law and reflection component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "however , the low - flux spectra are difficult to reproduce by simply rescaling the high - state models or by varying the relative contribution of each component .",
    "a modified reflection model , which self - consistently describes the high- and low - flux states is being investigated and is presented in gallo et al .",

    "as shown by the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) in figure[mkn335_sed ] there was no dramatic variability in the uv data between the 2000 _ xmm - newton _  om and 2007 _ swift _  uvot observations , although during the 2007 may 17th observation mkn 335 was about 0.2 mag fainter .",
    "the uv / optical spectral slopes are on the order of @xmath26 , except for the 2007 may 17 observation when it was @xmath27 .",
    "the uv to x - ray spectral slope @xmath28=0.384 log(@xmath29 ) .",
    "] was significantly steeper during the _ swift _",
    "observations with @xmath28=1.91 and 1.65 during the _ swift _  segments 001 and 002 , respectively . during the 2000 _ xmm - newton _  observation ,",
    "however , an @xmath28=1.32 was measured , consistent with the value given by @xcite .",
    "we reported the _ swift _  observations of the nls1 mkn 335 when it was in its lowest x - ray flux state ever observed .",
    "historically , mkn 335 has exhibited x - ray variability by about a factor of a few ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although the source has always remained rather bright at least until the last x - ray observation with _ suzaku _ in 2006 june ( j. larsson , 2007 priv .",
    "however , sometime between 2006 june and 2007 may the observed flux dropped by a factor of more than 30 including a dramatic change in its sed .",
    "the x - ray spectrum has become progressively more complex as the x - ray flux has diminished , indicative of either absorption or reflection ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the 2 - 10 kev high - flux spectrum in 2000 did not appear overly complex and the high - energy continuum could be simply fitted with a power law .",
    "the 2006 _ xmm - newton _  data , however , can be fitted with a partial covering absorber model ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that the absorber started moving in the line of sight before 2006 january .",
    "partial covering of the central light source has been invoked since the early days of agn x - ray spectroscopy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and quite often to describe the x - ray spectrum of nls1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "its presence is also indicated by narrow absorption lines ( which appear to be saturated but do not reach zero intensity ) in uv spectra of broad absorption line ( bal ) quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the geometry and physics of partial coverers are still not well understood .",
    "one possible geometry consists of thick blobs of gas , partially covering parts of the accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of mkn 335",
    ", the clouds must cover only the inner parts of the disk , since we find that the uv emission is not highly variable between the _ xmm - newton _  observation in 2000 and the _ swift _  observations in 2007 , while the x - rays vary dramatically .",
    "note that the fits to the may 17 and may 25 swift spectra suggest a change in the partial covering absorber column densities by a factor of about 2 .",
    "this timescale is consistent with e.g. the absorber toy model suggested by @xcite , where thick clouds at 10 - 100 schwarzschild radii partially obcure the central region and causing the x - ray variability .    alternatively ,",
    "a partial covering situation may arise if our line - of - sight passes through an accretion - disk driven wind which is launched at intermediate disk radii ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if such a wind varies with time and/or is inhomogeneous , different parts of the central source would be covered at different times . in both partial covering geometries ,",
    "the physics is still uncertain . in the case of dense blobs : how are they confined and what is their origin ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in case of disk - driven winds",
    ": what is the driver of these massive outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the high column density we need in our swift spectral fits is similar to those frequently observed in bal quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this context",
    ", it is interesting to note that similarities between nls1 galaxies and bal quasars have been pointed out repeatedly ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in one specific case , that of the x - ray transient nls1 galaxy wpvs 007 , the onset of heavy x - ray absorption @xcite is indeed accompanied by the onset of uv bals @xcite . when correcting for the effects of intrinsic absorption we found that the x - ray flux of mkn 335 originating from the central engine has been very similar in the rest - frame 0.2 - 2.0 kev band between the rosat observations and the most recent _ swift_observations . using these fluxes , the intrinsic variability is only a factor of about 4 - 6 , which is quite normal for an agn , in particular for a nls1 .",
    "the change in intrinsic flux between the first and second swift observations is about a factor of 3 within a week .",
    "if a partial covering absorber is the correct model this flux change implies that the soft x - ray scattering region can only be a few light days in diameter which is consistent with the @xcite toy model .",
    "the deep low - state of mkn 335 discovered with _ swift_provides us with a rare chance to scrutinize the properties of x - ray low - state agn in general .",
    "mkn 335 is unique with respect to being relatively bright during its low - state .",
    "therefore , follow - up observations of mkn 335 in its current low - state are highly encouraged",
    ". we will continue our monitoring with _ swift _  in order to find the timescales on which the agn switches from a low to high state , but also deep _ xmm - newton _  observations , optical spectrocsopy and spectropolarimetry are needed to clarify the nature of the current low - state .",
    "we want to thank paul obrien and our referee for useful comments on the manuscript .",
    "we also want to thank the _ swift _  pi neil gehrels for approving our too request and the _ swift _  science planners mike stroh and sally hunsberger for fitting the observations into the _ swift_schedule .",
    "we acknowledge the use of public data from the _ xmm - newton _  and swift data archives . this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration .",
