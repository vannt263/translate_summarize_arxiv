    "the @xmath7 decay into @xmath8 is an example of isospin violation , since the @xmath7 has isospin @xmath9 and spin @xmath10 , and it would not couple to @xmath8 in the isospin limit , which requires @xmath11 ( the decay into @xmath12 is forbidden in any case because the particles are identical ) .",
    "in addition , it violates the ozi rule @xcite and hence it is subleading in the large @xmath13 @xcite expansion .",
    "the experimental situation on this decay is rather confusing .",
    "there are two old results : @xmath14 from @xcite , and @xmath15 @xcite , with very different central values but whose errors are so big to make them compatible .",
    "very recently , two new , more precise , but conflicting results have been reported from the two experiments at the vepp-2 m in novosibirsk : the cmd-2 collaboration reports @xmath16 @xcite whereas the snd collaboration @xcite obtains @xmath17 .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "the common ground is based on the @xmath3 mixing @xcite to account for the strong part of the decay . in addition , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been pointed out that the two - step @xmath18 transition mixing .",
    "we will consider such resonant processs as the one that provides , by resonance saturation , the complementary local terms to the kaon loop contributions to @xmath3 mixing that we will calculate later on .",
    "] can give a relevant contribution and that other non - resonant processes , as a possible bare @xmath19 coupling , have to be considered in detail .",
    "it is remarkable , in contrast with the ozi allowed @xmath20 decay , that the electromagnetic @xmath21 coupling via photon exchange @xmath22 provides the right order of magnitude @xcite .    within chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) @xcite ,",
    "isospin breaking has recently gained interest , since it is possible to take systematically into account the corrections due to the different @xmath23 and @xmath24 quark masses and to electromagnetic effects .",
    "examples of such calculations are @xmath25 scattering @xcite , some @xmath26 amplitudes and the nucleon self - energy @xcite , nn scattering @xcite and the pionium atom @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , isospin violation in @xmath4 lies far away from the chpt applicability range , since it involves the propagation of the pair of mesons around 1 gev .",
    "nevertheless , new nonperturbative schemes imposing unitarity and still using the chpt lagrangian have emerged enlarging the convergence of the chiral expansion @xcite , for a review see ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we shall follow the work @xcite , since it provides the most comprehensive study of the different meson - meson scattering channels , including resonances up to 1.2 gev .",
    "in particular , this method yields a resonance in the @xmath27 channel , which is related to the @xmath7 and thus will allow us to obtain an important contribution to @xmath4 due to the charged and neutral meson mass difference .",
    "we shall also consider electromagnetic contributions at tree level as well as the contribution due to the @xmath6 mixing .",
    "these three contributions can have different kinds of cancellations among themselves , depending on the @xmath6 mixing scenario .",
    "some other theoretical uncertainties in our approach are unavoidable since the results are rather sensitive to the @xmath28 coefficients of the @xmath29 chpt lagrangian and to the value of @xmath30 , which measures the coupling of a vector resonance with a photon .",
    "we will not calculate the electromagnetic loop corrections since the present ignorance of higher order counterterms makes their calculation unfeasible . however , from refs .",
    "@xcite one expects the meson  photon intermediate states to yield a contribution of , at most , 25@xmath31 of that of kaon loops .",
    "in order to calculate the contribution of an intermediate photon to @xmath4 , we will use the vector meson chiral effective lagrangian presented in @xcite , which is written in terms of the su(3 ) pseudoscalar meson matrix @xmath7 and the antisymmetric vector tensor field @xmath32 defined as @xmath33 the latter is normalized such that @xmath34 , \\label{norm}\\ ] ] with @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 the mass , momentum , and polarization vector of the vector field @xmath38 . following @xcite ,",
    "let us then consider the lagrangian @xmath39=\\frac{f_v}{2\\sqrt{2 } } \\langle v_{\\mu\\nu}f_+^{\\mu\\nu}\\rangle+ \\frac{i\\,g_v}{\\sqrt{2}}\\langle v_{\\mu\\nu}u^\\mu u^\\nu\\rangle , \\label{lag}\\ ] ] where ",

    ", @xmath45 is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit ( we take @xmath46 mev ) and the @xmath47 and @xmath48 tensors are defined as @xmath49    in order to introduce the @xmath7 and @xmath50 states , we extend su(3 ) to u(3 ) and substitute @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the diagonal @xmath53 matrix and @xmath54 is the lightest singlet vector resonance .",
    "hence , by imposing ideal mixing between @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xmath56 unless otherwise stated , in the following we will refer to these states simply as @xmath50 and @xmath7 , although it should be kept in mind that we are referring to their respective ideal states .",
    "finally , the @xmath7 and @xmath50 can be introduced into the chiral notation by replacing in eq.([lag ] ) the @xmath32 tensor by @xmath57    the convention of signs of eq.([defs ] ) agrees with a more standard one if we take @xmath58 negative in all the lagrangians , as we shall do in what follows .",
    "the vertex function @xmath59 , resulting from eq.([lag ] ) , is @xmath60 and to the same order than eq.([lphigamma ] ) the lagrangian giving the coupling of the photon to the pions is @xmath61    with these ingredients we can write the contribution of the feynman diagram of fig.1 , which is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the pion electromagnetic form factor , which at the @xmath7 mass is given by @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "this can be compared with the coupling of the @xmath7 to @xmath65 , or @xmath66 , which can be obtained from the @xmath67 term in eq.([lag ] ) and reads @xmath68 the @xmath69 width is then given by @xmath70 which , using its experimental value @xcite , provides @xmath71 mev ( to compare with @xmath72 , from the study of the pion em radius @xcite ) .    by analogy to eq.([lphikk ] ) , eq.([lphipipi ] ) provides a @xmath21 coupling @xmath73 and eq.([gphikk ] ) , substituting @xmath74 by @xmath75 and @xmath76 by @xmath77 , provides the tree level electromagnetic contribution to the @xmath78 decay width . with",
    "a value of @xmath79 mev from the @xmath80 decay @xcite this contribution alone would yield @xmath81 , a value compatible with the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , within errors .",
    "it may seem surprising that @xmath82 already provides the correct order of magnitude of the @xmath78 decay , since , in contrast , it is well known @xcite that the tree level photon contribution @xmath83 , represents a negligible amount of the @xmath84 .",
    "however , the case of the @xmath50 is radically different from ours and can be well understood from @xmath85 mixing .",
    "we will now calculate this effect making use of an effective chiral lagrangian and large @xmath13 arguments @xcite .",
    "indeed , from this reference , the @xmath85 mixing can be represented as @xmath86 with @xmath87.\\ ] ] note that @xmath88 is the mass of the vector octet in the chiral limit @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "we have also made use in eq .",
    "( [ urech ] ) of eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) , thus turning to the usual vector notation . at lowest order in chpt @xcite the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ tecta ] ) arise from the quark mass difference , and the third one is of electromagnetic origin from the exchange of a photon between the @xmath90 and the @xmath50 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the electromagnetic contribution only amounts to a 14@xmath31 of that due to quark mass differences .",
    "contrary to the @xmath7 case , the @xmath85 mixing is ozi allowed and leading in large @xmath13 , as can be seen from eqs .",
    "( [ urech ] ) and ( [ tecta ] ) .",
    "in fact , this term is of the same order than the free lagrangian , both in the @xmath91 and in chiral countings ( this is more clearly seen in the tensor notation ) .",
    "in addition , there is a kaon loop contribution , fig.2 , which , from chpt , is expected to be of the same order of magnitude than the electromagnetic contribution . evaluating the diagram of fig.2 one",
    "has : @xmath92.\\ ] ] where , once again , we have used eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) to present our results in the vector notation .",
    "the @xmath93 loop function , in the usual chpt @xmath94 scheme , is :    @xmath95 \\nonumber \\\\ \\sigma&= & \\sqrt{1-\\frac{4 m^2}{s}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath96 is the dimensional regularization scale . in order to estimate the eq .",
    "( [ loopkaon ] ) contribution at @xmath97 , we use the natural value @xmath98 .",
    "the results depend on the regularization scale but they provide a good estimate of the order of magnitude , as we shall see later on , when we will reevaluate this contribution within the chiral unitary approach .    at this point",
    "we are ready to compare all contributions :    0.3 cm    [ cols=\"<,^ , > \" , ]     0.3 cm    hence , the @xmath85 mixing is dominated by the ozi allowed strong contribution due to quark mass differences , which is leading both in the large @xmath13 and chiral countings .",
    "in addition , the kaon loops are smaller than the electromagnetic contribution although with a large destructive interference between them ( for @xmath99 mev , which is the value needed to reproduce @xmath100 from eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) , the estimate of the kaon loop contribution would be @xmath101190 mev@xmath102 ) .",
    "we will find again this large destructive interference between the kaon loops and the electromagnetic contribution when considering the @xmath7 resonance .    in summary",
    ", the fact that the purely electromagnetic contribution already provides a reasonable order of magnitude for the @xmath4 decay , is due to the absence of the ozi allowed contribution , which makes the @xmath103 decay comparatively much larger .",
    "note that such contribution is missing in the ozi violating , large @xmath13 subleading , @xmath3 mixing .",
    "the fact that @xmath103 is much larger than the @xmath4 dominant contribution is very relevant since , through the @xmath6 mixing , it provides an additional mechanism that has to be taken into account in the complete calculation of @xmath4 , and that we analyze next .      as a matter of fact , the physical @xmath7 and @xmath50 states",
    "are not the ideal ones defined in eq.([mixing ] ) , but instead @xmath104 in the literature there is a general agreement on @xmath105 , but , apart from conventions , not on its sign @xcite . its contribution to the @xmath21 effective coupling",
    "is obtained from fig.3 as follows : @xmath106 we have already obtained @xmath107 , although here it has to be evaluated at @xmath108 .",
    "still , the dominant contribution comes from the quark mass differences .",
    "the kaon loop contribution can not be calculated using eq.([loopkaon ] ) , since that formula is not unitary .",
    "we will see later , how this number can be obtained from the chiral unitary approach , and again it is of the order of @xmath109 , and therefore numerically irrelevant for the following discussion .",
    "the new @xmath110 parameter can be obtained from the literature .",
    "nevertheless , its imaginary part can be obtained from unitarity .",
    "the most relevant intermediate states are @xmath111 and three pions . in the first case the couplings to @xmath7 and @xmath50 are completely determined by the vector resonance lagrangian . however , the imaginary part contribution of three pion intermediate states has some model dependence @xcite , mostly through the @xmath112 coupling .",
    "we consider now two different scenarios for the @xmath6 mixing which illustrates to some extent the uncertainties that are found in the literature with respect to this issue :    * `` weak mixing '' scenario @xcite , where @xmath113 and @xmath114 . * `` strong mixing '' scenario @xcite , where @xmath115 to @xmath116 and @xmath117 .    which will therefore appear as different cases in our final result .    up to now",
    "we have just concentrated on the tree level diagrams of the @xmath21 decay .",
    "there are , however , important contributions from kaon loops that we will analyze in the next sections , whose calculation is the main novelty of this work .",
    "the pure strong interaction chiral lagrangian gives a contribution to the @xmath78 decay if the charged and neutral meson masses are different , otherwise it would be forbidden .    for instance , from eqs.([lag ] ) and ( [ vtilde ] ) there is no direct @xmath118 coupling .",
    "however , we can generate a non vanishing @xmath78 transition when keeping different masses for the charged and neutral kaons in the loops of fig.4 , which do not violate the ozi rule , although they are subleading in large @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , these diagrams are expected to give the main strong interaction contribution to @xmath119 due to intermediate states . for instance , the @xmath7 couples much more strongly to @xmath111 than to @xmath120 , as it is clear from the fact that @xmath121 , although three pions are kinematically much more favored than two kaons .    note that in the evaluation of the diagrams of fig.4 the @xmath122 amplitude can receive important contributions from the @xmath50 or @xmath90 exchange . in the first case , the @xmath50 couples to the @xmath90 once again , and therefore is included in the @xmath18 mixing contributions .",
    "thus , in the following we will concentrate on the evaluation of these kaon - loop contributions to the direct @xmath3 mixing , that is , we will consider only the exchange of the @xmath90 in the @xmath123 @xmath9 p - wave amplitudes appearing on fig.4 .    an estimation of the imaginary part of this contribution to the diagrams in fig.4 is straightforward using the vector meson chiral lagrangian .",
    "the sum of the diagrams does not vanish due to the different masses of the charged and neutral kaons .",
    "the @xmath119 branching ratio that would be obtained taking into account just this contribution is already of the order of magnitude of the experimental results , given the large uncertainty on the data .",
    "yet , this estimate does not take into account corrections to @xmath2 due to isospin violation .",
    "in addition , the real part of the loop remains ambiguous since it requires the knowledge of higher order contributions than those given by eq.([lag ] ) , that is , counterterms to absorb loop divergences .",
    "furthermore , even when we have such counterterms , the chiral expansion is only expected to work at energies which are below the @xmath7 mass .",
    "we present here a method which deals simultaneously with all these problems in order to extract the aforementioned kaon loop contributions .",
    "the method exploits the information of chpt up @xmath124 , by relying on the expansion of the @xmath125-matrix .",
    "the technique starts from the @xmath126 and @xmath29 chpt lagrangian and uses the inverse amplitude method ( iam ) in coupled channels .",
    "unitarity provides for free the imaginary part of @xmath125 , and then a chiral expansion is done for re@xmath127 , which , in the present case , has a larger radius of convergence than @xmath128 itself .",
    "this approach has been applied in the isospin limit with remarkable results : with just one channel @xcite it nicely describes the @xmath129 , @xmath90 and @xmath130 regions , amongst others , in @xmath131 and @xmath132 scattering .",
    "when generalized to coupled channels @xcite it also describes meson - meson scattering with all the associated resonances up to about 1.2 gev .",
    "a more general approach is used in @xcite by means of the n / d method , in order to include the exchange of some preexisting resonances explicitly , which are then responsible for the values of the fourth order chiral parameters",
    ".    the @xmath128 amplitude is defined in terms of the partial waves as @xmath133 in what follows we will refer to @xmath134 simply as @xmath128 . within the coupled channel formalism , the iam partial wave amplitude is given by the matrix equation @xmath135^{-1}\\,t_2 , \\label{iam}\\ ] ] where @xmath136 and @xmath137 are @xmath126 and @xmath29 chpt partial waves , respectively . in principle",
    ", @xmath137 would require a full one - loop calculation , but it was shown in @xcite that , at the phenomenological level , it can be well approximated by @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the tree level polynomial contribution coming from the @xmath140 chiral lagrangian and @xmath141 is a diagonal matrix @xmath142 , where @xmath143 is the loop function of the intermediate two meson propagators , which we give in the appendix . in @xcite",
    "the loop integrals are regularized by means of a momentum cut - off , @xmath144 , in the loop three - momentum .",
    "the relation between this cut - off and the dimensional regularization scale @xmath96 , normally used in chpt , is also given in that paper .",
    "we have also taken advantage to correct a small error detected in @xcite in the @xmath145 amplitude , whose complete expression in the isospin limit is given in the appendix .",
    "we have also reconducted a fit to the data including those on ( @xmath146 , which are well determined from @xcite .",
    "the fit of the phase shifts and inelasticities is carried out here in the isospin limit , as done in @xcite .",
    "there are several sets of @xmath28 coefficients which give rise to equally acceptable fits .",
    "as it can be seen in fig.5 , there are several plots for which there are incompatible sets of data .",
    "this is particularly evident for the @xmath147 data both in @xmath148 and @xmath149 , in the inelasticity @xmath150 , and in the @xmath151 phase shifts . as a consequence , although we have performed a @xmath152 fit of the data using minuit @xcite , the resulting @xmath152 per degree of freedom is not really very meaningful , since the @xmath28 values depend on the estimate of the systematic error of each experiment , which is not given in many original references .",
    "in addition , due to the fact that we have eight parameters , there are several @xmath152 minima , which yield very similar values of @xmath152 for rather different values of some chiral parameters .",
    "which one is the real minimum depends on how we add the systematics . for that reason we have preferred to give several sets of coefficients , which yield @xmath153 when assuming a 3% systematic error added in quadrature to the statistical error quoted by each experiment .",
    "we write in table 1 the different sets of chiral parameters and we show their corresponding results for the phase shifts and inelasticities in fig.5 .",
    "we can see that the small differences in the results appear basically only in the @xmath154 and @xmath155 resonance regions , where data have also larger errors or are very scarce .    although the tadpoles and loop terms in the crossed channels were neglected and reabsorbed into @xmath28 redefinitions @xcite when we use eq.([ret4 ] ) , these coefficients are still close to those of standard chpt ( see table i ) .",
    "consequently , it seems that this simplifying approximation has a small effect in the relevant energy region , not spoiling also the standard low energy chpt results .",
    "one of the side consequences of the approach was the generation of a resonance around 1 gev in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 channel , which only couples to @xmath149 .",
    "actually , it has a zero width , since its mass is below the @xmath156 threshold .",
    "one is tempted to associate this state to the @xmath7 meson , however , we can only relate it with the octet part @xmath55 , which , by mixing with a singlet generates the @xmath7 and the @xmath50 .",
    "this can be easily understood since the singlet in this channel , @xmath54 , which is symmetric in the su(3 ) representation , does not couple to two mesons because their spatial wave function is antisymmetric . since",
    "only two meson states were considered in @xcite , @xmath54 does not appear in the iam , and the resonant state found in that channel can only be related to @xmath55 .",
    "however , we will see next that we can still exploit the properties of the @xmath157 pole in order to study the decays of the @xmath7 resonance .",
    "let us then turn to the case of interest for this work : the evaluation of the @xmath10 @xmath158 and @xmath122 amplitudes around the mass of the @xmath55 .",
    "now we are breaking isospin explicitly by keeping different the charged and neutral meson masses , while keeping the @xmath28 obtained from the previous fits to meson - meson scattering in the isospin limit .",
    "in addition , we are dealing with three two - meson states : @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath8 , that we will call 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the amplitude is a @xmath161 matrix whose elements we will denote as @xmath162 ( for instance , @xmath163 stands for the @xmath10 @xmath164 amplitude ) .",
    "the @xmath136 and @xmath139 amplitudes used in the present work and calculated in the isospin breaking case , are collected in the appendix .",
    "once the amplitudes are unitarized with the iam , one observes the presence of two poles , one corresponding to the @xmath165 and the other one to the @xmath157 resonance .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath157 pole appears with a mass around 910 mev , very close to the value 930 mev predicted by the quadratic or linear @xmath166 mass formulae @xcite for the @xmath157 mass . in the following",
    ", we will denote by @xmath167 the resonance pole that we have obtained in our approach corresponding to the @xmath157 resonance .",
    "the motivation for this change of notation is the lack of the @xmath120 state in our model since this contribution can be particularly relevant in order to study certain properties of the @xmath157 resonance .",
    "for instance , the @xmath168 couplings of the @xmath157 and @xmath169 according to eq .",
    "( [ mixing ] ) add for the @xmath50 giving rise to the @xmath170 coupling and almost cancel each other in the case of the @xmath7 , @xmath171 .    in order to evaluate the kaon loop contribution to the @xmath172 coupling via direct @xmath3 mixing , we first study the @xmath173 coupling .",
    "we thus evaluate the @xmath174 amplitude ( @xmath175 ) and the @xmath176 amplitude ( @xmath163 ) near the pole of the @xmath167 resonance .",
    "close to the @xmath167 pole the amplitudes obtained numerically are then dominated by the exchange of this resonance , represented diagrammatically in fig 6 .    by considering couplings like those in eq.([lphikk ] ) for the @xmath167 to @xmath159 and @xmath8 ,",
    "these two amplitudes , once projected in the @xmath10 channel , and close to the @xmath167 pole , are given by @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the modulus of the center of mass three - momentum of the @xmath179 particle .",
    "the diagram of fig.6b can be interpreted as providing an effective strong @xmath180 coupling .    by looking at the residues of the @xmath175 and @xmath163 amplitudes in the @xmath167 pole",
    "we can get @xmath181 and @xmath182 .",
    "thus , defining @xmath183 we obtain @xmath184    in eq.([qij ] ) the @xmath185 amplitudes have a large @xmath90 exchange background , which can be eliminated using the residue of the @xmath167 pole obtained via eq.([qij ] ) . yet , numerically this background can be eliminated to a large extend by using the isospin zero combination @xmath186 in the initial state .",
    "hence , the @xmath187 is more efficiently evaluated by means of the combination @xmath188 we have checked numerically that the @xmath189 and the @xmath190 couplings have the same value in our approach .",
    "since we are interested in @xmath7 , we still have to make the connection between the @xmath173 and @xmath21 couplings .",
    "indeed , we have explicitly checked that , when removing the rescattering resummation implicit in the iam ( by setting @xmath191 , see eq .",
    "( [ ret4 ] ) ) , the ratio in eq .",
    "( [ fing ] ) becomes between one and two orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "even more , this drastic reduction in the @xmath192 coupling is also obtained when making @xmath193 , that is , when only removing the kaon loops . therefore the @xmath167 decays to @xmath131 mainly through the mechanism shown in fig.4 ( replacing the @xmath7 by the @xmath167 ) .",
    "this observation allows us to find the kaon loop contribution to @xmath4 that we are looking for , through the same mechanisms of the @xmath167 , since the only difference will be the initial @xmath194 and @xmath195 couplings , which can be canceled taking the following ratio @xmath196 therefore , from eq .",
    "( [ fracgs ] ) , one has @xmath197 with @xmath198 given in eq .",
    "( [ lphikk ] ) .",
    "here we are neglecting the mass difference between the @xmath167 and the @xmath7 resonance , which is around 100 mev . in any case one",
    "has to take into account that : 1 ) the important @xmath90 exchange effect is also canceled in the ratios .",
    "2 ) we have removed in eq .",
    "( [ qij ] ) the three - momenta factors . as a result",
    ", the remaining differences coming from the mass difference should be rather tiny .",
    "finally , by adding the above contribution with that of eq.([g8phikk ] ) , we find @xmath199 which allows us to obtain the @xmath200 decay width as we did before only for the @xmath201 coupling . in order to determine the sign of the interference in eq.([totg ] ) it is important to know the sign of @xmath202 ( see eqs.([lphikk ] ) and ( [ lphipipi ] ) ) .",
    "we have taken @xmath203 since the @xmath204 chiral parameter , whose main resonance contribution is given by @xmath205 @xcite , is positive and large .",
    "the direct coupling @xmath206 violates the ozi rule .",
    "this is clearly seen in a quark picture when considering the @xmath7 as a pure @xmath207 state .",
    "from the qcd lagrangian one can see the ozi rule as a prediction of the @xmath91 expansion , with @xmath13 the number of colors . while the couplings of the decays which do not violate the ozi rule are @xmath208 @xcite , those that violate the ozi rule are suppressed by an extra @xmath91 .",
    "in addition , meson loops are suppressed by at least one power of @xmath91 @xcite . as a consequence , the @xmath209 coupling given in eq .",
    "( [ gcouple ] ) , which is due to kaon loops , as discussed above , is @xmath210 .",
    "note , in contrast , that the @xmath198 coupling , from eq .",
    "( [ lphikk ] ) , is order @xmath211 , since @xmath45 and @xmath67 are @xmath212 and @xmath213 is order 1 .",
    "however , in quark model calculations @xcite the large @xmath13 suppression of two intermediate meson states is considered insufficient in order to explain the experimental success of the ozi rule .",
    "the point is that in these models the real parts of the two meson loop contributions to ozi violating processes , although large @xmath13 subleading , are found to be much larger than they should be in order to explain the experimental success of the ozi rule .",
    "the solution advocated by the authors is that a cancellation among a very large number of intermediate states seems to operate .",
    "this is illustrated via the example of @xmath214 mixing in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one should notice that the real part of the two - meson loop is divergent , and the remnant finite part depends upon the regularization and renormalization schemes , apart , of course , from the details of the dynamical model .",
    "in refs.@xcite this regularization is done including several cut - offs within a quark flux tube model , having an explicit scale dependence .",

    "the physical quantities we calculate are scale independent and well defined , since any change in the cut - off would be reabsorbed by a change in the @xmath28 chpt counterterms .",
    "note that , since we are making use of an effective field theory formalism , the chiral lagrangian counterterms should take into account any other contribution from more massive intermediate states . in our approach",
    "we use chpt up to @xmath124 and generate higher orders through eq .",
    "( [ iam ] ) . in this way",
    ", any other contribution coming from heavier virtual intermediate states is reabsorbed in the final values of the @xmath28 counterterms given in table 1 . at this point ,",
    "our previous statement about the fact that our result for the @xmath216 coupling is due to kaon loops is meaningful only because we have taken a natural value for the cut - off . for such value",
    ", the contribution from graphs without kaon or pion loops , which come just from the @xmath28 counterterms , is between one and two orders of magnitude smaller than that of kaon loops . comparing our work with that of refs .",
    "@xcite , we can not tell exactly the size of each separate contribution due to each state more massive than the kaons . if each one of these contributions was large as it happens in refs .",
    "@xcite , then , we would also be finding a cancellation .    in order to obtain further support for our arguments about the kaon loop size ,",
    "it is instructive to revisit , within the iam formalism , the kaon loop contribution to @xmath103 that we estimated in sect.ii.b .",
    "note that the value obtained for the @xmath214 mixing from kaon loops in sect.ii.b was dependent on the regularization scale .",
    "in contrast , in the iam this dependence is canceled with that of the chiral parameters @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , the iam respects unitarity and accounts for isospin breaking not only in the loops ( through different masses of the charged and neutral kaons ) , but also in the @xmath217 and @xmath218 couplings and the @xmath219 amplitudes .    in order to reinterpret our results for the @xmath173 coupling in terms of an @xmath220 mixing and compare with sect.ii.a . , we write ( see fig.7 ) @xmath221 with @xmath222 from eq.([lag ] ) .",
    "this gives us @xmath223 , from where , using eq.([mixing ] ) and the fact that the @xmath54 does not couple to @xmath224 at the leading chiral order , we obtain @xmath225.\\ ] ] taking now the value for @xmath226 obtained in the iam from eq.([fing ] ) , with @xmath227 from eq.([lag ] ) , we arrive at a value of @xmath228 and @xmath229 .",
    "these results corroborate the `` order of magnitude '' arguments given in sect.ii.b . , obtained using the non - unitary eq.([loopkaon ] ) , to show that the kaon loop contributions are very small relative to the dominant ozi allowed contribution .",
    "it is also interesting to remark that the cancellation between mesons loops in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite does not operate for the scalar sector with vacuum quantum numbers @xmath230 as discussed in ref .",
    "the failure of the large @xmath13 suppression in this sector , and its associated ozi rule violation , is also discussed in more general terms in ref .",
    "although the scalar sector is very hard to discuss in terms of quark models , due to the large rescattering effects , it is equally well described as the vector channels in the framework of non - perturbative unitarity methods from the chpt series @xcite , see also fig .",
    "5 . for instance , in refs . @xcite the @xmath129 , @xmath231 and @xmath154 were dynamically generated and their meson  meson and @xmath232 decay modes were analyzed in very good agreement with experiment .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite the spectrum in the scalar sector was discussed taking into account as well the large @xmath13 limit .",
    "in addition , the presence of a scalar nonet due to the meson - meson self interactions , which disappears in the limit @xmath233 , was then established . on the other hand",
    ", it was also found that the lightest preexisting scalar nonet , with mass @xmath234 in the @xmath13 counting , should comprise a singlet around 1 gev and an octet around 1.4 gev , in qualitative agreement with the expectations of ref .",
    "the success of our approach in the @xmath235 sector indicates that our techniques are powerful in the study of ozi violating processes .",
    "note that we describe both vector and scalar channels without including any new ad - hoc elements .",
    "in this section we are going to present the resulting branching ratios for the @xmath119 decay . to do that we will consider and discuss the different sources contributing to the total @xmath236 coupling as given in eq.([gcontribs ] ) .",
    "we first consider the contribution @xmath237 introduced in sec.ii.a .",
    "we take as a final value @xmath23810^{-3}$ ] where the uncertainty is mainly due to the value of @xmath30 , which ranges between @xmath239 mev , coming from the @xmath80 decay , and @xmath240 mev , coming from the @xmath241 decay , when evaluating both them with eqs .",
    "( [ lag ] ) and ( [ vtilde ] ) .    concerning the kaon - loop contributions to the @xmath3 mixing eq.([gcouple ] ) , after averaging over all the fits presented in table 1 ,",
    "we obtain : @xmath242 10^{-3}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] let us note that the error is mainly due to the differences between the @xmath28 corresponding to the different fits , since they are much larger than the errors given by minuit , which are certainly underestimated .",
    "furthermore , we have checked that this error band spans the dispersion in the results due to the variations of the chiral parameters that could yield a reasonable fit .",
    "although they were not present in eq.([gcontribs ] ) there are corrections coming from diagrams with photon loops which are expected to be of the same order of magnitude as the isospin breaking corrections from the different mass of charged and neutral mesons @xcite .",
    "we do not have means at present to evaluate these diagrams within the non - perturbative chiral scheme which we have followed .",
    "one would also need counterterms whose values are nowadays unknown . however , explicit calculations of the absorptive part of the @xmath243 intermediate channel in ref .",
    "@xcite give a contribution of , _ at most _ , 1/4 of the kaon loops but _ with opposite sign_. this @xmath243 will be our largest source of uncertainty in the errors given for each one of the different @xmath6 scenarios , that we discuss next .",
    "as we have already commented , the contribution from the two step @xmath18 mechanism , depends on the @xmath6 mixing .",
    "our results are the following :    * strong scenario : we find @xmath24410^{-3}$ ] or @xmath24510^{-3}$ ] , depending on whether we use @xmath115 or @xmath116 , respectively . therefore , there is a large cancellation with the kaon loop contribution , and we obtain : @xmath246 where the uncertainty in the central values depends on whether we use @xmath115 or @xmath116 , respectively . *",
    "weak scenario : we get @xmath24710^{-3}$ ] , very small compared with both the electromagnetic and kaon - loop contributions .",
    "thus , there is only a partial cancellation of the electromagnetic contribution with that of kaon loops , and we obtain @xmath248    apart from the contributions discussed so far , there is also the possibility of local terms giving rise to a direct @xmath249 mixing",
    ". however , one can argue that , by resonance saturation , the inclusion of the two - step process @xmath18 can be enough to take care of such local terms by considering that they are resummed on the @xmath50 propagator .",
    "in this work we have evaluated the kaon loop contribution to the @xmath250 decay via @xmath3 mixing from the splitting of meson masses , making use of the unitarized chiral amplitudes with strong isospin breaking .",
    "we have shown that although this strong contribution to the @xmath251 decay gives rise to smaller branching ratios by itself than the tree level electromagnetic contributions , they can have a very large destructive interference with either the electromagnetic or the @xmath18 contributions .",
    "we have also estimated the error in our @xmath119 branching ratio calculation coming from the uncertainties in @xmath30 , the fitted @xmath124 chpt counterterms , the photon - loop contributions , as well as the considered @xmath6 mixing scenarios .",
    "a complete calculation of the loops with photons is missing in the present work , although they have been estimated making use of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite . still , they are the main source of uncertainty within each @xmath6 mixing scenario .    accepting this additional uncertainty , we find that the strong coupling scenario @xcite yields @xmath252 in very good agreement with the experimental results of ref.@xcite .",
    "in contrast , the weak @xcite scenario yields @xmath253 it seems to prefer a value somewhat lower than the experimental value provided by ref.@xcite , although still reasonably compatible with it .    of course , a precise determination of the photon loops in the non - perturbative regime would be desirable to reduce the theoretical uncertainties .    finally , we would like to remark that the solution of the experimental conflict in the @xmath4 will , eventually , help us to discard some of the @xmath6 mixing scenarios proposed in the literature .",
