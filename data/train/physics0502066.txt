    "otherwise , no link is drawn from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and @xmath4 .",
    "note that the direction of the link always follows that of the wealth flow , since exported ( imported ) goods correspond to wealth flowing in ( out ) .",
    "in such a description , if @xmath5 denotes the number of world countries during year @xmath2 , the _ in - degree _ @xmath6 and the _ out - degree _ @xmath7 of a country @xmath0 correspond to the number of countries importing from and exporting to @xmath0 respectively .",
    "the structure of the wtw continuously changes in time due to variations in the number @xmath5 of world countries and to the continuous rearrangement of its connections , and hence of @xmath8 . while previous studies focused on the undirected description of a single snapshot of the wtw @xcite , in the present work we study the properties of the wtw as a directed and evolving network and we confirm that its topology always displays a peculiar dependence on the gross domestic product of world countries , in excellent accordance with the so - called _ fitness model _ @xcite .",
    "we first review the previous results and then extend them by reporting the temporal evolution of the relevant parameters .",
    "our analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset @xcite reporting the annual trade activity between all world countries together with the annual values of their total gross domestic product during the period 1950 - 1996 .",

    "an important result that we report here is that the same qualitative trends are observed for each year in the database ( 1950 - 1996 ) and can be described quantitatively by plotting the temporal evolution of the relevant parameters .",
    "for instance , in fig.[fig1]c we show the evolution of the number of countries @xmath5 during such time interval . for the 1995 data ,",
    "the number of countries equals @xmath30 .",
    "one first - order topological property is the _ degree distribution _ @xmath31 . in ref.@xcite",
    "we showed that , contrary to previous results @xcite suggesting a power - law form of the distribution with exponent @xmath32 , the scale - free behaviour is suppressed by a sharp cut - off , which is actually restricted to a narrow region ( see fig.[fig2]a , where a power law with exponent @xmath32 is shown as a comparison ) .",
    "a second - order topological property , related to the form of the two - vertices joint degree distribution @xmath33 , is obtained by plotting the _ average nearest neighbour degree _ ( annd ) , defined as @xmath34 , versus the degree @xmath35 ( see fig.[fig2]b ) .",
    "the decreasing trend shown in the figure clearly signals that the degrees of neighbouring vertices are anticorrelated , or in other words that the wtw is a _ disassortative _",
    "network @xcite . from an economic point of view",
    ", this means that countries with many trade partners are on average connected to countries with few partners @xcite .",
    "finally , the third - order correlation structure ( related to the three - vertices joint degree distribution ) can be investigated by plotting the _ clustering coefficient _ @xmath36 versus the degree @xmath35 . as shown in fig.[fig2]c ,",

    "a very intriguing result @xcite is that the above topological properties of the wtw are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the _ fitness _ network model @xcite , assuming that the probability that two vertices are connected is a function of some _ hidden variable _ or _ fitness _ associated to each of them ( again , we are considering the wtw as an undirected network ) . in other words , if each vertex @xmath0 is assigned a fitness value @xmath39 , the model assumes that the probability @xmath40 that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are connected is a function @xmath41 of @xmath39 and @xmath42 alone .",
    "all the expected topological properties therefore depend only on the functional form of @xmath43 and on the fitness distribution @xmath44 . for the wtw",
    ", we showed that the _ gross domestic product _ ( gdp in the following ) of a country can be successfully identified with the fitness of the corresponding vertex @xcite . extending the formalism to the evolving case , if @xmath45 denotes the gdp of country @xmath0 at time @xmath2 we can introduce the adimensional variable @xmath46 and interpret it as the _ fitness _ of vertex @xmath0 .",
    "then , once the form of @xmath43 is chosen , all the expected topological properties predicted by the model can be compared with the empirical ones .",
    "if at every timestep @xmath2 the gdp is regarded as ( proportional to ) the potential number of trade connections that a country can develop , then the natural choice for @xmath47 reads @xcite @xmath48=\\frac{\\delta(t ) x_i(t)x_j(t)}{1+\\delta(t ) x_i(t)x_j(t)}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the only free parameter of the model .",
    "the above form ensures that , at a given timestep , different realizations of the network with the same _ degree sequence",
    "_ @xmath50 are equiprobable @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath51 can be fixed by requiring that the expected number of links in the undirected wtw @xmath52\\ ] ] equals the observed one @xmath53 .",
    "after that , the topology is completely specified : the expected degree distribution is obtained by computing the expected degree @xmath54\\ ] ] while the expected average nearest neighbour degree is @xmath55p_t[x_j(t),x_k(t)]}{\\tilde{k}_i(t)}\\ ] ] and the expected clustering coefficient is @xmath56p_t[x_j(t),x_k(t)]p_t[x_k(t),x_i(t)]}{\\tilde{k}_i(t)[\\tilde{k}_i(t)-1]}\\ ] ] for instance , for the year 1995 we found that @xmath57 in order to have @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "the expected properties given by eqs.([k],[annd],[c ] ) obtained with this choice are shown in fig.[fig2 ] as solid lines superimposed to the empirical points .",
    "the accordance is excellent , indicating that the model indeed captures the basic aspects of the wtw topology .",
    "the comprehensive analysis of the whole data set that we are presenting here confirms that the same is true for each snapshot of the network .",
    "we can describe the time evolution in a compact way by studying the temporal change of the statistical gdp distribution and of the parameter @xmath51 ( see figs.[fig3]a - b ) . more specifically , note that the discrete sums @xmath59 on the r.h.s . of eqs.([k],[annd],[c ] ) can be replaced @xcite by integrals of the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 denotes the fitness distribution at time @xmath2 . therefore , besides @xmath51 , the model predictions only depend on @xmath5 and @xmath61 and the evolution of these three quantities completely specifies the evolution of the network ( together with @xmath18 if one is interested in the directed character of the wtw ) . in fig.[fig3]a we plot the fitness distribution in its cumulative form @xmath62 .",
    "we find that the tail of the distribution always collapses to a time - independent pareto tail with exponent -1 , corresponding to a power - law @xmath63 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath51 during the 1950 - 1996 time interval is instead shown in fig.[fig3]b .",
    "a very important goal would be to relate the time variation of the parameters to the minimum possible number of external , unpredictable factors .",
    "for instance , the variation of @xmath5 is of course due to complicated geopolitical reasons and should therefore be taken as an input information .",
    "by contrast , the seemingly irregular behaviour of @xmath51 can be probably explained in terms of more regular quantities .",
    "for instance , we recall that @xmath51 determines the number of links @xmath64 and is therefore related to the _ link density",
    "_ @xmath65}$ ] ( ratio of observed to possible links ) .",
    "interestingly , we find that @xmath66 displays relatively small fluctuations about the value 0.4 ( see fig.[fig3]c ) , a result related to the way new links form in the network ( for instance , when a country ` splits ' in two or more countries , these can ` inherit ' the links of the initial country ) .",
    "the form and evolution of @xmath44 has to be traced back to the dynamics of the gdp that takes place on the network .",
    "models of wealth dynamics on complex networks @xcite highlight how the topology determines the form of the wealth distribution .",
    "the results discussed here show that the reverse is also true , and therefore lead us to the intriguing picture of a countinuous feedback between dynamics and topology , a scenario that intimately relates the results of network theory to those of economic modelling .     of the model .",
