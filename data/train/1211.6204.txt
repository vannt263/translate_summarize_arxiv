    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 gives our data procedures and main results .",
    "section 3 shows our discussions and conclusions . here",
    ", cosmological parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 have been adopted .",
    "all public spectra of 3c390.3 can be collected from the agnwatch project ( http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~agnwatch/ ) , which is a consortium of astronomers who have studied the inner structures of agn through continuum and emission - line variability .",
    "detailed descriptions about observational instruments , techniques and procedures to reduce the spectra of 3c390.3 can be found in dietrich et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which will not be described any more . here",
    ", we mainly show our procedures to measure line parameters ( line width and line flux ) of the double - peaked broad lines of 3c390.3 , and show our results about correlation of the line parameters .",
    "we mainly focus on line parameters of broad h@xmath0 of 3c390.3 , due to the following two main reasons . on the one hand , the broad h@xmath0 is much stronger than the broad h@xmath14 , which leads to more reliable line parameters . on the other hand",
    ", there is much less contamination on the broad h@xmath0 .",
    "only the narrow emission lines , the narrow h@xmath0 and [ n  ii ] doublet , have effects on the measured line parameters of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 .",
    "however , for the double - peaked broad h@xmath14 , besides the common narrow h@xmath14 and [ o  iii ] doublet , the extended [ o  iii ] doublet and some weak optical fe  ii emission lines ( dietrich et al . 2012 ) have effects on the measured line parameters of the broad h@xmath14 .",
    "thus , focusing on the observed spectrum around h@xmath0 of 3c390.3 should lead to more accurate line parameters and to find more reliable correlation of the line parameters .    for 3c390.3",
    ", there are 67 public spectra observed around 1995 including available h@xmath0 which can be collected from the agnwatch project , based on those reported parameters listed in table 9  in dietrich et al .",
    "then the line parameters of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 are measured as follows . in order to ignore effects of the narrow lines , the double - peaked broad component of h@xmath0",
    "is firstly described and fitted by the theoretical elliptical accretion disk model proposed by eracleous et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . here",
    ", our main objective is not to accurately determine the disk parameters through theoretical model , thus , there are no further discussions about disk parameters , which has been discussed in detail in our another paper ( zhang 2011a , paper i ) . in other words , we only require that the line profiles of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 can be best described and be well separated from the narrow lines . in this paper , we show the best fitted results for the apparent double - peaked broad h@xmath0 in figure  [ 3c390 ] , and the corresponding residuals in figure  [ res ] . in figure  [ res ] , we also show the best fitted results for the narrow lines of h@xmath0 and [ n  ii]@xmath15  by three standard gaussian functions with the same redshift and with line parameters ratio of [ n  ii ] doublet fixed to theoretical values . based on the results shown in figure  [ 3c390 ] and figure  [ res ] , the double - peaked broad component of h@xmath0 can be clearly separated from the narrow lines .",
    "then , the line width ( second moment ) and the line flux of the double - peaked broad component can be estimated by ( peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the line profile of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 after subtraction of the narrow lines . here , the main reasons to use the second moment rather than fwhm ( full width at half maximum ) are : the second moment rather than the fwhm can be used to well trace kepler velocities of broad line clouds in blr of agn ( fromerth & melia 2000 , peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) , the second moment rather than the fwhm is well defined for arbitrary line profiles ( such as the double - peaked broad line profile ) , and moreover the second moment rather than the fwhm has relatively lower uncertainty ( peterson et al .",
    "the measured line widths ( @xmath18 ) of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 from the observed spectra are listed in table 1 .    before proceeding further , it is necessary to estimate the corresponding uncertainty of the measured line width of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 . here , the commonly used bootstrap method ( peterson et al . 1998 , 2004 , press et al .",
    "1992 , zhang 2011b ) is applied to estimate the uncertainty .",
    "based on each observed double - peaked broad h@xmath0 with narrow lines ( [ n  ii ] , [ s  ii],[o  i ] doublets and narrow h@xmath0 ) having been subtracted , 400 mock double - peaked lines can be created by the bootstrap method . when the bootstrap method is applied , we should avoid the selection of some adjacent data points to create mock lines , otherwise , the following estimated uncertainty should be unreasonably small , due to few variation of line profile .",
    "then line widths of the 400 mock lines are measured by equation ( 3 ) .",
    "after that , standard deviation of the 400 measured line widths of the mock lines is accepted as the uncertainty of the line width of the observed double - peaked broad h@xmath0 , and listed in table 1 .",
    "certainly , we should note that peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) accepted @xmath19 as the mean uncertainty of the line width of broad h@xmath14 of 3c390.3 within observed wavelength range from 5006to 5246 .",
    "it is consistent with our value @xmath20 , which indicates our estimated uncertainties for the line width of all the 67 double - peaked broad h@xmath0 are reasonable and acceptable .    besides the line width and the corresponding uncertainty , it is not difficult to accomplish spectral flux calibration for 3c390.3",
    "however , because the spectra of 3c390.3 are observed by different instruments in different observatories under different configurations , the flux calibration based on the direct observed line profile should have low confidence level . as discussed in detail in the section 2 of dietrich et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , some further procedures have been applied to complete the flux calibration .",
    "the spectra are firstly photometrically calibrated by comparison with the broadband photometric measurements ( being convolved with the spectral response curve of the johnson v and r ) , and then scaled by multiplicative factors to achieve the same total flux ratio as the intercalibrated photometric measurements in v and r bands .",
    "after that , the spectra have to be intercalibrated to a common flux level , in order to correct the effects for different wavelength shifts , and different spectral resolutions in different spectra .",
    "all the procedures have been successfully done by dietrich et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , so that we directly collect the line fluxes ( @xmath21 ) and corresponding uncertainties of broad h@xmath0 listed in dietrich et al .",
    "moreover , in spite of the effects from different flux scales for the observed spectra , those directly measured line fluxes of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 ( @xmath22 , no corrections being considered ) are also listed in table 1 .    before the end of the subsection , there are two points we should note . on the one hand , we do not try to confirm that the pure elliptical accretion disk model ( eracleous et al . 1995 ) is the unique true physical model for the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 .",
    "we only use the theoretical disk model to separate the double - peaked broad component from the narrow lines .",
    "the properties of the residuals shown in figure  [ res ] for the best fitted results shown in figure  [ 3c390 ] illustrate that it is one good choice to determine the double - peaked broad component by the theoretical elliptical disk model for the spectra around 1995 . on the other hand , although we do not apply the intercalibration method ( van groningen & wanders 1992 ) to correct the effects from small wavelength shifts , different spectral resolutions and different flux scales for different spectra as what have been done in dietrich et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the measured second moment through observed spectrum is accurate and reliable , because the applied broadening velocity in the intercalibration method for 3c390.3 is only ten or more kilometers per second or smaller , which is can be totally ignored for the measured second moment and the corresponding uncertainty of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 .",
    "thus , the following results based on the measured second moments are reliable .",
    "figure  [ fj_3c390 ] shows the correlation between the line width and the line flux of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 of 3c390.3 .",
    "linear correlation coefficient for the correlation of @xmath22 versus @xmath18 is about 0.28 with two - sided significance of deviation from zero about @xmath23 for all the 67 spectra listed in table 1 .",
    "the coefficient for the correlation of @xmath21 ( accurate line flux of h@xmath0 from the agnwatch project ) versus @xmath18 is about 0.45 with @xmath24 .",
    "it is clear that there is one positive correction between the line width and the line flux of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 for 3c390.3 .",
    "furthermore , under considerations of the uncertainties of the parameters in both coordinates , the best fitted results for @xmath21 versus @xmath18 can be written as @xmath25 certainly , we should note the accurate flux @xmath21 collected from the agnwatch project includes the contributions from the narrow emission lines of @xmath26 and [ n  ii ] doublet .",
    "however , the contributions do not affect the positive correlation , because the flux of the narrow emission lines of each spectrum is constant .",
    "the best fitted results are shown as solid lines in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] .",
    "the corresponding 99.95% confidence bands for the best fitted results are also shown in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] .",
    "it is clear that the uncertainty of the measured second moment ( @xmath27 ) of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 has important effects on our final conclusion about the positive correlation for 3c390.3 , because the varying range of second moment is not large , @xmath28 .",
    "if the uncertainty of the second moment is large enough to cover the varying range of the second moment , the shown positive correlation in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] should be fake .",
    "thus , it is necessary to check whether larger uncertainties should be possible for our measured line width . here , we simply consider the question as follows .",
    "for one given theoretical line profile of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 with second moment @xmath18 ( solid line shown in figure  [ 3c390 ] ) best fitted for the observed line profile , if the corresponding uncertainty @xmath27 for the second moment is reasonable , we will find that after being broadened by velocity @xmath29 for the theoretical line profile , the new theoretical line profile with second moment @xmath30 still well describes the observed double - peaked broad line profile of h@xmath0 .",
    "here , the value of @xmath29 can be determined by @xmath31 . based on the listed values in table 1",
    ", we can find that the common broadening velocity is around 20  ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "figure  [ res2 ] shows one example about the being broadened line profile . in the figure , we can find that the being broadened line profile ( the idl function convol being applied ) with @xmath33 has begun to lead to some bad fitted results for the spectrum around the blue peak ( @xmath34 ) of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 , which indicates larger broadening velocity should be unreasonable . in other words ,",
    "the varying range of the second moment is larger enough to ignore the effects of the uncertainty of the second moment on the positive correlation shown in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] , and the positive correlation is reliable .    besides the unexpected positive correlation shown in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] for 3c390.3 , we wish to check the correlation of line parameters of broad lines for the other well - known mapped normal broad line agn , in order to frankly show that the positive correlation for the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 is very interesting .",

    "is determined by the bootstrap method . here",
    ", we do not show all the observed spectra of ngc5548 , but only show one spectrum as an example in the top - right panel of figure  [ fj_ngc5548 ] .",

    "the best fitted results with the considerations of the uncertainties of the parameters in both coordinates can be written as @xmath36 it is clear there is one strong negative correlation for ngc5548 , which is well consistent with the expected result under the virialization assumption : @xmath37 .",
    "undoubtfully , the negative correlation is well consistent with the negative correlation between the size of blr and the line width found in bentz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , denney et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "based on the results above , we can find that there is one reliable positive correlation between the line width and the line flux of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 for the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 , which is against the expected negative correlation confirmed for the other mapped agn .",
    "the unexpected positive correlation should indicate different structures of blrs of the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 and normal broad line agn .",
    "it is clear that the reliable positive correlation shown in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] for the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 is against the expected result through the virialization assumption .",
    "thus the following three questions are mainly considered , what determines the unexpected positive correlation ? whether the virialization assumption is still available for double - peaked emitters ? whether the unexpected positive correlation can be found for the other double - peaked emitters ?      for normal broad line agn , such as ngc5548 , the strong negative correlation of the broad line parameters can be naturally explained by the following simple viewpoint : blr kinematics are dominated by central gravity ( some more recent reviews can be found in down et al .",
    "2010 , sluse et al .",
    "2011 ) , which could be well appropriate to the broad line seyfert 1 galaxy ngc5548 ( bentz et al .",
    "2007 , denney et al .",
    "2010 , peterson et al .",
    "2002 , 2004 , wanders & peterson 1996 , ) and some other mapped broad line agn ( peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) : stronger continuum emission leads to deeper ionization boundary ( larger flux - weighted size of blr ) and leads to smaller general rotating velocity ( smaller line width ) . and then , through the broad line strength being applied to estimate the size of blr , @xmath38 , the negative correlation of the line width and the line flux can be found .",
    "certainly , the viewpoint is not appropriate to the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 .",
    "if the theoretical accretion disk model was accepted , what result about the correlation between the size of blr and the continuum / line flux should be expected for 3c390.3 ? in the context of the theoretical disk model for double - peaked emitters , such as the elliptical accretion disk model ( eracleous et al .",
    "1995 ) which can be well applied to best fit the observed line spectra of 3c390.3 observed around 1995 , the disk - like blr is locating into the central accretion disk , and does share the kinematic characters of the central accretion disk . for 3c390.3 ,",
    "the inner and outer boundary radii of the elliptical disk - like blr are about @xmath39 and @xmath40 , under the theoretical accretion disk model ( eracleous & halpern 1994 , 2003 , flohic & eracleous 2008 , shapovalova et al .",
    "2001 , zhang 2011a , paper i ) .",
    "based on the oversimplified extended disk - like blr ( no considerations of tiny contributions from probable hot spots , warped structures , spiral arms etc . for 3c390.3 around 1995 ) , one simple result can be expected : stronger continuum emission leads to stronger broad line emission coming from the inner part of the disk - like blr ( and then larger line width ) in one short period ( much shorter than the traveling time for ionizing photons through the whole blr ) , because the stronger ionizing continuum firstly reaches the inner part of the disk - like blr .    in other words , stronger continuum emission ( strong line flux ) leads to larger flux ratio of the broad h@xmath0 from the inner part of the blr to the broad h@xmath0 from the outer part of the blr , and leads to larger line width due to larger contributions from the higher velocity clouds in inner part of blr , which is similar as the results shown in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] .",
    "so that , we check the properties of the broad line flux ratio @xmath41 , where @xmath42 means the broad line flux coming from the inner part of disk - like blr with radius from @xmath43 to @xmath44 and @xmath45 means the measured total broad line flux . the calculated value of r for each spectrum is listed in table 1 .",

    "the spearman - rank correlation coefficient for the correlation is about 0.49 with @xmath47 for the parameter @xmath21 in table 1 and 0.26 with @xmath48 for the parameter @xmath22 in table 1 .",
    "the positive correlation in figure  [ fr ] indicates the proposed disk origination for the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 of 3c390.3 can be naturally applied to explain the unexpected positive correlation shown in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] .",
    "moreover , if the observed broad h@xmath0 of 3c390.3 was seperated into two parts : one part with larger line width ( @xmath49 ) coming from the inner region of the disk - like blr with radius from @xmath43 to @xmath50 , and the other part with smaller line width ( @xmath51 ) coming from the outer region of the disk - like blr , then the line width ( @xmath18 ) of the total observed double - peaked broad h@xmath0 can be re - written as ( zhang 2011b ) @xmath52 where @xmath46 is the flux ratio of @xmath41 .",
    "the equation above can be easily proved by definition of second moment ( equation 3 ) .",
    "based on the mean disk parameters shown in our paper i ( zhang 2011a ) , we have @xmath53 and @xmath54 . through the equation",
    "above , in order to obtain the measured line width of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 varying from @xmath55  to @xmath56(minimum and maximum values for the second moment of broad h@xmath0 of 3c390.3 ) , the parameter of @xmath46 should be varying from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , which is consistent with the shown results about r in figure  [ fr ] and in table 1 .",
    "the results above indicate that the unexpected positive correlation shown in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] for 3c390.3 can be naturally explained by the proposed accretion disk origination of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 .",
    "certainly , here we do not consider effects from probable external ionizing source for the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 , which will be discussed in detail in subsection 3.4 .",
    "as the most convenient method to estimate central black hole masses of broad line agn , the virialization assumption has been widely and commonly accepted .",

    "considering the oversimplified case , the disk - like blr of 3c390.3 is separated into one inner region with radius from @xmath43 to @xmath50 and the other outer region , then the flux weighted distance between the two regions to the central black hole can be calculated based on the simple elliptical accretion disk model ( eracleous et al .",

    "the results above indicate that the virialization assumption is still available for the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 . however , the common empirical relation @xmath2 is not available to show the properties of * time - varying * size of blrs of 3c390.3 . in other words ,",
    "based on the * mean * continuum luminosity ( broad line luminosity ) in one long period , the * mean * size of blr can be estimated by the empirical relation @xmath2 , however , the time - varying size of blr is decreasing with the line luminosity increasing .",
    "besides the well - known double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 , there are several other double - peaked emitters , of which the double - peaked broad line profiles have been studied and reported . some simple results about correlation between peak separation ( in some literature",
    ", peak separation was used as substitute for line width ) and line flux ( continuum emission ) can be found .    in figure 4 of shapovalova",
    "2001 ) , we can find one rough negative correlation between peak separation and line flux ( continuum emission ) for the double - peaked broad h@xmath14 of 3c390.3 observed from 1995 to 2000 .",
    "similarly negative correlation can be found for the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 of ngc1097 ( schimoia et al .",
    "2012 , storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "however , through study of one sample of double - peaked emitters , lewis et al .",
    "( 2010 ) have shown that there is no confirmed correlation between the peak separation and the line flux for long - term observed double - peaked broad h@xmath0 , and additionally , the expected negative correlation between the line width ( either fwhm or fwqm ) and the broad h@xmath0 flux is not observed .",
    "the contradictory is mainly due to the following reason : there are important effects on peak separation from varying of physical disk parameters , such as the effects from accretion disk precession , in the context of the accretion disk model for double - peaked emitters .    as we have seen that the proposed accretion disk models for double - peaked emitters lead to one important result : disk precession ( or physical disk structure parameters varying ) dominates the line profile variations of double - peaked broad line , besides the not so important contributions from the other subtle structures , such as the hot spots , warped structures etc .. in some cases , such as disk - like blr with large eccentricity @xmath70 under the elliptical accretion disk model , even there were no variations of continuum emission , only the orientation angle of elliptical rings @xmath71 varying ( pure accretion disk precession ) should lead line width ( second moment ) varying by 30% , which can be simply verified by the proposed theoretical models .",
    "thus , when we consider the correlation of the line parameters of double - peaked broad lines , the effects from the accretion disk precession ( or from the other physical disk parameters varying ) should be firstly corrected . however , before confirming one clear theoretical model for one double - peaked emitter , it is hard to correct these effects .",
    "one good choice to ignore the effects of accretion disk parameters varying is to consider short - term observed spectra with few variations of line profiles .",
    "that is the main reason why only the spectra around 1995 are collected for the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 , because the line profiles around 1995 are almost stable with less effects from disk parameters varying , as what we have discussed in our paper i ( zhang 2001a ) .",
    "however , in lewis et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , schimoia et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , shapovalova et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the observed double - peaked broad lines have apparent variations of both peak flux ratios and peak positions , which indicate apparent variations of accretion disk physical parameters .",
    "if only continuum variations are considered , there should be much weak variations for peak positions and peak flux ratios , besides apparent variations of line intensity .",
    "moreover , we further check the listed parameters in the literature for the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 , under the virialization assumption : @xmath72 . in wandel",
    "et al . ( 1999 ) and peterson et al . ( 2004 ) , the size of blr and the corresponding line width are @xmath73 and @xmath74 for 3c390.3 around 1995 . in shapovalova",
    "et al . ( 2001 ) , the size of blr and the corresponding line width are @xmath75 ( similar results can be found in popovic et al .",
    "2011 , some larger results can be found in sergeev et al .",
    "2011 ) and @xmath76 for 3c390.3 from 1995 to 2000 .",
    "it is clear that based on the measured line width ( fwhm ) and the size of blr , we have @xmath77 , which indicates the measured line width ( fwhm ) varying does not obey the virialization assumption . in other words , in one long - term observed period , the effects of accretion disk physical parameter varying should be important , especially on the line profile varying , so that the measured line width ( fwhm ) can not accurately trace the kepler velocity of broad line clouds for long - term spectra .    in",
    "order to more clearly show our point : the positive correlation between the line width and the line flux is not fake , some evidence to the contrary is shown as follows .",
    "if we accept that the positive correlation shown in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] was fake for 3c390.3 and the common negative correlation could be applied for the double - peaked emitters , i.e. , both the empirical relation @xmath78 for time - varying size of blr and applying peak separation ( @xmath79 ) to replace the second moment were available for 3c390.3 , we will have @xmath80 , under the virialization assumption . for the spectra of 3c390.3  in shapovalova et al . (",
    "2001 ) , the line luminosity ratio of maximum @xmath81 to minimum @xmath81 is about @xmath82 , however , the forth power of the line width ratio of minimum @xmath79 to maximum @xmath79 is about @xmath83 , which is against the expected result @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , for ngc1097 in schimoia et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and and storchi - bergmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , the line luminosity ratio of maximum @xmath85 to minimum @xmath86 is about @xmath87 , however , the forth power of the line width ratio of minimum @xmath79 to maximum @xmath79 is about @xmath88 .",
    "similar results can be found for the double - peaked emitters discussed in lewis et al .",
    "( 2010 ) : the parameter @xmath89 is much different from the parameter @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 for 3c59 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 for ie0450.3 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 for pictor a , @xmath97 and @xmath98 for cbs74 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 for pks0921 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 for pks1020 , @xmath103 and @xmath96 for pks1739 .",
    "the results re - confirm that for long - term observed double - peaked broad lines , the parameter of the peak separation is not one good substitute to trace the kepler velocity of the broad line clouds , and clearly indicates the correlation shown in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] is definitely different from the previous reported results about the peak separation in the literature .    the results above indicate that for double - peaked emitters , it should be one good choice to check the virialization assumption ( the correlation of line parameters ) by one sample of short - term observed spectra rather than by one sample of long - term observed spectra , in order to ignore the effects of physical disk parameters varying .",
    "finally , we consider the question : whether the positive correlation of line parameters could be common for all double - peaked emitters , if the effects of blr physical parameter varying could be clearly considered ?",
    "the most important starting point for the positive correlation is that the central ionizing continuum emission is coming from one point - like source , so that there are different arriving times of ionizing photos in different parts of disk - like blrs of double - peaked emitters .",
    "however , as discussed in the literature , one external ionizing source should be necessary for some double - peaked emitters ( chen et al .",
    "1989 , eracleous & halpern 1994 , 2003 , luo et al .",
    "2009 , strateva et al .",
    "2003 , 2006 , 2008 , wu et al .",
    "2008 ) , due to the energy budget problem : the total double - peaked broad line flux likely exceeds the viscous energy that can be extracted locally from the accretion disk . if the extended size of the external ionizing source is large enough to cover the disk - like blrs of double - peaked emitters , the expected different time delays for different parts of blrs should be not so apparent , and then no apparent positive correlation between the line width and the line flux of broad double - peaked lines could be found .",
    "commonly , parameter @xmath104 ( ratio of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 luminosity to the viscous power output of the line - emitting portion of the accretion disk ) is used to determine existence of one external ionizing source ( collin - souffrin 1987 , dumont & collin - souffrin 1990 , strateva et al .",
    "2008 , williams 1980 ) . for 3c390.3 , eracleous & halpern ( 2003 , 1994 ) have shown that the parameter @xmath105 is about @xmath106 with energy transfer efficiency @xmath107 being accepted . here",
    "the used @xmath86 and @xmath108 are the updated values listed in eracleous & halpern ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , we should note that the energy transfer efficiency is much larger than 0.01 for 3c390.3 .",
    "based on the empirical relation shown in davis & laor ( 2011 ) and the more recent black hole mass of 3c390.3  in dietrich et al .",
    "( 2012 , @xmath109 ) , the energy transfer efficiency for 3c390.3 is about @xmath110 . so that the parameter of @xmath105 is about @xmath111 , which is much smaller than the limited value of @xmath112 .",
    "so that , it is not necessary for one external ionizing source for the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 .",
    "furthermore , through the reverberation mapping technique ( blandford & mckee 1982 , peterson 1993 ) , the uv emission region is within 5 light - days ( dietrich et al .",
    "1998 ) , which is much smaller than the size of blr ( @xmath113 in peterson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ( certainly , much smaller than the size of blr shown in dietrich et al .",
    "2012 , popovic et al .",
    "2011 , sergeev et al .",
    "2011 and shapovalova et al .",
    "so that the time delays for different parts of the blr of 3c390.3 are apparent , and one positive correlation shown in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] can be expected .",
    "so far , it is still not clear about the structures of the probable needed external ionizing source : external ionizing photos coming from an elevated structure in central region of accretion disk ( standard riaf , cao 2005 , manmoto 2000 ) , or ionizing photos coming from scattering ionizing photons radiated from the inner accretion disk region ( cao & wang 2006 ) , or other unknown structures . before to confirm the structures of the external ionizing source , it is very hard to give one final conclusion that all double - peaked emitters show one positive correlation between line width and line flux for short - term observed spectra .",
    "however , after the corrections of the effects of disk physical parameters varying , once one positive correlation between the line width and the line flux can be confirmed for one broad line , it is extremely possible that the broad line comes from central accretion disk .",
    "the final conclusions are as follows .",
    "* under the virialization assumption and the commonly accepted empirical relation @xmath2 , there should be one strong negative correlation between the line width and the line flux of broad lines for multi - observed spectra of broad line agn : @xmath114 .",
    "the negative correlation can be confirmed for some mapped objects , such as the results shown in figure  [ fj_ngc5548 ] for ngc5548 . *",
    "based on the public spectra of 3c390.3 from the agnwatch project , the correlation between the line width ( second moment ) and the line flux of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 is checked .",
    "however , one unexpected reliable positive correlation is confirmed and shown in figure  [ fj_3c390 ] , which indicates there are different structures of blr for the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 and normal broad line agn . * in the context of the theoretical accretion disk model for double - peaked emitters , the unexpected positive correlation between the line width and the line flux can be naturally explained , due to the different time delays for the different parts of the disk - like blrs of 3c390.3  in one short period . *",
    "the virialization assumption is further checked for the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3 , @xmath115 .",
    "then , we find that the virialization assumption is still available for 3c390.3 , however , the time - varying size of blr in one period can not be expected through the empirical relation of @xmath2 . for the double - peaked emitter 3c390.3",
    ", stronger continuum emission leads to smaller ( not larger ) flux - weighted size of blr in one moment . *",
    "furthermore , we have shown that in the context of the accretion disk model , there are important effects on the correlation of the line parameters from the physical disk parameters varying ( such as the accretion disk precession ) .",
    "that is why there are different conclusions in the literature about the correlation between the peak separation and the line flux for long - term observed double - peaked broad lines .",
    "moreover , it should be better to check the correlation of line parameters of double - peaked broad line through short - term observed spectra , in order to ignore the effects from physical disk parameters varying . *",
    "finally , the correlation between the line width and the line flux is checked for the other double - peaked emitters . however , due to the probable external ionizing source with so far unclear structures , it is hard to confirm that the positive correlation between the line width and the line flux of double - peaked broad lines can be found for all the double - peaked emitters . however",
    ", one strong positive correlation between the line width and the line flux of one broad line should strongly indicate accretion disk origination for the broad line .",

    "<S> in this manuscript , we carefully check the correlation between the line width ( second moment ) and the line flux of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 of the well - known mapped agn 3c390.3 , in order to show some further distinctions between double - peaked emitters and normal broad line agn . based on the virialization assumption @xmath1 and the empirical relation @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , one strong negative correlation between the line width and the line flux of the double - peaked broad lines should be expected for 3c390.3 , such as the negative correlation confirmed for the mapped broad line object ngc5548 , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> but , based on the public spectra around 1995 from the agnwatch project for 3c390.3 , one reliable positive correlation is found between the line width and the line flux of the double - peaked broad h@xmath0 . in the context of the proposed theoretical accretion disk model for double - peaked emitters </S>",
    "<S> , the unexpected positive correlation can be naturally explained , due to different time delays for inner parts and outer parts of disk - like blr of 3c390.3 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the virialization assumption is checked and found to be still available for 3c390.3 . however </S>",
    "<S> , time - varying size of the blr of 3c390.3 can not be expected by the empirical relation @xmath2 . in other words , the mean size of blr of 3c390.3 </S>",
    "<S> can be estimated by the continuum luminosity ( line luminosity ) , while , the continuum emission strengthening leads to the size of blr decreasing ( not increasing ) in different moments for 3c390.3 . </S>",
    "<S> then , we compared our results of 3c390.3 with the previous results reported in the literature for the other double - peaked emitters , and found that before to clearly correct effects from disk physical parameters varying ( such as effects of disk precession ) for long - term observed line spectra , it is not so meaningful to discuss the correlation of line parameters of double - peaked broad lines . furthermore , due to the probable external ionizing source with so far unclear structures , it is hard to give one conclusion that the positive correlation between the line width and the line flux can be found for all double - peaked emitters , even after the considerations of disk physical parameters varying . </S>",
    "<S> however , once one positive correlation of broad line parameters was found , the accretion disk origination of the broad line should be firstly considered .    </S>",
