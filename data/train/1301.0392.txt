    "<S> while the full readout optically pumps the spin , shorter readout durations can be non - destructive , albeit at lower fidelity . by optimizing integration windows </S>",

    "<S> correlations between measurement outcomes indicate that the readout is projective . following preparation of a superposition of spin states , we condition on detection of at least one photon ( i.e. , measurement outcome @xmath20 ) during a first short readout pulse , and probe the resulting spin state with a second readout ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig2]d , blue data points ) . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of the initial spin state , we observe a constant high probability to obtain @xmath20 in the second readout . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the readout method is strongly projective and well suited for application in measurement - based quantum protocols .        </S>",
    "<S> we exploit projective readout of the electron spin in combination with quantum gate operations for initialization and readout of a nuclear spin few - qubit register . </S>",

    "<S> the electronic spin resonance ( esr ) spectrum for nv b ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]a , green trace ) reveals the coupling to the host @xmath30n nuclear spin : two partially overlapping sets of three hyperfine lines correspond to the @xmath31 and @xmath32 electronic spin transitions , zeeman - split by @xmath332mhz in the earth s magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the outermost transitions are associated with a specific nuclear spin state @xmath34 , e.g. @xmath35 at 2.874ghz . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : fig3]a , circuit diagram ) : first , we prepare the electronic spin in @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> we then perform a nuclear - spin - controlled not gate on the electronic spin by applying a @xmath36-pulse at 2.874ghz ; this operation rotates the electronic spin into @xmath6 only when @xmath37 . finally , we read out the electronic spin for 400ns . </S>",
    "<S> if one or more photons are detected during this interval , the two - spin system is projected into ( @xmath38 . alternatively , if we run the same protocol with initial electronic spin state @xmath6 , we prepare the nuclear spin into @xmath39 .    </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency of the nuclear spin initialization is evidenced by its dramatic effect on the esr spectrum ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]a ) . whereas before preparation the depths of the different hyperfine lines indicate an equal mixture of the nuclear spin states ( green trace ) , after preparation only the hyperfine lines corresponding to the prepared states are visible ( @xmath37 for cyan trace and @xmath39 for the orange trace ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the same nuclear spin initialization scheme can be applied to multi - qubit registers . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig3]b displays the esr spectrum of nv a ( green trace ) , whose electronic spin is coupled to both the host @xmath0n nuclear spin and two nearby @xmath2c nuclei ( see supplementary information ) </S>",
    "<S> . the lowest - frequency line corresponds to a single state of the three nuclear spins . </S>",
    "<S> a @xmath36-pulse on this transition therefore implements a triple - controlled - not gate on the electronic spin ( circuit diagram in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]b ) , enabling the initialization of all three nuclear spins ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]b , orange trace ) . </S>",
    "<S> the initialization can be further improved by repeating the preparation step ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]b , red data points ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear qubits can be read out in a single shot by applying a nuclear - controlled - not on the electronic spin and subsequently reading out the electronic spin ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig3]c , d insets ) . </S>",
    "<S> because the electronic spin measurement only has weak back - action on the nuclear spin , we can repeat the process to obtain higher readout fidelity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : fig3]c compares the resulting photon statistics for nv  b after initialization into the single nuclear spin state @xmath37 to those obtained for @xmath39 , indicating an average readout fidelity of @xmath40% . </S>",
    "<S> this number is a lower bound to the true readout fidelity , as it includes errors in the state preparation .    </S>",
    "<S> a straightforward extension of this scheme can be used to read out the complete state of a multi - nuclear - spin register . using a multiply - controlled - not gate in the readout sequence </S>",
    "<S> , we can measure in a single shot whether the register is in a particular configuration . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate this procedure on nv a , where we identify the 3-nuclear - spin state @xmath41 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3d and supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the other possible configurations can be probed by sequential application of this readout scheme on different spectrally - resolved hyperfine transitions , or , alternatively , by systematically flipping the nuclear spin qubits and repeating the readout on the same hyperfine transition .    </S>",
    "<S> electron - nuclear flip - flop processes in the optically excited state , which reduce the nuclear spin readout fidelity , pose a major hurdle for scaling the readout to more qubits . </S>",
    "<S> critically , resonant readout allows selection of which states undergo optical excitation . by starting with the electronic spin in @xmath9 , optical excitation </S>",
    "<S> will only occur when the register is in the state being probed ; therefore , no optically - induced nuclear spin flips will occur during measurement of any of the other states . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in contrast to schemes depending on off - resonant excitation where each additional readout step degrades the fidelity , resonant excitation enables scaling of high - fidelity readout to larger registers .        </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate the compatibility of all the different techniques by implementing them in a single experiment : we initialize , coherently manipulate , and then read out a two - qubit register consisting of the electronic spin and @xmath0n nuclear spin of nv  b. after initialization in @xmath42 , we rotate the nuclear spin using a radiofrequency ( rf ) pulse and subsequently rotate the electronic spin with a microwave ( mw ) pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we then read out the electronic spin , followed by readout of the @xmath0n nuclear spin state ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4]a , circuit diagram ) . </S>",
    "<S> the left panel in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4]a displays the readout results for the electronic spin qubit , showing the rabi oscillations as a function of mw pulse length ( vertical axis ) . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the readout results for the nuclear spin qubit ( right panel of fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : fig4]a ) exhibit rabi oscillations as a function of the rf pulse length ( horizontal axis ) .    to quantify crosstalk </S>",
    "<S> , we closely examine correlations between the two measurement outcomes . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the contrast in the electronic spin rabi oscillations depends on the outcome of the nuclear readout ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4]b ) , but this discrepancy can be fully accounted for by the finite mw power used in this experiment ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> the observed correlations thus arise from imperfect manipulation rather than measurement crosstalk . in the other direction , however , true measurement crosstalk appears : nuclear rabi oscillation amplitudes decrease when the electronic spin is measured to be in @xmath6 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig4]c ) because optical excitation during electronic spin readout ( which only succeeds for @xmath6 ) induces nuclear spin relaxation ( see supplementary information for details ) . </S>",
    "<S> this effect can be mitigated by improving the collection efficiency ( thus reducing the readout duration ) , e.g. by integrating the nv centre in an optical cavity . </S>",
    "<S> also , application of moderate magnetic fields can cut the optically - induced nuclear spin relaxation rate by orders of magnitude  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results have implications for a broad range of spin - based applications . </S>",
    "<S> single - shot electron spin readout can drastically improve nv - based sensors by enabling fast , quantum projection limited detection , creating opportunities in low - temperature magnetometry  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> extension of nuclear spin preparation techniques to remote nuclei in the spin bath may permit line - narrowing for enhanced sensitivity to d.c . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic fields . furthermore , preparation , manipulation , and single - shot readout of two spins open the door to exploration of two - particle quantum correlations , such as bell s inequalities , and elementary quantum information processing protocols . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the techniques we describe are extendable to larger spin registers , and can be combined with precise spin qubit control and dynamical decoupling for coherence protection  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the preparation and readout fidelities reported here are sufficient for demonstrating measurement - based entanglement generation and quantum teleportation of spin qubits , and exploring elementary quantum error correction schemes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ultimately , integration of multi - spin registers with quantum optical channels via spin - photon entanglement  @xcite may enable their application as few - qubit nodes in long - distance quantum communication protocols or distributed quantum information processing networks . </S>"
