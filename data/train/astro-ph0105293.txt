    "the existence of an intense ultraviolet background ( uvb ) radiation , inferred from observations of qso absorption spectra ( gunn & peterson 1965 ; bajtlik , duncan & ostriker 1988 ) , is likely to have prominent impacts on galaxy formation . while its origin could be attributed to qsos or young galaxies appeared at high redshifts ( e.g. , couchman 1985 ; miralda - escude & ostriker 1990 ; sasaki & takahara 1994 ; fukugita & kawasaki 1994 ) , the uvb once produced photoionizes the intergalactic medium and alters the subsequent growth of cosmic structures .",
    "these secondary structures emerged in the uvb are further responsible for producing the radiation field , which can in turn affect the development of next generation objects .",
    "it is therefore crucial to determine quantitatively the consequences of radiative feedback on the formation of early generation ( hereafter population iii ) objects , in order to link the build - up of structures with the thermal history of the universe .",
    "it has long been suggested that the formation of subgalactic objects is suppressed via photoionization and heating caused by the uvb ( umemura & ikeuchi 1984 ; ikeuchi 1986 ; rees 1986 ; bond , szalay & silk 1988 ; efstathiou 1992 ; babul & rees 1992 ; murakami & ikeuchi 1993 ; chiba & nath 1994 ; zhang , anninos & norman 1995 ; thoul & weinberg 1996 , among others ) .",
    "most of previous studies , however , assumed for simplicity that the medium is optically thin against the external radiation .",
    "several attempts have been made recently to take into account radiative transfer of photons ( e.g. , kepner , babul & spergel 1997 ; tajiri & umemura 1998 ; abel , norman & madau 1999 ; barkana & loeb 1999 ; razoumov & scott 1999 ; gnedin 2000b ; susa & umemura 2000a ; nakamoto , umemura & susa 2001 ; ciardi et al",
    ". 2001 ) . in our previous papers ( kitayama & ikeuchi 2000 , hereafter paper i ; kitayama et al .",
    "2000 , hereafter paper ii ) , we have studied the evolution of spherical clouds exposed to the uvb , solving explicitly radiative transfer of ionizing photons and hydrodynamics .",
    "we have found that the collapse of objects with circular velocities below @xmath8 km s@xmath9 can be prohibited completely even if self - shielding of gas is taken into account . we have also noted that a spherical cloud above this threshold undergoes run - away collapse in the dark matter potential and does not settle into hydrostatic equilibrium . for plausible intensities and spectra of the uvb , the central region of such a cloud",
    "is shown to get self - shielded against photoionization before shrinking to the rotation barrier .",
    "a question still remains as to whether star formation can take place efficiently in the cloud collapsing under the uvb .",
    "a key element in this context is molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath0 ) . in order for stars to form",
    ", the gas needs to radiate energy efficiently and cool down to temperatures well below @xmath10k . in the gas of primordial composition without metals , cooling processes at this temperature",
    "are almost solely dominated by rotational - vibrational line excitation of h@xmath0 ( e.g. , peebles & dicke 1968 ; hirasawa 1969 ; matsuda , sato & takeda 1969 ) .",
    "formation and destruction of h@xmath0 , however , are very sensitive to the presence of a radiation field . for instance , h@xmath0 molecules are easily dissociated by photons in the so - called lyman - werner ( lw , 11.213.6 ev ) bands ( stecher & williams 1967 ; haiman , rees & loeb 1997 ; ciardi et al 2000b ) or via collisions with ions . on the other hand , the gas - phase formation of h@xmath0 is promoted by an enhanced ionized fraction in the post - shock gas ( shapiro & kang 1987 ; kang & shapiro 1992 ) or in weakly photoionized media ( haiman , rees & loeb 1996b ) . in addition , self - shielding taking place during dynamical collapse can also aid h@xmath0 cooling ( susa & kitayama 2000 ) .",
    "it is thus by no means trivial in what circumstances the uvb has positive or negative feedback on star formation in population iii objects .    in this paper , by including h@xmath0 chemistry consistently with radiative transfer of uv photons , we extend our previous analyses ( papers i and ii ) and study the fate of population iii objects exposed to the external uvb . assuming spherical symmetry , we solve the radiative transfer equation , non - equilibrium chemical reactions including h@xmath0 formation and destruction , and dynamics of baryonic gas and dark matter .",
    "particular attention is paid to the possibilities of both collapse and h@xmath0 cooling in the presence of uv radiation fields .",
    "we explore the evolution of objects with wide ranges of masses , including those with the virial temperature @xmath11k ( @xmath12 km s@xmath9 ) , which have been left out in our previous analyses neglecting h@xmath0 formation .",
    "a similar problem was investigated earlier by kepner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and haiman , abel & rees ( 2000 ) , assuming that collapsed clouds are in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "as mentioned above and shown explicitly in this paper , the gas in collapsed objects is far from static and its physical state changes highly dynamically .",
    "we also note that our analysis is complementary to that of susa & umemura ( 2000a , b ) , who explored the pregalactic pancake collapse in plane - parallel geometry and studied the fate of objects far above the jeans scale .",
    "we pay particular attention to the development of smaller objects near the jeans scale , which are likely to evolve spherically to a first - order approximation .",
    "a crucial distinction between the earlier works and ours is that the gas density rises rapidly along with the spherical collapse , in proportion to the cube of scale length , providing greater chances of self - shielding and h@xmath0 cooling .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the numerical model used in the paper .",
    "we present the simulation results in section 3 and discuss their implications on galaxy formation in section 4 .",
    "finally , section 5 summarizes our conclusions . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume the density parameter @xmath13 , the cosmological constant @xmath14 , the hubble constant @xmath15/(100 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath16 , and the baryon density parameter @xmath17 .",
    "we simulate the evolution of a spherically symmetric cloud exposed to the external uvb .",
    "the cloud is a mixture of baryonic gas and dark matter with the mass ratio of @xmath18 .",
    "the basic equations are summarized in section 2.1 . of paper i. one modification",
    "is that the acceleration term due to the cosmological constant @xmath19 is added to the right hand side of momentum equations .",
    "they are solved with the second - order - accurate lagrangian finite - difference scheme described in bowers & wilson ( 1991 ) and thoul & weinberg ( 1995 ) .",
    "shocks are treated with an artificial tensor viscosity ( tscharnuter & winkler 1979 ) .",
    "the number of mass shells is @xmath20 for baryonic gas and @xmath21 for dark matter .",
    "our code reproduces accurately the similarity solutions for the adiabatic accretion of collisional gas and the pressureless collapse around a point - mass perturbation ( bertschinger 1985 ) .",
    "we have also checked that our results are essentially unchanged when the shell numbers are doubled or halved .    at each time - step of the simulation , we solve self - consistently the radiative transfer equation , chemical reactions , and energy equation in the following three steps . repeating these procedures , the radiation field and the internal state of the gas are determined iteratively until the abundance of each species and the internal energy in each mesh converge within an accuracy of 0.1% .",
    "first , the direction / frequency - dependent radiative transfer is worked out for ionizing photons with energies @xmath22 ev , with the method devised by tajiri & umemura ( 1998 ) , in which both absorption and emission by hydrogen are explicitly taken into account . at each radial point , angular integration of the transfer equation is done over at least 20 bins in @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the angle between the light ray and the radial direction .",
    "this is achieved by handling 4001,000 impact parameters for light rays .",
    "self - shielding of h@xmath0 against the lw photons ( 11.213.6 ev ) is evaluated from the self - shielding function of draine & beltoldi ( 1996 ) , considering the direction dependence of the h@xmath0 column density as in kepner et al .",
    "the gas is assumed to be optically thin against the photons with @xmath25ev , which only contribute to destructions of h@xmath26 and h@xmath27 .",
    "secondly , non - equilibrium chemical reactions are solved in each mesh for the species e , h , h@xmath28 , h@xmath26 , h@xmath0 , h@xmath27 .",
    "hydrogen molecules form mainly via the creation of the intermediates h@xmath26 and h@xmath27 ( eqs [ 1.1][1.4 ] of shapiro & kang 1987 ) .",
    "we neglect helium for the following reasons : ( i ) it only changes the ionization degree of the gas up to @xmath29 ( osterbrock 1989 ; susa & umemura 2000a ) ; ( ii ) helium line cooling is unimportant at the typical temperatures ( @xmath30k ) of the objects presently studied ; and ( iii ) photoionization heating of helium does not alter our main results as discussed in section [ sec : signif ] .",
    "unless stated explicitly , reaction rates are taken from the recent compilation of galli & palla ( 1998 ) .",
    "the coefficients for photoionization of h and photodissociation of h@xmath0 are computed from the results of the radiative transfer mentioned above .",
    "photodetachment of h@xmath26 and photodissociation of h@xmath27 are also taken into account using the cross sections given in tegmark et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and stancil ( 1994 ) for the photons with @xmath31 ev and @xmath32 ev , respectively .",
    "these two processes , particularly the former , can suppress h@xmath0 formation by destroying its intermediates .",
    "finally , the energy equation is solved including uv heating and radiative cooling due to collisional ionization , collisional excitation , recombination , thermal bremsstrahlung , compton scattering with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , and rotational - vibrational excitation of h@xmath0 .",
    "the uv heating rate is obtained directly from the results of the radiative transfer .",
    "the atomic cooling rates are taken from fukugita & kawasaki ( 1994 ) and molecular cooling rates from galli & palla ( 1998 ) .",
    "for comparison with previous approaches , we also perform simpler calculations in the following two ways .",
    "one assumes at each time - step an optically thin medium and ionization equilibrium among e , h and h@xmath28 , neglecting h@xmath0 , h@xmath26 and h@xmath27 .",
    "the other solves radiative transfer of ionizing photons , but neglects h@xmath0 , h@xmath26 and h@xmath27 .",
    "the latter corresponds to the analysis of paper ii .",
    "hereafter we refer to the former as the ` optically thin calculation ' , the latter as the ` no h@xmath0 calculation ' , and the one described in the previous paragraphs as the ` full calculation ' . unless otherwise stated , the full calculation is adopted .",
    "the external uvb is assumed to be isotropic and to have either a power - law or black - body spectrum : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we adopt the spectral index @xmath35 and the effective temperature @xmath36k , to mimic the spectra of qsos and stars , respectively .",
    "the above spectrum is normalized to give the intensity @xmath37 , in units of @xmath38erg s@xmath9 @xmath39 str@xmath9 hz@xmath9 , at the lyman limit of hydrogen ( @xmath40ev ) .    fig .",
    "1 illustrates the model spectra described above with @xmath41 .",
    "also shown for reference are those with @xmath42 and @xmath43k . in the present analyses ,",
    "the ratio between the fluxes below and above the lyman limit is a key parameter to control the radiative feedback on the gas evolution ( e.g. , ciardi , ferrara & abel 2000a ) . to help quantitative comparisons among different spectral shapes , we list in table 1 the photon - number - weighted average intensities of these spectra : @xmath44 where the average is taken over the energies relevant for destruction of both h@xmath0 and h@xmath45 ( 0.7413.6 ev ) , dissociation of only h@xmath0 ( 11.213.6 ev ) , and ionization of h ( 13.6@xmath3 ev ) .",
    "notice that for a given value of @xmath37 the spectrum with @xmath36k has considerably less ionizing ( @xmath46ev ) photons and more h@xmath0 and h@xmath45 destroying photons ( @xmath47ev ) than the one with @xmath35 .",

    "and 2.4 . of paper i.",
    "in the following , we give their brief summary and state any modifications and additions .",
    "we start the simulations when the overdensity of a cloud is still in the linear regime .",
    "the initial overdensity profile for both baryon and dark matter is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the comoving wave number , and the central overdensity @xmath65 is fixed at 0.2 . only the growing mode is considered . the outer boundary is taken at the first minimum of @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath67 , within which the volume averaged overdensity @xmath68 vanishes .",
    "the characteristic mass of a cloud @xmath69 is defined as the baryon mass enclosed within the first zero of @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath70 , which is 0.363 of the total baryon mass ( haiman , thoul & loeb 1996a ) .",
    "we define the central collapse redshift @xmath71 and the cloud collapse redshift @xmath72 , respectively , as epochs at which the inner - most gas shell and the shell enclosing @xmath69 would collapse to the center in the absence of thermal pressure .",
    "these two redshifts are related by @xmath73 ( strictly speaking , this relation is correct in the einstein - de sitter universe , but it still gives a reasonable approximation in the present case at @xmath74 ) .",

    "we assume that the gas is in pressure equilibrium , i.e. , the pressure outside the cloud @xmath94 is equal to that of the outermost gas shell .",
    "this is different from the free boundary condition ( @xmath95 ) adopted in papers i and ii . while the inner structure of a simulated cloud is hardly affected by this difference , we adopt the former in this paper so that the cloud envelope maintains to follow the hubble expansion throughout its evolution .",
    "the results of the full calculations are first compared with those of previous approaches , to illustrate the significance of incorporating radiative transfer and h@xmath0 formation in our analyses .",

    "the external radiation is attenuated by absorption , but contraction of the gas is halted by thermal pressure as it lacks coolant at @xmath102k . in the full calculation , on the other hand , the cloud center is kept self - shielded against the uvb and h@xmath0 molecules in excess of @xmath103 are produced , allowing the gas to collapse and cool efficiently to @xmath104k .",
    "details of the h@xmath0 formation and destruction processes in the uvb will be discussed in section [ sec : dyn ] .    for a high mass object well above the scale @xmath105k , in contrast ,",
    "radiative transfer and h@xmath0 formation appear to have smaller impacts as far as the dynamics is concerned . fig .",
    "[ fig : rtxh ] shows that such a cloud can collapse even in a stronger uv field with @xmath41 and @xmath35 , regardless of treatments of radiative processes .",
    "this is because gravitational potential of the cloud is much greater than thermal energy attained by photoionization ( @xmath106k ) and atomic cooling is efficient enough to enable the collapse .",
    "nevertheless , the final thermal state of the gas is still modified to a great extent in a high mass collapse , as indicated by the differences in the temperature and electron fraction at the collapse in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtxh ] . to see this point more clearly ,",
    "[ fig : prof1 ] compares the internal structure of the same objects at the collapse of the central gas .",
    "the density profile commonly exhibits that the central gas is undergoing run - away collapse ( panel a ) , as it cools efficiently and contracts nearly at the free - fall rate under the dark matter potential .",
    "the radiative transfer effects , however , produce a self - shielded neutral region at @xmath107kpc ( panel b ) , whereas @xmath108 is simply determined by ionization equilibrium with uniform radiation in the optically thin case .",
    "the gas well inside this neutral region can cool down to @xmath109k once h@xmath0 cooling is taken into account ( panel c ) . in the absence of h@xmath0 molecules , the gas can cool only to @xmath110k by atomic cooling .",
    "rapid increase of density due to run - away collapse is in fact essential for self - shielding and h@xmath0 cooling , as will be discussed throughly in the forthcoming sections .    to further corroborate the above results , fig .",
    "[ fig : prof2 ] shows more detailed structures in the full calculation .",
    "while h@xmath0 molecules are destroyed in the ionized outer envelope , they form efficiently in the self - shielded central region ( panel a ) . roughly speaking",
    ", the gas becomes optically - thick against ionizing ( @xmath111ev ) photons at @xmath112 @xmath39 and the lw ( @xmath113ev ) photons at @xmath114 @xmath39 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are respectively the hi and h@xmath0 column densities measured from the outer boundary .",
    "both of these conditions are amply satisfied at @xmath117 kpc ( panel b ) . the uv heating rate is reduced significantly in this optically thick region ( panel c ) .",
    "photons emitted in the cloud interior contribute at most @xmath118 to the total heating rate for the @xmath35 spectrum , though their contribution can be much larger for a softer spectrum ( tajiri & umemura 2000 ) .",
    "cooling to temperatures below @xmath3k is possible once h@xmath0 cooling overtakes uv heating . at @xmath119k ( @xmath120 kpc ) ,",
    "the timescale of h@xmath0 formation becomes shorter than that of destruction as recombination lags behind the temperature decrease ( kang & shapiro 1992 ; corbelli , galli & palla 1997 ) , and chemical reactions are out of equilibrium ( panel d ) .",
    "the cooling timescale , however , becomes even shorter as temperature drops , and @xmath121 is frozen out at @xmath4 at the cloud center .",
    "this abundance is comparable to that achieved commonly in a metal - deficient post - shock layer in the absence of radiation ( shapiro & kang 1987 ; ferrara 1998 ; susa et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "if helium is further incorporated into the present calculations , the largest impact will be via heating by photons with @xmath122 ev . for given uv intensity @xmath37 , hi number density @xmath123 , and hi column density @xmath115",

    "these rates are computed as in the appendix of paper i , which are in good agreement with more rigorous treatment .",
    "equation ( [ eq : he ] ) indicates that the total heating rate tends to increase by @xmath128 once helium with the primordial abundance ( @xmath129 by number ) is taken into account .",

    "[ fig : prof2](c ) .",
    "in fact , we have checked that an additional heat input of @xmath130 does not considerably alter either the time evolutions in figs [ fig : rtxl ] and [ fig : rtxh ] or the internal structures in figs [ fig : prof1 ] and [ fig : prof2 ] .",
    "though temperature of the diffuse outer envelope can increase by as much as a factor of 2 by helium heating ( abel & haehnelt 1999 ) , the evolution of the central high - density region , in which our main interests reside , is little influenced .",
    "helium heating will be of less importance for softer spectra .",
    "hence we neglect helium in our analyses .    in summary ,",
    "the above results justify our present approach and confirm the importance of including radiative transfer of uv photons , h@xmath0 formation / destruction , and hydrodynamics , in studying the development of population iii objects in the uvb .",
    "the evolution of uv irradiated clouds are studied in more detail in the following .",
    "[ fig : rtxj ] displays how the time evolution of a low mass object ( @xmath99 km s@xmath9 ) depends on the radiation intensity . in the absence of the uvb ( @xmath131 ) , the cloud decoupled from the hubble expansion is first shock - heated and then cools radiatively . at @xmath132 , in contrast",
    ", the gas is photoionized and evaporated even if radiative transfer is taken into account .",
    "once the gas is photoionized and heated , h@xmath0 molecules are destroyed by a large amount . at lower intensity ( @xmath101 ) , as was also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtxl ] , the cloud can collapse and cool down by h@xmath0 . at even weaker intensity ( @xmath133 ) , the radiation is attenuated almost completely and the evolution resembles that in the no uv case .",
    "note that the h@xmath0 fraction increases after the onset of the uvb at @xmath101 , compared to the no uv case .",
    "this is indeed the case in which the formation of h@xmath0 via h@xmath26 and h@xmath27 is promoted by an enhanced ionized fraction in a weakly photoionized medium ( haiman et al .",
    "1996b ) .",
    "[ fig : rtxaj ] illustrates that the shape of the radiation spectrum also influences greatly the thermal and dynamical evolution .",
    "compared to the @xmath35 case , the black - body spectrum with @xmath134k is softer and has much less ionizing photons with energies above @xmath135ev ( see fig . 1 and table 1 ) . for the same values of @xmath37 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : rtxj ] , the black - body uvb therefore has weaker impacts on the evolution of radius , temperature , and the ionization degree . on the other hand , h@xmath0",

    ", the h@xmath0 fraction at the collapse again exceeds @xmath138 .    to illustrate more clearly how self - shielding and radiative cooling operate in a collapsing cloud , we plot in figs [ fig : core1 ] and [ fig : core2 ] the temperature and fractions of hi and h@xmath0 at the cloud center as a function of its density . as the gas contracts and density rises , its state changes rather suddenly from the hot ( @xmath139k ) ionized",
    "` hii phase ' , to the warm ( @xmath140k ) neutral ` hi phase ' , and the cold ( @xmath102k ) neutral ` h@xmath0 phase ' .",

    "what follows , we regard the gas as in the hii , hi , and h@xmath0 phases , if the density is in the range @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "though fig .",
    "[ fig : nj ] is plotted for particular choices of @xmath75 and @xmath72 , basic features are similar in other cases .",
    "a possible change is that for smaller masses and large @xmath37 the collapse is completely prohibited ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : jv ] ) and the critical densities simply disappear .    fig .",
    "[ fig : nj ] shows that @xmath141 increases with @xmath37 for a given spectral shape , i.e. , the higher density is required to shield the stronger ionizing flux . at small @xmath37",
    ", @xmath141 falls below the turn - around density , indicating that photoionization is kept attenuated throughout the cloud evolution .",
    "this feature is also apparent in figs [ fig : core1 ] and [ fig : core2 ] , in which @xmath108 is kept high at weak uv intensities .",
    "compared to the @xmath35 case , the @xmath36k spectrum yields lower values of @xmath141 , because there are less ionizing ( @xmath146 ev ) photons for a given @xmath37 .    on the other hand",
    ", @xmath147 behaves in a more complex manner , depending on the spectral shape . for @xmath35 ,",
    "it is not a monotonic function of @xmath37 , but has a minimum at moderate intensities @xmath148 .",
    "formation of h@xmath0 molecules is enhanced maximally at these intensities . at weaker intensities @xmath149 the result",
    "almost coincides with that of the no uv case , whereas at stronger intensities @xmath150 h@xmath0 formation is suppressed to higher densities . for @xmath36k , in contrast , a greater fraction of photons below 13.6 ev is present to suppress h@xmath0 formation .",
    "the threshold @xmath142 is therefore higher than that of @xmath35 for a given @xmath37 .",
    "this is the reason why the convergence of @xmath121 is rather slow in fig .",
    "[ fig : core2 ] . in either case ,",
    "[ fig : nj ] assures that the h@xmath0 phase is realized at the center of a contracting cloud before it is rotationally supported , as long as @xmath37 is not far above the level @xmath151 observed at @xmath152 .    the above critical densities @xmath141 and @xmath147 at @xmath153 with @xmath35 are in rough agreement with analytical estimations by tajiri & umemura ( 2000 ) for an isothermal sphere ; @xmath154 .",
    "this confirms , in the case of @xmath35 , that @xmath155 is essentially the density at which the number of recombinations in a cloud exceeds that of ionizing photons .",
    "similarly , @xmath147 at @xmath153 corresponds to the density at which the h@xmath0 cooling rate overcomes the uv heating rate attenuated at the cloud center . for a much softer spectrum ( @xmath36k ) ,",
    "the deviations from such simplified estimations become larger , because of the greater significance of emitted photons and the lw photons .",
    "we have performed the simulations for a variety of parameters , such as the intensity and spectrum of the uvb , and the circular velocity and collapse redshift of a cloud .",
    "the results are summarized in the following .",
    "[ fig : jv ] shows a @xmath156 diagram on collapse and cooling of a cloud with @xmath157 ( @xmath98 ) .",
    "the final state of the central gas is classified into three categories : ( i ) it collapses and cools to @xmath158k , i.e. the h@xmath0 phase is realized ; ( ii ) it collapses but does not cool to @xmath159k ; and ( iii ) it is prohibited to collapse within the present age of the universe .",
    "also plotted for reference is the relation @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the maximum equilibrium temperature defined semi - analytically in section 3.3 of paper ii .",
    "this relation roughly corresponds to the jeans condition at the maximum expansion of the central gas and provides a reasonable estimation for the collapse threshold in the optically thin limit .",
    "the predictions of the full calculations are distinct from the optically thin results in two ways .",
    "one is that the collapse of low mass objects with @xmath96k ( @xmath12 km s@xmath9 ) is possible at small uv intensities .",
    "the other is that the central gas in collapsed clouds can cool efficiently to temperatures well below @xmath3k , as long as @xmath37 is not far above the observed level @xmath151 .",
    "the suppression of h@xmath0 cooling occurs at @xmath162 for @xmath35 and @xmath163 for @xmath134k , mainly due to photodetachment of h@xmath26 as well as photodissociation of h@xmath0 . to quantify this effect ,",
    "we indicate in fig .",
    "[ fig : jv ] the average intensity of the external uvb defined by equation ( [ eq : jb ] ) at 0.7413.6 ev .",
    "the suppression of h@xmath0 cooling is shown to take place at @xmath164 in massive clouds for both spectra .    given circular velocity and collapse redshift of a cloud , one can compute the critical radiation intensity for collapse and h@xmath0 cooling .",
    "[ fig : jcrit ] exhibits , as a function of the central collapse redshift @xmath165 , the intensity above which h@xmath0 cooling is prevented completely in a cloud , i.e. , the final state of the central gas belongs to the category ( ii ) or ( iii ) defined above .",
    "the critical intensity is in general an increasing function of redshift , i.e. , gas density .",
    "it also increases with circular velocity but converges at @xmath166 km s@xmath9 and @xmath167 km s@xmath9 for @xmath35 and @xmath168k , respectively",
    ". the convergence takes place once photoheating no longer affects the cloud evolution and only photodestruction of h@xmath0 and h@xmath26 becomes important .",
    "the converged intensities therefore have nearly identical average values below the lyman limit @xmath169 for both spectra",
    ". once converged , the critical intensities tend to drop slightly for larger @xmath75 ( panel b ) because the electron fraction of the gas is lower in a cloud with higher hydrogen column densities .    to explore the possibilities of different epochs of reionization",
    ", we have added to fig .",
    "[ fig : jcrit ] the results of runs with @xmath170 and 50 .",
    "if @xmath165 is sufficiently close to @xmath171 , the central gas is already contracting when it is exposed to the uvb , and hence the stronger intensity is required to prevent collapse and cooling .",
    "the difference is greater for the harder spectrum and the smaller cloud mass , for which suppression of cooling is mainly via photoevaporation and depends highly on the initial dynamical state of the gas . for the softer spectrum and the larger cloud mass ,",
    "on the other hand , the suppression is regulated to a greater extent by photodestruction of h@xmath0 and h@xmath26 , and is less sensitive to the initial dynamical state .",
    "after all , fig .",
    "[ fig : jcrit ] indicates that there is a greater chance for the gas to cool even in a cloud well below the scale @xmath172 km s@xmath9 at high redshifts , provided that the intensity is comparable to or less than @xmath173 .",
    "alternatively , given a specific model on the evolution of the uvb , one can deduce the critical circular velocity or mass for collapse and cooling .",
    "[ fig : vz ] shows such quantities under which h@xmath0 cooling is completely suppressed in an object with the cloud collapse epoch @xmath72 .",
    "the uvb greatly prohibits cooling in clouds with @xmath174 km s@xmath9 or @xmath175 at low redshifts .",
    "the threshold values , however , depend highly on the time history and spectra of the uvb . for an evolutionary model given by equation ( [ eq : uvevl ] ) , the critical mass drops by several orders of magnitude at @xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) , enabling cooling in objects as small as @xmath178 .",
    "[ fig : vz](b ) also exhibits the mass and collapse redshift of the 1,2,3@xmath7 density perturbations in a cold dark matter ( cdm ) model with @xmath179 .",
    "this is a specific example of the most successful cosmological model which is consistent with a number of current observations ( e.g. , wang et al . 2000 ) .",
    "[ fig : vz ] shows that the uvb mainly suppresses collapse and cooling of @xmath180 objects with @xmath175 in the @xmath181cdm model .",
    "it is rather difficult to suppress cooling in higher-@xmath7 objects , unless the radiation intensity becomes much higher than the level observed at @xmath152 .",
    "if different values of cosmological parameters are adopted , the collapse criterion in terms of circular velocity remains practically unchanged as long as @xmath182 .",
    "thus , the critical mass shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vz](b ) scales with cosmological parameters merely according to equation ( [ eq : vc ] ) .",
    "our calculations predict that the formation of objects with @xmath183 km s@xmath9 is greatly suppressed by the uvb at low redshifts , whereas much smaller objects ( @xmath184k , @xmath185 km s@xmath9 ) can collapse and cool at high redshifts ( @xmath176 , @xmath177 ) .",
    "this is mainly because of three reasons : ( i ) intensity of the uvb tends to decline at high redshifts prior to complete reionization of the universe ; ( ii ) self - shielding of the gas is stronger at higher redshifts owing to higher gas density ; and ( iii ) the gas density in jeans unstable clouds rises rapidly along with run - away collapse , further promoting self - shielding and h@xmath0 formation .",
    "what are the fates of low mass objects that are able to cool and collapse in the presence of the uvb ?",
    "if the cooled gas can promptly turn into stars , they are likely to constitute ` building blocks ' of present - day luminous structures .",
    "while such objects may be detected directly by future instruments such as _ ngst _ , they may also have links to observed subgalactic objects ( e.g. , pascarelle et al .",
    "1996 ) or dwarf galaxies .",
    "in contrast , those prevented to collapse by the uvb will become gravitationally unbound and spread into intergalactic medium .",
    "they might contribute to ly@xmath53 absorption lines in the qso spectra ( e.g. , umemura & ikeuchi 1984 ) .",
    "these speculations on the bifurcation of low mass objects are illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : mbif ] .",
    "the critical baryonic mass in the case of evolving @xmath37 ( eq .  [ [ eq : uvevl ] ] ) with @xmath35 is used to distinguish the uncollapsed ` expanding clouds ' from the others .",
    "furthermore , we expect that the collapsed objects may be identified , mainly based on their distinct star formation histories , as at least two separate populations : the lower - mass ( @xmath186 ) , higher-@xmath7 ( @xmath187 ) systems and the higher - mass , lower-@xmath7 ones .",
    "the former population can be a plausible candidate of dwarf spheroidal / elliptical galaxies for the following reasons .",
    "first , star formation in these objects is expected to be active at redshifts higher than @xmath188 , consistent with the fact that the majority of local group dwarfs show a sharp decline in the star formation rate at some @xmath189 gyr ago ( mateo 1998 ; gnedin 2000a ) .",
    "second , their gravitational potential is compatible with small velocity dispersions ( @xmath190 km s@xmath9 ) of local group dwarfs .",
    "third , they are apt to be dark matter dominated and metal - poor since the gas infall and star formation are suppressed particularly at the outer envelope .",
    "fourth , our simulations indicate that the central gas in these objects can cool efficiently by h@xmath0 in the course of spherical contraction before reaching the rotation barrier .",
    "galaxy formation is thus likely to proceed rapidly in a dissipationless manner and lead to the formation of spheroids rather than disks .    on the other hand",
    ", the latter population will exhibit signs of more recent star formation and contribute significantly to the global star formation rate of the universe .",
    "the clustering of these low @xmath7 objects is expected to be rather weak .",
    "they might thus have been identified as a part of faint blue objects ( e.g. , tyson 1988 ; cowie et al .",
    "1988 ; ellis 1997 ) or star - forming dwarfs ( e.g. , thuan & martin 1981 ; lee et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this is in line with the idea proposed by babul & rees ( 1992 ) and extended by babul & ferguson ( 1996 ) and kepner et al .",
    "one distinction is that the impacts of the decline of the uv intensity at low redshifts turn out to be modest .",
    "this is because the collapse is delayed by the kinetic energy of the gas attained during the peak of the uv intensity at @xmath191 ( although the threshold circular velocity does decrease with time , the threshold mass continues to rise due to a factor @xmath192^{-3/2}$ ] ) .",
    "the present spherical collapse simulations are mainly applicable to low mass objects near the jeans scale .",
    "much larger objects , in contrast , are likely to first undergo sheet - like pancake collapse and evolve in a different manner from the spherical case . they would not end up with the run - away collapse as gravity of the sheet",
    "is readily overwhelmed by thermal pressure .",
    "in fact , susa & umemura ( 2000a , b ) argued that the pancakes collapsing in the uvb can bifurcate , depending upon the degree of self - shielding , into observed early and late type galaxies .",
    "both their results and ours suggest that the uvb could play an essential role in regulating the star formation history of the universe .",
    "recent three - dimensional simulations show that a number of subclumps tend to arise from the fragmentation process in a parent cloud ( e.g. , bromm , coppi & larson 1999 ; abel , bryan & norman 2000 ) .",
    "the criteria obtained in the current calculations are applicable to each of such locally collapsing subclumps . as a net effect to the parent cloud ,",
    "the gas clumpiness is likely to enhance self - shielding against the external uvb , since the number of photons necessary to ionize the gas increases roughly by a factor @xmath193 ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; ciardi et al .",
    "2000b ) .",
    "major uncertainties in our predictions are regarding the feedback from the sources formed in an collapsing object .",
    "while our simulations can probe directly the cloud evolution until its central collapse , the evolution thereafter will be influenced by several additional processes .",
    "for instance , omukai & nishi ( 1999 ) argued that even a single ob star can photodissociate surrounding hydrogen molecules within a static cloud with @xmath184k . on the other hand ,",
    "ferrara ( 1998 ) pointed out that blow - away processes during supernova explosions can enhance the fraction of hydrogen molecules in surrounding media .",
    "such explosions may also disrupt low mass objects and induce metal injections into intergalactic space ( e.g. , dekel & silk 1986 ; nishi & susa 1999 ; ferrara & tolstoy 2000 ) .",
    "it still remains uncertain to what extent these processes affect successive gas infall and cooling in a dynamically contracting object whose central overdensity exceeds @xmath92 .",
    "as this issue is beyond the scope of the present paper , we will investigate it separately in our future publications .",
    "we have studied the formation of population iii objects exposed to the external uv radiation .",
    "radiative transfer of photons , h@xmath0 formation and destruction processes , and hydrodynamics are incorporated explicitly in our analyses and all shown to play essential roles in the development of population iii objects .",
    "although the uvb does suppress the formation of low mass objects , the negative feedback turns out to be weaker than previously suggested in the following two respects .",
    "first , the cut - off scale of the collapse drops significantly below @xmath194k ( @xmath195 km s@xmath9 ) at weak uv intensities ( @xmath2 ) , due to both self - shielding of the gas and h@xmath0 cooling .",
    "their importance becomes greater at higher redshifts . at stronger intensities",
    ", objects as large as @xmath196 km s@xmath9 can be photoevaporated and prohibited to collapse , in agreement with previous investigations based on the optically thin approximation ( e.g. , thoul & weinberg 1996 ) .",
    "high mass objects well above this scale can collapse almost irrespectively of the uvb by atomic cooling .",
    "secondly , a spherical cloud that has become jeans unstable in the uvb tends to undergo run - away collapse and does not settle into hydrostatic equilibrium . as a result ,",
    "even if the gas is ionized and/or h@xmath0 molecules are destroyed once by radiation at low densities ( e.g. , haiman et al . 2000 ) , the radiation is attenuated and h@xmath0 can re - form during the dynamical collapse .",
    "the critical densities at which self - shielding and efficient h@xmath0 cooling take place depend sensitively on the spectrum and intensity of the external uvb . for a qso - like ( @xmath35 )",
    "spectrum , h@xmath0 formation is even enhanced by a little radiation with @xmath148 ( haiman et al .",
    "1996b ) . for a stellar - like ( @xmath36k ) spectrum ,",
    "h@xmath0 formation is hindered to a greater extent by the photons with energies below 13.6 ev ( haiman et al .",
    "1997 ) . in any case",
    ", the collapsing gas is shown to cool efficiently to temperatures well below @xmath3 k before rotationally supported , as long as the radiation intensity is comparable to or less than @xmath197 observed at @xmath152 .",
    "the h@xmath0 fraction in the cooled gas reaches the level @xmath4 , comparable to that achieved commonly in the metal - deficient post - shock layer ( shapiro & kang 1987 ; ferrara 1998 ; susa et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "our results imply that star formation can take place in low mass objects collapsing in the uvb .",
    "the threshold baryon mass for the complete suppression of collapse and star formation is @xmath198 at @xmath199 but drops significantly at higher redshifts . in a conventional @xmath181cdm universe ,",
    "it coincides roughly with that of the 1@xmath7 density fluctuations at @xmath176 .",
    "objects near and above this threshold can thus constitute building blocks of present - day luminous structures , and may also have links to dwarf spheroidal / elliptical galaxies and faint blue objects .",
    "these results indicate that the uvb can play a key role in regulating the star formation history of the universe .",

    "<S> in particular , the cut - off scale of collapse drops significantly below the virial temperature @xmath1k at weak uv intensities ( @xmath2 ) , due to both self - shielding of the gas and h@xmath0 cooling . </S>",
    "<S> clouds above this cut - off tend to contract highly dynamically , further promoting self - shielding and h@xmath0 formation . for plausible radiation intensities and spectra </S>",
    "<S> , the collapsing gas can cool efficiently to temperatures well below @xmath3k before rotationally supported and the final h@xmath0 fraction reaches @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that star formation can take place in low mass objects collapsing in the uvb . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold baryon mass for star formation is @xmath5 for clouds collapsing at redshifts @xmath6 , but drops significantly at higher redshifts . in a conventional cold dark matter universe , </S>",
    "<S> the latter coincides roughly with that of the 1@xmath7 density fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> objects near and above this threshold can thus constitute ` building blocks ' of luminous structures , and we discuss their links to dwarf spheroidal / elliptical galaxies and faint blue objects . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the uvb can play a key role in regulating the star formation history of the universe .    </S>",
