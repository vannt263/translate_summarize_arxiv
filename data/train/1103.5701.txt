    "one well - known success of the constituent quark model ( cqm ) is its prediction of the low - mass baryon magnetic moments , using just the su(6 ) wavefunctions @xcite .",
    "calculations of the magnetic moments @xcite , assuming that quarks behave as point - like dirac dipoles , are typically within @xmath510% of the current measured values @xcite . however , today we know that the spin of the proton is much more complex than the cqm representation , with only about one - third of the proton s spin coming from the quarks and the rest of the spin resulting from a combination of the gluon spins and the orbital angular momentum of the quarks @xcite .",
    "clearly , the cqm is an over - simplification of the spin dynamics inside baryons , yet somehow the cqm captures the degrees of freedom that are relevant to the measured magnetic moments .",
    "further measurements of baryon magnetic moments , utilizing the electromagnetic decays of excited baryons , will continue to test our understanding of baryon wavefunctions .    experimentally , it is difficult to measure the electromagnetic ( em ) transitions of decuplet - to - octet baryons because of the competition between em and strong decays .",
    "for example , the branching ratio for em decay of the @xmath6 resonance has been measured to be about 0.55% @xcite and branching ratios for other decuplet baryons are predicted to be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the em transition form factors for the @xmath6 may be directly measured via pion photoproduction @xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that pion cloud effects contribute significantly ( @xmath540% ) to the @xmath7 magnetic dipole transition form factor , @xmath8 , at low @xmath9 ( below @xmath10 gev@xmath11 ) . in the naive non - relativistic quark model @xcite , the value of @xmath12 is directly proportional to the proton magnetic moment , and measurements of @xmath13 near @xmath14 can only be explained ( within this quark model ) if the experimental magnetic moment is lowered by about 30% .",
    "this again suggests that the cqm is an over - simplification of reality .    to extend these measurements to the other decuplet baryons , which have non - zero strangeness",
    ", hyperons must be produced through strangeness - conserving reactions .",
    "then their em decay , which has a small branching ratio , must be measured directly .",
    "although these measurements are difficult , it is important to measure the em decays of strange baryons to extract information on their wavefunctions , which in turn , constrains theoretical models of baryon structure .",
    "the measurements of em transition form factors for decuplet baryons with strangeness may also be sensitive to meson cloud effects . a comparison of the em decay measurements to predictions of quark models for decay of decuplet hyperons , @xmath15 , to octet hyperons , @xmath16 , can provide a measure of the importance of meson cloud diagrams in the @xmath17 transition .",
    "here , we present measurements of the em decay @xmath18 normalized to the strong decay @xmath19 . the present results can be compared to previous measurements of the @xmath20 em decay @xcite ( also from clas data ) that had a larger uncertainty ( @xmath525% statistical and @xmath515% systematic uncertainty ) .",
    "the smaller uncertainties here are due to a larger data set ( more than 10 times bigger ) and , subsequently , better control over systematic uncertainties .",
    "the reduced uncertainty is important because , as mentioned above , meson cloud effects are predicted to be on the order of @xmath530 - 40% . in order to quantify the effect of meson clouds for baryons with non - zero strangeness ,",
    "it is desirable to keep measurement uncertainties below @xmath510% .    [",

    "since the kinematic fit requires a constraint on the @xmath22 mass , the kinematic cut on the invariant mass of the @xmath23 has no effect .",

    "\\label{ratt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    previously published work @xcite on this branching ratio yielded a ratio of @xmath25 % .",
    "the value given here is consistent within uncertainties of the previous value , but has smaller uncertainties .",
    "the smaller uncertainty is important , as the previous uncertainty was on the same order as the theoretical meson cloud corrections to the em decay of the @xmath6 .",
    "if similar meson cloud corrections are to be proven true for em decay of the @xmath20 baryon , then the smaller experimental uncertainty is a significant improvement .",
    "the width for the branching ratio achieved comes from the use of the full width of the @xmath20 , which is @xmath26 mev with the branching ratio that the radiative signal is being normalized to , which is the @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the partial width calculation is then @xmath28 where a systematic uncertanty in @xmath29 of @xmath30 is use in combination with the statistical uncertainty .",
    "note that a large part of the uncertainty in eq .",
    "( [ width ] ) comes from the uncertainty of the full width @xmath31 .",
    "these results verify that the partial width is indeed significantly larger than leading theoretical predictions , indicating that meson cloud effects are an important consideration for future calculations .",
    "the radiative decay @xmath32 is made up of m1 and e2 electromagnetic transitions . assuming that the e2 amplitude is very small",
    ", one can calculate the transition magnetic moment from the measured radiative width @xcite , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the photon momentum , @xmath35 is the mass of the proton , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the nuclear magneton . the value for the transition magnetic moment is larger than most model predictions even within the experimental uncertainty . for example",
    "the naive quark model predicts @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "we hope that this measurement , along with others to come , will motivate theorists to understand the effect of the meson cloud on the magnetic moment and hence extend our knowledge of the quark wavefunctions in the decuplet baryons .",
