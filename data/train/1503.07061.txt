    "the rigorous derivation of effective non - linear theories from many - body quantum mechanics has been studied extensively in recent years , motivated in part by experiments in cold atom physics . for bosons ,",
    "the emergence of the limit theories can be interpreted as due to most of the particles occupying the same quantum state : this is the bose - einstein condensation phenomenon , observed first in dilute alkali vapors some twenty years ago .",
    "the parameter regime most relevant for the description of the actual physical setup is the gross - pitaevskii limit .",
    "it is also the most mathematically demanding regime considered in the literature so far , see  @xcite for the derivation of equilibrium states and  @xcite for dynamics ( more extensive lists of references may be found in  @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason for this sophistication is the fact that interparticle correlations due to two - body scattering play a leading order role in this regime .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present a method for the derivation of gross - pitaevskii theory at the level of the ground state that is conceptually and technically simpler than existing proofs , in particular that of  @xcite which was so far the only method applicable when an external magnetic field is present .",
    "our setting is as follows : we consider @xmath0 interacting bosons in the three - dimensional space @xmath1 , described by the many - body schrdinger hamiltonian @xmath2 acting on the space @xmath3 of permutation - symmetric square integrable functions .",
    "the one - body operator is given by @xmath4 with a magnetic ( or a rotation ) field @xmath5 satisfying @xmath6 for some constant @xmath7 and an external potential @xmath8 satisfying @xmath9 we thus consider non - relativistic particles in a trapping potential , possibly under the influence of an effective magnetic field , which might be due to rotation of the sample or the interaction with optical fields .",
    "the particles interact pairwise via a repulsive potential @xmath10 given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a fixed function which is non - negative , radial and of finite range , i.e. , @xmath13 for some constant @xmath14 .",
    "different scalings of the interaction potential have been considered in the literature , of the form @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath17 prefactor makes the interaction energy in   of the same order as the one - particle energy . indeed , if @xmath18 , then @xmath19 weakly and thus the interaction potential @xmath20 should be thought of as leading to a bounded interaction energy per pair of particles . generally speaking ,",
    "the larger the parameter @xmath21 , the faster the potential converges to a point interaction , and thus the harder the analysis .",
    "note that the cases @xmath22 and @xmath23 correspond to two physically rather different scenarios : in the former the range of the potential is much larger than the typical interparticle distance @xmath24 and we should expect many weak collisions ; while in the latter we rather have very few but very strong collisions .",
    "in this paper we consider the most interesting case @xmath25 where the naive approximation does _ not _ capture the leading order behavior of the physical system .",
    "in fact , the strong correlations at short distances @xmath26 yield a nonlinear correction , which essentially amounts to replacing the coupling constant @xmath27 by @xmath28 the scattering length of @xmath12 .",
    "let us quickly recall the definition of the scattering length ; a more complete discussion can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix  c ) .",
    "under our assumption on @xmath12 , the zero - energy scattering equation @xmath29 has a unique solution and it satisfies @xmath30 for some constant @xmath31 which is called the _ scattering length _ of @xmath12 . in particular , if @xmath12 is the potential for hard spheres , namely @xmath32 when @xmath33 and @xmath34 when @xmath35 , then the scattering length of @xmath12 is exactly @xmath36 . in a dilute gas",
    ", the scattering length can be interpreted as an effective range of the interaction : a quantum particle far from the others is felt by them as a hard sphere of radius @xmath37",
    ". a useful variational characterization of @xmath37 is as follows : @xmath38 consequently , @xmath39 is smaller than @xmath27 ( the strict inequality can be seen by taking the trial function @xmath40 with @xmath41 satisfying @xmath42 when @xmath33 , and @xmath43 sufficiently small ) .",
    "moreover , a simple scaling shows that the scattering length of @xmath44 is @xmath45 .",
    "we are going to prove that the ground state energy and ground states of @xmath46 converge to those of the gross - pitaevskii functional @xmath47 in a suitable sense .",
    "note that the occurrence of the scattering length in is subtle : this functional is _ not _ obtained by testing @xmath46 with factorized states of the form @xmath48 ( which would lead to a functional with @xmath49 replaced by @xmath50 ) .",

    "in particular , if @xmath56 subject to @xmath61 has a unique minimizer @xmath62 has a unique minimizer @xmath62 ( up to a complex phase ) , then there is complete bose - einstein condensation @xmath63    the energy upper bound in was proved in @xcite ( see also  ( * ? ? ? *",
    "appendix  a ) for an alternative approach ) .",
    "the energy lower bound in and the convergence of one - particle density matrices were proved in @xcite .",
    "the simpler case @xmath64 had been treated before in  @xcite ( ground state energy ) and @xcite ( condensation ) . in this case , the uniqueness of the gross - pitaevskii minimizer @xmath62 follow from a simple convexity argument .",
    "the result in theorem [ thm : cv - gp ] is thus not new , but the existing proofs are fairly difficult , in particular that of  @xcite which deals with the case @xmath65 .    in the present paper",
    "we will provide alternative proofs of the energy lower bound and the convergence of states using the quantum de finetti theorem in the same spirit as in  @xcite .",
    "our proofs are conceptually and technically simpler than those provided in  @xcite",
    ". the overall strategy will be explained in the next section .",
    "our result covers the case of a rotating gas where the minimizers of the gp functional can develop quantized vortices .",
    "this corresponds to taking @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the angular velocity vector . in this case , @xmath8 should be interpreted as the trapping potential minus @xmath68 .",
    "the assumption @xmath69 as @xmath70 is to ensure that all particles are confined to the system . here our conditions on @xmath5 and @xmath8 are slightly more general than those of @xcite where @xmath5 is assumed to grow at most polynomially and @xmath8 is assumed to grow at least logarithmically .",
    "the finite range assumption on @xmath12 is not a serious restriction because we can always restrict the support of @xmath12 to a finite ball without changing the scattering length significantly .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to assume that @xmath12 is integrable at infinity , in which case the scattering length is well - defined .",
    "we can also work with a more general interaction @xmath71 ( with scattering length @xmath72 ) rather than the specific choice , as long as its range goes to zero and @xmath73 exists ; then the result in theorem [ thm : cv - gp ] still holds with @xmath37 replaced by @xmath73 . in particular , if @xmath10 is chosen as in   for some @xmath74 , then @xmath75 .",
    "the critical case @xmath76 considered in this paper is much more interesting because in the limit the true scattering length appears instead of its first order born approximation @xmath77 .",

    "the main difficulty in dealing with the gp limit is that an ansatz @xmath48 does _ not _ give the correct energy asymptotics . in this regime ,",

    "the following lemma , proved in  @xcite , allows to bound our hamiltonian from below by an effective one which is much less singular , but still encodes the scattering length of the original interaction potential .",
    "[ lem : dyson ] + for all @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , we have @xmath94 where @xmath95    here and in the sequel , @xmath96 stands for a generic positive constant .",

    "thus for every @xmath104 , @xmath105 multiplying both sides with @xmath106 and summing over @xmath107 we obtain .",
    "the reader should keep in mind that we will choose @xmath108 ( actually @xmath109 ) , then @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the main point of dyson s lemma is that we can replace the hard interaction potential @xmath10 by a softer one @xmath87 which encodes the scattering length conveniently as @xmath112 .",
    "the price we have to pay for this advantage is twofold , however : first , we have to use all the high - momentum part of the kinetic energy ( note that @xmath113 when @xmath114 ) ; and second , the new potential @xmath115 comes with the cut - off @xmath116 .",
    "together they really describe a ",
    "nearest neighbor \" potential instead of an ordinary two - body potential . while the first problem is not too annoying as the low part of the momentum is sufficient to recover the full energy in the limit , the second problem is much more serious",
    ".    * step 2 ( second moment estimate ) .",
    "* the lower bound leads us to consider the effective hamiltonian @xmath117 where @xmath118 here we use the freedom to add and remove the constant @xmath119 to the hamiltonian to reduce to the case @xmath120 . in order to ensure that @xmath121 is finite , we need the extra condition @xmath122 which can be removed at a later stage , as we shall explain below .",
    "we will now seek a lower bound to the ground state energy of  .",
    "the philosophy , as in the previous work  @xcite , is that if @xmath52 is the ground state of the original hamiltonian , then roughly @xmath123 where @xmath90 encodes the two - body scattering process and @xmath124 is a ground state for  .",
    "thus the dyson lemma allows to extract the short - range correlation structure and we now want to justify that @xmath124 can be approximated by a tensor power @xmath48 , that is , we want to justify the mean - field approximation at the level of the ground state of  .",
    "there are two key difficulties left :    * the effective hamiltonian is genuinely many - body . it can be bounded below by a three - body hamiltonian , but obviously one will ultimately have to show that the three - body contribution can be neglected . * to recover the correct energy in the limit we need to take @xmath125 in order to be able to neglect the three - body contribution in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we thus still have to deal with the mean - field approximation in the `` rare but strong collisions '' limit .",
    "in other words , even though the effective hamiltonian is much less singular than the original one , we do not have the freedom to reduce the singularity as much as we would like .",
    "it is in treating these two difficulties that our new method significantly departs from the previous works  @xcite .",
    "we shall rely on a strong a priori estimate for ground states of  . in lemma [ lem : a - priori - estimate ] , we assume and show that ( provided @xmath126 , which is sufficient for our purpose ) @xmath127 note that a bound of this kind is not available for the original @xmath46 due to the singularity of its interaction potential .",

    "this should be the case if @xmath88 is much smaller than @xmath141 , the average distance of particles , but it is rather difficult to confirm this intuition rigorously .    in @xcite ,",
    "a three - body estimate was established using a subtle argument based on path integrals ( the trotter product formula ) . in this paper",
