    "the liquid drop model is explicitly formulated by two phenomenological formulas , the weizscker formula [ 1 ] to calculate the nuclear binding energy and the formula @xmath1 to calculate the nuclear radii .",
    "it is known [ 2 ] that the idea of alpha clustering has developed together with the liquid drop model since the beginning of the nuclear physics .",
    "nowadays the alpha - cluster model is becoming more popular .",
    "recently it has been shown that a large body of data on the @xmath0-decay is described by a simple cluster model with using a notion of an @xmath0-core potential [ 3 ] .",
    "there are several attempts to incorporate the alpha - cluster model into the shell model [ 2,4 ] . to elucidate",
    "the optical potential in nucleus - nucleus collisions an idea of bigger clusters like nucleon molecules of @xmath2 has been used [ 5 ] .",
    "currently the idea of alpha - clustering is actively used in the microscopic studies of the nuclear structure of the light nuclei in the framework of the few - body approach [ 6 ] , as well as in the microscopic approaches to the effective nucleon - nucleon interaction [ 7 ] .",
    "also there have been some studies recently to apply an alpha - cluster model to facilitate the description of some characteristics of nuclei like the @xmath0-particle separation energy [ 8 ] and the nuclear radii [ 9 ] for a wide range of nuclei .",
    "there is another strong evidence in favor of an alpha - cluster model of nuclear structure .",
    "it comes from the recent findings [ 10,11 ] that the radii of nuclei can be described independently of the number of excess neutrons by the formula @xmath3 fm .",
    "it can be considered as a consequence of a well known fact that the charge density in nuclei is almost constant ( see , for example , table 3.7 [ 12 ] ) .    in this connection",
    "it is interesting to obtain the formulas to calculate the charge radii and binding energies of nuclei on the basis of the idea that the nuclear structure is defined by its elements , @xmath0-clusters .",
    "in such an approach , unlike the weizscker formula , the formula to calculate the nuclear binding energy should consist of two separate parts .",
    "one is responsible for the binding energy of @xmath0-clusters and the other should estimate the binding energy of excess neutrons .",
    "the core starts growing with @xmath4 from the nucleus with @xmath5 [ 10 ] together with the surface tension energy .",
    "the distance between the nearby clusters is determined by their charge radii , which are bigger than their matter radii .",
    "it was shown [ 10,11 ] that the @xmath6-stable nuclei have a particular number of excess neutrons needed to fill in the difference in the volumes occupied by the charge and the matter of the nucleons of the @xmath0-clusters in the core .",
    "then the radius @xmath7 of a @xmath6-stable isotope can be estimated by the volume occupied by the matter of the core and the volume of the charge of a few peripheral clusters .",
    "it has been shown that the condition @xmath8 determines the narrow @xmath6-stability path and its width .",
    "the binding energy of these excess neutrons can be calculated as a sum of the energies of @xmath9-pairs .",
    "the hypothesis that the @xmath9-pairs are placed in the core explains its high mass density .",
    "in addition , it provides an explanation [ 10 ] why the experimental values of the most abundant isotopes @xmath10 are well described by both functions , @xmath11 in the liquid drop model and @xmath12 in the @xmath0-cluster model .",
    "then it is expected that the nn - interaction in the regular @xmath0-cluster structure is different from that in excess neutron matter .",
    "it is approved by a recent investigation of the optical potential for the elastic channels in reaction @xmath13 [ 13 ] .",
    "it has been found that the projectile proton is involved in the nn - interactions in @xmath14 channel somewhat different from nn - interactions of the outgoing excess neutron in @xmath15 channel .",
    "the proton belongs to the @xmath0-cluster structure and the neutron is from the excess neutrons . to elucidate the isospin independence of nn - interactions between the nucleons of the @xmath0-cluster structure the same investigation",
    "should be done for the different reaction @xmath16 where the both proton and neutron belong to one @xmath17-pair .",
    "the energy of the short - range inter - cluster bonds @xmath18 is taken to be equal @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the nuclear force energy and @xmath21 denotes the coulomb repulsion energy between two nearby clusters .",
    "the old term nuclear force energy means here the energy of the attraction between nearby clusters due to the strong inter - nucleon potential .",
    "the values of @xmath22 mev , @xmath23 mev and @xmath24 mev have been found from analysis of the experimental data of the lightest nuclei with @xmath25 [ 14 ] under two assumptions that the proton - neutron ( @xmath17 ) pair interactions are responsible for the adherence between @xmath0-clusters and that the proton and the neutron belonging to one pair have equivalent single - particle nuclear bound state potentials , the epn requirement [ 14,15 ] .",
    "the latter allows one to take the difference between the single - particle binding energies of the proton and the neutron of the last pair @xmath26 as the coulomb energy of the proton s interaction with the other protons of the nucleus .",
    "it was shown [ 14,15 ] that the experimental binding energies @xmath27 of the @xmath0-cluster nuclei with @xmath28 , known for the nuclei with @xmath29 , are well described by the formula @xmath30 where @xmath31 mev .",

    "it must be compensated by its surface tension energy @xmath34 .",

    "the long - range part of the coulomb energy of the last cluster s interaction with @xmath40 remote clusters is well approximated by expression @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the radius of the last proton position in the nucleus .",

    "it is evident that the model can be applied only for the nuclei with the number of excess neutrons @xmath56 , so that every proton is coupled with a neutron .",
    "this set of nuclei includes all stable nuclei and the unstable nuclei around the @xmath6-stability path .",
    "the model has been developed for the last few years and the main formulas have been published [ 10,11,14,15,16,17 ] . in the most recent papers [ 16,17 ] the surface tension energy was calculated with using the empirical values of @xmath57 for @xmath29 , @xmath58 . in this paper",

    "therefore the last member in the sum ( 19 ) is taken equal to @xmath243 , and the value of @xmath244 is obtained from fitting the empirical values of @xmath239 . as a result ,",
    "one obtains an equation to calculate @xmath42 in dependence on @xmath50 only .",
    "@xmath245    the value of @xmath163 is calculated by the same formula with using @xmath246 instead of @xmath50 .",
    "the values of @xmath105 ( 21 ) have been used in ( 17)/(18 ) to estimate the values of @xmath26 for the nuclei with @xmath247 .",
    "the values are given in table 1 .",
    "the accuracy of several tenth mev is determined by the deviation between two possible ways to obtain @xmath26 by ( 17)/(18 ) or ( 19)/(20 ) .",
    "finally , the fourth way to calculate @xmath42 comes from the requirement that the surface tension energy is expected to be proportional to the number of clusters on the surface of the liquid drop @xmath248 , where @xmath249 mev is obtained by fitting the values of @xmath250 .",
    "the value is supposed to refer to the coulomb radius @xmath44 .",
    "therefore the equation is    @xmath251    for odd @xmath4 the value of @xmath154 is calculated by ( 22 ) with @xmath252 .",
    "the values @xmath105 obtained by different ways differ within 0.3 fm for the nuclei with @xmath253 .",
    "for the nuclei with @xmath254 the difference is bigger . for the nuclei with @xmath255 , @xmath256 , @xmath257 ( 21 ) .",
    "it was shown [ 10 ] that the formula to calculate the radii of nuclei @xmath258 successfully fits the experimental radii of the most abundant isotopes @xmath10 with three close values of @xmath259 . using the value of @xmath260 equal to @xmath261 fm [ 22 ] fits the radii of the nuclei with few clusters @xmath262 .",
    "there is no core in these nuclei . in the nuclei with @xmath263 , where the number of clusters in the core is comparable with the number of peripheral clusters , the value @xmath264 fm . in the nuclei with @xmath265 the radii @xmath10",
    "are well described by the radius @xmath266 fm , which is the radius of the clusters of the core [ 10 ] .    varying the number of the peripheral clusters from 1 to 4 ( or 5 ) in accordance with the comprehensive shell model is the point of the alpha - cluster shell model to calculate the root mean square radius @xmath267 [ 14,17 ] .",
    "then the formula is similar to that usually used in the framework of the single - particle potential approaches with using occupation numbers assumed in the shell model [ 23 ] in calculations of root mean square radii .",
    "it was also shown [ 17 ] that the number of the peripheral clusters can be fixed at 4 for the nuclei with @xmath265 , then the root mean square radius @xmath268 where @xmath269 is calculated as follows    @xmath270    for odd @xmath4 the charge radius @xmath271 is calculated by the equation    @xmath272    where the radius of the position of the single @xmath17-pair @xmath163 ( 21 ) is weighted by factor 0.5 .",
    "for the nuclei with @xmath273 @xmath269 is calculated as @xmath267 , see ( 15 ) in [ 17 ] .",
    "the radii calculated in the representation of the alpha - cluster shell model @xmath267 have deviation @xmath274 fm with ( 24 ) ( for odd @xmath4 ( 25 ) ) for the nuclei with @xmath60 [ 17 ] .    a good agreement between the values of r ( 23 ) and @xmath269 ( 24 ) ( for odd @xmath4 ( 25 ) ) and the experimental radii of the most abundant isotopes @xmath10 [ 9,22,24 ] is shown in fig .",
    "4 . from the figure one can see that for all nuclei with @xmath5 , @xmath55 , the eqs .",
    "( 23 ) and ( 24 ) give close to the experimental data values .",
    "the values as well as the calculated radii of the @xmath0-decay nuclei stable to @xmath6-decay [ 21 ] with @xmath275 are presented in the tables in [ 10 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath269 calculated for two nuclei @xmath111 , @xmath276 are not in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "these nuclei do not have enough number of bonds between the clusters and the single @xmath17-pair to provide a sufficient nuclear density .",
    "for the nuclei with @xmath277 the deviation of @xmath269 ( 23 ) and ( 24)/(25 ) from the experimental values @xmath278 is @xmath279 fm .",
    "the deviation between the two lines in fig .",
    "4 for the nuclei with @xmath280 is @xmath281 fm .",
    "the values of experimental radii of 125 stable isotopes @xmath278 [ 9,22,24,25,26 ] are also given in dependence of @xmath74 and @xmath4 .",
    "the radii @xmath278 are given without indication of their errors , which in most of the cases are within @xmath282 fm .",
    "it visually approves that fact [ 10 ] that both distributions of radii on @xmath74 and @xmath4 are well described by the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the approach based on the @xmath0-cluster model proposes some formulas to calculate the binding energies and the charge radii of the nuclei of the @xmath6-stability path and around it .",
    "the formulas have been derived on the basis of the idea of isospin independence of inter - nucleon interactions in the @xmath0-cluster structure .",
    "the approach implies that the nucleus is a dense package of alpha - clusters .",
    "the inter - cluster distances are determined by the charge radii of the clusters .",
    "some amount of excess neutrons fill in the gap between the matter bodies of the @xmath0-clusters of the core [ 10 ] .",
    "the energy of these excess neutrons is described by a smooth function on the number of the @xmath9-pairs ( 13 ) .",
    "the formula to calculate the binding energy proper for the nucleus with five @xmath0-clusters ( 7 ) turned out to be good for the other nuclei up to the most heavy ones .",
    "the same thing one can say about the formula to calculate the charge radii @xmath283 with the average charge radius of one nucleon of the @xmath0-cluster structure @xmath284 fm for the all nuclei with @xmath55 , see fig 4 .    the formula to calculate the nuclear binding energy is evidently different from the well known weizscker formula .",
    "these two approaches give different estimations of the total coulomb energy and the energy due to all inter - nucleon interactions , but the values of the total binding energies of these approaches are close . to calculate the charge radii both the approaches propose successful but different formulas , one is @xmath11 and the other @xmath12 .",
    "a few useful phenomenological formulas have been found in the approach .",
    "these are the formulas to calculate the root mean square charge radius , the coulomb radius and the radius of the last proton s position in dependence on the number of @xmath0-clusters .",
    "besides , the empirical values of the coulomb energy and the surface tension energy with a good accuracy have been obtained for the nuclei with @xmath80 .    the values of the coulomb repulsion energy and the nuclear force energy of the inter - cluster interaction , which are 1.925 mev and 4.350 mev , correspondingly , could be a good test in a microscopic description of the light nuclei @xmath2 and @xmath33 in the framework of the few - body approach .",
