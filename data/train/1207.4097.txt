    "a large effort in condensed - matter physics is dedicated to the classification of distinct phases of matter , exploring their properties , and establishing their robustness .",
    "many phases of matter can be classified by the pattern in which a ground - state manifold breaks spontaneously _ and _ locally a symmetry of the underlying many - body hamiltonian .",
    "the experimental discovery in ref .   of the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in high - quality gaas - al@xmath3ga@xmath4as heterostructures subjected to very large magnetic field in 1982 was revolutionary in that the fqhe is associated to a family of phases of matter that are not characterized by some pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking with a local order parameter , but instead by the notion of topological order .",
    "@xcite by analogy with spontaneous symmetry breaking and its connection to ( lie ) group theory , a classification of topological order for many - body hamiltonians has been undertaken .",
    "@xcite    the study of all possible patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking or topological order , although immensely useful , fails to address a very important question .",
    "what is the mechanism by which a given pattern associated to a phase is established ? this is a quantitative question that requires deciding in the simplest case of two competing terms in a many - body hamiltonian ( free energy ) which one is the dominant one . answering this question ,",
    "although essential from a practical point of view , can be very difficult .",
    "detailed prescriptions of the hamiltonian matter so that nonuniversality rules when calculating the location in the phase diagram of the boundaries separating phases of matter . in practice",
    ", a realistic answer to this question requires modern computing power if at all possible .",
    "a problem related to the stability of phases is as follows .",
    "suppose that we are given two physically different realizations of the same universal phase : are the most favorable conditions for realizing the phase in one physical setting the same as in the other ?",
    "more specifically , this paper analyzes the optimal situation for stabilizing a fractional chern insulator ( fci ) .",
    "it also compares and contrasts it to the optimal situation for stabilizing a fqhe in a landau level .",
    "fractional chern insulators are strongly correlated phases of matter for interacting fermions and bosons that have been found in bloch bands with vanishing or small bandwidth and nonvanishing chern number .",
    "@xcite fermionic fcis share the universal properties of the fqhe that occurs upon partial filling of landau levels .",
    "it was thus not surprising that the efforts to establish that fcis can be realized in model hamiltonians began by mimicking as closely as possible the conditions for obtaining the fqhe in landau levels .",
    "bloch bands were chosen so as to try to mirror the properties of the landau levels , which are special because ( i ) they support a topological attribute called a chern number that equals 1 , and ( ii ) they are independent of their momentum quantum number , i.e. , they can be thought of as flat bands .",
    "bloch bands can be made to satisfy properties ( i ) and ( ii).@xcite however , even if the bloch bands are made to satisfy conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) , it is not _ a priori _ obvious that energetics allow the formation of a fractional quantum hall ground state .",
    "@xcite for example , the filling fraction 1/3 is commensurate to the lattice ; hence , one might expect that , instead of a fractional chern state , interactions select a charge density wave as the ground state .",
    "nevertheless , it has become apparent from exact diagonalization studies of fcis that the universal properties of the fqhe can be stabilized by starting from filling partially a ( sufficiently ) flat band of a chern band insulator for some short - range interaction .",
    "that one can deviate slightly from condition ( ii ) without destroying the fci phase is expected , for the topological phase is gapped and therefore stable to small perturbations . in contrast , one can not deviate continuously from condition ( i ) , for the chern number is an integer .",
    "the work presented below aims to analyze cases when departing from the conditions ( i ) and ( ii ) , associated to the fqhe in landau bands , can lead to enhanced stability of the fcis .",
    "we present a lattice model for which the chern number can take values @xmath5 .",
    "we how that it is more difficult to stabilize a fci with @xmath2 than a fci with @xmath1 due to energetics for this model .",
    "we find that the gaps for a fci at the filling fraction @xmath6 when @xmath1 are almost two orders of magnitude larger than those for the most stable fractional chern state that we found for the filling fraction @xmath7 when @xmath2 .    to establish that the state at @xmath6 is a fci and not some competing state that breaks spontaneously and locally some space - group symmetry of the lattice , we present in this paper a useful tool to distinguish fractional chern states from charge density wave ( cdw ) states even when the lattices studied are rather small .",
    "we employ this diagnostic to map out the phase diagram that should emerge in the thermodynamic limit as a function of the strength of interactions , and to identify the nature of the phases that compete with the @xmath6 fci at @xmath1 . in doing so , we substantiate our claim that a fci can be stabilized by moving away from property ( i ) obeyed by the landau levels",
    ".    we then proceed to study the effects of relaxing the flatness condition ( ii ) .",
    "we argue that relaxing condition ( ii ) can help stabilize a fci .",
    "we do this in two ways .",
    "first , we appeal to a general argument that relies on a particle - hole transformation of any hamiltonian @xmath8 for itinerant and interacting electrons with a topological flat band . by construction , if @xmath8 supports as a ground state a fci at the filling fraction @xmath9 , then the particle - hole transformed hamiltonian @xmath10 supports a fci at the filling fraction @xmath11 .",
    "we show that if the interaction is a two - body one with translational symmetry , then @xmath10 acquires a one - body contribution through normal ordering .",
    "this simple observation has the following remarkable consequence .",
    "a fci at the filling fraction @xmath12 might exist even though @xmath10 can be decomposed into a one - body term that generates a band - width of the same order as the normal - ordered two - body interaction .",
    "conversely , if this one - body term is switched off adiabatically , the ground state at the filling fraction @xmath12 might undergo a phase transition to a phase that does not support a topological order . in fact , this is the explanation for the numerical observation that distinct @xmath8 at the filling fractions @xmath7 or @xmath6 support fcis as the ground states , while the very same @xmath8 at the filling fractions @xmath13 or @xmath14 are not topologically ordered .",
    "@xcite    second , in order to probe the phase diagram of the system as a function of two parameters , one of which controls the size of the bandwidth , we use another numerical tool to help trace out the phase boundaries of topological states using exact diagonalization studies of small lattices .",
    "we look at the ratio between the observed gap @xmath15 and the spread in energy @xmath16 of those states that belong to the manifold of states that are to become degenerate in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "if @xmath17 is the characteristic linear size of the lattice , this ratio @xmath18 entails information on the correlation length @xmath19 of the system .",
    "the correlation length @xmath19 is a useful mean to measure the distance to the phase boundary . by combining the parametric dependence of @xmath15 along contours at constant @xmath20",
    ", we can estimate the region of stability of the fci at @xmath6 and @xmath1 from exact diagonalization .",
    "we find that moving away from condition ( ii ) that is obeyed by landau levels , i.e. , including a non - zero bandwidth , can ( up to a limit ) help increase ( and not decrease ) the range of phase stability .",

    "increasing the bandwidth of the noninteracting bloch bands to some critical value must result in a phase transition to a new correlated ground state , say a state that supports long - range order or a gapless featureless ground state such as a fermi liquid . for a laughlin state at filling @xmath9 , lifting",

    "second , we give supporting numerical evidences for a scenario by which switching on a finite bandwidth according to eq .",

    "for the analytical argument , consider an interacting hamiltonian of the form    @xmath217    that operates exclusively on the fock space built out of the fermion creation operators @xmath218 , of an isolated flat band .",
    "this model is generic for translational invariant density - density interactions which have matrix elements of the form @xmath219    in the projected ( flat ) band , where @xmath220 denotes the overlap between a pair of normalized single - particle bloch states at @xmath221 and @xmath222 is the fourier component in the bz of the unprojected and translational invariant two - body interaction .",
    "suppose that the ground state of @xmath8 at filling @xmath9 is a fractional chern state [ for instance , this is the case for the hamiltonian   with @xmath6 ] .",
    "we apply a particle - hole transformation in this isolated band .",
    "this amounts to the transformation @xmath224 , @xmath225 .",
    "we obtain the transformed hamiltonian    @xmath226    in a normal - ordered form , where @xmath227    we then conclude that , by construction , @xmath10 supports a fractional chern state ( of holes ) as its ground state at filling @xmath11 [ for instance , @xmath10 when derived from hamiltonian   at @xmath6 supports a fractional chern state ( of holes ) as its ground state at the filling @xmath14 ] .",
    "this fractional chern state of holes at the filling fraction @xmath11 is stabilized in the presence of a one - body dispersion that is of the same order as the interaction itself and given by @xmath229 .",
    "this one - body term can be interpreted as an optimal choice of the band dispersion that delivers as the ground state the fractional chern state at the filling fraction @xmath11 .",
    "this one - body term is a trivial constant if and only if all overlaps between normalized bloch states are functions of @xmath230 only .",
    "conversely , if overlaps between normalized bloch states also vary as a function of @xmath231 , then the particle - hole transformed hamiltonian @xmath10 acquires a genuine one - body dispersion .",
    "turning off adiabatically this genuine dispersion can induce a phase transition to a ground state that does not display a fractional ( hole ) state at the filling fraction @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , at the filling fraction @xmath14 , the hamiltonians studied numerically in refs .   and",
    "can be interpreted as the hamiltonian obtained from @xmath10 upon subtracting the one - body term @xmath229 .",
    "these hamiltonians at this filling fraction do not support a fractional chern ground state , although @xmath10 does .",
    "we close this discussion by observing that the one - body dispersion  ( [ eq : def geometric one - body term induced by ph trsf ] ) induced by a particle - hole transformation has an elegant geometric interpretation that makes it possible to characterize fcis though a local quantum metric tensor .",
    "the qualifier quantum originates from the fact that this local metric tensor is related to the overlaps of normalized bloch states . from this geometrical point of view",
    ", we are going to show that the fqhe can be thought of as a fci with a locally flat quantum metric tensor . to carry out this program , we observe that the one - body dispersion  ( [ eq : def geometric one - body term induced by ph trsf ] ) depends functionally on any one of the quantum distances ( metrics )    @xmath232    labeled by the real - valued parameter @xmath233 between the normalized single - particle bloch states at @xmath221 . with this definition",
    ", @xmath234 does indeed satisfy @xmath235 if and only if @xmath236 , @xmath237 , and the triangle inequality @xmath238 for any triplet of momenta from the bz .",
    "now the overlap between any pair of normalized bloch state can be expressed in terms of any one of these metrics , @xmath239^{2/\\kappa}. \\label{eq : one body term and metric}\\ ] ]    the so - called fubini - study metric ,  @xcite defined by selecting @xmath240 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : def metrics labeled by kappa ] ) and ( [ eq : one body term and metric ] ) , plays a special role , for it also enters in the algebra of projected density operators as shown by roy in ref .  .",
    "for this reason , we select the fubini - study metric and drop the reference to @xmath240 from now on . the usefulness of eq .",
    "( [ eq : one body term and metric ] ) is rooted in the observation that , in the thermodynamic limit , if we introduce the local ( fubini - study ) metric tensor @xmath241 through the line integral along the paths @xmath242 connecting the pair @xmath243 and @xmath244 @xmath245 then the local flatness condition @xmath246 implies that @xmath247 is a function of @xmath248 only .",
    "the condition of local flatness on the fubini - study metric tensor has two important consequences .",
    "first , the one - body dispersion generated by the particle - hole transformation on the translational invariant two - body interaction is a constant according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : one body term and metric ] ) , as is the case for the landau levels in the fqhe .",
    "second , as shown by roy in ref .",
    ", the algebra of projected density operators closes , as is the case for the landau levels in the fqhe .",
    "thus , it is the departure from a flat ( fubini - study ) metric tensor that can endow the stability of a fci with a subtle dependence on a nonvanishing band - width , as we exemplify next .",
    "we now return to the numerical study of the model defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def h0 lambda ] ) , in order to explore the effect of a band dispersion quantitatively . to do so , we need a measure for the stability of a phase that we identify by a set of quasidegenerate ground states of small lattices .    one measure for the stability of the phase is simply the size of the gap @xmath15 above the ground - state manifold , i.e. , the difference in energy between the highest of a tuple of quasidegenerate ground - state energies and the lowest - energy eigenvalue above it .",
    "a second measure for the stability of the phase is the correlation length @xmath19 characterizing the exponential decay of the ground - state expectation values of products of a pair of local operators separated by the distance @xmath157 .",
    "the shorter @xmath19 is , the farther is a ground state from a quantum phase transition .",
    "if a manifold of ground states consists of topologically degenerate states as is the case for the fci , they become exactly degenerate in the thermodynamic limit with the property that no local operator can transform one of the ground states into another . for a finite system , in contrast ,",
    "a splitting @xmath16 in energy between the highest and the lowest of the quasidegenerate ground states is to be generically expected .",
    "this splitting can be used as a measure of @xmath19 through the ansatz @xmath249 where @xmath17 is the characteristic linear size of the system .    for concreteness , we focus on the fci at @xmath6 with a fivefold quasidegenerate ground state .",
    "we interpolate between the flat band and the original noninteracting hamiltonian with the help of the family of noninteracting hamiltonians  ( [ eq : def h0 lambda ] ) parametrized by @xmath250 $ ] and calculate how the stability of the candidate fci phase changes , as measured by @xmath15 and @xmath20 . varying @xmath75 from 0 to 1 makes it possible to change the bandwidth @xmath57 of the lower band relative to the energy scale of the interaction .",
    "the bandwidth of the bloch band is thus given by @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the bandwidth of the noninteracting band , that depends on the parameters of the model , @xmath253 in our case .",
    "we do , however , project the hilbert space to the one spanned by the single - particle states of the lower band for all values of @xmath75 .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : finitedisp ] both @xmath15 and @xmath20 as a function of the bandwidth - parameter @xmath75 and the parameter @xmath254 of the noninteracting hamiltonian  , where the bandwidth is @xmath255 .",
    "while the largest absolute gap @xmath15 is indeed obtained for the limit of flat bands @xmath73 in this parameter space , we observe that for a large range of values of @xmath254 both the gap @xmath15 as well as the quotient @xmath20 can be substantially increased as @xmath75 becomes larger .",
    "we interpret this as an increase in the stability of the fci phase with increasing bandwidth of the noninteracting band and exemplify this scenario for @xmath256 in fig .",
    "[ fig : finitedisp](c ) .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the fci is stable against a substantial bandwidth of the order of the interaction energy scale for @xmath257 .",
    "the search of materials that realize fcis requires the hierarchy of energy scales @xmath258 with the largest and smallest energy scale the band gap @xmath58 and the bandwidth @xmath57 of the noninteracting band structure , respectively , while the intermediary energy scale @xmath51 is the characteristic interaction energy .",
    "this work assumes the limit @xmath259 and deals with the energetic question of what is the optimum ratio of @xmath260 needed to stabilize fcis .    in this work",
    "we have established that fractional chern insulator phases can be stabilized in situations that differ considerably from the ordinary landau level paradigm , namely a flat band - with chern number 1 .",
    "we have characterized the phase diagram of a model that hosts bloch bands with chern number either one or two by means of exact diagonalization . together with the usual characterizations via flux insertion and the counting of degenerate ground states ,",
    "we have mapped out the real space density profile of several phases that appear in this model at filling @xmath6 for @xmath1 : cdw , phase separation , and fractional chern insulator .",
    "we showed that the gaps for the @xmath6 fractional chern insulating state with @xmath1 are more than one order of magnitude larger than those for the most stable state that we found in the model for @xmath2 , at @xmath7 . from these studies",
    "we conclude that the most favorable conditions to stabilize a fci need not be those with @xmath2 .    by analyzing the phase boundaries of the @xmath6 fractional chern insulating state for @xmath1",
    ", we have found instances for which the flat band condition is not optimal .",
    "instead a nonvanishing bandwidth is . in these examples ,",
    "the stability of the fci first increases with bandwidth , reaches a maximum , and then decreases again as too large a bandwidth compared to the interaction energy scale disfavors the topological state .",
    "we have thus shown that it is possible to enhance the stability of a fractional chern insulator by moving away from the condition of flat bands .    the energetic question of when electron - electron interactions can select strongly correlated phases of matter supporting topological order is much more subtle when electrons populate the bloch levels of a chern band insulator instead of the lowest landau level .",
    "this difference manifests itself with the fact that the berry curvature is never constant throughout the bz in the former case , whereas it is perfectly flat for the lowest landau level in the latter case . in this sense ,",
    "the competition between the kinetic energy and the electron - electron interaction is much richer for fcis than it is for the fqhe from the lowest landau level .",
