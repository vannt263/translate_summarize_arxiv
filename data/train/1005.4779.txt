    "supersymmetry(susy ) has emerged as one of the leading candidates for unraveling the physics beyond the standard model(sm ) .",
    "the most challenging and longstanding questions in the context of supersymmetric theories are related to the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "the need for susy breaking originates from the fact that no superparticle has yet been observed in nature .",
    "the fine tuning / gauge hierarchy problem points towards the requirement of the susy breaking scale being close to tev so that the higgs mass does not receive radiative corrections beyond tev . as a result tev scale supersymmetric theories",
    "have drawn special attentions in view of the forthcoming results in the lhc . a possible origin of these symmetry breaking terms",
    "can be understood by embedding mssm in a supergravity theory ( sugra)@xcite .",
    "supergravity theories drew further attention when they were shown to emerge as low energy effective theories of underlying string theories which can take care of the renormalizability problems persistent in the supergravity models .    in a plethora of supergravity models supersymmetry",
    "is assumed to be spontaneously broken at a high energies ( @xmath6 ) via the vacuum expectation value(vev ) of the @xmath7 or @xmath8 terms @xcite .",
    "some realistic models of spontaneous susy breaking requires two different sets of superfields , one of which participate in standard model gauge interactions and the other consists of singlets under the sm gauge group .",
    "the singlet fields usually have very large vev and constitute the hidden sector of the theory .",
    "such a sector has it s natural origin in the framework of string theory . in a formalism",
    "where the matter fields of the mssm constituting the observable sector are assumed to couple with the hidden sector singlets via gravitational interactions , spontaneous susy breaking in the hidden sector results into generation of soft - susy breaking terms in the observable sector@xcite .",
    "if the local susy breaking is expected at a scale @xmath9 , the soft terms would have a scale of order @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the planck mass .",
    "considering @xmath12 , soft supersymmetry breaking terms @xmath13 tev can be produced at the observable sector .",
    "supergravity models however are often encountered with the existence of flat directions in the hidden sector .",
    "it is therefore necessary to lift the flat directions by appropriate mechanism .",
    "while normally susy breaking leads to appearance of non - vanishing vacuum energy , some of the of the sugra models may have broken susy with vanishing vacuum energy .",
    "the experimental data indeed indicates a near - flatness of the present universe @xcite with a vanishingly small vacuum energy . simple model like no - scale supergravity scenario can give plausible explanation for nearly vanishing vacuum energy .",
    "however these models have limitations to produce viable susy phenomenology at low energies(@xmath13tev ) @xcite .",
    "therefore the search for a near - minkowski / de - sitter vacua has attracted considerable interest in recent years . in this regard various supergravity and string motivated models generating de - sitter vacua at the tev scale have been proposed @xcite .",
    "substantial progress have been made in this direction by a model developed in 2003@xcite in the context of string theory known as the kklt model .",
    "this was followed by a plethora of propositions @xcitewhich revolve around building an effective description of low energy physics through a superpotential generated by background fluxes and a convenient choice of khler potential motivated by a suitable compactification scheme arising in string / m - theory .",
    "+ in this backdrop we address the following question in the present article :    * what are the general set of criteria that the kahler and superpotential of a supergravity model have to satisfy to produce a viable phenomenology at the tev scale so that there is no flat direction in the model and the effective vacuum energy at the low energy is tiny and positive which is compatible to the present day observation ?    adapting the technique proposed in @xcite an additional moduli field is incorporated in both the superpotential and the khler potential . as can be seen latter ,",
    "this extra moduli field is crucial in producing small vacuum energy , once susy is broken at the hidden sector . a small vacuum energy at the minimum and viable susy breaking terms at the observable sector",
    "restrict the choice of the khler and the superpotential .",
    "the order of magnitude of the gravitino mass and the soft susy breaking parameters namely the soft scalar mass , and the coefficient of the trilinear and the bilinear terms are estimated .",
    "this set - up is later illustrated with a toy model .    in section ( 1.1 ) of this article a brief review of @xcite is presented . in section",
    "( 2 ) an extension of the same has been suggested .",
    "section ( 3 ) provides the extremization condition for the scalar potential .",
    "section ( 4 ) deals with the estimation of soft susy breaking parameters .",
    "in section ( 5 ) a possible model is proposed in support of our analysis .",
    "section ( 6 ) is devoted to summarizing the work .      in this section a brief review of some parts of the kklt proposal relevant to the present work is presented .",
    "we begin with a quick revisit to the basic frame work of @xmath14 supergravity .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the complete lagrangian ( up to two derivatives ) in @xmath0 supergravity is specified by chiral superfields @xmath15 of the theory where the index @xmath16 runs over the entire set of chiral superfields , the analytic gauge - kinetic function @xmath17 , and the real gauge - invariant khler function @xmath18 .",
    "the dimensionless function @xmath19 is defined in terms of khler potential @xmath20 and superpotential @xmath21 as ,    @xmath22    where @xmath23 denotes the planck scale .",
    "the tree level(f - part ) supergravity scalar potential in the einstein frame is given by    @xmath24    here @xmath25 is the khler covariant derivative of the superpotential and @xmath26 is the khler metric .",
    "now , using @xmath27 the scalar potential can be recast as    @xmath28    in type - iib string theory de - sitter solutions are forbidden in the leading order of @xmath29 ( the string tension ) and @xmath30 ( the string coupling ) by a no - go theorem @xcite .",
    "so a natural way of finding a de - sitter solution in string theory is to include corrections from higher order in @xmath31 and @xmath30 to the no - scale structure . in @xcite",
    "this objective is achieved in a two fold way :    1 .   in the presence of a non - zero flux",
    "the calabi - yau moduli combines suitably to form a superpotential of the form + @xmath32 + where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the ns - ns and r - r three - form fluxes and @xmath35 is the axion - dilaton of type - iib string theory .",
    "the khler structure of the internal manifold ( calabi - yau four - fold ) is encoded in a khler potential whose tree - level form is + @xmath36 - ln[- i   ( \\tau - \\overline{\\tau } ) ] - ln [ \\int_m \\omega \\wedge \\overline{\\omega}]),\\ ] ] + where @xmath37 is the single volume modulus .",
    "+ this structure however does not admit any de - sitter solution and therefore calls for inclusion of corrections to the leading order .",
    "the relevant correction terms can be attributed to two different sources .",
    "one of these , being instanton correction which at large volume of the internal four - fold yields an additional term to the superpotential + @xmath38 + while @xmath39 is the holomorphic one - loop determinant , the leading order in the exponential originates from the action of euclidean @xmath40-branes wrapping on a four - cycle . with all other moduli fixed , they can be integrated out to produce an effective superpotential for @xmath37 alone .",
    "+ the origin of the other correction is described as follows . in type",
    "ii - b string theory compactified on a calabi - yau fourfold a stack of @xmath41 number of d7 branes wrapping on 4-cycles in the compact manifold gives rise to non - abelian gauge groups .",
    "the effective low - energy @xmath0 supersymmetric theory undergoes gluino condensation resulting into a superpotential , + @xmath42 + here @xmath43 is the dynamical scale of gauge theory .",
    "the coefficient @xmath44 can be determined by the energy scale below which supersymmetric qcd is valid . plugging @xmath45 in the superpotential along with a logarithmic @xmath46 dependence in the khler potential we arrive at , @xmath47 + where @xmath48 .",
    "+ in a supersymmetric vacuum @xmath49 .",
    "the axion field in @xmath37 is set to zero for the sake of simplification .",
    "@xmath50 is taken to be real and @xmath51 to be negative .",
    "the condition for susy preserving vacua corresponds to the minimum of the scalar potential determined by the vev of @xmath46 .",
    "+ @xmath52 + here @xmath53 denotes the vev of @xmath54 .",
    "this makes the scalar potential ( [ pot1 ] ) negative at the minimum and can be given by , + @xmath55 + thus a supersymmetry preserving ads minimum has been generated . fixing the values of @xmath56 , one can estimate the vev of the moduli @xmath46 via ( [ condition ] ) which in turn determines the @xmath57 through ( [ adspot ] ) .",
    "2 .   the next important step is to add a de - sitter lifting term to the scalar potential .",
    "the principal issue is to allow for generation of some extra energy from the flux background which shows up in the scalar potential as an extra term namely @xmath58 .",
    "this is achieved by incorporating anti @xmath40-branes ( @xmath59-branes ) in the picture .",
    "the coefficient d depends on the number of @xmath59-branes introduced .",
    "the introduction of @xmath59-brane breaks supersymmetry and the results in a positive definite vacuum energy by compensating the ads value of the scalar potential at the minimum .",
    "moreover , by fine - tuning @xmath8 , one can have a ds minimum close to zero .",
    "we now employ the basic philosophy employed in kklt model to the @xmath60 , @xmath14 supergravity to investigate the issue of small and positive cosmological constant with the generation of soft susy breaking terms at the tev scale . in the present context , we restrict ourselves to the tree level contribution of the cosmological constant , while it is possible to limit the effect of radiative corrections in this computation@xcite .",
    "we will show how the khler correction may lead to the ads / ds nature of the scalar potential .",
    "in this section a scenario in the context of @xmath60 , @xmath14 supergravity is constructed with an ads minimum where supersymmetry is broken at an intermediate energy scale ( lower than the planck scale and higher than the tev scale ) . in this construction @xmath61 is assumed to run over the superfields in the hidden sector as well as in the observable sector .",
    "the superpotential and khler potential which represent the hidden sector contributions are denoted by @xmath62 and @xmath63 .    while generating the small ads minimum at the hidden sector , we will now try to address the following question in context of the present scenario vis - a - vis the kklt model on a very general ground .",
    "* does the inclusion of the extra modulus in the set - up improves our understanding of the intermediate local supersymmetry breaking and helps to generate a vanishingly small positive cosmological constant as well as viable susy breaking terms at the observable sector ?    in seeking a probable answer to this question",
    "an additional hidden sector moduli @xmath64 is inserted in the superpotential and khler potential ( [ superpot4 ] ) . in particular , the additional term in the superpotential is intended for providing an mechanism for susy breaking at the intermediate scale .",
    "the modified superpotential assumes the form ,    @xmath65    in the present set - up the tree level khler potential may receive corrections from various sources , e.g string loop correction ( higher order in @xmath31 and @xmath30 ) . with this possibility in mind a correction term @xmath66 is appended to the tree level khler potential .",

    "this work is an attempt to establish the required constraints on the structures of these models in order to get the desired features . in this work",
    "we have considered a general supergravity scenario which simultaneously may address the issues of early inflationary phase of the universe , smallness of the observed cosmological constant in the present epoch as well as the tev scale supersymmetry breaking which are known to be deeply connected to each other . in our analysis",
    "we assume the existence of a hidden sector with appropriate vev of the moduli fields which couples gravitationally with the observable sector.considering a dual scenario namely flux compactification and gaugino condensation at two different scales , we achieve to bring out the necessary constraints on the kahler potential and superpotential so that the desired phenomenological values of the observable sector parameters can be obtained with no flat direction in the resulting scalar sector.we have shown that at least two hidden sector fields are necessary to achieve this .",
    "we conclude by presenting a simple model in support of the analysis carried out in this work to illustrate that all the generic constraints on the khler and superpotential may be mutually compatible .",
    "various parameters of the observable sector are estimated for this model .",
    "our constraints thus put a set of restrictions on the class of supergravity models which they have to satisfy to yield phenomenologically viable results so that the following features can be achieved concomitantly :    * soft supersymmetry breaking parameters are generated in the observable sector at the tev scale . * all the flat directions in the hidden sector are removed to have well - defined estimates of the soft breaking parameters . *",
    "the resulting vacuum energy appearing from various mechanisms add up to a tiny positive value consistent with the presently observed de - sitter character of the universe .",
