    "in recent years there has been a great deal of interest in the interplay of nonlinearity and applied forcing ( deterministic and/or stochastic ) in the stationary and transport properties of discrete spatially extended systems @xcite .",
    "the ability of discrete anharmonic arrays to localize and propagate energy in a persistent fashion , and the fact that noise may act ( sometimes against one s intuition ) to enhance these properties , has led to particularly intense activity @xcite .",
    "interesting noise - induced phenomena include stochastic resonance @xcite , noise - induced phase transitions @xcite , noise - induced front propagation @xcite , and array - enhanced stochastic resonance @xcite .",
    "our interests in this area have been motivated by the relative dearth of information concerning the effects of a thermal environment on the sometimes exquisite balances that are required to achieve these interesting resonances and persistences @xcite . at the same time , we have also noted that most of the literature has concentrated on overdamped arrays ( often motivated by mathematical or computational constraints rather than physical considerations ) , a restriction that leaves out important inertial effects and that is easily overcome .",
    "perhaps the simplest generic discrete arrays in which to analyze these issues are systems of oscillators consisting of masses that may be subject to local monostable potentials ( harmonic or anharmonic ) and nearest neighbor monostable interactions ( harmonic or anharmonic ) ( other generic arrays of current interest are bistable units linearly or nonlinearly connected to one another ) .",
    "these are the systems of choice in our work , and we have separated our inquiries into three distinct groups of questions : 1 ) the study of such arrays in thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "the questions here concern the spatial and temporal  energy landscape \" that determines the degree of spontaneous energy localization due to thermal fluctuations and the temporal persistence of high or low energy regions ; 2 ) the study of the propagation of a persistent signal applied at one end of the array @xcite .",
    "the questions here concern the signal - to - noise ratio and distance of signal propagation ; 3 ) the study of the propagation of an initial @xmath0-function energy pulse ( this work ) .",
    "the questions here concern the velocity of propagation and the dispersion of such a pulse .",
    "it is useful and relevant to provide a very brief summary of our conclusions on the first two sets of questions .",
    "our work on equilibrium energy landscapes @xcite was based on chains of harmonically coupled oscillators subject to a local potential that may be anharmonic .",
    "each oscillator is connected to a heat bath at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "we analyzed the thermal fluctuations and their persistence as influenced by the local potential ( we compared hard , harmonic , and soft potentials ) , the strength of the harmonic coupling between the oscillators , the strength of the dissipative force connecting each mass to the heat bath , and the temperature . among our conclusions",
    "are the following : 1 ) an increase in temperature in weakly coupled soft chains leads not only to greater energy fluctuations but also to a slower decay of these fluctuations ; 2 ) an increase in temperature in weakly dissipative hard chains leads not only to greater energy fluctuations but also to a slower decay of these fluctuations ; 3 ) high - energy - fluctuation mobility in harmonically coupled nonlinear chains in thermal equilibrium does _ not _ occur beyond that which is observed in a completely harmonic chain .    however , we noted earlier that interest in energy localization in perfect arrays , as contrasted with localization induced by disorder , arises in part because localized energy in these systems may be _",
    "mobile_. dispersionless or very slowly dispersive mobility would make it possible for localized energy to reach a predetermined location where it can participate in a physical or chemical event .",
    "our results raised the possibility of observing such localized mobility if the anharmonicity lies in the interoscillator interactions rather than ( or in addition to ) the local potentials .",
    "we ascertained that a persistent sinusoidal force applied to one site of a chain of masses connected by anharmonic springs may indeed propagate along the chain @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrated a set of resonance phenomena that we have called _ thermal resonances _ because they involve optimization via _ temperature _ control . in particular , these results establish the existence of optimal finite temperatures for the enhancement of the signal - to - noise ratio at any site along the chain , and of an optimal temperature for maximal distance of propagation along the chain .",
    "these resonances differ from the usual noise - enhanced propagation where the noise is external and/or the system is overdamped .",
    "this work addresses the third set of questions posed above concerning the way in which a nonequilibrium initial condition in the form of an energy pulse propagates as the system relaxes toward equilibrium .",
    "more specifically , we investigate the motion and dispersion of such an energy pulse and the effects of finite temperatures on pulse propagation . in view of our earlier results on thermal resonances ,",
    "perhaps the most interesting question to be asked at this point is this : is it possible to enhance pulse propagation via temperature control ?    in order to monitor the evolution of the nonequilibrium initial condition it is useful to partition the hamiltonian as @xmath2 where @xmath3 contains the kinetic energy of site @xmath4 and an appropriate portion of the potential energy of interaction with its nearest neighbors ( 1/2 in one dimension , 1/4 in two dimensions ) . in one dimension",

    "the hard oscillator frequency curve starts below the other two if a harmonic portion is not included .",
    "these frequency  energy trends are generalized to oscillator chains in appendix  [ a ] .",
    "the frequency vs energy behavior will figure prominently in our subsequent interpretations .",
    "in particular , the following broad view seems to be overarchingly supported : the speed and dispersion of pulse propagation in discrete arrays of oscillators are principally dependent on the mean frequency associated with the energy in the pulse .",
    "higher frequencies lead to faster propagation and slower dispersion .",
    "we consider one - dimensional arrays of @xmath30 sites numbered from @xmath31 to @xmath32 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we distinguish isolated chains ( that is , ones not connected to a heat bath ) , chains connected to a heat bath at zero temperature , and finite temperature chains .",

    "the chain is first allowed to equilibrate and then this impulse is imparted in addition to the thermal motions already present .",

    "the numerical integration of the equations of motion is performed using the second order heun s method ( which is equivalent to a second order runge kutta integration ) @xcite with a time step @xmath38 .",

    "the pulse velocity in the soft chain _ decreases _ with increasing initial amplitude .",
    "this is because the mean frequency for the soft chains decreases with increasing energy .",
    "we note that with our choice of potentials the velocity in the hard chain for very weak initial amplitudes may actually lie below that of the harmonic chain or even the soft chain because we have omitted a harmonic contribution to the hard potential , but the hard chain velocity necessarily increases and surpasses that of the other chains with increasing initial pulse amplitude .    not only is the pulse transmitted more rapidly in the hard isolated chains than in the others , but the pulse retains its integrity over longer distances in the hard chain .",

    "the dependence of the pulse width on friction ( not shown explicitly ) follows trends that are consistent with our other results .",

    "the local energy around this site then reaches a maximum , and the pulse moves on , leaving behind a series of later energy oscillations at ever decreasing amplitudes that eventually settle down to the appropriate thermal levels .",
    "the after - oscillations are derived analytically in appendix  [ b ] for the harmonic case .",
    "the discussion below concentrates exclusively on the first pulse , which we think of as characterizing the arrival of the disturbance at that site .",

    ".   the pulse velocity in the harmonic chain is _ independent _ of temperature .",
    "this is illustrated in the figure by the fact that the peak of the pulse reaches the particular site under observation at the same time for the two temperatures shown .",
    "the reason once again is that the characteristic frequencies of the chain are independent of energy and therefore the inclusion of thermal effects is immaterial to this measure . 2 .",
    "the pulse velocity in the hard chain _ increases _ with increasing temperature .",
    "this is illustrated by the ever earlier arrival of the pulse at the site under observation with increasing temperature .",
    "the reason is that the mean frequency of the chain increases with energy , so that the hard chain at higher temperatures is associated with a higher frequency than at lower temperatures and hence with a faster pulse .",
    "the pulse velocity in the soft chain _ decreases _ with increasing temperature .",
    "this is not explicitly illustrated in the figure , but is due to the decrease of the mean frequency with increasing temperature .",
    "thus the soft chain at higher temperatures is associated with a lower frequency and hence a slower pulse .",
    "the hard chain not only transmits pulses more rapidly than the other chains , increasingly so with increasing temperature , but it also transmits the most compact and persistent pulses at any temperature .",
    "this is seen not only by the obviously smaller width of the pulses in the hard chain , but by the fact that the energy trace  left behind \" as the first pulse passes through is lower in the hard chain than in the other cases .",
    "the pulses in all cases become more dispersive with increasing temperature .",
    "this behavior is clearly evident in fig .",
    "[ figsifsit ] for the hard and harmonic chains , as is the fact that the temperature dependence of the pulse width is weakest for the hard chain ( and strongest for the soft chain ) .",
    "these dependences complement those described earlier for the pulse width as a function of friction : increasing friction in all cases narrows the pulse ( subject to our caveat concerning the hard chain mentioned earlier ) while increasing the temperature broadens it , both of these dependences being weakest for the hard chain .",
    "we showed in sec .  [ isolated ] that a pulse travels more rapidly and less dispersively in an isolated hard chain than in a harmonic or soft chain . in higher dimensions these two tendencies , that of moving faster and that of maintaining the energy localized , leads to some interesting geometric effects and to very different pulse propagation properties depending on the spatial configuration of the initial condition .",
    "in one dimension one could visualize the displacements and momenta @xmath53 as describing motion along the chain or perpendicular to the chain . in two dimensions",
    "these are distinct cases : a generalization of the first requires introduction of two - dimensional coordinates @xmath54 and momenta @xmath55 .",

    "in this paper we have considered pulse propagation in discrete arrays of masses connected by harmonic or anharmonic springs .",
    "we have focused on the pulse velocity and width , and have found a pattern of behavior that can be strongly correlated with the energy dependence of the mean array frequency .",
    "first we investigated the propagation of pulses in isolated ( microcanonical ) arrays .",
    "we found that in a hard array an amplitude increase causes a pulse to travel more rapidly and less dispersively . in a harmonic array the pulse speed and width are independent of pulse amplitude , while in a soft array a more intense pulse travels more slowly and spreads out more rapidly .",
    "these trends are a result of the fact that in a hard array the mean frequency increases with energy , in a harmonic array it is independent of energy , and in a soft array the mean frequency decreases with increasing energy . in higher dimensions",
    "these trends lead to interesting initial condition dependences that in turn may lead to apparently  opposite \" behavior in different cases .",
    "thus , for example , a front in a two - dimensional isolated hard array propagates more rapidly and more sharply than in harmonic or soft arrays , and the effect is enhanced if the front is more intense . on the other hand ,",
    "a point pulse in a hard array spreads more slowly than in the others : it is not possible in this geometry to both propagate quickly and yet retain a strong localization of energy , and the latter tendency dominates the dynamics .",
    "we then investigated the effects on pulse propagation of connecting the nonlinear chains to a heat bath ( we did this only for the 1d arrays ) .",
    "we found that dissipative forces tend to slow down the pulse in the hard array , leave its speed unchanged in the harmonic chain , and actually speed it up in the soft array .",
    "this somewhat counterintuitive behavior is , however , fully consistent with the observation that dissipation causes a decrease in energy and hence a decrease in mean frequency in the hard case and an increase in mean frequency in the soft chain ( and no change in the mean frequency of the harmonic chain ) .",
    "dissipation in all cases causes a narrowing of the pulse , the effect being greatest in the soft array .",
    "an increase in temperature has the opposite ( and again at first sight perhaps somewhat counterintuitive ) effect : it speeds up the pulse in the hard array , leaves it unchanged in the harmonic array , and slows it down in the soft chain .",
    "again this behavior is consistent with the frequency vs energy trends and the fact that an increase in temperature is associated with an increase in the energy of the chain .",
    "a temperature increase in all cases causes a broadening of the pulse , the effect again being greatest in the soft array .",
