    "early radio continuum observations of bright galaxies established an approximately power - law relation between flux @xmath3 and frequency @xmath4 , typically parameterized by the spectral index @xmath0 , defined here as the positive power - law exponent : @xmath5 .",
    "the spectral index is an important observational quantity since it can be interpreted as a measure of a source s physical properties and processes .",
    "the spectra below @xmath6 ghz from star forming galaxies are typically modeled as the sum of synchrotron emission , with non - thermal spectral index @xmath7 -0.8 , and thermal bremsstrahlung , with thermal spectral index @xmath8 -0.1 ; an illustration of this model is provided in figure [ figtoon1 ] .",
    "prior surveys of spiral galaxies have reported narrow distributions of spectral indices : @xcite found @xmath0 = -0.85 between 1.4 and 5 ghz , found @xmath0 = -0.71 between 408 mhz and 10.7 ghz with a dispersion of 0.08 dex , and using a larger sample , found @xmath0 = -0.74 with a dispersion of 0.12 dex over the same frequency range .",
    "these sharply peaked empirical distributions of spectral indices are often interpreted as measures of the constancy of both the non - thermal spectral index and the thermal fraction among sampled galaxies .",
    "these studies typically find that the spectra are well described by power laws over observed frequency ranges spanning one or two orders of magnitude , a conclusion most evident from the `` average '' spectrum shown by .",
    "these results have led to the following common generalizations regarding the population of normal galaxies : ( 1 ) the total radio spectral index is @xmath9  -0.7 , ( 2 ) the synchrotron spectral index is @xmath9  -0.8 , and ( 3 ) synchrotron emission dominates over thermal emission at frequencies below 10 ghz , with the thermal fraction dropping to less than 10% at frequencies @xmath10 1 ghz .",
    "furthermore , these generalizations are often extrapolated to model the radio spectrum at frequencies lower and higher than the data upon which they are based .    in the simple model with power - law components , ,",
    "figure  [ figtoon1 ] , the total spectrum flattens with increasing frequency as the thermal component becomes the dominant emission mechanism .",
    "use this curvature to fit for the thermal fraction at 1 ghz and find 8% @xmath2 1% for a sample of 74 shapley - ames galaxies .",
    "however , a similar study by @xcite of 41 spiral galaxies reports a much larger variation in thermal fraction .",
    "this spectral decomposition method is difficult , since the power - law models often used may not be good approximations of the emission components .",
    "one such case against a power - law model is presented by @xcite , who favor a curved synchrotron spectrum to model the data .",
    "additionally , the synchrotron spectral index may be significantly steeper in some sources than the mean value typical of the galaxy population .",
    "other departures from the simple model are evident at low radio frequencies ( @xmath11 1 ghz ) , such as in the proto - typical starburst spectrum of m82 . in studies involving larger samples of galaxies",
    "there have been reports of flattening in the total spectrum , but the physical interpretation remains uncertain .",
    "several plausible scenarios have been proposed including thermal absorption of a power - law synchrotron component or intrinsic curvature in the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "for some ordinary galaxies , the case for thermal absorption appears to require unlikely physical parameters but plausible models have been presented for more extreme systems ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "models of the synchrotron spectrum are often based on a population of relativistic electrons with a power - law distribution of energy @xmath12 : @xmath13 .",
    "several energy - dependent processes can alter the shape of this particle distribution and thereby alter the shape of the synchrotron spectrum .",
    "these processes include ionization and electronic excitation @xcite , inverse compton , synchrotron radiation , and relativistic bremsstrahlung , although the latter is only weakly dependent on the particle s energy .",
    "the combined effect of these energy - dependent losses is that the initial power - law energy distribution ( and resulting synchrotron spectrum ) develops concave curvature , , steeper at the higher energies ( higher frequencies ) and flatter at lower energies ( lower frequencies ) .",
    "a family of more elaborate models can be developed by considering the time evolution of the the synchrotron - emitting cosmic ray electron ( cre ) population , often by invoking a ` single box ' with uniform particle and energy density , or a ` dynamical halo ' model consisting of a 2-d galactic disk with perpendicular wind . for injection which is constant in time ,",
    "these losses cause breaks of @xmath14 which manifest as breaks of @xmath15 in the synchrotron spectrum  note that these breaks are not sharp but rather represent asymptotic values for which the transition occurs over at least an order of magnitude in frequency ( for a graphical example , see @xcite , p. 121 ; also , @xcite ) .",
    "a low - frequency break ( flattening with decreasing energy or frequency ) is expected due to electronic excitation and ionization and a high - frequency break ( steepening with increasing energy or frequency ) results from inverse compton and synchrotron radiative losses ; under certain conditions , these breaks can fuse into a single observable with @xmath16 .",
    "additionally , energy - dependent cre re - acceleration and energy - dependent diffusion combined with advective escape can present observable spectral curvature .",
    "however , quantitative conclusions drawn from these models remain questionable since they do not consider the high degree of inhomogeneity in real galaxies .",
    "specifically , spatial variations in physical quantities such as density , magnetic field , cosmic ray injection , and interstellar radiation will result in spatial variations in the radio spectrum .",
    "since the integrated spectrum is the sum over these different regions , the spectral features predicted by simple models will be smeared out over a larger frequency range and it becomes difficult to relate characteristics of the integrated spectrum to a single set of physical quantities . due to these uncertainties , it is advantageous to explore additional relationships to better understand the nature of radio sources in galaxies .",
    "some trends have already been identified in previous studies , such as a relation between spectral index and galaxy morphological type ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* wherein early types have slightly flatter spectra ) , between spectral index and optical color ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wherein redder galaxies are slightly flatter ) , and spectral index versus optical axial ratio @xcite , although the latter two results have not been well established .",
    "it is the goal of this paper to better establish the shape of the integrated radio continuum spectrum below 5 ghz and to test for relationships between source properties . in order to achieve a substantially larger sample of galaxies than previous efforts , and to better guard against selection effects and background source confusion ,",
    "we have designed a new study to investigate the nature of low - frequency radio spectra using a suite of high - resolution survey data .",
    "we describe the properties of these surveys and the sample selection strategy in section  [ secsample ] .",
    "survey measurement techniques and derivation of additional source properties are detailed in section  [ secdata ] .",
    "the measured spectral indices and their relationships with source properties and ancillary data are presented in section  [ secresult ] and discussed in section  [ secdisc ] .",
    "we selected four northern - hemisphere large - area radio surveys as the basis for the spectral data : the vla low - frequency sky survey redux ( vlssr ; @xcite ) , the westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ; ) , the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ; @xcite ) , and the green bank 6 cm survey ( gb6 ; @xcite ) .",
    "table  [ table - survey - prop ] summarizes key properties of these surveys and figure  [ figtoon1 ] demonstrates how they sample the radio spectrum , from 74 mhz to 4.85 ghz , in roughly equal intervals .",

    "note that this restriction on optical size is important to ensure accurate measurements of the total flux from the radio surveys .",

    "since background confusion is known to be a serious concern ( the nvss catalog source density is 50 per square degree brighter than 2 mjy ) we adopt a radio - optical coherence length of @xmath25 to reject background sources with 99% confidence @xcite .",
    "additionally , we want to avoid background objects which could create confusion for the lower resolution surveys , so we reject sources having multiple radio components within @xmath26 of the optical position .",
    "a total of 197 galaxies are rejected on the basis of coherence length or multiple components .",
    "we also restrict our sample to include only radio sources for which the nvss - wenss 2-point spectral index can be well determined . based on simulated measurements with a standard @xmath27 spectral index , in order to achieve a measurement uncertainty",
    "@xmath28 we need to consider wenss sources @xmath29 ( nvss sources @xmath30 ) .",
    "furthermore , by setting a demanding nvss flux threshold , we can expect to detect these sources in the wenss survey even if they have atypical spectra .",
    "had we set a lower flux threshold , flat spectrum sources would have been too faint to be detected in wenss , leading to a preference for steeper spectrum sources in the final sample .",
    "a total of 321 galaxies are rejected for not having radio counterparts bright enough for our spectral investigation .",
    "a small number of additional galaxies are rejected due to issues obtaining one or more of the survey cutouts , or because the cutouts are severely contaminated by artifacts from a bright nearby source .",
    "after these selections , 250 galaxies remain in our final sample .",
    "since many galaxies in our sample have optical sizes larger than the survey resolution element , a 2-d gaussian fit at the full survey resolution may not provide the best estimate of the total flux @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the nvss and wenss survey cutouts are convolved with gaussian beams 2 , 3 , and 4 times larger than the native survey resolution to produce lower resolution images .",
    "the radio source is fit using the _ aips _ task jmfit for each scale ; if the source size is resolved and the integrated flux is at least 10% larger than the peak flux then the integrated flux is recorded , otherwise the peak flux is used .",

    "this method produces values which are on average 5.4% greater than those listed in the nvss catalog and 4.5% greater than values in the wenss catalog .",
    "the vlssr peak flux is measured from the full resolution survey cutout at the position of the optical source and corrected for beam resolution using the measured nvss size .",

    "we find a mean @xmath63  of -0.55 and dispersion between 0.10 and 0.20 depending on the degree of outlier rejection , resulting in a standard error in the mean of approximately 0.01 . a simulation incorporating the measured flux uncertainties is used to estimate the effect of measurement error on the dispersion in @xmath63 . by scaling each source to have the same spectral index as the mean of @xmath63  and resampling @xmath63  using a parametric uncertainty model , we construct the distribution we would expect to observe if each source had the same spectral index ( see the solid curve in figure  [ figamid ] ) . since the dispersion in this simulated distribution is approximately 0.05 , we find that much of the observed dispersion in @xmath63  is due to intrinsic variability within the population and can not be attributed to measurement error .",
    "the spectral index between the lowest frequency data in our study , @xmath62 , is calculated using flux measurements at 74 and 325 mhz ( vlssr - wenss ) .",
    "we choose to censor the vlssr flux measurements below 3@xmath32 for the purposes of calculating the spectral index and instead use the 3@xmath32 value to determine a lower limit to @xmath62 .",
    "we find a mean @xmath62  for the sample of @xmath65 , incorporating both the detections and limits with survival analysis ( see figure [ figalow ] ) .",
    "the dispersion , considering only the detections , is 0.37 .",
    "the low frequency flux ratio @xmath66 , defined as the ratio of vlssr to wenss flux , is also calculated for each source .",
    "the advantage of @xmath66  is that it has been tabulated along with an uncertainty for each source instead of being censored in the manner of @xmath62 .    between 1400 and 4850 mhz ( nvss - gb6 )",
    "we calculate @xmath64 , the spectral index between the highest frequency pair .",
    "the gb6 5@xmath32 declination - dependent upper limits are used to produce corresponding upper limits in @xmath64  when catalog fluxes are unavailable .",
    "a sample mean of @xmath67 ( see figure [ figahigh ] ) is determined using survival analysis , and the dispersion of the detections is 0.30 .",
    "the differences between mean values of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64  are tested for significance against the t - distribution , where the variance and effective degrees of freedom are estimated following procedures for samples with unequal variances .",
    "the change from @xmath62  to @xmath63  is suggestive but not highly significant , at a level of 95% , whereas the differences between @xmath63  and @xmath64  and between @xmath62  and @xmath64  are both deemed significant at a level greater than 99.9% .",
    "taken as a whole these results demonstrate that , across the entire frequency range of this study , the average spectrum of galaxies in our sample can not be well described by a single power law ; this amounts to a detection of curvature among the general population in our sample .",
    "the average spectrum can be approximated by a generic function with logarithmic curvature @xmath68 , where @xmath69 .",
    "for this function , the spectral index changes by a value @xmath70 for each logarithmic decade in frequency .",
    "a summary of these results is illustrated in figure [ figtoon2 ] , which shows a spectrum derived from the mean spectral indices .      in this section ,",
    "two independent methods are used to calculate the thermal fraction , @xmath51 , defined as the ratio of the free - free emission to the total radio continuum at 1.4 ghz , and the results are compared .",
    "the first method , discussed in section  [ addprop ] , uses the iras and nvss fluxes to produce the values of @xmath50@xmath51  which appear in table  [ table - data3 ] .",
    "the value of @xmath50@xmath51  can also be expressed as a function of the radio far - ir ratio @xmath54 as specified by equation  [ eqn - f - q ] .",
    "the distribution of these values of @xmath54 , and the corresponding values of @xmath50@xmath51 are displayed in figure  [ figftherm ] .",
    "the second method of calculating the thermal fraction is based on the model of power - law emission components , , synchrotron and free - free having spectral indices @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , as illustrated with figure  [ figtoon1 ] .",
    "the functional form of this model can be written as in equation  [ eqn - simp - model ] , @xmath73 where @xmath48 is the thermal fraction at a chosen reference frequency @xmath74 . by evaluating this model at @xmath75 mhz and @xmath76 ghz we derive the following expression for @xmath77@xmath51  as a function of @xmath63 : @xmath78 where the superscript ` r ' denotes that this value is derived solely from radio observations plus simple assumptions .",
    "equation  [ eqn - specific - model ] represents a process which is often referred to as spectral decomposition .",
    "some applications of spectral decomposition , having available a larger number of frequency measurements across a wider bandwidth , have allowed the synchrotron spectral index to be a free parameter ; here , we avoid this additional complexity in order to prevent a degenerate parameter space . note that our model does not satisfactorily explain observed spectral indices flatter than -0.1 or steeper than -0.8 , and as such we assign such observations thermal fractions of 100% and 0% , respectively .    in figure  [ figftherm - vs - q ] , the distribution of @xmath50@xmath51  ( from equation  [ eqn - ftherm14 ] )",
    "is compared to the distribution of @xmath77@xmath51   ( calculated with equation  [ eqn - specific - model ] ) .",
    "we find no correlation between the thermal fractions estimated from these independent methods .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath50@xmath51  are narrowly distributed with a median of 9% and dispersion 3% , and agree well with the expected values from prior studies , while the values of @xmath77@xmath51  are , on average , much larger and have much greater variation ( mean 51% and dispersion 26% ) .",
    "the values produced by spectral decomposition are unsatisfying for several reasons , most notably the large mean and dispersion , and failure to properly account for spectral indices outside the interval @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "this suggests that the spectral decomposition model given by equation  [ eqn - simp - model ] is an inadequate description of the spectra below 1 ghz .",
    "we investigate relations between the tabulated source properties ( , spectral measurements , fir - derived quantities and additional data ) and the numerical hubble type .",
    "the data are binned by morphological types e , l , sa , sb , sc , and sd / i and the bin means and standard errors are used to determine the significance level of correlation . after reviewing a large number of possible correlations , we present in this section the results deemed most relevant to this study .",
    "first , we discuss the observed relation between @xmath54 and numerical hubble type , shown in figure  [ type - corr1 ] . taken as a whole , the early - type ( e and l ) galaxies in our sample",
    "have significantly smaller values of @xmath54 than spiral types sa through sd .",
    "while the late types in our sample typically have values of @xmath54 consistent with the expected value for ordinary star - forming galaxies , many early types in our sample have ` radio - excess ' values of @xmath54 which can be an indicator of agn activity @xcite .",
    "we identify a relationship between the numerical hubble type and our radio compactness parameter , the ratio of the radio to optical major axis diameter ( see figure  [ type - corr2 ] ) . on average , the early - type galaxies in this sample harbor radio sources which are smaller with respect to the optical host as compared with later morphological types .",
    "there also exists substantial variation in compactness within the sub - population of spiral types sa to sd , where the later tends to be more extended than the former .",
    "one possible explanation is that the star formation in late types is more distributed throughout the optical disk but is more nucleated in early types ; alternatively , the radio emission from early types may be due in part to a low - luminosity agn .",
    "a relationship between compactness and radio surface brightness is also identified , although this may be due in part to selection effects from using a flux threshold .",
    "we test for a relationship between @xmath63  and hubble type , but do not identify a significant trend in our data ( see figure  [ type - corr3 ] ) .",
    "this is an unexpected result considering that some prior studies have detected such a relation ( , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although they typically used data at higher frequencies to calculate the spectral index . additionally , the distributions of @xmath54 and the compactness parameter ( see figures [ type - corr1 ] and [ type - corr2 ] ) suggest that the radio sources in early types may have different properties or be driven by different processes",
    ". however , it appears from our results that the magnitude of the spectral index across the frequency range used for @xmath63  ( 325 - 1400 mhz ) is not sensitive to these differences .",
    "relationships between spectral measurements ( , @xmath63  and @xmath66 ) and various additional source properties are investigated in order to better understand the physical processes which shape the radio spectrum .",
    "transformations are applied to the data and outliers are rejected , when necessary , to better meet the requirements of normality before testing for correlations .",
    "for continuous variables , the significance of the relation is judged using pearson s correlation coefficient .",
    "significant trends are detected between the steepness of the spectral slope ( using either @xmath63  and @xmath66 ) and the source luminosity ( using either nvss or iras ) .",
    "in each case the steeper spectra are correlated with sources having higher luminosity .",
    "one such example is shown in figure  [ amid - corr2 ] , the case of @xmath63  versus the log of nvss luminosity , in which we have only considered sources with hubble flow distances greater than 20 mpc and luminosities less than @xmath79 , for @xmath80 in [ w hz@xmath58 ] .",
    "the equation of the regression line determined from these data is @xmath63  @xmath82 .",
    "one particular relation which has been discussed in previous studies is between the low frequency spectral index and optical axial ratio ( as a proxy for galaxy inclination ) , motivated by observation as well as geometric models of thermal absorption .",
    "we test our data for relationships between the optical inclination , as derived from the optical axial ratio , and spectral properties @xmath63  and @xmath66 . in pursuit of a better parameter to gauge the amount of expected thermal absorption , we quantify the projected path length through the galaxy disk by using our knowledge of the optical size , inclination , hubble flow distance , and assuming disk scale height equal to 10% of the diameter .",
    "we also test both the full galaxy sample as well as a subset containing only hubble types sa to sc , since this subset is expected to better conform to our disk model .",
    "we find no significant relationships for any of these combinations ; one example , @xmath63  versus inclination angle , is provided with figure  [ amid - corr1 ] .",
    "a final test of considerable interest is @xmath63  versus @xmath50@xmath51  ( see figure [ amid - corr3 ] ) from the simple model of power - law thermal and non - thermal emission , , figure  [ figtoon1 ] , a flatter spectral index is expected to correlate with increasing thermal fraction , but no such relationship is detected .",
    "this indicates that the simple model of optically - thin power - law components does not provide an adequate description of the spectral index @xmath63 ; this issue is discussed in greater detail in section  [ secdisc ] .    after reviewing a large number of possible correlations between spectral properties ( table  [ table - data2 ] ) and the tabulated source properties ( tables [ table - data3 ] and [ table - data4 ] ) and rejecting those which could be attributed to selection effects , only the relation between spectral index and luminosity is found to be significant",
    "a number of supplemental tests are also conducted using optical colors b - v and u - b , the ratio of the 60 and 100   fluxes , the radio axial ratio and the difference between radio and optical position angles , but no significant trends are identified .",
    "for most galaxies in our sample , the fractional sensitivity for our set of flux measurements is not adequate to distinguish the standard power - law model from alternatives based on goodness - of - fit statistics .",
    "for this reason , we focus not on fitting the individual galaxy spectra but instead on descriptive population statistics .",
    "this section discusses our interpretation of ( 1 ) the mean values of the spectral index and generalized curvature , ( 2 ) the dispersion in the distribution of @xmath63 , and ( 3 ) relationships between spectral characteristics of the radio emission and additional source properties .    from the distributions of @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64",
    ", we find that there is low frequency curvature present in the radio spectra of galaxies .",
    "comparing our result to the average spectra of the sample , we find that we agree asymptotically at the high frequency part of the spectrum but diverge at lower frequencies .",
    "one possible explanation is that the sample suffers from selection effects approximately 40% of their original volume limited sample was discarded because of non - detections at the lowest frequency .",
    "other studies such as the one by @xcite , which extends down to 57.5 mhz , found that spectral curvature in the form of low frequency flattening is not uncommon in spiral galaxies .",
    "therefore we conclude that low frequency galaxy spectra are , on average , better modeled by a function having logarithmic curvature than by a single power law .",
    "we find that @xmath83 per logarithmic frequency decade is the approximate magnitude for this curvature within our sample .",
    "there are a number of physical mechanisms which could potentially produce this spectral curvature . here , we consider ( 1 ) free - free absorption of a synchrotron power law , and ( 2 ) a curved synchrotron spectrum resulting from curvature in the underlying distribution of cres .",
    "it appears unlikely that free - free absorption can effect much of the spectrum for this sample of normal galaxies , as this would require a plasma with a large emission measure and a large covering factor .",
    "although compact hii regions have been found to emit optically thick free - free emission at frequencies @xmath61 10 ghz , these are preferentially found in dense starburst galaxies and do not cover a large fraction of the source . on the other hand , the hot ism has a large covering factor but can not produce the required emission measures given typical sizes and densities .",
    "therefore , we conclude that thermal absorption of power - law synchrotron emission can not be the primary mechanism which produces the observed curvature",
    ".    we also want to discuss some of the physical mechanisms which could be responsible for a curved synchrotron spectrum . here , we adopt a model where cosmic rays are injected into the system with a power - law energy distribution  shock acceleration , where the injection index @xmath84 ( for example , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the synchrotron spectral index from this ` young ' electron distribution is @xmath85 which is in good agreement with the spectral index of supernova remnants ( , * ?",
    "one description of the spectral curvature detected in the average spectrum ( see [ figtoon2 ] ) is that we are observing a gradual transition from the injection index to a steeper spectrum at higher frequencies .",
    "this spectral behavior is typically associated with radiative losses ( , synchrotron and inverse compton ) , for which the loss rate is proportional to the cre energy . however",
    ", strong radiative cooling ( an essential component in many r - fir models ) alone would produce a power - law spectrum with a much steeper spectral index @xmath86 .",
    "here , we propose two scenarios under which radiative cooling could produce the observed curvature . for one ,",
    "the radiative cooling could transition from weak , at the lower frequencies , and become stronger at the higher observed frequencies . in this scenario ,",
    "electrons radiating below about 1 ghz would need to be younger than their radiative lifetime .",
    "alternatively , the curvature could be produced by the combination of strong radiative losses and another loss mechanism such as ionization or relativistic bremsstrahlung . in this second scenario ,",
    "the energy loss rates of these processes would need to be comparable for electrons radiating near 1 ghz .",
    "some studies have used the integrated spectrum to estimate physical parameters such as the density and magnetic field .",
    "for example , @xcite compares the results of several models applied to the spectrum of m82 .",
    "however , the variability of these results emphasizes that the estimated parameters depend upon the details of the models and their incorporated assumptions .",
    "an additional consideration which is often neglected when analyzing the total radio spectrum is the effect of inhomogeneous sources .",
    "it is known that the physical conditions within galaxies ( , sfr , density , temperature , magnetic field , interstellar radiation field ) vary as a function of position , and consequently , cre injection , radiation and cre energy loss mechanisms also vary accordingly .",
    "if different regions within the source produce distinctly different spectra , then the uniform ` single box ' models may not be adequate to interpret the net spectrum of these regions .",
    "a number of observations have demonstrated the high degree of inhomogeneity in star forming systems , including spatial variations of the radio spectrum .",
    "additionally , a new study of the resolved radio continuum of two nearby galaxies @xcite demonstrates the importance of inhomogeneities in shaping the integrated spectrum .",
    "for these reasons , we elect not to pursue this type of quantitive interpretation of the spectral results .",
    "the origin of the observed dispersion in @xmath63  is another point of considerable interest .",
    "on one hand , the dispersion is small enough that it would appear that the physical conditions among the majority of galaxies in our sample are remarkably similar . yet on the other hand , this distribution is broad enough that we can not explain it solely by measurement uncertainty alone , indicating that some galaxies have intrinsically steeper or flatter spectra than the average .    one possible model which can address the intrinsic dispersion in @xmath63  involves a thermal fraction which varies within the sample , such that low @xmath51  sources have spectra which resemble the underlying non - thermal spectrum ( @xmath87 ) and high @xmath51  sources have spectra which approach a purely free - free spectrum ( @xmath88 ) .",
    "the right skew present in the distribution of @xmath63  would further support this explanation .",
    "however , we do not detect correlations between @xmath50@xmath51  and @xmath63  or @xmath66  as would be predicted by such a model . additionally , the large thermal fractions needed to explain the typical @xmath63  values near -0.55 , based on the decomposition model of equation  [ eqn - specific - model ] , are much higher than those found in similar studies .",
    "several other factors may contribute to the dispersion in @xmath63 .",
    "we considered the effect of the relation between spectral index and radio luminosity , but this only accounts for a small fraction of the @xmath63  dispersion . despite testing a large number of potential correlations",
    ", we were unable to identify any additional relationships with which to illuminate the nature of this dispersion .",
    "the source s star formation history may also play an important role in determining the spectral index ; variations of the constant - injection model of synchrotron spectral aging predict that post - starburst galaxies will have significantly steeper spectra while sources whose star formation rate is increasing with time will have flatter spectra .",
    "although we tested for and found no relationships between @xmath63  and optical colors u - b and b - v , a more accurate measure of star formation history may be necessary to reveal such a relationship if it exists .",
    "galaxy mass is another source property which we were unable to test for , and may affect the spectral index as discussed by .",
    "there are a small number of outliers in the @xmath63  distribution ( see figure  [ figamid ] ) which we have tried to better understand . here",
    ", we discuss 16 outliers identified as having values of @xmath63  outside the interval ( -1,0 ) .",
    "we find that their uncertainties are not significantly larger than the average uncertainties in the sample , and as such , their differences from the sample mean are highly significant .",
    "we also find that these outliers are much more likely to lack iras identifications ( 38% ) when compared to the rest of the distribution ( 9% ) .",
    "for the outliers which have iras detections , their mean value of @xmath54 is 1.97 , which , compared with the distribution of @xmath54 from @xcite , is about 3@xmath32 away from the mean value ( on the radio - loud side ) .",
    "since these outliers are , on average , radio loud , it is plausible that those lacking iras identifications are also radio - loud ( . too faint to be included in the iras catalog ) .",
    "there is also the issue of nvss source identifications , for which we accepted approximately 1% background radio sources not associated with the optical galaxy ; this would lead to @xmath9  8 objects in our sample which are likely to be background agn .",
    "some spectral index outliers may instead be the result of agn in our target sources themselves .",
    "further investigation of these spectral index outliers reveals that more than 60% can be classified as agn based on catalog cross - referencing and examination of very high resolution radio continuum images .",
    "moreover , we find that over 60% of 22 outliers in the @xmath54 distribution can also be associated with agn using these same techniques .",
    "from the tested correlations with hubble type , we find several distinguishing characteristics within our sample : the radio sources in early types appear to be more compact , have higher surface brightness and have excess radio emission as compared to infrared emission .",
    "nevertheless , the mean spectral index of radio sources in our early types appears to be the same as the mean spectral index of radio sources in spiral types .",
    "therefore , it would appear that the magnitude of the spectral index can not be used to probe the physical nature of the radio source unless the spectral index takes on extreme values indicative of purely thermal or non - thermal processes",
    ".    one of the primary goals at the outset of this investigation was to measure relationships between source properties and spectral characteristics in order to better understand how the radio continuum spectrum is related to a source s physical conditions and star formation history .",
    "however , this analysis was limited by the sensitivity of current large - area radio survey data , which is not adequate to accurately measure spectral curvature for individual objects in our sample . new large - area radio surveys with enhanced frequency coverage and sensitivity",
    "are highly desirable to improve the detection statistics and extend the range over which the spectrum can be analyzed .",
    "additionally , improving the spatial resolution of the spectral data may provide an important probe of the source s physical nature .",
    "furthermore , it may be necessary to expand the set of source properties ( , gravitational potential , ism density , magnetic field strength , wind velocity ) to identify stronger correlations .",
