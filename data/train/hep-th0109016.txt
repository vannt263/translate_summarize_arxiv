    "the gross - neveu model in 2 + 1 dimensions is well - known to exhibit dynamically symmetry breaking whenever the four - fermion coupling exceeds some critical value . about a decade ago renewed interest in the gross - neveu model led to a number of papers establishing the renormalizability of the gross - neveu model and related models in the @xmath2 expansion due to the presence of a finite ultraviolet stable fixed point and conformal invariance at this critical point @xcite .",

    "only the tad - pole graph contributes in the leading large @xmath0 limit , see fig .",
    "[ fig_trunc ] . at a first glance",
    "this might seem inconsistent , since parts of the fermion propagator are now described by different truncations .",

    "interestingly , the solutions of the truncated system depicted in fig .  [ fig_trunc ]",
    "satisfy the hyperscaling equations for arbitrary but finite @xmath0 .",
    "however , we can not say with certainty that the values obtained in eq .",
    "( [ sumofexp ] ) are the correct critical exponents to order @xmath2 , without a thorough investigation of the @xmath198 diagrams for the yukawa vertex",
    ". examples of such @xmath2 yukawa vertex corrections are depicted in fig .  [ fig_next2leading ] .",
    "the factors of @xmath0 depicted in this figure represent index - loops which can be straightforwardly determined , using t hoofts double line representation ( as explained in the appendix ) .",
    "suppressing factors of @xmath2 appear in the following way . from section  [ sec_scalbeh ] , using eqs .",
    "( [ bospropcrit ] ) and ( [ bnearzhalf ] ) , we find that the @xmath8 boson propagator at the critical coupling has the approximate form @xmath199 the eigenvalue equation ( [ zetaapprox ] ) identifies a factor of @xmath2 with @xmath200 ( @xmath201 ) .",
    "hence , each internal full @xmath8 boson line in a feynman diagram carries a suppressing factor @xmath2 .",
    "this illustrates that the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig_next2leading ] are indeed of order @xmath2 . now",
    "the factor @xmath200 or @xmath2 is related to the yukawa coupling @xmath202 mentioned in the appendix . since a four - fermion scattering amplitude , exchanging a virtual @xmath8 boson would correspond to a factor @xmath203 , we can associate the square of the yukawa coupling with @xmath2 , @xmath204 , so that the factors @xmath205 are indeed of order one , in retrospect . using the above observation that each internal @xmath8 boson propagator corresponds to a factor @xmath2 and each index - loop to a factor @xmath0 , it is straightforward to verify that the vertex corrections depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_next2leading ] are order @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , diagrams containing fermion loops with an odd number of out - going @xmath8 lines are zero in the subcritical regime , due to restrictions imposed by the symmetry of the model .",
    "if @xmath206 , we should get the exponents within the accuracy of the approximation .",
    "it turned out , however , that at @xmath206 , @xmath106 and no pure power - law expression exists for the @xmath8 boson propagator ( see eq .",
    "( [ pilog ] ) ) .",
    "this logarithmic deviation from the power - law behavior causes the violation of hyperscaling and consequently spoils the renormalizability of the model .",
    "such a violation could be a sign that the @xmath2 expansion is at the most an asymptotic expansion , since continuation to negative values of @xmath207 are physically meaningless .",
    "but at the moment , this is a mere hypothesis .",
    "nevertheless , when we take finite but large @xmath0 then the model does have power - law renormalizability and respects hyperscaling .",
    "the main question remains whether the exponents in eq .",
    "( [ sumofexp ] ) are correct to order @xmath2 . in order to settle this question adequately one needs to investigate the @xmath2 corrections to the yukawa vertex .",
    "we can think of three scenarios .",
    "1 . the next - to - leading @xmath2 corrections as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_next2leading ] are finite and will contribute only to the `` conformal invariant '' or scale invariant part of the yukawa vertex and do not alter its scaling dimension .",
    "this so - called scale invariant part of the yukawa vertex depends only on the ratios of the in- and out - going momenta .",
    "2 . each of the diagrams depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_next2leading ] is logarithmically divergent and the infinite sum of such diagrams give rise to a new scaling dimension of order @xmath2 for the yukawa vertex .",
    "3 . the @xmath2 expansion breaks down due to the appearance of kinematic factors such as @xmath208 terms , which give rise to additional factors of @xmath0 and render the whole idea of topological @xmath2 expansion meaningless . in case that scenario 1 would turn out to be correct ,",
    "then the set of critical exponents ( [ sumofexp ] ) will be correct to order @xmath2 .",
    "scenario 2 leads to an anomalous dimension for the yukawa vertex of order @xmath2 and the expressions for the critical exponents and anomalous dimension are only valid in the leading order and up to logarithmic accuracy . in case",
    "that scenario 3 unfolds , our analytical approach has failed , since then we lost track of the perturbative parameter @xmath2 and no standard techniques , except perhaps lattice simulations , are adequate to tackle the critical behavior of the presented model . by the way , each of three scenarios can be reconciled with the full conformal symmetry at the critical point of four - fermion models as advocated in ref .",
    "in this paper we have studied various aspects of dynamical symmetry breaking su(@xmath0)@xmath23u(1 ) in a specific su(@xmath0 ) four - fermion model in the large @xmath0 limit in 2 + 1 dimensions , by making use of t hoofts topological @xmath2 expansion .",
    "we advocated the applicability of t hoofts topological @xmath2 expansion to the presented model . within the adopted @xmath2 expansion ,",
    "the yukawa vertex was approximated by its bare form .",
    "the main result of this paper is the determination of the exponent @xmath55 or anomalous dimension of the fermion wave function @xmath31 as a function of @xmath0 in the planar approximation at the critical point @xmath52 . the functional relationship between @xmath55 and @xmath0 given in eq .  ( [ lameq ] ) and fig .  [ fig_zetavsinvn ] .",
    "the approximate relationship was found to be @xmath209 .",
    "subsequently the critical coupling @xmath51 and various critical exponents are given in terms of the exponent @xmath55 .",
    "in the large @xmath0 limit , the critical exponents for this su(@xmath0 ) invariant four - fermion model differ considerably from the critical exponents of the gross - neveu model .",
    "the presence of @xmath1 light composite bosons turned out to drastically changes the scaling behavior of the fermion propagator in the vicinity of the critical point , giving rise to a new three dimensional universality class , see eq .",
    "( [ univclass ] ) .",
    "similar to the 2 + 1 dimensional gross - neveu model , the presented model is nonperturbatively renormalizable for large but finite @xmath0 . the obtained anomalous dimensions of the fermion and @xmath8 boson propagators are self - consistent with the bare yukawa vertex approximation .    for the future , it could be interesting to extend the presented approach to arbitrary space - time dimension @xmath4 in order to investigate the perseverance of triviality at the upper critical dimension @xmath210 .",
    "in this appendix , we illustrate the applicability of t hoofts topological @xmath2 expansion to our model lagrangian ( [ sunffm ] ) . as is explicitly mentioned in ref .",
    "@xcite , the topological expansion is also valid for models , with a global u(@xmath0 ) symmetry , having scalar fields with two u(@xmath0 ) indices ( _ i.e. _ , the adjoint representation ) .",
    "therefore , for large @xmath0 , we generalize the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry to u(@xmath0 ) .",
    "subsequently , we perform a hubbard - stratonovich transformation , after which the lagrangian ( [ sunffm ] ) is expressed in terms of hermitian scalar fields @xmath211 , @xmath212 with the flavor or `` color '' indices @xmath213 , @xmath173 running from @xmath214 to @xmath0 .",
    "contrary to the qcd and u(@xmath0 ) gauge theories , `` physical '' observables are not restricted to be `` color '' blind .",
    "in other words , external fields or sources are allowed to carry u(@xmath0 ) flavor indices .",

    "now the scalar fields @xmath42 are analogous to the gluon gauge fields of ref .",
    "@xcite , carrying two u(@xmath0 ) indices , and consequently the topological @xmath2 expansion can be applied .",
    "moreover , due to the absence cubic and quartic self interactions for the auxiliary scalar fields , the `` flavor '' feynman rules are considerably simpler than the corresponding rules for the u(@xmath0 ) gauge field theories .    these flavor feynman rules for the u(@xmath0 ) symmetric phase are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_flavorfrul ] , using the double line representation of t hooft , see also ref .",
    "each index loop in a feynman diagram gives rise to factor @xmath0 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_flavorfrul ] , the propagators are fully dressed .",
    "this is necessarily so , because of the fact that in a critical theory , with relevant four - fermion interactions close to or at a critical point , the vacuum polarization @xmath39 is of a comparable magnitude as the bare mass term @xmath218 .",
    "the fermion self - energy @xmath38 is of the order of the canonical or free form @xmath219 or larger ( this will be shown in sec .  [ sec_scalbeh ] ) . at the critical point",
    "the bare mass term @xmath218 of the @xmath8 boson propagator @xmath142 is canceled by the momentum independent @xmath8 boson vacuum polarization ( @xmath39 ) corrections and the remaining momentum dependent terms give rise to the anomalous scaling law for the scalar propagator . for the fermion propagator a similar argument holds , see also sec .",
    "[ sec_scalbeh ] .",
    "for @xmath220 the leading @xmath2 expansion for u(@xmath0 ) gauge theories consists of complicated planar networks of gluon exchanges .",
    "this is mainly due to the local nature of the symmetry , which introduces cubic and quartic gluon self - couplings and gauge - fixing interactions , whose particular structure depends on the space - time dimension . for @xmath221 , t hooft showed that the set of planar diagrams can be reduced to self - energy and ladder diagrams . as a consequence , the sdes form a closed set and",
    "the @xmath221 gauge theory is solvable in the leading @xmath2 expansion .",
    "contrary to the local u(@xmath0 ) symmetries , the topological @xmath2 expansion is not space - time dependent for the global u(@xmath0 ) symmetries of our interest , merely because of the absence of gauge fixing constraints or faddeev - popov ghosts .",
    "the space - time dimension @xmath4 does not play a role in the selection rules for the planarity and thus the large @xmath0 behavior of feynman diagrams for global u(@xmath0 ) . for internal @xmath8 boson exchanges",
    "is does not matter whether we use the real representation or the hermitian representation for the composite fields to leading order in @xmath2 , since @xmath222 \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\delta_{\\gamma\\delta},\\label{delshermreal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath1 propagators @xmath21 are degenerate , @xmath223 , and @xmath224 is the propagator of the u(1 ) field @xmath225 . in general @xmath226 , thus from eq .",
    "( [ delshermreal ] ) it follows that the double line representation of the @xmath8 boson propagator is violated at the most by a @xmath2 suppressed term .",
    "the planar expansion for the present 2 + 1 dimensional model is equivalent to the planar expansion for the @xmath221 u(@xmath0 ) gauge theory or t hooft model , since both models have a single interaction vertex , see fig .",
    "[ fig_sdeplanar ] .",
    "this planarity can be verified order by order in the diagrammatic expansion of full @xmath8 propagators @xmath36 .",
    "we assume that with each internal full @xmath8 boson exchange in a feynman diagram an `` effective '' yukawa coupling , @xmath202 is associated .",
    "we assume that combination @xmath205 is fixed and of the order of one @xcite , so that all diagrams with powers of @xmath227 are of the same order and need to be summed nonperturbatively .",
    "the assumption that @xmath205 is fixed for @xmath137 can only be validated in retrospect , since @xmath202 is not a free parameter like the gauge coupling @xmath192 in qcd ; @xmath202 is self - consistently determined from the planar sdes and therefore depends on @xmath0 and @xmath228 . for the @xmath8 boson vacuum polarization @xmath39 , each planar diagram with @xmath229 internal exchanges of @xmath8 bosons is associated with a factor @xmath230 . for the fermion self - energy @xmath38 ,",
    "each planar diagram with @xmath229 @xmath8 exchanges also corresponds to a factor @xmath231 .",
    "examples of vacuum diagrams with different topology ( planar , hole , handle ) are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_planholhan ] .    for the fermion self energy ,",
    "the planar expansion is generated by the rainbow approximation .",
    "moreover for the present model , a certain class of planar diagrams can be neglected .",
    "this class comprises all planar diagrams , which can be identified as vertex corrections .",
    "this can be understood in the following way . as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_sdeplanar ] , a full yukawa vertex can either connect the left upper in - going line in @xmath39 with a right upper outgoing line , or connect the upper left line with the lower left line . whereas the bare vertex corresponds to the former , the ladder vertex corrections correspond to the latter . since the generator @xmath232 is the only generator having a nonzero trace , it is straightforward to check that diagrams connecting upper left lines with lower left lines give only nonzero contributions to the propagator @xmath224 of the u(1 ) field , thereby causing the inequality @xmath233 .",
    "for instance , in the real representation , the vacuum polarization @xmath234 of the propagator @xmath21 gets a two - loop vertex correction which is proportional to @xmath235 .",
    "this trace vanishes , except for @xmath236 . using eq .",
    "( [ delshermreal ] ) in the fermion self energy , it follows that the contribution of @xmath224 is suppressed by a factor @xmath35 with respect to the degenerate su(@xmath0 ) propagator @xmath36 .",
