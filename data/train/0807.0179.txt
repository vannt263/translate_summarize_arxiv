    "we consider as significant those peaks for which the post - trial probability is lower than @xmath18 , equivalent to a deviation of 5@xmath19 from the gaussian noise case .",
    "we scan all natural frequencies , with an oversampling factor of 5 .",

    "then , we fold the lc into a _ phaseogram _ using the period @xmath22 . the phaseogram is produced using 50 bins , to ensure a smooth description of the waveform .",

    "a second , also strong , component with period @xmath11000  d is present in both data samples .",
    "this corresponds to a long - term modulation of the x - ray flux with respect to the 326  d oscillation , but can not be established as periodic since the period is similar to the total time spanned by the observations .",
    "an alternative explanation to the @xmath11000  d period will be given below .",
    "finally , a third component is seen in 2 data sample at period @xmath15.6  d , compatible with the orbital modulation , visible in the periodogram ( figure  [ fig : asm_swift_per ] ) even before prewhitening .",
    "this modulation is not seen in  data , for which @xmath28 . on a similar energy band",
    ", @xcite claimed a modulation compatible with the orbital period in  lc between april 1991 and september 1996 , but the method used lacks of a mathematical justification .",
    "@xcite did not find any evidence for the orbital modulation in  data between may 1996 and september 1998 .",
    "finally , @xcite , using the whole batse light curve , reported a deviation of @xmath29 from the gaussian noise case , insufficient to establish the presence of the orbital modulation in the data .",
    "we have searched  and  lcs for periodic modulations and found peaks at p=(276@xmath03 )  d and p=(288@xmath03 )  d , respectively ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) , in agreement with the results obtained by @xcite and @xcite . by comparison with the p=(326@xmath03 )  d present in and 2 lc , this shows that the period of the super - orbital modulation is variable .",
    "the corresponding phaseograms are shown if figure  [ fig : phaseogram ] ( two lowermost panels ) . even if the relative dispersion of the points is larger due to the lower sensitivity of  and , the waveform is still visible .",
    "they follow a very similar shape as those found for  and 2 , albeit for a different period , as one expects if the underlying physical process is the same .",
    "the correlation factor for  and  ( ) phaseograms is @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "however , the modulation amplitudes are significantly lower than for the case of .",
    "this could have a physical explanation , but it could also happen if the periodic modulation was not present in part of the lcs , which can be certainly not excluded . on the other hand , we do not find evidence for the orbital period in  or  lcs ] .",
    "it is worth noting that , given  and  sensitivities , we do not expect to detect an orbital modulation with an amplitude of @xmath15@xmath32 as the one we see in 2 data .",
    "the mean relative variance of the data points in the phaseogram ( which is a good estimate of the measurement error ) are @xmath33 and @xmath34 for  and respectively .",
    "both values are well above the @xmath35 modulation which is hence difficult to detect .",
    "we have crosschecked this by analyzing monte carlo ( mc ) simulated lcs for and .",
    "we use the same sampling as the measured lcs and simulate a @xmath35 amplitude modulation convolved with @xmath33 and @xmath34 point - to - point random fluctuations , respectively . the analysis of these lcs yields no significant peak .",

    "the latter corresponds to the orbital modulation , whereas the other four seem to denote a complex power spectrum .",
    "we stress that some of these peaks have been found in previous studies of the  lc @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the super - orbital modulation can be greatly simplified if we consider that the period can change along the observation time in a discrete way .",
    "we have analyzed separately the data between each two consecutive soft or failed transition states , i.e.  three samples , namely 1a=[5032850644 ] , 1b=[5065351001 ] and 1c=[5102751368 ] ( see figure  [ fig : asma_lc ] ) .",

    "we prewhiten the leading frequency in each of the subsamples and merge them to look for sub - leading frequencies .",
    "the only remaining significant peak corresponds to the orbital modulation ( see table  [ tab : results ] ) .",

    "the general agreement with the data is remarkably good .",
    "we have also generated three mc samples corresponding to the samplings of 1a , 1b and 1c subsamples , and pure sinusoidal modulations with the periods found for each of them , convolved with the measured point - to - point fluctuations .",
    "then we have merged the three samples together and analyzed the resulting lc .",
    "we obtain significant peaks at p = ( 147@xmath01 ) , ( 190@xmath02 ) and ( 523@xmath012 )  d , in surprisingly good agreement with the results of analyzing the real data .",
    "we note that this effect could be also responsible of the @xmath11000  d periodicity of the  and 2 data , since they also contain a soft state episode that might have changed the period of the super - orbital modulation prior to mjd=53780 .",
    "we find that  displays a super - orbital modulation , with a period that changes , probably in a discrete way and in coincidence with soft or failed state - transition phases , over time scales ranging from a few hundred days to several years .",
    "according to our findings , the very much cited @xmath1150  d period is most probably an artifact of applying a ( sometimes biased ) fourier - transform based analysis to a data sample where more than one consecutive period modulations are present . since 2005 ,  shows a very powerful and stable super - orbital modulation with a period of @xmath46  d.    the super - orbital modulation is usually attributed to the precession of the accretion disk  @xcite and relativistic jet  @xcite , as a result of the tidal forces exerted by the companion star on a tilted disk  @xcite .",
    "a mechanism for keeping the disk tilted can be provided by radiation pressure warping  @xcite . in the case of tidally",
    "forced precession , the expected period @xmath47 depends on the outer radius @xmath48 and inclination of the disk @xmath49 as @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "then , the longer the period the larger the precession angle , and hence also a larger modulation amplitude is expected .",
    "this is in agreement with our results for , where we have found four different super - orbital periods , which follow this tendency ( see table  [ tab : results ] and figure  [ fig : asma_lc ] ) .",
    "a different issue is why the precession of the disk produces a modulation in the x - ray flux .",
    "some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have considered the possibility that the precession movement changes the optical thickness along the line of sight .",
    "they reject this possibility since it seems unlikely due to the fine tuning required to produce the observed modulation amplitude , which in addition should depend on the energy , which is not confirmed by our observations .",
    "the multiwavelenth data seem to support a scenario where the emission itself is anisotropic .",
    "the precession modulation is detected at similar times with identical periods in radio , soft and hard x - rays during the hard state .",
    "a unified picture , where the anisotropy is provided by the jet , has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "the soft x - ray emission is produced in the disk via bremsstrahlung of thermal electrons , and are then up - scattered to higher energies via compton scattering in the hot corona or at the base of the relativistic jet ( which precesses with the disk ) .",
    "the acceleration of electrons along magnetic field lines in the jet produces the radio emission by synchrotron emission . during the soft state ,",
    "the jet and corona dissappear and no modulation is observed .",
    "according to our findings , once the source goes back to the hard state , the reconstructed disk and jet have different kinematical properties , and the modulation period changes .",
    "it seems that failed transitions produce a similar effect .",
    "magic detected a fast and intense episode of emission of gamma - rays above 100  gev @xcite during mjd=54003 , albeit at the limit of the telescope s sensitivity .",
    "this happened in coincidence with the soft and hard x - ray maxima ( figures  [ fig : asm_swift_lc ] and [ fig : phaseogram ] ) and an unusually bright outburst detected with _ integral _",
    "it is interesting to note that , according to the ephemeris shown in table  [ tab : results ] , the next passage for the precession maximum will happen at mjd=54655@xmath02 , i.e. between 6 and 10 of july 2008 . the observational conditions of  with ground - based cherenkov telescopes , such as magic and veritas , will be optimal during those days ."
