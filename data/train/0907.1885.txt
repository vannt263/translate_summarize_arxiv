    "we utilize concepts from graph theory to construct an edge - weighted laplacian matrix whose weights correspond to the first - order spring constant for small oscillations about the equilibrium position . in section",
    "iii we apply the symmetry constraints on the equilibrium conditions and develop the properties of the edge weights @xmath2 for this physical situation .",
    "we use these properties to prove that our dynamical matrix is a laplacian matrix that is also symmetrically circulant . in section",
    "iv we build on results from gutirrez - gutirrez@xcite to find the eigenvalues for a weighted laplacian symmetrically circulant matrix .",
    "finally , in section v , we comment on the properties of the eigenvalues , the largest and smallest frequencies , and the limiting behavior as @xmath0 becomes large .",
    "since we limit the scope of this paper to the situation where the particle filling is low enough that there is only a single ring of particles with radius @xmath4 in the equilibrium state , when we talk about larger numbers of particles , we assume that the trapping potential has been appropriately scaled to maintain this condition .",

    "@xmath9 it is natural to use polar coordinates , @xmath10 because of the radially symmetric potential .",

    "the particles are equally distributed around the circle such that the difference in the angular position between any two particles is a multiple of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore an arbitrary particle identified by the index @xmath5 has an equilibrium angular position of @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the arbitrary starting point on the circle ( given by the angle of the first particle ) .",
