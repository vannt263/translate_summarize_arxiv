    "it is well known that for bodies separated by @xmath2 the radiative heat transfer between them is described by the stefan- bolzman law : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the temperatures of solid @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . in this limiting case the heat transfer is connected with traveling electromagnetic waves radiated by the bodies , and does not depend on the separation @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath8 the heat transfer increases by many order of magnitude , which can be explained by the existence of evanescent electromagnetic field that decay exponentially into the vacuum . at present time",
    "there is an increasing number of investigations of heat transfer due to evanescent waves in connection with scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning thermal microscopy ( stm ) under ultrahigh vacuum conditions @xcite .",
    "stm can be used for local heating of the surface , resulting in local desorption or decomposition of molecular species , and this offer further possibilities for the stm to control local chemistry on a surface .",
    "a general formalism for evaluating the heat transfer between macroscopic bodies was proposed some years ago by polder and van hove @xcite .",
    "their theory is based on the general theory of the fluctuating electromagnetic field developed by rytov @xcite and applied by lifshitz @xcite for studying the conservative part , and by volokitin and persson @xcite for studying dissipative part of the van der waals interaction . in the present paper we significantly simplify the formalism of polder and van hove .",
    "we reduce the problem to the finding of the electromagnetic field created by a point dipole outside the bodies .",
    "the formalism of polder and van hove requires the determination of electromagnetic field for all space and for all position of a point dipole , and requires the integration of the product of the component of the electric and magnetic field over the volumes of two bodies .",
    "our formalism requires only the evaluation of a surface integral over one of the bodies and is simplified further in the non - retarded limit ( small distances between bodies ) , where the calculation of the heat transfer is reduced to the problem of finding the electrostatic potential due to a point charge .",
    "we apply the formalism to the calculation of the heat transfer between : ( a ) two semi - infinite bodies , ( b ) a semi - infinite body and a spherical particle , and ( c ) two spherical particles .",
    "problem ( a ) was considered by polder and van hove , but our derivation is much simpler . the problem ( b ) was recently studied by pendry @xcite .",
    "however he only considered large separation and neglected retardation effects .",
    "however for large separations retardation effects becomes very important .",
    "following polder and van hove @xcite , to calculate the fluctuating electromagnetic field we use the general theory of rytov ( see ref .",
    "this method is based on the introduction of a fluctuating current density in the maxwell equations ( just as , for example , the introduction a `` random '' force in the theory of brownian motion of a particle ) . for a monochromatic field ( time factor @xmath9 ) in a dielectric , nonmagnetic medium ,",
    "these equations are : @xmath10 where , following to rytov , we have introduced a fluctuating current density @xmath11 associated with thermal and quantum fluctuations .",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 and@xmath14 @xmath15 are the electric and the electric displacement field , the magnetic and the magnetic induction fields , respectively . for nonmagnetic medium @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the dielectric constant of the surrounded media . accordingly to rytov the average value of the product of components of @xmath11 for local optic case is given by formula @xmath19 and for nonlocal local optic @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a non - local dielectric constant . for simplicity ,",
    "in the derivation we will assume local optics .",
    "however , the same derivation is valid also for the non - local optics case , and the final results is the same in the sense that in both cases the problem of the heat transfer between two bodies is reduced to the problem of finding the electromagnetic field outside the bodies . compared to polder and van hove , our treatment includes non - local effects , such as the anomalous skin effect .    in order to calculate the radiative energy transfer between the bodies we need the ensemble average of the poyting vector @xmath22 at suitable point @xmath23 . from the maxwell equations it follows that the electric field , produced by random current density @xmath24 , is given by @xmath25 where function @xmath26 obeys the equations @xmath27d_{kj}(\\mathbf{r } , \\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},\\omega ) = ( 4\\pi\\omega\\mathrm{i } /c^2)\\delta_{ij}\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime } )    \\label{six}\\ ] ] @xmath28d_{ik}(\\mathbf{r } , \\mathbf{r}^{\\prime},\\omega ) = ( 4\\pi\\omega\\mathrm{i } /c^2)\\delta_{ij}\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime } )    \\label{seven}\\ ] ]    the functions @xmath26 have the following symmetry properties @xcite @xmath29 the poyting vector can be expressed trough the average products of the components of electric field . using equations ( [ six],[seven ] ) we get @xmath30   d_{jk}^{*}(\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime } , \\mathbf{r}^{\\prime \\prime } )    \\nonumber \\\\   - \\left [ \\left ( \\nabla_k^{\\prime \\prime } \\nabla_l^{\\prime\\prime}-\\delta_{lk }",
