    "cryogenic devices are widely used in a broad range of applications like radiation detection , quantum cryptography , charge manipulation on the single - electron level , quantum hall effect or in basic studies of mesoscopic transport .",
    "measurement of the electronic properties of such devices usually requires sophisticated readout electronics .",

    ", the risk of noise pickup on the lines is intrinsically increased .",
    "alternatively , signal readout relatively close to the sample can be accomplished with ` superconducting quantum interference device ' ( squid ) amplifiers , which perform very successfully in many cases but require a delicate setup ( shielding ) and are usually constrained to commercially available systems . amplification or impedance transformation on - chip or very close to the sample is also possible with a ` high electron - mobility transistor ' ( hemt ) , the dissipation of which may , however , quickly reach an unacceptable level .    in recent years",
    "it has been realized that probing the electronic transport in a cryogenic device with a radio - frequency ( rf ) signal may have considerable advantages compared to direct signal readout , mainly due to a substantial extension of the bandwidth . in those schemes",
    "the power of the reflected ( or transmitted ) rf signal from a properly tuned tank circuit is related to the electronic state of the device under test .",
    "the circuit needs to be carefully designed to minimize back - action on the cryogenic sample .",
    "operation at microwave frequencies also naturally opens a potential way for frequency - domain multiplexing.@xcite    a promising readout scheme , which we present in this paper , consists of an on - chip analog - to - frequency converter , delivering a frequency signal of large amplitude which is easily demodulated with standard room temperature ( phase - locked loop ) electronics .",
    "it has the advantages of both the direct signal readout close to the sample and a large frequency bandwidth .",
    "particularly , it is much easier to accurately analyze a frequency signal than to transmit a low - level analog signal through long readout lines and amplify it with room temperature equipment which typically shows inferior performance in terms of noise with increasing temperature .",
    "our low - noise converter circuit is based on a hysteretic josephson junction exhibiting relaxation oscillations .",
    "related ideas using relaxation oscillations in josephson junction were proposed for thermometry@xcite or direct radiation detection,@xcite both relying on the temperature dependence of quasiparticle population in the gap singularity peak of asymmetric junctions , and for the ( double ) relaxation oscillation squid,@xcite which is investigated and used as a magnetometer . in our case",
