    "the extension of quantum information theory to relativistic settings has been a thriving area of research for some time @xcite .",
    "the effects of relativistic motion on entanglement and quantum information protocols have been studied extensively for inertial observers @xcite , as well as for accelerated systems @xcite . however , while the effects on entanglement have been analyzed in detail for both cases , the implications for tests of non - locality via the violation of bell inequalities have received treatment only for the case of inertial motion @xcite . in the other situation ,",
    "i.e. , if ( at least ) one of the observers sharing a bipartite entangled state is moving with uniform acceleration , two scenarios naturally arise .",
    "the common quantum state can be entangled with respect to bosonic or , on the other hand , fermionic modes .",
    "the entanglement degradation of such a two mode state by accelerated motion , commonly attributed to the thermalization due to the unruh effect @xcite , has been investigated for bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite respectively .",
    "the distinguishing feature of the fermionic from the bosonic case in these results is found to be a non - zero residual entanglement between the ( anti-)fermionic modes in the infinite acceleration limit .",
    "the same result has been obtained for the hawking effect in eternal black holes @xcite . moreover",
    ", the remaining entanglement can not be attributed to bound entanglement , since , even in the cases where bound entanglement can feature in principle , the entanglement persists even when measured by the negativity , a measure which only detects distillable entanglement @xcite .",

    "we find that the quantum correlations remaining in the infinite acceleration limit can not be used by the observers to demonstrate quantum non - locality , showing that acceleration effectively degrades correlations even in the fermionic case .",
    "we employ a scheme of two observers , alice and ( anti)rob , one of which , alice , is inertial ( we can assume without loss of generality that alice is at rest ) , while the other one , ( anti)rob , is uniformly accelerated , in complete analogy to the setup used in ref .",

    "any such theory must satisfy the bound @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are unit vectors in @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is the vector of pauli matrices .",

    "@xcite provides a criterion for the maximally possible violation of ( [ eq : chsh inequality ] ) .",
    "the maximally possible value @xmath74 of the bell - chsh expectation value [ left - hand side of ( [ eq : chsh inequality ] ) ] for a given state @xmath60 is determined by @xmath75 where @xmath76 are the two largest eigenvalues of @xmath77 .",

    "we thus obtain @xmath84 similarly , the maximally possible value of the bell - chsh parameter for the antiparticle sector of alice and rob is @xmath85 while the corresponding results for antirob are obtained by exchanging @xmath53 and @xmath54 in ( [ eq : chsh criterion for alice rob particle ] ) and ( [ eq : chsh criterion for alice rob antiparticle ] ) . for the initial state @xmath48 the results of the particle and antiparticle sectors are simply switched . as can be instantly seen from ( [ eq : chsh criterion for alice rob particle ] ) and ( [ eq : chsh criterion for alice rob antiparticle ] ) , the bound for local realism [ right - hand side of ( [ eq : chsh inequality ] ) ] can not be surpassed in the infinite acceleration limit @xmath65 .     for the states @xmath86 ( blue solid , second from the top ) , @xmath59 ( blue dashed ) , @xmath52 ( red dotted - dashed ) , @xmath56 ( red dashed ) for @xmath64 and @xmath86 ( purple solid , topmost ) for @xmath87 .",
    "no non - locality remains in any of the reduced states in the limit @xmath65.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in fact , for the initial state @xmath47 , the entanglement in the antiparticle sector can not violate ( [ eq : chsh inequality ] ) for any choice of @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and vice versa for the initial state @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , the chsh inequality can only ever be violated in the particle sector of either alice and rob , or alice and antirob , but never at the same time by both , i.e. ,    @xmath91    this can be easily proven , by inserting ( [ eq : chsh criterion for alice rob particle ] ) and its counterpart for antirob into ( [ eq : exclusive nonlocality ] ) . because the left - hand side of ( [ eq : exclusive nonlocality ] ) is strictly positive , we can consider the square of this expression to get @xmath92 .",
    "finally , the absolute values can be parameterized as @xmath93 and @xmath94 , with @xmath95 and we get @xmath96 , which , in turn , implies ( [ eq : exclusive nonlocality ] ) .",
    "again , the analogous inequality holds for the antiparticle sector if the state @xmath48 is considered . + this exclusiveness of non - locality matches the physical requirements to test a bell inequality in the accelerated frame . both observers are required to perform measurements independently of each other and communicate their results . however , in order for ( anti)rob to be able to receive alice s measurement results , she has to send these results to ( anti)rob while still being inside region @xmath10 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "assuming alice needs a finite time for this procedure , it is impossible for her to satisfy this requirement for rob as well as antirob simultaneously . +",
    "another requirement for such a test of local realism is the ability to use different measurement bases .",
    "we assume this to be possible by swapping entanglement to another system , e.g. photons .",
    "this can be thought of as a device which produces photons of horizontal polarization when no fermion is incident , while it rotates the photon polarization by @xmath97 , when a ( anti)fermion interacts with the apparatus .",
    "we have provided an operational explanation for the surviving fermionic entanglement in infinitely accelerated frames , bridging the gap to the bosonic case , where no entanglement remains in this limit .",
    "we have shown that in the fermionic case , the surviving entanglement can not be used to violate the chsh inequality , which is the optimal bell inequality for this situation  @xcite .",
    "therefore , no quantum information tasks using these correlations can outperform states with appropriate classical correlations .",
    "this claim holds if the observers are not allowed to manipulate the final state by local operations or classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "in particular , maximally entangled , nonlocal states could be distilled from the residual entanglement , if several copies of the state were supplied and the observers could freely communicate . however , this communication is severely limited in the infinite acceleration limit , such that any schemes of recurring local operations ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) based on the classically transmitted measurement outcomes are excluded .",
    "+ this is especially important not only for the results in the infinite acceleration limit but also if we identify this limit with a black hole situation where an observer is freely falling and another observer is resting arbitrarily close to the event horizon ( see ref .",
    "alice , when falling into a black hole , can not communicate on a quantum information level with an observer who is resting near the horizon .",
    "+ we have further found that the choice of unruh mode ( i.e. , @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) crucially influences which of the accelerated observers , rob or , can in principle test the non - locality of the initial state . + note added .",
