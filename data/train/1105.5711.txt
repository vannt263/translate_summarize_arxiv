    "the disc inclination is @xmath10 @xcite and the southern part of the disc is closer to us @xcite .",
    "we assume a distance of 13.8 mpc @xcite to ngc 2997 and note that 1 arc - min corresponds to a linear scale of @xmath3 4.0 kpc .",
    "basic data on ngc 2997 are listed in table [ tab1basic ] .",
    "+ the photometric and morphological analysis of this galaxy shows the presence of a normal nucleus surrounded by several hii regions known as ` hotspots ' @xcite .",
    "further investigations in optical @xcite , ultraviolet @xcite and near - infrared @xcite have detected a circumnuclear star - forming ring in ngc 2997 .",
    "the study of such a ring is significant in terms of understanding gas transport to the inner regions of the galaxy and its association with any possible nuclear activity .",
    "ngc 2997 also shows several bright knots of emission along its arms .",
    "these knots are young star clusters with typical masses of @xmath11 m@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this galaxy also hosts two giant hii regions which show supersonic velocity dispersion caused by an intense starburst @xcite .",
    "the galaxy which is part of the hi brightest galaxy catalogue of the southern sky derived from hipass has an hi mass of @xmath13 m@xmath12 and half power line width of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "+ ngc 2997 has been extensively studied in radio wavelengths shorter than @xmath15 cm by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this galaxy has not been studied at longer wavelengths ( @xmath16 cm ) .",
    "since the non - thermal spectrum of synchrotron radiation is dominant at low frequencies , the gmrt observations at metre - wavelengths with high angular resolution and high sensitivity can reveal many significant features of ngc 2997 due to its moderate inclination such as smooth synchrotron emission from the disc , morphological structure of spiral arms , nucleus and compact hii regions .",
    "the spectral index distribution study of ngc 2997 could be useful for identification of giant hii regions .",
    "+ the low radio frequency spectrum of the galaxy is important in obtaining the non - thermal spectral index of the galaxy which can then be used to separate the thermal and non - thermal contributions to the observed spectrum .",
    "moreover , the non - thermal luminosities at low frequencies can be used to estimate the supernovae rate ( @xmath17 ) , average star formation rate ( @xmath18 ) , production rate of the lyman continuum photons ( @xmath19 ) etc for the galaxy .",
    "+ in this paper , we present radio continuum observation of ngc 2997 using the gmrt @xcite at 332 , 616 and 1272 @xmath0 .",

    "the last section summarizes the paper .",
    ".basic data on ngc 2997@xmath20 [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     we detect a strong nuclear source in ngc 2997 at all the wavebands which is resolved into a circumnuclear starforming ring in our high resolution 1272 mhz image .",
    "ngc 2997 is an intermediate type sab(rs)c galaxy with several hotspots .",
    "the circumnuclear star forming ring has been observed in the optical and nir @xcite .",
    "circumnuclear rings are observed in 20 per cent of all spiral galaxies and mostly occur in barred galaxies @xcite .",
    "observational studies @xcite show that the circumnuclear ring can arise due to the bar driven radial inflow of magnetized gas materials which gets accumulated in a ring near the location of inner lindbland resonances .",
    "there are two models which explain the star formation in circumnuclear rings : ( i ) in the gravitational instability or  popcorn \" @xcite model , star formation is driven by stochastic gravitational fragmentation along the ring where the star forming regions have a regularly spaced distribution @xcite .",
    "( ii ) in the  pearls on a string \" model , the gas along the bar that flows into the ring is compressed near the contact points .",
    "star formation is then triggered in these over density contact regions .",
    "observationally an age gradient in the star forming regions is seen along either half of the ring @xcite .",
    "+ we made a high resolution image at 1.27 @xmath21 using robust weighting of @xmath22 in the task imagr .",
    "the resulting angular resolution of 3 arcsec ( @xmath3 200 pc ) resolved the circumnuclear ring ( see fig.[circumn2997fig ] ) into five star - forming clumps i.e. hotspots .",
    "we measured the position , peak intensity and integrated flux - density of each hotspot by fitting a gaussian using the task jmfit in aips . the position for each component",
    "is listed using seconds of ra and arcsec of dec in table [ circumn2997tab ] .",
    "the observed luminosity for the individual hotspot is between 0.16 to 1.58 @xmath23 at @xmath15 cm band with a @xmath24 pc resolution .",
    "we also calibrated and imaged vla archival data of this galaxy at 4.8 @xmath21 . the resulting image shown as grey scale in fig.[circumn2997fig ] ( left )",

    "fig.[circumn2997fig ] ( right ) shows the 1.27 @xmath21 radio contour map overlaid on _ hst _ _ v _ band gray - scale image @xcite .",
    "the radio ring is coincident but more extensive than the observed structure of the ring in the _ v _ band .",
    "this is likely to be due to the lower angular resolution at radio wavelengths and partly probably due to extinction at optical wavelengths which @xcite estimate to be about 3 magnitudes in the vicinity of the ring .",
    "the morphological structure of the circumnuclear region in our 1.27 @xmath21 radio contour map is similar to the contour maps of relative intensities in _ u _ band published by @xcite using the saao 1.9-m reflector .",
    "+ our radio contour map and the gray - scale images in the _ uv _ ( @xmath25 ) and radio ( 4.8 @xmath21 ) band shown in fig.[circumn2997fig ] indicate that there is no detectable radio continuum emission from the central part of the nucleus , confirming that there is no radio - loud agn in the center of this galaxy .",
    "@xcite observed circumnuclear rings in five barred or weakly barred spiral galaxies of type sc ( including ngc 2997 ) and none of the rings hosted an agn at its centre . the quiescent phase of the nucleus was also noted in the detailed study of the ngc 2997 nucleus by @xcite .",
    "a large number of hotspots are observed on a complete circumnuclear ring of ngc 2997 at nir @xcite whereas only three northern star - forming regions are visible in the _ v _ band image .",
    "we note that the intense nir hotspots located in the northern part of the ring correlate with the radio hotspots .",
    "weak radio emission is detected from the southern parts of the ring although hotspots are not distinguishable .",
    "the faint emission along the southern half of the ring is seen in _ uv _",
    "@xcite , _ u _ @xcite band image .",
    "faint southern hotspots are also seen in nir ring which @xcite attribute to the heavy dust extinction since the southern hotspots are being observed through the dust lanes . a slight offset between the optical and radio positions of the hotspots are observed .",
    "this could be attributed to the poor angular resolution of the radio data ( @xmath26 arcsec ) as compared to the excellent resolution of the optical data ( @xmath27 arcsec ) and dust extinction near the star forming peaks .",
    "+ the circumnuclear ring that we detect in radio has a deconvolved diameter of @xmath28 arcsec i.e. @xmath8 pc .",
    "the separation between the hotspots ranges from @xmath29 to @xmath30 pc .",
    "this is comparable to the nir where the diameter of the ring is @xmath31 pc ( @xmath328.7 arcsec ) and the spacings between hotspots is @xmath33 pc @xcite .",
    "this is typical of the circumnuclear rings detected in other galaxies .",
    "the average size of the nucleus from the photometric and morphological analysis of the galaxies with peculiar nuclei is quoted to be less than @xmath34 pc @xcite .",
    "+ we compared the circumnuclear ring ( cnr ) in ngc 2997 to the well studied cnr in ngc 1097 @xcite .",
    "the cnr of ngc 1097 has @xmath35 kpc diameter @xcite and a liner / seyfert 1 agn at its centre .",
    "three prominent radio hotspots are seen at @xmath36 cm in ngc 1097 @xcite whereas four bright and one faint hotspots are observed in ngc 2997 at @xmath15 cm ( see fig.[circumn2997fig ] ) .",
    "no azimuthal age gradient is seen in massive stars of both the rings with ages less than @xmath37 to @xmath38 yrs @xcite and both rings show regular distribution of hotspots @xcite which lends support to the gravitational instability model @xcite for the star formation in the cnr .",
    "the cnr in ngc 1097 is formed due to the gas driven by bar potential .",
    "various observational studies show that ngc 2997 does not possess either a prominent large scale bar or an active nucleus @xcite , hence unlike ngc 1097 gas accumulation in the cnr of ngc 2997 is unclear . however , fast magnetohydrodynamic density waves ( fmdws ) at the modified inner lindbland resonance ( milr ) model @xcite can explain the formation of cnr in ngc 2997 . + we estimate an equipartition field in the central nuclear region of diameter @xmath39 pc to be about @xmath9 g .",
    "this is similar to the field strength of @xmath40 g estimated by @xcite for the central region of ngc 2997 and @xmath41 g estimated for the cnr in ngc 1097 by @xcite . the equipartion field for the radio hotspots in ngc 2997 ranges from @xmath42 to @xmath43 g .",
