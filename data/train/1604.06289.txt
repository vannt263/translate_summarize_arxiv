    "the solar chromosphere is a layer above the visible solar surface spanning over approximately a thousand kilometers in height .",
    "it plays an important role in understanding the interaction between the relatively cool photospheric plasma and the hot multi - million degree corona .",
    "small scale magnetic flux concentrations at the boundaries of supergranular cells extend upwards into the chromosphere .",
    "these flux tubes expand into funnel - like structures with height due to a decrease in the ambient gas pressure .",
    "some field lines locally connect within the photosphere and produce a canopy - like structure in the chromosphere and some of them reach to corona .",
    "the chromosphere is still a poorly - understood layer where flows , waves and shocks manifest in the presence of magnetic fields to form an often nonlinear magneto - hydrodynamic system .",
    "waves in the solar atmosphere are studied with great interest as they carry mechanical energy and also provide insight of the physical parameters through seismology @xcite .",
    "oscillations are observed ubiquitously throughout the solar atmosphere and are often interpreted in terms of various magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) modes . acoustic waves ( p - modes ) which are generated inside the sun , are generally trapped inside it .",
    "these waves can freely propagate from the surface into the atmosphere if they have periods shorter than 3.2 minutes ( 5.2 mhz ) which is known as the acoustic cut - off period .",
    "the longer periods generally do not propagate to greater heights and are , instead , evanescent .",
    "there is substantial observational evidence for the presence of long period oscillations in the chromosphere around network magnetic elements .",
    "it appears that the presence of strong network magnetic field changes the scenario @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite argue that strong magnetic fields change the radiative relaxation time , which can increase the cut - off period significantly .",
    "there are also suggestions that the field inclination plays a very important role in long - period wave propagation .",
    "@xcite show that the field inclination is much more important for long - period wave propagation than the radiative relaxation time effect .",
    "highly inclined magnetic fields significantly increase the cut - off period and create magneto - acoustic portals @xcite for the propagation of long - period waves in the chromosphere .",
    "this is commonly referred to as leakage of photospheric oscillations into the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "the  leakage \" of long - period photospheric oscillations takes place through magnetic network elements through restricted areas .",
    "recent studies show that a good fraction of power is present above the cut - off period at higher layers around the quiet magnetic network elements .",
    "two - dimensional power maps of period bands around 3 minutes , reveal two distinct phenomena above network and around elements .",
    "one is known as  power halos  , which are upper - photospheric regions where the wave power is enhanced .",
    "the other is  magnetic shadows ",
    ", which refers to the regions of the power suppression around network elements in the chromosphere .",
    "many researchers have suggested that the interaction between the acoustic waves and the magnetic fields is responsible for the formation of magnetic shadows and power halos .",
    "it was proposed that the upward propagating acoustic waves change their nature at the magnetic canopy , a layer where the gas pressure becomes equal to the magnetic pressure , and undergo mode conversion and transmission processes @xcite .",
    "simulations show that acoustic waves generally transfer their energy partly to the slow magneto - acoustic waves ( mode transmission ) and partly to the fast magneto - acoustic waves ( mode conversion ) at the canopy . due to high velocity gradients ,",
    "the fast mode undergoes reflection at the canopy and increases the oscillation power at lower heights , creating power halos .",
    "in contrast , the slow mode continues to propagate along the slanted magnetic field lines .",
    "argue that the key parameter in mode conversion mechanism is the attack angle ( the angle between the direction of wave propagation and the magnetic field ) and the period of the acoustic waves .",
    "they show that the transmission is generally favored at small attack angles and long periods , while the conversion dominates when the period is small and the attack angle is large , which causes the power halos and magnetic shadows to form around magnetic network regions .    however , most of the earlier studies that put forward the theory based on magneto acoustic - wave reflection did not consider the effect of transients , nor the evolution of magnetic fields and other factors leading to changes in the visible chromospheric canopy .",
    "earlier observations were also limited by low temporal resolution to study the influence of short - lived transients in detail . with our high spatial and temporal resolution observations taken with the 1-m swedish solar telescope",
    "we revisit the subject and attempt to provide an alternative interpretation for the formation of the magnetic shadow and power halo .",
    "section 2 describes the observations along with data reduction procedures .",
    "section 3 provides results in terms of power distribution at several heights in the chromosphere .",
    "section 4 deals with possible scenarios which can explain our observations and compares with earlier interpretations .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section 5 .",
    "observations of a quiet - sun region were made on 2013 may 3 , from 09:06 ut to 09:35 ut using the crisp imaging spectropolarimeter , at the 1-m swedish solar telescope ( sst ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "images were taken at 7 wavelength positions scanning through the h@xmath0 line , at -0.906  , -0.543  , -0.362  , 0.000  , 0.362  , 0.543  , and + 0.906  from line core corresponding to a velocity range of -41 to + 41 km s@xmath1 .",
    "adaptive optics was employed in the observations with the upgraded 85-electrode system @xcite .",
    "all the data were reconstructed using multi - object multi - frame blind deconvolution ( momfbd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with 51  karhunen - love modes sorted by order of atmospheric significance and @xmath2 pixel subfields . an early version of the pipeline described in was used .",
    "destretching @xcite was used together with auxiliary wide - band objects for consistent co - alignment of different narrow - band passbands , as described in .",
    "spatial sampling is 0@xmath3.058 pixel@xmath1 , and the spatial resolution reaches up to 0@xmath3.16 in h@xmath0 covering a field - of - view ( fov ) of 40@xmath440 mm@xmath5 .",
    "after reconstruction , the cadence of a full spectral scan was 1.34 s. in this work , we also made use of wide - band images obtained with the crisp reference camera .",
    "this camera is behind the h@xmath0 pre - filter but before the double fabry - prot .",
    "the pre - filter has a 1  nm passband centered at the core of the line . the images from this camera",
    "provide the anchor channel for momfbd reconstruction and the reference for all post - reconstruction destretch - based techniques .",
    "the vast majority of the light contributing to the images from this camera come from the photospheric wings of the h@xmath0 line .",
    "the cadence of wide - band was also 1.34 s.    line - of - sight ( los ) magnetograms were produced from the stokes v output of fe 6301   spectral scans ( taken at 16 wavelength positions ) using the centre of gravity ( cog ) method .",
    "these scans were acquired at a cadence of @xmath65 minutes over the same fov .",
    "the same h@xmath0 camera was used for obtaining stokes v data .",
    "hence there were gaps of @xmath627  s at @xmath65 , 11 , 16 and 21 minutes of observation .",
    "we have interpolated these data gaps using a spline function to obtain a regular cadence for time series analysis .",
    "note that the treatment via spline - fitting is smoothly bridging intensity in the time - series whereas rbe / rres and mottles cause strong dips in the intensity .",
    "further details on the observations and data reduction are given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "core maps were produced using doppler compensation .",
    "for this , at first , we increased the line profile sampling by a factor of 10 times more than the original using spline interpolation , then the minimum value of the profile is calculated at each pixel to produce the doppler - compensated h@xmath0 core maps .",
    "this procedure minimizes the effects of strong flows that might shift the position of the line core , and thus best represents the emission coming from the line - forming region ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the los doppler velocity maps were determined by the cog method .",
    "the h@xmath0 line core forms at the chromosphere and the wings form at lower atmospheric heights .",
    "filtergram images taken at different positions of the h@xmath0 line , sample , on average , different atmospheric layers and are shown in figure  [ observation ] .",
    "a time lapsed movie of this figure is also available online .",
    "the movie clearly shows the presence of transients .",
    "we investigate the oscillation properties of the different layers by constructing power - maps .",
    "the construction of the power maps was preceded by the removal of a background trend from each lightcurve to obtain the relative percentage intensity variations ( @xmath7 ) given by @xmath8 , where i is the original intensity and i@xmath9 is the background trend .",
    "the background trend , i@xmath9 , is computed from the original lightcurve over a 600 s running average , which when subtracted from the original time series allows intensity fluctuations shorter than 10 minutes to be more readily identified .",
    "the resultant lightcurves are then subjected to wavelet analysis @xcite and the global wavelet power spectrum is calculated at each pixel .",
    "an example of the computed relative intensity variations and the corresponding wavelet analysis results at a single pixel are shown in figure  [ xt_s6_cut1 ] .",
    "power - maps were constructed for 3 , 5 , and 7 minutes period from the global wavelet power spectrum by averaging the power in a one minute bands around each period .",
    "figure  [ power_map ] displays these maps stacked in ascending order of atmospheric height for each band .",
    "a co - spatial photospheric magnetogram is also shown at the bottom panel for comparison .",
    "figure  [ power_map ] reveals that power is suppressed in rosettes over the network in the 3-minute band at lower chromosphere ( h@xmath100.543 and h@xmath10 0.362 ) and enhanced close to the photosphere ( h@xmath100.906   ) in all the bands .",
    "these phenomena are known as magnetic shadows and power halos , respectively .",
    "we also make period maps to study the spatial distribution of dominant periods in each layer .",
    "the period at maximum power above the 99% significance level is taken as the dominant period at each pixel to construct these maps .",
    "the significance levels are calculated assuming white noise @xcite .",
    "the period distribution maps are shown in figure  [ period_map ] along with the photospheric magnetogram .",
    "as in figure  [ power_map ] and [ period_map ] , only the maps produced from the red wings of h@xmath0 are displayed since the blue - wing maps look very similar .",
    "it is evident from the figure , that in the layers dominated by the photosphere ( wide - band and h@xmath100.906  ) , the well known 5-minute photospheric p - mode oscillation is dominant . at larger heights ( h@xmath100.543 and h@xmath10 0.362 ) , the 3-minute period becomes dominant for most of the field - of - view , with the exception of the neighbourhood of the network magnetic element where the longer ( 5 to 7-minute ) periods become dominant .",
    "the distribution of period ( see figure  [ doppler ]  e ) in the h@xmath0 doppler velocity maps show that the 3-minute oscillations cover a wider extent than that in the corresponding period - maps computed from h@xmath0-core intensity ( see figure  [ period_map ] ) .",
    "this behavior was observed earlier by @xcite . the velocity power - maps at different period bands are also shown in figure  [ doppler ]  ( b - d ) .",
    "it shows enhanced power in the higher period - bands around network and suppressed power at lower period band ( 3-minute ) at the same region .",
    "power / period maps were also generated using fast fourier transform ( fft ) techniques .",
    "no significant differences were found when compared to our wavelet results , and hence to avoid duplication we do not include these figures here .",

    "peaks are found at 9 , 4.5 , and 2.5 minutes in the global wavelet power .",
    "similar analysis performed over this region in the h@xmath0 core shows a peak in power at 5.4  minutes ( figure  [ xt_s3_cut1 ] ) .",
    "figures  [ xt_s6_cut1 ] and [ xt_s3_cut1 ] indicate the presence of quasi periodic fluctuations in intensity .",
    "the fluctuations in h@xmath0 core are probably caused by the longer lifetime of mottles ( 3  15 minutes , @xcite ) .",
    "we emphasize that we placed several slits in this region ( both in the h@xmath0 core and h@xmath10 0.362 scan positions ) and our analysis detects oscillation periods around 3  9 minutes .",
    "however , the nature of the ridges is not , generally , periodic but rather quasi - periodic in nature .",
    "the dark ridges generally show high intensity drops compared to the background , which could be attributed to the outward motion of the mottles .",
    "we also measure the standard deviation of intensity at each pixel and construct normalized percentage standard deviation maps .",
    "the normalized percentage standard deviation ( s ) is estimated at each pixel by following s = @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the standard deviation and average intensity , respectively .",
    "the constructed maps are shown in figure  [ std_map ] for different layers .",
    "it is clear that close to network regions where we observe transients like dark mottles and rbes , the normalized percentage standard deviation is quite high .",
    "a continuous periodic oscillation of 10% amplitude ( with any period ) gives a standard deviation of 7% . in the figure ,",
    "the green contours outline the regions with normalized percentage standard deviation of 10  % or more .              in this subsection",
    "we explore the signatures that will be produced in the power spectrum of a bursty signal .",
    "suppose the observed variations in intensity are due to transient phenomena like rres and mottles .",
    "we find that rres lower the intensity by 5  30  % below the background and have a lifetime of 10 to 120  s. chromospheric mottles live for 3  15 minutes @xcite and cause a decrease in intensity of 1050  % . here , we have generated artificial time series to investigate the affect of non - periodic signals superimposed upon background oscillatory phenomena ( e.g. , as captured in our observation ) .",
    "our main motivation is to compare the oscillation power between the network regions ( where rbes , rres and mottles are present ) and the internetwork regions .",
    "we have considered two different cases : the first case models the effects of transients in the power of photospheric wavelength channels , whereas the second case models the impact of transients in the power obtained from chromospheric channels .",
    "case-1 ( photospheric channels ) : first , we have generated an artificial time series using a sinusoidal signal with a 5 minute period , which we found to be the dominant period in the photosphere ( also it is well known ) .",
    "we found that the averaged normalized percentage standard deviation in the photospheric internetwork regions is @xmath62.25  % ( see figure  [ std_map ] ) . in order to match with the observed normalized percentage standard deviation ,",
    "we have selected the amplitude of the sinusoid periodic signal to be 3.2  % with respect to a constant background ( ignoring all the noise and other high- and low - frequency fluctuations ) .",
    "we then performed wavelet analysis on this artificial signal to compute the global wavelet power spectrum as a reference which is shown in the top panel in the figure  [ wavelet_t1 ] .",
    "this was followed by introducing random fluctuations in the same 5 minute periodic signal .",
    "the repetition and the amplitudes of the random fluctuations were selected such that they can mimic the observed lightcurves ( an example of the observed lightcurve is shown in figure  [ xt_s6_cut1 ] ) .",
    "we find that many of the rres show intensity drops between 10 to 25% compared to the background intensity whereas some of the weak and strong rres have intensity drops less than 5% and more than 30% respectively .",
    "they generally occur repeatedly at the same location ( close to the network ) with an average of 35 times in @xmath628 minutes . keeping in mind the observed distribution of the transients ( rres ) ,",
    "we have produced lightcurves while introducing sudden fluctuations ( gaussian - shaped dips ) with random repetitions ( 15 times ) in the same 5 minute periodic signal .",
    "we generated forty five lightcurves while changing the amplitudes ( 10% , 20% and 30% ) and temporal width ( fwhm of 20 , 40 , 60 and 80  s ) of the gaussian - shaped dips .",
    "we then subjected these modified lightcurves to wavelet analysis for computing the power spectra .",
    "some representative examples ( only for the gaussian dips of intensity amplitudes drops of 20% with 1 , 3 and 4 time repetitions and fwhm of 40 , 60 and 80  s ) are shown in the figure  [ wavelet_t1 ] .",
    "we compare the power of 5 minutes oscillation of the reference periodic - signal ( p_5 m in red ) with the power of the same signal with fluctuations ( p_5 m in black ) .",
    "our analysis shows that the power of the 5 minutes period is enhanced 1.16.8 times due to the presence of rbe - like random fluctuations in intensity and lifetime .",
    "the enhancement in power is dependent on the amplitude , temporal width , repetition and also the temporal location ( phase ) of gaussian dips .",
    "we should point out that we have compared the observed 3-minute power between the regions of enhanced power ( network ) and internetwork regions in h@xmath15 + 0.906 and find the the enhancements in power is around 25 times compared to the internetwork regions .",
    "additionally , we find that the power in the period - band of 29 minutes is enhanced which is similar to the observed power - distribution .",
    "case-2 ( chromospheric channels ) : similarly to the first case , we have generated an artificial timeseries with a periodic sinusoidal signal of period 3 minutes .",
    "here we selected the period of the oscillation to be 3 minutes as the chromospheric internetwork regions ( h@xmath10 0.362 ) are dominated by a 3 minute period .",
    "as before , to compare with the observations , we have selected the amplitude of the sinusoid to be 10% ( we find the average normalized percentage standard deviation is @xmath6 7.4% in the internetwork regions of h@xmath0 + 0.362 layer ) with respect to the background . we find that the intensity drops in h@xmath0 + 0.362   due to presence of mottles is around 1050% .",
    "we have produced twenty seven lightcurves while introducing random fluctuations ( 13 gaussian dips distributed along the whole time - series ) by changing the amplitudes ( 20 , 30 and 40% ) and temporal width ( fwhm of 3 , 5 and 7 minutes ) followed by wavelet analysis to compute the power .",
    "few examples ( for the gaussian dips with amplitude of 30 and 40% only ) are shown in figure  [ wavelet_t2 ] .",
    "we compare the power of 3 minutes oscillation of the pure periodic signal ( p_3 m in red ) with the power of the same signal with fluctuations ( p_3 m in black ) .",
    "our analysis shows that the power of the 3 minute period gets suppressed 26% ( though the observed magnetic shadow region show around 6070% decrease of the power of 3 minutes oscillation compared to internetwork regions ) due to the presence of random fluctuations like mottles .",
    "we also noticed that the power in the period band of 59 minutes is generally enhanced due to this kind of sudden fluctuations .",
    "hence , a sudden drop in intensity with a random distribution in time can lead to significant power at different periods .",
    "one important thing to note here is that the periods mainly depend on the distribution of the intensity drops and they are generally longer than their fwhm .",
    "we should point out that sometimes the power gets enhanced depending on the phase of the gaussian dips with respect to the continuous 3 minute periodic sinusoid .",
    "( b ) : distribution of dominant periods in doppler velocity oscillations .",
    "contours on both plots represent a dominant period level of 4.5 minutes .",
    "the contours are calculated after smoothing the image in panel b.,width=321 ]          the time - averaged doppler velocity provides very important information on the statistical properties of the dynamics .",
    "figure  [ avg_doppler]a shows the time - averaged doppler velocity map of the whole fov .",
    "the overplotted contours outline a region with a dominant periodicity of 4.5  minutes as shown in the period - distribution map ( figure  [ avg_doppler]b ) .",
    "it can be seen that within this region , above the network , the average doppler velocity is blue shifted ( @xmath6 5 km  s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the evolution of a portion of the network region is shown in figure  [ core_dop ] .",
    "the white box marked in the left panel is our region of interest for temporal variations .",
    "the upper panels display the intensity and the bottom panels display the doppler velocity as captured in one - minute intervals .",
    "this figure shows that when dark mottles first start appearing , they are blueshifted but with time the mottles evolve and become bright and redshifted .",
    "it is possible that mottles are nothing but strong material outflows like type i spicules .",
    "they appear similar to type i spicular flows following parabolic paths . the material moves outwards causing a blueshift which turns to redshift when the material falls back on the solar surface .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the interaction between acoustic waves and the magnetic field are responsible to the formation of magnetic shadows and power halos .",
    "it is to be noted that using dutch open telescope h@xmath0 observations with a cadence of 30  s , pointed out that there is a strong possibility that power at longer time periods ( @xmath67 minutes ) may be enhanced as a result of the lifetimes of the mottles .",
    "furthermore , , also highlighted that the observed power enhancements , at both photospheric and chromospheric heights , may be closely related to the temporal dynamics of such transients and their lifetimes . in this paper",
    "we have explored if transients can influence the power distribution at different heights . the high - cadence ( 1.34s ) observations presented here allow us to identify and study the dynamics of transient phenomena in greater detail , which was previously not possible due to lower cadence ( @xmath630  s ) .",
    "the quiet chromosphere is generally dominated by numerous elongated dark structures seen in h@xmath0 .",
    "these include rapidly changing hair - like structures known as mottles and extreme doppler - shifted events such as rbes and rres ( for details see review of @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ observation ] and movie  1 ( available online ) reveal that these structures are associated with the regions of network magnetic - fields which appear at the edges of granular cells @xcite .",
    "it is now generally believed that the dark mottles are the disk counterparts of type i spicules and the rbes are the disk counterparts of type ii spicules @xcite .",
    "the mottles seen in the h@xmath0 line have mean velocities of the order of 20 - 40 km s@xmath1 and lifetimes of 3 - 15 minutes @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the transients like rbes and rres generally exhibit upward motion and rapidly fade away without any signature of downward motion .",
    "they have shorter lifetimes ( 10 - 120 s ) , high apparent velocities ( 50 - 150 km s@xmath1 ) , and smaller widths ( 150 and 700 km ) @xcite .    found that mottles arise at the network boundaries as bursts of material and propagate upward with a velocity around 25 km s@xmath1 .",
    "they also show a tendency to occur several times at the same place with a typical duration of around 5 minutes .",
    "our analysis also indicates that the mottles are jet like features originating in the network region that propagate upward .",
    "figure  [ core_dop ] shows that the footpoints of mottles display strong blue - ward shift when they originate but with time they fade away and small red - shifts are observed that likely correspond to material falling back along the magnetic - canopy structures .",
    "the average blueshift above network ( see figure  [ avg_doppler ] ) indicates that material outflows are present in that region .",
    "these outflows are not as strong as they are in individual time frames ( see figure  [ doppler ] ) , suggesting that outflows are not continuous but rather quasi - periodic in nature .",
    "the normalized percentage standard deviation in the photosphere , where 5 minute p - modes dominate , is low ( around 2.25  % ) but , above the network regions where the rres and mottles are seen , is quite high ( above 10% , see figure  [ std_map ] ) .",
    "higher values of normalized percentage standard deviation can not be explained solely by the presence of linear mhd waves ( observations show that the slow waves generally have an amplitude of less than 5 % @xcite ) .",
    "numerical models show that the dark mottles observed in h@xmath0 are due to material density enhancement .",
    "so , the fluctuations caused by the rise and fall of material in the form of transients may be responsible for the observed high standard deviation .",
    "power halos ( across all period bands ) manifesting in the predominantly photospheric bandpass ( h@xmath100.906   ) can be explained due to the occurrence of doppler - shifted transients like rbes and rres .",
    "the online movies clearly show the presence of these transients , particularly in the neighbourhood of the network field concentrations .",
    "although not strictly periodic , they occur repeatedly ( 3  15 times in 28 minutes ) at the same location and have lifetime of 10  120 s. hence , the lifetime and distribution of doppler - shifted rbes ( see figure  4 of @xcite ) can produce sufficient power enhancement in different periods as shown from artificial lightcurves as demonstrated in figure  [ wavelet_t1 ] that corresponds to `` case-1 '' from subsection  [ art_sig ]    imaging data from a passband centered at 0.7   from the h@xmath0 line core was used to produce the power - maps where quiet - sun `` power halos '' were positively identified .",
    "this is closer to the h@xmath0 line core when compared to the predominantly photospheric bandpass at + 0.9   .",
    "thus , we believe that these previous power - halo detections were more affected by doppler - shifted transients than our observations and simulations , firmly setting doppler - shifted transients as the source of the observed halos in the quiet sun . note that in our wide - band power maps we do not find significant power enhancement at the regions of halos as observed in the h@xmath0 + 0.906  .",
    "this confirms earlier report by who also do not find signature of power enhancements in the photospheric broadband continuum band ( centered at 710 nm ) close to network regions .",
    "there is no reason that power - halos should not be observable in wide - band data as they are photospheric .",
    "there should be no difference between narrow - band observations at purely photospheric wavelengths and wide - band observations with respect to wave detection .",
    "the effective difference we find between the two is impact of the doppler - shifted chromospheric transients .    similarly ,",
    "we believe that power from random transients could affect the light curves and influence the power distribution . more generally , presence of transients can leave a two - dimensional signature visible in power - maps obtained in a similar fashion .",
    "one such example is `` network aureoles '' , a structure similar to the power halos as reported in in the upper photosphere / lower chromosphere .",
    "this effect of transients should be present in the active region power halos as well even though it may be less important by a more stable canopy and stronger wave signal .",
    "the power maps are strongly affected close to the network regions where jets are occurring ubiquitously . in the context of euv",
    "coronal bright points @xcite have demonstrated that the quasi - periodic oscillation in transition regions and corona above a network regions are due to repeated occurrences of jets around the network regions .    similarly to the power halos ,",
    "the magnetic shadow seen closer to the line core ( h@xmath100.543 and h@xmath10 0.362 ) in the 3-minute power band can be affected by the lifetime and distribution of the mottles .",
    "it is generally seen that , close to network regions , power above 5 minutes dominates whereas , in the inter - network regions , the dominant period is 3 minutes . the h@xmath0 core - intensity signal ( see figure  [ period_map ] ) is mostly dominated by @xmath165-minute oscillations over the entire fov , whereas the doppler velocity signal ( see figure  [ doppler ] ) shows a @xmath165 minute dominant - period very close to the network region and 3-minute in the inter - network region .",
    "similar behavior was also found by @xcite .",
    "the reason for this could be that , close to the network center , when the mottles travel upward , we observe blue shifts from material flowing towards the observer , but when these reach the magnetic canopy region , we will not be able to observe any los doppler shifts as the material is flowing horizontally with a quasi - periodicity ( the intensity fluctuations can still be observed ) . rather the 3-minute shocks @xcite , buffeting the canopy from below in the internetwork region , are observed in the doppler signal . hence , the lifetime of mottles wo nt affect the doppler power map .",
    "the high intensity fluctuations produced by the appearance and disappearance of mottles cause more power at longer periods , instead of at 3 minutes .",
    "we should point out that conjectured that the nature of the 7-minute power at the chromospheric heights is not acoustic in nature . using our simplistic model we tried to mimic the chromospheric power distribution and we find that the suppression of power in the 3 minute period band due to sudden fluctuations ( like mottles ) , is only few percent ( 26% ) whereas the same fluctuations can highly influence longer - period ( 59 minutes ) power .",
    "our analysis indicates that the observed long - period oscillation in the h@xmath0 core and close to the network in h@xmath0 + 0.362 and h@xmath0 + 0.543 ( see figure  [ period_map ] ) arises due to longer lifetime of the mottles in the quiet - sun network regions . from our observations we find that the magnetic shadow regions ( network ) show 60 - 70% power reduction compared to the internetwork regions .",
    "so , we conclude that although the power can be affected by the lifetime of the mottles , the power suppression due to mottles may not be significant in the 3-minute .",
    "hence , we conjecture that wave mode conversion may play a key role in forming magnetic shadows in the 3-minute power band .",
    "the slow waves may transfer part of their energy upon reaching the canopy layer and convert to fast magneto - acoustic modes .",
    "due to high velocity gradients",
    "the fast mode generally reflects back and form magnetic shadow @xcite .",
    "in addition to this process , @xcite found that fast - to - alfvn wave mode conversion may play an important role in this process and the the fast wave energy can be converted to transverse alfvn waves along the field lines .",
    "we should also point out that most of the theoretical work on the magnetic portals have not included the non - lte effects which may play an important role in the coupled chromosphere where radiation effects are also important .",
    "we studied the oscillatory behavior of the quiet sun using h@xmath0 observation encompassing network bright points .",
    "the power - maps at different layers display the well known `` magnetic shadow '' and `` power halo '' features .",
    "previously , these phenomena were interpreted in terms of acoustic waves interacting with inclined magnetic fields .",
    "we show that , power - maps in general , can be strongly affected by the lifetimes of these transients .",
    "we propose that transients like rbes , that occur ubiquitously in the solar atmosphere , can have a major effect on the formation of power halos in the quiet sun . for magnetic shadows in the 3 minute band",
    ", the mode conversion seems to be most effective , whereas the power at longer periods is highly influenced by the presence of mottles .",
    "we should point out that the shorter time length of the time series also will have some effect on the power analysis .",
    "a very long time series should ideally be used for such purposes but high quality ground - based observations are rarely available for prolonged periods .",
    "most of the previous low cadence observations and numerical simulations have ignored the effects of small - scale transients while explaining the magnetic portal .",
    "our high cadence observations reveal clear presence of these transients and thus waves and transients may simultaneously be present within these structures and can collectively cause the power enhancements and suppression .",
    "it will be very difficult to isolate and decouple these effects , although the dominant source for the formation of power halos appears to be the transients from our observation .",
    "we hope to quantify the contributions from these two sources in our future work , while studying the phase relation between intensity and velocity at different layers . with high spatial and temporal resolution observations",
    "we find that the quite sun chromosphere is highly dynamic where flows , waves and shocks manifest in presence of magnetic field to form an often non - linear magnetohydrodynamic system and future simulations should include all these effects .",
