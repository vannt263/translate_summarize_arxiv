    "mixtures of colloids and polymers are exciting fluid systems .",
    "this is partly due to their industrial importance , but also to the fundamental physical insights they provide @xcite .",
    "an important mechanism governing the phase behavior of colloid - polymer mixtures is the depletion effect , which leads to an effective attraction between the colloids @xcite where the polymer fugacity may be regarded as the analogue of inverse temperature . in particular , for sufficiently large size ratio @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are respectively the radius of gyration of the polymer and the radius of the colloid , a colloid - polymer mixture exhibits stable fluid - fluid phase separation and a solid crystal phase .",
    "since colloidal particles can be visualized close to single particle resolution using confocal microscopy , exciting real - space investigations of fluid criticality are nowadays possible .",
    "in one such experiment , interface fluctuations were directly visualized @xcite .",
    "the snapshots given in ref .   show that the interface fluctuations become more pronounced upon approach of the critical point , a consequence of the diverging correlation length . in a more recent experiment ,",
    "the critical exponent of the correlation length was extracted from real - space data and shown to be compatible with the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ising exponent @xcite .",
    "this finding is consistent with earlier colloid - polymer experiments @xcite , whose results were interpreted in terms of renormalization of the ising critical exponents @xcite .",
    "compared to the wealth of results on the overall shape of the phase diagram , little theoretical attention has been given to the critical behavior of colloidal dispersions .",
    "while the universality class is not expected to be changed from the ising one , characteristic of simple fluids , the greater flexibility of colloid - colloid interactions with respect to their atomic counterparts may allow the study of several nonuniversal aspects of criticality , which are difficult to bring forth in atomic fluids .",
    "inspired in part by the above mentioned experiments , the present paper aims to describe fluid criticality in colloid - polymer mixtures theoretically .",
    "in particular we focused on fluid - fluid phase separation and on the critical behavior of the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model @xcite via numerical simulation and liquid - state theory . on the simulation side , we considered the fluid - fluid phase diagram both of the ao colloid - polymer mixture , and of the one - component fluid of particles interacting via the two - body ao potential for a number of size ratios .",
    "the critical behavior of the order parameter and of the isothermal compressibility were also determined in the binary mixture by finite - size scaling techniques .    despite its simplicity , extracting the critical behavior of the ao model by theoretical means is challenging .",
    "characteristic of the mean - field approximation used till now is the parabolic shape of the binodal , corresponding to @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the critical exponent of the order parameter . since the ao model belongs to the 3d ising universality class @xcite , where @xmath5 @xcite , the true binodal is flatter .",
    "in addition , mean - field approximations appreciably underestimate the critical polymer fugacity , such that the location of the critical point is not reproduced correctly .",
    "in this paper we studied the critical behavior of the ao pair potential by the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) @xcite . among liquid - state theories ,",
    "the hrt has the peculiar feature of implementing the renormalization group machinery , which makes it a reliable tool in the study of the critical behavior of fluids , since it takes into account the effect of long range fluctuations on phase separation in a non - perturbative way .",
    "this theory is indeed capable of getting arbitrarily close to the fluid - fluid critical point .",
    "the present analysis complements an earlier investigation @xcite , where the stress was more on the overall topology of the phase diagram and the stability of fluid - fluid phase separation with respect to freezing . here ,",
    "we devote our attention solely to the fluid critical regime .",
    "notice that we did not make a direct comparison with the experimental results of refs .",
    "@xcite , since the mixture considered there has a polymer - colloid size ratio larger than one .",
    "a one - component treatment where the polymer degrees of freedom are traced out is then untenable in that case .",
    "the main motivations for this paper are the following : first , by comparing the fluid - fluid phase diagram of the ao mixture with that of the one - component ao fluid with the effective pair interaction , we aim at assessing the accuracy of the latter description as the size ratio is varied .",
    "second , we want to compare the critical behavior of the ao mixture as given by finite - size scaling with the results obtained by applying hrt to the ao pair potential .",
    "once reduced quantities are used , so as to make allowance for the discrepancy between the critical polymer densities given by the one- and the two - component descriptions , we find that the hrt is able to reproduce the asymptotic critical power law for the compressibility and the order parameter of the ao mixture with good accuracy .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "iia the main features of the ao model are recalled . in sec .",
    "iib a short overview of the hrt is given .",
    "iii is devoted to the illustration of the simulation techniques : specifically , secs .",
    "iiia and iiib deal with the cumulant intersection and the scaling plots methods for determining the critical temperature and amplitudes respectively . in sec .",
    "iiic the unbiased scaling algorithm mentioned above is described . a biased version of the algorithm , where one assumes that the universality class in known , is described in sec .",
    "iiid . in sec .",
    "iv our hrt and simulation results for several size ratios are presented and discussed and our conclusions are drawn .",
    "in this work we considered a binary mixture of colloidal particles and non - adsorbing polymers . neglecting the degrees of freedom of the individual solvent molecules and of the polymer monomers , it is useful to consider effective potentials between constituents which are pairwise additive . in this context",
    "a very simple and basic model was proposed by asakura and oosawa @xcite ( ao model ) and independently by vrij @xcite .",
    "the colloids are assumed to be hard spheres with radius @xmath6 and the polymers , with radius of gyration @xmath1 , as inter - penetrating and non - interacting as regards to their mutual interactions .",
    "however , the polymers are excluded from the colloids to a certain center - of - mass distance @xmath7 . therefore , with respect to their interaction with colloidal particles the polymer molecules are assumed to behave as hard spheres of radius @xmath8 , the diameter of the colloid - polymer interaction being @xmath9 .",
    "the binary ao model is then represented by a binary mixture characterized by the following potentials : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the distance between two particles .",
    "the above potentials define what we , in this paper , shall call the _ full mixture _ description of the ao model , in which the degrees of freedom of _ both _ the colloids _ and _ the polymers are explicitly retained .",
    "if the polymer degrees of freedom are traced out , the resulting effective ( pair ) interaction reads as : @xmath12 } & { \\sigma_{\\rm c}}<r<{\\sigma_{\\rm c}}+{\\sigma_{\\rm p}}\\\\ 0 & r>{\\sigma_{\\rm c}}+{\\sigma_{\\rm p}}\\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] here @xmath13 is the fugacity of a pure ideal polymer system and @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "[ ao ] we show the interaction potential for several size ratios @xmath15 . on decreasing @xmath15 , the attractive",
    "well potential becomes deeper and narrower .",
    "here we do not intend to describe in detail this model , which is well known in literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and was previously considered also by some of us @xcite .",
    "we just remind that this effective interaction disregards three - body and higher - body terms .",
    "interactions beyond the pair level are actually absent for @xmath16 , but they are present for larger values of @xmath15 , so that @xmath17 becomes less and less accurate as @xmath15 increases . despite of this limit and of its simplicity , we stress that the ao model is able to reproduce also at a fairly quantitative level the main features of the experimental phase diagrams for a large range in the size ratios . finally , we recall that the fluid - fluid demixing becomes stable as @xmath15 increases and the depletion potential becomes longer ranged @xcite .",
    "plots of the effective colloid - colloid pair potential , given by eq.([ao ] ) , as function of the pair separation @xmath11 , for several colloid - to - polymer size ratios @xmath15 . ]",
    "we applied hrt to the two - body ao potential eq.([ao ] ) for different size ratios and we completed the theoretical analysis about the critical behavior of this kind of mixtures preliminarily investigated in ref .",
    "the theoretical results are compared with those we obtained via monte carlo simulation and finite size scaling analysis on the full mixture as well as on the effective pair interaction eq.([ao ] ) .",
    "as introduced before , for the theoretical analysis we consider a model fluid of particles interacting via a pairwise additive potential @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the position of a generic particle @xmath20 .",
    "we assume that the two - body potential @xmath21 is spherically symmetric and results from the sum of a very short - ranged , singular repulsion @xmath22 and a longer - ranged attraction @xmath23 .",
    "in the present case @xmath23 is @xmath24 , i.e. eq.([ao ] ) for @xmath25 .",
    "the fluid interacting via @xmath22 alone acts as the unperturbed or reference system , whose properties are considered as known . here",
    "the reference system is the hard - sphere fluid , whose thermodynamics and correlations are accurately described by the carnahan - starling equation of state  @xcite and the verlet - weis parametrization of the two - body radial distribution function  @xcite .",
    "we then focus on the perturbation @xmath23 . in hrt",
    "@xcite , @xmath23 is switched on by taking its fourier",
    "transform @xmath26 and introducing a parameter @xmath27 and a potential @xmath28 , such that its fourier transform coincides with @xmath26 for @xmath29 , and is identically vanishing for @xmath30 . as @xmath27 evolves from @xmath31 to @xmath32 , the interaction @xmath33 goes from the reference part @xmath22 to the full potential @xmath21 .",
    "this procedure for turning on the interaction closely resembles that adopted in the momentum - space renormalization group  @xcite . at a given stage of the evolution ,",
    "the nature of @xmath28 is such that fluctuations over length scales @xmath34 larger than @xmath35 are suppressed , so that critical fluctuations are recovered only in the limit @xmath36 .",
    "the corresponding evolution of the helmholtz free energy and @xmath37-body direct correlation functions , from the reference fluid to the fully interacting one , is described by an exact hierarchy of integral - differential equations .",
    "close to a critical point and at large length scales , this hierarchy becomes indeed equivalent to a formulation of the momentum - space renormalization group  @xcite .",
    "however , the hrt hierarchy remains valid also away from criticality and over all length scales , thereby describing also the nonuniversal behavior of the fluid , which depends on the specific features of the microscopic interaction .",
    "the first equation of the hierarchy gives the evolution of the helmholtz free energy @xmath38 of the partially interacting system in terms of its two - body direct correlation function in momentum space @xmath39 and the full perturbation @xmath26 : @xmath40 in the equation above , we have set @xmath41 , @xmath42 being the boltzmann constant and @xmath43 the absolute temperature , and the quantities @xmath44 , @xmath45 are linked to @xmath38 and @xmath39 by the relations @xmath46 -\\frac{1}{2 } \\ , \\rho\\!\\int\\!\\!\\frac{d^{3}{\\bf k}}{(2\\pi)^{3 } } \\left[\\phi(k)-\\phi_{q}(k)\\right ] \\label{amod } \\\\ & & { \\cal c}_{q}(k ) = c_{q}(k)+\\phi(k)-\\phi_{q}(k ) \\",
    ", , \\label{cmod}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the volume and @xmath48 the number density .",
    "these modified free energy and direct correlation function have been introduced in order to remove the discontinuities which appear in @xmath38 and @xmath39 at @xmath32 and @xmath49 respectively as a consequence of @xmath50 itself being discontinuous at @xmath49 .",
    "physically they represent the free energy and direct correlation function of the fully interacting fluid as given by a treatment such that the fourier components of the interaction with wavelengths larger than @xmath35 are not really disregarded , but instead they are approximately taken into account by mean - field theory .",
    "in particular , for @xmath32 the modified quantities coincide with the physical ones , once the fluctuations have been fully included , while for @xmath31 they give the mean - field expressions of the free energy and direct correlation function .    in order to get a closed set of equations , eq.([hrteq ] )",
    "has been supplemented with a closure relation for @xmath45 .",
    "this is the point where approximations are introduced into the hrt scheme .",
    "as in previous applications , our form of @xmath45 has been inspired by liquid - state theories , and it reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the direct correlation function of the hard - sphere fluid , and @xmath53 , @xmath54 are _ a priori _ unknown functions of the thermodynamic state and of @xmath27 .",
    "specifically , the function @xmath54 is determined by the core condition , i.e. , the requirement that the radial distribution function @xmath55 be vanishing for every @xmath27 whenever the interparticle separation is less than the hard - sphere diameter @xmath56 .",
    "@xmath53 is adjusted so that @xmath45 satisfies the compressibility rule .",
    "this constraint gives the reduced compressibility of the fluid as the structure factor evaluated at zero wavevector , and can be expressed in terms of the modified quantities @xmath44 , @xmath45 as @xmath57 the compressibility rule  ( [ sum ] ) plays a fundamental role in the present scheme .",
    "in fact , when @xmath53 in eq.([closure ] ) is determined via eq.([sum ] ) and the resulting expression for @xmath45 is used in eq.([hrteq ] ) , one obtains a partial differential equation for @xmath44 which reads @xmath58 \\ , , \\label{hrtclos}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 \\varphi(k ) \\ , .",
    "\\label{psi}\\ ] ] eq.([hrtclos ] ) is integrated numerically from @xmath31 down to @xmath32 . at each integration step , @xmath54 is determined by the core condition @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "this condition acts as an auxiliary equation for determining @xmath64 via eq.([psi ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath54 has been approximated by a fourth - degree polynomial in the interval @xmath63 , and the equations for the coefficients were obtained . in order to keep the computational scheme relatively simple , further approximations were introduced in these auxiliary equations , which amount to decoupling the short- and long - range part of the correlations .",
    "the details of this procedure have been given elsewhere  @xcite .    since in this work",
    "we will be mostly concerned with the critical region , it is worthwhile recalling the critical behavior of hrt with the closure relation  ( [ closure ] )  @xcite . in the critical region and at small @xmath27 , eq.([hrtclos ] ) can be considerably simplified in such a way that it depends just on the long - wavelength limit of the direct correlation function .",
    "this in turn is determined by the compressibility rule  ( [ sum ] ) and the assumption , implicit in eq.([closure ] ) , that @xmath45 is always an analytic function of @xmath65 : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a regular function of @xmath27 , @xmath48 , @xmath43 .",
    "the resulting evolution equation is then cast into universal form by suitably rescaling the density and the free energy .",
    "the critical behavior of the theory is analyzed in terms of fixed - point functions and linearized flow of the rescaled free energy in the neighborhood of the fixed points , along the lines of the renormalization group  @xcite .",
    "the resulting critical exponents are correct to first order in the expansion in the parameter @xmath68 , @xmath69 being the dimensionality of the system .",
    "in particular , the analytic dependence of the direct correlation function on @xmath65 , also known as the ornstein - zernike _ ansatz _ , implies that the critical exponent @xmath70 is zero in our approximation . for @xmath71",
    "one finds  @xcite @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , where the usual notation for the critical exponents has been used .",
    "these exponents satisfy the algebraic relations implied by the scaling of the free energy in the critical region  @xcite . below the critical temperature ,",
    "the theory correctly predicts a diverging compressibility inside the coexistence region .",
    "however , the compressibility diverges also on the coexistence boundary , unlike in the real fluid .",
    "this is a consequence of the ornstein - zernike ansatz  ( [ smallk ] ) .",
    "finally , we observe that , for the ao fluid considered here , the perturbation @xmath77 does not depend on temperature .",
    "the role of the inverse temperature is instead played by the packing fraction of the polymer in the reservoir @xmath78 , defined in terms of the polymer fugacity @xmath13 as @xmath79 ( see eq.([ao ] ) ) . for @xmath78 above a critical value @xmath80",
    ", the ao model will phase separate into a colloid poor phase ( the colloidal vapor , with colloid packing fraction @xmath81 ) and colloid rich phase ( the colloidal liquid , with colloid packing fraction @xmath82 ) . in this sense , then , @xmath78 is the analogue of inverse temperature in fluid - vapor transitions of simple fluids . both the inverse temperature and @xmath78 appear in eq.([hrtclos ] ) just as external parameters which govern the strength of the interaction for an atomic fluid and the ao fluid respectively .",
    "consequently , this does not imply any substantial change in our treatment ( see ref .  ) .",
    "to test the predictions of hrt , large - scale monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the ao model have also been performed , using colloid - to - polymer size ratios @xmath83 ,",
    "@xmath84 and @xmath85 . the simulations were carried out in the grand canonical ensemble . in this ensemble ,",
    "the volume @xmath47 , the colloid fugacity @xmath86 , and the polymer fugacity @xmath13 are fixed , while the number of particles fluctuates .",
    "we use cubic simulation boxes with edge @xmath34 and periodic boundary conditions in all @xmath71 dimensions .",
    "the output of the simulations consists of the distribution @xmath87 , defined as the probability of observing a system containing @xmath88 colloids at `` temperature '' @xmath78 , colloid fugacity @xmath86 and box size @xmath34 .",
    "the simulations of the _ full _ ao model , in which _ both _ the colloids _ and _ the polymers are explicitly retained , were performed using the method of ref .  .",
    "the essential ingredients of this approach are a cluster move @xcite , a reweighting scheme @xcite , and histogram extrapolation @xcite .",
    "in addition , we performed a number of grand canonical simulations using the effective pair potential of eq.([ao ] ) .",
    "these simulations , obviously , do not require the cluster move of ref .  , and were performed using standard grand canonical mc @xcite .    one aim of the simulations is to verify to what degree the critical properties of the ao model predicted by hrt are reproduced .",
    "previous simulations have shown that the ao model belongs to the 3d ising universality class @xcite , and that pronounced deviations from mean - field behavior become visible upon approach of the critical point .",
    "one strong point of hrt lies in its ability to yield non - classical ( i.e.  non mean - field ) critical exponents .",
    "the latter is expected to resemble more closely simulations , and indeed experiments @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we are particularly concerned with the critical behavior of the order parameter and the compressibility in the one - phase region .",
    "more precisely , defining @xmath89 as distance from the critical point , the order parameter @xmath90 is expected to obey @xmath91 , while the ( dimensionless ) compressibility in the one - phase region @xmath92 is expected to diverge as @xmath93 , with critical exponents @xmath4 and @xmath94 , critical amplitudes @xmath95 and @xmath96 , and @xmath97 the volume of a single colloid .",
    "note that this definition of @xmath98 differs from the one adopted in ref .   by a factor @xmath99 .",

    "we first considered the whole coexistence region in order to assess the limits entailed by a description of this mixture in terms of an effective pair interaction as well as by the particular hrt scheme which we used . in ref .",
    "@xcite , some of us showed that hrt yields a very good account of fluid - fluid coexistence curve and of its stability with respect to solid phases for several @xmath15 ( @xmath107 ) .",

    "there are two main features which emerge from the comparison : on the one hand , the agreement between theory and simulation results on the pair interaction is quite good , and increases on increasing the size ratio , because of the theory being tailored , at the present stage , to relatively long - ranged interactions ( the apparent discrepancy in this trend , central panel , is due to the smaller number of mc data close to @xmath108 for @xmath84 than for @xmath85 ) . on the other hand , the agreement between the effective pair interaction description and the full binary mixture increases on decreasing the size ratio , both for the overall coexistence curve and the critical packing fractions @xmath80 and @xmath108 .",

    "the isothermal compressibility , the correlation length @xcite , the order parameter , and the interfacial tension @xcite of the colloid were measured as a function of the polymer concentration , and the critical exponents @xmath94 , @xmath4 , @xmath129 were found to be slightly higher than the asymptotic ising values .",
    "this was explained in terms of exponent renormalization by the factor @xmath131 , @xmath132 being the critical exponent of the specific heath @xcite . on the other hand , exponent renormalization",
    "is not found here , where the quantity driving criticality is the _ reservoir _ density of the polymer , or equivalently its chemical potential .",
    "this is a field analogous to temperature in thermal systems , and does not cause renormalization .",
    "in summary , we have carried out a study of the critical behavior of a simple model of colloid - polymer mixtures by both mc simulations and hrt .",
    "critical fluctuations in colloidal systems are expected to have a strong effect on phase separation , e.g. lowering the free energy barrier for nucleation of the solid in the fluid phase @xcite .",
    "more generally , there exist many examples which show the importance of a full understanding of the universality class of the systems in exam . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", one of us studied the interfacial tension of the ao model , which gives indication of the strength of capillary waves .",
    "the mean - field like behavior and the 3d ising behavior of the capillarity strength are profoundly different ; then it is important to reproduce correctly the universality class of the systems in exam .",
    "the importance of an accurate theoretical approach for this study , where the ability of hrt to describe realistically criticality can be very helpful , origins also from the numerical efforts and time cost necessary to the simulation of a full colloid - polymer mixture .    * acknowledgments * this work is funded in part by the marie curie program of the european union , contract number mrtn - ct2003 - 504712 .",
    "support from the _ deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft _ under the sfb - tr6 ( project sections a5 and d3 ) is also acknowledged .",
    "we thank k. binder and j. horbach for many stimulating discussions ."
