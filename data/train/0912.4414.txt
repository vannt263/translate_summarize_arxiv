    "ordered systems , spinons are proposed to be the elementary spin excitations in spin liquids .",
    "it is believed that spin liquid states can be found in spin @xmath0 antiferromagnets(afms ) on geometric frustrated lattices and several promising candidate materials have been experimentally discovered@xcite . a natural question is whether spin liquid states with fermionic spinons can also exist in @xmath7 systems as is proposed for @xmath0 systems .    to address this issue",
    ", we formulate a fully quantum mechanical fermionic mean field theory for @xmath1 system .",
    "we study the heisenberg afm , and obtain spin - liquid type solutions which have not been proposed previously .",
    "we focus our interest on the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath5 model , which is proposed to be the microscopic hamiltonian for the interesting material @xmath6 , an frustrated afm on triangular lattice .",
    "we argue that a gapless spin liquid state obtained in our mean - field theory is a candidate for the ground state when compared with experimental results .",
    "to begin with , we introduce the fermionic representation for spins . in the @xmath0 case ,",
    "two species of fermionic spinons representing up and down spins are introduced to construct the spin operators .",
    "this fermionic representation can be generalized to arbitrary spin@xcite , in the present paper , we only consider the case @xmath1 .",
    "we introduce @xmath8 species of spinon operators @xmath9 satisfying anti - commutation relations @xmath10 , where @xmath11 .",
    "it is easy to show that spin operators can be expressed in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 s , @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is a @xmath17 matrix whose matrix elements are given by @xmath18 .    in this fermionic spinon representation , a constraint has to be imposed on the hilbert space to ensure that there is only one fermion per site ( particle representation , @xmath19 ) .",
    "alternatively , a spin can equally be represented in a hilbert space with @xmath20 fermions per site ( hole representation , @xmath21 ) .",
    "the two representations are identical for @xmath0 , reflecting a particle - hole symmetry of the hilbert space which is absent for @xmath1 . for @xmath1 the two representations are related by a symmetry group of the spin operators as we shall explain in the following .",
    "following affleck _",
    "et al._@xcite , we introduce the `` hole '' operators @xmath22 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath23 and @xmath24 behave in the same manner under spin rotation and the spin operators can also be written in terms of @xmath23 : @xmath25 . combining @xmath24 and @xmath23 into a @xmath26 matrix @xmath27 @xcite ,",
    "we can reexpress the spin operator as @xmath28 and the constraints can be represented as @xmath29 where @xmath30sign for  particle \" and @xmath31sign for  hole \" representations , respectively .",

    "the constraint is invariant under the @xmath35 group because of particle - hole symmetry mentioned above .",
    "however , for @xmath1 the particle - hole symmetry is absent and the two constraints in eq.([contr2 ] ) are not invariant under the symmetry group .",

    "a physical spin liquid state can be formed by gutzwiller projection of the mean field ground state to the state with single occupancy .    the mean field hamiltonian describes three branches of fermionic spinon excitations with @xmath71 and identical dispersion @xmath72 . for the @xmath51-wave pairing , the excitation is gapless with several dirac cones in the brillouin zone ( the number of cones is given in fig .

    "a more accurate phase diagram can be obtained only when the above plausible states are taken into account and the energies are calculated more accurately from , e.g. , the gutzwiller projected ground state wave function . nevertheless , our calculation shows the possible existence of spin liquid states for spin systems with @xmath7 .",

    "the @xmath51-wave state also predicts linear temperature dependence of spin susceptibility at low temperature .",
