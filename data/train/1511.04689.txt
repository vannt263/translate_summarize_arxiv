    "molecular clouds are a key component of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , as they represent the locations where all star formation takes place . for this reason it is very important to understand how molecular clouds form .",
    "presently , the leading theory is that molecular clouds form from converging flows of lower - density gas , driven either by stellar feedback or by large - scale gravitational instability ( see dobbs , @xcite or klessen & glover @xcite for some recent reviews of the different possible formation mechanisms ) . in this contribution",
    ", we briefly discuss one of the main difficulties involved in observationally distinguishing between these different models , and how we might hope to overcome it .",
    "from a chemical point of view , the main obstacle standing in the way of a given patch of cold atomic gas becoming molecular is the influence of the interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 formation rate per unit volume in the cold neutral medium ( cnm ) can be written approximately as ( hollenbach & mckee @xcite ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the number density of h atoms and @xmath4 is the number density of h nuclei . in the absence of shielding ,",
    "the h@xmath0 photodissociation rate per unit volume is given by ( draine & bertoldi @xcite ) @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the number density of h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "for densities typical of those found in the cnm , @xmath7@xmath8 , the resulting equilibrium ratio of h@xmath0 to h is very small , @xmath9 . as h@xmath0 is a necessary pre -",
    "requisite for co formation , and co photodissociation by the isrf is also highly efficient , the fractional abundance of co in these conditions is also very small .",
    "consequently , the gas can only become molecular once it is capable of shielding itself from the isrf . in the case of h@xmath0 ,",
    "self - shielding dominates when the radiation field is weak , becoming effective once the hydrogen column density exceeds @xmath10 . in the case of co , however , shielding by dust dominates , becoming effective only at @xmath11 .",
    "there is thus a range of column densities for which the gas will be h@xmath0-rich but co - poor .",
    "this co - dark molecular gas has attracted increasing interest in recent years ( see e.g.  wolfire  2010 , langer  2014 ) , particularly since simulations of converging flows have demonstrated that much of the inflowing gas will be co - dark h@xmath0 ( heitsch & hartmann @xcite , clark  @xcite ) .",
    "because of its chemical composition , this gas can not properly be traced using either h@xmath1i or co observations .",
    "however , it may be possible to observe this gas using the [ c@xmath1ii ] @xmath12 m fine structure line .",
    "we explore the feasibility of this in the next section .",
    "column density in each of the indicated velocity channels for one of the molecular clouds formed in the simulation described in section  [ cii ] .",
    "each velocity channel has a width of @xmath13 .",
    "[ h2chan],scaledwidth=92.0% ]      to assess how easily we can trace molecular cloud assembly using [ c@xmath1ii ] emission , we have carried out a simulation of a representative ( 200  pc)@xmath14 volume of the ism using the arepo moving mesh code ( springel @xcite ) .",
    "we inject turbulence on large scales and follow the resulting chemical , thermal and dynamical evolution of the gas using the chemistry and cooling module described in smith  ( @xcite ) .",
    "we assume that the gas is illuminated by a uniform isrf , and have carried out simulations with isrf strengths of @xmath15 and 10 in habing ( @xcite ) units .",
    "the attenuation of the isrf within the dense clouds that form within the simulations is modelled using the treecol algorithm ( clark  @xcite ) .",
    "a number of molecular clouds form in each simulation .",
    "we have selected a subset of these and post - processed them using the radmc-3d radiative transfer code to produce synthetic emission maps of the [ c@xmath1ii ] @xmath12 m line .",
    "we show some example results in figures  [ h2chan ] and [ ciichan ] .",
    "figure  [ h2chan ] shows the h@xmath0 column density through one of the clouds from our @xmath16 simulation , broken up into a series of velocity channels of width @xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ ciichan ] shows the [ c@xmath1ii ] integrated intensity in the same set of velocity channels .",
    "comparison of the two figures shows clearly that the [ c@xmath1ii ] line emission traces the full velocity width of the molecular gas , with little contamination from the surrounding atomic gas .",
    "in addition , it is clear that the peak [ c@xmath1ii ] brightness temperatures are typically @xmath1812  k over a large area .",
    "this is important , as this is bright enough to be mapped with high velocity resolution over angular areas of a few square arc - minutes using the _ upgreat _ instrument on board the sofia observatory in a matter of hours ( s.  ragan , priv .",
    "comm . ) , making it plausible to contemplate making such maps of real clouds .",
    "our @xmath15 simulation yields similar results , but in this case the diffuse co - dark h@xmath0 is cooler and the resulting [ c@xmath1ii ] emission is considerably weaker .",
