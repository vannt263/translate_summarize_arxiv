    "first , it is possible that our surfaces may become fibers after dehn filling , and to rule this out requires the computation of an alexander polynomial .",
    "secondly , and more importantly , we require that the boundary components of the non - separating surface in @xmath49 must all project to the same slope in @xmath2 . to arrange this",
    ", we must develop techniques for constructing surfaces , and computing slopes , explicitly . some of these techniques ( those in section 3 ) may be applied to any bundle , but some ( those in section 4 ) exploit special features of the genus 1 mapping class group .",
    "+   + _ a question _ + although some of the methods in this paper apply only to punctured torus bundles , it is conceivable conjecture [ cnj ] can be attacked along broadly similar lines .",
    "a key step would be to answer the following ( presumably difficult ) question : +   + * question : * let @xmath2 be a knot manifold .",
