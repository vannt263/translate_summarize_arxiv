    "over the past 6 years , six cases of fast radio bursts ( frbs ) have been discovered ( lorimer et al .",
    "2007 ; keane et al . 2012 ; thornton et al .",
    "2013 ; see lorimer et al .",
    "2013 for an overview ) .",
    "the origin of this potentially new population of sources is particularly enigmatic given that the frbs are bright ( @xmath6 ) and brief ( @xmath1 ) pulses of @xmath7 radio emission , with a total estimated rate of @xmath8 over the whole sky ( thornton et al .",
    "the frbs were each detected only once over the @xmath9  min duration of radio coverage of each field .",
    "no counterparts have been detected at other wavelengths , but the analysis of the radio data and the discovery of the frbs occurred years after the events .",
    "the frbs exhibit unusually high dispersion measures ( dms ) .",
    "the first frb discovered by lorimer et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed dm@xmath10 ; the second identified by keane et al .",
    "( 2012 ) had dm@xmath11 , and the remaining four frbs were found by thornton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) with dm@xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "these dms exceed the values expected from the column density of interstellar electrons towards known radio sources , such as pulsars , within the milky way , and hence frbs have been inferred to originate from extragalactic sources at cosmological distances . at source redshifts @xmath14 ( or comoving distances of @xmath15 ) , the intergalactic medium , combined with the dm of the sources host galaxies , could account for the excessive dm values .",
    "in addition to the excess dm , two of the frbs ( one in lorimer et al .",
    "2007 , one in thornton et al . 2013 ) show frequency - dependent pulse smearing , indicative of scattering by electrons along the line of sight , at a level much larger than expected by a galactic interstellar medium . the intergalactic medium has been invoked to explain this scattering as well ( e.g. macquart & koay 2013 ) .",
    "a cosmological distance to frbs makes their theoretical interpretation challenging .",
    "let us consider synchrotron emission from an expanding shell , as commonly done for cosmological radio sources .",
    "if the emitting shell , of radius @xmath16 , moves towards the observer with a lorentz factor @xmath17 , then the pulse duration will be @xmath18 .",
    "for the millisecond durations of frbs , this limits @xmath16 to a value @xmath19 for synchrotron emission by a population of relativistic electrons with a characteristic lorentz factor @xmath20 in the shell s rest - frame , the observed frequency @xmath21 , implies ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the magnetic field strength in the shell s rest frame . using this result , the brightness of frbs , @xmath24\\sim 1~{\\rm jy}$ ] , implies that , at a cosmological distance @xmath25 , the ( isotropically - equivalent ) number of radiating electrons @xmath26 is @xmath27 the resulting optical depth for synchrotron self - absorption is then ( waxman & loeb 1999 ) , @xmath28 the emitting shell is thus highly opaque to the low - frequency radiation it produces , which is able to escape only from its skin .",
    "these considerations imply that it is difficult to explain the large brightnesses and short timescales of frbs at cosmological distances with @xmath29 and with beamed synchrotron models that are similar to those used to describe other extragalactic radio sources , such as @xmath20ray burst afterglows ( meszaros 2013 ; piran 2004 ) and active galactic nuclei ( begelman et al . 1980 ) .",
    "exotic processes involving extremely relativistic outflows or coherent radio emission by bunches of electrons ( katz 2013 ) near compact objects , such as magnetars ( popov & postnov 2013 ) , neutron star binaries ( totani 2013 ) , binary white - dwarf mergers ( kashiyama , ioka , & meszaros ( 2013 ) , or supramassive neutron stars ( falcke & rezzolla 2013 ; zhang 2013 ) , must instead be considered .",
    "however , even in these scenarios , regardless of the emission mechanism , it is difficult to see how synchrotron absorption could be avoided , if not in the emitting plasma itself , then in its immediate environment . at cosmological distances , the required source luminosity @xmath30 exceeds the eddington luminosity @xmath31 of a stellar progenitor of mass @xmath32@xmath33 by orders of magnitude , @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the repulsive radiation force dominates over gravity and is likely to produce an electron - rich outflow outside the emission region .",
    "the strong synchrotron absorption of the emitted ghz radiation by the likely surrounding magnetized outflow has not been considered in the above - mentioned models . even for a modest electron column density and magnetic field strength in the outflow , one typically gets a synchrotron absorption optical depth ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) that is much larger than unity at the low observed frequency of @xmath7 .",
    "given that the required number of radiating electrons increases with source distance , it is much easier to satisfy the brightness requirement of frbs by invoking nearby galactic sources .",
    "since frbs were found by surveying regions of the sky with galactic latitudes @xmath35 , a galactic disk source population must be within a distance of several stellar - disk scale heights , i.e. @xmath36 kpc from the sun ( about six orders of magnitude closer than conjectured by the frb discoverers ) .",
    "a halo population may , of course , be somewhat more distant .",
    "the local stellar mass density is @xmath37  pc@xmath38 ( mcmillan 2011 ) , which gives @xmath39 stars within this disk volume , most of them with mass @xmath40 , i.e. k- and m - type dwarfs .",
    "some flaring dwarf stars are already known to produce coherent radio bursts with rise times shorter than @xmath41 milliseconds and @xmath2  ghz flux densities of a fraction of a jy ( lang et al .",
    "1983 ; lang & wilson 1986 ; gdel et al .",
    "1989 , bastian et al .",
    "these bursts are thought to be produced by the cyclotron maser mechanism , in which coherent radio emission with @xmath42 occurs due to bunching of the emitting electrons as they gyrate around the magnetic field of the host star ( gdel 2002 ; treumann 2006 ; matthews 2013 ) . if frb eruptions are produced at the bottom of the coronae of their host stars , or cause coronal mass ejections of their own ( drake et al .",
    "2013 ) , the radiation they produce is likely to pass through a plasma blanket with a characteristic electron column density @xmath43 , as needed to explain the observed dms .",
    "the same plasma blanket could also produce the pulse smearing observed in some frbs .",
    "for the characteristic electron density at the base of the corona of a flaring star , @xmath44 , the plasma frequency is @xmath45  ghz , below but comparable to the observed photon frequency in frbs .",
    "the turbulence generated in this plasma during a flare could therefore produce scattering of the radio waves at large angles , and hence the observed , @xmath2  ms , temporal smearing through the associated time delays between different light paths . since , in this scenario , the scattering screen is positioned on top of the source , the distant thin screen approximation used for smearing by an intergalactic screen ( goodman & narayan 1989 ; macquart & koay 2013 ) is not applicable .",
    "however , if the source of an frb flare is a localized reconnection event , then the point source approximation may still apply .",
    "we expect a low frequency cutoff in the emission spectrum of frbs .",
    "its detection would allow measuring the plasma frequency , and hence density , of the stellar coronae in which frbs are produced .",
    "stellar magnetic flaring activity is often seen in two circumstances  in young , low - mass , stars , and in solar - mass contact binaries . in either case , the source stars can be identified by means of their optical variability , whether flaring , periodic , or quasi - periodic .",
    "walkowicz et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have used data from the _ kepler _ mission to characterise the statistics of flaring activity in low - mass stars .",
    "they find that the large majority of flaring stars are m - type stars . furthermore , flaring activity is confined to m stars only within a height of @xmath46  pc above the galactic plane , and at @xmath47  pc almost 50% of m stars flare .",
    "this height dependence arises because only young m stars are magnetically active .",
    "once such stars age , they are dynamically scattered to the larger scale height of the stellar disk . thus ,",
    "if frb sources are flaring m stars , they will be within @xmath48  pc .",
    "the active m stars from _ kepler _ generally also show quasi - periodic `` quiescent variability '' , due to coverage of their surfaces by spots , with peak - to - peak amplitudes of order a few percent ( basri et al .",
    "thus , such stars may be identifiable by means of their optical variability .",
    "the second class of common stars with flaring activity are binaries of the w ursa majoris ( w uma ) type , consisting of two stars , usually f to k - type , in contact within a common envelope .",
    "such systems show periodic optical photometric variability , with @xmath49  hr periods , due to the combination of mutual eclipses by the components , and their ellipsoidal tidal distortion ( e.g. , rucinski 1997 ; molnar , van noord , & steenwyk 2013 ) .    as a test of our local frb - source hypothesis , we have therefore monitored in the optical the fields of three of the six known frbs , in search of unusual optical variables .",
    "we observed the fields of three of the known frbs using the wise observatory 1-m telescope in mitspe ramon , israel .",
    "the targets , dates ( ut at beginning of night ) , and mode of observation , are listed in table  [ table : obsjournal ] . for imaging",
    ", we used laiwo , an 8k@xmath508k ccd mosaic that covers a non - contiguous @xmath51 field of view at the cassegrain focus of the telescope .",
    "johnson @xmath52 and @xmath53 filters were used on some nights , and only the @xmath52 band on others .",
    "exposure times varied from night to night , from 1 to 10  min per exposure . on ut august 2 , 2013 , observations of landolt ( 1992 ) photometric standard fields were interspersed during the night with the frb fields . a photometric solution for these data using the meastan routine written by one of us ( d.m . ) in iraf was used to calibrate photometrically the stars in each field to 0.03  mag accuracy .",
    ".journal of observations [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the period , amplitude , light - curve shape , low level of colour variability , and spectrum , are all suggestive of a typical w uma system , consisting of two g - type stars in a contact binary . from the 0.22  mag amplitude and the similar depths of the two minima",
    ", the system s orbital pole has a low inclination to our line of sight ( as opposed to edge - on systems , where mutual eclipses of the two components result in amplitudes of factor @xmath54 , and differing depths of the two minima ) . scaling the _ rosat _ x - ray count rates of about @xmath55 , seen in nearby w uma systems ( mcgale , pye , & hodgekin 1996 ) , by the optical magnitude differences , a count rate of only @xmath56  s@xmath57 x - ray photons would be expected in v233003 - 024818 , consistent with the present non - detection .",
    "the system may , alternatively , be a single , ellipsoidally distorted , g star , in orbit with an unseen lower - mass companion  an m star or a compact stellar remnant .",
    "we exclude the possibility that the periodic variability results from a single pulsating star with half of the above period ( i.e. @xmath58  hr ) because : _ ( i ) _ main - sequence g stars do not pulsate with such periods and amplitudes ; _ ( ii ) _ pulsating stars change colour over a period , as their radii and temperatures oscillate . finally , it is possible , but seems unlikely , that this is a single g star rotating near breakup speed , with a pattern of spots that is stable over at least several months , and that the spots somehow produce the smooth lightcurve observed .    we conclude that v233003 - 024818 is very likely a w uma system . assuming that , at maximum , we are seeing the luminosities of two main - sequence g2 stars , the distance to the system is about 800  pc . for its galactic latitude of @xmath59 ,",
    "this corresponds to a height @xmath60  pc above the galactic plane , 1.5 times the disk scale height of w uma systems ( rucinski 1997 ) .      in this frb field",
    ", we have found no conspicuous variables . at magnitudes fainter than @xmath61 ,",
    "variables are seen above the _ rms _ noise locus in the _ rms _ versus mean diagram , in this , as in the other fields . however , they occur as frequently within the frb beams as outside them .",
    "while one of them might be a flare star that was the source of the frb , our current data can not identify it as such .",
    "this null - detection field hosted the brightest among the thornton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) frbs , with a 1.3 jy flux density at peak .",
    "we note that the frb beam for this event includes also a 8.8  mag star , hd 213735 , which is saturated in our data , and hence we could not test it for variability .",
    "we are currently monitoring this star with a smaller telescope and short exposures .",
    "as in the frb 110220 field , in this field as well we find no unusual variable stars , other than the common fainter examples .",
    "we have argued that frb sources need not be exotic events at cosmological distances , but rather could be due to extreme magnetic activity in nearby galactic stars . to test this hypothesis ,",
    "we have monitored the stars in the directions of three frbs , in search of unusual optically variable stars that could signal stellar frb sources . in one field , we have found a likely w uma contact binary system at a distance of 800  pc .",
    "the total solid angle of sky that we have monitored outside of the frb beams is 20 times larger than the solid angle inside the beams . in the non - frb - beam region",
    ", we have found only one other bright and periodic variable comparable to v233003 - 024818 ( also in the field of frb 110703 , but outside the radio beam ) .",
    "none of the much fainter variables that we have found are periodic .",
    "this suggests a @xmath62 probability for the chance coincidence of v233003 - 024818 within one of the frb beams .",
    "a similar estimate of this probability comes from considering the frequency of w uma systems among solar - like stars .",
    "rucinski ( 1997 ) estimates a solar - neighborhood space density of w uma systems of @xmath63 . assuming a g - star space density of @xmath64 , about one in 200 g - stars is in a w uma system . within the three frb beams that we have monitored ,",
    "there are 12 stars brighter than 14 mag and with @xmath65 , similar to late f to early g stars .",
    "this again suggests a @xmath62 chance probability for a w uma system within one of the frb beams .",
    "interestingly , w uma systems likely have the right coronal properties necessary to explain the dms of the observed frbs , in the range of 400 - 1100 cm@xmath38  pc . for example , gondoin ( 2004 ) has observed and analysed the spectral evolution of one of the frequent x - ray flaring events in vw cephei , a well - studied w uma system .",
    "the deduced electron density , @xmath67  cm@xmath38 , combined with a flare loop length of @xmath68  cm , comparable to the size of the flaring primary star , gives an electron column density of @xmath69  @xmath70  cm@xmath38  pc .",
    "the x - ray temperatures are sufficient to propel the gas beyond the escape speed from the star , @xmath71  km  s@xmath57 .",
    "the frequent ejection of material with such column densities and scale lengths implies a mass loss of order @xmath72 over the 1  gyr estimated lifetime of the contact phase ( eker , demircan , & bilir 2008 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the mass losses inferred by yildiz & dogan ( 2013 ) who compare evolutionary models of w uma binaries to known systems .",
    "we have found no unusually variable stars in the two other frb fields that we have observed .",
    "our results present several possibilities .",
    "first , the presence of the periodic variable in one frb beam area could be , after all , a chance coincidence .",
    "there is an element of _ a posteriori _ statistics in our analysis , since we set out on a `` fishing expedition '' for unusual optical variables , without defining in advance exactly what types of objects or properties would constitute such variables .",
    "the true frb sources could therefore be some other stars in the fields that we have not noted ( perhaps from among the fainter variable stars seen in the fields ) , or the sources could be extragalactic after all , as postulated in previous papers . alternatively ,",
    "if the w uma system really is the frb 110703 source , this would raise the question of why a w uma system is not seen in the other two frb beams as well .",
    "perhaps diverse stellar systems and processes can lead to an frb , unless , e.g. , there are w uma systems in all three frb beams , but in two cases they are undetected as such because their orbits are oriented nearly pole - on to our line of sight .    if w uma systems are indeed the sources of frbs , their known space density allows us to estimate the mean recurrence time of frbs from a given source . within the 800  pc distance to v233003 - 024818 , and assuming a scale height of 450  pc for w uma systems ( rucinski 1997 ) , there are roughly @xmath73 such systems . the frb rate of @xmath74  day@xmath57 estimated by thornton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) then implies that an frb will recur at the same position about once every two weeks , on average .",
    "this prediction can be tested by continuous longterm radio monitoring of frb sites .",
    "this will soon be possible with wide - field radio surveys such as the murchison widefield array ( trott , tingay , & wayth 2013 ) .",
    "the degree of isotropy of frb events is yet unclear .",
    "the four thornton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) frbs were discovered by searching 24% of a high - galactic - latitude survey region , @xmath75 .",
    "thornton et al .",
    "( 2013 ) also report that no frbs were found in a mid - latitude , @xmath76 , region .",
    "assuming an isotropic distribution , based on the high - latitude numbers , @xmath77 frbs were expected , under ideal conditions , in the full mid - latitude survey . since only 23% of the mid - latitude data have been analyzed , the expectation value at mid - latitudes is 1.6 frbs . and",
    "since the `` milky way foreground would reduce this rate , with increased sky temperature , scattering , and dispersion , for surveys close to the galactic plane '' , the expectation value at @xmath76 is likely @xmath36 , and the lack of detections there , at this stage , is not surprising .",
    "if frbs originate from a galactic disk population , more than one scale height away ( where the scale - height is 450  pc for w uma systems or 100  pc for active young m stars ) , then future frb detections should gradually show a preference for the galactic plane , with a cumulative number above photon flux @xmath78 that scales as @xmath79 , due to the two - dimensional geometry of the disk convolved with the intrinsic flux distribution per source",
    ". for closer galactic sources , less than a scale - height away , there should be little difference in isotropy compared to a scenario involving cosmological distances .",
