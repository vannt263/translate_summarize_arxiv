    "a fascinating example of the richness of bilayer 2des quantum phenomena occurs when the total density @xmath8 of electrons in the bilayer equals the degeneracy @xmath9 of a single spin - resolved landau level created by a magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "in this situation the total landau level filling factor is @xmath11 .",
    "if the spacing between the two layers is small , the 2des is a gapped quantum hall ( qh ) liquid well described by halperin s @xmath12 wavefunction @xcite and may be described in several equivalent ways , including as a bose - einstein condensate of interlayer excitons@xcite or a pseudospin ferromagnet @xcite .",
    "this collective state exists even in the absence of interlayer tunneling@xcite and possesses an unusual broken symmetry , spontaneous interlayer phase coherence .",
    "this phase coherence is responsible for the very unusual physical properties of the bilayer system at small layer separation , including josephson - like interlayer tunneling@xcite and vanishing hall and longitudinal resistances@xcite when currents are driven in opposition ( counterflow ) in the two layers . for layer spacings larger than a critical value ,",
    "interlayer phase coherence is lost and the system properties revert to those characteristic of independent layers .",
    "interlayer tunneling is heavily suppressed at zero bias@xcite , no anomalous counterflow transport properties are observed and , for density balanced layers ( i.e. @xmath13 ) , there is no quantized hall effect . for sufficiently large layer separation",
    ", the system may be described as two independent composite fermion ( cf ) metals@xcite .",
    "theory suggests that the transition , as a function of layer separation , between the coherent and incoherent @xmath0  states reflects an underlying zero temperature quantum phase transition .",
    "this is consistent with experiments which show that the dimensionless critical layer separation @xmath14  ( with @xmath15 the center - to - center separation of the quantum wells containing the electron gases and @xmath16 the magnetic length ) extrapolates to a finite value @xmath17 in the @xmath18 limit . at finite temperatures",
    "a kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) vortex unbinding transition is anticipated@xcite to lead to the loss of phase coherence above a critical temperature , @xmath19 .",
    "recently , strong experimental evidence for a true finite temperature transition in density balanced @xmath0  bilayers has emerged@xcite .",
    "although the observed linear temperature dependence of the critical layer separation @xmath14  is roughly consistent with theoretical estimates for the kt transition@xcite , it remains unclear how close the connection is .",
    "spontaneous interlayer phase coherence renders the @xmath0  state at small layer separation insensitive to layer density difference , @xmath20 .",
    "indeed , the halperin @xmath12 wavefunction accurately captures the essential correlations at @xmath0  and small @xmath4  for any combination of densities in the two layers .",
    "experiments have clearly demonstrated the stability the coherent @xmath0  phase against layer density imbalances and have even shown that the critical layer separation @xmath14  is increased by small imbalances@xcite .",
    "the robust character of the coherent @xmath0  phase at small @xmath4  against density imbalance contrasts sharply with the situation at large @xmath4 .",
    "there the bilayer is effectively two independent 2des layers in parallel and density imbalance opens the possibility of numerous qualitatively different phases .",
    "conjugate pairs of both incompressible fqhe states , e.g. @xmath21 = ( 1/3 , 2/3 ) , and compressible states , e.g. @xmath21 = ( 1/4 , 3/4 ) are obvious candidates . but even after specifying the individual filling factors there remain multiple possibilities if the spin polarization of the system is incomplete . for example , at the low magnetic fields typical of bilayer @xmath0  experiments a single layer 2des at @xmath22 is most likely spin unpolarized , even though its conjugate partner at @xmath23 is fully polarized . that spin is a relevant variable in bilayer @xmath0  experiments",
    "has already been clearly demonstrated@xcite .",
    "the above considerations suggest that the phase boundary separating the imbalanced coherent @xmath0  bilayer at small @xmath4  from the numerous possible incoherent states at large @xmath4  is highly intricate .",
    "while disorder within the 2d systems is likely to wash out the finer features of the phase boundary surface , it is reasonable to expect that interesting ones remain .",
    "these features are the subject of this paper .",
    "we report here the results of interlayer tunneling and transport experiments which map out a large portion of the @xmath4  - @xmath5 - @xmath2  phase diagram for bilayers at @xmath0 .",
    "we make five main observations : 1 ) the coherent @xmath0  bilayer state can survive at least up to @xmath2  = 0.5 , i.e. ( @xmath6 , @xmath24 ) = ( 3/4 , 1/4 ) .",
    "2 ) deep inside the coherent phase , at small @xmath4 , the effect of a small @xmath2  is to reduce the amplitude of the coherent tunneling resonance , while close to the phase boundary , at larger @xmath4 , small imbalances increase the strength of tunneling .",
    "3 ) close to the critical @xmath14 the coherent @xmath0  phase can be absent at @xmath2  = 0 , present over an intermediate range of imbalance , and then destroyed again at larger @xmath2 .",
    "4 ) while the critical layer spacing @xmath14 of density balanced @xmath0  bilayers falls linearly with temperature@xcite , at @xmath2  = 1/3 we find a much weaker temperature dependence .",
    "5 ) at @xmath2  = 1/3 we find clear evidence that as @xmath4  increases the system makes a rapid transition from an incompressible , interlayer phase coherent state to another incompressible , but at most weakly interlayer coupled state consisting of quasi - independent fractional quantized hall effect ( fqhe ) states at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    the paper is organized as follows : section ii discusses experimental issues , focusing in particular on the challenges encountered in accurately determining the densities of the individual layers in imbalanced bilayers and in making reliable tunneling measurements in systems with low sheet conductivities .",

    "each arm is crossed by evaporated metal strip gates on the top and thinned back side of the sample .",
    "these arm gates are used to selectively deplete either the top or bottom 2des in the bilayer , thereby allowing the ohmic contacts to connect to the inner square region via one or the other 2des layer separately .",

    "the mobility of each 2des is reduced accordingly ( in rough proportion to the density ) and this in turn adversely affects the strength of correlated electron phenomena in the sample .",

    "alternatively , the shubnikov - de haas oscillations of the longitudinal resistance @xmath57 at intermediate magnetic fields allow for accurate density measurements . both of these methods become problematic in the quantized hall effect regime where plateaus in @xmath58 and wide zeroes in @xmath57 interfere .",

    "figure 1(a ) shows typical shubnikov - de haas oscillations in the resistivity of the top 2des .",
    "however , owing to the finite compressibility of the individual 2d electron systems@xcite , it can not be assumed that the actions of the top and back - side gates are orthogonal .",
    "instead , it is necessary to independently measure @xmath59 and @xmath60 over an entire grid of gate voltages , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it is worth noting that interlayer tunneling measurements at zero and low magnetic fields provide an accurate check of the density calibrations for the special case of equal layer densities . at @xmath61 the tunneling conductance @xmath36 vs. @xmath37",

    "the situation for imbalanced bilayers at high magnetic field is considerably more complicated .",
    "when the top and back - side gates are used to create a density imbalance between the layers , the calibrations discussed above only remain accurate at low and intermediate magnetic fields . at high fields , in the lowest landau level , many - body effects lead to a redistribution of charge between the layers . in the following",
    "we explain how this effect is observed , understood , and accounted for in the analysis of our experimental results on imbalanced @xmath0  bilayers .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows two hall resistance @xmath58 @xmath65 magnetic field @xmath10 traces for the bottom 2d electron gas in the bilayer at @xmath66 mk .",
    "this high temperature was chosen to suppress all but the strongest integer quantum hall states .",
    "the two traces correspond to two very different gating conditions , but with each designed to produce the same electron density @xmath60 in the bottom 2d layer . for the upper ( black ) trace the top 2d electron gas is @xmath67 depleted , @xmath68 , by applying a top gate voltage of @xmath69 mv .",

    "as expected , at low magnetic fields , @xmath74 t , the two hall traces are essentially identical , demonstrating the near equality of the bottom layer densities in the two cases .    for @xmath75 t ,",
    "corresponding to @xmath76 and the fermi level of the lower layer entering the lowest orbital landau level , the two traces begin to separate . for the upper ( black ) trace , which corresponds to the case where the top 2des is fully depleted",
    ", the slope of the hall resistance at high magnetic fields gives essentially the same density as found at low fields ( @xmath77 @xmath32 ) .",
    "in contrast , in the lower ( red ) trace , for which the top 2des is not fully depleted , the hall slope at high fields is @xmath78 the same as the slope at low fields .",
    "moreover , the hall plateaus at @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the lower trace occur at higher magnetic field than in the upper trace . apparently , the density of the lower 2des layer becomes larger at high magnetic fields when a non - zero density of electrons is present in the top layer .",
    "the dashed line is a linear fit to the lower hall data trace for fields @xmath81 t. this line , which extrapolates back to @xmath82 at @xmath83 , indicates a density of @xmath84 @xmath32 .",
    "this is substantially larger than the density of @xmath77 @xmath32 inferred from the low field data .",
    "hall measurements on the top 2des under comparable gating conditions reveal that its density is @xmath85 as the magnetic field rises above @xmath50 t. our data are consistent , to within experimental error , with the total density @xmath86 remaining constant as the magnetic field is increased even though a significant transfer of charge from one layer to the other takes place .",
    "figure 1(c ) summarizes this density transfer effect for three different total electron densities @xmath8 and thus three different @xmath4  values at @xmath0 . for each @xmath4",
    "there are several data points , each corresponding to a specific combination of top and back - side gate voltages , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , imposed in order to imbalance the bilayer .",
    "the horizontal coordinate of each data point indicates the filling factor imbalance @xmath53 at @xmath0  deduced from low field shubnikov - de haas measurements made under the same gating conditions .",
    "the vertical coordinate represents the density imbalance @xmath52 deduced from the hall slopes observed at high fields and temperatures , again with same gate voltages .",
    "the dashed line indicates where @xmath87 ; the data do not lie along this line , they merely cross it at @xmath2  = 0 .",
    "the imbalance correction is largest at low @xmath4  and large @xmath2 , and measurements have verified that the density changes are equal and opposite in the two layers .    the light solid line in fig .",
    "1(c ) represents a simulation , described in detail in the appendix , of the charge transfer effect .",
    "in essence , the charge transfer is due to the compressibility of the 2d electron systems . owing to their finite compressibility",
    ", the density of the individual 2dess in an imbalanced bilayer system does not match the density of positive charges on the gate and in the doping layer closest to it .",
    "( of course , the sum of the two 2des densities equals the sum of the positive background charge density on both gates and both doping layers . )",
    "if the compressibility is negative@xcite , the net result is that the imbalance in 2des densities exceeds the imbalance in the gate charge density .",
    "the solid line in the figure shows that a crude approximation of the effects of negative compressibility captures the essential physics behind the charge transfer effect we observe experimentally .    in what follows",
    ", we refer only to the imbalance @xmath2  deduced from high field hall effect measurements , and thus always incorporate the charge transfer effect .",
    "we stress that for the data presented here the maximum correction to @xmath2  never exceeds 0.1 and is generally much smaller . indeed , for the majority of the qualitative conclusions we draw , it is immaterial whether the charge transfer effect is included or not",
    ". however , the inclusion of this effect @xmath88 important in predicting the gate voltages that will render @xmath89 = 1/3 and 2/3 in the individual layers . we estimate that our quoted imbalances @xmath2  are accurate to better than @xmath90 near @xmath2  = 0 and @xmath91 at @xmath92 .",
    "the tunneling measurements presented here are two - terminal : a voltage @xmath37 ( consisting of a dc voltage plus a small ( @xmath93v ) ac modulation at 3.3 hz ) is applied between the two layers and the resulting ac current is recorded .",
    "the ratio of the ac current to the applied ac modulation voltage yields the conductance @xmath36 .",
    "this conductance is dominated by interlayer tunneling only when the sheet conductivity of the 2d layers themselves is much larger than the tunneling conductance .",
    "if this condition is not met , then only a fraction of the applied voltage drops across the tunnel barrier ( with the rest dropping within the 2d layers themselves ) and the observed conductance is smaller than the true tunneling conductance@xcite .    at high @xmath4 ,",
    "where the two layers are behaving essentially independently , low sheet conductivity is rarely a problem , at least near zero interlayer voltage .",
    "this is because of the strong suppression of low energy interlayer tunneling at high magnetic field arising from coulomb blockade - like effects@xcite .",
    "in essence , even if a 2des is in a thermodynamically compressible state ( @xmath94 at @xmath95 ) , on the very short time scales characteristic of tunneling the strong @xmath96-layer correlations in the system render it effectively incompressible .",
    "the resulting strong suppression of the tunneling conductance allows for reliable measurements even in the presence of relatively low sheet conductivities@xcite .    at small @xmath4 , in the interlayer coherent @xmath0  phase , a strong and very sharp resonant enhancement of",
    "the tunneling conductance @xmath36 appears around zero interlayer bias@xcite .",
    "this peak is one of the most dramatic signatures of spontaneous interlayer phase coherence at @xmath0 . at the same time ,",

    "2(a ) three @xmath0  tunneling conductance resonances are shown . the total electron density in the bilayer ( @xmath101 @xmath32 ) , magnetic field ( @xmath102 t ) , temperature ( @xmath97 mk ) , and effective layer spacing ( @xmath103 ) are the same in each case .",
    "at this @xmath4  and @xmath5 the bilayer is relatively deep within the coherent @xmath0  phase .",
    "the three resonances differ in the amount of gate - induced density imbalance that is present : @xmath2  = 0 for the solid black trace , @xmath2  = 0.18 for the short dashed ( red ) trace , and @xmath2  = 0.32 for the long dashed ( blue ) trace . for both @xmath2",

    "in contrast , at @xmath2  = 0.32 the resonance is heavily distorted .",
    "this distortion is caused by low sheet conductivity in the low density layer ( @xmath105 @xmath32 ) of the imbalanced bilayer system .",
    "the two - terminal voltage across the sample includes substantial voltage drops within the plane of the low density layer and therefore exceeds the voltage drop across the tunnel barrier .",
    "the tunnel resonance consequently appears to be broadened and its amplitude is reduced .",
    "conventional in - plane transport measurements on the individual layers in the bilayer confirm that their longitudinal conductivity becomes extremely small",
    "when their density is reduced sufficiently and the temperature is low .",
    "this is not surprising since electrostatic gating reduces the density of mobile electrons in the 2des , but does not alter the number of charged impurities in the modulation doping layer . in effect , gating the density down creates a more disordered 2d electron gas . at sufficiently low density percolation",
    "will cease and the electron gas will become an insulator . as the density is reduced toward this point the sheet conductivity will eventually fall below the interlayer tunneling conductance and tunneling measurements will begin to fail .",
    "interestingly , in spite of the general decrease of the sheet conductivity in the low density layer , a ( distorted ) zero bias tunneling peak is still observed , demonstrating that some amount of interlayer coherence remains .",
    "we speculate that this somewhat paradoxical result may be due to strong inhomogeneities within the 2des , with pockets of interlayer coherent @xmath0  fluid surrounded by an incoherent bilayer system in which one layer has very low sheet conductivity .",
    "it is clearly essential to develop a criterion for distinguishing reliable @xmath0  tunneling data for which sheet conductivity effects may be safely ignored from data for which they can not .",
    "fortunately , the temperature dependence of the tunneling conductance offers a simple solution to this problem .",
