    "recently , locally repairable codes ( lrcs ) have attracted a lot of attention due to their applications in distributed storage systems .",
    "an @xmath0 $ ] linear code is called an lrc with locality @xmath3 if the value at each coordinate can be recovered by accessing at most @xmath3 other coordinates .",
    "an lrc with small locality @xmath3 is preferred in practice as it greatly reduces the disk i / o complexity in repairing node failures .",
    "meantime , large values of @xmath1 and @xmath8 are also desirable to ensure high level of storage efficiency and global fault tolerance ability respectively .",
    "much work has been done toward exploring the relationship between the parameters @xmath9 .",
    "the first trade - off is derived in @xcite , i.e. , @xmath10 which is also known as the singleton - like bound for lrcs .",
    "then various methods are developed to construct lrcs attaining the bound , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "tightness of the singleton - like bound is discussed in @xcite , and some improved bounds are derived in @xcite .    it can be seen the bound does not care about the field size . however , in practice lrcs over small finite fields , especially those over binary fields , are preferred due to their convenience in implementation . the first trade - off taking into consideration the field size is derived by cadambe and mazumdar @xcite , i.e. , @xmath11,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the largest possible dimension of an @xmath0 $ ] linear code over @xmath13 .",
    "this trade - off is usually called the c - m bound , and is proved achievable by the binary simplex codes @xcite .",
    "another class of binary lrcs with @xmath14 constructed via anticodes in @xcite also meets with equality .",
    "although these codes are optimal with respect to the c - m bound , their code length @xmath6 increases exponentially as the dimension @xmath1 grows , implying poor performance in information rate .",
    "alternatively , cyclic codes provides more desirable candidates for lrcs over small fields . in @xcite , binary lrcs with @xmath15 and @xmath16",
    "are constructed from primitive cyclic codes .",
    "these codes do not attain the c - m bound , but are shown to be optimal under a structural assumption that the codeword coordinates are divided into disjoint local repair groups .",
    "the same method is adopted in @xcite to generate binary lrcs with @xmath17 from nonprimitive cyclic codes . in @xcite ,",
    "bch - type binary lrcs are constructed as the subfield subcodes of optimal reed - solomon - type lrcs .",
    "besides , some other approaches for constructing lrcs that attain the singleton - like bound over small fields are also developed in @xcite .",
    "recently , two upper bounds taking the field size into account are derived in @xcite for @xmath18-lrcs . since @xmath18-lrcs @xcite contain lrcs as the special case of @xmath19 , these two bounds apply to lrcs as well . for @xmath20 ,",
    "the first bound is equivalent to the singleton - like bound , while the second one is a linear programming bound for lrcs with disjoint repair groups . on the other hand , asymptotic bounds on the parameters of lrcs",
    "are studied in @xcite .",
    "overall , most of the bounds derived so far for lrcs over particular finite fields either depend on undetermined parameters in coding theory , e.g. , the c - m bound , or rely on solving optimization problems under concrete code parameters , e.g. , the lp bound in @xcite . and the constructions of binary lrcs with good parameters mostly restrict to specific values of @xmath8 and @xmath3 .",

    "$ ] binary linear lrc @xmath21 , our main idea for deriving upper bounds on @xmath1 is to consider a related sphere packing problem in a particular space , namely , the @xmath22-space .",
    "specifically , an @xmath22-space of @xmath21 is defined to be the dual of the linear space spanned by a minimum set of local parity checks with overall supports covering all coordinates .",
    "actually , the @xmath22-space can be viewed as an lrc which contains @xmath21 as a subcode . then by applying the sphere packing bound in the @xmath22-space ,",
    "two upper bounds for @xmath21 are derived .",
    "firstly , assuming the code @xmath21 has disjoint local repair groups , we get an explicit bound ( i.e. corollary [ cordisjoint ] ) on @xmath1 for general values of @xmath23 . note that for @xmath15 and special forms of @xmath2 , upper bounds were also derived in @xcite .",
    "it turns out our bound contains their results as special cases .",
    "secondly , for linear binary lrcs with arbitrary local repair groups , we derive an upper bound ( i.e. theorem [ thmspb ] ) on @xmath1 based on solving an optimization problem .",
    "although it is generally difficult to solve this optimization problem , simplification can be done for @xmath4 , and thus an explicit upper bound ( i.e. theorem [ thm5 ] ) is derived . through a specific comparison ,",
    "we show this bound can outperform the c - m bound for @xmath5 and large values of @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , a class of binary linear lrcs with @xmath7 attaining this explicit bound is constructed .",

    "note by local parity checks we mean the codewords in the dual code @xmath39 with weight at most @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be a set of local parity checks of @xmath21 such that @xmath42 $ ] , and @xmath43 $ ] for any @xmath44 .",
    "we call @xmath45 an @xmath22-cover of @xmath21 . denote @xmath46 , then the dual space of @xmath47 , i.e. , @xmath48 , is called an @xmath22-space of @xmath21 .    obviously , an @xmath22-cover @xmath45 contains the minimum number of local parity checks guaranteeing the locality @xmath3 for all coordinates .",
    "@xmath45 needs not be unique , neither does the @xmath22-space @xmath49 .",
    "our proofs in this paper only depend on their existence which is ensured by the definition of lrcs .",
    "since @xmath45 only contains partial parity checks of @xmath21 , it follows that @xmath49 also defines an lrc containing @xmath21 as a subcode .",
    "investigating the structure of @xmath49 may help us to study the code @xmath21 . in the following ,",
    "we use the sphere - packing bound in the @xmath22-space @xmath49 , and obtain a connection between @xmath50 and @xmath49 .",
    "[ proplsb ] for an @xmath0 $ ] binary lrc @xmath21 with locality @xmath3 , it holds @xmath51 where @xmath52 , and @xmath49 is an @xmath22-space of @xmath21 .    for any codeword @xmath53 ,",
    "consider the ball of radius @xmath54 around @xmath55 in @xmath49 . since @xmath21 has minimum distance @xmath8 ,",
    "then these balls are non - overlapping .",
    "it follows that @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath58 , so we have @xmath59 . therefore can be written as @xmath60 since @xmath61 and @xmath62 , then the theorem follows directly from .",
    "the right hand side of depends on the locality space @xmath49 , so explicit bound can be derived from if @xmath49 is known . in the following , we apply proposition [ proplsb ] to a special class of binary linear lrcs which has a clear @xmath22-space .",
    "assume @xmath21 has local parity checks @xmath63 satisfying @xmath64 $ ] , @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "obviously , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "such an lrc is usually said to have _ disjoint local repair groups _ , which is widely adopted in constructions of lrcs , e.g. , @xcite . under this assumption ,",
    "the structure of the @xmath22-space @xmath49 becomes quite simple .",
    "then based on proposition [ proplsb ] , we derive the following upper bound .",
    "[ cordisjoint ] for any @xmath0 $ ] binary lrc @xmath21 with locality @xmath3 that has disjoint local repair groups , it holds @xmath70    note that @xmath71 is an @xmath22-cover of @xmath21 , then @xmath72 is an @xmath22-space of @xmath21 . by proposition  [ proplsb ]",
    ", it suffices to determine @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "clearly it has @xmath75 .",
    "note that the linear space @xmath76 has weight enumerator polynomial @xmath77 .",
    "then by the macwilliams equality , ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , the weight enumerator polynomial of @xmath49 is @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "thus we have @xmath80 and follows directly .",
    "the sphere packing approach was also used in @xcite to derive upper bounds on @xmath1 for binary linear lrcs with disjoint local repair groups . however",
    ", their approach only applies to the case of @xmath15 because it relies on a map from binary linear lrcs with @xmath15 to additive @xmath81-codes . our bound works for general values of @xmath23 , especially containing the bounds in @xcite as special cases . for example , suppose @xmath82 and @xmath15 , then corollary [ cordisjoint ] implies that @xmath83 which coincides with the theorem 1 in @xcite .",
    "another bound for lrcs with disjoint repair groups is the lp bound derived in @xcite .",
    "table [ table0 ] lists a comparison of the bound , the lp bound in @xcite and the c - m bound for @xmath84 . from the table we can see the bound is slightly weaker than the lp bound but tighter than the c - m bound .",
    "nevertheless , the bound has an explicit form and can be more easily implemented than the other two bounds .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for @xmath85 , it can be checked that the bound is inferior to the c - m bound .",
    "a reason causing this disadvantage is that in this case it has @xmath86 while the bound is derived by lower - bounding @xmath87 by its value in the case @xmath88 .",
    "if we use a better lower bound of @xmath89 instead of that used in the proof of theorem [ thm5 ] , an upper bound tighter than could be expected .",
    "however , we can not get an explicit bound in this case yet since the corresponding optimization problem is still very complicated .",
    "in this section , we give a new construction of binary linear lrcs .",
    "the code has minimum distance @xmath90 , and attains the upper bound in theorem [ thm5 ] .",
    "the construction relies on two matrices @xmath91 and @xmath92 defined as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath93 and @xmath94 are two positive integers such that @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",

    "define @xmath92 to be a matrix whose columns are all nonzero @xmath103-tuples from @xmath104 with first nonzero entry equal to @xmath105 .",
    "then @xmath92 is actually a parity check matrix of a @xmath106-ary hamming code , and the size of @xmath92 is @xmath107 .    by fixing a basis of @xmath104 over @xmath34 , each vector in @xmath108",
    "can be written as an element in @xmath104 and vice versa .",
    "we denote by @xmath109 the @xmath110 elements corresponding to the columns of @xmath91 , and denote by a vector @xmath111 the @xmath112th column of @xmath92 for @xmath113",
