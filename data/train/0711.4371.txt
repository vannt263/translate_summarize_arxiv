    "theoretical prediction of crystal surface morphological evolution has been an intensively active area of research for the past several decades .",
    "thanks to advances in computational methods and experimental techniques , our understanding of the microscopic physics driving crystal surface motion continues to improve .",
    "@xcite considerable attention has been devoted to nanoscale surface structures evolving via surface diffusion .",
    "their stability is crucial for their use as building blocks of novel small devices .    despite continued progress ,",
    "basic questions on epitaxial phenomena remain unanswered . in particular ,",
    "the relation of microscopic physics to continuum laws , e.g. , partial differential equations ( pde s ) for the surface height profile , is poorly understood .",
    "features on crystal surfaces evolve differently according to the temperature , @xmath0 . below the roughening temperature , @xmath1 , the discrete nature of the crystal is manifested by macroscopically planar surface regions ( facets ) and distinct nanoscale terraces which separate line defects , steps , of atomic height .",
    "the motion of steps drives surface morphological evolution , as first described by burton , cabrera and frank ( bcf ) .",
    "@xcite    continuum theories for crystal surfaces below @xmath1 must be the appropriate limits of step motion laws and are challenged near facets .",
    "@xcite by contrast , above @xmath1 steps are created spontaneously and surfaces appear smooth . in this case , continuum laws formulated via thermodynamics and mass conservation are well established .  @xcite    recently , margetis and kohn  @xcite derived systematically the continuum limit in 2 + 1 dimensions of a bcf - type model for interacting steps in the absence of material deposition from above .",
    "their formulation incorporates _ isotropic _ diffusion of adsorbed atoms ( adatoms ) on terraces and atom attachment - detachment at steps ; so , the terrace diffusivity is a scalar .",
    "their analysis invokes separation of local variables into fast and slow .",
    "a noteworthy element of the resulting theory is the _ tensor _ mobility in fick s law for the adatom flux ;  @xcite the corresponding mobility matrix is diagonal in the step coordinate system . in this setting",
    ", the surface relaxes to become flat via an interplay of step energetics and kinetics , and the aspect ratio of step topography brought about by the tensor character of the mobility .",
    "@xcite previous continuum theories invoked only a scalar macroscopic mobility , and thus missed the explicit influence of topography on evolution ; for a discussion see ref .  .    in this paper",
    "we extend the continuum theory to encompass richer kinetic processes : _ anisotropic _ adatom diffusion on terraces and atom diffusion _ along _ step edges . in terrace diffusion , we allow for a non - diagonal diffusivity which explicitly couples adatom fluxes normal and parallel to step edges .",
    "our goal is to derive continuum laws for surface relaxation that correspond more closely to realistic situations .",
    "we derive a nonlinear , parabolic fourth - order pde for the surface height from a large number of coupled differential equations of step motion . in this pde ,",
    "the surface mobility tensor has off - diagonal elements in the step coordinate system ; further , one of the diagonal elements is directly modified by step edge diffusion .",
    "we find plausible scaling laws with time via approximate , separable pde solutions .    as a starting point",
    ", we adopt the bcf model  @xcite by which individual steps move via mass conservation for atoms .",
    "each step interacts with its nearest neighbors .",
    "accordingly , coupled differential equations are obtained for step positions , which correspond to a discrete scheme .",
    "one approach is to solve this scheme numerically .",
    "this approach has been followed mainly for one - dimensional geometries .",
    "@xcite another approach is to view the step flow scheme as a discretization of a continuum evolution equation for the surface height ; and _ derive _ this equation in the appropriate limit of small step height and large number of steps . in this paper",
    "we focus on the second approach , which lends itself conveniently to numerics and prediction of decay laws for macroscopic surface features in two space dimensions .",
    "most previous continuum approaches to crystal surface morphological relaxation invoke isotropic physics for each terrace .",
    "@xcite however , nanoscale anisotropy is almost ubiquitous , and may stem from surface reconstruction and the substrate symmetry and structure .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we focus on terrace diffusion anisotropy , which is characterized by a tensor diffusivity and can influence pattern formation .",
    "@xcite we do not address anisotropy stemming from the step edge orientation dependence of parameters such as step line tension and stiffness ; the macroscopic limit with such parameters is studied in ref .  . a transformation that relates anisotropic adatom diffusion and step edge orientation dependence of step parameters",
    "is pointed out in ref .  .",
    "this last aspect lies beyond our present scope .",
    "we also include step edge diffusion  @xcite for completeness , since edge diffusion may be important in various experimentally accessible systems .",
    "@xcite in our formalism , the flux along an edge is driven by variations of the step chemical potential , the change per atom in the step energy upon addition or removal of atoms at a step edge .",
    "the inclusion of this effect necessarily modifies the surface mobility tensor .",
    "the continuum limit of these processes leads to a generalized relation of the form @xmath2 between the continuum - scale surface flux , @xmath3 , and the continuum step chemical potential , @xmath4 .",

    "this form of mobility does not describe experimental situations where hopping of adatoms couples the directions normal and parallel to step edges .",
    "this coupling is described by setting @xmath16 in the diffusivity matrix @xmath17 , which in turn yields @xmath18 . here , we determine each @xmath7 explicitly from the step flow model .",
    "there are several critical assumptions inherent to our analysis .",
    "our starting model originates from the mesoscale bcf description where steps are replaced by smooth curves .",
    "hence , we do not consider explicitly atomistic processes which occur at a smaller scale ; see e.g. ref .  .",
    "in our analysis , the terrace width , a microscopic length , is assumed to be much smaller than : ( i ) the macroscopic length over which the step density varies ; ( ii ) the step radius of curvature ; and ( iii ) the length over which the step curvature varies .",
    "step trains that satisfy ( i)(iii ) are referred to as `` slowly varying '' .",
    "the terrace width is comparable to or larger than the step height so that in the continuum limit the step density approaches the surface slope .",
    "we treat monotonic step trains with descending steps and vicinal terraces surrounding a top terrace ( peak ) , and do not address step motion near a bottom terrace ( valley ) .    in an attempt to obtain insights into solutions of the derived parabolic pde and plausible connections to experiments ,",
    "we find various scaling laws for the continuum - scale height profile , @xmath9 .",
    "here , the term `` scaling law '' describes the time - dependent part @xmath19 of a separable solution , @xmath20 ; see table  [ t : scaling laws ] .",
    "note that in principle the initial - boundary value problem for the pde is not guaranteed to admit separable solutions .",
    "this property relies crucially on the initial data .",
    "further , nonlinearities of the pde can play an important role introducing couplings not captured by scaling scenaria such as ours .",
    "we predict scaling laws previously identified for isotropic diffusion .",
    "@xcite    we do not address the numerical solution of the pde in this paper . a promising approach based on the finite element method when facets are absent is work in progress .",
    "another challenge is to solve the pde in the presence of facets , where explicit boundary conditions can be available only from discrete simulations .",
    "@xcite in the same vein , the validity of separable pde solutions is not studied in the present paper .",
    "we assume that the physics of each terrace , although allowed to be anisotropic , does not vary from one terrace to the next . hence",
    ", our model can not fully describe `` surface reconstruction '' , the situation where adatoms on neighboring terraces adapt differently to the missing bonds at the solid - vapor interface .",
    "@xcite we have neglected additional complications such as sublimation , material deposition from above , electromigration , and elasticity ; the last effect may induce long - range , beyond - nearest - neighbor step interactions .",
    "the inclusion of these influences in a more general pde for the surface height in 2 + 1 dimensions is the subject of future work .",

    "motion laws for step edges are determined via mass conservation for atoms : the step velocity is the sum of fluxes towards and along an edge .",
    "fluxes result from kinetic processes , including attachment and detachment of atoms at step edges , diffusion of adatoms on terraces , and diffusion of atoms along step edges .",

    "@xcite we assume that each step interacts only with its nearest neighbors . beyond - nearest - neighbor",
