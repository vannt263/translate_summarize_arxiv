    "the essence of radiotherapy with protons and heavier ions lies in precise control of incident particles that are designed to stop in tumor volume .",
    "the targeting precision will be inevitably deteriorated by multiple scattering in beam modifiers and patient body and such effects must be accurately handled for dose calculations in treatment planning .",
    "on the other hand , simplicity and efficiency are also essential in clinical practice and there has always been need for a computational method that balances all these demanding and conflicting requirements .",
    "fermi and then eyges ( 1948 ) developed a general theory for charged particles that undergo energy loss and multiple scattering in matter .",
    "a group of particles is approximated as a gaussian beam growing in space with statistical variances @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the longitudinal position and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the projected particle position and angle .",
    "the original fermi - eyges theory adopted purely gaussian approximation ( rossi and greisen 1948 ) with ( projected ) scattering power @xmath4 where @xmath5 mev is a constant , @xmath6 is the radiation length of the material , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 are the charge , the momentum , and the velocity of the particles .",
    "the fermi ",
    "rossi formula totally ignores effects of large - angle single scattering ( hanson 1951 ) and was found to be inaccurate ( wong 1990 ) .    based on formulations by highland ( 1975 , 1979 ) and gottschalk ( 1993 ) , kanematsu ( 2008b )",
    "proposed a scattering power with correction for the single - scattering effect , although within the gaussian approximation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the radiative path length .",
    "although it would be difficult to calculate integrals ",
    "because of the embedded integral in the @xmath12 terms , kanematsu ( 2008b ) further derived an approximate formula for the rms displacement of incident ions at the end point in homogeneous matter as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ion mass in units of the proton mass , @xmath15 is the expected in - water range on the incidence , @xmath16 is the stopping - power ratio of the matter relative to water , and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are constants .    despite the complex involvement of variable @xmath15 in , kanematsu ( 2008b ) found the @xmath19@xmath15 relation for ions in water to be very linear .",
    "in fact , preston and kohler of harvard cyclotron laboratory knew the linear relation and derived universal curve @xmath20 with @xmath21 for relative growth of rms displacement @xmath22 in homogeneous matter in an unpublished work in 1968 .",
    "starting with the empirical linear relation , this work is aimed to develop a simple and general multiple - scattering model to improve efficiency of numerical heterogeneity handling and to enable further analytical beam modeling .",
    "linear approximation @xmath23 for homogeneous systems greatly simplifies to @xmath24 where @xmath25 cm is the radiation length of water , @xmath26 is the scattering / stopping ratio of the material relative to water , and @xmath27 is the geometrical range .",
    "was calibrated to for water at @xmath28 .",
    "equation @xmath29 at the end point @xmath30 associates and as @xmath31 to lead to another scattering power @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the particle - type - dependent factor .",
    "the scattering power is inherently applicable to any heterogeneous system by numerical integral of .",
    "we examined these fermi - rossi , extended highland , and linear - displacement models with unpublished measurements by phillips ( hollmark 2004 ) , those by preston and kohler ( kanematsu 2008b ) , and molire - hanson calculations by deasy ( 1998 ) .",
    "we took growths of rms displacement @xmath34 with depth @xmath1 for @xmath35 cm protons , @xmath35 cm helium ions , and @xmath36 cm carbon ions in water and rms end - point displacements @xmath37 for them with varied incident range @xmath15 .",
    "for a point mono - directional ion beam with in - water range @xmath15 incident into homogeneous matter with constant @xmath16 and @xmath6 , equations  are analytically integrated to @xmath38 as a function of residual range @xmath39 at distance @xmath1 .",
    "in fact reduces to the universal curve by preston and kohler .",
    "a radiation field at a given @xmath1 position can be effectively or virtually modeled with a source , ignoring the matter ( icru-35 1984 ) .",
    "the effective extended source is at @xmath40 , where @xmath41 would be minimum in vacuum .",
    "the virtual point source is at @xmath42 , from which radiating particles would form a field of equivalent divergence .",
    "similarly , the effective scattering point is at @xmath43^{1/2}$ ] , at which a point - like scattering would cause equivalent rms angle and displacement ( gottschalk 1993 ) .",

    "( c ) end - point lateral shape of a proton pencil beam in water ( @xmath49 cm ) measured by preston and kohler ( @xmath48 ) and estimated by fermi - rossi ( dashed ) and the present ( solid ) formulations . ]",
    "\\(a ) shows rms - displacement growths @xmath34 and ( b ) shows rms end - point displacements @xmath37 .",
    "the present model was virtually identical to the extended highland model with deviations from measurements or molire - hanson calculations within either 2% or 0.02 cm , while the fermi - rossi model overestimated the rms displacements by nearly 10% .",
    "( c ) shows an end - point shape of a pencil beam measured by preston and kohler for @xmath49 cm protons in water and curves estimated by fermi - rossi and the present formulations with additional @xmath50 to @xmath51 for incident beam emittance in their experiment .",
    "the gaussian approximation was in fact adequate in this case .",
    "\\(a ) shows analytical variances @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath41 growing with depth @xmath1 for protons in water .",
    "( b ) shows the relative distances from current position @xmath1 to the effective extended source @xmath54 , the virtual point source @xmath55 , and the effective scattering point @xmath56 .",
    "they approach @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 at the @xmath60 limit .",
    "increase of the scattering power with depth moves these points relatively closer to the current position .",
    "in application of bragg peaks , the end - point displacement is the most important , for which the gaussian approximation was valid in the proton experiment by preston and kohler .",
    "in fact , the single - scattering effect is theoretically small for a thick target ( hanson 1951 ) .",
    "although ions suffer nuclear interactions with resultant fragments that generally scatter at large angles ( matsufuji 2005 ) , their contributions may be relatively less significant at the bragg peaks .",
    "the present formulation would be thus adequate for radiotherapy .    the linear - displacement model with the fermi - eyges theory has brought general formulas for ions , including the universal curve intuitively derived by preston and kohler without explicit formulation of the scattering power .",
    "in the present model , the kinematic properties are encapsulated in residual range @xmath61 that is always tracked in beam transport . the ion - type dependence in scattering angle and displacement is simply as proportional to @xmath62 , which leads to 50% for @xmath63he , 28% for @xmath64c , and 24% for @xmath65o with respect to that of protons for a given incident range .",
    "these numbers coincide with detailed numerical calculations by hollmark ( 2004 ) .",
    "the linearity between end - point displacement and range observed for water is the basis of the present model .",
    "its validity for general body - tissue materials is not obvious .",
    "we here examine water and two extreme elements hydrogen ( @xmath66 cm ) and calcium ( @xmath67 cm ) among major elements of body tissues ( icru-46 1992 ) , using in the extended highland model .",
    "shows their @xmath15@xmath19 relations with geometrical scale correction and indicates that the linearity will generally hold for body - tissue elements .",
    "however , the elemental linearity may not truly warrant the validity for systems heterogeneous in atomic compositions .",
    "the scattering power only depends on the residual range that is irrelevant to the multiple scattering accumulated in the other upstream materials , whereas the accumulation should influence the single - scattering effect ( kanematsu 2008b ) . in other words ,",
    "the present model implicitly assumes heterogeneity in density only .    in the current practice of treatment planning",
    ", the patient heterogeneity is normally modeled with variable - density water ( kanematsu 2003 ) , for which the present model is rigorous with further simplified scattering power @xmath68 the simplicity will minimize computation of the integrands in path integrals  for demanding dose calculations ( kanematsu 1998 , 2006 , 2008a ) .",
    "a novel multiple - scattering model has been formulated based on the fact such that the rms end - point displacement is proportional to the incident range in water .",
    "the model was designed to be equivalent with the extended highland model for stopping ions in water and agreed with measurements within 2% or 0.02 cm in rms displacement .",
    "the resultant scattering - power formula that is only inversely proportional to residual range is much simpler than former formulations and can be used in the framework of the fermi - eyges theory for gaussian - beam transport in tissue - like matter .",
    "the simplicity enables analytical beam modeling for homogeneous systems and improves efficiency of numerical path integrals for heterogeneous systems .",
    "the present model is ideal for demanding dose calculations in treatment planning of heavy - charged - particle radiotherapy .",
