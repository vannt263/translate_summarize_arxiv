    "i first met professor aoki some 15 years ago when the application of physics inspired methods was a rare appearance at economics conferences . yet",
    "already then masanao had an impressive amount of work applying statistical mechanics techniques to economic issues such as growth , employment , aggregation . since then , we kept meeting almost yearly at workshops , schools and conferences . beyond the technical interest in his work ,",
    "i felt great hope that masanao scientific vision and personality might help us achieve this fusion between the economic facts and ideas and between the physics techniques and popperian ethos @xcite .",
    "yet , the physical oceans separating us prevented what a posteriori feels like a great occasion of merging more intimately our ideas and methods .",
    "we take the present volume as a belated occasion to draw the lines along which such a synthesis or at least dialogue can take place",
    ". we will first list some of the converging interests , ideas and subjects and then will concentrate on a few more specific results .",
    "following schumpeter @xcite , aoki and yoshikawa attributed growth to the endogenous emergence of novelty . the introduction of new goods , the opening of new markets , the financial innovations do influence the firms of the real sector heterogeneously .",
    "after such an event ( /shock ) , many big firms start to shrink and some small firms start to grow .",
    "moreover , firms in previously dominating sectors disappear exponentially , while new sectors and firms capable of exploiting the new situation are established in growing numbers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] ) .",
    "schumpeter and the later evolutionary economists have ( sometimes with reserve ) likened this to biological evolution .",
    "aoki and yoshikawa , following montroll @xcite emphasized another common factor influencing economic and biological phenomena : the malthus - verhulst logistic equation .",
    "aoki considered very early @xcite a simpler version of such a dynamics which in fact is mathematically similar to the famous ak model @xcite eq .",
    "[ eq : eq25 ] .    in the present paper we elaborate on the connection between the theoretical predictions of such an approach and the empirical observations on the economic effects of technological , financial and political changes",
    ". moreover we explain , fit and predict the fractal / intermittent macroeconomic fluctuations as a result of the granular / multi - scale structure of the collective objects ( capital accumulations , economic sectors , geographical regions with outstanding productivity ) that aggregate the microeconomic elements ( money , investors , workers , technological know - how ) .    by doing",
    "so we transcend @xcite the representative agent approach giving macroeconomics a microeconomic foundation that is able to provide , in coherent conceptual framework , theoretical and numerical predictions in agreement with the empirical facts . such multi - agent non - equilibrium models are not the bread and butter of the neo - classical economics mainstream . in the past",
    "many economists @xcite deemed it impossible to deduce from first principles the collective dynamics underlying the macroeconomic properties .",
    "but masanao was not afraid to face these difficulties head - on .",
    "he used the master ( chapman - kolmogorov ) equation as a powerful method for the correct aggregation of microeconomic acts into macroeconomic behavior erasing thereby de facto the barrier between micro- and macro  economics @xcite . by applying exact methods he showed that in economic systems the fluctuations are not vanishing even when the number of components is taken to infinity : the statistical samples are not self - averaging and lead to macroscopic ( fractal , intermittent ) fluctuations . in this context , he found rigorous basis for the emergence of power laws in economic statistical distributions .",
    "masanao used the master ( fokker - planck ) equations also in order to characterize the clustering effects and the space - time aggregation processes responsible for macroeconomic fluctuations .",
    "such effects are indeed crucial for the economic growth .",
    "aoki s conclusions converge with the results obtained by physics techniques @xcite which predicted theoretically and validated empirically the equality between the pareto wealth distribution exponent and the fractal exponent characterizing the fluctuations of the stock markets and growth rates fig .",
    "[ fig : pareto ] and @xcite.this was an important step in transforming economics into a popperian science : the theoretical prediction connecting the individual wealth granularity to the fluctuations of aggregated economic and financial indexes has been very precisely validated by the empirical measurements @xcite @xcite @xcite such causal models which predict connections between structural ( granularity ) and dynamical ( fractal / intermittent fluctuations ) measurable properties of the economic systems provide a significant advancement beyond the mathematical identities connecting static variables provided by the neo - classical equilibrium assumptions .",
    "aoki s work connotes with schumpeter proposal @xcite of innovation as the intrinsic fundamental feature of capitalism . according to schumpeter , in order to achieve progress after an innovation , it is not sufficient to establish and develop the new firms and sectors applying it for production : it is equally important for the production means and organization related to the old technology to disappear ( cf .",
    "[ fig : crossing ] below ) .",
    "thus schumpeter coined the term creative destruction which makes bankruptcies , crisis and unemployment part of the economic progress .",
    "it connects the booms and crises in the global economic indices to the appearance , disappearance , shrinking and growing of collective economic objects ( firms , investor herds , large wealth accumulations , sectors , technologies , regions ) and their production .",
    "given the limitations in the mathematical methods available for multi - agent systems at the time , schumpeter s model was not formally and quantitatively tractable . as expressed mathematically by the non - self - averaging properties emphasized by aoki ,",
    "an economic system with many interactive agents and multi - scale granularity is exceedingly difficult to predict . yet",
    "the recognition of its importance for describing economic cycles continued to grow @xcite .",
    "masanao s vision and methods may find one of their most impactful applications in this direction .",
    "following the appearance of a new technology or new production conditions the economic system may undergo extensive changes : following such a shock , some sectors which might not even existed before , emerge , grow and their companies multiply .",
    "by contrast , some other sectors which were dominating before the change become not sustainable , they shrink and their companies disappear .",
    "this leads to the emergence of very interesting adaptive collective objects ( new sectors , new technologies , new silicon valleys , new start - up nations ) @xcite . in turn",
    ", the growth / shrinking / appearance / failure of the individual firms , sectors , technologies constitute the very stuff from which the global intermittent macroeconomic dynamics is made of .",
    "they are in the same time an embodiment of the schumpeter creative destruction scenario : the old economy is shrinking and innovative sectors appear and develop adaptively @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we will see that this picture has very precise implications on the short ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pareto ] ) and long ( figs . [",
    "fig : crossing ] , [ fig : double ] ) term fluctuations of the economic indices .",
    "these implications were confirmed with great precision by the empirical data figs .",
    "[ fig : pareto ] , [ fig : balkan ] , [ fig : poland ] .",
    "the crucial property that fuels the propagation of microeconomic events to systemic changes is autocatalicity. by the term autocatalytic we mean here a process or rather a quantity whose time variation is proportional to itself as expressed mathematically by eqs .",
    "[ eq : malthus]-[eq : malthus solution ] and [ eq : eq25]-[eq : matrixsolution ] .",
    "the origin of the concept of autocatalytic processes as the mechanism of systemic growth can be traced back 200 years to malthus @xcite .",
    "malthus ideas have been developed extensively by later workers .",
    "aoki cites montroll @xcite as attributing malthus - like dynamics to virtually all social systems .",
    "malthus applied it initially to the population growth but we shall see that the idea is relevant to economic growth and many other phenomena @xcite .    in modern agent - based language , malthus assumptions can be translated at the individual agent microscopic scale as follows :    * in the presence of sufficient resource units @xmath0 any ( female ) individual ( animal / human ) @xmath1 can generate with some probability rate per unit time @xmath2 another ( female ) animal / human : @xmath3 * each such individual has a death probability rate @xmath4 per unit time : @xmath5 * each @xmath1 and @xmath0 can diffuse by jumping between neighboring @xmath6 locations with probabilities per unit time @xmath7 and respectively @xmath8 .",
    "malthus implicitly assumed that the space @xmath9 and time @xmath10 density @xmath11 of the @xmath0 agents is constant , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "this seemed as a good assumption at the time .",
    "for instance , this is the macroscopic asymptotic equilibrium state if one assumes that the @xmath0 s diffuse randomly cf .",
    "[ eq : laplace ] .",
    "we will see later that this approximation that neglects the microscopic random fluctuations intrinsic to the discrete character of the @xmath0 individuals , is highly dangerous and misses most of the salient effects . by neglecting the space dependence of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 agents densities @xmath13 and @xmath14 and @xmath14 densities when discussing them in the macro- approximation where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are considered as functions defined on a space where the locations @xmath6 are real numbers .",
    "however one should not forget that the main point of this paper is that the macro / continuum approximation has severe limitations and the correct and binding formulation is the discrete one , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are just the number of agents @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the discrete location @xmath6 at time @xmath15 .",
    "] , malthus deduced an ordinary differential equation governing the time evolution of @xmath16 , the total number of @xmath1 s in terms of @xmath17 , the reproduction rate @xmath2 and the death rate @xmath4 .",
    ": , @xmath2 , @xmath17 , @xmath4 are not the standard ones in the malthus context .",
    "we use them here to facilitate the contact with the economist readership : with the present notations , eq .",
    "[ eq : malthus ] becomes identical with the familiar ak model eq .",

    "@xmath18 where one defined the growth rate @xmath19 by : @xmath20 eq .",
    "[ eq : malthus ] has the exponential solution a non - linear term @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath1 s competition , confrontation , limited resources and called the new equation _",
    "the logistic equation_. in terms of the agents the competition between @xmath1 s is expressed by the reaction : @xmath22 the verhulst non - linear term has the effect of diminishing the @xmath16 growth , @xmath23 , as @xmath16 increases and in fact eventually leads to the saturation of the @xmath24 population growth .",
    "thus , the solution of the logistic equation starts increasing in time with the same exponential growth rate @xmath19 as the malthus solution eq .",
    "[ eq : malthus solution ] , but eventually it curbs down and saturates . in the current discussion",

    "[ eq : malthus ] can faithfully represent the evolution of the total amount @xmath16 of @xmath1 self - reproducing agents : and differential @xmath28 notations when discussing the continuum approximation .",
    "however , one should remember that it is one of the main claims of the present paper that this approximation fails in crucial ways and that the correct formulation is the discrete one .",

    "so once one neglects the microscopic fluctuations of @xmath13 and considers it a continuous differentiable function , one is forced unavoidably into the eqs .",
    "[ eq : malthus ] and [ eq : malthus solution ] .",
    "however its has been shown that the very assumption that the system of discrete agents eqs .",
    "[ eq : s ] , [ eq : delta ] can be faithfully represented in terms of continuous differentiable functions @xmath13 and @xmath14 turns out to be false . if the growth factor is different for different locations and parts of the system , then the different exponentials of the type eq .",
    "[ eq : malthus solution ] at different locations lead to functions @xmath14 which are too singular to respect ( partial ) differential equations .",
    "in particular , the nave scalar ordinary differential equation eq .",
    "[ eq : malthus ] does not apply .",
    "we refer the reader to the original literature @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the rigorous proofs and present below only heuristic explanations and discussions of it .",
    "the most striking result obtained in these papers is that in large enough spaces with @xmath34 dimensions the @xmath1 population @xmath16 always grows irrespective of the values of @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath17 , @xmath8 , @xmath7 .",
    "the proof goes along the following points :    * one assumes that each agent @xmath0 has an equal probability to be originally situated at any of the locations @xmath6 in space .",
    "this means that the @xmath0 s are distributed by a poisson distribution eq .",
    "[ eq : poisson ] . *",

    "i.e. as the duration of the random walk is taken to infinity , each agent @xmath0 returns an infinite number of times to its original position . * during those visits home to its site of origin @xmath6 , each @xmath0 contributes an exponential factor to the @xmath14 expectation .",
    "* so , each @xmath0 originating at @xmath6 has a multiplicative contribution to @xmath14 expectation that increases exponentially in time .",
    "* thus , if at the beginning there are enough @xmath0 agents @xmath35 on a site @xmath6 then the product of their exponential growth contributions will be able to defeat / compensate any exponential decay with fixed negative rate originating in the @xmath1 s deaths ( due to @xmath4 ) and @xmath1 migration ( due to @xmath7 ) . * even if the above scenario requires a very large initial number @xmath35 of @xmath0 s to be originally at the site @xmath6 : @xmath36 still this has a finite ( even if exceedingly small ) probability @xmath37 .",

    "the expectation of @xmath16 grows faster than any exponential @xcite .",

    "such a probability distribution was of course studied extensively under the name of poisson distribution .",

    "[ eq : s ] , [ eq : delta ] using the combinatorial techniques of masanao or by field theory renormalization group techniques @xcite , or by branching random walk techniques @xcite .",

    "[ fig : balkan]).remarkably , it does it very economically in the occam razor sense by invoking a very small number of parameters that can be readily calibrated @xcite . in the cases where we were able to get enough detailed data the explanation for this remarkable simplicity is the dominance of the exponentials over other functional dependencies in the system .",
    "more precisely , it has been found in @xcite that after a shock , the economic sectors can be lumped to a good approximation in 2 parts / herds :    * the part that dominated the economy until the shock and undergoes destruction following the shock . * a part that was rather obscure before the shock but",

    "this trivial example gives an additional illustration of the following facts .",

    "an effect which is missed ( or rather included by hand / by dictum ) through the reduction of the model to just 2 components is the extreme resilience of the system with many components .",

    "[ fig : challet ] the policy of transfers between the stronger and weaker sectors can make the crisis shorter but deeper , more violent and severe or the opposite . the red line ( @xmath200 ) , corresponding to minimal government intervention is somewhat similar to the case of poland : the effect of the liberalization shock was very deep but very short and the recovery was very dramatic exiting the crisis with a very high growth rate . the blue line ( @xmath202 ) in fig .",

    "the result was that there was no recovery but going down from bad to worse .",
    "our models showed that one can design an interactive policy in which one does not fix from the beginning the amount of transfer but does it by momentary optimization @xcite .",

    "this was one of the cleanest examples of a creative destruction ( of the legacy of communist economy ) which not only the regulators did not try to harness but in fact deliberately initiated and allowed to unfold to its natural outcome .",
    "because of this , the liberalization in poland rightly deserved the label of shock therapy .",
    "the balcerowicz program ( as inspired by the ideas of jeffrey sachs ) has led to a lot of suffering in the first years but it lead to a very good take off by the entire country very quickly .",

    "the economy of most of the country ( the herd represented by the pink curve ) collapsed by 50% .",

    "note that the convergence in terms of the growth rates is very clear while in terms of production per capita the data for different counties is still divergent : in fig .",

    "the graphs and data were shifted vertically to account for the different number of counties in each set ( 16 for the most educated and 178 for the least educated ) .",
    "no effort was made to achieve exact fit between the real system and the 2x2 numerical experiment , but it is clear that the 2x2 captures the qualitative characteristics of the empirical data : + - the divergence of the growth rates during the initial schumpeter creative destruction phase ( before the vertical green line ) , + - the crossing exponentials , and + - the asymptotic frobenius - perron alignment of the growth rates , eqs .

    "the autocatalytic feedback loops techniques touched upon in this paper are capable of transcending the usual linear causality and to express in rigorous terms the spontaneous emergence of qualitatively novel properties as the collective effect of a multitude of random causes . in order to understand and control the evolution of mass phenomena such as the current crisis",

    "if on the contrary @xmath212 decays faster then @xmath213 the fluctuations will eventually bring the system arbitrarily far away from the original value .",
    "moreover , we will see that the behavior of @xmath212 informs about the nature of the individual steps of which the random walk consists . since the size of the individual steps",
    "are related to the individual collective objects that compose the system , @xmath212 can inform about the granular structure of the system .",
    "it is interesting that the time fluctuations of the global measurables are revealing the actual composition of the system .",
    "for instance the fluctuations of @xmath16 can inform of the collective objects ( herds , sectors , capital aggregates ) @xmath88 composing it : @xmath214 we will use this in order to characterize economic systems in various regimes :    1 .   if the inhomogeneous parts @xmath93 of @xmath16 ( islands , herds , mountains ) are small and mainly limited to the micro - scale , then their appearance , disappearance and motion amount to a random walk of the total @xmath16 with limited sized steps @xmath91 .",
    "such microscopic steps will lead to a gaussian , normal random walk whose fluctuations are negligible at the macroscopic level .",
    "if the dynamic collective objects composing @xmath16 are scaling , e.g. if their sizes are distributed by a pareto - zipf power law @xmath215 then the @xmath16 fluctuations are scaling as @xmath216 + typically for the individuals capital in the western economies @xmath217 which insures the same @xmath101 for the stock market index @xmath87 .",
    "see fig . [",
    "fig : pareto ] for empirical realizations of this prediction . for @xmath102 one",
    "returns to the regime 1 .",
    "3 .   for @xmath104 the majority of the capital @xmath16",
    "is concentrated in the first terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : k zipf ] ( e.g. dominant economic sectors @xmath218 , @xmath219 ) .",
    "thus the fluctuations themselves follow the macroscopic changes in those @xmath218 , @xmath219 parts and in particular in their crossing : the substitution - following a shock - of the largest @xmath220 by a new one .",
    "the result is intermittent dynamics of the economic cycles type .",
    "however as opposed to the typical depiction of the economic cycle fluctuations where both the maxima and the minima are smooth , in our case * maxima are cusps * and in between @xmath16 is a smooth sum of 2 exponentials ( corresponding to the old and new dominant @xmath221 s ) ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : balkan ] ) .",
    "let us start with the case when the step sizes have a flat probability density uniformly distributed between @xmath222 and @xmath223 : @xmath224\\\\      0 , & \\text{otherwise}.    \\end{cases } \\label{eq : gauss term prob}\\ ] ] for long time intervals , during which many individual steps @xmath15 took place , the accumulated change in @xmath16 is the sum of the individuals steps : @xmath225 consequently the variation of @xmath16 within a time interval of @xmath15 individual steps is given according to the central limit theorem by a gaussian , normal distribution : @xmath226 with a standard deviation extending as @xmath227 : @xmath228    the peak of this distribution eq.[eq : gauss ] decays for long time intervals @xmath15 like a power @xmath229 of @xmath15 : @xmath230 this is a general property of the time evolution of probability stable distributions ( distributions that preserve up to a scale their shape ) : since their integral has to remain @xmath231 , the increase of their width in time has to be compensated by a corresponding lowering in time of their height : @xmath232    reciprocally since the integral of the probability density over all the possible values of @xmath233 has to be @xmath231 , a slow decrease like [ eq : gausspolya ] in its height at the @xmath234 peak @xmath235 implies a slow expansion of its width with roughly the same rate : @xmath236 thus a for slow decays of @xmath212 with @xmath15 one will have an evolution of @xmath16 for which the stochastic part @xmath237 does not take it far away from the causal part which is typically @xmath238 .",
    "this is important for the study of the properties of the @xmath16 fluctuations . indeed , by definition the extreme fluctuations are exceedingly rare and influenced by the finite size of the system and of the observation time .",
    "this makes the measuring of the extreme fluctuations nearly impossible and also useless from the theoretical point of view ( because of the contamination of the ideal theoretical values by finite size and finite time corrections . thus connecting the large fluctuations behavior of @xmath16 to the behavior of the central peak is an important step to obtain information on the character of the fluctuations of @xmath16 and to discriminate between the various regimes with great reliability and precision :    * as opposed to extremely large and extremely rare events with @xmath239 the frequency of events with @xmath240 is very high , insuring high statistics , high precision measurements .",
    "* the small size ( in fact @xmath70 ) of the variation @xmath241 makes the measurement less sensitive to the finite size and finite time effects .",
    "of course indirectly , the finite size enters in the statistics of the ensemble of measurements values but it does not affect directly and strongly in the actual @xmath241 measured value of the events entering @xmath212 ( as it does for measurements of @xmath108 with very large @xmath239 @xcite ) .",
    "consequently we used @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite the time decay of the central peak @xmath212 of the probability density of @xmath242 as a measure of the stability of the dynamics of @xmath16 .",
    "i.e. of the behavior of its large , fractal fluctuations .",
    "by contrast to the case in which the size of the individual steps is bounded to a microscopic scale @xmath223 the fluctuations of the herds / islands / large fortune s sizes in the autocatalytic models presented in this paper may spread up to the macroscopic / system scale .",
    "assume the objects @xmath89 composing the system of size @xmath16 are ordered in decreasing size @xmath88 order .",
    "assume they follow at each moment a pareto - zipf law : @xmath243 ( not necessarily in the same order @xmath89 at different times ) .",
    "thus the appearance / disappearance / shrinking / growth of the collective objects consists from the point of view of @xmath16 into a fractal / intermittent random walk .",
    "i.e a random walk in which the step sizes @xmath246 have a scaling probability distribution : @xmath247    the properties of such random walks were introduced by paul levy and popularized by mandelbrot @xcite . instead of a gaussian process , the resulting @xmath91 dynamics will consist of a levy flights process @xmath248 of index @xmath101 .",
    "there is no analytic formula for the levy probability density @xmath248 .",
    "but one can deduce the time evolution of its width @xmath249 and of the height of its central peak @xmath250 ( recall their product is a constant because of the integral of a probability density has to remain 1 at all times ) from the following argument .    according to eq . [ eq : psteplevy ] the waiting time for a step of size at least @xmath251 to appear is : @xmath252 thus , reciprocally the largest value of a single step @xmath251 expected to appear within a time interval @xmath15 will be @xmath253 for @xmath254 this single step dominates the contributions of all other steps to the variation of @xmath16 : @xmath255 thus , the largest individual step expected to appear in a given time steps interval @xmath15 dominates the time dependence of the standard deviation @xmath249 of the probability density and consequently also its height @xmath256 : @xmath257 this means that the probabilityfor @xmath16 to be back at the original value after a time @xmath15 decreases with @xmath15 as @xmath258 .",
    "this is faster than in the gaussian case because if @xmath259 .",
    "reciprocally , the speed by which the system diffuses away from an original value that it had at the beginning of a time interval @xmath15 is @xmath260 , faster than in the gaussian case .",
    "moreover , both time evolutions are dictated by the same exponent @xmath101 that characterizes the step size distribution eq .",
    "[ eq : psteplevy ] . in turn",
    "the step sizes depend on the sizes of the collective objects that define the granularity of the system ( in the present case on the pareto - zipf exponent @xmath101 of the power law : eq . [ eq : zipf law ] ) .",
    "this connection between the sizes of the mezo - economic objects ( large wealths , geographical regions capital , economic sectors ) and the time changes in the economic indices ( market fractal fluctuations , gdp intermittent cycles ) is the main message of our analysis .",
    "* for a granularity dominated by small collective objects @xmath262 the approximation eq .",
    "[ eq : levy sum ] does not hold because the finite / microscopic size steps [ eq : gauss term prob ] already imply a faster spread eq .",
    "[ eq : gauss sigma ] of @xmath263 cf .",
    "[ eq : sd ] . * for a granularity dominated by the largest collective objects @xmath104 the evolution of @xmath16 due to fluctuations is faster than what would be expected from a regular causal dynamics with finite speed ( i.e. change in @xmath16 proportional to the time interval @xmath15 ) .",
    "in fact this means that the fluctuations are taking the values of @xmath16 in an accelerated way far from its original position .",
    "moreover , @xmath264 reaches very quickly the limits imposed by the finite size in the system implying that the dynamics reduces to steps that are of the system size : @xmath16 can take `` any value '' ; for long times , the system does nt even have an average @xmath265 .    in conclusion ,",
    "depending on the level of granularity of the herds / sectors / capital accumulations / production clusters involved we have 3 regimes of the time fluctuations of the global economic indices :    * for relatively small size clusters ( limited scale steps or very rare medium scale ones ) * @xmath102 * one recovers the gaussian regime [ eq : gauss width ] .",
    "the time fluctuations remain microscopic and of negligible relative scale @xmath266 .",
    "* for larges clusters / herds imposing larger unit steps that behave like eq .",
    "[ eq : psteplevy ] with @xmath103 the time fluctuations are not normal / gaussian and are in the levy / fractal domain in mandelbrot terminology .",
    "this is the case of the stock market indices with the caveat that for very large values the limitations in the size of the system / its components affect the very distant tails @xcite .",
    "the connection between the granularity of the individual wealth ( measured by the pareto exponent in eq .",
    "[ eq : levytstep ] ) and the fractal exponent of the market index fluctuations ( measured by the exponent of @xmath250 eq .",
    "[ eq : levy width ] ) has been verified empirically in a number of countries @xcite .",
    "[ fig : pareto ] . * for a distribution in which the largest clusters are of the systems size ( e.g. size steps scaling with @xmath104 eq . [ eq : psteplevy ] )",
    "the fluctuations are so strong that essentially the system is completely dominated by the largest steps sizes .",
    "we will see ( sections [ sec : predictions ] and [ sec : empirical ] @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) that this establishes a very direct connection between the intermittent cyclic variations in @xmath16 and the individual wealth / cluster / herd granularity ."

    "<S> in particular , we present some theoretical predictions , which also met extensive validation from empirical data in a wide range of systems :    * the fractal levy exponent of the stock market index fluctuations equals the pareto exponent of the investors wealth distribution . the origin of the macroeconomic dynamics is therefore found in the granularity induced by the wealth / capital of the wealthiest investors . </S>",
    "<S> * economic cycles consist of a schumpeter creative destruction pattern whereby the maxima are cusp - shaped while the minima are smooth . in between the cusps , the cycle consists of the sum of 2 crossing exponentials : one decaying and the other increasing .    </S>",
    "<S> this unification within the same theoretical framework of short term market fluctuations and long term economic cycles offers the perspective of a genuine conceptual synthesis between micro- and macroeconomics . joining another giant of contemporary science - phil anderson @xcite - aoki emphasized the role of rare , large fluctuations in the emergence of macroeconomic phenomena out of microscopic interactions and in particular their non self - averaging , in the language of statistical physics . in this light , we present a simple stochastic multi - sector growth model . </S>"
