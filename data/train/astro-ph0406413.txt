    "the region was imaged through a narrow - band ( 54 ) filter , centered at 4110 .",
    "this was sensitive to ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies at @xmath5 .",
    "37 candidate galaxies were found .    these candidate @xmath3",
    "galaxies mostly lie in a filamentary structure , over 80 co - moving mpc in length .",
    "this filament is seemingly bracketed by voids on both sides . in paper",
    "1 we argue that this structure is statistically significant , and that the size of the voids and the filament is larger than would be expected from cdm ( cold dark matter ) simulations .",
    "we did not , however , have spectra of the candidate high redshift galaxies .",
    "it was thus possible that some or all of them were actually foreground galaxies : galaxies lying at @xmath6 whose 3727line lies within the filter bandpass .",
    "even if they were ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies at @xmath3 , their observations only constrained the two dimensional position of the galaxies and not their precise redshift .    in this paper , we present confirmation spectroscopy of these galaxy candidates .",
    "we demonstrate that candidates are indeed primarily @xmath3 ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies , and we constrain the three - dimensional shape of the claimed filament .",
    "our spectroscopy was carried out using the two degree field ( 2df ) multi - fiber spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope ( aat , * ? ? ?",
    "this spectrograph has 400 fibers , spread over a circular field of diameter two degrees , located at the prime focus of the aat .",
    "fibers were allocated to targets using the _ configure _ program @xcite .",
    "first priority in the fiber allocation was given to the candidate z=2.38 galaxies identified by @xcite ( the main sample ) .",
    "we were able to allocate fibers to all but two of these ( the two unobserved sources , those at 21:40:33.1 -44:36:10.8 and 21:43:05.9 -44:27:21.0 , j2000 , lay too close to other candidate galaxies for fiber allocation ) .",
    "second priority was 26 brighter point sources which also showed excess narrow - band flux : these were potential z=2.38 qsos .",
    "three of these were too bright for us to observe , but we were able to allocate fibers to twenty of the remaining twenty - three ( the point source sample ) .",
    "the candidate list of @xcite only included sources with excess narrow - band emission of equivalent width @xmath7 .",
    "this was done to minimize contamination from foreground [ ] emitting galaxies , but may also have eliminated some ly@xmath0 emitting sources . to check this , we selected a sample of 86 sources which showed excess emission in the narrow band , but not enough to meet this equivalent width threshold ( the low equivalent width sample ) .",
    "we were able to allocate fibers to 70 of these sources .",
    "211 uvx sources were selected , as possible foreground qsos .",
    "we were able to allocate fibers to 120 of these ( the uvx sample ) .",
    "four candidate color - selected high redshift qsos were also observed .",
    "fibers were allocated to 17 chandra sources : these will be discussed by williger et al ( in preparation ) .",
    "observations were carried out on the nights of 2003 august 31 and september 1 .",
    "conditions were poor : the first night was mostly cloudy , and the second night , while clear , suffered from @xmath8 seeing .",
    "we obtained a total integration time of 5400 sec on the first night and 32,400 sec on the second night , though much of this was obtained at high airmass , or while the moon was up .",
    "the first night s data were reduced quickly , allowing us to identify several foreground galaxies amongst the low equivalent width sample . the fiber configuration was changed for the second night by eliminating these sources , allowing us to observe more of the various lower priority samples .",
    "this also means that the higher priority sources were observed through different fibers on the different nights , giving us a check against systematic errors .",
    "we used the 600v gratings in both the 2df spectrographs , centered at a wavelength of 4982 .",
    "this gave a spectral resolution of 450 @xmath9 and a wavelength range of 3890  6080 .",
    "the data were reduced using the _ 2dfdr _ software @xcite .",
    "spectra from each night were co - added separately , as a check on the reality of any faint features seen .",
    "a weighted sum of the spectra from both nights was then used in the final analysis .",
    "all spectra were classified interactively . for sources showing a single narrow emission line at @xmath10 , we classified them either as @xmath11 ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies or @xmath6 [ ] emitting blue compact galaxies using the following criteria :    * if we see corresponding [ ] and/or h@xmath12 emission lines , we identify the source as an [ ] emitting galaxy at @xmath6 . *",
    "if we see corresponding emission line , we identify the source as a ly@xmath0 emitting galaxy at @xmath3 . *",
    "if the @xmath10  line has a velocity width @xmath13 , and no other lines are seen , we classify the line as ly@xmath0 at @xmath3 , on the basis that the [ ] emission of a blue compact galaxy is unlikely to be this broad . * the remaining three sources ( with single narrow lines ) were classified as ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies at @xmath3 , on the basis that had they been at @xmath6 , we should have been seen [ ] emission ( our @xmath6 galaxies have a median flux calibrated ratio of [ ] /[]= 1.7 ) . one of these three was confirmed by @xcite to lie at @xmath3 .",
    "the detection of an emission - line is regarded as secure if it is seen at greater than @xmath14 confidence .",
    "if seen at between 3 and 5 @xmath15 confidence , it is regarded as marginal .",
    "we were able to obtain secure spectral classifications for most sources down to an emission - line surface brightness @xmath16 .",
    "we observed 14 candidates down to this limit .",
    "10 were securely classified as @xmath3 ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies , and two more were marginally confirmed as the same .",
    "one of the remaining sources was the bizarre b5 , discussed below , and the other showed clear stellar absorption and is hence a foreground source .",
    "three of the securely confirmed sources had previous spectral confirmation @xcite .    at fainter surface",
    "brightnesses our sucess rate was lower .",
    "of the 21 remaining sources we observed , we were only able to obtain a secure spectral classification for 6 , and a marginal classification for another 9 .",
    "all were classified as @xmath3 ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies .",
    "no spectral features were detected in the remaining 6 sources .",
    "we show spectra of the securely confirmed @xmath3 ly@xmath0 emitters in fig  [ confirmed1 ] , and list their properties in table  [ confirmed ] .",
    "those with only marginally ( 3  5@xmath15 ) detected ly@xmath0 lines are shown in fig  [ marginalp ] and their properties listed in table  [ marginalt ] .",
    "composite spectra of all sources classified as @xmath3 ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies were constructed ( figs  [ secure_comp ] & [ marginal_comp ] ) by shifting the spectra to align the centroid of the putative ly@xmath0 line at a nominal wavelength of 1216 . if a significant fraction of these sources were foreground [ ] emitting galaxies , we would expect to see h@xmath12 and [ ] in these composite spectra , shifted to 1585  and 1633  respectively",
    ". nothing is seen at these wavelengths : instead c  iv is weakly detected in the composite of the securely confirmed sources .",
    "a close - up of the ly@xmath0 region of these composite spectra ( fig  [ asym ] ) does not show evidence of asymmetry in the profiles .",
    "the individual spectra are too poor to check for asymmetry , though in our previous spectrum of b1 , strong asymmetry was seen @xcite .",
    "this does not rule out a systematic asymetry in these lines , as it could have been washed out by centroiding errors in these noisy spectra .",
    "we are unable to look for evidence of a continuum break across the ly@xmath0 line due to the difficulty in accurately sky - subtracting 2df spectra .",
    "one source , b5 ( coordinates 21:43:03.57 -44:23:44.2 , j2000 ) , proved impossible to classify .",
    "b5 is one of the most luminous narrow - band excess sources , and in paper  1 we classified it as a ly@xmath0 blob .",
    "our image of it shows that the excess narrow - band flux is centrally concentrated , but clearly extended .",
    "our spectrum ( fig  [ b5spec ] ) shows two clear broad emission lines : one at 4110  and the other at 5930 .",
    "both lines , though noisy , are independently seen in the co - added data from each night , and must therefore be regarded as secure . a more marginal candidate broad line",
    "is possibly seen at 4440 .",
    "the breadth of the lines ( @xmath17 ) clearly indicates that this is a qso . the fact that b5 shows extended narrow - band fuzz suggests that the line at 4110  is either ly@xmath0 or [ ] . if the former , however , the 5930  line would have a rest - frame wavelength of @xmath18 , which does not correspond to any normal qso emission line @xcite . if the latter , we do not see any balmer lines or [ ] , and the 5930  line would lie at rest - frame 5390 ; another wavelength which does not correspond to any strong qso line .",
    "no alternative identification of the lines works any better .",
    "a higher quality spectrum with wider wavelength coverage is clearly needed .",
    "three of the securely confirmed @xmath3 galaxies show significant c  iv in emission .",
    "two of these ( b38 and b39 ) have ly@xmath0 velocity widths greater than @xmath19 and are thus probable qsos .",
    "the remaining source ( b23 ) , while its ly@xmath0 emission is relatively narrow ( @xmath20 ) appears to have much broader c  iv emission .",
    "these sources may thus all be qsos , albeit width host galaxy light contributing to their spatially extended images .",
    "our spectroscopy thus demonstrates that down to a narrow - band flux surface brightness limit of @xmath1 , the vast majority of our candidates are indeed ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies at @xmath3 .",
    "there is nothing in our data to suggest that this fraction is not comparable for the fainter sources , but deeper data will be required to confirm this .",
    "thirteen of the twenty point source sample objects observed were qsos with a broad emission line within the narrow - band filter bandpass .",
    "only one of these , however , ( fig  [ qsos ] ) was at the filament redshift : ten lie at @xmath21 which places within the passband .",
    "the other two lie at z=0.457 and z=1.458 , placing and respectively in the passband .",
    "two of the remaining sources had no significant features in their spectra , and the other two were low redshift compact emission - line galaxies ( one with [ ] in the passband ) .",
    "a further 41 qsos were found in the uvx sample , and three in the low equivalent width sample .",
    "three of the uvx qsos lie at higher redshifts than our candidate filament , and are shown in fig  [ qsospec ] .",
    "all qsos identified are listed in table  [ qsos ] .",
    "given our restricted wavelength coverage , we often see only a single emission line : these one line sources are noted in the table , and given redshifts typically assuming that this line is . qsos with lines",
    "only marginally detected are indicated with question marks .",
    "we detect 19 galaxies whose redshifts place [ ] within the passband of our filter .",
    "these , together with other foreground emission - line galaxies , are listed in table  [ gals ] .",
    "in paper  1 , we showed that the two - dimensional positions of the candidate @xmath3 galaxies on the sky was non - random , and that the two - dimensional void probability function measured from these candidates was marginally inconsistent with one set of cold dark matter simulations .",
    "we repeated this analysis , adding in the confirmed @xmath3 qso but removing the confirmed foreground source .",
    "this made no appreciable difference to the results from paper  1 .",
    "we then repeated the analysis using only those candidates with secure spectral confirmation , and again combining these with the marginally confirmed candidates .",
    "both analyses gave results consistent with those in paper  1 , but with larger error bars .",
    "in neither case , however , was the measured void probability function inconsistent with the cold dark matter simulations with 95% confidence .",
    "the three - dimensional distribution of the galaxies is discussed in   [ vel ] .",
    "we show in   [ main ] that for sources above our surface brightness limit , at least 70% lie at @xmath3 .",
    "we further show that there is no spectral evidence that any of the main sample sources are foreground [ ] emitting galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "a further test for any population of foreground interlopers is the distribution of our candidates on the sky . in fig  [ o2pos ] and fig  [ filplot ] ,",
    "we show that the projected distribution of confirmed foreground @xmath6 galaxies is quite different from that of the candidate @xmath3 galaxies , being concentrated on the cluster abell 3800 @xcite .",
    "fig  [ filplot ] also demonstrates that the sources for which we have secure spectral confirmations are scattered throughout the cliamed filament , rather than all being gathered in one region .",
    "there is a relative deficit of securely confirmed sources in the center of the filament , but the three confirmed sources that do lie in this region were those studied by @xcite , all of which have secure multi - line spectroscopic confirmation .",
    "the redshifts of the sources at the top and bottom of the filament show no significant differences , so there is no evidence in this data set for the filament being simply two clusters with a few stray sources lying between them , though this model can not be ruled out .      if the putative filament were inclined to our line of sight , we might expect to see a redshift gradient along it , as was seen by @xcite in their much smaller filament .",
    "no such correlation was seen : a plot of ly@xmath0 wavelength against position along the filament contains neither a gradient nor any sub - structure .",
    "the distribution of all ly@xmath0 redshifts is shown in fig  [ lyhist ] .",
    "the mean redshift ( including both secure and marginal candidates ) is @xmath22 , with a standard deviation of @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding figures for sources with secure redshifts only are @xmath24 and @xmath20 .",
    "the standard deviation in the observed redshifts is comparable to the average ly@xmath0 line width of the individual galaxies ( @xmath25 , or @xmath26 if we subtract in quadrature the instrumental resolution , table  [ confirmed ] ) . as the ly@xmath0 line is probably extremely optically thick",
    ", one would expect the observed line peak to be offset from the true systemic redshift by of order the line width .",
    "thus the scatter in the observed redshifts may be purely an artifact of the optical depths : we have no significant evidence for an intrinsic scatter .",
    "measurement of the velocity structure will require observations in a line less optically thick .",
    "are we really seeing a concentration of sources at a particular wavelength , or is the measured wavelength dispersion simply an artifact of the bandpass of our selection filter ?",
    "fig  [ lyhist ] suggests that the observed redshift distribution is more sharply peaked than the filter bandpass , and that the peak lies at a slightly longer wavelength .",
    "we tested this by monte - carlo simulating samples of randomly distributed galaxies observed through this filter , assuming a ly@xmath0 luminosity function with @xmath27 , as used in @xcite .",
    "slightly fewer than 0.1% ( 0.6% for secure sources only ) of the simulations have measured velocity dispersions as low as we obtained .",
    "the statistical difference is mostly driven by the relative lack of observed lines lying in the wavelength range 4085  4105 : ie .",
    "the observed galaxy distribution has a lower redshift cut - off .",
    "but does it have a higher redshift cut - off , or is the lack of observed galaxies with ly@xmath0 wavelengths longer than around 4125  caused only by the filter bandpass ?",
    "once again , we tested this using our monte - carlo simulations . slightly fewer than 1% of simulations having the same sample size as the combined secure and marginal samples had as few sources long - ward of 4125  as we saw , but if we restrict ourselves to sources with secure spectral classifications only , this fraction rises to 10% .",
    "we conclude that we are probably looking at a filament viewed from within @xmath28 of sideways , rather than an edge - on sheet .",
    "there remains a small possibility that it is a sheet but that we are only sampling its front edge , as we do not definitively detect a higher redshift cut - off .",
    "only one qso was found in the point source sample at the filament redshift : would we have expected more ? in the point source sample , we are effectively finding qsos down to @xmath29 . extrapolating the qso luminosity functions of @xcite , allowing for qsos to be selected in our narrow - band filter",
    "even if only part of their broad ly@xmath0 emission is within the filter bandpass and for our incomplete spectroscopy , we would expect 0.75 qsos to have been found , if the region studied was not overdense in them .",
    "thus the observations are quite consistent with this region being average .",
    "in paper  1 we reported that the filament region had an overdensity of ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies of @xmath30 .",
    "is this consistent with the observation of only one qso ? using poisson statistics ,",
    "if the region were overdense by a factor of 4 , we d find one or fewer qsos 20% of the time .",
    "thus finding only one qso is consistent with such an overdensity , though favoring lower values .",
    "perhaps the greatest surprise is the 10 qsos identified with @xmath31 , which places some or all of their emission in the narrow - band filter . from the @xcite luminosity functions , we d predict only 1.8 qsos in this range .",
    "the poisson probability of finding 10 , if the field were not overdense , is only 0.5% .",
    "we therefore conclude that a cluster of qsos lies in the foreground of our field at @xmath2 .",
    "note that all ten were identified by their uvx emission as well as their excess narrow - band flux .",
    "in fig  [ qsocluster ] we show the distribution of these qsos .",
    "it is clearly non - random : they are concentrated into the south - east corner of the field .",
    "the overdensity of qsos within this region is @xmath32 with 95% confidence .",
    "could gravitational lensing by this cluster , plus abell 3800 , be responsible for the filament and voids seen at z=2.38 ?",
    "cluster lensing could certainly be amplifying a handful of individual sources , but expected magnifications over the enormous extent of our field are insignificant .",
    "the spectroscopy presented here demonstrates that the brighter candidate filament members do indeed lie at redshift @xmath33 , and that the candidate list is not extensively contaminated by @xmath34 interlopers .",
    "we can also tentatively conclude that the galaxies we see do indeed lie in a one - dimensional filament , and not a slice through some two dimensional sheet .",
    "these results lend credence to our claim ( in paper  1 ) that galaxies at high redshifts are distributed in filaments separated by voids . a definitive test of this claim will , however , require the systematic mapping of more and larger volumes of the high redshift universe",
    ".    curiously , the filament region is not overdense in qsos , but we find a significant cluster of foreground qsos at @xmath21 .",
    "one qso was found lying within the filament , as were three background qsos .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of these qsos may allow us to constrain the gas within the filament and voids , as has already been done for the three background qsos previously known @xcite .",

    "<S> in paper 1 of this series we identified an 80 co - moving mpc filament of candidate ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies at redshift 2.38 . in this paper we present spectroscopy of the 37 galaxy candidates . </S>",
    "<S> our spectroscopy reached a surface brightness limit of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> of the 14 candidates down to this limit , 12 were confirmed to be ly@xmath0 emitting galaxies at the filament redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtained spectral confirmation for six of the lower surface brightness candidates , all of which also lay at the filament redshift . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we identify a foreground cluster of qsos at @xmath2 . </S>"
