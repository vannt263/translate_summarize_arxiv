    "we obtain the bijection from condensed catalan tableaux to catalan paths by first constructing a modified catalan tableau that is in bijection with both the condensed catalan tableaux and the catalan paths .",
    "the direct correspondence between modified catalan tableaux and condensed catalan tableaux of the same shape can be observed in the example given in figure [ path_bijection ] ( b ) .",

    "given a weighted catalan path , for each vertical segment that is not on the west boundary of the young diagram , draw a @xmath1 in the box directly to the left .",

    "we prove narayana s formula using induction on the number of rows .",
    "first , if the young diagram has a single row of length @xmath56 , all paths in that diagram have exactly one south - step , for which there are @xmath57 possible locations including the left - most and right - most edges of the diagram .",
    "thus there are @xmath57 such paths , which equals the single entry which is also the determinant of the matrix @xmath58 .",
    "now , let us assume the formula above holds for counting the paths in all diagrams containing up to @xmath59 rows .",
    "we first observe that the bottom right @xmath60 minor of @xmath61 equals the matrix @xmath62 , and so its determinant counts the number of paths on the shape @xmath63 .",

    "this is because step 1 presumes that the collection of south - steps starting from row 2 is legal , in particular that the pair of south - steps in rows 2 and 3 is legal .",
    "thus , we must add back in all combinations of the form shown in figure [ illegal ] ( c ) .",
    "the possibilities for the top 3 rows are counted by @xmath77 , and the possibilities for all paths starting from row 4 are given by @xmath78 , so their product is the third term of the determinantal expansion .",

    "similarly to the above , this is due to the fact that the steps 1 through @xmath82 only accounted for terms that had a valid collection of south - steps starting from row @xmath82 .",

    "we prove this formula analogously to the proof of narayana s path - counting formula by an inductive argument , except that now instead of letting each path have weight 1 , we assign the weights to the catalan paths according to the bijection given in section [ sec_bijection ] . in particular , in narayana",

    "similarly , to prove theorem [ main_thm ] , we enumerate the possible catalan paths by , for each successive row of the path , taking the sum of the weight contributions of all the possibilities for that row .",
    "the subtlety here is that _ the contribution from the segment of the path corresponding to row @xmath32 is given by the weight of row @xmath32 in the modified catalan tableau_. this rule is well - defined since the modified catalan tableaux are in a weight - preserving bijection with the catalan paths . in figure [ modified_contributions ] we see an example of the weight contributions that arise from each row segment of a catalan path .",
