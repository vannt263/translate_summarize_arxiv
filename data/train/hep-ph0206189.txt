    "the existence of a large momentum or mass scale is the basis of any perturbative treatment of hadronic processes . in photoproduction of heavy quarkonia",
    "there are two obvious scales : on the one hand the heavy quark mass and , on the other hand , the ( transverse ) momentum transfer .",
    "if one considers @xmath0 production the charm - quark mass is still too small to really serve as a hard scale .",
    "it is therefore likely that significant contributions come from non - perturbative regions in which hadronic fluctuations of the photon have a large transverse size .",
    "this statement is supported by the success of pomeron phenomenology in describing diffractive photoproduction of @xmath0s  @xcite .",
    "taking , on the other hand , the momentum transfer as a large scale one can think of several perturbative mechanisms . a potential mechanism at intermediate momentum transfers",
    "is depicted in fig .",
    "[ overlap ] . only one protonic constituent , a gluon , participates in the hard - scattering subprocess .",
    "a generalized gluon distribution describes the emission and reabsorption of the gluon .",
    "such a kind of mechanism has been considered by huang and kroll for the photoproduction of light mesons  @xcite .",
    "they , however , found a strong suppression of this production mechanism and concluded that vector - meson dominance is still at work at moderately large momentum transfers where data exist .     within the diquark model.,width=294 ]     within the diquark model.,width=294 ]    for asymptotically large momentum transfers it is generally assumed that the hard - scattering mechanism dominates  @xcite .",
    "the hard - scattering mechanism involves only valence fock states of the hadrons with the ( leading - order ) perturbative part being a coherent sum of tree graphs specific to the reaction under consideration .",
    "the non - perturbative ingredients of the hard - scattering mechanism are hadron distribution amplitudes , i.e. probability amplitudes for finding the hadronic constituents carrying certain fractions of their parent hadron s momentum .",
    "this is the reaction mechanism we concentrate on in our investigation of @xmath0 photoproduction . as the graph in fig .",
    "[ hsm ] shows , we assume in addition that the valence fock state of the proton is a quark - diquark rather than a three - quark state .",
    "this does not only simplify calculations , but diquarks also serve to model non - perturbative effects so that the hard - scattering mechanism may become applicable at reasonably large momentum transfers where data are available or can be expected .",
    "we take into account scalar and vector diquarks and treat them as extended particles with form factors at the gauge - boson diquark vertices . for the present analysis",
    "the form - factor parameters and also the quark - diquark distribution amplitude of the proton are adopted from previous work on baryon form factors , compton scattering and other reactions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the distribution amplitude for the @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath2 $ ] , is taken from ref .",
    "its normalization is fixed by the experimentally known @xmath0 decay constant .",
    "these are almost all the ingredients necessary for calculating the @xmath0-photoproduction amplitude .",
    "at this point it is necessary to mention that constituent masses are usually neglected in the calculation of the perturbative part of the amplitude as long as they do not fix the energy or momentum - transfer scale ( like in quarkonium decays ) .",
    "if we want to make predictions for momentum transfers which may become experimentally accessible in the near future , i.e. values not much larger than the charm - quark mass @xmath3 , we have to think about taking into account @xmath3 in the perturbative amplitude . following a common practice",
    "we assume that the 4-momentum of every hadronic constituent is proportional to the 4-momentum of its parent hadron .",
    "this implies that every constituent of hadron @xmath4 has an effective mass @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the fraction of the hadron s 4-momentum carried by the constituent . keeping in mind that the perturbative scattering amplitude for the constituents is convoluted with the hadron distribution amplitudes this implies , e.g. , that @xmath7 for our @xmath0 distribution amplitude , which is strongly peaked at @xmath8 .",
    "this prescription for constituent masses applies to ( on - shell ) particles which show up as external legs in the feynman diagrams . to obtain the constituent mass for an internal line",
    "we express the corresponding momentum as a sum of hadron momenta multiplied with the appropriate momentum fractions and replace the hadron momenta by their respective mass .",
    "if the resulting constituent mass contains a term @xmath9 this is neglected since it turns out that such terms violate @xmath10 gauge invariance . for our @xmath0 distribution amplitude the masses in",
    "the the charm - quark propagators become in this way again @xmath7 . the feynman diagrams",
    "are then calculated with these constituent masses and expressed in terms of the mandelstam variables @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "keeping the scattering angle fixed , we finally expand the perturbative amplitude in terms of @xmath15 and @xmath16 and neglect proton - mass corrections of order @xmath17 , @xmath18 , or higher .",
    "this kind of mass treatment has the nice feature that it preserves @xmath10 gauge invariance with respect to the photon and @xmath19 gauge invariance with respect to the gluon .",
    "a similar kind of mass treatment has already been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite for photoproduction of @xmath20 mesons . in that paper , however , massless mandelstam variables @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 have been used instead of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and the final mass expansion has not only been applied to the proton but also to the meson .",
    "at @xmath24  gev . data are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,width=287 ]      figures  [ jpsi60 ] and [ jpsi260 ] show the diquark - model predictions for @xmath25 $ ] for two hera energies along with recent zeus data .",
    "these data are only available at low momentum transfers ( @xmath26  gev@xmath27 ) , i.e. outside the validity range of the perturbative diquark model , so that a direct comparison with our predictions is not possible . compared with a naive extrapolation of the data our predictions , however ,",
    "seem to overshoot the @xmath0 photoproduction cross section in the few - gev momentum transfer region .",
    "the finite constituent masses provide two effects which are both sizable , but which partly compensate each other .",
    "for vanishing constituent masses only two of the twelve independent helicity amplitudes are different from zero , namely those for @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ jpsi60 ] ) . introducing constituent masses as described above and still taking only these two helicity amplitudes results in a considerable reduction of the cross section ( dashed line versus dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ jpsi60 ] ) . with finite constituent masses , however ,",
    "also the other helicity amplitudes become different from zero which increases the cross section again ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ jpsi60 ] ) .",
    "the overall effect of taking into account constituent masses is thus mainly a flattening of the cross section towards smaller momentum transfers .",
    "a further flattening and reduction of the cross section can be expected if one takes into account that the minimum momentum transfer @xmath30 in exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction is @xmath31  gev@xmath27 . in order to come to definite conclusions about the validity of the diquark model for @xmath0 photoproduction the corresponding modifications for the gluon kinematics certainly have to be investigated . nevertheless , it is interesting to notice that , in contrast to other exclusive reactions in which the leading - order perturbative calculation often underestimates the data , it rather seems to come out too large for @xmath0 photoproduction .",
    "this , at least , hints at the possibility that the perturbative production mechanism could provide a sizable contribution in exclusive @xmath0 photoproduction already at a few - gev of momentum transfer . it would therefore be interesting to have not only predictions from an effective model like ours , but also perturbative predictions on the more fundamental pure quark level . and",
    "finally it would , of course , also be highly desirable to get experimental cross - section data in the few - gev momentum - transfer region to compare with .",
