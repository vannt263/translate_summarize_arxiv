    "some remarks are necessary at this point .",
    "first , in the absence of the second kink at @xmath65 , the construction sketched above includes a change of sign of the temporal link at the border of the lattice and the periodic boundary conditions are made antiperiodic by the change of variables .",

    "as @xmath65 goes large , by cluster property @xmath88 finally , we stress that the result of our construction is mathematically identical to that of ref .",
    "@xmath48 , @xmath19 is a theorem .",
    "however for more complicated choices of the action , belonging to the same universality class , our construction , which only relies on symmetry , can be more practical for numerical approaches .",
    "this is similar to the situation for u(1 ) , where the construction of the dual is feasible for the villain form of the action , but the approach based on symmetry allows treatment of wilson and other forms of the action .    as a check of our arguments",
    "we shall compute the disorder parameter numerically , and use it to determine the critical indices of the model .",
    "let us try to extract information about the phase transition from the numerical study of the disorder parameter . to this purpose , at fixed @xmath64 in a finite lattice with periodic boundary conditions , we study @xmath89 as a function of @xmath90 by standard monte carlo methods .    by the cluster property , at large time separation",

    "this is a consequence of the form of @xmath93 in terms of the order variables @xcite .",
    "in fact @xmath93 is the ratio of two partition functions and the determination of the partition function of a system by numerical simulations is very difficult : @xmath70 is the exponential of a quantity fluctuating like the square root of the volume , so we expect for it fluctuations of order @xmath101 . because of these strong fluctuations the direct determination of @xmath93 by monte carlo techniques requires an amount of statistics which can not be obtained in realistic simulations .",
    "this difficulty can be overcome by defining another quantity whose fluctuations are proportional to the square root of the volume and which gives information about the behaviour of @xmath92 .",
    "to this goal we introduce the function @xcite @xmath102 in the limit @xmath103 @xmath104 which implies @xmath105 and the behaviour of @xmath92 can be reconstructed from the behaviour of @xmath106 in a simple way .    by using eq .",

    "we simulated both the standard and the kink action of the model by means of a heat - bath algorithm .",

    "far from criticality we collected about 100000 measurements for each @xmath22 by sampling each two sweeps ; near the critical coupling the statistics has been increased by a factor of 25 .    from the behaviour of @xmath92 in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", we expect that @xmath106 is nearly constant at low @xmath22 ( due to the slow variation of @xmath92 in this region ) , has a sharp negative peak in the critical region ( corresponding to the sudden decline of @xmath92 ) and approaches @xmath116 at weak coupling ( as a consequence of the restoring of the dual symmetry ) .",
    "the extrapolation of numerical results to the thermodynamic limit should give this behaviour for @xmath106 . a plot of @xmath106 data for the lattices we have investigated",

    "only modified links ( i.e. links whose sign has been changed ) contribute to @xmath118 , so we get @xmath119 where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are spins connected by a modified link @xmath122 and the sum is performed over all modified links .    in the limit @xmath123 the system",
    "is completely ordered , so all links are equal to 1 and the sum in eq .",
    "( [ dstrong ] ) simply reduces to the total number of modified links , i.e. @xmath124 indeed at high @xmath22 , @xmath92 goes to zero in the infinite volume limit , as required from the dual symmetry restoration .    from eq .",

    "[ isingstrong.fig ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath92 is nearly constant in this region and that feature seems to extrapolate to the thermodynamic limit . since at high temperature",
    "@xmath128 our data for @xmath106 imply that @xmath92 in the thermodynamic limit is different from zero in a wide range of @xmath22 s below @xmath127 .",
    "hence the behaviour of @xmath106 we obtained is compatible with dual symmetry breaking for @xmath96 .    in the critical region",
    "the approach to the thermodynamic limit is governed by finite size scaling theory , which states that at finite size @xmath113 in the critical region for @xmath19 , @xmath92 is given by @xmath129 with @xmath130 an unknown function of the scaling variable @xmath131 from eq .",

    "according to eq .  , all points should fall on one single curve .",

    "it is important to understand the range of validity of eq .  .",
    "on the one hand , in order for eq .   to be valid , the antikink should be placed at a large temporal distance from the kink .",
    "this means that @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the correlation length at a certain temperature .",
    "on the other hand , we want to be in the scaling region where finite size scaling is valid , so @xmath137 should not take very large values . in order to have an approximate idea , we computed the correlation length in a large @xmath138 lattice , @xmath139 , at the values of @xmath22 used to obtain fig .",

    "this fit is useful when only approximated values of @xmath127 and @xmath33 are known . in our case",
    "the solution of the model is known and the simple quality of the scaling is itself a good indication of the correctness of the approach .",
    "we note however that in order to obtain an accurate result for the critical exponents , one should not approach very much the critical point , where the correlation length diverges , in contrast with ordinary analyses .",
