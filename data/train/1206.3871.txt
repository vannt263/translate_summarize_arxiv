    "the s - process is responsible for creating about half of the elements heavier than iron that are observed in the solar system@xcite .",
    "this process involves the slow capture of neutrons ( slower than the average @xmath8-decay rate of unstable nuclei ) onto seed material , hence nucleosynthesis follows the nuclear valley of stability . by considering the solar system abundances of s - only nuclei ( that is , nuclei that can only be produced in the s - process )",
    "it can be shown that there are two key components of the s - process : the `` main '' component and the `` weak '' component  @xcite .",
    "the main component produces s - nuclei with masses of @xmath9 , while the weak component enriches the s - nuclei abundances at @xmath10 .",
    "the main component of the s - process arises from neutron captures during he - burning in @xmath11 asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( a detailed discussion of nuclear burning in agb stars can be found in refs .",

    "this burst of neutrons affects mainly the branchings in the s - process path . in intermediate - mass agb stars ( @xmath13 ) , where the temperatures are expected to be higher ,",
    "the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg reaction is thought to be the main source of neutrons and could explain the enhancement of rubidium seen in some metal poor agb stars @xcite .",
    "in addition to s - process elements , the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg and @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg rates influence the relative production of @xmath2 mg and @xmath7 mg , whose abundance ratios can be measured to high precision in circumstellar ( `` presolar '' ) dust grains .",
    "magnesium is also one of the few elements for which the isotopic ratios ( @xmath2mg/@xmath14 mg and @xmath7mg/@xmath14 mg can be derived from stellar spectra ( for example , refs .",

    "the weak component of the s - process arises from nuclear burning in massive stars .",
    "the core temperature in these stars ( typically with @xmath15 ) becomes high enough during he - burning for the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg reaction to produce a high flux of neutrons shortly before the helium fuel is exhausted .",
    "any remaining @xmath0ne releases a second flux of neutrons during convective carbon shell burning .",
    "the s - process yield in these stars is therefore sensitive to the temperature at which the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg reaction starts to produce an appreciable flux of neutrons .",
    "@xcite showed that the s - process during the core he - burning stage in massive stars depends strongly on both the @xmath0ne@xmath5 and the @xmath4o(n,@xmath6)@xmath16o reaction rates .",
    "they also found that not only are the overall uncertainties in the rates important , but also the temperature dependence of the rates .",

    "the species @xmath17fe is mainly produced in massive stars by neutron captures during convective shell carbon burning  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "its abundance , therefore , depends strongly on the @xmath0ne@xmath5 rates .",
    "the @xmath0ne@xmath5 rates also play a role in type ia supernovae . throughout the `` simmering '' stage , roughly 1000 years prior to the explosion , @xcite suggested that neutrons released by the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg reaction affect the carbon abundance , thus altering the amount of @xmath18ni produced ( i.e. , the peak luminosity ) in the explosion .",

    "the reaction rate per particle pair in a plasma of temperature , @xmath20 , is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the reduced mass of the reacting particles , @xmath23 ; @xmath24 denotes the masses of the particles ; @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant ; @xmath26 is the centre - of - mass energy of the reacting particles ; and @xmath27 is the reaction cross section at energy , @xmath26 .",
    "the strategy for determining reaction rates from eq.([eq : rates - reacrate ] ) depends on the nature of the cross section . in many cases",
    "the cross section can be separated into non - resonant and resonant parts .",
    "reactions such as @xmath0ne@xmath5 proceed through the compound nucleus @xmath7 mg at relatively high excitation energy ( @xmath28  kev  @xcite ) and are frequently dominated by resonant capture .",
    "the non - resonant part of the cross section will , therefore , be neglected in the following discussion .",
    "the reader is referred to refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite for more details .",
    "the resonant part of the cross - section can be represented in one of two ways : ( i ) by narrow resonances , whose partial widths can be assumed to be approximately constant over the resonance width ( `` narrow resonances '' ) , and ( ii ) by wide resonances , for which the resonant cross section must be integrated numerically to account for the energy dependence of the partial widths involved .",
    "the reaction rates per particle pair for single , isolated narrow and wide resonances , respectively , are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 where the resonance strength , @xmath31 is defined by @xmath32 @xmath33 is the resonance energy ; @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are the energy - dependent entrance channel ( particle ) partial width , exit channel partial width , and total width , respectively ; and @xmath37 , the statistical spin factor , is defined by @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the resonance and particle spins , respectively .",
    "the particle partial width , @xmath41 , can be written as the product of an energy - independent reduced width , @xmath42 , and an energy - dependent penetration factor , @xmath43 , as @xmath44 for the present case of @xmath0ne@xmath45 , the entrance channel ( @xmath1-particle ) reduced width , @xmath46 , is related to the @xmath1-particle spectroscopic factor , @xmath47 , by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the single - particle radial wave function at the channel radius , @xmath50  ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "the constant @xmath51 is the wigner limit ( in the notation of lane and thomas  @xcite ) .",

    "note that it is frequently assumed that @xmath53 , which must be regarded as a crude approximation only .",
    "for example , in the case of @xmath16o levels it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath47 exceeds @xmath54 by at most a factor of 2 .",
    "we will return to these issues in sec .",
    "[ sec : spectro - factors ] .",
    "the above relationships are useful since they allow for an estimation of the important @xmath1-particle partial widths from spectroscopic factors obtained in @xmath1-particle transfer reactions , as will be discussed later .",
    "it is important to note that the value of @xmath47 depends on the parameters of the nuclear potentials assumed in the transfer data analysis .",
    "similarly , the value of @xmath46 depends on the channel radius .",
    "however , if , throughout the analysis , consistent values of these parameters ( such as @xmath50 ) are used , their impact on the value of @xmath55 will be strongly reduced .",
    "the equations outlined in sec .  [ sec : rates - formalism ] provide the tools for calculating thermonuclear reaction rates given available estimates for the cross section parameters ( @xmath33 , @xmath56 , etc . ) .",
    "a problem arises , however , when statistically rigorous uncertainties of the reaction rates are desired .",
    "what is usually presented in the literature are recommended rates , together with upper and lower `` limits '' , but the reported values are not derived from a suitable probability density function . therefore , the reported values have no rigorous statistical meaning .",
    "an attempt to construct a method for analytical uncertainty propagation of reaction rates was made by @xcite .",
    "however , their method is applicable only in special cases , when the uncertainties in resonance parameters are relatively small . @xcite",
    "were also not able to treat the uncertainty propagation for reaction rates that need to be integrated or for rates that include upper limits on some parameters .",
    "for these reasons , a monte carlo method is used in the present study to calculate statistically meaningful reaction rates .",
    "the general strategy of monte carlo uncertainty propagation is as follows : ( i ) randomly sample from the probability density distribution of each input parameter ; ( ii ) calculate the reaction rates for each randomly sampled parameter set on a grid of temperatures ( using the same set at each temperature ) ; ( iii ) repeat steps ( i)-(ii ) many times ( on the order of 5000 ) .",
    "steps ( i)(iii ) will result in a distribution at each temperature grid point that can be interpreted as the probability density function of the reaction rate .",
    "extraction of uncertainties from this distribution will be discussed later .",
    "while input parameter sampling is being performed , care must be taken to consider correlations in parameters .",
    "for example , particle partial widths depend on the penetration factor , which is an energy dependent quantity .",
    "the individual energy samples must , therefore , be propagated consistently through resonance energy and partial width estimation in order to fully account for the correlation of these quantities .",
    "the code ` ratesmc`@xcite was used to perform the monte carlo sampling and to analyse the probability densities of the total reaction rates .    in order to apply monte carlo sampling to calculate reaction rate uncertainties ,",
    "sampling distributions must be chosen for each input parameter .",
    "once a reaction rate ( output ) distribution has been computed , an appropriate mathematical description must be found to present the result in a convenient manner .",
    "statistical distributions important for reaction rate calculations are described in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , and are summarised briefly below .",
    "uncertainties of resonance energies are determined by the _ sum _ of different contributions . in this case , the central limit theorem of statistics predicts that resonance energies are gaussian distributed .",
    "note that there is a finite probability of calculating a negative resonance energy and that this choice of probability density naturally accounts for the inclusion of sub - threshold resonances in the above formalism . a resonance strength or a partial width , on the other hand",
    ", is experimentally derived from the _ product _ of measured input quantities ( e.g. , count rates , stopping powers , detection efficiencies , etc . ) .",
    "in such a case the central limit theorem predicts that resonance strengths or partial widths are lognormally distributed .    the lognormal probability density for a resonance strength or a partial width is given by @xmath57 with the lognormal parameters @xmath22 and @xmath58 representing the mean and standard deviation of @xmath59 .",
    "these quantities are related to the expectation value , @xmath60 $ ] , and variance , @xmath61 $ ] , by @xmath62 ) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(1+\\frac{v[x]}{e[x]^2}\\right ) ,    \\quad \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\ln\\left(1+\\frac{v[x]}{e[x]^2}\\right)}\\ ] ] the quantities , @xmath63)$ ] and @xmath64 $ ] can be associated with the central value and uncertainty , respectively , that are commonly reported .",
    "note that a lognormal distribution is only defined for positive values of @xmath65 .",
    "this feature is crucial because it removes the finite probability of sampling unphysical , negative values when gaussian uncertainties are used .",
    "this is especially true for partial width measurements , which frequently have uncertainties in the 20 - 50% range .",
    "note , also , that a 50% gaussian uncertainty results in a 3% probability of the partial width having a value below zero .    the important problem of estimating reaction rates when only upper limits of resonance strengths or partial widths are available will now be discussed .",
    "the standard practise in nuclear astrophysics  ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is to adopt 10% resonance strength upper limit values for the calculation of the _ recommended _ total rates . ``",
    "lower limits '' or `` upper limits '' of rates are then derived by completely excluding or by adopting the full upper limit , respectively , for all resonance strengths .",
    "this procedure is questionable for two reasons .",
    "first , without further knowledge , it is implicitly assumed that the probability density for the resonance strength is a uniform distribution extending from zero to the upper limit value .",
    "the implication is that the _ mean value _ of the resonance strength amounts to half of its upper limit value .",
    "this conclusion contradicts fundamental nuclear physics , as will be explained below .",
    "second , the derived `` upper limit '' and `` lower limit '' on the total reaction rate are usually interpreted as sharp boundaries .",
    "this conclusion is also unphysical , as will be explained below .",
    "the strength of a resonance depends on particle partial widths , which can be expressed in terms of reduced widths , @xmath66 , or , alternatively , spectroscopic factors , @xmath67 ( see section  [ sec : rates - formalism ] ) .",
    "these quantities depend on the overlap between the incoming channel ( @xmath68 ) and the compound nucleus final state , which in turn depends on a nuclear matrix element .",
    "if the nuclear matrix element has contributions from many different parts of configuration space , and if the signs of these contributions are random , then the central limit theorem predicts that the probability density of the transition amplitude will tend toward a gaussian distribution centred at zero .",
    "the probability density of the reduced width , representing the _ square _ of the amplitude , is then given by a chi - squared distribution with one degree of freedom .",
    "these arguments were first presented by @xcite and this probability density is also known as the porter - thomas distribution . for a particle channel",
    "it can be written as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a normalisation constant , @xmath71 is the dimensionless reduced width , and @xmath72 is the local mean value of the dimensionless reduced width .",
    "the distribution implies that the reduced width for a given nucleus and set of quantum numbers varies by several orders of magnitude , with a higher probability the smaller the value of the reduced width .",
    "the porter - thomas distribution emerges naturally from the gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrix theory and is well established experimentally ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) ) by @xcite and a re - analysis of the nuclear data ensemble ( @xmath73 ) in ref . @xcite",
    "have claimed that the data are not well described by a @xmath74 distribution with one degree of freedom ( @xmath75 , i.e. , a porter - thomas distribution ) .",
    "they find , depending on the data set under consideration , values between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "these new results are controversial and more studies are needed before the issue can be settled .",
    "it is not clear at present if this controversy has any implications for the compound nucleus @xmath7 mg . ] .",
    "the above discussion provides a physically sound method for randomly sampling reduced widths ( or spectroscopic factors ) if only an upper limit value is available .",
    "furthermore , in the present work we assume a sharp truncation of the porter - thomas distribution at the upper limit value for the dimensionless reduced width , @xmath78 , that is , we randomly sample over the probability density @xmath79 once dimensionless reduced widths are obtained from sampling according to equation  ( [ eq : rates - portthom ] ) , samples of particle partial widths can be found from equation  ( [ eq : rates - gammadefinition ] ) .",
    "subsequently , samples of resonance strengths can be determined from equation  ( [ eq : rates - resstrength ] ) .    in order to utilise equation  ( [ eq : rates - portthom ] ) for monte carlo sampling of @xmath1-particle partial widths",
    ", the mean value of the dimensionless reduced width , @xmath80 , must be known . to this end",
    "we considered 360 @xmath1-particle reduced widths in the a=20 - 40 mass region ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "the distribution is shown in figure  [ fig : specfacts ] as a black histogram .",
    "binning and fitting the data to equation  ( [ eq : pt ] ) ( solid line ) results in a best - fit value of @xmath81 , which we adopt in the present work .",
    "it is important to recall the above arguments : the distribution of reduced widths for a given nucleus , given orbital angular momentum , given channel spin , etc .",
    ", is expected to follow a porter - thomas distribution . however , because of the relatively small sample size of 360 values , we were compelled to fit the entire set by disregarding differences in nuclear mass number and orbital angular momentum . for this reason",
    ", our derived mean value of 0.010 must be regarded as preliminary .",
    "more reliable estimates of @xmath80 have to await the analysis of a significantly larger data set of @xmath1-particle reduced widths when it becomes available in the future .    from the arguments presented above it",
    "should also be clear that the porter - thomas distribution is not expected to represent the reduced width of all nuclear levels , particularly if the amplitude is dominated by a few large contributions of configuration space .",
    "the most important example for the latter situation are @xmath1-cluster states , which are expected to have relatively large reduced widths .",
    "indeed , the large reduced width values in figure  [ fig : specfacts ] that are not described by the porter - thomas distribution ( solid line ) originate most likely from @xmath1-cluster states .",
    "clearly , the nuclear structure of a level in question must be considered carefully .",
    "for this reason , results from @xmath1-particle transfer studies are very important .",
    "it can be argued that these measurements populate preferentially @xmath1-cluster states , with large reduced widths ( or spectroscopic factors ) , while levels not populated in @xmath1-transfer have small reduced widths and , therefore , are more likely statistical in nature ( i.e. , described by a porter - thomas distribution ) .",
    "this issue will become important in later sections .",
    "once a random sampling of all input parameters has been performed , an ensemble of reaction rates is obtained . from its probability density",
    "one can extract descriptive statistics ( mean , median , variance etc . ) .",
    "for the recommended reaction rate , we adopt the median value .",
    "the median is a useful statistic because exactly half of the calculated rates lie above this value and half below .",
    "note that we do not use the mean value because it is strongly affected by outliers in the reaction rate distribution .",
    "the low and high reaction rates are obtained by assuming a 68% coverage probability .",
    "there are several methods for obtaining these coverage probabilities , such as finding the coverage that minimises the range of the uncertainties , or one that is centred on the median . in the present work ,",
    "the @xmath82 to 84@xmath83 percentiles of the cumulative reaction rate distribution are used .",
    "we emphasise an important point regarding reaction rate uncertainties : contrary to previous work , our `` low '' and `` high '' rates do not represent sharp boundaries ( i.e. , a probability density of zero outside the boundaries ) . as with any other continuous probability density function , these values depend on the assumed coverage probability , i.e. , assuming a larger coverage will result in a larger uncertainty of the total reaction rate ( this is further illustrated in figs .  [",
    "fig : uncerts_ag ] and  [ fig : uncerts_an ] ) .",
    "the important point here is that the monte carlo sampling results in `` low '' and `` high '' rates for which the coverage probability can be quantified precisely .",
    "although a low , high and median rate are useful quantities , they do not necessarily contain all the information on the rate probability density .",
    "for application of a reaction rate to nucleosynthesis calculations , therefore , it is useful to approximate the rate probability density by a simple analytical approximation .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that in most ( but not all ) cases the reaction rate probability density is well approximated by a lognormal distribution ( equation  [ eq : rates - lognormal ] ) .",
    "the lognormal parameters @xmath22 and @xmath58 can be found from the sampled total rates at each temperature according to @xmath84,\\qquad \\sigma^2 = v[\\ln(y)]\\ ] ] where @xmath85 $ ] and @xmath86 $ ] denote the expectation value and variance of the natural logarithm of the total rate , @xmath87 , respectively . a useful measure of the applicability of a lognormal approximation to the actual sampled distribution is provided by the anderson - darling statistic statistic because it does not require binning of the data .",
    "the latter usually results in a loss of information . ] , which is calculated from @xmath88\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the number of samples , @xmath90 are the sampled reaction rates at a given temperature ( arranged in ascending order ) , and @xmath91 is the cumulative distribution of a standard normal function ( i.e. , a gaussian centred at zero ) .",
    "an a - d value greater than unity indicates a deviation from a lognormal distribution .",
    "however , it was found by @xcite that the rate distribution does not _",
    "visibly _ deviate from lognormal until a - d exceeds @xmath92 .",
    "the a - d statistic is presented in tabs .",
    "[ tab : agrate ] and  [ tab : anrate ] along with the reaction rates at each temperature in order to provide a reference to the reader .",
    "experimental rates usually need to be extrapolated to high temperatures with the aid of theoretical models because resonances are only measured up to some finite energy , @xmath93 .",
    "if the effective stellar burning energy window  @xcite extends above this energy , the rate calculated using the procedure outlined above will become inaccurate .",
    "statistical nuclear reaction models must , therefore , be used to extrapolate the experimental rates beyond this temperature . the method used here",
    "is described in detail in ref .",

    "@xcite , by factors of 2 - 100 .",
    "the differences are caused by : ( i ) a different treatment of partial widths ; in ref .",
    "@xcite the rates were found from numerical integration by assuming upper limit values ( @xmath112  kev ) for the total widths , whereas in the present work total widths have been adopted from measured values ; ( ii ) our improved treatment of upper limits for reduced @xmath1-particle widths ( i.e. , sampling over a porter - thomas distribution ; see section  [ sec : rates - montecarlo ] ) ; and ( iii ) the fact that new nuclear data became available since 1999 ( see tab .  [",
    "tab : data - since - nacre ] ) .",
    "the combined effect of these improvements results in a factor of 5 reduction in reaction rate uncertainties in the he - burning temperature region .    as already noted in section  [ sec : general - aspects ] , a number of excited states near the @xmath1-particle and neutron thresholds in @xmath7 mg have been observed by additional inelastic proton scattering experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , their spins and parities have not been determined .",
    "in particular , it is not known at present if these levels possess natural parity and thereby may be populated in the @xmath0ne@xmath5 reactions . in order to investigate the maximum impact of these states with unknown @xmath113 values on the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg reaction rate , we performed a test by assuming that all of these levels possess natural parity and by adopting upper limit @xmath1-particle spectroscopic factors from that data of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results show that these states can increase the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg reaction rate by up to a factor of 30 at temperatures between t@xmath114 and @xmath115  gk .    for the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg reaction",
    "there is better agreement between previous and new rates .",
    "the present rates are slightly higher ( up to a factor of 2 ) than those calculated by ref .",
    "the two main reasons for the difference are : ( i ) we used inflated weighted averages of the reported resonance strengths from different measurements ( see section  [ sec : resonance - strengths ] ) ; and ( ii ) excluded the contribution of a presumed @xmath107  kev resonance , because the level at @xmath116  kev has been shown to possess unnatural parity  @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasise that the observed ( @xmath1,n ) and ( @xmath1,@xmath6 ) resonances near @xmath117  kev introduce another systematic uncertainty that we have not accounted for .",
    "recall that we treated these two resonances as independent and narrow ( section  [ sec : levels ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if they correspond to the same level in @xmath7 mg , the partial widths could be derived from the measured resonance strengths . in that case",
    ", the resonance turns out to be relatively broad , resulting in a significant contribution of the resonance tail to the total reaction rate .",
    "tests show that the resulting reaction rates near @xmath118  gk could increase by roughly a factor of 5 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg to @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg reaction rates is shown in figure  [ fig : rateratio ] .",
    "note that these rates are not independent since , for example , the same values of @xmath1-particle partial widths enter in both rate calculations if an @xmath119 and @xmath120 resonance corresponds to the same @xmath7 mg level .",
    "thus the uncertainties shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : rateratio ] are somewhat overestimated .",
    "nevertheless , it is instructive to compare the present ratios , shown in black , to those from previous work @xcite , displayed in red .",
    "it can be seen that the present ratio is significantly larger than previous results and , consequently , we predict that more neutrons will be produced per captured @xmath1-particle .",
    "in order to explore how the current @xmath0ne@xmath5 reaction rates affect s - process nucleosynthesis , two kind of calculations are presented here .",
    "the first compares final abundance yields from post - processing models upon changing the _ recommended _",
    "@xmath0ne@xmath5 reaction rates from previously published results to those presented in this paper .",
    "the second calculation estimates the variations in s - process nucleosynthesis arising from _ uncertainties _ in the present @xmath0ne@xmath5 reaction rates .",
    "these can then be compared with abundance variations arising from the literature rates .    in order to take the uncertainties into account , three sets of calculations",
    "were performed : ( i ) recommended rates for both @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg and @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg reactions , ( ii ) low @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg rate and high @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg rate , and ( iii ) high @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg rate and low @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg rate .",
    "although in reality the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg and @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg rates will be correlated , it is difficult to account for these correlations since the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg rate includes resonances below the neutron threshold and since some @xmath7 mg levels contribute more to one reaction channel than the other .",
    "for these reasons , we have chosen in the present study to explore conservatively the impact of the largest reaction rate variations .",
    "these nucleosynthesis calculations are performed separately for massive stars and agb stars .",
    "a single zone temperature - density profile has been used to study the effects of the @xmath0ne@xmath5 reaction rates on nucleosynthesis during the core helium burning stage in massive stars .",
    "the temperature - density profile and initial abundances used in the present study are for a @xmath121 star and have been used previously in refs .",
    "the most abundant isotopes at the onset of helium burning are ( in mass fractions , @xmath122 ) : @xmath123he ( @xmath124 ) , @xmath109n ( @xmath125 ) , @xmath126ne ( @xmath127 ) , and @xmath17fe ( @xmath128 ) . during most of the core helium burning phase , the temperature and density ( @xmath129  mk and @xmath130  g@xmath131@xmath132 ,",
    "respectively ) are not high enough for the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg neutron source to produce a significant number of neutrons . however , towards the end of this phase the temperatures become high enough for efficient neutron production .",
    "the exact time at which the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg reaction starts to occur not only affects the number of neutrons produced during core helium burning , but also the amount of @xmath0ne remaining that can be processed later during the carbon shell burning phase . although not studied here , the s - process is also expected to be active during shell carbon burning .    the nucleosynthesis study was performed with a 583 nucleus s - process network that extends up to molybdenum .",
    "reaction rates ( other than the @xmath0ne@xmath5 rates ) were adopted from the ` starlib ` library @xcite .",
    "the ` starlib ` library incorporates a compilation of recently evaluated experimental monte carlo reaction rates in tabular format on a grid of 60 temperatures from 1  mk to 10  gk .",
    "tabulated are the temperature , the reaction rate , and the factor uncertainty , which is closely related to the lognormal parameter , @xmath58 , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the agb nucleosynthesis tests are performed on a 5.5@xmath133 , @xmath134 model star , detailed in ref .",
    "this model was chosen because it experiences many thermal pulses ( 77 in total ) during the agb phase , where 69 of those he - shell instabilities reach peak temperatures of 0.30  gk or higher ( with temperatures of 0.35  gk for 50 thermal pulses ) .",
    "one complication arises from disentangling the effects of the @xmath0ne@xmath5 rates and those of proton - capture nucleosynthesis at the base of the convective envelope ( hot bottom burning , hbb ) . in our model ,",
    "the base of the envelope reaches peak temperatures of 98 mk , easily hot enough for activation of the nene and mgal proton - burning chains .",
    "the main results were reductions in the envelope @xmath14 mg and @xmath2 mg abundances , and increases in @xmath7 mg , @xmath7al , and @xmath135al .",
    "this means that the he - intershell preceding a pulse contains a non - solar mg isotopic composition that is enriched in @xmath7 mg .",
    "the post - processing nucleosynthesis used for the agb star models has previously been described in detail by ref.(e.g .",
    "this code needs as input from the stellar evolution code variables such as temperature , density , and convective boundaries as a function of time and mass fraction .",
    "the code then traces the abundance changes as a function of mass and time using a nuclear network containing 172 species ( from neutrons to sulphur , and then from iron to molybdenum ) and assuming time - dependent diffusive mixing for all convective zones @xcite .",
    "although this network does not contain species of the main s - process above a @xmath136 , their production is estimated by the inclusion of an extra isotope ( the `` g particle '' , counting neutron captures beyond our network ) .",
    "the reaction rates used in the nuclear network are mostly taken from the jina ` reaclib ` database @xcite , with the exception of the @xmath0ne@xmath5 rates adopted from the present work .",
    "some modifications were made to the jina ` reaclib ` library including the removal of the @xmath137zr decay rate ( since this is an essentially stable isotope with a half - life of @xmath138 years ) , and the inclusion of the ground and isomeric states in @xmath139kr .",
    "this is done because 50% of the neutron flux from @xmath140 @xmath141kr proceeds to the ground state of @xmath139kr ( @xmath142 days ) and the other 50% goes to the isomeric state ( @xmath143 hours ) .",
    "the inclusion of both @xmath139kr states is essential for rb abundance predictions in agb nucleosynthesis models ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effects of our new rates on the nucleosynthesis in comparison to using the results obtained in the literature are shown in fig.[fig : abundancechange - both ] .",
    "the improvements in abundance predictions for the two stellar environments are shown in fig.[fig : uncertainties - both ] .",
    "the most up - to - date previously published rates for the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg and @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg reactions are from refs .  @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the effects are markedly different for the two s - process environments , hence they will be discussed separately in the following .",
    "the recommended @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg reaction rate has not changed significantly in the present analysis .",
    "consequently , we do not expect the final @xmath2 mg abundance to change .",
    "the final @xmath7 mg abundance , on the other hand , changes significantly by roughly a factor of three .",
    "the abundance changes in nuclei heavier than iron are smaller , with the largest abundance increases occurring near @xmath144ni .",
    "the increased destruction of isotopes already present in the star is also apparent for the p - nuclides @xmath145se , @xmath146kr , @xmath141sr , and @xmath147nb .",
    "these results indicate that with the reduced @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg rate , more neutrons are produced per @xmath0ne@xmath5 reaction . rather than extending the reach of the weak s - process component ( i.e. , synthesis of more massive nuclei )",
    ", this flux increase affects branchings in the s - process path close to the iron peak .",
    "a wider range of intermediate mass nuclei are therefore produced .",
    "fig.[fig : abundancechange - both ] also illustrates that the @xmath0ne@xmath5 rates not only affect the abundances of traditional s - process nuclides , but also the abundances of nuclei below the iron peak that act as poisons .",
    "an example is @xmath2 mg , which produces @xmath7 mg through the @xmath2mg(n,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg reaction . with a higher flux of available neutrons",
    ", this neutron poison reaction occurs more frequently , effectively lessening the impact of the increased neutron flux on s - process nucleosynthesis .",
    "uncertainties in s - process nucleosynthesis in massive stars arising from uncertainties in the @xmath0ne@xmath5 reaction rates are shown in fig.[fig : uncertainties - both ] , where the thin ( red ) bars show uncertainties arising from the old rates , and thicker ( black ) bars show those from the new rates .",
    "in particular , large reductions are noticeable for @xmath7 mg , where the current yield uncertainty amounts to around 50% in contrast to the previous factor of 5 .",
    "uncertainties in weak s - process nucleosynthesis have also undergone significant improvements , especially for species that can only be destroyed , but not created , by neutron captures .",
    "an example of this is the nucleus @xmath148ni whose yield uncertainty has been reduced from a factor of five to just 50% .",
    "it is important to note here that , although the monte - carlo reaction rates do take into account systematic uncertainties , it is difficult to account for ambiguities in the data , for example , the open question of whether or not the @xmath117  kev resonance is a doublet . clearly , more measurements are needed .",
    "nucleosynthesis yields from our low metallicity agb star models show a very different pattern to those of the massive star study . for agb stars ,",
    "the effect on lighter elements is reduced in comparison to massive stars , with higher mass s - process elements revealing the largest changes .",
    "this weighting toward higher mass s - process elements is caused by our choice of using a low metallicity model . at low metallicity ,",
    "the neutron / fe seed ratio is much higher meaning that there is a higher production of higher atomic mass nuclei ( e.g. , see discussion in refs .",
    "nuclei towards the upper end of our network are produced up to a factor of 2 more than before , with the ` g ' particle representing nuclei beyond our network capturing over 70% more neutrons . in low metallicity agb stars , therefore , the @xmath0ne@xmath5 reactions can be expected to produce more high - mass s - process elements , while leaving the low - mass s - process below @xmath149 largely unaffected .",
    "uncertainties in s - process nucleosynthesis have been , as in massive stars , dramatically improved with our new rates .",
    "the previous abundance uncertainties were approximately a factor of 10 , while the present uncertainties amount to less than a factor of 2 .",
    "the present uncertainties in the rates affect the lower masses from a@xmath15025 to a@xmath15035 more than the s - process abundances .",
    "the ratio of @xmath7 mg and @xmath2 mg is still uncertain by approximately 20% , whereas it was previously around 80% ( note that ref .",
    "@xcite found @xmath7mg/@xmath2 mg ratio uncertainties of 60% ) .",
    "rubidium and zirconium isotopes have undergone yield uncertainty improvements by a factor of about two . for the s - nuclide @xmath137mo",
    ", the uncertainty has been reduced from a factor of 4 to a factor of 2 with our present results .",
    "the new @xmath0ne@xmath5 reaction rates presented here should also be tested with low - mass agb star models ( @xmath151 ) . in lower mass agb stars , while the @xmath3c(@xmath1,n)@xmath4o reaction is the main neutron source active between thermal pulses , activation of the @xmath0ne@xmath5 reactions during a convective thermal pulse can have a significant effect on branchings in the s - process path .",
    "both the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg and the @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg reactions influence the neutron flux available to the s - process in massive stars and agb stars . uncertainties in the rates ,",
    "therefore , lead to large uncertainties in s - process nucleosynthesis . in this paper , we have estimated greatly improved @xmath0ne@xmath5 reaction rates , based on newly available experimental information published since the works of refs.@xcite and @xcite , and by applying a sophisticated rate computational method  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we explored the astrophysical consequences for massive stars and for agb stars .    in massive stars ,",
    "simple one zone models of core helium - burning were utilised to determine the influence of the new rates on the weak component of the s - process .",
    "the most important result of our study is a significant reduction of nucleosynthesis uncertainties .",
    "the yield uncertainty has been reduced by between a factor of 5 and 10 across the s - process mass region considered here ( a @xmath152 ) .",
    "for example , the yields of key isotopes , @xmath7 mg and @xmath153zn , have uncertainty reduction factors of about 5 and 10 , respectively . when comparing abundances obtained from our new recommended rates with those derived from previous recommended rates , the final yield of @xmath7 mg",
    "is found to have been reduced by roughly a factor of three , while s - process isotopes were affected only marginally .",
    "however , s - process nucleosynthesis is more concentrated around the iron peak when using the new reaction rates .",
    "this relative insensitivity to changes in neutron flux is partially caused by captures on the neutron poisons @xmath154c , @xmath4o , and @xmath2 mg , which are present in large quantities .    in our agb star models ,",
    "the final abundance uncertainties have also been improved significantly with the new rates , with reductions by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "the key rubidium and zirconium isotopes , for example , have undergone yield uncertainty improvements of roughly a factor of two .",
    "we have also found that s - process nucleosynthesis is more active when including the new @xmath0ne@xmath5 reaction rates . while only small changes are found in the low - mass s - process path ( @xmath155 ) , at higher masses production increases by up to a factor of 2 .",
    "this is especially evident by counting the number of captures at the end of our network , yielding an increase of over 70% .",
    "further calculations should be performed to study the effect of our new rates on lower mass agb stars , while paying special attention to their effects on branchings in the s - process path .",
    "the monte - carlo method used in the present study to calculate the @xmath0ne@xmath5 reaction rates has the distinct advantage of calculating the uncertainties in a robust and statistical meaningful manner .",
    "although our rates include some of the systematic uncertainties in the nuclear data , there are still open questions regarding the resonance properties that could affect the rates .",
    "clearly , the remaining ambiguities in the nuclear data for the @xmath0ne@xmath5 reaction rates need to be resolved .",
    "the discrepancies discussed here , by @xcite , and by @xcite , make it difficult to assign some @xmath7 mg levels to @xmath0ne@xmath5 resonances .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath111  kev resonance should be re - measured with high precision .",
    "more information should also be gathered on the structure of @xmath7 mg levels near the @xmath1-particle and neutron thresholds .",
    "indirect methods such as particle transfer measurements are useful here , since the coulomb barrier inhibits direct measurements .",

    "<S> the @xmath3c(@xmath1,n)@xmath4o reaction is the dominant source of neutrons operating during the interpulse period , with the @xmath0ne@xmath5 source affecting mainly the s - process branchings during a thermal pulse . </S>",
    "<S> rate uncertainties in the competing @xmath0ne(@xmath1,n)@xmath2 mg and @xmath0ne(@xmath1,@xmath6)@xmath7 mg reactions result in large variations of s - process nucleosynthesis . here </S>",
    "<S> , we present up - to - date and statistically rigorous @xmath0ne@xmath5 reaction rates using recent experimental results and monte carlo sampling . </S>",
    "<S> our new rates are used in post - processing nucleosynthesis calculations both for massive stars and agb stars . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the nucleosynthesis uncertainties arising from the new rates are dramatically reduced in comparison to previously published results , but several ambiguities in the present data must still be addressed . </S>",
    "<S> recommendations for further study to resolve these issues are provided . </S>"
