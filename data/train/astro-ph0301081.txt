    "in recent years there have been many infrared surveys of the chamaeleon i dark cloud @xcite .",
    "these surveys provide many new candidate pre - main sequence stars based on photometric criteria .",
    "these observations aim to detect the faintest and thus the least massive pre - main sequence stars and are , in most cases , sensitive enough to detect young stars with masses close or even below the h burning limit .",
    "a complete census of the stellar population in the cloud would provide better estimates of the mass distribution and the star - formation history of chamaeleon i. in particular , these surveys open the door to study the imf down to the substellar regime .",
    "the chamaeleon i cloud is especially adequate for these purposes since it is located nearby ( d @xmath0 160 pc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while also extending over moderate angular scales on the sky ( @xmath0 3 deg@xmath8 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite determined the imf of the cloud down to @xmath00.3 @xmath9 based on @xmath0 80 optically visible known members and found a good agreement with the miller - scalo model . @xcite",
    "intensively observed a small region ( 300 arcmin@xmath4 ) in the center of chamaeleon i dark cloud .",
    "this area contains 22 young stars , including 13 very low mass members with k @xmath0 1113.5 identified in h@xmath10 .",
    "they found that the imf for the central area of the chamaeleon i cloud was roughly flat ( in logarithmic mass units ) from @xmath0 1 @xmath2 down to @xmath0 0.03 @xmath2 .    in order to study the extended low - mass imf in the whole chamaeleon i , it is desirable to determine characteristics of the new candidate young stars such as spectral types .",
    "the near - infrared spectra combined with published pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks can also be used to derive stellar masses and ages . in this contribution we present near - infrared spectra of 46 of the brightest ( _ typically _ @xmath1 12 ) candidate young stellar objects selected from the surveys cited above .",
    "we chose the brightest objects in order to have reasonable completeness and to achieve good s / n ratios in 4-m class telescopes .",
    "in addition , we obtained near - infrared spectra of 63 previously known members of this cloud as well as other nearby southern star - forming regions such as lupus .",
    "we used these known young stellar objects as a spectral type calibration group .",
    "these known objects and the @xcite atlas allow us to identify spectroscopic features usually present in young stellar objects that support the pre - main sequence status of the new objects .",
    "we combine our data with published photometry and spectral types of other sources in the cloud to compile a list of 145 pre - main sequence stars in the chamaeleon i dark cloud and study the mass and age distributions .",
    "in  2 we describe the observations and data reduction . in ",
    "3 we present our analysis and results .",
    "we derive spectral types from the water vapor indexes which combined with published photometry allows us to place the stars in the hr diagram .",
    "we conclude with a brief summary in  4 .",
    "we carried out these observations on april 10  12 , 1999 with the eso ntt near - infrared spectrograph / imaging camera sofi ( son of isaac ) and on may 6  9 , 1999 with osiris ( ohio state infrared imager and spectrometer ) on the ctio blanco 4-m telescope .",
    "a few additional spectra were obtained on feb 27 28 , 2002 with this telescope and infrared camera .",
    "tables 1 and 2 list the targets observed .",
    "sofi has two low resolution grisms ( red and blue ) that roughly cover the @xmath11 bands on a hawaii hgcdte 1024@xmath51024 detector with a plate scale of 0.292@xmath12/pix .",
    "the blue grism covers the spectral region between 0.951.63 @xmath13 m and the red grism the region between 1.532.52 @xmath13 m .",
    "the corresponding spectral resolutions ( r @xmath14 @xmath15/@xmath16@xmath15 ) are 930 and 980 for a 0.6@xmath12 slit .",
    "we used a 1@xmath12 wide and 290@xmath12 long slit .",
    "osiris was used in the x - disp ( multi - order / cross - dispersed ) mode with the f/2.8 camera and a slit 30@xmath12 long and 1.2@xmath12 wide .",
    "this configuration gives r ( @xmath15/@xmath16@xmath15 ) @xmath0 1200 ( 2 pixels ) , while covering the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 bands simultaneously on a 1024 @xmath5 1024 hgcdte detector at a plate scale of 0.403@xmath12/pix .",
    "in particular , the x - disp mode uses a cross - dispersing grism that gives the @xmath11 spectral region in three adjacent orders , from 5th to 3rd .    the integration time and the number of exposures per target",
    "were chosen based on the brightness of the source and background contribution each night . in most cases we obtained two sets of 9 blue and red spectra of the same integration time with sofi .",
    "we repeated this sequence for objects fainter than @xmath20 13 .",
    "common integration times were 90180 sec for both grisms . the telescope was nodded 3060@xmath12 along the 290@xmath12 long slit between consecutive positions following the usual abba pattern .",
    "this procedure corresponds to the `` nod throw along slit '' scheme as described in the sofi users manual @xcite .",
    "with osiris we _ typically _ obtained seven images of identical integration time , with the telescope dithered by 7@xmath12 along the 30@xmath12 long slit .",
    "the individual integration times varied between 30 and 180 sec .",
    "for faint objects ( i.e. , @xmath21 12 ) we obtained two 180 sec sequences of seven spectra .",
    "in addition to the program sources we observed several atmospheric standards .",
    "we selected two groups of standards with similar airmass to our candidate sources and observed them ( every @xmath0 2 hours ) each night .",
    "these telluric stars comprise both late ( g3 - 5 ) and early ( o8 ) spectral types and were chosen from the lists available at both observing sites .",
    "we obtained multiple flat field images , with a dome screen , using incandescent lamps on and off .",
    "a xenon lamp , also taken on and off , each night provided the wavelength calibration for our sofi data . to determine the wavelength scale of the osiris spectra we used a henear lamp .    to reduce the data we used iraf .",
    "we subtracted one image from another ( using pairs of nodded observations ) to eliminate the background and sky contribution in first approximation .",
    "this subtraction automatically took care of dark current and bias level .",
    "we flat - fielded our data dividing by a normalized dome flat .",
    "we used the _ twodspec _ task apall to trace and extract the spectra along a 6 pixel wide aperture in the sofi data and 10 pixel in the osiris co - added images .",
    "in particular for osiris data we treated @xmath11 x - disp adjacent orders using the _ echelle _ package .",
    "a further sky subtraction was done by fitting a polynomial to the regions on either side of the aperture .",
    "a non linear low order fit to the lines in the xenon and henear lamps were used to wavelength calibrate the spectra .",
    "we removed telluric features from our data dividing each program star by the atmospheric standard spectrum .",
    "for the osiris data we used a g3 - 5 standard and both g3 - 5 and o8 stars for the sofi spectra .",
    "the telluric star differed from the science target by @xmath22 0.2 in airmass .",
    "we used the _ onedspec _ task splot to remove h i ( paschen and brackett ) lines from the spectra of the g3 - 5 and o8 stars , interpolating across each line .",
    "the division by the standard canceled out telluric features in the science spectrum reasonably well but introduced the inverse of the atmospheric standard in the corrected spectrum .",
    "we recovered the true spectral shape multiplying the resultant spectrum by a planck function at the temperature corresponding to the atmospheric star .",
    "we finally combined the @xmath11 x - disp orders for our osiris spectra and the blue and the red grism regions for each object observed with sofi and eliminated regions of deep atmospheric absorptions .",
    "we also trimmed out wavelengths 0.950.97 @xmath13 m from our sofi spectra due to edge effects .",
    "the useful spectral range provided by osiris is 12000 - 23500    while sofi covers from 9700 to 25300  . for the sofi spectra , as mentioned before , we obtained two sets of spectra corresponding to the g3 - 5 and o8 telluric stars that were essentially identical . in section 3.2",
    "we show the set of science spectra obtained applying the o8 standard as telluric corrector .",
    "we observed two groups of stars : a ) 46 candidate young stellar objects detected by several recent surveys of the cloud ; and b ) 63 previously known young stars ( 36 belonging to the chamaeleon i dark cloud and 27 located in other star - forming regions , such as lupus ) .",
    "three objects in the second group ( vw cha , sz 119 , and sz 124 ) were observed with both sofi and osiris .",

    "they found that , in general , the spectral shapes correlate with the spectral energy distribution class and that equivalent widths of absorption features decrease from the class iii to the class i sources , as a consequence of the increasing amount of circumstellar material .",
