    "various studies have suggested several candidate ground states for the magnetically disordered phase of the spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model : a variety of spin liquids @xcite and valence bond solids @xcite .",
    "experimentally , a lot of effort has been made to realize the material system of such geometrically frustrated antiferromagnet .",
    "the herbertsmithite @xcite zncu@xmath1(oh)@xmath5cl@xmath0 has the most ideal structure with uniform exchange couplings and shows no magnetic ordering down to much lower temperatures than the curie - weiss temperature . on the other hand , there may be several additional factors that would affect the nature of the ground state .",
    "for example , the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction and impurity spins may be present in the material .",
    "@xcite because of these complications , it has been difficult to pin down the true ground state of the system .",
    "these considerations also suggest that it is important to understand the effect of various perturbations to the ideal kagome lattice structure and magnetic anisotropies to identify the true ground state of the system .",

    "magnetic susceptibility and magnetization measurements show that it is a magnetically - disordered 2d spin - gapped system.@xcite as a model to describe the system , a spin-1/2 antiferrmagnetic heisenberg model was considered with four different exchange couplings due to its deformed structure , labeled by @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "the exchange coupling constants are estimated by fitting the thermodynamic data : @xmath8 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are quite similar in magnitude ( @xmath13200 k ) , while @xmath12 is about half of the others ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the size of the spin gap is estimated to be @xmath15=21 k.    the recent neutron scattering experiment in conjunction with a dimer series expansion study has shown that the ground state of rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 is indeed the valence bond solid ( vbs ) with a 12-site unit cell.@xcite the valence bonds are formed in the strongest interaction links with the coupling constant @xmath8 ( black line segments in fig .",

    "further , it turned out that the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions are not negligible in rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 as seen in the triplon dispersions . if there are only ( isotropic ) heisenberg interactions , the system has so(3 ) global spin rotation symmetry so that its triplon dispersions should be triply - degenerate . when there are ( anisotropic ) dm interactions , the degeneracy of triplon dispersions is lifted .",
    "it was observed in neutron scattering experiment that the triplon dispersions of rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 are only doubly - degenerate .",

    "the vbs state with a 12-site unit cell turned out to have lower energy than the vbs state with a 36-site unit cell , which was suggested for uniform kagome lattice antiferromagnet ( @xmath18 case ) , when @xmath19 is less than 0.97 within the bond operator mean - field theory .",
    "concerning rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 , the triplon dispersions were predicted as well .",
    "the predicted triplon energy bands are triply - degenerate due to the so(3 ) symmetry of the heisenberg hamiltonian and spin gap is found at the k point .",
    "however , the spin gap ( the minimum triplon gap ) was observed at @xmath4 point in the recent neutron scattering experiment.@xcite this presents another evidence for the importance of the dm interaction in rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 .    in this paper",
    ", we theoretically investigate the effect of the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction in the deformed kagome lattice antiferromanget via various methods .",
    "the model hamiltonian for the system consists of the heigenberg ( @xmath20 ) and dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( @xmath21 ) interactions between the nearest neighbors ; @xmath22 for the heisenberg interactions , we consider four different exchange couplings , @xmath14 , depending on the interaction link as shown in fig .",

    "the direction of @xmath23 is determined by the moriya s rule@xcite to be along the positive z - direction if the orientation from the site @xmath30 to @xmath6 in @xmath7 is clockwise in each triangle of the kagome lattice . in the lower right part of fig .",
    "[ fig : deformed_kagome_lattice ] , the orientations from @xmath30 to @xmath6 for the positive dm vector are denoted with arrows in two possible types of triangles in the kagome lattice .",
    "it must be noted that the model hamiltonian has so(2 ) global spin rotation symmetry in the xy - plane because every dm vector is along the z - direction .",
    "therefore , the generator of spin rotation in the xy - plane , @xmath31 , is a good quantum number of the hamiltonian .    to analyze this hamiltonian , we take three different approaches : bond operator mean - field theory , exact diagonalization , and strong coupling expansion .",
    "first , the bond operator mean - field theory is used to investigate the effect of the dm interaction on the triplon dispersions . within the bond operator theory",
    ", we consider the vbs state with the 12-site unit cell in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimer_configuration ] as the ground state and obtain the triplon dispersions .",
    "these disperions are shown to be consistent with the results of the neutron scattering experiment .",
    "the dispersions are twofold degenerate , which results from the so(2 ) symmetry of the hamiltonian . by increasing the strength of the dm interactions ( @xmath29 ) from zero , we observe that the position of the spin gap ( the minimum triplon gap ) in the first brillouin zone shifts from the k to @xmath4 point at @xmath32 . beyond @xmath32 ,",
    "the size of the spin gap decreases gradually , but the position of spin gap does not change from the k point .",
    "it is interesting to note that the spin gap is linearly decreasing as a function of @xmath29 after @xmath32 . by performing linear fitting",
    ", we estimate the critical value @xmath33 , at which the spin gap becomes zero .",
    "the value of @xmath29 in rb@xmath0cu@xmath1snf@xmath2 was estimated to be 0.18 in the series expansion study . at @xmath34 ,",
    "the spin gap in the bond operator theory is 0.464 @xmath8 .",
    "this value is about four times larger than the neutron scattering result , 0.126 @xmath8 .",
    "but , it is not surprising because the bond operator mean - filed theory tends to overestimate the spin gap .",
    "secondly , we conduct the exact diagonalization study for finite size clusters in order to calculate the spin gap more accurately . in the 24-site cluster",
    ", the spin gap is found to be 0.229 @xmath8 , which is not far from the experimental value . as a matter of fact",
    ", this value is the best among the results of various approaches in our study . via the exact diagonalization",
    ", we also study magnetization process because magnetically - disordered spin - gapped systems often show interesting behaviors in magnetization process .",
    "exact diagonalization is restricted to small size clusters due to the large unit cell of the deformed kagome lattice . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "we also employ strong coupling expansion approach .",
    "strong coupling expansion is a degenerate perturbation theory which provides an effective hamiltonian near the magnetic fields strong enough to close the spin gap .",
    "this approach allows the larger system sizes than the clusters used in the exact diagonalization study because the full hilbert space is projected into the subspace of the states relevant to the magnetization process . from the exact diagonalization and strong coupling expansion studies ,",
    "we obtain qualitatively the same magnetization curves .",
    "the magnetization curves increase continuously from zero to saturated magnetization as the magnetic field is increased , which is consistent with the magnetization measurement .",
