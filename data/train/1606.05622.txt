    "the euler problem of two fixed centers describes the motion of a point - mass under the influence of a newtonian potential with two fixed attracting points .",
    "we refer to the two attracting bodies as _ the earth _ and _ the moon _ and the point - mass as _ the satellite_. this problem can be obtained from the restricted three - body problem by ignoring the centrifugal and coriolis terms . that this system is completely integrable was discovered by euler in 1760 using the elliptic coordinates .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the mass ratio of the two massive bodies and locate the earth and the moon at @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the describing hamiltonian @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 without loss of generality we may assume that @xmath5 , i.e. , the earth is stronger .",
    "the hamiltonian has a unique critical point @xmath6 , @xmath7 , of morse index 1 .",
    "it corresponds to the saddle point of the potential .    for an energy @xmath8",
    ", we define _ the hill s region _ to be @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the projection along @xmath11 . in what follows ,",
    "we only consider negative energies .",
    "note that for a negative energy the hill s region is bounded , namely the satellite is confined to a bounded subset of the configuration space .",
    "we denote by @xmath12 the value @xmath13 and call it _ the critical jacobi energy_. for @xmath14 , the hill s region consists of two connected components , where one of them is a neighborhood of the earth and the other is a neighborhood of the moon .",
    "we denote them by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . for @xmath17 ,",
    "these two components become connected .",
    "the satellite then can move from the earth to the moon and vice versa .",
    "there are two further distinguished energy levels , which are denoted by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , at which the liouville foliation changes , see fig .",
    "[ diagram ] .",
    "the lower - half @xmath20-plane is divided into four regions ( if @xmath21 ) or three regions ( if @xmath22 ) by five critical curves , see fig .",
    "[ diagram ] . for points on these curves there exist the associated critical periodic orbits : the interior collision orbit , the exterior collision orbit , the double - collision orbit , the hyperbolic orbit and the elliptic orbit , see fig .",
    "[ motions ] .",
    "they are critical orbits , more precisely the differentials of the hamiltonian and the first integral are linearly dependent along these orbits and hence the corresponding leaves of the liouville foliation are singular .",
    "lyapunov @xcite showed that near each collinear lagrangian point of the restricted three - body problem there exists a family of unstable periodic orbits , which are called _ the lyapunov orbits_. the family of the lyapunov orbits converges uniformly to the corresponding lagrangian point as the energy goes to the associated critical energy from above . in the euler problem , the hyperbolic orbits form such a family , see sec .",
    "[ euler ] .",
    "we also call these orbits the lyapunov orbits . note that the hyperbolic orbit exists for each @xmath0 and for each @xmath23 .    a _ homoclinic orbit _ , whose concept was introduced by poincar , is an orbit which is asymptotic to an unstable periodic orbit in both forward and backward time . in view of the poincar section map",
    ", an unstable periodic orbit corresponds to a hyperbolic fixed point of this map and a homoclinic orbit is represented by a point whose orbit is doubly asymptotic to the the hyperbolic fixed point .    for the restricted three body problem ,",
    "conley @xcite showed that if the energy is sufficiently close to @xmath24 from above and if the mass ratio is sufficiently small , then homoclinic orbits exist in a neighborhood of the heavier mass , where @xmath25 is the first lagrangian point .",
    "mcgehee @xcite modified the conley s argument and proved that every homoclinic orbit rotates around the heavier mass in the same direction .",
    "note that conley and mcgehee used perturbative methods , which are applicable if the given system is close to a completely integrable system : if the second primary is sufficiently small , then the restricted three - body problem can be considered as a perturbation of the rotating kepler problem .    in the same paper",
    ", conley mentioned that his arguments also apply to the euler problem and since this problem is completely integrable , `` total degeneracy '' occurs which means that the unstable and stable manifolds of the lyapunov orbit coincide with each other .",
    "a direct consequence is the existence of homoclinic orbits near the earth in the euler problem for the case that the moon is sufficiently small , i.e. , @xmath26 is small enough , and the energy is close to the critical jacobi energy .",
    "the goal of this article is to extend the above result to the larger ranges of the energy and the mass ratio using a global method by means of integrability . in particular ,",
    "the same results hold for the moon component . by the definition of a homoclinic orbit , it lies on the intersection of the unstable and the stable manifolds of the lyapunov orbit . for the problem of the restricted three bodies ,",
    "llibre - martnez - sim @xcite proved analytically that under appropriate conditions the unstable and stable manifolds of the lyapunov orbit around the first lagrangian point intersect transversally . recall that the existence of a tranverse intersection of the invariant manifolds implies existence of smale - horseshoe chaos ,",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "however , this is not the case for the euler problem since the presence of a transverse intersection prevents the existence of any real analytic integral .",
    "instead , we prove the following theorem .",
    "[ thm : homo ] for any @xmath0 and for any @xmath23 , the unstable and stable manifolds of the lyapunov orbit coincide with each other . in particular , homoclinic orbits exist for any mass ratio and for any energy value at which the lyapunov orbit exists .",
    "moreover , each invariant manifold of the lyapunov orbit contains collision homoclinic orbits and all non - collision homoclinic orbits rotate one of the primaries exactly once .",
    "in particular , they can rotate in both directions .",
    "we remark that in the restricted three - body problem along homoclinic orbits collisions do not occur and every homoclinic orbit rotates in one direction because of the presence of the invariant torus and the rotating term in the hamiltonian , see @xcite .",
    "we now consider doubly - covered periodic orbits in the regularized system .",
    "we proceed the regularization via _ the doubly - covered elliptic coordinates _ as follows .",

    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we now fix an energy @xmath36 and define the regularized hamiltonian by @xmath37 where @xmath38 note that orbits of @xmath39 with energy @xmath8 and the time parameter @xmath40 correspond to orbits of @xmath41 with energy @xmath42 and the time parameter @xmath43 , which is defined by @xmath44 moreover , each bounded component of the energy hypersurface @xmath45 lifts to each compact component , which is diffeomorphic to @xmath46 , of the regularized hypersurface @xmath47 .",
    "thus , every doubly - covered periodic orbit now can be seen as a knot in @xmath46 .",
    "furthermore , by the arnold - liouville theorem , every regular orbit lies on a liouville torus . by the @xmath48-torus we mean the liouville torus whose rotation number is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 are relatively prime .",
    "our next result is :    [ thm : knot1 ] every doubly - covered periodic orbit on the @xmath48-torus in the regularized euler problem is a @xmath51-torus knot .    for more results on periodic orbits",
