    "vortex tunneling across narrow thin films is a quantum effect that limits superconductivity in these systems .",
    "it does not rely on any vortices preexisting in the sample ( due , e.g. , to temperature or a magnetic field ) but occurs as a result of quantum fluctuations  either a vortex entering the sample from the outside or a virtual vortex - antivortex pair created in the sample . a supercurrent ( if present )",
    "exerts a force on the vortex and , for certain types of vortex motion , the total work done by this force is nonzero .",
    "that means that an amount of energy is taken away from the supercurrent , i.e. , there is dissipation  an electrical resistance .",
    "frequently , one considers vortex tunneling at a strong enough current , so that the vortex can nucleate close to the boundary : the closer it nucleates , the shorter is the distance it has to tunnel , and the larger is the tunneling rate .",
    "however , for very narrow samples ( starting perhaps with a few tens of nm ) , the rate may remain substantial even at weak currents , when the vortex tunnels the entire width .",
    "this is the case we consider here , motivated in part by its similarity to quantum phase slips in a genuinely one - dimensional ( 1d ) wire , a topic of much current experimental research .",
    "while the core of a vortex can for our purposes be considered point - like , it is important to take into account the long - range disturbance that vortex motion produces .",
    "low - dimensional superconductors support a gapless plasmon mode , which in the presence of a nearby ground plate ( the case considered here ) has an acoustic dispersion law , with a speed @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to a new length scale , @xmath3 ( @xmath0 is the temperature ) , to which other length scales can be compared .",
    "in particular , one can distinguish between long wires , those of length @xmath4 , for which the final state of plasmons does not depend on the boundary conditions at the ends , and short ones , @xmath5 , for which it may .    for long 1d wires ,",
    "plasmon production has been shown theoretically to significantly affect the tunneling rate . in the presence of disorder",
    ", it leads to a power - law current - voltage dependence in the superconducting state at low temperatures,@xcite @xmath6 ( a state is superconducting if @xmath7 ) . here , we consider the opposite , short - wire , limit . , in which the short - wire condition is simply @xmath8 . ]",
    "this choice is motivated by a puzzle in the existing experimental results : while in a long wire the observed nonlinear @xmath9 curve is indeed well described by a power law , in short wires , no power law in current or in temperature has been detected .",
    "our results provide an explanation for that .    a general theory that allows one to compute the effect of plasmons on vortex tunneling for samples of various sizes",
    "can be constructed along the following lines . as well known ( and reviewed , for example , in ref . ) , two - dimensional superfluids have a dual description , in which vortices are viewed as charges and plasmons as `` photons '' , so that the theory maps onto planar quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) .",
    "we present a derivation of this , based on a path - integral identity , in sect .",
    "[ sect : dual ] .",
    "the version of qed that we use in this paper is `` quenched '' , in the sense that it considers only a single vortex and neglects interaction with additional vortices that may tunnel nearby .",
    "we expect this to be a good approximation as long as one stays away from a superconductor - insulator transition .",
    "( for 1d wires , a mean - field - type theory that takes into account interactions between quantum phase slips has been recently proposed in ref . . ) in the quenched limit , the computation of the plasmon action amounts essentially to a euclidean ( imaginary time ) version of the classical radiation theory .",
    "( the imaginary time appears since we are considering a tunneling process . )",
    "an important aspect of the theory is formulation of the boundary conditions at the ends of the sample .",
    "this is described in sect . [",
    "sect : rad ] , and the solution for the plasmon field is given in sect .",
    "[ sect : sol ] .",
    "our final result is that , in the superconducting state of narrow short wires connected to bulk superconducting leads , the resistance due to vortex tunneling , at small temperatures and currents , is no longer a power law but an exponential in @xmath1 .",
    "we trace this stronger suppression to a large gradient energy that the system must have already when it enters the classically forbidden region .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath1 in the exponent depends inversely on the length @xmath10 .",
    "we wish to reiterate that this result applies only in the superconducting state , where the tunneling events ( instantons ) are rare , and does not preclude the possibility of a transition to an insulating state at larger tunneling rates .",
    "the tunneling process we consider here is in addition to and competes with the classical , over - barrier process .",
    "the latter is an analog of a thermally activated phase slip in the 1d case.@xcite as we will see , despite the above - mentioned suppression , the rate of vortex tunneling is exponentially larger than the rate of thermal activation over a broad range of parameters .",
    "we hope that the difference in both the magnitudes of the resistance and its dependence on the length will allow one to distinguish between the two effects experimentally .",
    "we should also note the difference in the starting points for the theories of these two effects .",
    "the energy of the lamh saddle point@xcite is due to the phase slip core ( and consequently depends strongly on the ginzburg - landau coherence length @xmath11 ) .",
    "in contrast , in our case , the activation energy is that of the initial tunneling state , which lies far from the top of the potential barrier . depletion of the order parameter in this state is still small , and we can use the phase - only theory , in which vortex cores are essentially point - like .",
    "the lagrangian density of the phase - only theory that describes a superconducting film in the presence of a nearby ground plate is = ( _ t ) ^2 - k_s ( ) ^2 = k_s ^ _ .",
    "[ l ] in the second equality here we have switched to the notation of special relativity , by using instead of time @xmath12 the coordinate @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the plasmon speed .",
    "( in addition , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . ) in what follows , we choose units of length and time so that @xmath17 .",
    "greek indices take values @xmath18 , and summation over a repeated index is implied .",
    "the field @xmath19 is the phase of the order parameter , but no assumption is made about the existence of long - range order , i.e. , we do no require the expectation value of @xmath20 to be nonzero .",
    "all that is required for superfluidity is that the stiffness @xmath21 renormalizes to a nonzero value in the infrared .",
    "if @xmath19 were a single - valued smooth function of @xmath22 , plasmons would be the only excitations in the system , and the theory would be completely gaussian . to describe vortices ,",
    "we allow @xmath19 to be multivalued .",
    "alternatively , we could make it discontinuous by drawing explicit branch cuts at vortex positions , but we will be using the first approach . then , @xmath23 is smooth outside vortex cores",
    ".    the phase - only description ( [ l ] ) does not resolve vortex cores , so a short - scale cutoff of order of the ginzburg - landau coherence length @xmath11 is implied .",
    "let us remark on the issue of gauge invariance and the apparent absence of electromagnetic fields from ( [ l ] ) . in thin films , magnetic field of a vortex",
    "extends over a large area , determined by the transverse screening length @xmath24.@xcite if @xmath24 ( which in thin films can exceed 100 @xmath25 m ) is much larger than the smallest dimension of the film , the magnetic field can be neglected , and it is possible to choose a gauge such that the vector potential @xmath26 is close to zero . the remaining gauge freedom can be used to make the scalar potential @xmath27 go to zero away from the film .",
    "this fixes the gauge completely , and if @xmath19 denotes the phase in this gauge it is in effect gauge - invariant . integrating out @xmath27 produces a capacitive term , which eventually becomes the first term in ( [ l ] ) .",
    "we have not included in ( [ l ] ) a `` topological '' term , proportional to @xmath28 , that gives rise to the magnus force on a vortex .",
    "we consider films that have significant amounts of disorder , and in disordered superconductors the magnus force is small.@xcite    eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) allows one to describe dissipation of energy of vortex motion into plasmons , but does not include any dissipative mechanisms related to normal electrons at the vortex cores .",
    "this is justified in the limit of strong disorder , since transfer of energy to the normal component in this case is inhibited by the short electron mean - free path .    because in the presence of vortices @xmath19 is multivalued",

    ", they describe motion of an arbitrary number of real vortices in the presence of supercurrents and plasmon waves . in the euclidean ( imaginary time ) version , to which we turn shortly , solutions to the equations of motion will determine the most probable tunneling paths ( instantons ) responsible for the quantum decay of supercurrents .",

    "first , note that the path integral over @xmath37 enforces the bianchi identity ^ _ f _ = 0 .",
    "[ bianchi ] since in ( [ map ] ) @xmath33 is an independent variable and not ( yet ) a curl of some gauge field , ( [ bianchi ] ) is not really an identity but an independent equation of motion ; however , we keep the familiar term .",

    "i f(x,_i ) = + 4 _ n=1,3 ,  ( n /2 ) [ _ x f_0n(x ) + ( x - x ) ] .",
    "[ grad ] for low - frequency modes , those with @xmath162 , @xmath163 so the total contribution of these modes to ( [ grad ] ) is @xmath164 .",
    "then , the gradient energy contained in these modes is = k_s w _ 0^l ( _ x ) ^2_low dx , [ ene ] in precise accord with ( [ res ] ) .",
    "this means that the main effect suppressing resistance at low temperature is the population of the initial tunneling state , due to the large gradient of @xmath19 already required by that time .",
    "there is , of course , an additional action associated with the tunneling itself , but the precise agreement between ( [ res ] ) and ( [ ene ] ) implies that it is only subleading .",
    "we should note that the entirely classical appearance of the exponent in ( [ res ] ) ( it does not require any powers of @xmath165 ) does not contradict it being a consequence of tunneling , rather than a classical , over - barrier process .",
    "indeed , restoring @xmath165 and @xmath2 in the short - wire condition , under which ( [ res ] ) applies , we obtain @xmath166 , and this can not be realized outside of quantum mechanics .    for comparison ,",
    "let us list nucleation energies for two purely classical processes .",
    "the nucleation energy of a vortex is of order @xmath167 ( times a logarithm ) , and that of the @xmath47-independent saddle point , analogous to the lamh saddle point in 1d wires,@xcite is of order @xmath168 , where @xmath11 is the ginzburg - landau coherence length .",
    "as long as @xmath57 and @xmath11 are both much smaller than @xmath10 , either of these energies is larger than the energy ( [ ene ] ) .    due to a relatively large numerical factor ( @xmath169 ) in ( [ ene ] )",
    ", the condition @xmath170 , under which the energy ( [ ene ] ) is smaller than the lamh activation energy , may in fact mean that @xmath10 must be several times larger than @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , even if this condition is satisfied at low temperatures , it breaks down in a region close to the critical temperature @xmath171 .",
    "the short - wire condition also breaks down near in a region near @xmath171 , since @xmath21 and hence @xmath2 are small there ; in that region , subleading terms in the instanton action become non - negligible . outside of these regions",
    ", however , vortex tunneling is the dominant resistive process .    for a superconductor in the dirty limit , the exponent in ( [ res ] ) can be expressed entirely in terms of the superconducting gap @xmath172 and the normal - state resistance @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the sheet resistivity .",
    "indeed , in this case @xmath175 , so r(t ) ~ ( - ) , [ res2 ] where @xmath176 k@xmath177 .",
    "this suggests that the value @xmath178 may have a special significance in short wires .",
    "experimentally , it does : this is the value near which one observes a superconducting - insulating transition .",
    "we have described a general method for calculating the effect of plasmons on vortex tunneling in superconducting wires and applied it to the limit of small temperatures and currents , when the vortex has to tunnel the entire width of the wire .",
    "the method is based on a duality map , through which vortices become charges and plasmons become `` photons '' .",
    "we have found that , if plasmons can not easily leave the tunneling region , as is the case when the wire is short and the leads are bulk superconductors , the suppression of the resistance in the superconducting state is exponential at low temperatures and expressed by eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) .",
    "as the width of the sample is made smaller and approaches the coherence length @xmath11 , vortex tunneling crosses over to quantum phase slips in a genuinely 1d geometry .",
    "the restriction to modes independent of @xmath47 ( the transverse coordinate ) that we made in sect .",
    "[ sect : sol ] effectively brings us one dimension down , so we expect the 1d case to be similar to ours .    despite the exponential suppression , the resistance due to ( thermally - assisted ) vortex tunneling is larger , over a broad range of parameters , than that due to classical , over - barrier processes , such as motion of a thermally nucleated vortex - antivortex pair or a thermally - activated phase slip .",
    "in addition , it has a characteristic dependence on the length @xmath10 of the sample or , equivalently , on the total normal - state resistance @xmath179 , cf .",
    "( [ res2 ] ) .",
    "we hope that these features will allow one to distinguish between the quantum and classical processes in the experiment .",
