    "this approximation is based in part on the ease of calculating the inverse compton spectrum in a spherical geometry .",
    "this approach has served the subject well and has produced useful estimates of the parameters of many blazars @xcite . however , when we consider the reconciliation of constraints based upon spectral breaks and pair opacity , spherical models are probably too contrived .",
    "furthermore , consideration of the way in which shocked regions would arise in jets lead us away from the idea of spherical emitting regions . in this paper",
    "we take the first steps in the direction of determining the geometry of blazar emission and how this relates to the dynamics of the underlying flow .",

    "however , this idea has not really been developed significantly .",
    "in order to make further progress it is important to understand the possible processes that can lead to the production of shocks in jets .",
    "one process that is often mentioned ( e.g. ) is the production of shocks resulting from variations in the flow velocity .",
    "we idealise the initial conditions as a velocity discontinuity with faster moving gas catching up to slower moving gas ( see figure  [ f:2shock ] ) .",
    "this is a classic shock tube in which the equation of state and flow velocities are relativistic .",
    "there are two solutions of interest : ( 1 ) two shock waves are produced , one moving into the gas ahead of the shock  the forward shock , the other into the gas behind  the reverse shock .",
    "( 2 ) a single shock ( either forward or reverse ) and a rarefaction are produced .",
    "the direction of the shock in this case depends upon the details of the initial parameters .",
    "the development of the two possible solutions are sketched in figure  [ f : shock_tube ] .",
    "both of these situations are most readily analysed by transforming to the frame of the contact discontinuity separating the two gases .",
    "this is the approach used by for the non - relativistic case .",
    "it is also useful here since , as before , this is the rest frame of the two gases on either side of the contact discontinuity and is the appropriate frame in which to calculate the emissivity .      let us first consider the case of a forward and reverse shock .",
    "it is useful to calculate the difference in the velocities of the two shocks given the ( uniform ) pressure , @xmath39 , of the gas sandwiched in between them . in",
    "so doing we use the ultrarelativistic equation of state , @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the pressure and @xmath42 is the energy density .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that at this stage of the jet , some 100 gravitational radii from the core , there is no entrained thermal matter and that the initial matter ejected from the black hole is ultrarelativistic ( e.g. is composed exclusively of relativistic electron - positron pairs ) .",
    "the most straightforward way to do the calculation is in the frame of the contact discontinuity ( cd ) separating the two shocked regions , assign the ratio @xmath43 , and then use this to calculate velocities of both shocks and the velocities of upstream and downstream gas .    in the frame of the contact discontinuity",
    ", the velocities of upstream and downstream gas in regions 1 and 2 may be derived from the expressions given in for the relative velocity between pre - shock and post - shock gases , taking into account that in the cd frame the post - shock gas is stationary .",
    "the result is : @xmath44    at this point we introduce a convenient notation for the relativistic composition of velocities .",
    "we denote the relativistic addition and subtraction of velocities by @xmath45 respectively .",
    "the _ frame - independent _ relative velocity between the gas on either side of the forward / reverse shock structure @xmath46 may be used to either calculate the relative velocity in the observer s frame as a function of the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath47 or to numerically determine the ratio @xmath43 of the shock to upstream pressures as a function of the relative velocity and the ratio , @xmath47 of the downstream to upstream pressures .",
    "what is most important for the current purposes is the difference in the _ shock _ velocities since this determines the size of the emitting region in the rest frame .",
    "these may be calculated from the expressions given in for the pre - shock and post - shock velocities _ in the shock frame . _ denoting the shock frame by a double prime superscript , then the velocity of the reverse shock , for example , in the cd frame , is given by : @xmath48 the results for both forward and reverse shocks are : @xmath49 the limits of strong and weak shocks are informative .",

    "note also that the range in velocities between strong and weak shocks is not great  approximately @xmath51 .",
    "the shock velocity difference , which determines the size of the emitting region , is shown in figure  [ f : vsh_p3 ] .",
    "note that the size of the region is _ not _ determined by the relative velocity .",
    "however , the relative velocity has a role which we consider further below .",
    "the size of the flaring region in the rest frame as a function of the time in the rest frame , @xmath52 and the observer s time , @xmath36 , is given by : @xmath53 time dilation between the rest and observer s frame has been incorporated .",
    "since the difference in shock velocities does not vary greatly with the pressure of the shocked gas , we adopt a fiducial value of unity for that parameter .    an immediately interesting feature of this result is that for a lorentz factor of 5 ( corresponding to a doppler factor @xmath54 ) and timescales of a few days , the size of the shocked region in the direction of flow is comparable to the radii inferred from fits of the spherical model .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the insensitivity of the size of the shocked region to its pressure .",
    "we have already seen that the pressure in the shocked region can be estimated from the relative velocity of the unshocked gas on either side of the reverse - forward shock region .",
    "the relative velocity also enters into the condition for a forward  reverse shock pair to occur .",
    "the relative velocity needs to be large enough to produce a pressure , @xmath39 , between the shocks that is greater than both @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the limiting case occurs when @xmath57 .",
    "this leads to the following condition on the relative velocity , @xmath58 of the gas on either side of the shocked region : @xmath59        if the relative velocity is less than this critical value , that is , if the variation in velocity is not substantial enough , then a forward  reverse shock structure does not form . in order to gain some numerical insight",
    ", one can assign a lorentz factor to the overtaking gas ( region 1 ) and use equation  ( [ e : b12 ] ) to calculate the _ maximum _ lorentz factor of the gas ahead of the forward shock ( region 2 ) for a two - shock solution to occur .",
    "the maximum lorentz factor is shown in figure  [ f : lf_max ] for overtaking lorentz factors , @xmath60 of 5 and 10 .",
    "the relevant parameter here is the ratio of the pressures downstream of the forward shock , @xmath56 and upstream of the reverse shock , @xmath55 .",
    "for example , if @xmath61 and @xmath62 then the maximum lorentz factor of the upstream gas is about 4.3 .",
    "if the lorentz factor of the upstream gas exceeds this value then an intermediate shocked region with pressure greater than both @xmath56 and @xmath55 can not be supported .",
    "the outcome is a rarefaction wave moving into the downstream gas and a reverse shock moving into the upstream gas .",
    "when @xmath63 the situation is reversed .    as in the non - relativistic case ( see ) , the rarefaction region is described by a centred , simple wave @xcite .",
    "simple waves are based on the riemann invariants , @xmath64 , of the one - dimensional gas dynamics equations and for the equation of state @xmath65 @xmath66 in the region of right propagating simple wave , @xmath67 and the equations of the right propagating characteristics are : @xmath68 these two features of a centred simple wave allow one to develop the solution in the rarefaction region and patch it to the solution on the left representing the reverse shock ( see figure  [ f : shock_tube ] ) . as with the two - shock solution",
    "it is convenient to develop the shock plus rarefaction solution in the frame of the contact discontinuity and in terms of the pressure , @xmath39 in the post - shock region . in this frame , the unshocked gas velocity on the left is given by : @xmath69 and the velocity on the right is given by : @xmath70 the frame - independent relative velocity , @xmath71 can be used to solve numerically for the pressure , @xmath39 in terms of @xmath58 if required .    in this solution ,",
    "the velocity of the reverse shock in the contact discontinuity frame ( which is also the rest frame of the shocked gas ) is the same as that of the reverse shock in the two - shock case , i.e. @xmath72 and the size of the shocked region in the cd frame as a function of the observer s time is also similar , viz . :",
    "inspection of the rxte spectra and the @xmath3ray light curve show that the second flare begins at @xmath74 where @xmath75 refers to jd2,440,000 .",
    "this means that epoch  6 for which we have presented the two component models ( see figure  [ f:501_fit ] ) corresponds to @xmath76 and x  ray epoch 10 corresponds to @xmath77 .",
    "the entire period surrounding this flare involved such a marked departure from the quiescent flux of markarian  501 that it is reasonable to assume that the relative velocity exceeded the critical value derived above and that @xmath78 giving a longitudinal size for the flaring region @xmath79 .",
    "we neglect for now the complications resulting from calculating the inverse compton emissivity in a non - spherical region and , in order to obtain indicative estimates of the radius of the emitting disk  like region of the jet , we assume that the volume of the emitting region is the same as that of the corresponding spherical region as modelled previously . as recorded in table  [ t : disk_fits ] , this gives radii ranging from about @xmath80 to @xmath81 cm .",
    "thus , the emitting region is a reasonably thin slice of the jet , and in the rest frame , the ratio of its longitudinal extent to its diameter ranges from 0.01 to 0.3 , depending upon the details of the model .",
    "the estimate of the longitudinal size arises naturally from the dynamics of the shocked region and one does not have to appeal to adiabatic expansion to limit the effective size .",
    "this is also the case for the shock plus rarefaction solution .",
    "as the flare evolves , by epoch 10 the x  ray spectrum ( see figure  [ f : epochs2 - 10 ] ) has settled down to a shape similar to that of the original flare in epoch 2 .",
    "we regard this as indicating the establishment of a quasi  steady state spectrum in which cooling following a shock ( or shocks ) has established a broken power ",
    "law with the break energy at about 6  kev .",
    "this spectral feature provides further constraints on the model with interesting implications .",
    "the criterion for the location of the break is somewhat contrived in the framework of a spherical model .",
    "this is especially the case with temporal data since there is really no criterion for how the radius of the emitting region would evolve .",
    "we therefore shall not burden the reader with calculations appropriate for a spherical geometry and we only consider the implications of the spectral break for the disk model whose dynamics we have considered above .    a break in spectral index in the context of shock - generated spectra occurs at that photon energy where the cooling time of electrons is equal to the travel time of the plasma across the emitting region . in this case",
    "this means that the cooling time at the break energy equals the duration of the flare .",
    "often , only the effect of synchrotron cooling is considered . however , in many blazars the inverse compton power is comparable to or greater than the synchrotron power and the contribution of inverse compton cooling to the total cooling timescale must be considered . when inverse compton scattering in the klein - nishina limit is involved ( as it is for tev blazars )",
    "the calculation of the cooling time is more complicated than it is when the thomson limit applies .",
    "however , in the klein - nishina limit , both the cross - section and energy transfer decrease and we therefore assume that the dominant inverse compton contribution occurs for interactions between photons and the radiation field that occur in the thomson limit .",
    "thus , in estimating the appropriate radiation energy density for an electron of lorentz factor , @xmath3 , in the plasma rest frame , one determines a cutoff photon energy , @xmath82 , in the observer s frame , defined by @xmath83 for a cylindrical uniformly emitting disk of length , @xmath84 , and radius , @xmath20 , the radiation energy density per unit frequency at the centre of the disk in the plasma rest frame and the observed flux density are given by : @xmath85 where @xmath86 for a thin disk , @xmath87 and @xmath88 . thus the radiation energy density is defined in terms of the flux density , @xmath89 by : @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the cutoff in photon energy ( observer s frame ) defined above and @xmath92 is a convenient fiducial energy .",
    "the synchrotron plus inverse compton cooling time , corresponding to the break energy , @xmath93 , is , in the plasma rest frame : @xmath94^{-1 } { \\epsilon_b^\\prime}^{-1/2 }   \\\\ & \\approx & 3.23 \\times 10 ^ 3 \\ , b^{-3/2 } \\left[1 + \\frac { u_{\\rm rad}^\\prime}{u_b } \\right]^{-1 } \\ ,   \\delta^{1/2 } \\ , \\left ( \\frac { \\epsilon_b}{\\rm kev } \\right)^{-1/2 } \\ > \\rm sec\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath95 . in order to compare with the observed flare duration",
    ", we use the corresponding time in the observer s frame : @xmath96^{-1 } \\ ,   \\left(\\delta \\gamma^2 \\right)^{1/2 } \\ , \\left ( \\frac { \\epsilon_b}{\\rm kev } \\right)^{-1/2 } \\ > \\rm sec\\ ] ]    normally , one would invert the expression for @xmath97 to obtain an expression for the break energy @xmath93 as a function of time .",
    "however , @xmath97 depends both explicitly on the break energy and implicitly through the dependence of @xmath98 upon @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , in assessing the implications of the break in the x - ray spectrum , it is easiest to compare the cooling time , @xmath97 at the observed break energy with the time of duration of the flare ( approximately 4.2 days at epoch 10 ) .",

    "the opacity depends upon the doppler factor to a large power , so that a large doppler factor can also render the observation of tev @xmath3-rays consistent with the photon energy densities required to produce them .    at first sight",
    "it appears that this disk model for the shocked region offers a better prospect for the escape of @xmath3rays because of the reduced path length in the direction of the jet .",
    "however , aberration implies that in the rest frame , photon trajectories are almost perpendicular to the jet thereby increasing the path length .",
    "specifically , if @xmath105 is the size , in the rest frame , of the disk , if @xmath106 is the angle between the jet and the line of sight in the observer s frame , and if @xmath107 is the jet velocity , then the path length of a ray through the disk originating from the back is given by : @xmath108 ( with the proviso that @xmath109 has a maximum @xmath110 the diameter of the shocked region . )",
    "the value of @xmath111 tends to compensate for the smaller value of @xmath105 implied by our disk model so that one can only expect a modest reduction in @xmath3ray opacity compared to a spherical model .",
    "therefore in table  [ t : disk_fits ] we have given the @xmath3ray opacity for 10  tev photons based on the diameter of the emitting disk .",
    "the emitting region is only marginally optically thin in this case .    on the other hand ,",
    "the specific _ normal _ shock configuration , upon which we have based our models represents the worst case for @xmath3ray opacity . if the shock(s ) defining the disk ,",
    "were oblique then the photons emitted perpendicular to the jet direction in the rest frame would not have such a large path length and a reduction in opacity by an order of magnitude would result .",
    "we have therefore , as an indication of the reduction in opacity related to this model , have tabulated the optical depth based upon the longitudinal extent of the slab .",
    "naturally this is much less and indicates the importance of generalising this model to the case of oblique shocks .    despite these potential reductions in @xmath3ray opacity",
    ", it appears that the emission of @xmath3rays originates not far above the @xmath112 surface  the gammasphere @xcite.it is possible therefore , that x - ray flares generated at smaller radii will have no tev counterpart .",
    "an examination of the combined tev and x - ray light curves would be interesting in this regard .",
    "we have presented a simple theoretical approach to determining the geometry of synchrotron and inverse compton emitting regions in blazar jets that is intimately related to the dynamics of the underlying flow .",
    "of course , other treatments of blazar emission regions that postulate relativistic shocks from the outset ( e.g. ) would give similar estimates for the size of the emitting region .",
    "what we have shown here is how the emission region patches onto the rest of the jet and how it is determined by the flow parameters of different sections . for high enough relative velocities , the emission region",
    "is bounded by two shocks ; for relative velocities lower than critical the emission region patches on via a simple wave . in the latter case both forward and reverse shocks are possible depending upon the relative strengths of the pressure in the two regions .    using this approach ,",
    "we have shown that the extent ( in the jet direction ) of the shocked emission region is similar to , but smaller than , what has previously been inferred from spherical models . making the approximation that the inverse compton emission from a shocked section of jet is the same as from the equivalent sphere ,",
    "we have shown how spectral breaks and pair optical depths may be estimated .",
    "there are some interesting differences here between models calculated using tev spectra that have been corrected to allow for the opacity of the infrared background ( irb ) and comparable models for which no corrections have been applied . referring to table  [ t : disk_fits ]",
    ", one can see that the irb  corrected models are more compact and the estimated cooling times are less than the observed duration of the flare .",
    "moreover , the pair opacity at 10 tev is quite significant even in the most favourable case of basing the opacity on the length of the shocked region . in the case of no irb correction ,",
    "it is feasible that the cooling time and the flare time become equal for doppler factors between 10 and 20 . in this regime",
    "also , the pair opacity can be reasonably low .",
    "thus it is possible that the irb opacity estimated by may be too high .",
    "however , in view of the various approximations used , these conclusions can only be regarded as tentative .",
    "however , they do point the way to more detailed models in which the various effects can be modelled in more detail .",
    "such models should include detailed calculations of inverse compton emission in anisotropic radiation fields and the calculation of the post - shock flow , taking into account both particle acceleration and relativistic fluid dynamics .",
    "our approach to modelling shocks in relativistic jets that we have described above is analytic and one can ask if there is there any point in such a treatment given the impressive simulations of relativistic jets that have been carried in recent years ? ( for an introduction to the literature on this work one may consult the recent papers of , and . )",
    "the answer is yes for several reasons :    1 .",
    "analytic / semi - analytic approximations of jet dynamics are useful when modelling blazar emission and for other analytic estimates of jet behaviour . simple models ( provided they capture the relevant physics ) streamline the process of model fitting",
    "the numerical simulations are extremely useful for the purpose for which they were intended , e.g. in comparing relativistic and nonrelativistic jet stability or in a qualitative assessment of the behaviour of superluminal components @xcite . however ,",
    "for computational reasons related to the courant criterion , the jet densities of the simulations do not approach the low values that we expect of relativistic jets in agn . to be specific , consider a jet in which the relativistic electron distribution has a lower cutoff at a lorentz factor of @xmath113 ; let the pressures of the jet and interstellar medium ( ism ) be @xmath114 and @xmath115 respectively , and let @xmath116 be the temperature of the ism ; let @xmath14 be the electron spectral index",
    ". then the ratio of jet electron number density to ism electron number density is given by : @xmath117 for a jet in pressure equilibrium with its surroundings and @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , for an electron - proton jet and an ism temperature @xmath119 , the ratio of densities is of order @xmath120 since @xmath121 @xcite . for an electron - positron jet , @xmath122 and the ratio of mass densities @xmath123 .",
    "the only simulations that begin to approach these remarkable densities are those of , in which the ratio of mass densities is @xmath124 .",
    "of course one can learn a lot from simulations that depend mainly upon the ordering of densities rather than the absolute values .",
    "however , such simulations do not give a good idea of the interaction of the jet with the external medium since this strongly depends upon the jet density ratio .",
    "it is feasible that one can utilise numerical simulations to understand internal jet dynamics in a jet in which the internal energy and the mass density are dominated by relativistic particles if the parameter @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the rest mass density @xcite .",
    "for the low density simulations of @xmath127 for the parameters of the simulation , @xmath128 .",
    "for one thing , this means that the velocities of internal shocks are not relevant to blazar emission regions in such a model .",
    "one could put several counter - arguments to the above .",
    "for example , the interstellar medim temperature could be higher .",
    "but then one would have to reconcile this with the lack of observed high temperature bremsstrahlung from agn . in summary ,",
    "the current simulations are impressive and the various groups involved have boldly moved into a previously uncharted region of parameter space . however , the simulations do not currently address the physics of blazars .",
