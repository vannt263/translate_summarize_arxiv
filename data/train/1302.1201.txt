    "the broad history of the universe , according to the standard cosmological model , is a succession of expansion epochs from the earliest moments of the big bang to the present day . in reverse chronological order ,",
    "these are : dark - energy domination , during which something like a cosmological constant drives the accelerated cosmic expansion ; matter - domination , during which cold dark matter and baryons shape the large - scale structure of the universe ; radiation - domination , during which the properties of the cosmic fluid are described by the relativistic degrees of freedom of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics and beyond ; and inflation , during which the potential energy of a scalar degree of freedom dominates the cosmic energy density , producing an exponential burst of cosmic expansion . despite fundamental uncertainties  the nature of dark energy and dark matter , and the physics beyond the standard model remain open questions , whilst the search continues for direct evidence of the inflationary birth of the universe  this sequence of epochs forms the architecture of a widely - accepted , concordant model of the universe .",
    "the aim of this article is to give a more quantitatively accurate account of cosmic history than one obtains from patching together inflationary , radiation- , matter- , and dark energy - dominated epochs .",
    "it may often suffice to describe the cosmic energy density @xmath0 in terms of the scale factor @xmath1 and the equation of state @xmath2 for inflation , radiation , matter , and dark energy .",

    "[ fig : tracefullhist ] .    to make these calculations ,",
    "we must properly account for the thermal history of the cosmological fluid , the dynamics of the phase transition of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and we must give some account of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "we do not solve the full boltzmann equations , as necessary for the standard calculations of the light element abundances in big bang nucleosynthesis and the relic dark matter abundance in extensions of the standard model ( e.g. @xcite ) , but instead use free field thermodynamics where applicable .",
    "we also make some assumptions about inflation and reheating in the early universe in order to follow @xmath11 and @xmath9 all the way back to the inflationary epoch .",
    "it is often supposed that the trace of the stress - energy tensor is negligibly small during the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "it is also supposed that the dominant contribution to the trace comes from baryons and dark matter .",
    "both of these suppositions are incorrect : massive particle species contribute non - negligibly to the trace when the temperature is comparable to their mass ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite , wherein the history of @xmath9 is required to study cosmic evolution in a scalar - tensor theory of gravitation ) , and the effect of phase transitions on the trace of the stress - energy tensor is in fact much larger than the small contribution from baryons and dark matter .    our motivation is to chart a detailed history of @xmath9 as comprehensively as we can .",
    "two advances outside of cosmology make this possible .",
    "first , progress in lattice qcd shows that the self - interactions of the quark - gluon plasma produce a trace that is very different than what one would obtain using free field theory @xcite .",
    "second , the higgs mass is now known  or at least , the mass of a particle whose most straightforward interpretation is the standard model higgs @xcite . because we do nt know what lies beyond the standard model , we offer two scenarios . in the first scenario ( despite all arguments about naturalness ) nothing lies beyond the standard model until one reaches the energy scale of inflation , only somewhat below the typical scale of grand unified theories . in the second scenario ,",
    "there is a supersymmetric extension of the standard model plausibly within the reach of discovery at the lhc , and then inflationary physics at a similar energy scale to before .",
    "our final figure covers the entire history of the universe from inflation to the present day for both scenarios .",

    "we also ignore all fluctuations and effects of structure formation : our purpose is only to find the robertson - walker ( rw ) background that best approximates the expanding universe at very large scales .",
    "the free field treatment of the radiation - dominated epoch is based on the following standard formulas for a collection of non - interacting fermions and bosons in thermal equilibrium : @xmath25 where the sum is over all species of particle , @xmath26 is the mass of the @xmath27-th species , @xmath28 is its multiplicity , and @xmath29 for bosons and @xmath30 for fermions @xcite .",
    "we have allowed for different species to have different temperatures @xmath31 . for each collection of mutually thermally equilibrated particles , the common temperature must evolve in such a way that the collection s contribution to the stress - energy tensor is conserved .",
    "it is not necessary to generalize ( [ freee ] ) and ( [ freep ] ) to include chemical potentials , because all the relevant chemical potentials ( for example , for baryon number ) are small compared to the temperature at times when explicit expressions for non - zero pressure are needed .",

    "neutrinos become non - relativistic at a time when the radiation energy density is smaller than the contribution due to baryons and cold dark matter .",

    "when free field thermodynamics fails , what should we use instead ?",

    "one of the main conclusions of this section , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : electroweakcomparison ] , is that , close to the peak of @xmath34 , free field thermodynamics based on the vacuum particle spectrum nevertheless provides a decent approximation to the ring - improved one - loop treatment of @xcite , which is the simplest account of the electroweak transition that avoids obvious inconsistencies such as imaginary masses . at substantially higher temperatures",

    "the history of curvature at earlier times requires a theory of the early universe , which we take to be the inflationary dynamics of a scalar field . whereas other theories of the primordial universe will yield different predictions for the trace and curvature , the merit of inflation is the consistency with observations and ubiquity of examples .",

    "recall that the linearized perturbation to the ricci scalar in a coordinate system @xmath170 is @xmath171 , and @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is a familiar variable from studies of inflation .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite . ) for perturbations of wavelength much greater than the radiation - era hubble radius , specifically those perturbations responsible for the observed large - scale structure , then @xmath173 is a constant in time and @xmath174 becomes negligibly small so that @xmath175 . in this case , the homogeneous quantities we have calculated provide the leading contribution .    to conclude this brief history of curvature , we show all three epochs in a single display , in fig .  [",
    "fig : tracefullhist ] .",
    "the history of the curvature and trace are of interest , beyond their intrinsic value as a record of the significant events in the large - scale evolution of our universe .",
    "for example , an accounting of the thermal history of the universe is necessary to accurately account for the spectrum of inflation - produced gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "however , the most dramatic effect may arise when considering new gravitational phenomena beyond general relativity .",
    "gravitational theories that introduce new degrees of freedom may require an accurate model of the trace of the stress - energy tensor .",
    "the canonical example is the nonminimally - coupled scalar field , for which the lagrangian is @xmath176 and where @xmath177 includes the standard model .",
    "the @xmath178 equation of motion is @xmath179 so the curvature introduces a novel , time- and space - dependent effective mass such that when @xmath180 then the field is susceptible to a tachyonic instability ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the curvature is set by the dynamics of the field , which are in turn sourced by the trace of the stress - energy of any other forms of matter .",
    "specifically , @xmath181 in the case of a strongly coupled field with @xmath182 , for which @xmath183 so that the @xmath178 field does not dominate the stress - energy , then we have approximately @xmath184 . in the case of a conformally - coupled field , @xmath185 and @xmath186 , then @xmath187 , which means that the trace calculated in this paper is directly applicable to the evolution of @xmath178 : every feature in our @xmath9 curve results in a feature in @xmath178 .",
    "similarly , nonlocal quantum gravitational effects that depend upon quantities such as @xmath188 or @xmath189 , where @xmath190 is a fourth - order conformally - invariant operator @xcite , are sensitive to the history of curvature .",
    "consequently , the results presented in this paper for the evolution of the trace may prove useful in detailed studies of new gravitational physics , such as gravitationally - coupled inflation @xcite or dark - energy motivated modifications of gravity ( _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite , or @xcite and references therein ) .",
