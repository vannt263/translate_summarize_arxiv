    "the evolutionary hamilton  jacobi equation @xmath0 appears in diverse mathematical models ranging from analytical mechanics to combinatorics , condensed matter , turbulence , and cosmology ( see , e.g. , a non - exhaustive set of references in @xcite ) . in many of these applications the objects of interest",
    "are described by singularities of solutions , which inevitably appear for generic initial data after a finite time due to the nonlinearity of  .",
    "therefore one of the central issues both for theory and applications is to understand the behaviour of the system after singularities form .",
    "in particular , behaviour of characteristics after formation of singularities was the subject of intensive studies in the last two decades .",
    "the main question here is whether there exists a natural extension of characteristics as `` particle trajectories '' after a `` particle '' reaches the shock manifold .",
    "the problem is highly nontrivial since the velocity field is not well defined on the shock manifold . in a series of works p.  cannarsa and his collaborators",
    "developed the notion of generalized characteristics as `` integral '' curves satisfying a certain natural differential inclusion condition .",
    "it seems however that such an approach is far too general ; in particular , generalized characteristics are often defined not uniquely .",
    "the examples of non - uniqueness were constructed in @xcite by p.  cannarsa and y.  yu . in fact , as we show in this paper , there are very few examples of uniqueness . apart from the one - dimensional case uniqueness",
    "can only happen in the case of quadratic hamiltonians ( see section  [ sec : regul - with - weak ] ) .",
    "instead of considering the most general definition we propose to study particle trajectories corresponding to physically relevant regularization schemes . in this paper",
    "we discuss two such types of regularization : a viscous regularization and a regularization by small additive noise . in both cases",
    "one can construct an effective velocity field corresponding to the limit of vanishing regularization parameter ( the viscosity , or the intensity of noise ) .",
    "these two limits are essentially different apart from the two uniqueness cases described above .",
    "central to the present paper is the idea of self - consistent selection of effective velocity .",
    "this notion of self - consistency allows to define a unique effective velocity field in the case of viscous regularization .",
    "we then use the notion of higher - order consistency to address the problem of uniqueness of particle trajectories . in the case of weak noise regularization",
    "the velocity is not necessarily uniquely selected by the self - consistency principle .",
    "we , however , believe that entropy maximization condition will lead to unique dynamics in the case of general hamiltonians h ( see section  [ sec : conclusions ] ) . a useful example to be borne in mind when thinking about these problems  and arguably the most widely known variant of equation  is the riemann , or inviscid burgers , equation . in the physics notation ( the dot @xmath1 for inner product and @xmath2 for spatial gradient )",
    "this equation has the form @xmath3 the first eq",
    ".   corresponds to the hamiltonian @xmath4 .",
    "this equation may in turn be considered as a limit of vanishing viscosity of the burgers equation @xmath5 so solutions of   can be defined as limits of smooth solutions to   as the positive parameter @xmath6 goes to zero .",
    "the burgers equation is in fact very special : it can be exactly mapped by the cole ",
    "hopf transformation into the linear heat equation and therefore explicitly integrated , which in turn allows to explicitly study the limit @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "although in the case of general convex hamiltonian the hopf  cole transformation is not available , the qualitative behaviour of solutions to a parabolic regularization of   @xmath8 as viscosity vanishes is similar to that for the burgers equation .",
    "the limit @xmath9 exists and is called the _ entropy _ ( or _ viscosity _ ) _ solution_. a theory of weak solutions for a general hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation , employing the regularization by infinitesimal viscosity , exists since the 1970s @xcite . in the one - dimensional setting",
    "this theory is essentially equivalent to the earlier theory of hyperbolic conservation laws @xcite .",
    "the theory of weak solutions for the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation is closely related to calculus of variations , and introduction of diffusion corresponds to stochastic control arguments @xcite .",
    "the viewpoint of the present paper is somewhat complementary : the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation is considered as a fluid dynamics model , and the main goal is to construct a flow of `` fluid particles '' inside the shocks of a weak solution .",
    "however it is convenient to start with the lax ",
    "oleinik variational pronciple , which provides a purely variational construction of the viscosity solution .",
    "remarkably this construction does not use any explicit viscous regularization .",
    "assume that the hamiltonian function @xmath10 is smooth and strictly convex in the momentum variable @xmath11 , i.e. , is such that for all @xmath12 the graph of @xmath10 as a function of @xmath11 lies above any tangent plane and contains no straight segments .",
    "this implies that the formula @xmath13 establishes a one - to - one correspondence between values of velocity  @xmath14 and momentum  @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the lagrangian function @xmath15,\\ ] ] under the above hypotheses is smooth and strictly convex in  @xmath14 .",
    "( note that @xmath16 may be not finite everywhere : e.g. , the relativistic hamiltonian @xmath17 corresponds to the lagrangian @xmath18 that is defined for @xmath19 as @xmath20 and takes value @xmath21 elsewhere .",
    "this does not happen if in addition one assumes that the hamiltonian @xmath22 grows superlinearly in @xmath23 . )",
    "the relation between the lagrangian and the hamiltonian is symmetric : they are legendre ",
    "fenchel conjugate   to one another .",
    "this relation can also be expressed in the form of the young inequality : @xmath24 which holds for all @xmath14 and  @xmath11 and turns into equality whenever @xmath25 or equivalently @xmath26 .",
    "the two maps @xmath27 and  @xmath28 are thus inverse to each other ; we will call them the _ legendre transforms _ at @xmath29 of @xmath11 and of  @xmath14 .",
    "( usually the term `` legendre transform '' refers to the relation between the conjugate functions @xmath22 and  @xmath16 ; here we follow the usage that is adopted by a.  fathi in his works on weak kam theory @xcite and is more convenient in the present context . )",
    "note that if @xmath30 , then @xmath31 and the legendre transform reduces to the identity @xmath32 , blurring the distinction between velocities and momenta .",
    "this is another special feature of the ( inviscid ) burgers equations .",
    "now assume that @xmath33 is a strong solution of the inviscid equation  , i.e. , a @xmath34 function that satisfies the equation in the classical sense .",
    "for an arbitrary differentiable trajectory @xmath35 the full time derivative of  @xmath36 along @xmath37 is given by @xmath38 where at the last step the young inequality   is used .",
    "this implies a bound for the mechanical action corresponding to the trajectory @xmath37 : @xmath39 equality in   is only achieved if @xmath40 is the legendre transform of @xmath41 at every point @xmath42 : @xmath43 therefore the bound   is achieved for trajectories satisfying hamilton s canonical equations , with momentum given for the trajectory  @xmath37 by @xmath44 .",
    "( the second canonical equation , @xmath45 , follows from and   for a @xmath46 solution  @xmath36 because @xmath47 where the last two terms cancel . )",
    "this is a manifestation of the variational _ principle of the least action _ :",
    "hamiltonian trajectories @xmath48 are ( locally ) action minimizing .",
    "in particular , if the initial condition @xmath49 is a fixed smooth function , the identity @xmath50 holds for a euler  lagrange trajectory @xmath37 such that @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "however the least action principle has wider validity : in fact it can be used to _ construct _ the viscosity solution corresponding to the initial data  : @xmath53 this is the celebrated lax  oleinik formula ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) , which reduces a pde problem ,   to the variational problem   where minimization is extended to all sufficiently smooth ( in fact absolutely continuous ) curves @xmath37 such that @xmath54 . at those points @xmath12 where the function @xmath36 defined by   is smooth in  @xmath55 , the minimizing trajectory is unique . in this case",
    ", the minimizer can be embedded in a smooth family of minimizing trajectories whose endpoints at time @xmath56 and @xmath57 are continuously distributed about @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( a convenient reference is @xcite*section 6.4 , although this fact is classical ) . a piece of initial data @xmath60 gets continuously deformed according to   along this bundle of trajectories into a piece of smooth solution @xmath36 to   defined in a neighbourhood of  @xmath55 at time  @xmath57 .",
    "of course the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation is satisfied by @xmath36 in strong sense at all points where it is differentiable .",
    "but the crucial feature of   is that generally there will be points @xmath12 with several minimizers @xmath61 that start at different locations @xmath62 and bring the same value of action to  @xmath63 .",
    "just as above , each of these hamiltonian trajectories will be responsible for a separate smooth `` piece '' of solution .",
    "thus for locations @xmath64 close to @xmath55 the function @xmath36 will be represented as a pointwise minimum of these smooth pieces @xmath65 : @xmath66 as all @xmath61 have the same terminal value of action , all the pieces intersect at @xmath12 : @xmath67 .",
    "thus the neighbourhood of @xmath55 at time  @xmath57 is partitioned into domains where @xmath36 coincides with each of the smooth functions  @xmath65 and satisfies the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation   in the strong sense .",
    "these domains are separated by surfaces of various dimensions where two , or possibly three or more , pieces @xmath65 intersect and their pointwise minimum @xmath36 is not differentiable .",
    "such surfaces are called _ shock manifolds _ or simply _",
    "shocks_. note that a function  @xmath36 defined by the lax ",
    "oleinik formula is continuous everywhere , including the shocks ; it is its gradient that suffers a discontinuity . in general , there are infinitely many continuous functions that match the initial condition   and in the complement of the shock surfaces are differentiable and satisfy the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation  , just as  @xmath36 does .",
    "what distinguishes the function  @xmath36 defined by the variational construction   from all these `` weak solutions '' , and grants it with important physical meaning , is that @xmath36 appears in the limit of vanishing viscosity for the regularized equation   with the initial condition   ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for a smooth hamiltonian it can be proved that in a viscosity solution minimizers can only merge with shocks but never leave them .",
    "now observe that in a solution  @xmath36 given by the lax ",
    "olenik formula   a minimizer that has come to a shock can not be continued any longer as a minimizing trajectory : wherever it might go , there will be other trajectories originated at @xmath68 that will bring smaller values of action to the same location .",
    "hence for the purpose of the least action description  , hamiltonian trajectories become irrelevant as soon as they hit shocks .",
    "the set of trajectories which survive as minimizers until time  @xmath69 is decreasing with @xmath57 , but at all times it is sufficiently large to cover the whole continuum of final positions .",
    "let us now adopt an alternative `` lagrangian '' viewpoint , assuming that trajectories   are described by material `` particles '' transported by the velocity field @xmath70 , which is the legendre transform of the momenta field @xmath71 . from this new perspective",
    "it is no longer natural to accept that particles annihilate once they reach a shock .",
    "can therefore something be said about the dynamics of those particles that got into the shock , notwithstanding the fact that their trajectories cease to minimize the action ?",
    "the difficulty in such an approach is related to the discontinuous nature of the velocity field @xmath72 , which makes it impossible to construct classical solutions to the transport equation @xmath73 . in dimension",
    "@xmath74 the answer to the question above is readily available .",
    "shocks at each fixed @xmath57 are isolated points in the @xmath55 space and as soon as a trajectory merges with one of them , it continues to move with the shock at all later times .",
    "this definition gives rise to dynamics that is related to c.  dafermos theory of generalized characteristics ( see @xcite and references therein ) which , in fact , can be extended to a much more general situation of nonconvex hamiltonians and systems of conservation laws .",
    "in several space dimensions shock manifolds are extended surfaces of different codimension , and dynamics of trajectories inside shocks is by no means trivial .",
    "a general definition of generalized characteristic in this case is due to cannarsa @xcite . for the case of the burgers equation   dynamics",
    "inside shocks was constructed in the work of i.  bogaevsky @xcite using the following approach .",
    "consider the differential equation @xmath75 since @xmath76 for @xmath77 is a smooth vector field , this equation defines a family of particle trajectories that form a smooth flow . the next step is to take the limit of this flow as @xmath78 .",
    "it turns out that this limit exists as a non - differentiable continuous flow , for which the forward derivative @xmath79/\\tau$ ] is defined everywhere .",
    "if @xmath35 is located outside shocks , this derivative coincides with @xmath80 .",
    "otherwise the effective velocity   @xmath81 is determined by the extremal values of velocities @xmath82 at the shock , and there is an interesting explicit representation for it : @xmath81 coincides with the center of the smallest ball that contains all  @xmath83 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bogaevsky ] ) .",
    "the limiting flow turns out to be _ coalescing _ ( and therefore not time - reversible ) : once any two trajectories intersect , they stay together for all later times .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     moreover , it turns out that pieces of the shock manifold may be classified into _ restraining _ and _ nonrestraining _ depending on whether trajectories stay on them or leave them along pieces of shock manifold of lower codimension , case ( c ) corresponds to a nonrestraining triple point in @xmath84 , which trajectories leave through the shock line that divides domains of smooth flow with limiting velocities @xmath85 and  @xmath86 ; see fig .  3 from @xcite and the discussion therein .",
    "shocks of codimension one are always restraining ; in particular , such are all shocks in the one - dimensional case .",
    "interestingly , this classification , introduced for the first time by bogaevsky in  @xcite ( `` acute '' and `` obtuse '' superdifferentials of  @xmath36 ) seems to have been overlooked by physicists despite its clear physical significance  @xcite .",
    "the proofs of all these facts in  @xcite were based on specific properties of the quadratic hamiltonian and can not be extended to the general setting of a convex hamiltonian . in this work",
    "we follow a different approach to the vanishing viscosity limit in the general setting , employing the idea of self - consistency and based on the variational representation proposed in our earlier work @xcite*subsection  4.2 ( see also @xcite*section  3 ) .",
    "this approach , which employs the fundamental uniqueness of the possible limiting behaviour of  @xmath87 , leads to results on existence , uniqueness , and explicit representation of the limit velocities .",
    "it should be remarked that equation , which relates the velocity @xmath40 of a trajectory to the gradient  @xmath88 of the solution , can be seen as defining a generalization of the gradient flow of the function  @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "such a flow coincides with the conventional gradient flow when @xmath89 and @xmath36 is smooth .",
    "the case of a concave ( or semiconcave ) nonsmooth  @xmath36 can be handled using the differential inequality that goes back to the work of h.  brzis @xcite .",
    "a similar approach was also used by p.  cannarsa and c.  sinestrari in the context of propagation of singularities for the eikonal equation with quadratic hamiltonian @xcite*lemma  5.6.2 .",
    "later , cannarsa and y.  yu @xcite proposed an approach to the case of a general convex hamiltonian that leads to selection of the same effective velocity as in @xcite .",
    "the proofs in @xcite are based on a mollification argument .",
    "the classification of singluarities into `` restraining '' and `` nonrestraining '' seems however to have been unknown before bogaevsky s work  @xcite even in the quadratic case .      in section  [ sec : soft ] we develop a local theory for lagrangian particles in a gradient flow defined by a viscosity solution  @xmath36 . here",
    "we introduce the notions of _ admissible velocity _ and _ admissible momentum _ at a shock , which are central to our approach .",
    "the admissible velocity at each point turns out to be the unique solution to a particular convex minimization problem @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which extends the construction of the center of the smallest euclidean ball ( cf fig .",
    "[ fig : bogaevsky ] ) to the general convex case . in section  [ sec : vanish - visc - limit ] the limit of a flow regularized with small viscosity is shown to be tangent to the field of admissible velocities .",
    "this establishes an existence theorem for integral curves of this field .",
    "we further discuss the issue of uniqueness of the limiting trajectories and propose a formal perturbative approach that allows to determine the higher time derivatives of limiting trajectories . in section",
    "[ sec : regul - with - weak ] , a different approach to regularization is discussed , which is in a sense dual to regularization with vanishing viscosity : regularization with weak noise .",
    "although the two approaches are parallel and in particular both feature a self - consistency condition that selects `` good '' velocities at singular points , it turns out that in the latter approach the self - consistent velocity may fail to be unique in dimensions greater than  @xmath90 . we also show that the weak noise regularisation generally corresponds to a different effective velocity field .",
    "the concluding section contains a discussion and a list of several open problems .    some results of this paper , including the proof of theorem  1 , appeared in conference proceedings @xcite . in the course of this work we benefitted from valuable remarks of jrmie bec , patrick bernard , ilya bogaevsky , yann brenier , philippe choquard , michael dabkowski , uriel frisch , boris khesin , and an anonymous referee .",
    "it is a pleasure to recognize their help as well as the unique environment of the observatoire de la cte dazur , where this work was started and advanced .",
    "let @xmath36 be a viscosity solution to the hamilton  jacobi equation   with initial data  .",
    "we shall use the following standard facts , for which we refer the reader again to the recent and very useful exposition in @xcite*section 6.4 , although many of these facts date from 50 and more years ago : ( i ) the function @xmath36 is locally uniformly semiconcave in @xmath29 variables ; ( ii ) if there is a single minimizer coming to  @xmath29 , then @xmath36 is differentiable at this point , @xmath46 smooth in some its neighbourhood , and @xmath91 ( iii ) if @xmath36 is not differentiable at @xmath12 and there is a finite number of minimizers @xmath61 such that @xmath92 , then each of them corresponds to a different smooth branch  @xmath65 of solution defined in the neighbourhood of  @xmath29 . then the lax ",
    "oleinik formula implies that @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in the latter case",
    "neither of expressions @xmath96 provides a valid linear approximation to the difference @xmath97 at all points , but they all _ majorize _ this difference up to a remainder that is either linear or higher - order , depending on @xmath98 and  @xmath99 .",
    "evidently , so does the linear form @xmath100 for any convex combination @xmath101 with @xmath102 , @xmath103 . in convex analysis",
    "these convex combinations are called _ supergradients _ of @xmath36 at @xmath12 and the whole collecton of them , which is a convex polytope with vertices @xmath104 , is called the _ superdifferential _ of @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "we use for the superdifferential the notation @xmath105 . to avoid a possible misunderstanding",
    "it should be noted that , although uniqueness of a minimizer coming to  @xmath106 implies differentiability in  @xmath107 of a nonsmooth solution  @xmath36 to the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation at @xmath57 and earlier times , it does _ not _ imply its differentiability at any @xmath108 .",
    "however the differentiability is recovered as @xmath109 , because the corresponding superdifferential shrinks to the gradient of  @xmath36 at @xmath106 .",
    "such points @xmath106 where the differentiability can not be extended to an open neighbourhood in spacetime are often called _",
    "preshocks_[pg : preshock ] ( see @xcite and references therein ) and correspond to conjugate points of a corresponding variational problem ; a classification of all the possible combinations of shocks and preshocks in dimensions @xmath84 and  @xmath110 is provided in @xcite .",
    "note that at a preshock the linearization of @xmath65 does not fully anticipate the shocks at times @xmath111 for any @xmath112 . under a viscous regularization @xmath113 of the solution  @xmath36 , a shock point @xmath12 is `` smeared '' over a small area where @xmath114 takes on all values from relative interior of @xmath115 .",
    "thus , intuitively , @xmath115 is a set of values taken by the spacetime gradient of the nonsmooth function  @xmath36 in an infinitesimal neighbourhood of  @xmath12 . completing the gradient field with superdifferentials at points where @xmath36 is not smooth recovers , in a weaker sense , the continuity of the map @xmath116 . indeed , suppose @xmath117 converges to @xmath12 and the sequence @xmath118 has a limit point @xmath119 . by definition of superdifferential , @xmath120 passing here to the limit and using continuity of  @xmath36 , we see that @xmath121 .",
    "therefore the superdifferential @xmath115 contains all the limit points of superdifferentials @xmath122 as @xmath117 converges to @xmath12 . to make this continuity argument rigorous ,",
    "some control is needed over the remainder term in  .",
    "this is easy for convex or concave functions @xcite , for which such inequalities hold without remainders . a wider function class , which contains viscosity solutions of hamilton  jacobi equations and in which such control is still possible , is formed by semiconvex or semiconcave functions @xcite .",
    "we refer a reader interested in proofs of this and other convex analytic results used in this paper to monographs @xcite",
    ".      this section will describe a procedure that gives a unique possible velocity and momentum at each point @xmath12 .",
    "the construction is based solely on the convexity of hamiltonian in the momentum variable . if @xmath12 is a regular point , i.e. , not a point of shock , then the velocity @xmath123 and the momentum @xmath124",
    "are naturally defined .",
    "suppose now that @xmath12 is a point of shock formed by intersection of smooth branches @xmath65 , @xmath125 .",
    "for a particle starting from a shock point @xmath106 its possible velocity @xmath14 must correspond to one of the the `` available '' momenta , i.e. , to a momentum @xmath11 that belongs to the convex hull of the momenta @xmath126 , @xmath127 , or equivalently to the @xmath128-projection of the superdifferential @xmath115 .",
    "in fact more can be said . for an infinitesimal positive @xmath98 ,",
    "when the particle has already left its original location with velocity  @xmath129 , not all branches @xmath65 will be relevant for the solution @xmath36 at a point @xmath130 as @xmath131 , but only those that contribute to the linear approximation of the solution , i.e. , the minimum in @xmath132 ( cf .   with @xmath133 ) .",
    "the branches not contributing to the minimum can be discarded .",
    "denote the set of relevant indices @xmath134 it is nonempty because the minimum is attained due to convexity of  @xmath135 .",
    "we can now postulate that any possible velocity @xmath14 of a lagrangian particle inside a shock satisfies the following condition .",
    "a velocity @xmath136 is said to be _ admissible _ at @xmath106 if the corresponding momentum @xmath137 belongs to the convex hull of momenta @xmath138 with @xmath139 : @xmath140 this value of momentum @xmath141 is also called _ admissible _ at @xmath106 .",
    "observe that since the index set @xmath142 depends on  @xmath14 , this condition can be viewed as a kind of self - consistency requirement for trajectories .",
    "equivalently , one can write @xmath143 note that , in contrast with early theory of generalized characteristics for hamilton  jacobi equations @xcite*definition 5.5.1 , there is no convex hull taken in   _ after _ the ( nonlinear ) map @xmath144 is apllied to the superdifferential of  @xmath36 at  @xmath145 , even though the resulting set in the velocity space is generally non - convex .",
    "the above definition allows to fix the velocity @xmath136 uniquely .",

    "we see that @xmath149 is a pointwise maximum of strictly convex functions and therefore is strictly convex itself . furthermore , because the hamiltonian @xmath10 is assumed to be finite for all  @xmath11 , its conjugate lagrangian @xmath150 grows faster than any linear function as @xmath151 increases , and thus all its level sets are bounded .",
    "therefore @xmath149 attains its minimum at a unique value of velocity  @xmath136 . to simplify the presentation of ideas we start with an ( elementary ) proof of the theorem in the particular case when @xmath152 is finite .",

    "only the first argument , namely admissibility of the global minimum  @xmath136 , needs modification .",

    "it is clear that depending on the rates @xmath397 ( or equivalently , the values @xmath398 ) at time  @xmath211 , some of the velocities present at  @xmath211 may `` sink '' into the interior of the bregman sphere for small @xmath399 , leaving its surface defined by a smaller set @xmath400 . in a similar way one can define the index sets @xmath401 , @xmath402 , and so on .",
    "notice that this decreasing sequence of index sets will stabilize , since their intersection is nonempty .",
    "we conjecture that the resulting set @xmath403 determines the smooth manifold to which the integral curve @xmath37 belongs and which determines it uniquely as the integral curve of the corresponding filed of admissible velocities .",
    "observe that convergence of superdifferentials makes it possible to use other smoothing procedures for @xmath36 ( e.g. , convoluting it with a standard mollifier ) , giving the same limit trajectories .",
    "however , one can imagine the following completely different regularization of the discontinuous velocity field @xmath404 .",
    "physically speaking , this regularization corresponds to a zero `` prandtl number , '' in contrast with the mollification apporach that corresponds to an infinite `` prandtl number . ''",
    "consider the stochastic equation @xmath405 where @xmath406 is the standard wiener process .",
    "the corresponding stochastic flow is well defined in spite of the fact that @xmath41 does not exist everywhere : whenever the trajectory @xmath407 hits shocks , the noise in the second term will instantaneously steer it in a random direction away from the singularity .",
    "one can show that as @xmath408 the stochastic flow of trajectories @xmath407 tends to a limit flow of trajectories @xmath409 , which is forward differentiable just as the flow constructed by the viscous regularization .",
    "it is easy to see that , due to the averaging , the forward velocity @xmath410 must belong to the convex hull of limit velocities @xmath411 , @xmath412 .",
    "namely , @xmath413 where the velocities @xmath414 are legendre transforms of the corresponding momenta @xmath415 at a singular point @xmath106 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath416 correspond to probabilities that a trajectory @xmath407 visits each of the domains where @xmath417 .",
    "let us call a velocity @xmath418 satisfying condition   _ self - consistent_. the self - consistent velocity is a convex combination of _ velocities _ seen by an infinitesimal observer leaving @xmath106 with velocity  @xmath418 . compare this with the definition of admissible momentum @xmath141 , which is a convex combination of _ momenta _ see by a similar observer moving with velocity  @xmath419 .",
    "when @xmath420 and @xmath421 , self - consistent velocities and admissible velocities coincide .",
    "it is however clear that in the case of a general nonlinear legendre transform @xmath422 . to see this",
    "let us consider the case of the shock manifold of co - dimension one .",
    "then at every point of the shock manifold there are exactly two extreme values of the momenta @xmath423 and @xmath424 , and a sub - differential is a straight interval @xmath425 connecting them . under the viscous regularization ,",
    "the `` effective , '' or admissible , momentum @xmath141 is a point inside @xmath425 . hence the `` effective , ''",
    "i.e. , admissible velocity @xmath419 belongs to the legendre image of @xmath425 , which is the curve @xmath426 . on the contrary , under the weak noise regularization the effective velocity @xmath418 belongs to a straight interval @xmath427 connecting the extreme velocities @xmath428 and @xmath429 .",
    "it is easy to see that when @xmath430 generally the curves @xmath431 and @xmath427 do not intersect outside of the end - points , hence the effective velocities @xmath419 and @xmath418 are necessarily different . of course in the one - dimensional case @xmath431 and @xmath427 coincide .",
    "the only other case when @xmath432 is when the legendre transform is a linear map , or equivalently when the hamiltonian @xmath22 is quadratic in the momentum variable . in both cases uniqueness of generalized characteristics is a well - established fact @xcite .",
    "let @xmath106 , @xmath433 , be a singular point where @xmath434 is a @xmath229-dimensional simplex .",
    "obviously @xmath435 is uniquely defined in the one - dimensional case .",
    "using straightforward but somewhat cumbersome analysis of all particular cases , one can check that in two dimensions there is a unique self - consistent value of velocity @xmath436 , too .",
    "however when @xmath437 , it is possible to construct a convex hamiltonian and a piecewise linear viscosity solution  @xmath36 such that at a certain singular point @xmath106 there are three self - consistent values of velocity .",
    "observe that momenta form a vector space dual to that of velocities ; fix a basis in the velocity space and use the standard scalar product to map momenta and velocities to the same space  @xmath438 .",
    "we shall denote the coordinates by @xmath107 , @xmath439 , @xmath440 and write vectors as @xmath441 . perform a translation of @xmath57 and @xmath107 variables such that @xmath442 , @xmath443 and choose momenta to be represented by vertices of a regular tetrahedron centered at the origin and symmetric with respect to the @xmath444 and @xmath445 planes : @xmath446 denote by @xmath447 , @xmath448 , the corresponding values of the hamiltonian ( to be fixed later ) .",
    "this set of momenta corresponds to the solution @xmath449 to the hamilton ",
    "jacobi equation   as @xmath450 .",
    "if a set of velocities @xmath451 , is the legendre image of this set of momenta , they must satisfy conditions @xmath452 , or equivalently @xmath453 for all @xmath454 .",
    "conversely , for any set of vectors @xmath455 and numbers  @xmath447 , @xmath456 , that satisfy these conditions there exists a strictly convex hamiltonian @xmath457 such that @xmath458 and @xmath459 . to see this ,",
    "define @xmath460 , which satisfies @xmath458 because of  , and `` smooth out '' the function  @xmath461 to get strict convexity in such a way that the values at  @xmath462 are preserved .",
    "now take @xmath463 ( velocities @xmath464 are not yet fixed , so the hamiltonian need not , and wo nt , coincide with @xmath465 everywhere ) .",
    "conditions   are equivalent to the requirement that for each @xmath448 , the momentum vector closest to  @xmath455 is  @xmath462 : indeed , adding @xmath466 to both sides of  , we get @xmath467 for all @xmath468 . in other words , each @xmath455 belongs to the voronoi cell of  @xmath462 .",
    "let now velocities be given by @xmath469 all these velocities are in voronoi cells of momenta with corresponding indices , which ensures that @xmath464 for a suitable convex hamiltonian .",
    "consider now @xmath470 .",
    "it is easy to check using   for  @xmath471 that @xmath472 , so @xmath85 is self - consistent .",
    "but symmetry implies that @xmath473 is also self - consistent .",
    "moreover , the arithmetic average @xmath474 of all @xmath455 is clearly self - consistent as well , which gives three distinct self - consistent values of velocity at the same point .",
    "we conclude with a list of a few open problems concerning the approaches presented above , mostly the viscous regularization .",
    "of course the most important of these problems is the issue of uniqueness of the limit trajectories , discussed in subsection  [ sec : uniq - probl - limit ] above .",
    "furthermore , the flow of limit trajectories  @xmath37 , seen as a family of continuous maps of variational origin from initial coordinates @xmath475 to current coordinates @xmath476 , is clearly relevant for optimal transportation problems @xcite .",
    "an interesting problem suggested by b.  khesin is to study the extremal properties of this flow .",
    "indeed it is known from @xcite that before the first shock formation the flow @xmath477 is and action minimizing flow of diffeomorphisms , while the first shock formation time @xmath478 marks a conjugate point in the corresponding variational problem . according to the suggested view , the flow constructed above may be seen as a kind of saddle - point , rather than minimum , for a suitable transport optimization problem .",
    "finally , we have seen in section  [ sec : regul - with - weak ] that in dimensions @xmath437 the self - consistent velocity , which plays the same role for a flow regularized with weak noise that the admissible velocity does for the viscosity regularization , may fail to be defined uniquely .",
    "it is an interesting problem nevertheless to see whether a unique limiting flow still exists in the limit of weak noise in spite of nonuniqueness of admissible velocity .",
    "this problem carries a certain similarity with the problem of limit behaviour for one - dimensional gibbs measures in the zero - temperature limit , in the case of nonunique ground states ."
