    "let us take the following basis @xmath318 of @xmath119 , where the first @xmath319 elements are the matrices with constant coefficients @xmath320 , following an arbitrary order , and @xmath321 is the identity matrix .",
    "the matrices @xmath122 have been previously defined in ( [ matrhi ] ) .",
    "now , let @xmath322 be a partition of the unity subordinate to @xmath170 .",

    "thus , we make some modifications to obtain the orthogonality with respect to @xmath119 .",
    "we construct the decomposition in two steps .",
    "we deal first with the orthogonality with respect to the matrices with constant coefficients @xmath329 and later with respect to @xmath330 .    _",
    "first step _ : the decomposition in this first step is denoted with the upper index ( 0 ) .",
    "thus , we define the functions @xmath331 as a sort of normalization of @xmath332 with respect to a certain inner product over @xmath333 : @xmath334 where @xmath335 is the characteristic function of @xmath333 .",
    "indeed , notice that @xmath336 for all @xmath337 and @xmath338 , where @xmath339 is the kronecker delta .",

    "moreover , it can be easily observed that @xmath348 , @xmath349 and @xmath350 are identically zero for all @xmath351 .",
    "for this reason the sums indexed over subsets of @xmath263 , for instance @xmath352 , that appear in the first step are finite .",
    "the finiteness of these sums is also verified in the second step .",
    "we know that @xmath353 and the coefficients of @xmath354 are estimated in the following way : @xmath355 for all @xmath356 .",

    "this property is basic to preserve the orthogonality obtained in the first step .",
    "we define the decomposition of @xmath389 in the following way : @xmath390 where @xmath391 in the particular case when @xmath392 , ( [ h - decomp ] ) means    @xmath393    as before , @xmath394 and @xmath395 are identically zero if @xmath351 implying that @xmath396 is identically zero if @xmath351 .    in order to prove ( [ p11 ] ) , notice that @xmath397 and @xmath398 .",

    "first , notice that @xmath402 where @xmath403 is the side length of the cube @xmath333 .",
    "next , using the orthogonality of the collection @xmath404 with respect to @xmath375 , we can conclude that @xmath405 thus , by replacing this new integral in definition ( [ h1 ] ) and using that @xmath406 for all @xmath407 , we have @xmath408 now , it can be seen by using ( [ a - decomp ] ) and certain telescopic cancelations of the functions @xmath409 that @xmath410 thus , from ( [ esths ] ) it follows @xmath411 hence , using ( [ boman tree ] ) , @xmath412 finally , we have already mentioned that the functions @xmath413 and @xmath414 defined in ( [ h - decomp ] ) are supported , respectively , in the pairwise disjoint sets @xmath333 and @xmath278 .",
    "thus , combining ( [ p02 ] ) and ( [ p02 + ] ) , we have that for any @xmath301 , where @xmath302 or @xmath303 , @xmath415 proving ( [ p12 ] ) .",
    "properties @xmath416 , @xmath218 , and @xmath417 in the statement of this lemma follows by using the construction of the partition .",
    "indeed , the first two properties follow by replacing @xmath216 by @xmath418 and @xmath374 by @xmath419 in the first step .",
    "the third property follows from the facts that @xmath420 for all @xmath297 and @xmath421 , so we do not modify the orthogonality obtained in the previous step , and @xmath422 the rest of the proof follows by mimicking the first step .    [",
