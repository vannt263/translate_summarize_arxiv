    "ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 is a high mass x - ray binary hosting a b0 ve star with an equatorial outflowing disk .",
    "the companion is orbited by a compact object with an orbital period of 26.496 days ( e.g. , casares et al .",
    "ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 is detected up to gev and tev gamma - rays ( albert et al .",
    "2006 ; abdo et al . 2009 ; acciari et al . 2009 ; hadasch et al .",
    "2012 ) , and the non - thermal spectral energy distribution is dominated by high energy photons .",
    "two short ( @xmath1 0.1 s ) and highly luminous ( @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 ) thermal flares were detected recently from the direction of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 ( barthelmy et al . 2008 ; burrows et al .",
    "2012 ) , giving support to the hypothesis that the compact object in ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  is a ( at least internally ) highly magnetized neutron star ( torres et al . 2012 ; papitto et al . 2012 ) . besides the orbital period of 26.496 days , and other short - timescale variability ( see e.g. , paredes et al .",
    "2007 ) , ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  is known to have a long - term ( 1667 days ) superorbital modulation .",
    "the latter was first discovered in radio ( paredes 1987 ; gregory 1989 ; gregory 1999 ; gregory 2002 ) , and then observed in h@xmath4 emission line ( zamanov et al .",
    "1999 ) , x - rays ( li et al . 2012 ; chernyakova et al .",
    "2012 ) , gev ( ackermann et al .",
    "2013 ) , and hinted at tev ( li et al .",
    "2012 ; torres et al .",
    "2012 ) . the possible origin of this 1667 days superorbital",
    "modulation could be the precession of the be disk ( lipunov & nazin 1994 ) , the beat frequency between the orbital and precessional rates in a microquasar scenario ( massi & jaron 2013 ) , or the cyclic variability in the be star envelope .",
    "the last interpretation seems the most natural , since the h@xmath4 emission line varies on the same period and it is well known for the be stars that the size of the circumstellar disk grows as the equivalent width of h@xmath4 increases ( e.g. , hanushik , kozok & kaizer , 1988 ) . in the maximum of the equivalent width of h@xmath4 , the x - ray as well as @xmath5-ray emission are enhanced ( li et al .",
    "2012 ; ackermann et al .",
    "2013 ) . the orbital phase of the x - ray peaks from ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  varies from 0.35 to 0.75 along the superorbital period , consistently leading the radio peaks by 0.2 orbital phase ( chernyakova et al .",
    "the different origin regions of x - ray and radio emission could lead to the observed phase lag .",
    "the observed multiwavelength variabilities in superorbital timescale were discussed in the scenario of a neutron star switching between ejector and propeller states by torres et al .",
    "( 2012 ) and papitto et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "black hole composed microquasars manifest themselves in five classical spectral x - ray states ( van der klis 1994 ; tanaka & lewin 1995 ; tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ; esin et al .",
    "1997 ) : the high / soft ( hs ) state , the low / hard ( lh ) state , the quiescent state , the very high ( vh ) state , and the intermediate state .",
    "these spectral states were regrouped by mcclintock & remillard ( 2006 ) as thermal ",
    "dominant ( td ) , hard x - ray , quiescent , steep powerlaw ( spl ) , and intermediate states . from an observational perspective , an optically thick steady jet with flat ( radio spectral index @xmath6 ) or inverted ( @xmath7 ) radio component is usually seen when in the hard x - ray state ( a power law spectrum with index 1.5 @xmath8 2.1 in x - rays , mcclintock & remillard 2006 ) , and an optically thin transient jet ( @xmath9 ) is associated with the overall hard to soft state transition ( fender et al . 2004 ; fender et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in the hypothesis of ls",
    "i  + 61@xmath0303  being a microquasar , the explanation for the short thermal flares that have been detected from the region of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  must be the spatial superposition of a magnetar with a gamma - ray binary , however unlikely . in this hypothesis ,",
    "zimmermann & massi ( 2012 ) expected a steady jet ( @xmath7 ) in the hard x - ray state of the source , thus characterized by a power law with index 1.5 @xmath8 1.8 and a cutoff at high energies . a transient jet ( with @xmath9 )",
    "would on the contrary be expected in the spl state of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 , showing an x - ray slope of @xmath10 2.4 .",
    "these seem very simplified assumptions , given that such an spl state is poorly characterized .",
    "mcclintock & remillard ( 2006 ) note that many bh binaries could be radio quiet during this phase , and moreover , such state seems often described by high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath11 times the eddington level ) and the detection of a thermal component or qpos ; all of which are clearly not the case of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  ( li et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "although gbi radio data showed spectral index transitions ( massi & kaufman bernad , 2009 ) , the photon index of integral observations was found to be compatible with a low hard state ( chernyakova et al .",
    "2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "2010 ) at all times .",
    "only in one occasion the photon index was @xmath12 ( chernyakova et al .",
    "however , the large error bars ( due to little exposure ) introduced a large uncertainty .",
    "zimmermann & massi ( 2012 ) demonstrated that averaging the integral data over too large orbital and superorbital phase ranges can result in a dominant low hard state and smear out the spl state .",
    "this effect , they posed , is what explains the hard spectra all along the orbit in the ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  system , and which led to the inconsistence between data and their predictions . here , using integral observations that double the size of our previous analysis ( zhang et al .",
    "2010 ) and two years more data than in chernyakova et al .",
    "( 2012 ) we can separate in orbital and superorbital phases and test these ideas .",

    "all of the spectral analysis is performed using xspec 12.8.1 ; uncertainties are given at the 1@xmath14 confidence level for one single parameter of interest .",
    "we have also considered radio data from nasa / nrao green bank interferometer ( gbi ) database .",
    "the radio data set , the same as the one used by massi & kaufman bernad ( 2009 ) and zimmermann & massi ( 2012 ) , covers ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  at @xmath152.25 ghz and @xmath16 8.3 ghz for 6.7 years in three periods of mjd 49379.97550174.710 , mjd 50410.04451664.879 and mjd 51798.33351823.441 . the radio spectral index @xmath17 and its error @xmath18",

    "the orbital phase of an x - ray binary system represents a unique location of the compact object in the orbit . the compact object will encounter a similar physical environment ( e.g. magnetic field , mass density , accretion rate , etc . ) in the same orbital phase if the properties of companion star are stable , which will presumably lead to a repetitive pattern of orbital emissions .",
    "long - term stability of the x - ray orbital lightcurve is observed in ls 5039 ( kishishita et al .",
    "unlike ls 5039 , hosting an o star with a relative stable stellar wind , ls  i  + 61@xmath0303 s companion is a be star with circumstellar disk variability , which presumably gives rise to the superorbital period .",
    "because of the different configuration of the circumstellar disk along the superorbital period , the physical environment in each orbit is different even for the same orbital phase . consequently , we observe variable orbital emission from ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  along the superorbital period in all frequencies ( paredes 1987 ; gregory 1989 ; torres et al .",

    "1997 ; gregory 2002 ; chernyakova et al .",
    "we have detected the drift of the peak flux and spectral index in radio data , consistent with the results in gregory ( 2002 ) and chernyakova et al .",
    "from superorbital phase @xmath33 0.6 to @xmath33 1.5 , the orbital phase of the radio peak flux ( both 2.25 ghz and 8.3 ghz data show a similar evolution , see fig .",
    "3 ) is linearly drifting from orbital phase @xmath33 0.5 to @xmath33 0.95 .",
    "the linear drift of the spectral index is less evident , but clearly shifted earlier by @xmath33 0.1 in orbital phase compared to the flux ( fig 3 , right bottom panel ) . because of the scarce orbital coverage of integral along the superorbital period ( fig .",
    "2 , bottom left panel ) , we are unable to explore the presence of a peak flux drift in hard x - rays yet .",
    "massi & kaufman bernad ( 2009 ) claimed that the periodic radio orbital outbursts consisted of two peaks .",
    "we pose here that the two - peak structure is related to the drift of radio peak flux along the superorbital period .",
    "3 of massi & kaufman bernad ( 2009 ) shows the radio orbital lightcurve during superorbital phase 0.00.1 , in which the authors claimed two peaks at orbital phase 0.69 and 0.82 .",
    "but in our fig .",
    "3 , right top panel , it is clear that the orbital phase of radio peaks drifts from @xmath330.7 to @xmath330.8 during superorbital phase 0.00.1 . thus , to explore drifts in detail , we display the lightcurves of 2.25 ghz ( top panel ) , 8.3 ghz ( middle panel ) and the radio index ( bottom panel ) during superorbital phase 0.00.1 in fig .",
    "4 , where each orbit is noted with a different color .",
    "the radio data cover more than one superorbital period , from superorbital phases @xmath333.6 to @xmath335.1 ; the data in the superorbitally folded bin 0.00.1 was gathered in two passages corresponding to superorbital phase 4.04.1 and 5.05.1 .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",
    "4 . in the right panel of fig .",
    "4 we show the corresponding folded orbital lightcurve in superorbital phase 0.00.1 , similarly to fig . 3 of massi & kaufman bernad ( 2009 ) , but keeping the different color for the different orbits .",
    "the phases of the reported two peaks ( massi & kaufman bernad 2009 ) are indicated with dashed black lines . in fig .",
    "4 , right top and middle panel , it is apparent to the eye that the phase of peak flux in 2.25 ghz and 8.3 ghz is drifting in each orbit .",
    "the orbital lightcurve depicted in green is peaking around orbital phase @xmath33 0.69 , which is the first peak reported in massi & kaufman bernad ( 2009 ) , while several orbits later , the black - colored lightcurve is peaking at orbital phase @xmath33 0.82 , which is near the second peak reported .",
    "thus , folded in superorbital phase ( 0.00.1 ) , the two peaks in fig .",
    "3 of massi & kaufman bernad ( 2009 ) may actually be a superposition of single peaks from different orbits .",
    "similarly , this orbital peak drifting may also have effects in fig .",
    "5 of massi & kaufman bernad ( 2009 ) , where the data is also folded over a bin of 0.1 superorbital phase .",
    "thus , only the lightcurve of each individual orbit , or the orbital lightcurve folded in a narrower superorbital phase that avoids the orbital peak - drifting effect is suitable to explore the reality of the double peak structure , which is here put in question .",
    "we have tested one of the methods proposed to identify the microquasar nature of the ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  system : namely , that it is in spl state when the radio index @xmath9 and in low hard state when @xmath22 , and that using large orbital and superorbital phase ranges mixes these states smearing out the state transitions signatures ( zimmermann & massi 2012 ) .",
    "the latter has been claimed as the reason of the non - detection of significant spectral variations in the integral data analyzed so far . here , with a significantly increased dataset",
    ", we have introduced the orbital / superorbital phase space and extracted the x - ray spectrum for the corresponding specific cuts , avoiding averaging data over a too large superorbital range .",
    "ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  shows a hard spectrum ( single power law with no cutoff , @xmath25=1.49@xmath26 , see table 1 ) when @xmath9 , which is inconsistent with the spl state interpretation of zimmermann & massi ( 2012 ) stated above .",
    "as commented in the introduction , such a clear cut distinction between states based on the radio index seems unlikely .",
    "the spl state itself is not an  intermediate state \" that lies between soft and hard states , though transitions pass through spl frequently ( mcclintock & remillard 2006 ; zhang et al .",
    "it may also be unrealistic to think that optically thin radio emission is confined to the spl state only .",
    "if a hard to soft state transition does not pass through an spl state ( e.g. , the 2011 outburst of h 1743 - 322 during which the photon index is always below 2.4 , zhou et al .",
    "2012 ) or optically thin radio flares appear in other intermediate states but not in spl state , the x - ray photon index will not go above 2.4 during optically thin radio emission .",
    "thus , the x - ray spectrum during @xmath9 might be a mixture of a spl state or transitions to spl states ( e.g. see the cases of xte j1650 - 500 , corbel et al .",
    "2004 ; gx 339 - 4 , gallo et al .",
    "2004 ; xte j1859 + 226 , brocksopp et al .",
    "2002 , corbel et al .",
    "2004 ) , and intermediate states when optically thin radio emissions locate out of spl states .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that most of the observation time in integral indeed has a concurrent @xmath9 ( at the same orbital and superorbital phase ) indicates that the most likely alternative is simply that there is no state transition at all , something also supported by the low x - ray flux at all times .",
    "we have also shown hints for the superorbital variability of ls  i  + 61@xmath0303  in hard x - rays , and that the appearance of a double peak structure in the radio lightcurve of superobitally folded data can be accommodated by a drift of a single peak in an orbital basis .",

    "<S> the hard x - ray index is found to be uncorrelated with the radio index ( non - simultaneously ) measured at the same orbital and superorbital phases . in particular , the absence of an x - ray spectrum softening during the periods of negative radio index does not favor a simple interpretation of the radio index variations in terms of changes of state in a microquasar . </S>",
    "<S> we uncover hints for the superorbital variability in the hard x - ray flux , in phase with the superorbital modulation in soft x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> an orbital phase drift of radio peak flux and index along the superorbital period is observed in the radio data . </S>",
    "<S> we explore its influence on a previously reported double peak structure of radio orbital lightcurve , posing it as a plausible explanation . </S>"
