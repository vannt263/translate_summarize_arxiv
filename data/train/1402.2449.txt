    "the extension of chpt to systems with a larger baryonic number was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the chiral counting is applied to the calculation of the multi - nucleon potential . in these cases one also has to face the problem associated with the infrared enhancement associated with the small nucleon kinetic energies , which requires to resum the infinite string of diagrams due to the iteration of intermediate multi - nucleon states .",

    "@xcite to nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) scattering has been phenomenologically successful @xcite . however , the sensitivity of the results on the values of the cutoff taken to solve the associated lippmann - schwinger equation for the iteration of two - nucleon intermediate states has given rise to a flurry of publications , whose fair and comprehensive consideration is beyond this introduction . for more detailed accounts on this respect",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "we continue here the application of the @xmath1 method @xcite to @xmath0 scattering extending the previous work of refs .",
    "@xcite . for this method",
    "the dynamical input is not the @xmath0 potential but the discontinuity of a @xmath0 partial - wave amplitude along the left - hand - cut ( lhc ) , which is denoted in the following by @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the center of mass ( c.m . )",
    "three - momentum squared of a @xmath0 state .",
    "in other words , @xmath7 is the imaginary part of a @xmath0 partial - wave amplitude along the lhc , that extends for real @xmath6 with @xmath8 , being @xmath9 the pion ( @xmath10 ) mass .",
    "the function @xmath7 is due to the multi - exchange of pions driving the finite - range nuclear forces , while in a low - energy effective field theory the short - range nuclear forces are accounted for by local interactions of zero range that do not contribute to @xmath7 for finite @xmath6 .",
    "the two - nucleon irreducible contributions to @xmath7 are amenable to a straightforward chpt expansion , in much the same way as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the calculation of the chiral @xmath0 potential .",
    "however , @xmath7 has also contributions from two - nucleon reducible diagrams but , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , these contributions require to cut all the pion lines simultaneously when iterating one - pion exchange ( ope ) . in this way",
    ", when including an extra @xmath0 intermediate state in the iteration of the unitarity two - nucleon diagrams their contribution to @xmath7 starts further away in the lhc .",
    "it then results that the @xmath11th iteration of two - nucleon intermediate states , which at least requires @xmath12 ope ladders , gives contribution to @xmath7 only for @xmath13 .",
    "this makes that its relevance for physical values of @xmath6 ( @xmath14 ) in the low - energy region clearly dismisses with increasing @xmath11 . as a result , because of the chiral expansion together with this other effect that numerically suppresses the proliferation of two - nucleon reducible diagrams in the calculation of @xmath7 , one can determine this function reliably in chpt . , and it does not occur to any other `` component '' of a @xmath0 partial wave amplitude . ]    in refs .",
    "@xcite the @xmath1 method was solved with @xmath7 calculated at leading order ( lo ) from ope , while in ref .",
    "@xcite the nlo contributions to @xmath7 were also included .",
    "these contributions comprise two - nucleon irreducible two - pion exchange and once - iterated ope , whose sum gives the leading two - pion exchange ( tpe ) .",
    "reference  @xcite obtained a clear improvement in the reproduction of the phase shifts and mixing angles given by the nijmegen partial - wave analysis ( pwa ) @xcite as compared with the lo study , so that a global and rather good agreement is achieved at nlo .",
    "we want to give one step forward and consider here the next - to - next - to - leading ( nnlo ) contributions to @xmath7 , which are given by the imaginary part along the lhc of the two - nucleon irreducible tpe diagrams with a nlo @xmath15 vertex in heavy - baryon chpt ( hbchpt ) @xcite .",
    "we see that the chiral expansion within our approach is well behaved , so that there is a steady improvement in the reproduction of the nijmegen pwa results when passing from lo to nlo and then to nnlo , where a quite good reproduction of the nijmegen pwa is finally obtained .",
    "this is accomplished in a progressive and smooth way , without violent variations in the results obtained at every order .",
    "scattering by ref .",
    "@xcite that uses a modified version of the @xmath1 method by truncating the integrals along the lhc with a sharp cutoff . ] in addition , we deal with convergent integrals by taking enough number of subtractions so that the above referred regulator dependence that arises when solving the lippmann - schwinger equation with a chiral @xmath0 potential is avoided by construction in our approach .",
    "an interesting outcome from our study is that we corroborate the long - range correlations between the effective range and scattering length for each of the @xmath0 @xmath2 waves , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , when only the corresponding scattering length is taken as experimental input .",
    "these correlations , first noticed in ref .",
    "@xcite , were also obtained in the nlo @xmath1 study of ref .",
    "@xcite , and within our approach they are deduced solely from basic principles of @xmath0 partial - wave amplitudes , namely , chiral symmetry , unitarity and analyticity .",
    "they are typically fulfilled at the level of around a @xmath18 when comparing with the experimental values for the effective ranges .",
    "we should say that we can proceed further and include more subtractions , so that we can implement within our formalism the exact values of the effective ranges , something not possible in the tight scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite .    regarding the subtraction constants we elaborate below a chiral power counting for them , by taking into account the change in their values due to variations in the subtraction point .",
    "we show that at nlo and nnlo in the calculation of @xmath7 one properly takes twice - subtracted dispersion relations ( drs ) .",
    "nevertheless , on top of this criterion we impose that one should obtain the proper threshold behavior for higher partial waves , as well as having meaningful solutions of the integral equations ( ies ) that result from the corresponding drs .",
    "these two requirements often imply the necessity of taking more than two subtractions in the corresponding drs relations . regarding the number of subtractions used to guarantee the threshold behavior for higher partial waves we use here the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , so that partial waves with orbital angular momentum @xmath19 and mixing partial waves with total angular momentum @xmath20 vanish at threshold as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "this requires to take at least @xmath23 or @xmath24 subtractions , in order , with @xmath25 or @xmath26 free parameters , respectively .",
    "but at the end , as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , none or only one of the resulting subtraction constants for a given partial wave with @xmath27 ( or @xmath28 for a mixing wave ) is necessary to reproduce data .",
    "this interesting point , which allows to treat easily higher partial waves , is called in ref .",
    "@xcite the principle of maximal smoothness .    in our study",
    "we have also paid special attention to the issue concerning the impact on the results of the rather large size of the nlo @xmath15 counterterms , typically denoted by @xmath29 @xcite , which first appear in the calculation of @xmath7 at nnlo .",
    "it is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite that the @xmath15 monomials , proportional to the @xmath29 counterterms , produce a too large contribution to the @xmath0 potential at medium and short distances when it is calculated at nnlo in dimensional regularization , which worsens the properties of the chiral expansion .",
    "because of this ref .",
    "@xcite argued to better use a cutoff regularization to calculate the nnlo potential , or equivalently , to cut the energy spectral representation of the nnlo @xmath0 potential at around the chiral symmetry breaking scale .",
    "this last point would be equivalent to truncate the full extent of the lhc in our dispersive integrals . however , it is interesting to remark that we do not need to do that in order to obtain a good reproduction of the nijmegen pwa when employing @xmath7 determined up to nnlo .",
    "in fact , we observe that the definitive improvement of our results compared with the born approximation does not arise by modifying the two - nucleon irreducible diagrams at nnlo , but by performing the iteration of two - nucleon unitarity diagrams as required by analyticity and unitarity in a well - defined way .    after this introduction",
    "we review the @xmath1 method for coupled and uncoupled partial waves in sec .",
    "[ unformalism ] .",
    "the function @xmath7 , calculated in chpt up to nnlo , is discussed in sec .",

    "sections [ 1s0 ] to [ gi5w ] are devoted to discuss the application of the @xmath1 method to the different @xmath0 partial waves up to @xmath30 .",
    "there it is shown that a quite good reproduction of the nijmegen pwa phase shifts and mixing angles results . in these sections",
    "we also compare with the born approximation for higher partial waves and discuss on the relative importance of the different contributions to @xmath7 . our concluding remarks are given in sec .",
    "finally , we discuss in appendix [ appen : vs ] a method to calculate higher order shape parameters of the @xmath0 @xmath2 waves .",
    "a detailed presentation of the formalism for the @xmath1 method @xcite can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we only reproduce the main facets of the approach .",
    "an uncoupled @xmath0 partial wave is written as the quotient of two functions , where the numerator is the function @xmath31 and the denominator is @xmath32 .",
    "then , one writes @xmath33 with @xmath34 the corresponding @xmath0 partial wave in the c.m . frame . in the following we use the spectroscopic notation and denote by @xmath35 the different @xmath0 partial waves with @xmath2 the total spin , @xmath36 the orbital angular momentum and @xmath24 the total angular momentum .",
    "the point for the splitting of @xmath34 in two functions is because @xmath31 has only lhc while @xmath32 has only right - hand cut ( rhc ) , also called unitarity cut .",
    "the following expressions for the discontinuities of the functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 along their respective cuts then arise , @xmath37 here @xmath38 and it represents the onset of the lhc for @xmath39 due to ope , and @xmath40 is the phase space factor @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the nucleon mass .",
    "the first of the relations in eq .",
    "is a consequence of elastic unitarity for a @xmath0 partial wave , which reads @xmath43 in terms of @xmath44 this can be recast simply as @xmath45 with this normalization the relation between the @xmath46 and @xmath2 matrices is @xmath47 .",
    "the discontinuity of a @xmath0 partial wave @xmath34 along the lhc is given by @xmath48 , which directly implies the second expression in eq .  .",
    "standard drs for the functions @xmath32 and @xmath31 are derived in ref .",
    "@xcite under the assumption that the function @xmath32 does not diverge faster than a polynomial of degree @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "then for @xmath51 one can write @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the subtraction point .",
    "notice that the same number of subtractions is taken both in @xmath32 and @xmath31 . the argument given in ref .",
    "@xcite makes use of the fact that @xmath54 and @xmath34 , because of unitarity , vanish at least as @xmath55 for @xmath56 . as a result",
    "if @xmath32 diverges at most as @xmath57 then @xmath31 does not diverge faster than @xmath58 . here",
    "we take into account the sugawara and kanazawa theorem @xcite , as a consequence of which any function like @xmath32 or @xmath31 with only one cut of infinite extent along the real axis has the same limit for @xmath50 in any direction of the @xmath6-complex plane .",
    "in addition , it is clear from eq .   and the standard theory of drs @xcite , that we can take different values for the corresponding subtraction points for each function separately .",
    "indeed , for many partial waves we will take the subtractions for the function @xmath32 in two different subtraction points , one at @xmath59 and the other at @xmath60 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that we impose the normalization @xmath61 which can always be done by dividing simultaneously @xmath32 and @xmath31 by a constant without altering their ratio corresponding to @xmath34 , eq .  .",
    "in this way , one subtraction for @xmath32 is always taken at @xmath59 in order to guarantee straightforwardly the normalization eq .  .",
    "to solve @xmath32 in terms of the input @xmath7 and the subtraction constants we substitute in eq .",
    "the expression for @xmath31 into the dr of @xmath32 , so that we end with the following ie for @xmath32 with @xmath39 , @xmath62 the key point of the method is to solve this ie numerically which provides the knowledge of @xmath32 for @xmath39 .",
    "once @xmath32 is known along the lhc we can calculate all the functions @xmath32 , @xmath31 and @xmath34 in the whole @xmath6-complex plane . to obtain",
    "@xmath32 one can use eq .   and for @xmath31 one has the second of the drs in eq .  .",
    "once @xmath31 and @xmath32 are known one can calculate @xmath34 by applying eq .  .",
    "notice also that the integrations along the rhc in eq .   can be done algebraically in terms of the function @xmath63 the term @xmath64 is necessary for negative @xmath6 or @xmath65 , with the prescription @xmath66 .",
    "we can calculate the other rhc integrals of eq .   with higher powers of the factor @xmath67 in the denominator by simple differentiation with respect to @xmath53 of the function @xmath68 , @xmath69      for the case of the triplet partial waves with total angular momentum @xmath24 we have the mixing between the partial waves with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , except for the @xmath72 .",
    "in this case we denote the different coupled partial waves by @xmath73 with @xmath74 , where 1 labels the lower angular momentum @xmath75 and 2 the higher one @xmath76 .",
    "all of them are gathered together in the @xmath77 matrix @xmath34 , in terms of which the @xmath2-matrix reads @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the @xmath80 unit matrix , @xmath81 is the mixing angle , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the phase shifts for the channels with orbital angular momentum @xmath23 and @xmath84 , in this order .",
    "equation corresponds to the stapp parameterization @xcite .",
    "now , the @xmath1 method explained for the uncoupled waves in sec .",
    "is extended to the coupled channel case @xcite by writing down three @xmath1 equations , one for every @xmath73 [ notice that because of time reversal @xmath85 .",
    "the main difference with respect to the uncoupled case is that now the discontinuity along the rhc of the inverse of @xmath73 does not simply correspond to @xmath86 , but it also contains information on the other coupled partial waves . in the following",

    "[ upw ] is also in order here .",
    "namely , we can use different subtraction points for the functions @xmath90 and @xmath91 , as well as to use even different subtraction points in the same function , as we will do below for @xmath90 .",
    "an uncoupled @xmath0 partial wave with @xmath19 should vanish at threshold as @xmath97 .",
    "similarly for a coupled partial wave we have the analogous results but in terms of @xmath98 , with @xmath74 . as discussed in ref .",

    "<S> we study nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) scattering by applying the @xmath1 method in chiral perturbation theory up to next - to - next - to - leading ( nnlo ) order in the calculation of the imaginary part of the @xmath0 partial - wave amplitudes along the left - hand - cut , which is the dynamical input for this approach . </S>",
    "<S> a quite good reproduction of the nijmegen partial - wave analysis phase shifts and mixing angles is obtained , which implies a steady improvement in the accurateness achieved by increasing the chiral order in the calculation of the dynamical input . </S>",
    "<S> a power counting for the subtraction constants is established , which is appropriate for those subtractions attached to both the left- and right - hand cuts . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss that it is not necessary to modify the @xmath0 chiral potential at nnlo to agree with data , but instead one should perform the iteration of two - nucleon intermediate states to finally achieve analytic and unitarity @xmath0 partial - wave amplitudes in a well - defined way . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirm at nnlo the long - range correlations between the @xmath0 @xmath2-wave effective ranges and scattering lengths , when employing only once - subtracted dispersion relations , that holds up to around 10% when compared with experimental values .    </S>",
