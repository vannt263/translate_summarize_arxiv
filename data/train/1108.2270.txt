    "it is even plausible that low - mass smbhs gain most of their mass by tidal disruption events @xcite .",
    "therefore it is important to infer the stellar capture rate for as many astrophysical systems of interest as possible , for all relevant smbh masses using both theoretical and when possible numerical approaches . in order to avoid confusion regarding the terminology of the capture and disruption rate we note that the former expression is used for the general number of stars / particles which are either swallowed as a whole or disrupted outside the event horizon in a given time , i.e. independent of the mass of the smbh . the latter one is explicitly used for situations in which stars are tidally disrupted before they would enter the event horizon .",

    ". if for example the initial mass of a smbh is strongly under - massive with respect to the @xmath7 relation , the feeding from tidal disruptions events alone might not be sufficient enough to bring it close to the observed relation for galaxies at @xmath124 .",
    "on the other hand if stellar disruptions dominate the growth of the least - massive black holes there is no obvious reason why these black holes should follow the @xmath7 relation . by now assuming the @xmath7 relation to be established for a primordial gas rich globular cluster ( or galactic nucleus ) , which nowadays remains in isolation and without gas to drive new star formation , the resulting imbh ( or smbh , at least if it is not too massive ) should nowadays be more massive than expected from the @xmath7 relation due to subsequent tidal disruption events .",

    "tidal disruption events might therefore have implications for the search and existence of imbhs in globular clusters .",
    "of course in order to proof its relevance for imbhs , the use of the @xmath7 relation in the extrapolation formalism from numerical simulations to galactic nuclei ( appendix  [ appendixb ] ) must be replaced by more direct observational data because the extrapolated values strongly depend on the validity of this scaling relation .",
    "tidal disruption events complicate the understanding of the relevant processes which drive the evolution of galaxies and their central black holes . especially as the impact of disruption events for the mass growth of black holes strongly depends on their initial mass .",

    "the capture rate for rotation - supported models like rotating bulges or pseudo bulges should be enhanced compared to nonrotating models .",
    "these objects are expected to form from rotating bar instabilities @xcite and the relative velocities between two or more particles are generally lower .",
    "therefore two - body relaxation processes would be even stronger .",
    "+ however the overall picture of black hole growth across cosmic times by tidal disruptions might be complicated even more due to the dynamical evolution of the density profile and a variable fraction of the initial stellar mass which finally becomes accreted by the black hole .",
    "our conclusions regarding the growth history of imbhs and smbhs events should only hold for density profiles resembling those of our simulations and by assuming that a fraction of one half ( or more ) of the initial stellar mass becomes accreted by the black hole @xcite .",

    "second , very small black holes might temporarily generate luminosities far in excess of the eddington limit @xcite and most of the remaining matter may finally be blown away instead of being swallowed by the black hole .",
    "this would invalidate our conclusions regarding the growth history of small black holes where we assumed one half of the stellar mass to be accreted .",

    "the feeding by stars from density profiles similar to the ones computed here bears no implications for establishing scaling relations between very massive black holes and their host galaxies .",

    "the growth history of the least massive black holes might be governed by more than one feeding mode ( gas and star accretion ) .",
    "this might have implications for the search and existence of potential imbhs in globular clusters and minor galaxies . assuming these scaling relations ( e.g. the @xmath7 relation ) to be established shortly after their primordial gas rich phase billions of years ago",
    ", the nuclear black holes would continue their growth by the subsequent disruption of stars .",
    "depending on the initial conditions , the black hole masses could nowadays lie well above the predicted values of the @xmath7 relation as long as the globular cluster remains in isolation should therefore not increase . ] . on the other hand the continuous monitoring and search for tidal disruption events in globular clusters ( e.g. in the virgo cluster ) should constrain the fraction of those clusters hosting a central imbh . by assuming 25000 globular clusters with a central black hole in the mass range @xmath156 in the virgo cluster of galaxies , there should be one disruption event every @xmath157 years . finally the performed computations indicate that the growth history of imbhs and low mass smbhs is diverse and not only governed by one process , i.e gas accretion",
    ". however it needs to be pointed out that there exist effects which might reduce the fraction of stellar matter which finally becomes accreted by the black hole .",
    "we assumed one half of a captured star s mass to be swallowed @xcite , whereas a smaller fraction would result in even slower growth rates .",
    "thus our conclusions regarding the growth history may change if small black holes gather only tiny fractions of the total initial stellar mass .",
    "future studies can use the reported capture rate @xmath158 to deduce more realistic growth rates @xmath159 by taking more appropriate values for the fraction of accreted matter into account .",
    "it would also be interesting to extend these studies to the most - massive black holes as well as constraining the capture rate for different profiles .",

    "the black hole influence radius is @xmath195 times smaller than the dynamical radius .",
    "subsequently the astrophysical dynamical timescale @xmath196 of the matter distribution within the influence radius of the astrophysical galaxy must be computed for the black hole of given mass by using @xmath174 $ ] and @xmath197 $ ] from @xcite .",

    "we assume all stars to have the same mass @xmath198 .",
    "a coarse estimate for the number of stars can be computed by : @xmath199 the choice of @xmath198 depends on the stellar mass function and seems to be a reasonable assumption for galactic nuclei where mass segregation is important @xcite .",
    "the factor 100 accounts for the fraction of bulge mass to black hole mass in accordance with our simulations .",
    "5 .   finally the disruption rate of stars by massive black holes can be evaluated . in a first step the numerically inferred number of captures @xmath102 per n - body time unit ( table  [ tablen=4 ] ) must be normalized to the relevant crossing time @xmath200 ( in n - body time units ) at the influence radius of the black hole .",
    "this dimensionless number must afterwards be synchronized with the relevant timescale @xmath201 of the astrophysical galaxy .",
    "consequently @xmath202 has to be divided by @xmath201 in order to obtain the number of disrupted stars within the desired physical time unit ( e.g yr , myr ) for the black hole of interest : @xmath203    our extrapolation formalism strongly depends on the @xmath7 relation .",
    "more accurate and numerous black hole measurements will improve this relation in the future .",
    "moreover we only treat errors from our simulations and neglected the intrinsic scatter of the @xmath7 relation for simplicity .",
    "direct n - body integrations are limited by a maximal computable number of particles which is orders of magnitudes lower compared to particle numbers in the nuclei of astrophysical galaxies .",
    "the extrapolation to such astrophysical settings is thus only possible if the relevant physics do not change in between .",
    "loss cone problems ( tidal capturing and/or shrinking binary black holes ) require special care @xcite . here",
    "we will show that the inequality @xmath204 is fulfilled up to smbhs of order @xmath118 and hence our result , @xmath205 , should yield realistic values when extrapolated to such black holes . for black holes",
    "much more massive , the situation might change . by assuming the radius @xmath77 at which particles can enter loss cone orbits without being scattered away through interactions with other stars to be @xmath206",

    "even though our assumptions are idealistic and not every star fulfills its plunge into the black hole from the critical radius @xmath25 , it underlines the extrapolation from our numerical simulations to realistic cores of galaxies with central black holes up to @xmath118 to be credible ."
