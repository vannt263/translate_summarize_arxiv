    "the video ( entry # 83832 , aps 65@xmath0 annual dfd meeting 2012 ) demonstrates the patterns exhibited by gravity - driven , particle - laden thin films flowing down a solid substrate .",
    "the results from three experiments are shown in the video .",
    "a finite volume of fluid mixed with particles is allowed to flow down the solid plane ; visualization is achieved from the front view and the videos have been recorded with a digital slr camera ( canon eos rebel t2i ) .",
    "the suspension consists of silicone oil , glass and ceramic beads .",
    "the ceramic beads are denser than the glass beads while both sets of particles are denser than the fluid .",
    "it is noted that both species of beads are of the same size .",
    "the substrate angle of inclination is fixed at @xmath1 while the total particle concentration , @xmath2 is fixed at @xmath3 .",
    "the series of experiments conducted aim in understanding the effect of adding a second , heavier species of beads to a slurry composed of oil and glass beads . in order to visualize the separation , if any , between the two species , the ceramic and glass beads are dyed blue and red , respectively .",
    "we introduce a dimensionless parameter , @xmath4 , defined as the ratio of the concentration of glass beads to the total concentration of particles",
    ".    the rightmost video shows a reference case wherein the suspension consists only of glass beads ( i.e. @xmath5 ) ; the relative ratio @xmath4 is decreased from 1 ( right ) to 0.75 ( center ) to 0.25 ( left ) with the addition of ceramic beads .",
    "the runtime associated with the individual videos has been fast - forwarded 6 times , in order to demonstrate the onset of flow instabilities as well as the development of fingering patterns .",
    "the choice of parameters allows the presentation of three , distinct regimes , also exhibited by an increase in particle concentration in monodisperse slurry flows . in this video , we observe the three regimes by keeping the total particle concentration constant while we add a second species of negatively buoyant beads . for large concentrations of _ ceramic _ beads ( left video , mostly blue particles ) ,",
    "the particles settle rapidly allowing the clear fluid to flow over them which results in fingering . for small concentrations of _ ceramic _ beads ( middle video , red and blue particles ) , we observe a well - mixed regime characterized by finger formation ; this regime is considered to give an unstable , transient pattern . finally , for monodisperse suspensions of _ glass _ beads i.e. no _ ceramic _ beads ( right video , red particles ) , the beads aggregate at the contact line , forming a particle - rich ridge , evident by a darker red color at the front of the flow . +   + * references *   + 1 .",
