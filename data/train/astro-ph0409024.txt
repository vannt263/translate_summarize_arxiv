    "understanding the physics of convective core overshoot is important in interpreting the color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and the luminosity functions of open star clusters , and in dating young and intermediate age stellar populations .",
    "core overshoot has several effects on stellar evolution ( see e.g. stothers 1991 ) . among the most notable are the effects on the shape of the main sequence turnoff , on the rate of evolution in the main sequence and subgiant phases , and on the ratio of total lifetimes spent in the core hydrogen burning phase and the shell hydrogen burning stage .",
    "the implications of convective core overshoot for deriving a chronology of open star clusters in the galaxy have long been recognized ( maeder & mermilliod 1981 ) .",
    "detailed comparisons of theoretical isochrones with star cluster cmds suggest the need to include convective overshoot in stellar evolution calculations .",
    "gaps in the stellar distribution near the main sequence , which are identified with the hydrogen exhaustion phase , have been observed in the cmds of open star clusters .",
    "the location and size of these gaps yield better agreement with those theoretical isochrones that admit some amount of core overshoot ( stothers & chin 1991 ; carraro et al .",

    "the purpose of this paper is to improve on the treatment of convective core overshoot in the @xmath0 isochrones ( yi et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter paper i ; kim et al .",
    "2003 , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "we focus on the mass range where convective cores begin to appear in stellar models near the main sequence .",
    "this transition region affects sensitively the morphology of isochrones and the luminosity function near the main sequence turnoff . as a result",
    ", it affects the ages derived for stellar populations based on the cmds of star clusters .",
    "it also modifies the predicted integrated spectral energy distributions of stellar populations and their derived spectral ages in studies of distant galaxies ( yi et al .",
    "2000 ) .    in view of the importance of core overshoot for intermediate age stellar populations ,",
    "we have calculated a patch to the original @xmath0 isochrones to prevent the troublesome distortions that occurred in some instances near the turnoff in the original isochrones .",
    "most of the interest in core overshoot in the grids of evolutionary tracks available in the literature has concentrated on massive stars with well developed convective cores ( maeder & meynet 1988 ; bertelli et al . 1990 ; stothers & chin 1991 ; meynet et al .",
    "1994 ) . even in the geneva grids ,",
    "in which intermediate mass evolutionary tracks have been included , no mention is made on the problems posed for isochrone construction by the narrow transition from the absence to the presence of a convective core as the mass increases ( schaller et al .",

    "( 2000 ) describe a treatment of the transition region in which the chosen critical transition mass , taken to be 1.0@xmath1 , is independent of chemical composition .",
    "it is however well - known that the mass at which a convective core first appears along the main sequence is a sensitive function of chemical composition .",
    "this result must be taken into account in any detailed comparison with observation . already , the original isochrones of papers i and ii addressed this chemical composition dependence by introducing a critical mass @xmath2 , defined as the mass above which stars continue to have a substantial convective core even after the pre - ms phase of evolution is ended .",
    "in addition to taking into account the dependence of @xmath2 on chemical composition , our new evolutionary tracks also include several improvements which are physically more realistic , as detailed in  4 .",
    "these changes are useful for chemical compositions that differ markedly from solar and for applications which require interpolation between the isochrones .    ",
    "2 summarizes the input physics and parameters used in the previous @xmath0 isochrone papers . in  3 , we discuss the physics of convective core overshoot and the procedures used to model its structural and evolutionary effects in stars .",
    "semi - empirical estimates of the extent of core overshoot based principally on the cmds of star clusters are given in  4 . in  5 , we then describe the new overshoot approach adopted in the critical mass transition region .",
    "some comparisons between observed open cluster cmd s are presented in  6 .",
    "finally , future prospects for a better physical understanding of convective core overshoot are briefly summarized in  7 .",
    "the evolutionary tracks presented in this paper were constructed using the yale stellar evolution code yrec with the same input physics and parameters as in paper i and paper ii . a more complete discussion of the choice of parameters can be found in these two papers .",
    "a useful assessment of validity of the @xmath0 stellar models and other models including a detailed comparison with observational data for stars in the pre - main sequence and early post - main sequence phases of evolution has recently been published by hillenbrand & white ( 2004 ) .",

    "the opal equation of state was taken from the work of rogers , swenson & iglesias ( 1996 ) .",

    "convective core overshoot is understood here as the presence of material motions and/or mixing beyond the canonical boundary for convection defined by the classic schwarzschild criterion ( 1906 ) .",
    "early investigations by roxburgh ( 1965 ) , who used the mixing length theory , and by saslaw & schwarzschild ( 1965 ) , who based their argument on thermodynamic grounds ( i.e. the edge of the convective core in massive stars is sharply defined in an entropy diagram ) , suggested that little overshoot takes place at the edge of convective cores .",
    "but shaviv & salpeter ( 1973 ) pointed out subsequently that if one takes into account the presence of hydrodynamic motions and turbulence , one might expect some non - negligible amount of core overshoot .",
    "more recently , zahn ( 1991 ) has discussed the complex physical interaction between convective and radiative transfer in the overshoot region .",
    "it turns out that the nature of the overshoot depends sensitively on the details of the local physics at the convective core edge . the local pclet number , which characterizes the relative importance of radiative and turbulent diffusivity , determines whether the temperature gradient in the overshoot region is adiabatic ( the situation called `` penetration '' by zahn ) , or whether the local radiative transfer dominates the energy transport . in the latter case",
    ", overshoot does not modify the stable temperature gradient beyond the schwarzschild limit , and its main effect is to cause mixing into the radiatively stable layers just outside the convective core edge .",
    "this kind of overshoot has been described as `` overmixing '' .",
    "it follows from the above discussion that a proper treatment of convective core overshoot requires a radiative hydrodynamic treatment near the convective boundary .",
    "kuhfu   ( 1986 ) has proposed a non - local treatment based on the anelastic approximation for convection and the diffusion approximation for radiation .",
    "an application of the kuhfu   theory to describe overshoot from convective stars of the upper main sequence has been made by straka et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who proposed some seismic tests to test the theory .      in the absence of a general theory of convective overshoot which would enable us to calculate the amount of core overshoot for a star of a given mass and chemical composition",
    ", a semi - empirical phenomenological approach must be used in calculations of stellar evolution .",
    "several computational schemes of various degrees of sophistication in treating the physics of overshoot have been discussed in the literature ( prather & demarque 1974 ; maeder 1975 ; maeder & meynet 1988 ; bressan , bertelli & chiosi 1981 ; bertelli et al .",
    "1990 ; straka et al .",
    "the most common parameterization of core overshoot , and the one that was adopted in the @xmath0 evolutionary tracks , is to evaluate the overshoot length in terms of the local pressure scale height @xmath16 at or across the formal edge of the convective core , where the core edge is defined by the schwarzschild ( 1906 ) criterion .",
    "the amount of core overshoot is then given by the product @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a constant parameter less than unity . in the @xmath0 models , the temperature gradient in the overshoot region",
    "was assumed to be unaffected by the overshoot , and the main result was an extension of the mixed region beyond the edge of the convectively unstable core .",
    "the present paper is primarily concerned with the calculation of core overshoot for stars with masses in the vicinity of @xmath2 , the critical mass at which a convective core makes its appearance on the main sequence .",
    "this simple parameterization of core overshoot in terms of the pressure scale height breaks down as the convective core vanishes because @xmath16 @xmath19 @xmath20 as @xmath21 @xmath19 0 ( see e.g. wuchterl & feuchtinger 1998 ) .",
    "roxburgh s integral constraint is another way to quantify the amount of core overshoot since it provides an upper limit to the radial extent of convective penetration ( roxburgh 1989,1998 ; zahn 1991 ; canuto 1997 ) . because it only provides an upper limit , the value of roxburgh s integral must in practice be multiplied by an adjustable parameter to achieve good agreement with observations of cluster cmds .",
    "this free parameter , which is analogous to the @xmath18 parameter discussed above , was evaluated for the open cluster ngc 6819 to be about 0.5 ( rosvick & vandenberg 1998 ) .",
    "it is often desirable to combine the theoretical limit to core overshoot set by roxburgh s integral constraint and the convenience of the pressure scale height approach in stellar evolution calculations .",
    "recent examples can be found in the work of woo & demarque ( 2001 ) and di mauro et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . the woo - demarque approach , however , requires a much finer stellar mass grid of evolutionary tracks , than is available for the @xmath0 isochrones .",
    "this is because the transition in the woo - demarque treatment takes place in a mass range narrower than the mass grid size available in the @xmath0 database ( 0.1@xmath1 ) .",
    "observations of star cluster cmds provide a useful guide in evaluating @xmath18 for a large grid of stellar evolutionary tracks .",
    "the semi - empirical approach of comparing synthetic cmds based on theoretical isochrones to the cmds and luminosity functions of observed star clusters is adopted .",
    "studies of star cluster cmds indicate that @xmath18 @xmath22 0.2@xmath16 for clusters with ages in the range 1 - 3 gyr , with turnoff masses @xmath23 in the range 1.4 - 2.0 @xmath1 , and that os @xmath22 0.0 - 0.1@xmath16 for older clusters ( 4 - 6 gyr and @xmath23 = 1.1 - 1.3 @xmath1 ) ( stothers 1991 ; demarque , sarajedini & guo 1994 ; kozhurina - platais et al .",
    "this statement is compatible with the conclusion discussed in the previous section that if the radial extent of core overshoot is expressed in terms of the local pressure height at the core edge , the effective value of the parameter @xmath18 must decrease as the core radius decreases .",
    "there are other independent ways to determine @xmath18 .",
    "detached eclipsing binaries in which the components have convective cores are consistent with some core overshoot , of the order of 0.2@xmath16 for stars with fully developed convective cores ( ribas , jordi , & gimnez 2000 ) .",
    "it is important to remember , however , that such overshoot estimates depend on all other features of the standard stellar models being correct .",
    "there are several uncertainties in stellar models that may affect our core overshoot estimates",
    ". the boundaries of convective regions in stellar models can be sensitive to the adopted composition parameters , such as helium abundance , [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath7/fe ] , all of which entail uncertainties . and",
    "even if the composition were perfectly well - known , stothers & chin ( 1991 ) have pointed out the high sensitivity of core overshoot to the adopted opacities .",
    "for example , increases in radiative opacities from the opal group ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) over the previous generation los alamos opacity library ( huebner et al .",
    "1977 ) decrease the need for overshoot in comparison with observational data .",
    "internal rotation may also play a role in core overshoot .",
    "deupree ( 1998 , 2000 ) has considered the combined effects of rotation and convective overshoot in massive stars , which have large convective cores , based on the two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "rotation could be significant in the case of less massive stars as well ( in the range @xmath24 ) , with shear - driven turbulence near the edge of the convective core mixing material from the helium - enriched core into the envelope ( e.g. see rotating star models by pinsonneault et al .",
    "rotationally induced mixing could thus in effect enlarge the size of the mixed convective core .    by providing a powerful independent way of probing the stellar interior",
    ", stellar seismology will provide new tools to measure the extent of convective regions and overshooting .",
    "the promise of seismology will be briefly discussed in the last section of this paper .",
    "guided by the observational studies mentioned above , the published @xmath0 isochrones were constructed assuming @xmath18 = 0.2 in stars with well developed convective cores . for convenience , and also based on the available observational data , the isochrones were divided into two classes , i.e. young isochrones ( @xmath9 2 gyr ) , in which full core overshoot was taken into account , and old isochrones ( @xmath25 3 gyr ) in which no overshoot ( i.e. @xmath18 = 0.0 ) was included regardless of the stellar mass . by inspection of the no overshoot evolutionary tracks , we first found the critical mass @xmath2 above which stars continue to have a substantial convective core even after the pre - ms phase is ended .",
    "the critical mass @xmath2 is listed in table  1 for each chemical composition .",
    "evolutionary tracks were constructed including core overshoot for stars with masses in excess of @xmath2 .",
    "the young isochrones were then constructed using the evolutionary tracks with overshoot for @xmath26 @xmath25 @xmath2 , and evolutionary tracks with no overshoot for lower masses .",
    "note that the mass interval between our adjacent models in the grid of evolutionary tracks being 0.1 @xmath1 , the value of @xmath2 effectively used in the interpolation is between the listed value of @xmath2 and ( @xmath2 @xmath27 0.1 ) . for isochrones older than 3 gyr , we used stellar models with no overshoot regardless of mass .",
    "this procedure is satisfactory for stars with metallicities close to that of the sun .",
    "for example , for solar composition @xmath2 is near 1.2 @xmath1 , which means that the procedure seems acceptable when @xmath23 @xmath25 ( @xmath2 + 0.2 ) .",
    "subsequent interpolations of the @xmath0 isochrones in a variety of research applications revealed that this step function approach could create locally unphysical distortions of the isochrone and luminosity function .",
    "the assumptions made in the original @xmath0 isochrones can be invalid for chemical compositions very different from the solar abundance .",
    "in addition , setting the transition age at 3 gyr , which was selected on the basis of the available cluster cmd s , is unrealistic for high metallicity isochrones .",
    "the `` transition age '' @xmath28 ( i.e. the age at which convective cores begin to affect the turnoff morphology ) increases sharply with increasing metallicity . for z",
    "= 0.0001 , @xmath28 is 1.2 gyr , whereas for z = 0.04 , @xmath28 reaches 7 gyr .",
    "the improvement in our overshoot treatment is two folds .",
    "first , we take into account the metallicity dependence of @xmath2 . as a result ,",
    "the transition age @xmath28 defined in  5.1 is no longer fixed at 3  gyr but changes as a function of metallicity .",
    "second , we include the condition that the extent of core overshoot should decrease to zero as the convective core radius approaches zero .",
    "as noted above , this change is required for the most metal - rich mixtures , in which small convective cores may still be present near the turnoff for ages well above 3  gyr .",
    "the step function has now been replaced by a smoother function for the overshoot parameter in the evolutionary calculations . the precise dependence and the numerical procedure",
    "are chosen for compatibility with the rest of the @xmath0 evolutionary tracks , within the simple pressure scale height description of overshoot used in the models .",
    "a grid of evolutionary tracks has been constructed in the transition mass region , and a revised set of isochrones was then calculated which incorporates the improved evolutionary tracks .    for the purpose of this study ,",
    "we have adopted the following prescription for ramping between @xmath2 and ( @xmath2 @xmath29 0.2 ) : +   + @xmath18 = 0.0  for  @xmath26  @xmath30 @xmath2 + @xmath18 = 0.05  for  @xmath26 = @xmath2 + @xmath18 = 0.1  for  @xmath26 = @xmath2 + 0.1 + @xmath18 = 0.15  for  @xmath26 = @xmath2 + 0.2 + @xmath18 = 0.2  for  @xmath26  @xmath10 @xmath2 + 0.2 + the values of @xmath2 used in the evolutionary tracks are given in table  1 , as function of chemical composition",
    ". they were then combined with the existing evolutionary tracks calculated with @xmath18 = 0.2 for @xmath26  @xmath10 @xmath2 + 0.2 , and with @xmath18 = 0.0 for @xmath26  @xmath30 @xmath2 .",
    "new isochrones were constructed using the same isochrone generation codes as in papers i and ii only after minor alterations .",
    "the four panels of figure  1 compare the transition region for isochrones before and after applying the patch , for z = 0.0001 , 0.001 , 0.004 and 0.02 , respectively .",
    "a major usefulness of the overshoot - ramping is that it allows a much smoother age interpolation between isochrones when the population s turnoff mass is near @xmath2 , that is , near the transition age .",
    "figure  2 illustrates the improvement .",
    "the old and new overshoot treatments make little or no changes for ages larger than the transition age because such old isochrones are constructed solely based on the stellar models without a convective core . in the case of z",
    "= 0.001 , the transition age is roughly 1.92.0  gyr .",
    "as expected , little change has been made to the 4  gyr isochrone .",
    "the problems in the previous isochrones are however clearly visible in the interpolated isochrones for smaller ages .",
    "the two intermediate - age isochrones ( 1.8 and 2.5  gyr ) were produced using the interpolation routine provided in paper 1 .",
    "three features , marked as ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , summarize the problems with the paper 1 isochrones .",
    "feature ( a ) in dotted line shows a second dip below the major main - sequence dip .",
    "this is simply an artifact caused by the previous delta function treatment on the overshoot parameter .",
    "feature ( b ) clearly shows how the interpolation fails for the age near the transition age .",
    "lastly , feature ( c ) shows a failure in the temperature interpolation on the red giant branch .",
    "all these problems have now been solved by the introduction of the ramping treatment on the overshoot . in the rest of this paper",

    "the new isochrones show a good fit to the observed cmds .",
    "on the observational side , two space asteroseismology missions , wire ( buzasi 2000 ) and most ( matthews et al .",
    "2000 ) have begun to provide data on a few selected bright star targets .",
    "the analysis of these data holds great promise for testing the internal structure of these stars and the chemical composition profile in their interiors ( basu et al . 2004",
    "; guenther & brown 2004 ) . in particular , seismology is expected to reveal the presence and extent of convective cores and envelopes in stellar interiors ( audard et al .",
    "1995 ; chaboyer et al .",
    "1999b ) .    on the side of theoretical convection modeling",
    ", it is expected that future progress in core overshoot understanding will result from a combination of analytical and numerical hydrodynamical approaches . as an example",
    ", the implementation of the kuhfu   theory in the yrec stellar evolution code has already yielded a more physically realistic description of the overshoot process ( straka et al .",
    "because core overshoot reaches its full development in a narrow mass interval above @xmath2 , a fine mass grid of evolutionary tracks , i.e. with a mass increment as small as 0.001 @xmath35 , will be required for future isochrone construction in the transition region .",
    "already , extremely fine mass grids have been found to be necessary to fully exploit the information contained in high quality asteroseismic data ( guenther & brown 2004 ) . the confrontation of these models with seismic observations from the wire and most space missions will in the next few years provide the foundation for a physical theory of convective core overshoot on which to base the next generation of isochrones .",
    "we are indebted to ata sarajedini for kindly sending us cluster cmd data .",
    "this research has been supported in part by grants nag5 - 8406 and nag5 - 13299 from nasa to yale university ( pd ) and by pparc theoretical cosmology rolling grant ppa / g / o/2001/00016 ( sky ) .",
