    "in recent years observations have shown that at the heart of most , if not all , massive galaxies is a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "the observed tight correlations between the smbh and galaxy bulge masses ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or stellar velocity dispersion @xcite , imply that the evolution of the galaxy and the central black hole are fundamentally intertwined .",
    "@xcite suggested that these tight correlations arise naturally from the self - regulated growth of smbhs through accretion of material as active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , triggered by the merger of gas - rich galaxies .",
    "tidal torques produced by the merger channel large amounts of gas onto the central nucleus , fuelling a powerful starburst and rapid black hole growth , until feedback from radiatively efficient accretion is able to drive quasar winds and expel the remaining gas from the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    there have been significant advances of late in the theoretical framework for understanding galaxy evolution by incorporating agn feedback , in particular to reproduce the global properties of galaxies observed in the current large scale surveys such as the sdss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the enormous amounts of energy produced by agn have also been invoked as efficient mechanisms to quench star - formation in galaxies , either via extreme feedback from quasars @xcite , or via low - level , quasi - continuous feedback from radiatively inefficient accretion of hot gas from the x - ray emitting halos of massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "given the fundamental link between smbhs and bulge growth as well as the importance of agn feedback for the evolution of the host galaxy , a key unresolved issue in astrophysics is determining the source of gas that fuels the growth of smbhs and resultant nuclear activity , and what triggers the gas inflow . as well as",
    "the previously described merger paradigm , secular processes including bar - driven gas inflows @xcite , disk - instabilities , stochastic collisions with molecular clouds @xcite , and stellar winds from evolved stars @xcite have all been proposed as means to supply gas onto smbhs and trigger their activity .",
    "a primary complication for understanding the nature of agn and their impact on galaxy evolution is the observed zoo of agn populations and classes .",
    "these are variously identified via optical spectroscopy or characteristic emission at x - ray , radio or infrared wavelengths , and each one shows a diverse range of eddington ratios or host galaxy properties . in principle , x - ray emission provides the cleanest and most reliable approach to selecting agn and in particular identifying those galaxies undergoing significant black hole growth .",
    "the hard x - ray emission is directly associated with accretion close in to the black hole ( 10100 gravitational radii ) .",
    "it is produced in the hot corona that surrounds the black hole by the inverse compton scattering of ultraviolet photons emitted by the accretion disk . except for strongly absorbed agn ( n@xmath17@xmath18 ) which are rare at low - redshifts @xcite",
    ", x - ray selection is nearly independent of obscuration .",
    "in contrast the selection of agn at uv / optical wavelengths is strongly affected by absorption and orientation effects , as well as being prone to contamination by stellar light . moreover , while x - ray and infrared - selected agn typically have eddington ratios of @xmath19110% @xcite , associating them with rapid black hole growth , radio - loud agn and low - luminosity optically - selected agn ( liners ) are characterized by much lower eddington ratios ( @xmath20 )",
    ".    the environments , galaxy hosts and clustering of the diverse classes of agn can provide important clues to understanding both the accretion processes powering the agn ( e.g. whether it is fuelled by the accretion of hot or cold gas ) , and its subsequent impact on the galaxy host in terms of building up its bulge or quenching its star - formation .",
    "this has motivated numerous authors who have examined the agn populations in massive galaxy clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) where , for the virialized galaxy population at least , only hot gas is available for accretion onto the smbhs .",
    "the distribution of agn in galaxy clusters provides a fundamental test for those accretion processes which require a ready supply of cold gas in the host galaxy , such as secular bar / disk - instabilities @xcite or the merger of two gas - rich galaxies .",
    "given the much lower fraction of galaxies with substantial reservoirs of hi gas found in cluster cores compared to the field ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , nuclear activity among the virialized cluster population should also be reduced .",
    "however , the molecular gas contents of late - type cluster galaxies appear normal @xcite , while @xcite and @xcite show that at least some cluster s0s are able to retain their molecular gas and dust contents through several gyr while virialized within the cluster . as disk - instabilities",
    "are described by the toomre criterion , it may be sufficient to simply _ reduce _ the gas surface density of cluster galaxies to prevent secular triggering of agn , by making the remaining gas stable against collapse . in the case of the merger paradigm",
    ", nuclear activity should be even more strongly suppressed within rich clusters . here",
    "the encounter velocities of galaxies are much greater than their internal velocity dispersions , preventing their coalescence , in spite of the high galaxy densities @xcite .",
    "gas - rich mergers should instead be most frequent in galaxy groups @xcite and the cluster outskirts , where many galaxies ( including gas - rich ones ) , under the influence of the cluster s tidal field , are part of a convergent flow resulting in enhanced interactions between neighbors @xcite . since these galaxies are falling into the cluster for the first time , they have yet to have their gas contents be affected by their passage through the dense intra - cluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "galaxy harassment due to frequent high - speed fly - by interactions has also been proposed as a means of triggering nuclear activity , by driving dynamical instabilities that efficiently channel gas onto the smbhs @xcite , although again this requires the host galaxy to contain a gas reservoir .",
    "the trends predicted by associating x - ray agn to gas - rich galaxies could be diluted however , or even reversed , by the tendency of x - ray agn ( above a given @xmath21 ) to be hosted by the most luminous galaxies @xcite , a population which is most centrally concentrated within clusters @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite show the x - ray agn fraction to increase by an order of magnitude from low - mass populations ( @xmath22 ) to the most massive galaxies ( @xmath23 ) in both cluster and field populations .",
    "these trends act as physical selection effect , as the most luminous galaxies are more likely bulge - dominated and hence have higher black hole masses .",
    "thus for the same accretion rate relative to the eddington limit , the higher mass galaxy , will likely have a higher x - ray luminosity , and be more likely detected above a fixed @xmath21 limit .",
    "if nuclear activity is not dependent on a cold gas supply , but is being instead fuelled by the accretion of hot gas from the halos of massive galaxies @xcite or recycled gas from evolved stars @xcite then we would expect nuclear activity to be most prevalent among the massive elliptical galaxies that dominate cluster cores . in this case",
    "the agn fraction should be higher in clusters than the field .",
    "the earliest works identified agn via their optical emission lines @xcite , finding them to be much rarer among cluster members than in field samples .",
    "more recent studies based on the sdss have obtained rather conflicting results , with some confirming the previous decline in the agn fraction with galaxy density @xcite , while others find no apparent trend with environment @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that while overall the fraction of galaxies which host a powerful optical agn ( with @xmath24[oiii@xmath25{>}10^{7}l_{\\odot}$ ] ) decreases towards the cores of clusters , when considering just star - forming galaxies , the agn fraction remains constant with cluster - centric radius .",
    "they suggest that the decline in the agn fraction is almost exclusively an effect of the increasing number of red sequence galaxies , a population which hosts very few strong agn .",
    "the launches of the _ chandra _ and _ xmm x - ray observatories _ have opened up an efficient way of identifying x - ray agn in and around massive clusters from the same images used to probe the fundamental properties of the clusters themselves ( e.g. masses , @xmath26 ) .",
    "statistical analyses of x - ray point sources in cluster fields have reported overdensities of x - ray sources with respect to non - cluster fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found an excess of @xmath27 x - ray point sources per cluster within 1mpc from a sample of 148 clusters at @xmath28 .",
    "they found the radial distribution of these excess sources consistent with a flat radial distribution within 1mpc , although they could also be consistent with being drawn from the general cluster galaxy population .",
    "@xcite found instead a central spike within 0.5mpc followed by a secondary broad peak at the virial radius for relaxed clusters , with flatter spatial distributions for disturbed systems .",
    "@xcite instead found that the overdensity of x - ray point sources in 16 clusters at @xmath29 to be a factor @xmath30 less than that of bright optical galaxies , and concluded that the triggering of luminous ( @xmath8ergs@xmath2 ) x - ray agn to be strongly suppressed in rich clusters .",
    "@xcite performed a redshift survey of x - ray point sources in 8 clusters at @xmath31 , identifying 30 x - ray agn with @xmath32ergs@xmath2 and @xmath33 .",
    "six of these clusters were x - ray luminous systems with @xmath34ergs@xmath2 , including abell 1689 .",
    "the other two were the pair of low - mass merging clusters abell 3125 and abell 3128 at @xmath35 .",
    "abell 3125 in fact does not have a diffuse icm , while the icm for abell 3128 is double peaked .",
    "the resulting x - ray agn fraction of @xmath36% among cluster galaxies brighter than @xmath37 , was much higher than previously expected and remarkably similar to those found in the field @xcite .",
    "this suggested little or no environmental dependence and that cluster galaxies could retain significant reservoirs of cold gas near their central smbhs .",
    "the x - ray agn fraction was highest ( @xmath38% ) in the two low - mass merging systems abell 3125/3128 .",
    "only a small fraction of these x - ray agn would have been classified as such from their optical spectra , and so the difference in the observed environmental trends seen in optically - selected qsos in which they avoid cluster cores ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , was put down to biases against detection of low - luminosity agn due to host galaxy dilution and obscuration . in the dynamical analysis of the same sample , both the stacked velocity and radial distributions of the x - ray agn",
    "were found to be entirely consistent with being drawn from the overall cluster galaxy population @xcite .",
    "the most luminous x - ray agn with @xmath8ergs@xmath2 were however found to be _ more _ centrally concentrated than inactive cluster galaxies .",
    "this study had little coverage of the cluster outskirts , with 90% of the x - ray agn within 0.5@xmath39 .",
    "however , @xcite using mosaics of _ chandra _ images covering the virialized regions of abell 85 and abell 754 ( two merging clusters at @xmath40 with @xmath41ergs@xmath2 ) , obtained similar trends , with again no differences in the spatial distributions ( both radially or in velocity ) of x - ray agn ( with @xmath32ergs@xmath2 ) and non - active cluster galaxies .",
    "@xcite instead found that the 11 x - ray agn within the supercluster a901/2 at @xmath42 lie predominately in intermediate density regions , avoiding the cluster cores , prefering instead the cluster outskirts or group - like environments containing more blue galaxies than on average .    from these analyses",
    "it remains unclear whether the x - ray agn observed in galaxy clusters should be considered to be virialized or an infalling population .",
    "given the small numbers of clusters studied in detail with extensive spectroscopy , it is unlikely that the previous three samples can be regarded as representative of the general massive cluster population .",
    "the samples of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite all appear overrepresented by merging systems .",
    "what is lacking is a statistical sample of spectroscopically - confirmed x - ray agn from a large , representative set of massive clusters at a specific epoch .",
    "the aim of this present work is to produce such a sample , taking advantage of the unique multi - wavelength dataset recently assembled within locuss ( local cluster substructure survey ) .",
    "locuss is a multi - wavelength survey of x - ray luminous galaxy clusters at @xmath43 drawn from the rosat all sky survey cluster catalogs @xcite .",

    "the science goals and design of this theme are described in detail by @xcite . in summary , we have obtained panoramic multi - wavelength data ( fuv  fir ) on a morphologically unbiased sample of 30 clusters whose x - ray luminosities span @xmath440.12.4kev@xmath45ergs@xmath2 . these data span fields of @xmath46 ",
    "i.e.  out to @xmath47.52 cluster virial radii @xcite .",
    "these 30 clusters were selected from the parent sample simply on the basis of being observable by subaru on the nights allocated to us @xcite , and should therefore not suffer any gross biases towards ( for example ) cool core cluster , merging clusters etc .",

    "we have combined these x - ray data with our extensive spectroscopy ( @xmath4800400 members per cluster ) from mmt / hectospec , to derive a highly complete census of the x - ray agn population within this statistical sample of local clusters .",
    "we have performed a dynamical analysis of these cluster x - ray agn in order to understand whether they are hosted primarily by galaxies still infalling into the cluster ( and which may have yet to encounter the dense icm ) or rather galaxies which were accreted at early epochs and are now virialized .",

    "the probability of detecting none is just 0.002 .",
    "this region of phase - space should be dominated by those galaxies accreted earliest into the clusters (  [ sec : dynamic ] ) .",
    "we do note a couple of biases which may contribute to this apparent void .",

    "this is consistent with the nuclear activity responsible for the x - ray and infrared emission being gradually shut down as the host galaxies are accreted into the cluster , losing their orbital kinetic energy as part of the long dynamical process of becoming virialized cluster members .",
    "we note however , that the typical duty cycle of agn of @xmath192yr is much lower than the @xmath19312@xmath194yr cluster crossing time - scales which are likely required for such velocity segregation to occur ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "instead we suggest that the velocity segregation reflects the slow decline in the gas contents of the host galaxies available for intermittently fuelling nuclear activity .",
    "we attempt to confirm this viewpoint by going back to the stacked caustic plot for galaxies orbiting the 30 most massive clusters in the millennium simulation discussed in   [ sec : dynamic ] . in figure  [ backsplash ]",
    "we replot the caustic diagram of figure  [ zspace ] , but now split the galaxies into specific sub - populations based on their orbital paths .    in the left - hand panel we show only those galaxies which are on their first infall into the cluster , that is they have negative radial velocities and are yet to reach pericenter for the first time .",
    "each point is color coded according to its physical ( 3d ) distance from the cluster center in units of @xmath49 .",
    "we see that these galaxies show a wide range of line - of - sight velocities , evenly distributed over the phase - space with a slight preference towards the caustics at @xmath195 , as shown previously by their flat - topped velocity dispersion in figure  [ velhist ] .",
    "this was found to be the sub - population with the distribution of galaxies in the caustic diagram which was the most qualitatively similar to that seen for the x - ray agn detected by _",
    "spitzer _ ( the magenta points in fig .  [ caustic ] ) .",
    "we note that although there is no concentration of galaxies towards low relative los velocities and radii ( as seen for the earliest accreted galaxies ) , they do not entirely avoid this region either ( as our observed x - ray agn apparently do ) .",
    "this could only be achieved by removing those galaxies within physical radii of @xmath196.5@xmath49 ( red , orange points ) and also those at @xmath197 ( blue points ) .",
    "however this would also impact the required presence of galaxies at @xmath198 and low projected cluster - centric radii ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "we believe that many of the x - ray agn are near pericenter as required to achieve their high los velocities .",
    "the galaxies with the highest los velocities along the caustics at @xmath195 are found to be infalling galaxies at @xmath200.251.0@xmath49 ( orange , yellow points ) .",
    "such high los velocities are notably not seen for those infalling galaxies at large physical distances from the cluster ( @xmath197 ; blue points ) .",
    "these galaxies have detached from the hubble flow but havent fallen sufficiently far into the cluster gravitational potential well to attain the very high infall velocities required to be located along the caustics , resulting in them having relative line - of - sight velocities within @xmath190 .",
    "this could suggest that the nuclear activity is being triggered in these infra - red bright galaxies as they are accreted into the cluster for the first time , at @xmath8012@xmath49 from the cluster center , when the galaxies have reached close to their maximal velocities , or indeed at pericenter passage .",
    "this phase could be induced by galaxy harassment whereby infalling spiral galaxies undergo frequent high - speed fly - by encounters with other cluster members , or tidal shocks as they pass through the cluster core , driving instabilities that funnel gas into the central regions triggering nuclear activity @xcite .",
    "this would be consistent with our finding that all but one of the ir - bright x - ray agn are spirals or unresolved .",
    "unfortunately , as our _ chandra _ data do not extend into the infall regions beyond 11.5@xmath49 , we can not easily test whether there are extra x - ray agn among the infalling population just at these cluster - centric radii ( as opposed to further out in the infall regions ) .    in the right - hand panel",
    "we show the back - splash population of galaxies which have passed through the cluster core for the first time and are on their way back out of the cluster .",
    "that is they are between first pericenter and apocenter along their orbits and have positive radial velocities . in terms of cluster - centric radius",
    "this population peaks at @xmath201 , becoming steadily less frequent towards the lowest projected radii .",
    "this is due to them having their highest orbital velocities at pericenter , slowing down as they approach apocenter and hence spending more time near this point .",
    "although the spread of los velocities for the back - splash population is similar to that for the infalling galaxies , they are more concentrated towards low los velocities , as seen previously by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we believe this distribution more closely resembles that seen for our x - ray agn not detected with _ spitzer _",
    "( black points in fig .  [ caustic ] ) .",
    "this back - splash population is observed @xmath47gyr later after accretion into the cluster than the infalling population , as indicated by their predominately green symbols in the figure .",
    "this suggests that as the galaxy passes through the cluster core for the first time , the gas available for star formation and its associated infrared emission is removed via ram - pressure stripping , while the gas available for nuclear activity , being deeper in the galaxy potential is harder to sweep out , allowing nuclear activity to continue past pericenter passage .",
    "the different morphologies of the galaxies hosting the ir - bright ( mostly spirals ) and ir - dim ( mostly e / s0s ) x - ray agn suggests however that the primary factor in determining whether the host galaxy is ir - luminous is the global availability of gas and dust in the galaxy host itself , ir - dim x - ray agn being hosted in early - type galaxies which have sufficient gas in the nucleus to fuel the agn , but not enough on larger scales to feed obscured star formation .",
    "the results of our dynamical analysis of x - ray agn are in marked contrast to the comparable survey of @xcite who found that the spatial and kinematical distribution of their x - ray agn sample were fully consistent with being drawn from the inactive cluster population .",
    "given that their sample size is similar to ours , it is surprising that the results are so different and apparently inconsistent .",
    "the primary difference between the surveys is that their x - ray agn are systematically less luminous than ours .",
    "hence , in the scenario described above in which nuclear activity is slowly quenched when the host galaxy is accreted into the cluster , the low - luminosity x - ray agn that dominate the sample of @xcite may have witnessed the cluster environment for longer than those in our sample , and so are less kinematically distinct from the general cluster population .",
    "interestingly , @xcite find that the fraction of seyfert 2 objects among their all - sky hard x - ray agn sample is much higher within the largest concentrations of matter in the local universe , suggesting that the broad - line type i agn are being preferentially shut down in these dense environments , consistent broadly with our kinematic segregation of ir - bright / ir - dim x - ray agn .",
    "we note finally that despite our result that the x - ray agn are an infalling population ( or just after pericenter ) which is strongly _ suppressed _ by the cluster environment , they represent a @xmath8081@xmath170 overdensity in redshift space with respect to the general field , as revealed by the x - ray luminosity function of cluster agn (  [ section : lf ] ) .",
    "this is fully consistent with the statistical overdensities of x - ray agn previously observed toward clusters with respect to non - cluster fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this does not imply that they are somehow triggered by the cluster environment , but instead reflects the overall significant ( @xmath4702@xmath202 ) overdensities of galaxies in the _ infall regions _ of clusters , that have yet to encounter the icm .",
    "indeed the redshift space density of normal cluster galaxies in our sample is @xmath156 higher than of field galaxies , higher than the respective overdensity of cluster x - ray agn .",
    "it is still possible that there is an increased frequency of nuclear activity among these infalling galaxies , due to encounters between galaxies in the connecting filamentary web , or pre - processing within infalling groups , although our lack of _ chandra _ coverage of these infall regions prevents us from measuring this .",
    "nuclear activity may also be triggered by their interaction with the cluster itself , either as they pass through virial shocks , via compression of gas onto the nucleus in the early stages of ram - pressure stripping , or tidal shocks as they pass through cluster pericenter .",
    "a complementary approach to constraining the typical environment of agn , and gain insights into the physical conditions of the accretion onto smbhs , is to measure the spatial clustering of x - ray agn to estimate the average dm halo mass harboring the agn and the relative frequency of being hosted by central or satellite galaxies .",
    "numerous clustering analyses have revealed a consistent view that x - ray agn are hosted in dm halos of masses @xmath203 , typical of poor groups , at all redshifts up to @xmath204 @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that they are predominately located at the centers of dm halos of mass @xmath205 , and tend to avoid satellite galaxies in comparable or more massive halos , fixing the limit to the fraction of agn in satellite galaxies to be @xmath2062% ( 90% confidence limit ) .",
    "similarly , @xcite find the clustering of x - ray agn to be consistent with that of typical galaxies on scales of 110mpc , but significantly anti - biased on small scales ( 0.31mpc ) , which they explain as due to their preferential location within central galaxies .",
    "@xcite also find that on 450kpc scales the most luminous x - ray agn ( @xmath207ergs@xmath2 ) are found in underdense environments in comparison to normal galaxies of the same stellar mass .    in direct contrast , @xcite found x - ray agn to be _ more _ clustered than galaxies at all scales , with no evidence for anti - bias on small scales .",
    "while they also obtained a typical host dm halo mass of @xmath208 , the stellar masses of their host galaxies were lower than expected for the typical central galaxy of such a halo , suggesting that they are associated to satellite galaxies .",
    "@xcite found excess clustering on small scales between x - ray agn and luminous red galaxies , consistent with a significant fraction of x - ray agn being hosted in satellite galaxies .",
    "@xcite also indicate that the agn fraction in groups and clusters declines with halo mass .",
    "@xcite also find that the x - ray agn fraction ( @xmath32ergs@xmath2 ) declines by a factor two from groups ( @xmath209 ) to clusters ( @xmath210 ) from their study of 16 systems at @xmath211 .",
    "this trend remained when considering only early - type galaxies , and so was independent of any differences in the morphological mix between groups and clusters .",
    "@xcite also observed a decline in agn fraction from groups to clusters ( including at fixed morphology ) for optically - selected agn .",
    "the observed dynamics of the x - ray agn in our cluster sample are consistent with their being entirely drawn from an infalling population , with essentially no component coming from virialized satellite galaxies within the cluster halo .",
    "these results are consistent with the clustering analyses of @xcite and @xcite , associating the x - ray agn with central galaxies . their reported anti - bias on small scales then reflects our observed suppression of nuclear activity among the virialized cluster galaxy population .",
    "it is instead hard to reconcile our results with the findings of @xcite and @xcite that x - ray agn being even more clustered on small scales than the already strongly clustered luminous red galaxies , as in this case they should be preferentially located in the cluster cores rather than avoiding them as we find .      studying the physical properties of the galaxies which host agn",
    "provide complementary clues as to their accretion processes .",
    "the stellar masses , bulge masses or stellar velocity dispersions can be used to estimate the mass of the central smbh via the known tight correlations , from which the eddington ratio can be derived . in the absence of direct measures of the hi or molecular gas contents , galaxy colors can be used as a proxy for star - formation history , and hence the availability of gas .",
    "finally , galaxy morphologies provide constraints on the stage of any ongoing merging event ( plus mass ratio ) or the presence of bars or disks required for the related secular processes .",
    "these probes are however more prone to systematics , as the agn can easily outshine the hosts , affecting not only their luminosities but also colors .",
    "@xcite found that while radio agn are hosted mainly by massive , red sequence galaxies , the x - ray and infrared - selected agn are instead both found in @xmath212 galaxies , with the x - ray population being preferentially `` green valley '' objects , while ir agn are slightly bluer .",
    "@xcite also found that x - ray agn are much more likely to be located within the blue cloud or green valley than the red sequence .",
    "@xcite suggest that the color distribution for x - ray agn hasnt evolved between @xmath213 and the present day . the optical colors and luminosities of our cluster x - ray agn",
    "are fully consistent with these field samples , being hosted typically by @xmath212 galaxies located both within the red sequence and the blue cloud ( fig .",
    "[ cmdiagram ] ) .",
    "we find marginally more x - ray agn along the cluster red sequence ( @xmath214% ) than @xcite ( @xmath215% ) , which could reflect a cluster - specific difference in the host properties , such as reduced levels of star formation , but more likely reflects our use of @xmath216 color rather than @xmath217 to define the red sequence , and the systematically lower x - ray luminosities in our sample .",
    "the ir - dim x - ray agn lie on or close to the cluster red sequence in fig .",
    "[ cmdiagram ] , suggesting little impact from the nuclear activity on galaxy color .",
    "we find the 24@xmath59m - detected x - ray agn to lie mostly within the blue cloud , consistent with @xcite , and suggesting star - formation concurrent with nuclear activity .    from our spectroscopic analysis of the cluster x - ray agn , we found that 38% show broad - line h@xmath130 emission of type i seyferts / qsos , 41% show narrow - line h@xmath130 emission which may be due to either nuclear activity of star formation , while 21% appear passive , lacking any clear emission lines .",
    "these fractions are strongly inconsistent with those obtained by @xcite from their spectroscopic survey of x - ray agn in clusters .",
    "they found that only 4 out of 40 x - ray agn showed clear optical signatures of nuclear activity in the form of significant oii , oiii or broad h@xmath130 emission .",
    "the remaining @xmath218% show only modest star formation or appear to be passively evolving galaxies .",
    "the primary difference between the two samples is that the x - ray agn from martini et al .",
    "are systematically @xmath219 less luminous than ours , having a mean value of @xmath220 as opposed to our mean value of @xmath221 .",
    "we would thus expect the levels of optical emission to be correspondingly lower from the unified agn model .",
    "@xcite find that low - luminosity x - ray agn are more likely to be absorbed ( @xmath222@xmath18 ) , which may further contribute to the lack of optical emission among the x - ray agn sample of @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath22315% of x - ray agn in the hst - cosmos field ( with @xmath224ergs@xmath2 ; @xmath225.31.0 ) showed any signs of distortions indicative of recent mergers , and indeed found no statistical difference in the distortion fractions between x - ray agn and inactive galaxies , indicating that major mergers are not the most relevant mechanism for the triggering of x - ray agn at @xmath226 .",
    "instead they found that over 55% of the x - ray agn are hosted by disk galaxies , and suggest that the bulk of black hole accretion occurs through internal secular fuelling processes and minor mergers .",
    "similarly , @xcite found while radio - loud agn are mostly hosted by early - type galaxies , x - ray agn are mostly either disk - dominated ( 3146% ) or unresolved point sources ( 3161% ) with few ( 921% ) hosted by bulge - dominated systems . in the local universe",
    ", @xcite found that x - ray agn are @xmath8051@xmath227 more likely to be hosted in spirals ( @xmath1940% ) or mergers ( @xmath1920% ) than inactive ( non - agn ) galaxies of the same stellar masses .",
    "@xcite did show however that _ some _ of the nuclear activity is triggered by interactions , showing that the agn fraction increases by up to @xmath219 for galaxies in close pairs with projected separations @xmath228kpc , and that this enhancement in nuclear activity is greatest for equal - mass galaxy pairings .",
    "the morphological composition of our cluster x - ray agn are broadly consistent with these previous studies , with 24/48 ( 50% ) being early - types ( e / s0s ) , 8 undisturbed spirals ( 17% ) , 9 disturbed spirals / mergers ( 19% ) and 7 unresolved objects ( 14% ) , which are either low - luminosity galaxies or qsos .",
    "we find a marginally higher fraction hosted by early - types , which could reflect the general increased prevalence of early - types among cluster galaxies , but could also be an overestimate due to our inability to robustly distinguish e / s0s and early - type spirals from the subaru imaging .",
    "the frequent hosting of x - ray agn ( at least for @xmath226 ) in otherwise undisturbed massive spirals appears inconsistent with the classical association between black hole accretion and bulge growth , and indeed the merger paradigm . as such we may have expected x - ray agn to be preferentially hosted by early - type galaxies which have the most massive black holes , and",
    "hence must have had the most nuclear activity in the past .",
    "@xcite have developed a scenario for the fuelling of agn in non - interacting spirals / s0s in which the accretion of cold gas onto supermassive black holes occurs via stochastic collisions with molecular clouds ( or the inflow of these clouds via disk / bar instabilities ) . in these systems ,",
    "the only requirement is the availability of cold gas within the disk , producing intermittent bursts of accretion at high eddington ratios ( @xmath80110% ) and duty cycles of @xmath47% .",
    "the resultant feedback from the agn is expected to have negligible impact on the host galaxy s disk and interstellar medium .",
    "the hosting of low - redshift x - ray agn within massive spirals can thus be simply understood as the requirement of an available supply of cold gas .",
    "while elliptical galaxies host the most massive supermassive black holes , their frequent lack of cold gas means that there is no fuel for future gas accretion or black hole growth , and hence they are less likely to be x - ray luminous .",
    "@xcite showed that early - type galaxies with strong nuclear activity ( based on their oiii emission ) almost always have blue uv  optical colors and blue outer regions indicative of a reservoir of cold gas in the disk capable of feeding the agn and star formation in the outer disk .",
    "the key finding from our study of the distribution and host properties of 48 x - ray agn identified from _",
    "chandra _ imaging of 26 massive clusters at @xmath0 is that they are clearly dynamically identified with an infalling population .",
    "this is manifest by their preferential location along the cluster caustics , complete avoidance of the caustic phase space with low relative velocities and cluster - centric radii , and their high velocity dispersion and non - gaussian velocity distribution .",
    "the optically - selected type i seyferts / qsos in our cluster sample show the same kinematical signatures .",
    "these provide the strongest observational constraints to date that the x - ray agn and optically - selected type i seyferts / qsos found in massive clusters are not a virialized population , and few if any can have resided within the dense icm for a significant length of time .",
    "the cluster environment must very effectively suppress radiatively - efficient nuclear activity in its member galaxies .",
    "the dynamical properties of our x - ray agn are very similar to those previously seen for late - type spiral galaxies in clusters , and a significant fraction ( @xmath229% ) of the galaxies hosting the agn are morphologically identified as spirals .",
    "this suggests that they are mostly triggered by secular processes such as bar / disk instabilities rather than mergers , although we do also find a number of x - ray agn associated with ongoing mergers .",
    "these results , in conjunction with the previous clustering analyses of @xcite and @xcite , all indicate that two key requirements for radiatively - efficient nuclear activity to occur in galaxies is that they are the central galaxy within their dark matter halo , and have a ready supply of cold gas .",
    "this latter requirement is supported by the high fraction of x - ray agn hosted by optically blue galaxies , both in clusters ( @xmath230% ) and the general field at @xmath226 .",

    "<S> we identify 48 x - ray agn among the cluster members , with luminosities @xmath4ergs@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> based on these identifications , we estimate that @xmath5% of cluster galaxies brighter than @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) host an x - ray agn with @xmath8ergs@xmath2 . in the stacked caustic diagram that shows @xmath9 versus @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> , the x - ray agn appear to preferentially lie along the caustics , suggestive of an infalling population . </S>",
    "<S> they also appear to avoid the region with lowest cluster - centric radii and relative velocities ( @xmath11 ; ) , which is dominated by the virialized population of galaxies accreted earliest into the clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the line - of - sight velocity histogram of the x - ray agn shows a relatively flat distribution , and is inconsistent with the gaussian distribution expected for a virialized population at 98.9% confidence </S>",
    "<S> . moreover the velocity dispersion of the 48 x - ray agn is @xmath12 that of the overall cluster population , which is consistent with the @xmath13 ratio expected by simple energetic arguments when comparing infalling versus virialized populations . </S>",
    "<S> this kinematic segregation is significant at the 4.66-@xmath14 level . when splitting the x - ray agn sample into two according to x - ray or infrared ( ir ) luminosity , both x - ray bright ( @xmath8 ) and ir - bright ( @xmath15 ) sub - samples show higher velocity dispersions than their x - ray dim and ir - dim counterparts at @xmath16 significance . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the nuclear activity responsible for the x - ray and ir emission being slowly shut down as the host galaxies are accreted into the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> overall our results provide the strongest observational evidence to date that x - ray agn found in massive clusters are an infalling population , and that the cluster environment very effectively suppresses radiatively - efficient nuclear activity in its member galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these results are consistent with the view that for galaxies to host an x - ray agn they should be the central galaxy within their dark matter halo and have a ready supply of cold gas . </S>"
