    "different problems in probability and statistics naturally lead to different choices of probability metric .",
    "one such choice is the mallows distance , also known as the wasserstein or kantorovich distance .",
    "this metric has found extensive applications to a wide variety of fields ; see @xcite for a review .",
    "[ def : mallows ] for @xmath0 , let @xmath1 denote the set of distribution functions @xmath2 satisfying @xmath3 . for @xmath4 ,",

    "we also write @xmath11 for @xmath5 , where this will cause no confusion .",
    "the empirical process is a fundamental quantity of interest .",
    "though often not explicitly recognised as such , the mallows distance between the empirical distribution and the underlying population has arisen in the work of several authors , including @xcite and @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath12 are independent random variables , each having distribution function @xmath2 with mean @xmath13 and finite variance @xmath14 , and let @xmath15 denote the empirical distribution function of the sample , given by @xmath16    the main contributions of this paper are threefold :    1 .",
    "in theorem  [ thm : limdisc ] , we show that in the case of a discrete underlying population of finite support , @xmath17 converges to an explicit nondegenerate limiting distribution .",
    "we contrast this with the @xmath18 normalisation required by the previously cited authors in the absolutely continuous case .",
    "2 .   in section  [ section : tail ] , we study the tail conditions required by @xcite and @xcite for the convergence of @xmath19 in the absolutely continuous case . in particular , by considering the hazard function ,",
    "we show that one of the conditions of @xcite is redundant , and the statement of theorem  2.1 of @xcite may be simplified .",
    "3 .   section  [ section : boot ] is devoted to an application of these results .",
    "we recall the calculation of @xcite , showing that @xmath20 provides an upper bound on the mallows distance between the bootstrap distribution of the sample mean and its true sampling distribution .",
    "we give a straightforward lower bound on this latter quantity , yielding conditions under which the upper and lower bounds are of the same order .",
    "first , recall the following two lemmas about @xmath22 , which are proved in @xcite and @xcite respectively .    for @xmath4 , the infimum in definition  [ def : mallows ]",
    "is attained by the following construction : let @xmath23 , and set @xmath24 , @xmath25 , where , for example , @xmath26 . thus @xmath27    [ lem : equivmetr ] if @xmath28 and @xmath29 , then @xmath30 as @xmath31 if and only if , for every bounded , continuous function @xmath32 , we have both    1 .",
    "@xmath33 2 .",
    "@xmath34    thus , convergence in the mallows metric @xmath22 is equivalent to convergence in distribution together with convergence of the @xmath35th absolute moments .",
    "it follows immediately by lemma [ lem : equivmetr ] and the strong law of large numbers that @xmath36 almost surely as @xmath37 .",
    "it is important to remark that although we can calculate a rate of convergence of the two parts above ( that is , convergence in distribution and of the @xmath35th absolute moment ) , this will not help us find a rate of convergence of @xmath38 , and we must use other techniques .",
    "when @xmath2 has a density @xmath39 , @xcite and @xcite give conditions under which @xmath19 converges to a nondegenerate limiting distribution .",
    "a simple version of such results is given in theorem  [ thm : rate ] below .",
    "however , these results do not cover the case of a discrete underlying population , which is studied later , in theorem  [ thm : limdisc ] .    in order to prove theorem  [ thm : rate ] , we need to introduce some notation .",
    "let @xmath40 $ ] denote the space of left - continuous , real - valued functions on @xmath41 $ ] possessing right limits at each point .",

    "this creates measurability problems , as explained in @xcite , which lead us to work with the space @xmath48 .",
    "a consequence of using the ball @xmath45-algebra is that we must make a slight modification to the notion of weak convergence , in line with @xcite , p.  67 :    if @xmath49 is a sequence of random elements of @xmath48 , we write @xmath50 as @xmath37 if @xmath51 as @xmath37 , for all bounded , continuous functions @xmath52 which are @xmath46-measurable .    throughout , @xmath53 denotes a brownian bridge ; that is , a zero mean gaussian process with @xmath54 for @xmath55 . for @xmath56 , let @xmath57 .",

    "we conclude that @xmath73 as @xmath37 .",
    "the result follows on noting that any bounded , continuous function from @xmath62 to @xmath62 is ( borel ) measurable .",
    "theorem  [ thm : rate ] is not the strongest possible ; in particular , it is not necessary for the underlying density to have bounded support . @xcite and",
    "@xcite obtain the same conclusion with conditions which amount to control of the behaviour of the tails of @xmath2 .",
    "for example , equations ( 3.16 ) and ( 3.14 ) of @xcite consist of the following two conditions :    as @xmath74 , [ cond:3.16 ] @xmath75    [ cond:3.14 ] @xmath76    a version of theorem  2.1 of @xcite gives the following :    [ thm : csorgo ] suppose that @xmath2 has a density @xmath39 such that @xmath58 is positive and continuous for @xmath56 , and monotone for @xmath77 sufficiently close to zero and one .",
    "if conditions [ cond:3.16 ] and [ cond:3.14 ] hold , then @xmath63 as @xmath37 .    proposition  1 of @xcite verifies condition  [ cond:3.16 ] when @xmath2 is the normal distribution .",
    "we generalise this proposition in section  [ section : tail ] , by showing that condition  [ cond:3.16 ] holds when the hazard function diverges in the tails . in particular",
    "then , condition  [ cond:3.16 ] will be seen to be a consequence of condition  [ cond:3.14 ] .",
    "now , we turn to the case of discrete random variables . note that in theorem  [ thm : limdisc ] below",
    ", we can understand the limiting distribution as the integral between 0 and 1 of a sum of delta functions at the points where @xmath78 jumps .",

    "the bootstrap was introduced into statistics in the landmark paper of @xcite , and gives a very general technique for approximating the distributions of roots ( i.e. functions of the sample and parameters of the underlying population ) of interest . the key idea for its use in practice",
    "is that of resampling ; given a sample @xmath192 , we draw a further sample @xmath193 uniformly at random with replacement from the original sample , and perform our calculations based on this resample .",
    "the opportunity to repeat this resampling procedure enables the practitioner to mimic drawing additional samples from the original population .    historically , one of the great early triumphs in the analysis the bootstrap was the paper of @xcite .",
    "one of his main results was to show that the bootstrap distribution of a normalised sample mean converges to its true sampling distribution at rate @xmath194 , provided the underlying population is non - lattice , and sufficiently many moments exist .",

    "singh s theorem was stated in terms of the supremum distance between the respective distribution functions .",
    "the mallows metric was first considered in the context of the bootstrap by @xcite .",
    "recall that @xmath192 are independent random variables , each with distribution function @xmath2 with mean @xmath13 and finite variance @xmath14 , that @xmath15 is the empirical distribution function of the sample and that @xmath196 is the sample mean . a standard procedure for constructing confidence intervals for @xmath13 is to invert a probability statement concerning a root such as @xmath197 , whose sampling distribution under @xmath2 we denote by @xmath198 .",
    "conditional on @xmath192 , let @xmath193 be a resample ; that is , an independent and identically distributed sample drawn from @xmath15 .    the nonparametric bootstrap estimates the sampling distribution of @xmath197 by that of @xmath199 , where @xmath200 . in other words ,",
    "conditional on @xmath192 , we approximate @xmath198 by @xmath201 .",

    "the calculation below follows @xcite , and uses results proved in @xcite .",
    "@xmath203 thus , in particular , the distance between the distribution of the root of interest , @xmath198 , and its bootstrap approximation , @xmath201 , is stochastically dominated by the distance between the true and empirical distributions . the first inequality and the conditions under which we obtain equality",
    "are studied in @xcite .",
    "having studied the upper bound @xmath204 in previous sections , our final result gives a lower bound on the rate of convergence of @xmath205 .",
    "observe in particular that if the hypotheses of theorem  [ thm : rate ] and proposition  [ prop : delta ] are both satisfied , then the rates of convergence of the two bounds are identical .      1 .   if @xmath206 , then @xmath207 is bounded away from zero in probability ; in fact , for every @xmath208 , @xmath209 as @xmath37 .",
