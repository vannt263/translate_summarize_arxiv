    "a distinct subset of moderate age supernova remnants ( snrs ) are characterized by an x - ray morphology which is centrally brightened , in contrast to a more limb - brightened radio profile . in some cases ( e.g. cta  1 [ slane et  al . 1997 ] , msh 116_2 _ [ harrus , hughes , & slane 1998 ] ,",
    "g39.2 - 0.1 [ harrus & slane 1999 ] ) recent observations have shown that the central emission is nonthermal in nature , presumably associated with a pulsar - driven synchrotron nebula . for others , however , the central emission is decidedly thermal ( e.g. w44 [ jones , smith & angellini 1993 ] ; 3c391 [ rho & petre 1996 , chen & slane 2001 ] ; g272.23.2 [ harrus et  al .",
    "a recent list of the members of this `` mixed morphology '' class of snrs has been compiled by rho & petre ( 1998 ) .",
    "the evolutionary characteristics which have led to such an observed profile are not well understood .",
    "one possible scenario is that the shells in these remnants have recently become radiative , thus leaving only the hot interior to persist in x - rays ( smith et  al .",
    "1985 , harrus et  al . 1997 ) , a picture that is enhanced by the effects of thermal conduction on the temperature and density distribution in the snr ( cox et  al . 1999 ) .",
    "another suggestion is that the central emission measure has been enhanced by the presence of cool clouds left relatively intact after the passage of the blast wave to slowly evaporate in the hot snr interior ( cowie & mckee 1977 , mckee & ostriker 1977 , white & long 1991 ) .",
    "early x - ray observations with the _ einstein _ observatory ( seward 1990 ) established the center - filled nature of the x - ray emission from g290.10.8 .",
    "however , the spectral characteristics of the remnant are poorly constrained by these data , leaving open the question of whether the centrally enhanced x - ray emission is thermal or nonthermal in nature .",
    "the remnant was not observed with the rosat pspc .",
    "optical observations of the remnant show patchy emission with an enhanced [ s ii]/h@xmath1 ratio typical of snrs ( kirshner & winkler 1979 , elliott & malin 1979 ) . in the radio band ( figure 1 ) g290.10.8  is classified as a shell - type snr ( green 1998 ) although the morphology is actually somewhat `` plateau - like '' with the exception of a partial shell along the western limb along with other patchy structures interior to the snr boundary ( whiteoak & green 1996 ) . the remnant is @xmath2 in size , distinctly elongated in the southeast - northwest direction .",
    "this is roughly aligned with the galactic plane , much like other `` bilateral '' snrs whose morphologies may be the result of magnetic field structures near the plane ( gaensler 1998 ) .",
    "a young pulsar ( j1105 - 6107 ) has been discovered nearby the snr ( kaspi et  al . 1997 ) .",
    "its location is well outside the remnant , along the axis of elongation ( and outside the field of view in figure 1 ) .",
    "the spin - down age of the pulsar is @xmath3  kyr , considerably larger than the expected age for a remnant which is still x - ray luminous .",
    "moreover , as pointed out by kaspi et  al . ( 1997 ) , the age is even larger for a braking index @xmath4 , which may be more typical of pulsars .",
    "these standard calculations assume that the current spin period @xmath5 is much longer than the initial period @xmath6 ( i.e. that the pulsar has spun down considerably since birth ) .",
    "relaxing this constraint can lead to an inferred pulsar age that is consistent with that of the remnant .",
    "we discuss constraints on the association of j1105 - 6107 with g290.10.8  in section 4 below .",

    "however , studies of the /h@xmath1  ratio for snrs in m33 ( smith et al .",

    "we report on x - ray observations of g290.10.8  with the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca ) in which we establish the thermal nature of the central x - ray emission and address the observed spectral and spatial characteristics . in section 2",
    "we discuss the observations and the results of the spectral analysis .",
    "we then investigate two scenarios to explain the x - ray characteristics : a cloudy ism interpretation , using the similarity solution derived by white and long ( 1991 ) ; and an snr with thermal conduction interpretation , using a shock code to follow the evolution of model remnants until properties representative of those observed are achieved .",
    "finally , we present a discussion of these results .",
    "g290.10.8  was observed with the asca observatory for 40 ks on march 1 , 1994 . due to observation at small earth angle , however , standard screening resulted in the rejection of a large fraction of the sis data .",
    "a repeat observation was performed on january 16 , 1995 .",
    "the resulting sis data were of somewhat reduced quality from that originally expected because of the degradation of the sis detectors in 4-ccd mode .",
    "the gis image ( @xmath15  kev ) of g290.10.8 with radio contours from the most image ( whiteoak & green 1996 ) , is shown in figure 2 . here",
    "the x - ray data have been smoothed with a 30 arcsec gaussian followed by a background subtraction and vignetting correction .",
    "the boundary of the x - ray emission is strikingly similar to the radio boundary , but the morphology is centrally bright in x - rays while the radio emission shows no evidence of any enhancement associated with the bright x - ray center .",
    "the position of the peak x - ray emission is at roughly ra@xmath16 : 11@xmath1703@xmath18 , dec@xmath16 : @xmath1954@xmath20 .",
    "x - ray images of composite snrs ( i.e. those containing a central pulsar - driven synchrotron nebula ) show distinct morphological differences above and below @xmath21  kev , with the high energy tail of the power law spectrum from the centrally located synchrotron nebula dominating above 1.5  kev , where the thermal emission from the shell has fallen off ( see harrus , hughes , & slane 1997 , harrus & slane 1998 ) .",
    "we find no such energy dependence for the x - ray morphology of g290.10.8 ; the spectral characteristics appear relatively uniform over the remnant .    to determine the spectral properties , we have carried out joint spectral fits using the asca gis and sis data .",
    "for the gis data we have used the outer regions of the detectors for extraction of background spectra .",
    "use of blank - sky data for background , which were obtained at a high galactic latitude ( and thus do not include any contribution from the galactic ridge emission in the direction of g290.10.8 ) yields similar results for the spectral analysis .",
    "background for the sis was taken from blank - sky fields .",
    "all gis2 and gis3 data were merged to produce a single spectrum . in the earlier observation ,",
    "the gis3 data were taken with 128 bin spectral resolution in order to provide increased timing resolution .",
    "all gis data were thus rebinned to this resolution before forming the joint spectrum ; no loss of intrinsic instrument resolution is introduced in this process .",
    "a total of @xmath22 gis events were obtained with a total effective integration time of 139 ks .",
    "the sis data were also merged to form a joint spectrum yielding a total of @xmath23 events with an effective exposure of 52 ks .",
    "the spectra ( figure 3 ) are roughly described by a thermal plasma in ionization equilibrium ( raymond & smith 1977 ) with the addition of a weak power law component ; the observed temperature is @xmath24 kev with an absorption in excess of @xmath25 , and the fit yields a reduced @xmath26 of 1.42 . a gain adjustment of @xmath27",
    "is required for the gis data , a value which is within the uncertainties of the instrument calibration .",
    "the spectral fit is significantly improved with increased abundances for mg , si , and s , yielding a final reduced @xmath26 of 1.02 for the spectral values shown in table 1 . the small hard component ( @xmath27 of the unabsorbed flux )",
    "may be an artifact of residual galactic ridge emission , though we note that there is no evidence of iron - line features which typically characterize such emission ( yamauchi & koyama 1993 ) .",
    "alternatively , this component could be associated with synchrotron emission from electrons accelerated by the snr shock .",

    ", the spectrum clearly establishes that the bright central x - ray emission is thermal in nature .",

    "1994 ) although this may also act to reduce the evaporation process because thermal conduction is heavily suppressed across magnetic field lines .      in the later phases of snr evolution , the shock front slows and becomes radiative , as the shocked material cools immediately after being heated .",

    "the evaporation timescale for the clouds is @xmath95 times the age of the snr , which may be problematic given that cloud - crushing timescales are typically much shorter than this .",
    "the observed brightness profile is more centrally peaked than the model predicts , which may indicate a need to consider a density profile modified by a precursor wind .",
    "a hydrodynamic model which follows the remnant evolution toward the radiative phase , and incorporates the effects of thermal conduction , is also capable of increasing the central x - ray brightness and producing a somewhat flattened temperature distribution , but the brightness and temperature profiles differ considerably from those observed .",
    "it would appear that this model requires modifications to the ambient medium , and perhaps the ejecta component , in order to more closely reproduce the observed properties .",
    "the density required to reproduce the size and flux is @xmath96 , and the distance range associated with the explosion energy range used above is also @xmath91  kpc .    with either of the above interpretations ,",
    "the angular separation between g290.10.8  and psr  j1105 - 610  relative to the remnant radius implies a pulsar velocity much larger than that typical of even high velocity pulsars .",
    "this would suggest that psr  j1105 - 610  is not likely to be associated with the snr if either of these interpretations for the evolution are correct .",

    "<S> g290.10.8 ( msh  116_1_a ) is a supernova remnant ( snr ) whose x - ray morphology is centrally bright . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike the class of x - ray composite snrs whose centers are dominated by nonthermal emission , presumably driven by a central pulsar , we show that the x - ray emission from g290.10.8  is thermal in nature , placing the remnant in an emerging class which includes such remnants as w44 , w28 , 3c391 , and others . the evolutionary sequence which leads to such x - ray properties is not well understood . here </S>",
    "<S> we investigate two scenarios for such emission : evolution in a cloudy interstellar medium , and early - stage evolution of a remnant into the radiative phase , including the effects of thermal conduction . </S>",
    "<S> we construct models for these scenarios in an attempt to reproduce the observed center - filled x - ray properties of g290.10.8 , and we derive the associated age , energy , and ambient density conditions implied by the models . we find that for reasonable values of the explosion energy , the remnant age is of order @xmath0  yr . </S>",
    "<S> this places a fairly strong constraint on any association between g290.10.8  and psr  j1105 - 610 , which would require an anomalously large velocity for the pulsar .    </S>",
