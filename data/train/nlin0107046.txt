    "there has been much interest in the study of the collective dynamics of chaotic systems subjected to global interactions .",

    "the globally coupled map ( gcm ) lattice @xcite constitutes a prototype model for such global - coupling dynamics .",
    "it has recently been argued that gcm systems yield universal classes of collective phenomena @xcite .",
    "specifically , a gcm system can exhibit a variety of collective behaviors such as clustering ( i.e. , the formation of differentiated subsets of synchronized elements in the network ) @xcite ; non - statistical properties in the fluctuations of the mean field of the ensemble @xcite ; global quasiperiodic motion @xcite ; and different collective phases depending on the parameters of the system @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that a gcm system is closely related to a single map subjected to an external drive and that this analogy may be used to describe the emergence of clusters in gcm systems in geometrical terms @xcite .",
    "in particular , the phenomenon of clustering is relevant as it can provide a simple mechanism for segregation , ordering and onset of differentiation of elements in many physical and biological systems .",
    "in addition to gcm systems , dynamical clustering has also been found in a globally coupled rssler oscillators @xcite , neural networks @xcite , and coupled biochemical reactions @xcite .",
    "the interest in this phenomenon has recently grown , since dynamical clusters have been observed experimentally in an array of electrochemical oscillators interacting through a global coupling @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the process of cluster formation in general globally coupled map systems by focusing on the dynamics of their global coupling functions . in most studies on gcm systems , the mean field of the network has been used as the global coupling function . here , we study gcm systems subjected to different global coupling functions and show how they can be analyzed under a common framework .",
    "we investigate how the distribution of elements among a few clusters and their periodicities depend on the functional form of the global coupling .",

    "this property of the coupling function ensures that , at any time , each element of the globally coupled system is subjected to the same influence of the coupling term .",
    "some examples of coupling functions belonging to this class are @xmath13    the first two examples correspond to forward and backward mean field coupling , respectively , and they have been widely used in gcm studies .",
    "the third global coupling function is the usual dispersion or mean square deviation of @xmath5 variables , and it may describe systems whose elements do not interact when they are synchronized .",
    "this kind of global interaction might be relevant in some biological or social systems where the members of a community are driven by their deviations from the mean behavior .",
    "the last example is the geometric mean .",
    "this type of multiplicative coupling occurs , for instance , in a system of @xmath5 sequential amplifiers where the gain of element @xmath2 is a function of the magnitude of its state @xmath1 , and @xmath12 is proportional to the total gain of the system .",
    "many statistical functions of @xmath5 variables share the property of invariance under argument permutations and they could as well be taken as global coupling functions in gcm systems given by eq.([gcm ] ) .",
    "for some range of its parameters the gcm system in eq.([gcm ] ) reaches an asymptotic collective behavior characterized by the segregation of the elements into @xmath14 clusters , each exhibiting a period @xmath15 , where the @xmath16 cluster has a number @xmath17 of elements , with @xmath18 .",
    "the fraction @xmath19 of elements in the @xmath16 cluster is @xmath20 .",
    "the evolution of the @xmath21 cluster may be described by a variable @xmath22 which gives the common state of the @xmath17 elements belonging to this cluster at time @xmath4 . the periodic orbit adopted by the state @xmath22 of the @xmath16 cluster",

    "the specific partition @xmath24 into @xmath14 clusters and the specific values taken by the periodic orbit of each cluster depend on initial conditions and parameters of the system .",
    "when a gcm system falls into @xmath14 periodic clusters , the coupling function @xmath12 also shows a periodic motion . as an illustration of this behavior , fig .",
    "1(a ) shows a typical situation in which a gcm system , with global coupling function @xmath25 , displays two clusters , each in period two . in this case",
    ", the coupling function follows a period - two motion",

    "note the very different distributions of periodic regions for the coupling functions in figs .",
    "3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "it should be noticed that , besides the collective periodic states for two clusters shown in figs .",
    "3(a)-3(d ) , there can exist other states in a gcm system consisting of more than two periodic clusters for the same values of the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath6 , but corresponding to different initial conditions .",
    "the inverse problem of determining the global coupling function in experimental systems is relevant since in general the specific functional form of the acting coupling is not known .",

    "however , if the local dynamics is known some insight on the function @xmath12 of a globally coupled system can be gained within the framework presented here .",

    "@xcite , the clustering behavior of gcm systems can be analyzed through its analogy with the dynamics of a single map subjected to an external drive . in order to interpret the results of the preceding section ,",
    "let us consider an associated driven map @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the state of the map at discrete time @xmath4 , @xmath49 is the same local dynamics as in eq.([gcm ] ) , and @xmath50 is an external driving term assumed to be periodic with period @xmath15 .",

    "the analogy between a gcm system and a driven map arises because in the former system ( eq . ( [ gcm ] ) ) all the elements are affected by the global coupling function in exactly the same way at all times , and therefore the behavior of any element @xmath1 in the gcm is equivalent to the behavior of a single driven map ( eq . ( [ driven ] ) ) with @xmath52 and initial condition @xmath53 .",
    "additionally , if a gcm system reaches a clustered , periodic collective state , its corresponding coupling function @xmath12 follows in general a periodic motion .",
    "thus the associated driven map ( eq . ( [ driven ] ) ) with a periodic drive @xmath50",
    "should display a behavior similar to that of an element belonging to a periodic cluster in the gcm system .",
    "in particular , periodic drives resulting in periodic orbits of @xmath48 in eq .",

    "( [ gcm ] ) ) , regardless of the specific functional form of the global coupling @xmath12 and without doing direct simulations on the entire gcm system .",
    "the driven map is multistable ; i.e. , there can exist several attractors for the same parameter values @xmath46 and @xmath6 . specifically , for a given periodic drive @xmath51 $ ] , the map @xmath48 may reach a number of distinct asymptotic responses @xmath54 ; @xmath55 , all with the same period , and depending on initial conditions .",

    "( [ gcm ] ) with @xmath71 and displaying two clusters in period two will fall on this bounded region of the plane @xmath43 .",
    "equivalently , a collective state of two clusters in period two can emerge in a gcm system only if its global coupling function has an orbit @xmath38 $ ] with values @xmath72 and @xmath73 contained within the bounded region of fig .",
    "the boundaries of that region vary as the parameters @xmath46 and @xmath6 are changed .",
    "it is out of the scope of the present work to establish how the bounded region for two clusters in period two , as well as other regions for different clustered , periodic states , depend on parameters .",
    "however , it is worth noticing that this dependence can serve to characterize gcm systems with permutable coupling functions , and that this characterization can be obtained by the sole use of an associated driven map .",
    "the analogy between a gcm system with a given coupling function @xmath12 in a two - cluster state and an associated driven map can be carried further by defining an associated coupling function @xcite @xmath74 that is , @xmath75 is similar to the reduced two - cluster coupling function , such as eqs.([cluster1])-([cluster2 ] ) but with the arguments @xmath31 and @xmath32 from the cluster trajectories replaced by the driven map orbits @xmath76 and @xmath77",
