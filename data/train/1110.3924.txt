    "the post - agb objects gathered in our catalogue are stars that left the agb but are still not hot enough to ionize the surrounding matter .",
    "this definition does not imply that the objects will become planetary nebulae ( pn ) , since stellar ejecta prior to this stage may have dispersed in the interstellar medium well before the remnant star is hot enough to ionize them .",
    "the second release of the catalogue ( http://www.ncac.torun.pl/postagb2 - szczerba et al .",
    "2011 , a&a in revision ) gives on - line access to about 480 likely and possible post - agb objects , including about 110 rv tau stars & 70 helium stars .",
    "there are also about 70 unlikely post - agb objects , which sometimes are counted in the literature as proto - pne or post - agbs .",
    "the main tool to classify a post - agb candidate is its position in the iras color - color diagram ( ccd ) and its iras variability , supplemented by some additional criteria , if necessary .",
    "we count an object as a likely post - agb if it lies below the dotted line in the ccd ( fig.[fig1 ] ) , has iras variability index smaller than 40 and is not a pn ( ccdpos ) . for objects located above the line we used additional criteria , like",
    ": double peaked 1612 mhz oh maser emission , luminosity class i , etc ",
    "( ccdoth ) . a detailed description of the adopted criteria can be found in szczerba et al .",
    "we have also distinguished a group of m - type post - agb ( ? ) stars ( m - ccdpos ; m - ccdoth ) , which are discussed in sect .",
    "the second release of the catalogue is enriched in : a ) photometry from gsc 2.3 , b ) optical spectra from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* surez  ( 2006 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",

    "photospheric and/or circumstellar .",
    "there are several objects in our catalogue with double - peaked seds and spectral type m implying an effective temperature around 3000k and yet called in the literature post - agb objects .",
    "while double - peaked sed suggests the end of agb phase , the m - type contradicts this conclusion .",
    "however , the only m - type object ( iras 18420 - 0512 ) resolved by hst shows circumstellar arcs ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sahai ( 2007 ) ) ) .",
    "therefore , we postulate that m - type objects are at the end of their  puffing  phase during agb and are just entering the post - agb stage of stellar evolution , so they could be called the  transition post - agb objects  ."
