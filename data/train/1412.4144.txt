    "frobenius algebras are central to the study of quantum field theories , and hence quantum invariants .",

    "the first approach is to extend coefficients to the function field of the character variety to get an algebra @xmath14 over the function field .",
    "the second approach is given a * place * @xmath15 , that is a homomorphism to the complex numbers , we specialize to get an algebra , @xmath16 , over the complex numbers . in most cases ,",
    "the derived algebra , equipped with the most obvious linear functional is a symmetric frobenius algebra .",
    "frobenius algebras are finite dimensional .",
    "identifying a finite generating set over the character ring is central to all our constructions .",
    "the trace that makes the algebra into a symmetric frobenius algebra comes from letting the algebra act on itself by left multiplication and then taking the normalized trace of the resulting linear map .",
    "the construction is agnostic with respect to the meaning of the trace .",
    "a more conceptual approach to constructing the trace is being explored in @xcite .",
    "the ethos of that approach is that the trace comes from understanding the skein module of a connected sum of copies of @xmath17 .    throughout this paper , the notation @xmath18",
    "is used to denote the compact oriented surface of genus @xmath19 with @xmath20 boundary components . after a section broaching the background we study the construction applied to the kauffman bracket skein algebras of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "a framed link in a three - manifold @xmath25 is a disjoint union of oriented annuli in @xmath25 .",
    "the orientation of the annuli can be expressed by saying that each annulus has a preferred side .",

    "finally @xmath30 is the quotient of @xmath27 by the submodule generated by the kauffman bracket skein relations ,    @xmath31 and @xmath32 where the framed links in each expression are identical outside the balls pictured in the diagrams .",
    "you should think of the framed links in the ball as parallel to the arcs shown , with the preferred side up .",
    "a quotient module is made up of cosets of the submodule you are modding out by .",
    "the relators above are more familiarly written as relations between cosets . in that form",

    "the planar surface with three boundary components @xmath22 and the surface of genus one with one boundary component @xmath24 are not homeomorphic , but @xmath42\\cong \\sigma_{1,1}\\times [ 0,1]$ ] . meaning different skein algebras have the same underlying skein module .    a simple diagram @xmath43 on a surface @xmath36 is a system of disjoint simple closed curves so that none of the curves bounds a disk .",
    "we include the empty diagram in this list . by taking an annulus in @xmath36 about each simple closed curve in a diagram @xmath43 and orienting them to coincide with the orientation of @xmath36 we get a framed link corresponding to each simple diagram .",
    "sometimes this is called the _ blackboard framing_. no matter what @xmath44 is used in the kauffman bracket , the isotopy classes of framed links coming from isotopy classes of simple diagrams form a basis for the kauffman bracket skein algebra , @xcite    the tchebychev polynomials of the first type @xmath45 are defined recursively by    * @xmath46 , * @xmath47 and * @xmath48 .",
    "an easy inductive argument confirms that if @xmath49 then @xmath50 .",
    "this last formula can be taken as a characterization among polynomials of the @xmath5th tchebychev polynomial of the first type .    if @xmath51 is a polynomial so that for all @xmath49 , @xmath52 then @xmath53 .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath75 is a ring under disjoint union .",
    "this is because at @xmath76 , the kauffman bracket skein relation says that you can change crossings in a crossing ball of a framed link without changing the equivalence class of the induced skein . to take the product of two equivalence classes of framed links , choose representatives that are disjoint from one another and",
