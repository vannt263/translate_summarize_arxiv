    "many scientists are interested in the study of nanostructures and matters in solid state , but there are many computational and mathematical challenges which cause to slow progress in this way . due to the wideness of the problems ,",
    "the existence of packages and applications will be a big help for scientific progress .",
    "although , it can not be claimed that a package can get answer to all issues , but we can pave the way for scientists via the development of methods and algorithms .",
    "we are interested in the problems which are widely used and still really interesting . in this field",
    ", people study their favorite problems in many ways .",
    "density functional theory is one of the most important methods in which there are several methods and algorithms , and it is still developed by theoreticians and frequently used by people .",
    "dft is commonly applied to calculate the properties of an infinite periodic arrangement of one or more atoms ( the basis ) repeated at each lattice point that describes a highly ordered structure , occurring due to the intrinsic nature of its constituents to form symmetric patterns .",
    "+ electron density is the main player in the dft and the main rules of the game are the two theorems of hohenberg - kohn and kohn - sham which were presented in 1964 and 1965 .",
    "the accuracy of different methods returns to energy terms and different approximations which are added to the hamiltonian , like the exchange - correlation energy that contains all the interacting terms together as a single term .",
    "the rest challenge now is to find out how to express any parameters in terms of electron density and how to deal with the unknown exchange - correlation energy term compatible for any different molecules , solids , and materials .",
    "+ one of the descriptions for xc energy in a parameterized format was done by perdew and zunger ( 1981 ) and perdew and wang ( 1992 ) known as local density approximation ( lda ) and for spin polarized problems local spin - polarized density approximation ( lsda ) .",
    "it has been one of the most commonly used functionals in the accomplishment of the dft before the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) is formulated to generate more accurate xc functionals .",
    "many different forms of gga are named by their authours who have proposed theories such as pw91 ( perdew et al .",
    "1992 , perdew and wang 1992 ) and pbe ( perdew , burke , and ernzerhof 1996 ) . these gga or lda functionals are normally well tabulated and incorporated with the pseudo - potential files .",
    "+ another approach which is used prevalently is tight - binding .",
    "the tight - binding or linear combination of the atomic orbitals ( lcao ) method is a semi - empirical method that is primarily used to calculate the band structure and single - particle bloch states of a material as slater and koster did in 1954 .",
    "the semi - empirical tight - binding method is simple and computationally very fast .",
    "it , therefore , tends to be used in calculations of very large systems , with more than around a few thousand atoms in the unit cell .",
    "there are a number of earlier reviews  @xcite that people working in this field should be aware of . + also , we are strongly interested in calculating statistical properties of systems in both electronic and phononic cases .",
    "the connection between any quantum system and thermodynamics is possible via statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "there are so many thermal properties which are interesting for experimental scientists such as mean energy , free energy , entropy and specific heat which have been formulated for bosons and fermions during many years @xcite .",
    "+ the purpose of this essay is to introduce a new application for quantum simulation , it s name is condensed matter laboratory ( cml ) and is also available for free download at _",
    "http://phdstu.du.ac.ir / m - nakhaee / cml_. cross - platform graphical user interface of cml is written in c++ using native controls and emulates foreign functionality via wxwidgets tools library for gtk , ms windows , and macos .",
    "additional computational packages are written in fortran 90 .",
    "also , blas @xcite and lapack @xcite routines are used for matrix multiplications , solving systems of simultaneous linear equations and eigenvalue problems . to have high performance , portable implementation of message - passing - interface ( mpi ) @xcite",
    "is applied to parallelize computations . for this suppose , we used mpich . + for the moment ,",
    "this compact accumulated outline may be sufficient , and the main structure of the cml application and important topics , including the newly calculated properties , would be explained in the rest of the paper . in each section , we report on the present status of the approaches used in detail .",
    "however , variety of approaches and methods which an application uses , is a strength point and sign of ability , but having a user - friendly environment can be use to help facilitate applying those approaches and methods and handle all attributes entirely .",
    "+ assembling projects in cml is dendriform ( figure [ projects ] ) in which nodes are called calculating boxes . calculating boxes have an input connected to parent box and some outputs connected to children .",
    "boxes , due to their own kind , calculate some properties by inputs which comes from the parent and transmit ouputs to the children as inputs .",
    "each of these calculating boxes makes an important contribution to our understanding of the whole project . before considering",
    "how much cml is flexible and easy to use for the users , it is worth mentioning that , assembling a problem in such a way intercepts reduplicative calculations .        as mentioned in section [ introduction ] , some pre - requisites are necessary for running a typical mpi job and controlling process placement by mpich library on a set of connected computers that work together via a machine file .",
    "it is noticeable that the _ mpirun _ command does nt use the machine file located in the default location of the operating system .",
    "cml works inclusively to set list of hosts on which to launch mpi processes .",
    "one needs to specify ips of the cluster s computers and also the number of nodes of each computer in settings of cml .",
    "note that cml applys these information just in the mpich standard .",
    "cml has different boxes with different attributes and capabilities to do quantum simulations which would be presented in the following .",
    "unit cell is used to visually simplify the crystalline patterns solids arrange themselves in .",
    "having considered it is the least volume consuming repeating structure of any solid , it is also reasonable to look at that is the most basic calculating box for dft calculations .",
    "one can unambiguously describes the unit cell by specifying direct lattice vectors and the set of atomic positions , and kind of atoms .",
    "the variables which are presented in table [ tabelunitcell ] , represent the unit cell calculating box s attributes .",
    "|l||l|   + & unit + & lattice constant + & @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 + & @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 + & list of atoms + & translate to center + & driver + & height + & width +    viewport attribute contains some graphics drivers for different systems .",
    "one can set atoms and variables and use the unit cell options or use available groups @xcite ( tabel [ tabelunitcellgroups ] ) to set vectors automatically for designing a solid and view the unit cell in the viewport .",
    "subsequently , the primitive cell will be calculated for any arbitrary unit - cell vectors .",
    ".available groups in unit cell box [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      density functional theory ( dft ) , a theory which is currently omnipresent in our everyday computational study of atoms and molecules , solids and nano - materials , and which lies at the heart of modern many - body computational technologies .",
    "whereas the discussion in the section [ unitcell ] shows that there is no use for the unit - cell calculating box on its own , the dft box plays an important role to propel project toward other objectives are sought .",
    "dft box gives us a birds - eye view of the density functional theory .",
    "there is however , a further point to be considered .",
    "there is a broad range of issues lying at the foundations of dft which would be confusing to manage all options of this powerful theory and actualy , there are several prudences and remarks that need to be noticed belonging to different solids and matters",
    ". this subject requires experience and understanding of the approaches and a much more in - depth discussion than is possible within the confines of this paper .",
    "anyway , the dft calculating box s attributes are presented in table [ tabeldft ] .     |l||l|   + & solution method + & exchange correlation method + & mesh cutoff + & electronic temperature + & k - grid cutoff + & net charge + & spin polarized + & fix spin + & total spin + atomic orbital sets & variables + density matrix & options + & active + & vectors + mulliken population analysis & options +    as mentioned in section [ introduction ] , the second attribute ( exchange - correlation method ) could be lda or gga . regardless",
    "how lda and gga numerically work , lda considers approximations for the xc energy by accounting for the varying electron densities in a system by assuming electrons see each other locally and gga considers the electron density and its gradient at a given point . by paying more attention to what happens in actual practice before a theory",
    "is formulated , gga would return better results than the lda / lsda description for xc energy .",
    "it is because of the lda which has been becoming less popular and is often considered old - fashioned since the gga coming , which generally describes the xc energy more accurately .",
    "+      band structure box refers to the electronic band structure of a solid which describes the range of energies that an electron within the solid may have and the ranges of energy that it can not have .",
    "there are different methods to calculate band structure , but in cml this box has the receptivity of the dft , optimization or tight - binding boxes as a parent .",
    "band structure box , due to it s parent choose a compatible approach to calculate eigenenergies of the system which was defined in parrent box for each spin .",
    "band structure box contains properties which are presented in table [ tabelbandstructure ] .",
    "the box needs to be initialized by the user for starting the calculation process .",

    "the third attribute in table [ tabelbandstructure ] will calculate brillouin zone for any arbitrary unit - cell vectors which are described in the parent .",
    "+ when it is connected to dft or optimization boxes , this box uses siesta library to optimize the system and calculate the band structure otherwise it uses the utilities of the cml written in fortran 90 using lapack library which are parallelized by mpi standard .",
    "siesta method started in 1995 @xcite and was coupled to several linear - scaling solvers , and coded in the siesta program in 1996 @xcite , a pioneer in linear - scaling dft .",
    "the density of states function @xmath6 is defined as the number of electronic states per unit energy@xmath7volume , for electron energies at energy @xmath8 .",
    "comparatively , in consonance with electrons @xmath9 is defined as the number of phononic modes , for phonon modes at frequency @xmath10 .",
    "the density of states function is important for calculations of the effects based on the band theory like transition probability @xcite .",
    "the actual transition probability depends on how many states are available in both the initial and final energies .",
    "the band structure is not a reliable guide here , since it only tells about the bands along high symmetry directions .",
    "what one needs is the full density of states across the whole brillouin zone , not just the special directions and has to sample the brillouin zone evenly .",
    "also , it appears in calculations of conductivity where it presents the number of mobile states , and in computing scattering rates where it presents the number of final states after scattering in both of electrical and phononic cases @xcite .",
    "+ the parent of this calculating box could be optimization , tight - binding or band structure boxes . with this comment , it is noteworthy to mention that the approach to calculate the density of states depends on the parent s kind chosen by the user .",
    "dos box contains properties presented in table [ tabledos ] .",

    "+ in the tight - binding approximation , this box needs the hamiltonian of the system ( the tight - binding calculating box outputs ) to calculate the density of states @xmath6 of the system as follows :    @xmath13      semi - empirical tight - binding method is an acceptable approximation to hide daintily all information about eigenvectors behind a concept which is called hopping .",
    "the tight - binding description eventually has progressed to treat systems containing up to thousands of atoms and made computer experiments possible for many structures .",
    "proponents of tight - binding , have also developed several computational and theoretical methods to make computations faster .",
    "these days , the methods have been so successful in both accuracy and efficiency that scientists are using them routinely in a wide range . in cml ,",
    "one is able to assemble three kinds of systems : junctions , ribbons and molecules to study .",
    "a junction system can be defined by the following hamiltonian : @xmath14    in which @xmath15 is the hamiltonian of the part @xmath3 ( center , left or right ) and @xmath16 is the coupling matrix between parts @xmath3 and @xmath4 . also , for a ribbon we can define the hamiltonian as fallows : @xmath17    for a molecule there is no coupling and the system can be defined by @xmath18 . in the case of spin",

    "the phonon has energy @xmath20 and wave vector @xmath21 with the frequency @xmath22 as a function of @xmath21 known as the phonon dispersion relation in which @xmath23 refers to the different branches corresponding to the different frequency modes .",
    "the phonon dispersion relation is periodic in the reciprocal lattice , as that of the electron , when a reciprocal lattice vector is added to the @xmath21 .",
    "all unique solutions are then obtained if @xmath21 is restricted to a cell in the reciprocal space which is usually chosen to be the first brillouin zone as the primitive cell .",
    "phonons play a major role in many of the physical properties of condensed matter , like thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity . to calculate the dispersion of a periodic system we need to calculate eigenvalues of the equation    @xmath24    in which @xmath25 is the @xmath21 dependent dynamical matrix of the system @xcite .",
    "@xmath26    in which @xmath27 is the dynamical matrix of the center part and @xmath28 is the coupling matrix between the center and right unit cell .",
    "it should be noted that the hamiltonian must be an hermitian matrix and so @xmath28 is equal to @xmath29 .",

    "understanding electricity is needed to know a wide variety of well - known effects , such as lightning , static electricity and electromagnetic induction .",
