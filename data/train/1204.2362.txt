    "the stochastic , thermally - excited motions within molecular liquids spatially confined on the nanometer scale is still attracting great interest both in fundamental and applied sciences.@xcite in particular , self - diffusion of molecular liquids confined in mesoporous hosts plays a dominant role in catalysis and adsorptive separation.@xcite it has also been discussed with regard to drug delivery applications @xcite and the origin of adsorption - desorption hysteresis found in mesoporous materials.@xcite in terms of fundamental science the brownian motion of molecules in pores a few nanometers across or in microchannels is interesting , since concepts concerning random motions in highly confined , crowded geometries @xcite or for molecules exposed to external fields ( i.e. interaction potentials with the confining walls ) can be scrutinized .",
    "@xcite moreover , the direct relation between stochastic motions and viscous properties of a liquid ( expressed by the stokes - einstein equation ) allows one to explore the fluidity of liquids in nano - scale structures and in the proximity of the confining solid walls by studies of their self - diffusion dynamics .",
    "this is of obvious importance in the emerging field of nano- and microfluidics , where the exploration of these properties can be experimentally very demanding .",
    "@xcite + there is a sizeable number of experimental techniques , most prominently nuclear magnetic resonance , gravimetric uptake measurements , x - ray and light correlation spectroscopy as well as quasi - elastic neutron scattering , which allow one to study diffusion dynamics in nano- and mesoporous matrices .",
    "the advent of monolithic mesoporous hosts with tailorable channels a few nanometers across , e.g. mesoporous alumina and silicon membranes with parallel - aligned channels , have additionally increased the interest in this field and extended the analytical opportunities , for it allows a better and/or simpler comparison of theory and experiment .",
    "@xcite + many studies of diffusion in restricted geometries are aimed at a comparison to the spatially unconfined , i.e. bulk , system . over the years",
    "it has turned out , however , that this comparison is often hampered , if one has to solely rely on diffusion data reported in the literature and extracted with other measurement techniques . even for identical bulk systems different experimental methods",
    "can deliver deviating dynamical properties and upon confinement these differences in the measured quantities can even be more pronounced .",
    "@xcite different methods probe different length scales and thus also different time scales of diffusion processes .",
    "translational self - diffusion in a crowded melt is , however , a highly cooperative phenomenon and can necessitate large scale molecular rearrangements depending on the investigated diffusion length .",
    "this translates to a dependency of the diffusion dynamics on the diffusion length , and thus diffusion time investigated .",
    "this was particularly convincingly demonstrated by seminal molecular dynamics simulations on unconfined , molecular liquids @xcite and is all the more of importance for spatially nano - confined liquids , where the bare geometrical restriction can hamper both the movements of the diffusing molecule as well as the necessary mesoscopic rearrangement of the surrounding molecules .",
    "@xcite + this study tries to circumvent the challenge with respect to the comparability of self - diffusion properties gained by different methods by an investigation of both the bulk and spatially confined dynamics with an identical technique under similar experimental conditions",
    ". we report incoherent quasi - elastic neutron scattering ( iqens ) measurements on liquid n - hexane in tubular channels of 6  nm , that is nine times the length of the molecule .",
    "hence , no single - file diffusion behavior is expected , however the interaction with the attractive confining walls is expected to affect the brownian dynamics . @xcite previous quasi - elastic neutron scattering measurements on liquid hexane in mesoporous silica were interpreted in terms of pronounced reductions in the translational self - diffusion of the molecules in the pore center ( by an order of magnitude in the translational diffusion coefficient ) and an even more slowed - down component in the pore wall vicinity .",
    "@xcite this study was performed with sponge - like , porous silica gel glasses and hence no investigation of anistropic diffusion with regard to the long pore axes was possible , an additional goal of this study . +",
    "liquid hexane was a perfect candidate to study molecular motions in a bulk liquid ( bl ) and spatially confined liquid ( cl ) with iqens techniques at moderate temperatures .",
    "it is a volatile room temperature liquid and in a neutron beam its molecules cause mainly incoherent scattering due to the high content of hydrogen atoms .",
    "other scattering contributions from hydrogen or carbon atoms are not significant .",
    "porous silicon was the preferred host to investigate the cl .",
    "it offered a natural environment to study the effect of nano - confinement and reduced dimensionality on stochastic motions .",
    "its tubular / cylindrical pores have diameters of only a few nanometers but extend to lengths of a few hundred microns therefore creating an effective confinement in two dimensions for guest molecules like hexane .",
    "its pores are parallel - aligned along the @xmath2-direction in single crystalline wafer which in combination with the huge length to diameter ratio not only raises the question whether molecular motions along the pore axis are different from radial motions but also offers the unique opportunity to study these potential anisotropies in selected scattering geometries as discussed in more detail below .",
    "liquid hexane ( @xmath3 ) was stored in sealed bottles in a dry atmosphere of a glove box .",
    "bottles were only removed and opened to prepare bl and cl for the experiments . in this way contamination of hexane with water , which slowly builds up in a humid environment was kept at a minimum .",
    "+ electrochemical anodization in hydrofluoric acid was applied to etch porous structures in @xmath4 m thick single crystalline silicon @xmath2-plates .",
    "anodization parameters as wafer doping , electrolyte concentration , etching time and current were adjusted to facilitate the growth of @xmath5 m thick porous layers whith a total porosity of @xmath6 at a average pore diameter of @xmath7 .",
    "etched substrates were stored in a container with distilled water to prevent contamination with hydrocarbons and only removed for experiments .",
    "+ the bl as well as cl sample were prepared directly at the beamline .",
    "the setup to prepare bl included a traditional helium cryostate , a standard sample stick and a flat aluminum cell .",
    "the indium sealed aluminum cell with a width of 30  mm , a height of 50  mm and a depth of 0.5  mm contained next to the bl several sheets of thin aluminum to reduce the effective thickness of the hexane sample to avoid multiple scattering . + setup and procedure to prepare the cl sample were more sophisticated in order to avoid the formation of excess bulk liquid outside the pores in the filling process .",
    "we employed a sample stick equipped with a stainless steal capillary , an air - tight network of small pipes , gas containers , pressure gages and valves , subsequently refered to as `` gas handling '' and a high vacuum pumping station .",
    "the sample cell was tailored to match the dimensions of the 30  mm wide , 50  mm high and 0.5  mm thick porous matrix .",
    "the stainless steal capillary at the stick acted as narrow pipeline between the sample in the aluminum cell and the external gas handling .",
    "the gas handling itself served as reservoir and distribution system for hexane vapor .",
    "+ the sample cell was evacuated at @xmath8 to @xmath9  mbar before the pores were stepwise filled with liquid hexane .",

    "the molecules physisorb preferentially close to the pore wall.@xcite in the hysteretic regime above the transition pressures @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which relate directly to the pore diameter , capillary condensation occurs in the pore centre @xcite . a detailed discussion of the hysteresis ( @xmath20 )",

    "+ for scattering experiments on cl s , the porous host was filled at @xmath10  k up to only @xmath21 , decoupled from the gas handling and eventually brought on temperature @xmath22 .",
    "consequently all experiments were performed under quasi - isosteric conditions , and scattering contributions from coexisting bl could be ruled out definitely .",
    "if the pore volume was filled up to @xmath21 only at @xmath23  k and the cell was decoupled from the reservoir prior to cooling , the filling fraction of the host with hexane could not change by more than @xmath24 through condensation from coexisting vapor while cooling .",
    "the excess volume of cell and capillary , that is the combined volume of cell and capillary minus the volume of the empty sample , were neglectable compared to the pore volume and did not contain enough hexane vapor to increase the filling of the host significantly .",

    "this population corresponds likely to a flat - lying , strongly adsorbed monolayer of hexane molecules , which sticks to the pore wall , similarly as it has been inferred from ellipsometric and rheological measurements for medium - length n - alkanes in the proximity of silicon and silica surfaces .",

    "it might be a direct result of spatial confinement imposed on molecules in the pores or to some extent an artifact of the simplified fitting approach which only discerns immobile hexane molecules and mobile hexane molecules .",
    "a radial gradient in the diffusion constants , that is bulk diffusivity in the pore centre and a decreasing diffusivity closer to the pore walls , seems to be intuitive and suggested both by molecular dynamics simulations and experiments.@xcite but attempts to apply models that account more clearly for a radial dependence of dynamics failed due to a multitude of strongly correlated fitting parameters and were therefore not suited to perform a reliable and meaningful analysis of the scattering data .",
