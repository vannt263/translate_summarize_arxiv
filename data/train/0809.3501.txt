    "the form factors of lithium-6 are calculated here , following the method developed by braaten and carson that was applied to the deuteron @xcite .",
    "we will also consider the charge form factor of the @xmath1-particle .",
    "we need to consider the full moduli space of skyrmion collective coordinates , including translations , so we make the ansatz for the dynamical skyrme field : @xmath179 form factors are calculated by inserting this ansatz into the expression for the electromagnetic current @xmath180 and determining matrix elements of the resulting operator between quantum states .",
    "@xmath181 is the third component of the isospin current density , and @xmath182 the baryon current ( [ eq : cur ] ) .",
    "the ground state of the quantized @xmath141 skyrmion , which we recall has spin 1 and isospin 0 , is @xmath183 in terms of wigner @xmath138-functions parametrized by the rotational and isorotational euler angles .",
    "@xmath184 is the third component of the space - fixed spin , and @xmath185 is the momentum .",
    "the charge and quadrupole form factors are defined in the breit frame ( i.e. the frame in which the sum of the initial and final momenta is zero ) in terms of the matrix element of @xmath186 between ground states : @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the momentum transfer , @xmath189 , @xmath167 is the skyrmion mass and @xmath190 is the unitary matrix relating the cartesian basis to the spin 1 angular momentum basis .",
    "braaten and carson @xcite obtained a general expression for the matrix element of @xmath186 , which may be simplified to @xmath191 @xmath192 where @xmath193 denote spherical bessel functions and @xmath194 is the baryon density of the skyrmion @xmath103 in its initial orientation .",
    "therefore @xmath195 as @xmath196 , @xmath197 and @xmath198 , where @xmath199 and @xmath200 are the squared mean charge radius and quadrupole moment .",
    "note that @xmath199 is proportional to the derivative of @xmath201 with respect to @xmath202 .",
    "the structure of the lithium-6 nucleus is also described by a magnetic form factor . before going into this",
    ", we will firstly describe the calculation of the magnetic dipole moment of the quantized @xmath141 skyrmion in the skyrme model .",
    "the classical magnetic moment is defined by @xmath203 as the ground state has isospin 0 , the electromagnetic current density @xmath204 is equal to half the baryon current density ( [ eq : cur ] ) , and so @xmath205 inserting the expression for the rotated classical skyrmion ( [ eq : dyn ] ) , we obtain @xmath206 where @xmath207\\right ) d^3x\\,,\\\\ n_{\\alpha k } & = & \\frac{1}{32\\pi^2 } \\int \\epsilon_{krs } x_\\beta x_r\\,\\hbox{tr}\\,\\left(r_s[r_\\alpha , r_\\beta]\\right ) d^3x\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and these are calculated for the unrotated skyrmion",
    ". these matrices are straightforward to calculate approximately using the rational map ansatz .",
    "the @xmath99 symmetry of the skyrmion implies that @xmath208 and @xmath209 are diagonal and satisfy @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "these relations imply that the terms of @xmath212 involving @xmath213 multiply the operator @xmath214 , which annihilates the quantum state of the skyrmion .",
    "we ultimately obtain @xmath215 where @xmath216 is a component of the spatial inertia tensor ( [ eq : v ] ) .",
    "the magnetic dipole moment , @xmath217 , is defined to be the expectation value of @xmath218 between quantum ground states with @xmath219 , and so @xmath220 @xmath217 is calculated to be 0.54 nm ( in physical units ) , which is quite close to the experimental value for lithium-6 of 0.82 nm @xcite .",
    "the magnetic form factor is defined in the breit frame in terms of the matrix elements of the spatial components of the electromagnetic current density between quantum ground states of the @xmath141 skyrmion @xcite : @xmath221 this matrix element is given by @xmath222 from which the magnetic form factor is obtained as : @xmath223 as @xmath196 , @xmath224 . so the static electromagnetic properties are recovered from the electromagnetic form factors in the limit of zero momentum transfer .    in fig .",
    "11 we present a graph of the absolute normalized charge form factor for lithium-6 and for the quantized @xmath141 skyrmion .",
    "there is no method of experimentally separating @xmath201 and @xmath225 . due to the smallness of @xmath225",
    ", we have made the comparison under the assumption that the observed electron scattering cross sections are due entirely to monopole charge scattering .",
    "this is consistent with other approaches @xcite .",
    "we observe that the slopes of the theoretical and experimental form factors agree at @xmath226 .",
    "this was , of course , to be expected as our new parameter set was chosen such that the mean charge radius is correctly predicted .",
    "the first cusp in the form factor is experimentally seen somewhere in the range @xmath227 .",
    "we underpredict the location of this first cusp to be at roughly @xmath228 .",
    "we recall that the skyrmion baryon density vanishes at the centre of the skyrmion , which is unlike the conventional picture of a nucleus with its baryon density having at most a small dip in the centre",
    ". this may be the reason why the form factor cusps appear at too low values of the momentum transfer .",
    "softening the skyrmion by allowing it to vibrate may give a better fit .",
    "in comparison , in fig .",
    "12 we observe that our prediction for the absolute normalized magnetic form factor agrees rather well with experiment .",

    "the cross section for the elastic scattering of electrons off a spin 0 nucleus , such as the @xmath1-particle , depends only on the charge form factor , which is given by @xmath229 in fig .",
    "13 we have plotted the absolute normalized values of the charge form factor of the @xmath1-particle and the quantized @xmath56 skyrmion . certainly , the two graphs have the same qualitative features , with the appearance of cusps in both cases .",
    "however , again our predicted cusps appear at smaller values of momentum transfer than the experimental cusps .",
    "another thing to note is that we overpredict the magnitude of the slope of @xmath201 at @xmath226 , and correspondingly overpredict the mean charge radius of the nucleus .",
    "a further reparametrization of the skyrme model , simultaneously leading to an accurate mean charge radius and to the correct location of the first cusp might be worth investigating .",
    "new data on the form factors of light nuclei are currently being collected at jlab and preliminary results indicate a second cusp in the charge form factor of the @xmath1-particle @xcite .",
    "skyrmion ( solid ) compared with experimental data for helium-4 ( dots ) @xcite.,width=377 ]",
    "the work presented here has certainly provided support for skyrme s field theoretical model for nuclei . in the skyrme model ,",
    "the individual @xmath45 skyrmions merge and lose their identities in the skyrmion solutions with @xmath125 , which is unlike conventional nucleon potential models .",
    "this may capture an essential feature of nuclei in the configurations where nucleons are as close together as possible .",
    "it leads to a new geometry with which to describe nuclei .",
    "our constraints on the allowed quantum numbers of states provide indirect support for this geometrical picture .",
    "the results which we have obtained for energy levels agree well with experiment , and the new parameter set which we proposed has enabled us to more accurately estimate properties of nuclei over a wider range than before .",
    "we have made predictions of a number of excited states of nuclei that have not been seen experimentally .",
    "this includes the prediction of a spin 4 state of helium-4 , with an excitation energy higher than those of the experimentally established states .",
    "we have also predicted new spin 0 , negative parity ground states of lithium-8 and boron-8 .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of our form factors is in quite good agreement with experiment , and the symmetries of the classical skyrmions do not lead to contradictions with experiment .",
    "the approach here is the semiclassical method of quantization , which unifies the treatment of spin and isospin excitations .",
    "we have quantized the collective coordinates for translations , rotations and isospin rotations , while ignoring further degrees of freedom , which are referred to as vibrational modes .",
    "allowing the individual skyrmions , or subclusters of skyrmions , to move relative to each other , and performing a quantization of these degrees of freedom , would be a significant refinement .",
    "we have mainly used the rational map ansatz , which gives good approximations for small baryon numbers , but can not easily be extended to higher @xmath6 . with our collaborators battye and sutcliffe , we have recently started working with the numerically determined , exact skyrmion solutions including @xmath230 and @xmath68 , in order to model the corresponding nuclei , including boron-10 and carbon-12 . despite achieving considerable success in describing nuclei with even @xmath6 , we would like to understand better the odd baryon number sectors of the model .",
    "we have worked with the standard @xmath0 skyrme model .",
    "the inclusion of strange quarks in the model would be a further refinement .",
    "the introduction of explicit vector meson fields leads to an improved description of the short - range structure of the nucleons @xcite .",
    "this could lead to further refinement of the modelling of nuclei , but not much is known about skyrmions with @xmath125 in these extended models .",
    "recent work by sakai and sugimoto and others has given further credence to the idea that at large @xmath231 , baryons and nuclei are described by some variant of the skyrme model @xcite .",
