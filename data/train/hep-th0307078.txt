    "the large @xmath7 behavior is simply coulombic .",
    "however , at small @xmath7 , this coulombic behavior is truncated . because the supersymmetry breaking is soft , a mass - level `` supersymmetric '' organization of the open string modes @xcite yields a finite effective potential , as shown in fig 1 . for @xmath4 , the open string spectrum level crossing and the unbounded growth in the `` soft '' supersymmetry breaking for massive modes",
    "is qualitatively different from the small @xmath6 case @xcite .",
    "we shall see that the scalar modes @xmath11 ( there are @xmath12 of them ) are also tachyonic when the @xmath3-brane is on top of the @xmath13-brane .",
    "their tachyonic property is due to quantum effects ( radiative correction ) , a feature first seen in ref@xcite for small @xmath6 .    in the open string one - loop channel ,",
    "since only the tachyon mode contribution has an imaginary part at the one - loop level , the evaluation of @xmath14 is completely field theoretic @xcite .",

    "that is , the closed string channel , we should obtain exactly the same result . for large separation @xmath7 , one obtains the well - known coulombic potential @xcite , due to the ns - ns and rr exchanges , which correspond to the attractive gravitational and rr forces . as we go to short distances , the massive closed string modes that are yukawa - suppressed start contributing to the potential @xmath4 . as @xmath17",
    ", we see that ( naively ) the potential diverges .",
    "this apparent divergence appears when the hagedorn - like degeneracy overcomes the yukawa suppression .",

    "a regularization ( that is , an analytic continuation of the integral ) renders the result finite , but with an imaginary part , as expected , precisely reproducing the result ( [ imagvww ] ) obtained in the open string channel .",

    "here , the finite imaginary part appears due to the hagedorn - like degeneracy of the massive closed string modes , and the analytic continuation moves the closed string modes from off - shell to on - shell .",
    "the decay first goes to very massive , non - relativistic on - shell bosonic closed string modes @xcite , with transverse momentum very small compared to the mass @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "these non - relativistic massive modes then decay to relativistic light closed string modes , both bosonic and fermionic .",
    "intuitively , this is quite reasonable , since the imaginary part of the effective potential should be related to some decay width .",
    "the above decay width is obtained perturbatively so it is expected to go to perturbative modes , i.e. , closed and/or open string modes . in the decay of a non - bps @xmath3-brane , there is no brane left after the decay , so no open string modes can be present . since only closed string modes are present at the end of the decay , the decay width @xmath25 should be a measure of the decay to closed string modes .",
    "( lower dimensional branes are solitonic , which are non - perturbative , so their production during the decay should not be included in @xmath25 . )    although @xmath30 is clearly related to the decay of the @xmath0 pair , it is harder to interpret @xmath31 as its decay to closed strings .",

    "the way we identify the grouping as the angle @xmath6 between the branes increases from zero to @xmath53 is by following the spectral flow , that is , the splitting of open string modes at each level due to the soft supersymmetric breaking .",
    "this splitting leads to unequal contributions from the bosons and the fermions , resulting in a finite potential between the brane and the antibrane .",
    "let us first review the branes - at - an - angle case . for simplicity , let us consider the case of two @xmath544-branes at an angle @xmath6 .    the potential for two @xmath544-branes at an angle @xmath6 in the open string one - loop channel",

    "the open string spectrum splits into copies of the ( broken ) supermultiplet .",
    "the susy breaking is due to the `` expectation value '' @xmath6 , which is a soft susy breaking , so that , for any @xmath7 , _ i(-1)^fm_i^2n=0 , n=1,2,3 where @xmath74 runs over the spectrum in each `` softly broken '' supermultiplet ( corresponding to a @xmath75 supermultiplet ) .",

    "so the analysis of the one - loop open string effective potential in this case is identical to that for @xmath22 , and we obtain @xmath132 as given in ( [ imav ] ) with @xmath133 . performing the @xmath38-integration in ( [ closedvz ] ) at @xmath24 , we obtain [ vprop ] < dp|   |dp > = = -_j where the sum is over closed string modes .",
    "recall that a(dp    dp ) _ j _ j i(k^2-m_j^2 ) |f_j|^2 [ factor ] where , ignoring momenta @xmath134 parallel to the brane , @xmath135 .",
    "we see that @xmath136 is a constant independent of the closed string mode @xmath137 , and that the imaginary part comes only from on - shell closed string modes .    before analytic continuation , @xmath22 is real and infinite , with @xmath138 . after analytic continuation , @xmath22 becomes finite with an imaginary part .",
    "a comparison of ( [ vprop ] ) , ( [ closedvz ] ) and ( [ factor ] ) suggests that the analytic continuation moves the propagators on - shell , that is , @xmath139 is due to the sum over the on - shell poles .",
    "since the divergence comes from large @xmath104 , it further suggests that most of @xmath139 comes from massive on - mass - shell closed string modes . for the massive closed string states , the poles get so dense for large @xmath104 that they are well represented by a branch cut .",
    "our prescription for regularizing the divergence and isolating the imaginary part is equivalent to applying the @xmath140 prescription of the analytic continuation to all asymptotically massive closed string modes and moving them on - shell .",
    "so @xmath141 should be interpreted as the decay width of a non - bps @xmath3-brane into on - mass - shell closed string modes .",
    "we may see this a little more clearly by separating the regularization procedure into 2 steps : first go on - shell and then perform the analytic continuation . ignoring @xmath134 , we may restore the @xmath142 integral and rewrite ( [ vprop ] ) as ~^dndk_^9-pdk_0 ( k^2 - 4n/ ) ( k_0 ) + dk_^9-p_0^ dk_0 where the sum over @xmath137 is replaced by an integration over @xmath100 , with measure @xmath105 . carrying out the @xmath104-integration with the delta function keeps only the on - mass - shell states . using the asymptotic form of @xmath105 ( [ an ] ) , we find that @xmath143 .",
    "this integral is divergent .",
    "after the analytic continuation of this expression , the integral becomes finite and obtains an imaginary part . presumably , the inclusion of subleading terms of @xmath105 will reproduce the correct @xmath144 . in fig .",
    "2 , only bosonic closed string modes are involved .",
    "they are the ns - ns and rr modes . in ( [ closedvz ] )",
    "( with @xmath24 ) , we see that @xmath145 has a gaussian distribution , with @xmath146 . from ( [ zas ] ) and ( [ acontour ] )",
    ", we have @xmath147 . putting them together",
    ", we see that , for massive states , so the momenta of the massive closed string modes transverse to the brane are negligible .",
    "conservation of momenta tangential to the brane implies that they are negligible too .",
    "since it is the large @xmath104 behavior that brings in the imaginary part , the decay is to very massive non - relativistic closed string modes , as pointed out in ref @xcite .",
    "these massive closed string modes will then decay to light ( both bosonic and fermionic ) closed string modes , which are expected to be relativistic .",
    "apriori , the tachyon couples to other open string modes and the decay of a non bps @xmath3-brane corresponds to the rolling of the tachyon @xcite , so one naively expects some energy to go to open string modes .",
    "however , no open string mode exists after the complete decay ( and the disappearance ) of the brane .",
    "this issue is resolved in ref@xcite : one expects the ends of an open string mode to have a flux tube ( @xmath148 ) between them , so that the flux tube together with the open string form a closed string . as a result , only closed string modes are produced .",
    "the estimate of @xmath25 is for the tachyon at or close to the top of the potential ( at @xmath149 ) .",
    "the time scale @xmath150 of the tachyon rolling is around @xmath151 . in the compactified case",
    "where the world volume @xmath152 , @xmath150 is comparable to or larger than the inverse of @xmath25 . in this case , the above estimate of @xmath25 should be valid . for @xmath150",
    "much smaller than @xmath153 , we may expect the decay to start with the tachyon rolling , which goes to tachyon matter @xcite , which then decays to relativistic closed strings . in this case , the above estimate may not be applicable .",
    "@xmath3-branes in the bosonic string theory may also be considered : = _ 0^ds   e^s _ m=1^ ( 1 - e^-ms)^-24 + _ 0^ ds   e^s  z_b(s ) for @xmath118 , @xmath154 so the degeneracy @xmath155 .",
    "this yields for @xmath114 and @xmath156 ( ignoring powers of @xmath80 and @xmath157 ) , ~_0^ dt dv ( -2 ( v - t)^2/t + 2 t ) completely analogous to ( [ closedvn ] ) , the last term in the exponent is identified as @xmath158 with the tachyon mass @xmath159 .",
    "this is the origin of the apparent divergence in the integration over @xmath80 . using the @xmath108 form of @xmath160 in @xmath20 ,",
    "we obtain , after analytic continuation , the expression ( [ imagvww ] ) for @xmath161 , with @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "following the earlier analysis , we see that subleading terms of @xmath160 do not contribute to @xmath164 .",
    "it is suggestive to take @xmath165 ( [ imav ] ) to be the decay width of the @xmath3-@xmath13-brane pair to closed strings , since perturbatively , only closed strings are available after their annihilation",
    ". it will be important to understand this issue better .",
    "for branes at an angle @xmath6 , the branes recombine as @xmath166 .",
    "perturbatively , we expect the decay to release energy to both open and closed strings .",
    "it is interesting to compare this result to that in quantum field theory . in quantum field theory ,",
    "the propagator of a single field at the tree level has only @xmath47 finction as its imaginary part .",
    "here the imaginary part appears classically due to the hagedorn - like degeneracy of the closed string spectrum .",
    "however , this is a perturbative quantum effect in the open string channel .",
    "we thank nick jones , finn larsen , hong liu and raul rabadan for valuable discussions .",
    "this material is based upon work supported by the national science foundation under grant no .",
    "let @xmath167 be given by : ( s ) = _ m=1^ = _ 0^ ( n)w^n where @xmath168 . using complex variables , we can write : @xmath169 , where ( n)= dw where the contour is a circle around the origin . to find the asymptotic form of @xmath170 , we write : ( s)= d f(2s ) - 2d f(s ) where @xmath171 can be expressed in the mellin representation : f(s ) = _ n=1^(1 - e^-ns ) = - _ re(z)=cdz(z)(1+z)(z)s^-z , where @xmath172 , and @xmath173 is the riemann zeta - function .",
    "the integrand has a first - order pole at @xmath174 and a second - order pole at @xmath175 .",
    "shifting the line of integration from @xmath176 to @xmath177 we arrive at : f(s ) = - - ( ) - _ re(z ) = c^dz(z)(1+z)(z)s^-z . letting @xmath178 and using the identities : & & ( z)= 2^z^z-1()(1-z ) ( 1-z ) , + & & ( z)(1-z)= , one obtains : f(s ) = - - ( ) + _ re(z)=c^dz(z ) ( 1+z)(z)()^-z , where @xmath179 .",
    "finally we move the path of integration to the right side of the first - order pole at @xmath180 and get the hardy - ramanujan formula : f(s ) = - ( ) + + f ( ) in the limit @xmath181 , and one obtains the asymptotic behavior of @xmath182 as : ( s ) ( ) ^ e^ using this result and carrying out a saddle point evaluation of the contour integral , we get : [ a2 ] ( n)()^(d+1)/4n^-(d+3)/4 e^ ( 1 - + ... ) for general @xmath38 , ( s)= + ( ) -de^-2 ^ 2/s+ e^-4 ^ 2/s- e^-6 ^ 2/s+e^-8 ^ 2/s + ..... this leads to the following asymptotic expansion for @xmath182 : [ a3 ] ( s)= ( ) ^ e^          g.  dvali and s .- h .",
