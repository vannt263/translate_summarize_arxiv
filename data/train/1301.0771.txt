    "<S> we calculate the transient absorption of an isolated attosecond pulse by helium atoms subject to a delayed infrared ( ir ) laser pulse . with the central frequency of the broad attosecond spectrum near the ionization threshold , </S>",
    "<S> the absorption spectrum is strongly modulated at the sub - ir - cycle level . given that the absorption spectrum results from a time - integrated measurement , we investigate the extent to which the delay - dependence of the absorption yields information about the attosecond dynamics of the atom - field energy exchange . we find two configurations in which this is possible . </S>",
    "<S> the first involves multi photon transitions between bound states that result in interference between different excitation pathways . </S>",
    "<S> the other involves the modification of the bound state absorption lines by the ir  field , which we find can result in a sub - cycle time dependence only when ionization limits the duration of the strong field interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> attosecond transient absorption ( ata ) studies provide a way to push our understanding of the energy transfer between electromagnetic fields and matter to the sub - femtosecond time scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they are an all - optical attosecond metrology that complements methods based on the measurement of charged particles , such as attosecond streaking @xcite and electron interferometry @xcite . like those methods , </S>",
    "<S> high time - resolution is gained in an ata  spectrometer by using attosecond extreme ultraviolet ( xuv ) pulses that are synchronized to the field oscillations of an infrared ( ir ) laser pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the first ata  experiments used an attosecond pulse to probe a valence electron wave packet ( ewp ) created by ionizing an atom with a strong ir  laser pulse @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent ata  experiments have used attosecond pulses as a _ pump _ that creates an ewp  which is then probed by a moderately strong ir  field . in this xuv - pump / </S>",
    "<S> ir - probe configuration the frequency - resolved transient absorption signal varies as a function of the ir  intensity , duration , and the sub - cycle timing between the two fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these experiments raise the possibility of studying time - dependent absorption down to the attosecond time scale .    in this theoretical study , </S>",
    "<S> similar to recent experiments @xcite , we consider helium atoms that are excited by an isolated attosecond pulse ( iap ) with a central frequency near the ionization threshold , together with a delayed few - cycle ir   pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate the key features of the resulting delay - dependent attosecond absorption ( ddaa ) spectra . </S>",
    "<S> these features derive from the fact that the iap   `` starts the clock '' by exciting the system at a well - defined time , and that it makes an ewp   that is essentially independent of the pump - probe delay . </S>",
    "<S> the ddaa  measurement is a spectrogram that records the interference between different excitation pathways which lead to the same absorption or emission processes . </S>",
    "<S> because the attosecond pulse is locked to the ir  field oscillations , it is suggestive that many of the features in the spectrum are modulated at half the ir  laser period ( @xmath0 ) , about 1.3 fs . </S>",
    "<S> however , the absorption spectrum results from the time - integrated response of everything that happens after the initial xuv  excitation , which complicates the analysis . </S>",
    "<S> our main concern in this paper is the connection between these oscillations and the real - time attosecond dynamics .    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two distinct manifestations of attosecond dynamics in the ddaa  spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> first , near the ionization threshold the delay - dependent absorption exhibits fully modulated interference fringes at half the ir  period . </S>",
    "<S> we show these are due to the interference between two pathways , separated in time , which give rise to the same dipole response . </S>",
    "<S> this `` which way '' quantum path interference @xcite can be used to time - resolve two photon transitions between excited states , and shows how the absorption at xuv  frequencies is altered on a sub - cycle time scale . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath1 oscillations with a similar origin in absorption features associated with non - linear xuv+ir  processes , which appear as light - induced structures in the ata  spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> these fringes illustrate how energy can be exchanged between excitation modes ( dressed states ) that exist only when the xuv  and ir  fields overlap in time . the second feature results from the ir  driven sub - cycle ac stark shift of the lower - lying @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the time - dependent stark shift leads to a dispersive line - shape , which results from interference between the time - dependent dipole induced before , during , and after the ir  pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , due to the integrated nature of the absorption spectrum , a measurement of the instantaneous energy shift is only possible when ionization limits the interaction time </S>",
    "<S> .    the essential features of ddaa  spectra can be understood at the single atom level . </S>",
    "<S> the energy lost or gained by a light field in the interaction with an atom can be described by a frequency - dependent response function @xmath4 $ ] , where @xmath5 is the pump - probe delay ( we use atomic units unless otherwise indicated ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the fourier transforms of the time - dependent dipole moment @xmath8 and the total driving field @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the dipole moment is obtained by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) in the single - active - electron approximation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 shows a typical response function vs pump - probe delay . </S>",
    "<S> the 25 ev , 330 as iap  pump pulse has a bandwidth of 5.5 ev , which means that it overlaps all the singly excited and low - energy continuum states of the he atom . </S>",
    "<S> the fwhm of the 800 nm probe pulse is 11 fs , corresponding to 4 optical cycles ( @xmath10  fs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the ir  field is of moderate intensity , so that it can not itself excite the atom in its ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the pump and probe fields have parallel linear polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> we include a dipole dephasing time @xmath11 fs in the calculations by smoothly windowing the dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that using a longer @xmath12 does not change any of our conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> positive ( negative ) values of @xmath13 mean that a dilute gas will absorb ( emit ) energy at frequency @xmath14 as the dipole - driven source term in the wave equation will be out of ( in ) phase with @xmath7 @xcite .     </S>",

    "<S> the ir  intensity oscillations are shown in black in the top panel . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we begin by briefly describing the main features in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> for large positive delays , @xmath19 , the iap  arrives after the end of ir  pulse and the absorption spectrum exhibits only one - xuv - photon transitions from the ground state to the n@xmath20 states . when the two pulses overlap , @xmath21 , these absorption features are strongly modified . in this same delay range , light - induced structures ( liss ) </S>",
    "<S> appear , for example , between the @xmath2 and @xmath3 resonant lines . </S>",
    "<S> these are associated with two - photon ( xuv @xmath22 ir ) processes that transfer population from the ground state to non - dipole coupled ( `` dark '' ) @xmath23 and @xmath24 states , and have recently been observed experimentally @xcite . finally , when the iap  arrives before the ir   pulse , @xmath25 , the dipole established by the xuv  pulse undergoes free decay until the ir  pulse arrives and strongly modified the dipole , which induces sidebands on the main resonance features .    </S>",
    "<S> many of the features in @xmath26 show a modulation at one half the laser period . </S>",
    "<S> of particular interest are fringes that are present both when the pulses overlap and when the iap  arrives before the ir . </S>",
    "<S> an example is seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 between 24.2 and 24.8 ev near the label `` @xmath27 '' , also shown in more detail in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phase](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> these fringes are caused by quantum interference between two distinct pathways for establishing the same coherence between the ground state and a group of n@xmath20 states ( @xmath28 ) , near threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the process is diagrammed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ phase](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the direct pathway is an xuv - driven 1st - order process that populates all of the n@xmath20 states simultaneously in a manner that is independent of the delay . </S>",
    "<S> the indirect pathway is a 3rd - order process in which amplitude in the 2@xmath20 states is transferred to an n@xmath20 state by a two - ir - photon process . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the indirect pathway via the @xmath2 state is confirmed by a test calculation which dynamically eliminates the @xmath2 state during the time - propagation of the tdse , in which these fringes disappear . </S>",
    "<S> the two interfering processes , since they are driven by the xuv  field and the ir  field respectively , happen at different times depending on the value of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting interference fringes are analogous to those observed in photoelectron spectra @xcite , however , in ddaa  the multiphoton process need not result in ionization .    </S>",
    "<S> having identified the interfering pathways it is straightforward to write down the constructive interference condition as a function of delay : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the energies of the @xmath32 and @xmath2 states respectively , and @xmath33 is a positive integer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> two additional parameters enter : @xmath34 is a phase due to the two - ir - photon transition and @xmath35 is the time when the two photon transition probability peaks . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to choose @xmath36 due to the sine - like ir  carrier wave used in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> this formula correctly predicts a decreasing slope for the fringes as @xmath37 increases , corresponding to increasing @xmath33 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ condition ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fit to the interference fringes using @xmath38 , one set of integers @xmath33 that start with @xmath39 at @xmath35 , and no other free parameters , is excellent for @xmath40 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phase](b ) . for @xmath41 the biggest contribution to </S>",
    "<S> the indirect pathway comes from whatever ir  field maximum follows the xuv  pulse ( never more than one half cycle away ) . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the fringes should therefore saturate for @xmath41 , which is indeed what we observe in fig .  1 . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus conclude that the strength of the two photon transition peaks at the local intensity maxima of the ir  field . </S>",
    "<S> this supports a time - dependent picture of multi - photon absorption below threshold as a process that follows the sub - cycle oscillations of the ir  electric field .     </S>",

    "<S> comparison of absorption maxima and the constructive interference condition ( white dashed curves ) for a narrow range of frequencies and ir  wavelengths of ( b ) 800 nm ( same as fig .  1 ) and ( c ) 660 nm . , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    </S>",
    "<S> one application of this 1st vs.  3rd order interference process is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phase](a ) . realizing that the indirect pathway is enhanced due to a near one - ir - photon resonance with the intermediate @xmath44 state </S>",
    "<S> , it seems possible that we can use this to determine @xmath45 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ condition ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> for an 800 nm pulse we can safely assume that @xmath38 because the intermediate @xmath44 state lies above the energy reached by absorbing one ir  photon from the @xmath2 state . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phase](c ) we have repeated the calculation in fig .  1 using a wavelength of 660 nm . since the absorption of one photon now reaches an energy above the @xmath44 state , we expect this phase should shift by @xmath46 . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ phase](c ) we use @xmath47 for the same @xmath35 and achieve an excellent fit to the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the interference fringes can therefore be used to measure the phase of an intermediate resonance if the pulse wavelength can be scanned  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another , more speculative application , is as a probe of decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> a short decoherence time would reduce the fringe contrast for large negative delays , from which the time scale for decoherence could be inferred directly .    </S>",
    "<S> we can apply a similar analysis to the liss as well . in the overlap region ( @xmath21 ) </S>",
    "<S> each lis is associated with an @xmath23 or @xmath24 bound state which is coupled to the ground state by one xuv  photon and the absorption or emission of an additional ir  photon . </S>",
    "<S> we use a plus or minus label for lis that are one photon above or below the final @xmath23 or @xmath24 state . </S>",
    "<S> liss associated with coupling of the ground state to the @xmath44 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 states can be seen near 21.3 ev ( @xmath50 ) , 21.7 ev ( @xmath51 ) , and 22.1 ev ( @xmath52 ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> similar liss are visible above threshold ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the half cycle modulations in the liss come from the 2@xmath56 coupling of plus and minus liss , which have an atomic state as an intermediate resonance . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the @xmath57 is two - photon resonantly coupled to the @xmath58 ( visible near 25 ev around @xmath59 ) , yielding oscillations that are are exactly out of phase with each other . </S>",
    "<S> these couplings can also be confirmed by examining the tilt of the lis interference fringes . </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) predicts that the fringes of the @xmath57 have a negative slope with respect to delay , which is indeed the case in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . however , the fringes in @xmath60 lis have a positive slope , characteristic of being above the final @xmath49 state </S>",
    "<S> . fits to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) using the lis energies show that the two photon transitions between liss also follow the ir  electric field oscillation .    a time - dependent perspective on these oscillations is provided by the observation that the coupling between the one - xuv - photon resonant n@xmath20 state and nearby dark states is in a regime where the rotating wave approximation breaks down , and that the short duration of the iap  yields a well - defined phase of the ir  field at excitation . in such situations it has been demonstrated that the final state populations are sensitive to the phase of the laser at the time of excitation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we have shown that the ddaa  spectrum shows the same sensitivity .    </S>",
    "<S> another source of fast dynamics in the transient absorption spectrum is the sub - cycle ac stark shift of the bound state energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figs . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) and ( b ) show the evolution of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 line shapes with delay , which include both emission and absorption . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , this results from the redistribution of xuv  energy across the resonances due to the perturbation of the dipole by the ir  field . </S>",
    "<S> similar dispersive line shapes have been discussed previously in connection with the control of exciton polarizations of a quantum dot using picosecond laser pulses @xcite .    in a time - domain picture , the dispersive shape of the n@xmath20 absorption lines </S>",
    "<S> is caused by multiple contributions to the dipole moment : ( i ) a perturbed response during the ir  pulse , and ( ii ) free decay of the coherence after the ir  pulse ends @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relative importance of these terms is determined by the ir  field intensity and delay , as well as @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> if the state amplitude is unchanged by the ir  field then the main contribution to the dipole moment comes from the free decay which , however , acquires a phase shift , @xmath61 , equal to the integrated optical stark shift during the time when the ir  pulse acts . in this approximation the response is given by @xmath62\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the difference @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the lorentzian line shape in the absence of the ir  field . for positive delays @xmath66 </S>",
    "<S> we find that the line shape is well described by this simple form . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the shift of the absorption is in the _ direction _ of the stark shift , but the magnitude of the shift is proportional to @xmath67 and is therefore constrained by the natural linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for these delays , the 2@xmath20 and 3@xmath20 lines have stark shifts of opposite sign , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) , but the magnitude of these shifts does not generally equal the instantaneous stark shift .        at delays near zero ( @xmath68 ) </S>",
    "<S> the lineshape becomes much wider than 1/@xmath12 and more complex than the simple dispersive shape discussed above . here </S>",
    "<S> depopulation of the excited states by the ir  field plays a larger role ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3(d - e ) ) , and the response is dominated by the perturbed dipole decay . for the 3@xmath20 state </S>",
    "<S> the loss is predominantly by one photon ionization to the continuum and the dipole response exists for only a few laser cycles after it is excited . </S>",
    "<S> this rapid ionization - induced dephasing allows us to probe the real - time sub - cycle dynamics using a delay - dependent method : during this time ( near -2@xmath0 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(c ) ) we observe a large transient shift of the 3@xmath20 feature of about 0.19 ev , comparable to the ponderomotive energy of 0.18 ev , and strong half cycle oscillations in the peak position , showing the rapid variation in the energy of the resonance as it follows the ir  field oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> these observations are in line with other investigations which show that the stark shift is difficult to observe optically in the absence of rapid dephasing @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means that observing fast dynamics via ionization - induced dephasing requires careful control of the ir  intensity . in the continuum , however , all states have a very short dephasing time , so we always observe an overall ponderomotive shift of the absorption , though the response is very weak .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of the peak of the @xmath2 lineshape is more complex than the 3@xmath20 , in part because the 2@xmath20 is never fully depopulated during the ir  pulse ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( d ) ) , and in part because of the strong coherent coupling between the 2@xmath20 state and the nearby dark states . </S>",
    "<S> the 2@xmath20 lineshape therefore always results from both perturbed and free decay . </S>",
    "<S> the sub - cycle oscillations of the @xmath2 position are most likely due to the which - way interference with the @xmath32 states discussed in the context of fig .  2 , judging from the negative and changing slope of the fringes between @xmath69 and @xmath70 ( as seen in fig .  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as such they do _ not _ contain information about the sub - cycle ac stark shift .    for delays @xmath71 the iap  and ir  act separately : the dipole established by the iap  oscillates freely until the ir  pulse strongly perturbs it , greatly altering the dipole amplitude and phase in a few ir  cycles . </S>",
    "<S> this perturbed free polarization decay has been observed previously at optical frequencies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it yields sidebands , seen clearly above the 3@xmath20 and below the 2@xmath20 lines , with a characteristic hyperbolic shape that depends on the delay as @xmath72 and shows no attosecond time scale dynamics .    to conclude , </S>",
    "<S> we have identified two configurations where attosecond dynamics can be observed in attosecond transient absorption spectra : which - way interference and the sub - cycle ac stark shift . since experimental observations always result from propagation in a macroscopic gas , we also solve the maxwell wave equation ( mwe ) for the time propagation of light fields through the atomic helium gas medium , in which the polarization and ionization source terms are obtained by solving the single - atom tdse  @xcite . the absorption / emission probability after propagation of a dilute gas is almost identical to the single atom result in fig .  1 , exhibiting both the half - cycle modulations , the liss , and the emission features discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that our ddaa  predictions can be observed using current attosecond technology , especially as it regards half - ir - cycle oscillations .    </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that interference fringes in ddaa  spectra result from the coherent addition of two quantum paths that lead to the same dipole excitation . </S>",
    "<S> they reveal the time delay between the initial excitation and a later , ir - field driven multiphoton transition . </S>",
    "<S> this was found to be true both for transitions between bound states as well as between excitation modes ( the liss ) that are observable only when the pulses overlap . </S>",
    "<S> we expect therefore that they will be a general feature in more complex systems @xcite , and could be observed between resonant states embedded in a continuum , as long as the lifetimes are longer that the ir  period . </S>",
    "<S> using this argument in reverse , the interference fringes visible in the ddaa  spectrum could be used as a precise timing device , a probe of decoherence , or a phase meter when an intermediate resonance is involved . </S>"
