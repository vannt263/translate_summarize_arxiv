    "since its discovery in 2004 , graphene has continued to attract considerable attention because of its high carrier mobility and the gate tunability of its charge carrier density . recently , there has been an increasing interest in the physics of multilayer graphene and its application to novel electronic and optical devices @xcite .",
    "multilayer graphene shows a distinctive band structure that is different from that of single layer graphene .",
    "for example , bilayer graphene has a tunable band gap semiconductor @xcite and trilayer graphene has a unique electronic structure consisting of massless ( linear ) and massive ( quadratic ) subband dispersions @xcite .",
    "one of the most distinct electronic properties of multilayer graphene compared to single layer graphene is the subband formation due to the interlayer coupling between layers .",
    "the energy difference between the subbands is usually on the order of interlayer coupling .",
    "thus , in order to reveal the interesting physics related to the higher subbands , it is necessary to increase the carrier density up to the point that the higher subbands are occupied .",
    "however , most study on graphene properties has focused on the low carrier density regime ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) and near the dirac point @xcite .",
    "recent experimental developments make it possible to induce charge carrier densities up to @xmath2 @xmath1 through polymer electrolyte gating @xcite and ionic - liquid gating @xcite , thereby demonstrating the unusual transport properties of multilayer graphene . even though a monotonic increase in conductivity with carrier density is usually observed in monolayer graphene @xcite , nonlinear conductivity behaviors in multilayer graphene",
    "have been experimentally reported at high carrier densities @xcite .",
    "the observed nonmonotonic conductivity behavior is closely related to the carrier occupation of the higher subbands in multilayer graphene .",
    "however , the detailed electronic mechanisms for the nonlinear transport behavior have not yet been investigated .    in this paper",
    ", we study the electronic transport properties of multilayer graphene , focusing on the effect of multiband scattering at high carrier densities . from a simple tight - binding hamiltonian",
    ", we calculate the dc conductivity within the coupled multiband boltzmann transport theory and relaxation time approximation , considering both charged coulomb impurities and short - range scatterers ( e.g. , lattice defects , vacancies , and dislocations ) among which , short - range scatterers play a more significant role in scattering at high carrier densities and are the main scattering source , limiting the graphene mobility at high carrier densities @xcite . we show that as carrier density increases , the interplay of the allowed scattering channels , enhanced screening , and chiral nature of the electronic structure determines the transport properties of the multiband scattering in multilayer graphene . because the scattering rate is directly proportional to the density of states ( dos ) , and the dos is enhanced at the bottom of the subbands , we find that the conductivity of multilayer graphene shows a sudden change when charge carriers begin to occupy the higher subbands .",
    "the change in conductivity arises mainly from the intersubband scattering due to the enhanced dos at the band touching point .",
    "in particular , rhombohedral ( periodic abc ) graphene shows a large conductivity drop when charge carriers fill the higher subband because of the diverging dos at the bottom of the subbands . using this unusual conductivity drop at the band touching point , we propose a novel design utilizing the large negative transconductance in multilayer graphene , in which the mean - free paths of charge carriers are controlled by gating @xcite .",
    "in addition , the conductivity drop in multilayer graphene could be used for electronic device applications such as amplifiers , oscillators , and multivalued logic systems .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of tuning the conductivity drop by changing the interlayer separation or doping method .",
    "multilayer graphene is composed of a series of two - dimensional hexagonal lattices of carbon atoms , and its electronic and transport properties strongly depend on the stacking arrangements of each layer . in this paper , we calculate the density - dependent conductivity of multilayer graphene within the boltzmann transport theory , focusing on the high density regime at which higher subbands are occupied by charge carriers and multiple subbands are involved in the scattering process .",
    "note that boltzmann transport theory is known to be valid at the high density limit , and therefore , the multiband scattering can be described well in this semi - classical formulation .",
    "we calculate the conductivity in the presence of randomly distributed coulomb impurities and short - range scatterers in the multilayer graphene environment . in general , the screened coulomb scattering is known to be an important scattering mechanism at low densities , whereas the short - ranged scattering mechanism is believed to be important at high carrier densities @xcite . in our calculation , we incorporate the effects of multiband electronic scattering off the impurity centers , which are described by a set of coupled equations that relate the relaxation times for the multiple subbands involved in scattering .    considering the multiband scattering , the coupled boltzmann transport equations for band @xmath3 is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an applied electric field , @xmath6 is the carrier velocity in the @xmath3-th band with 2d momentum @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the distribution function of the carriers in the @xmath3-th band , and @xmath9 is the scattering probability from @xmath10 to @xmath11 . note that @xmath12 because of the detailed balance . to solve the coupled boltzmann transport equations",

    "if we consider a single - band system , only the intraband transition term @xmath31 appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq : multiband_scattering ] ) , and @xmath31 becomes @xmath32 , i.e. , the inverse of the one band momentum relaxation time @xcite .",
    "in contrast , @xmath29 represents the interband transition rate , which describes the scattering from bands @xmath3 to @xmath21 , whereas @xmath30 describes the interband transition rate from the @xmath21-th band scattered into the @xmath3-th band , as schematically shown in fig .",
    "note that @xmath33 have different cosine weight factors , which leads to a reduced or enhanced contribution depending on the scattering directions .",

    "we consider two types of scattering sources : long - range charged impurities and short - range scatterers .",
    "the charged impurities are screened by the carriers , and we treat the screened coulomb potential within the thomas - fermi approximation , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the thomas - fermi wavevector , @xmath44 is the effective background dielectric constant , @xmath45 is the total dos at the fermi energy @xmath39 ( which includes the spin and valley degeneracies as well as all the bands crossing @xmath39 ) , and @xmath46 is the average distance between the impurities and the graphene sheet .",
    "the short - range scatterers describe atomic defects or vacancies , and can be approximated as a dirac - delta function in the real space or a constant potential @xmath47 in the momentum space .",
    "when we consider both charged impurities and short - range scatterers together , we add their scattering rates according to matthiessen s rule , assuming that each scattering mechanism is independent .    using eq .",
    "( [ eq_sigma ] ) , we first qualitatively describe the conductivity behaviors of multilayer graphene when higher subbands are occupied by charge carriers",
    ". when the fermi energy reaches the higher subbands , there are three notable features in the transport properties .",
    "first , the conducting channels increase because charge carriers in the high - energy subbands participate in transport , which provides higher conductivity .",
    "second , the scattering channels are increased because of the allowed interband scatterings , which make the scattering rate increase ( or equivalently , conductivity decreases ) .",
    "third , the screening is enhanced because the dos increases because of the higher band contribution , which reduces scattering and increases conductivity for charged impurities .",
    "the net effect of the conductivity change is determined by competition among these effects @xcite .",
    "in this section , we show the calculated conductivity of multilayer graphene in terms of the carrier density . in the calculations , we used the following parameters : @xmath48 @xmath1 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 for charged impurities , and for short - range scatterers , @xmath51 ( ev@xmath52)@xmath53 . for the tight - binding parameters , we used @xmath54 ev and @xmath55 ev for the nearest - neighbor intralayer and interlayer hopping terms , respectively .    figure",
    "[ fig : conductivity ] shows the numerically calculated conductivity as a function of carrier density for ( a ) ab bilayer , ( b ) aba trilayer , ( c ) abc trilayer , and ( d ) abca tetralayer graphene .",
    "a salient feature in our results is the conductivity drop at a certain carrier density ( @xmath56 @xmath1 ) , where the second subband begins to be occupied by charge carriers .",
    "the conductivity drop is especially prominent in abc and abca stacking . in ab and aba stacking , there is no significant change in conductivity at the bottom of the second subband , which can be attributed to the cancellation between the enhancement of interband scattering and the increase in conducting channels .",
    "we find that the conductivity drop is significant for the short - range scatterers , which are the dominant scattering source at high carrier densities .",
    "thus , overall conductivity at high carrier densities follows the behavior of short - range scattering .",
    "when we consider only screened charged impurities , the conductivity shows a peak at the band touching point instead of a drop , which is mostly induced by the enhanced screening associated with the enhanced dos .    to understand these opposite behaviors at the band touching density for the two scattering sources , we consider the dos dependence of the scattering rate for each impurity .",
    "note that @xmath57 , which negatively contributes to the scattering rate , is typically much smaller than @xmath58 because of the cosine weight factor in eq .",
    "the interband transition rate for the low - energy subband at the band touching point is then governed by the contribution from the low - energy subband to the high - energy subband , which is directly proportional to the higher band dos , @xmath59 . because @xmath24 is constant for short - range scatterers , the interband scattering rate becomes @xmath60 , leading to the conductivity drop .",
    "thus , the conductivity drop is significant in the abc and abca stackings because of the divergent dos at the band touching point . for screened charged impurities ,",
    "the screening effects play a more important role in the scattering rate , and we have @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , where @xmath63 .",
    "thus , the transition rate becomes approximately inversely proportional to the dos , which decreases the overall transition rate .",
    "when the screening effect overwhelms the contribution from the interband transition in the scattering rate , the conductivity due to the charged impurities shows a peak at the band touching point . because the scattering rates for short - range scatterers are much larger than those for charged impurities at the band touching point , the overall scattering rate of multilayer graphene is mainly governed by short - range scatterers and the total conductivity exhibits a drop at the band touching density . note that at low carrier densities , the impurity scattering strongly depends on the stacking arrangements , whereas at high enough densities , multilayer graphene behaves as decoupled monolayer graphene sheets in which short - range scatterers dominate over charged impurities @xcite",
    ".     density dependence of conductivity ( top panel ) and electronic structure ( bottom panel ) for ab bilayer graphene with ( a ) uniform doping and ( b ) back gating , and for abc trilayer graphene with ( c ) uniform doping and ( d ) back gating .",
    "red lines in bottom panel represent the band touching energy level for each doping .",
    "the insets in ( a ) and ( b ) show interband wavevector overlap @xmath64 at the band touching point . ]",
    "the transport properties of the bernal ( periodic ab ) and rhombohedral ( periodic abc ) stacking arrangements are quite different because of the different electronic structures and chiral nature , even for the same number of layers , as shown in fig .  [ fig : conductivity ] . in general ,",
    "rhombohedral stacking shows a more pronounced conductivity drop near the band touching density than bernal stacking .",
    "although bernal stacking is more stable and common , rhombohedral stacking is also found in highly ordered pyrolytic graphite or natural crystal graphite at a concentration of approximately @xmath65 @xcite , and thus can be used for novel device applications , as is discussed later .    in most graphene - based field - effect transistors ,",
    "the carrier density is controlled by gate voltage and the electronic band structure is affected by the applied gate voltage .",
    "we now consider the electrically gated multilayer graphene in which charge carriers are supplied from the back gate and the layer charge is determined electrostatically under the boundary condition that the electric field above the top layer is zero .",
    "figures [ fig : external_field](a ) and ( b ) show the conductivity of ab bilayer graphene .",
    "we compare the result obtained without the band modification ( uniform doping ) with the result obtained with the gate - voltage dependent band change ( back gating ) . as shown in the insets of figs .",
    "[ fig : external_field](a ) and ( b ) , the interband overlap factor @xmath64 in back - gated ab bilayer graphene does not vanish , in contrast to the uniform doping case , which enhances the interband scattering , leading to a conductivity drop at the band touching point . in the case of abc trilayer graphene",
    ", the minimum of the second subband in the presence of the gating occurs near @xmath66 ( but not exactly at @xmath66 because of the formation of a mexican hat structure in the trilayer and beyond ) , which reduces the dos .",
    "thus , the conductivity drop becomes smaller than that of the uniform doping case , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : external_field](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "these results indicate that the doping method affects the conductivity behavior at the bottom of the second subband by changing the energy band structure and its chiral nature .     in abc stacking .",
    "blue , black and red lines represent @xmath67 ev , respectively .",
    "the inset shows the band touching density as a function of @xmath68 for abc stacking . ]    as discussed earlier , short - range scatterers are dominant over charged impurities at high carrier densities . in order to qualitatively understand the drop in conductivity ,",
    "we focus on the density dependence of conductivity in the presence of dominant short - range scatterers only .",
    "we define the drop ratio as the ratio of conductivity just below the band touching density @xmath69 to that at @xmath70 @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : interlayer_control](a ) , we show the conductivity drop ratio near the band touching point in rhombohedral stacking for uniform doping and back gating .",
    "the drop ratio increases with the number of layers because of the enhanced dos at the band touching point . note that the drop ratio for uniform doping is higher than that for back gating , which can be attributed to the occurrence of the band minima of the second subband away from @xmath66 , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : external_field](c ) and ( d ) .",
    "figure [ fig : interlayer_control](b ) shows the density dependence of conductivity for short - range scatterers for several values of the interlayer hopping @xmath71 in abc graphene .",
    "it is possible to control the band touching density by adjusting the interlayer hopping constant @xmath71 through the interlayer separation between layers .",
    "note that the interlayer hopping @xmath72 with interlayer separation @xmath73 typically decays exponentially in the form of @xmath74 , where @xmath75 @xmath76 is the interlayer separation at which @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the characteristic decay length for the hopping integral @xcite .",
    "we find that the conductivity value just before the band touching ( @xmath79 , where @xmath80 @xmath81 is the lattice constant ) and the saturation value at large carrier densities ( @xmath82 ) do not depend on the interlayer hopping in the case of uniform doping .",
    "this means that a change in the interlayer hopping does not affect the drop ratio significantly , which is also true for back gating . as shown in the inset , however , the band touching density @xmath83 strongly depends on the interlayer hopping .",
    "thus , the conductivity drop can occur at a much lower density if the interlayer separation is properly increased .",
    "we find that this trend is qualitatively true for a general rhombohedral graphene .    in summary",
    ", we studied the electronic transport properties of multilayer graphene , focusing on the effect of multiband scattering at high carrier densities where the higher subband is occupied by carriers . by directly solving the coupled boltzmann transport equations in the presence of both charged coulomb impurities and short - range scatterers",
    ", we showed that the conductivity of multilayer graphene exhibits a sudden change when charge carriers begin to occupy the higher subbands , and thus a large negative transconductance ( ntc ) appears as the carrier density varies .",
    "the large ntc arises mostly from the intersubband scattering and the change in the dos at the band touching point .",
    "we found that the conductivity drop in rhombohedral stacking is more prominent than that in bernal stacking because of divergent dos at the bottom of the higher subbands and increased interband scatterings .",
    "we also showed that the conductivity drop is affected by the doping method and interlayer separation , and an efficient conductivity drop can be obtained for uniformly doped rhombohedral graphene . based on our results",
    ", it may be possible to design novel devices utilizing the large ntc in multilayer graphene in which the mean - free paths of the charge carriers are controlled by gating .",
    "in addition , the conductivity drop in multilayer graphene could be used for electronic device applications such as amplifiers , oscillators , and multivalued logic systems . for better device applications ,",
