    "prestellar cores are cores that are either on the verge of collapse or already collapsing ( e.g. myers & benson 1983 , ward - thompson et al . 2002 ) .",
    "they represent the initial stage of star formation and their study is important since theoretical models of star formation are very sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "prestellar cores have been observed either isolated or embedded in protoclusters .",
    "isolated prestellar cores ( e.g. l1544 , l43 , l63 ) have extent @xmath4 au and masses @xmath5 ( ward - thompson et al",
    ". 1999 , andr et al . 2000 ) . on the other hand , prestellar cores embedded in protoclusters",
    "( e.g. in @xmath6 oph , ngc2068/2071 ) are generally smaller , with extent @xmath7 au and masses @xmath8 ( motte et al .",
    "1998 , motte et al . 2001 ) .    in this paper , we present radiative transfer models of non - embedded and embedded prestellar cores , performed using a 3-d monte carlo radiative transfer code we have developed ( phaethon ) .",
    "our method ( stamatellos & whitworth 2003 ) is similar to that developed by wolf , henning & stecklum ( 1999 ) and bjorkman & wood ( 2001 ) .",
    "we represent the radiation field of a source ( star or background radiation ) by a large number of monochromatic luminosity packets ( @xmath9-packets ) .",
    "these @xmath9-packets are injected into the system and interact stochastically with it .",
    "if an @xmath9-packet is absorbed its energy is added to the local cell and raises the local temperature . to ensure radiative equilibrium",
    "the @xmath9-packet is re - emitted immediately with a new frequency chosen from the difference between the local cell emissivity before and after the absorption of the packet ( bjorkman & wood 2001 ) .",
    "this method conserves energy exactly , accounts for the diffuse radiation field and its 3-dimensional nature makes it attractive for application in a variety of systems .",
    "the code has been thoroughly tested using the thermodynamic equilibrium test ( stamatellos & whitworth 2003 ) and also against benchmark ( ivezic et al .",
    "1997 ) and previous ( bjorkman & wood 2001 ) calculations .",
    "we represent prestellar cores by bonnor - ebert ( be ) spheres , in which gravity is balanced by gas pressure ( bonnor 1956 , ebert 1955 ) . in many cases",
    "this is a good approximation to prestellar cores ( e.g. alves et al .",
    "2001 , ward - thompson et al .",
    "2002 ) .    for the radiation incident on the core",
    ", we use the black ( 1994 ) interstellar radiation field ( hereafter bisrf ) , that consists of an optical component due to radiation from giant stars and dwarfs , a component due to thermal emission from dust grains , mid - infrared radiation from non - thermally heated grains and the cosmic background radiation .",
    "the opacity of the dust at the low temperatures ( 5 - 20k ) and high densities ( @xmath10 @xmath11 ) expected in prestellar cores , is quite uncertain . in our study",
    ", we use the opacities calculated by ossenkopf and henning ( 1994 ) , for grains that have coagulated and accreted thin ice mantles .",
    "we find that the temperature inside non - embedded cores drops from around 17 k , at the edge of the core , to a minimum at the centre , which maybe as low as 7 k , depending on the visual extinction to the centre of the core .",
    "our results are similar to those of previous studies ( evans et al .",
    "2001 , zucconi et al .",
    "the radiation field incident on cores embedded in molecular clouds is different from that incident on isolated non - embedded cores .",
    "the ambient molecular cloud absorbs the uv , optical and nir part of the radiation and reemits it in the fir and submm region ( mathis et al .",
    "it also makes the radiation incident on the core anisotropic , because , in general , the ambient cloud is not homogeneous .",
    "another factor that contributes to the anisotropy of the radiation incident on an embedded core is the presence of stars or protostars in the vicinity of the core or the cloud ( e.g as in @xmath6 oph ; liseau et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "[ [ the - model ] ] the model + + + + + + + + +    in this first approach ( stamatellos & whitworth 2003 ) , we study a spherical core at the centre of a molecular cloud of uniform density .",
    "the radiation incident on the molecular cloud is the bisrf , but the radiation incident on the core is enhanced in the fir and submm and reduced at shorter wavelengths , as a result of the presence of the molecular cloud around the core .",
    "we chose the parameters of our models so as to mimic the embedded prestellar cores and the conditions in the @xmath6 oph protocluster ( see motte et al .",
    "1998 ) : core sizes @xmath12 au , masses @xmath13 , ambient cloud particle density @xmath14 and ambient cloud pressure @xmath15@xmath11  k. in figs .",
    "[ fig_oem2a]-[fig_oem2b ] , we present our calculations for a supercritical core at gas temperature @xmath16=15  k with mass 0.8 m@xmath17 , under external pressure @xmath18  k , surrounded by a spherical ambient cloud with different visual optical depths .

    "[ fig_oem2a ] , dashed lines ) , the temperature drops from @xmath2016  k at the edge of the core to around 6 - 7  k in the centre ( @xmath21  k , depending on the core density ) , whereas with a @xmath22 ambient cloud ( fig .",
    "[ fig_oem2a ] , dotted lines ) the temperature drops from around 11  k to 7  k ( @xmath23  k ) .",
    "our studies show that dust temperatures inside embedded cores are probably lower than 12  k in cores surrounded by even a relatively thin cloud ( @xmath24 ) , which seems to be the case for many of the prestellar cores in @xmath6 ophiuchi .",
    "previous studies ( motte et al . 1998 , johnstone et al . 2000 ) of cores in this region , assumed isothermal dust at temperatures from 12 to 20  k , when calculating core masses from mm observations and , thus , they may have underestimated masses by a factor of 2 .",
    "recent studies ( andr et al . 2003 , andr , this volume ) find similar temperature profiles , using a different approach , in which they estimate the effective radiation field incident on an embedded core from observations .",

    "[ fig_oem2b]a ) , and the intensity increases towards the edge of the core . for very centrally - condensed cores the decrease towards the centre is just @xmath25 mjy@xmath3 , but for less centrally - condensed cores it is even lower .",
    "thus , very sensitive ( say @xmath26 mjy@xmath3 ) observations are needed to detect cores in absorption at 90  @xmath1 .            at wavelengths near the peak of the core emission ( 150 - 250  @xmath1 )",
    "the intensity increases by a small amount ( @xmath27 mjy@xmath3 above the background ) towards the edge of the core ( fig .",
    "[ fig_oem2b]b ) . the higher the increase in the intensity near the core boundary ,",
    "the less embedded is the core .",
    "thus , very sensitive observations of embedded prestellar cores at 170 - 200  @xmath1 , might allow us to determine the extinction of the cloud surrounding the core , and , thus , to estimate roughly the position of the core inside the cloud . however , more sophisticated modelling is required , with an accurate density profile for the cloud and taking into account the close environment of the core under study .    finally , at submillimeter and millimetre wavelengths ( 400 - 1300  @xmath1 ) the intensity drops toward the edge of the core considerably ( fig .  [ fig_oem2b]c ) .",

    "the deeper the core is embedded the less distinct from the background is .",
    "the lower value corresponds to a subcritical core and the higher value to a supercritical ( i.e. more centrally condensed ) core .",
    "@xmath33 at 90  @xmath1 the core seen in absorption against the background .",
    "[ tab : diagnostics ]    the peak emission from embedded cores could be as low as @xmath20 10 mjy@xmath3 above the background at 1300  @xmath1 , but it s at least @xmath20 40 mjy@xmath3 at 450  @xmath1 . the wavelength range between 400 - 500 seems favourable for observing embedded cores but the atmospheric transmission is not good in this range and space observations are needed .",

    "as expected , the ` equator ' of the core is colder than the ` poles ' .",

    "[ [ seds - and - images ] ] seds and images + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the sed distribution ( fig .  [ asym.cores ] , right ) of the core is the same at any viewing angle , because the core is optically thin to the radiation it emits ( fir and longer wavelengths ) .",

    "@xmath1 the outer , hotter parts of the core dominate the core emission .",
    "the core appears spherical when viewed pole - on and elongated when viewed edge - on .",
    "the image at 30@xmath48 is quite interesting , with two absorption ` blobs ' near the centre of the core .",
    "a quick search through the kirk ( 2003 ) sample of iso / isophot observations did not reveal cores with such distinctive features , which is surprising , because one excepts some of the observed cores to be viewed at such angles .",
    "further study is required to see whether this is due to the sensitivity and resolution of observations , due to selection effects , or it is connected with the core structure and its environment ( i.e. the ambient cloud ) .    at longer wavelengths , like 850  @xmath1 , the core emission is regulated by the column density .",
    "thus , when the core is viewed edge - on the intensity is larger at the centre .",
    "for the same reason the core looks elongated when the observer is looking at it at any other direction than pole - on .",
    "we applied a monte carlo radiative transfer method to spherical cores embedded inside molecular clouds .",
    "we find that the temperature inside these cores is less than 12 k , even for an ambient cloud with moderate visual extinction @xmath49 .",
    "we also studied asymmetric non - embedded cores and the preliminary results show that a small disk - like asymmetry in the density distribution will make the core look elongated when viewed at a random angle ."
