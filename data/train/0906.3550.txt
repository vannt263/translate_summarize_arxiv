    "how can one engineer conditions under which a desired structure will spontaneously self - assemble from simpler components ?",
    "this inverse problem arises naturally in many fields , such as chemistry , materials science , biotechnology , or nanotechnology ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite and the references cited therein ) .",
    "a full solution remains distant , but in this paper we develop connections with coding and information theory , and we apply these connections to give a detailed mathematical analysis of several fundamental cases .",
    "our work is inspired by a series of papers by rechtsman , stillinger , and torquato , in which they design potential functions that can produce a honeycomb @xcite , square @xcite , cubic @xcite , or diamond @xcite lattice . in this paper , we analyze finite analogues of these structures , and we show similar results for much simpler classes of potential functions .    for an initial example , suppose @xmath0 identical point particles are confined to the surface of a unit sphere ( in the spirit of the thomson problem of how classical electrons arrange themselves on a spherical shell ) .",
    "we wish them to form a regular dodecahedron with @xmath1 pentagonal facets .",
    "suppose the only flexibility we have in designing the system is that we can specify an isotropic pair potential @xmath2 between the points .",
    "in other words , the potential energy @xmath3 of a configuration ( i.e. , set of points ) @xmath4 is @xmath5 in static equilibrium , the point configuration will assume a form that at least locally minimizes @xmath3 . can we arrange for the energy - minimizing configuration to be a dodecahedron ?",
    "furthermore , can we arrange for it to have a large basin of attraction under natural processes such as gradient descent ?",
    "if so , then we can truly say that the dodecahedron automatically self - assembles out of randomly arranged points when the proper potential function is imposed .",
    "if we could choose @xmath2 arbitrarily , then it would certainly be possible to make the dodecahedron the global minimum for energy by using potential wells , as in the blue graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : potwellsconvex ] . by contrast , this can not be done with familiar potential functions , such as inverse power laws , because the dodecahedron s pentagonal facets are highly unstable and prone to collapse into a triangulation .",
    "unfortunately , the potential function shown in the blue graph in fig .  [ fig : potwellsconvex ] is quite elaborate .",
    "actually implementing precisely specified potential wells in a physical system would be an enormous challenge .",
    "instead , one might ask for a simpler potential function , for example one that is decreasing and convex ( corresponding to a repulsive , decaying force ) .    .",
    "only the front half of the sphere is shown . ]    in fact , @xmath2 can be chosen to be both decreasing and convex . the green graph in fig .",
    "[ fig : potwellsconvex ] shows such a potential function , which is described and analyzed in theorem  [ theorem : dodecahedron ] .",
    "we prove that the regular dodecahedron is the unique ground state for this system .",
    "we have been unable to prove anything about the basin of attraction , but computer simulations indicate that it is large ( we performed @xmath6 independent trials using random starting configurations , and all but @xmath7 converged to the dodecahedron ) .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : dodec - top ] shows the paths of the particles in a typical case , with the passage of time indicated by the transition from yellow to red .",
    "our approach to this problem makes extensive use of linear programming .",
    "this enables us to give a probabilistic algorithm for inverse statistical mechanics . using it",
    ", we construct simple potential functions with counterintuitive ground states .",
    "these states are analogues of those studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , but we use much simpler potential functions . finally , we make use of the linear programming bounds from coding theory to give rigorous mathematical proofs for some of our assertions .",
    "these bounds allow us to prove that the desired configurations are the true ground states of our potential functions .",
    "by contrast , previous results in this area were purely experimental and could not be rigorously analyzed .",
    "to arrive at a tractable problem , we make four fundamental assumptions .",
    "first , we will deal with only finitely many particles confined to a bounded region of space .",
    "this is not an important restriction in itself , because periodic boundary conditions could create an effectively infinite number of particles .",
    "second , we will use classical physics , rather than quantum mechanics .",
    "our ideas are not intrinsically classical , but computational necessity forces our hand .",
    "quantum systems are difficult to simulate classically ( otherwise the field of quantum computing would not exist ) , and there is little point in attempting to design systems computationally when we can not even simulate them . fortunately ,",
    "classical approximations are often of real - world as well as theoretical value .",
    "for example , they are excellent models for soft matter systems such as polymers and colloids @xcite .",
    "third , we restrict our attention to a limited class of potential functions , namely isotropic pair potentials .",
    "these potentials depend only on the pairwise distances between the particles , with no directionality and no three - particle interactions ; they are the simplest potential functions worthy of analysis .",
    "for example , the classical electric potential is of this sort .",
    "we expect that our methods will prove useful in more complex cases , but isotropic pair potentials have received the most attention in the literature and already present many challenges .    finally , we assume all the particles are identical",
    ". this assumption plays no algorithmic role and is made purely for the sake of convenience .",
    "the prettiest structures are often the most symmetrical , and using identical particles facilitates such symmetry",
    ".    we must still specify the ambient space for the particles .",
    "three choices are particularly natural : we could study finite clusters of particles in euclidean space , configurations in a flat torus ( i.e. , a region in space with periodic boundary conditions , so the number of particles is effectively infinite ) , or configurations on a sphere .",
    "our algorithms apply to all three cases , but in this paper we will focus on spherical configurations .",
    "they are in many ways the most symmetrical case , and they are commonly analyzed , for example in thomson s problem of arranging classical electrons on a sphere .",
    "thus , we will use the following model .",
    "suppose we have @xmath8 identical point particles confined to the surface of the unit sphere @xmath9 in @xmath10-dimensional euclidean space @xmath11 .",
    "( we choose to work in units in which the radius is @xmath12 , but of course any other radius can be achieved by a simple rescaling . )",
    "we use a potential function @xmath13 \\to { { \\mathbb r}}$ ] , for which we define the energy of a configuration @xmath14 as in eq .  .",
    "we define @xmath2 only on @xmath15 $ ] because no other distances occur between distinct points on the unit sphere .",
    "note that we have formulated the problem in an arbitrary number @xmath10 of dimensions .",
    "it might seem that @xmath16 would be the most relevant for the real world , but @xmath17 is also a contender , because the surface of the unit sphere in @xmath18 is itself a three - dimensional manifold ( merely embedded in four dimensions ) .",
    "we can think of @xmath19 as an idealized model of a curved three - dimensional space .",
    "this curvature is important for the problem of `` geometrical frustration '' @xcite : many beautiful local configurations of particles do not extend to global configurations , but once the ambient space is given a small amount of curvature they piece together cleanly . as the curvature tends to zero ( equivalently , as the radius of the sphere or the number of particles tends to infinity )",
    ", we recover the euclidean behavior .",
    "although this may sound like an abstract trick , it sometimes provides a strikingly appropriate model for a real - world phenomenon ; see , for example , figure  2.6 in ref .",
    "@xcite , which compares the radial distribution function obtained by x - ray diffraction on amorphous iron to that from a regular polytope in @xmath19 and finds an excellent match between the peaks .",
    "the case of the ordinary sphere @xmath20 in @xmath21 is also more closely connected to actual applications that it might at first appear .",
    "one scenario is a pickering emulsion , in which colloidal particles adsorb onto small droplets in the emulsion .",
    "the particles are essentially confined to the surface of the sphere and can interact with each other , for example , via a screened coulomb potential or by more elaborate potentials .",
    "this approach has in fact been used in practice to fabricate colloidosomes @xcite .",
    "see also the review article @xcite , in particular section  1.2 , and the references cited therein for more examples of physics on curved , two - dimensional surfaces , such as amphiphilic membranes or viral capsids .      from the static perspective , we wish to understand what the ground state is ( i.e. , which configuration minimizes energy ) and what other local minima exist . from the dynamic perspective",
    ", we wish to understand the movement of particles and the basins of attraction of the local minima for energy .",
    "there are several fundamental questions :    1 .   given a configuration @xmath4 , can one choose an isotropic pair potential @xmath2 under which @xmath4 is the unique ground state for @xmath22 points ?",
    "how simple can @xmath2 be ?",
    "can it be decreasing ?",
    "convex ? 3 .",
    "how large can the basin of attraction be made ?    in this paper , we give a complete answer to the first question , giving necessary and sufficient conditions for such a potential to exist .",
    "the second question is more subtle , but we rigorously answer it for several important cases . in particular , we show that one can often use remarkably simple potential functions .",
    "the third question is the most subtle of all , and there is little hope of providing rigorous proofs ; instead , experimental evidence must suffice .",
    "the second question is particularly relevant for experimental work , for example with colloids , because only a limited range of potentials can be manipulated in the lab .",
    "inverse statistical mechanics with simple potential functions was therefore raised as a challenge for future work in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will focus on four especially noteworthy structures :    1 .",
    "the @xmath23 vertices of a cube , with @xmath7 square facets .",
    "the @xmath0 vertices of a regular dodecahedron , with @xmath1 pentagonal facets .",
    "3 .   the @xmath24 vertices of a hypercube in four dimensions , with @xmath23 cubic facets ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : hypercube ] ) .",
    "the @xmath25 vertices of a regular @xmath26-cell in four dimensions , with @xmath26 dodecahedral facets ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:120cell ] ) .",
    "the latter two configurations exist in four dimensions , but as discussed above the sphere containing them is a three - dimensional space , so they are intrinsically three - dimensional .",
    "-cell ( with a dodecahedral facet in red ) . ]",
    "these configurations are important test cases , because they are elegant and symmetrical yet at the same time not at all easy to build .",
    "the problem is that their facets are too large , which makes them highly unstable . under ordinary potential functions , such as inverse power laws",
    ", these configurations are never even local minima , let alone global minima . in the case of the cube ,",
    "one can typically improve it by rotating two opposite facets so they are no longer aligned .",
    "that lowers the energy , and indeed the global minimum appears to be the antiprism arrived at via a @xmath27 rotation ( and subsequent adjustment of the edge lengths ) .",
    "it might appear that this process always works , and that the cube can never minimize a convex , decreasing potential function .",
    "however , careful calculation shows that this argument is mistaken , and we will exhibit an explicit convex , decreasing potential function for which the cube is provably the unique global minimum .",
    "one reason why the four configurations mentioned above are interesting is that they are spherical analogues of the honeycomb and diamond packings from @xmath28 and @xmath21 , respectively . in each of our four cases , the nearest neighbors of any point form the vertices of a regular spherical simplex .",
    "they have the smallest possible coordination numbers that can occur in locally jammed packings ( see , for example , ref .",
    "suppose @xmath4 is a configuration in @xmath29 . the obvious way to build @xmath4 is to use deep potential wells ( i.e. , local minima in @xmath2 ) corresponding to the distances between points in @xmath4 , so that configurations that use only those distances are energetically favored .",
    "this method produces complicated potential functions , which may be difficult to produce in the real world , but it is systematic and straightforward . in this section",
    "we rigorously analyze the limitations of this method and determine exactly when it works , thereby answering a question raised towards the end of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the first limitation is obvious .",
    "define the _ distance distribution _ of @xmath4 to be the function @xmath30 such that @xmath31 is the number of pairs of points in @xmath4 at distance @xmath32 .",
    "the distance distribution determines the potential energy via @xmath33 thus , @xmath4 can not possibly be the unique ground state unless it is the only configuration with its distance distribution .",
    "the second limitation is more subtle .",
    "the formula   shows that @xmath34 depends linearly on @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath30 is a weighted average of the distance distributions of some other configurations , then the energy of @xmath4 will be the same weighted average of the other configurations energies . in that case",
    ", one of those configurations must have energy at least as low as that of @xmath4 .",
    "call @xmath30 _ extremal _ if it is an extreme point of the convex hull of the space of all distance distributions of @xmath22-point configurations in @xmath29 ( i.e. , it can not be written as a weighted average of other distance distributions ) .",
    "if @xmath4 is the unique ground state for some isotropic pair potential , then @xmath30 must be extremal .",
    "for an example , consider three - point configurations on the circle @xmath35 , specified by the angles between the points ( the shorter way around the circle ) .",
    "the distance distribution of the configuration with angles @xmath27 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is not extremal , because it is the average of those for the @xmath27 , @xmath27 , @xmath36 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath37 configurations .",
    "[ theorem : potwells ] if @xmath4 is the unique configuration in @xmath29 with its distance distribution @xmath30 and @xmath30 is extremal , then there exists a smooth potential function @xmath13 \\to { { \\mathbb r}}$ ] under which @xmath4 is the unique ground state among configurations of @xmath22 points in @xmath29 .",
    "the analogue of theorem  [ theorem : potwells ] for finite clusters of particles in euclidean space is also true , with almost exactly the same proof .",
    "_ proof : _ because @xmath30 is extremal , there exists a function @xmath38 defined on the support @xmath39 of @xmath30 [ i.e. , the set of all @xmath32 such that @xmath40 such that @xmath30 is the unique minimum of @xmath41 among @xmath22-point distance distributions @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "such a function corresponds to a supporting hyperplane for the convex hull of the distance distributions with support contained in @xmath39 .    for each @xmath44",

    "however , consider what happens to the ground states under @xmath45 as @xmath50 tends to @xmath56 .",
    "all subsequential limits of their distance distributions must be distance distributions with support in @xmath39 .",
    "because of the choice of @xmath38 , the only possibility is that they are all @xmath30 . in other words ,",
    "as @xmath50 tends to @xmath56 the distance distributions of all ground states must approach @xmath30 . because the number of points at each given distance is an integer",
    ", it follows that when @xmath50 is sufficiently small , for each @xmath52 , there are exactly @xmath31 distances in each ground state that are within @xmath50 of @xmath32 . because @xmath45 has a strict local minimum at each point in @xmath39 , it follows that it is minimized at @xmath30 ( and only at @xmath30 ) when @xmath50 is sufficiently small .",
    "the conclusion of the theorem then follows from our assumption that @xmath4 is the unique configuration in @xmath29 with distance distribution @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath57    it would be interesting to have a version of theorem  [ theorem : potwells ] for infinite collections of particles in euclidean space , but there are technical obstacles .",
    "having infinitely many distances between particles makes the analysis more complicated , and one particular difficulty is what happens if the set of distances has an accumulation point or is even dense ( for example in the case of a disordered packing ) .",
    "in such a case there seems to be no simple way to use potential wells , but in fact a continuous function with a fractal structure can have a dense set of strict local minima , and perhaps it could in theory serve as a potential function .",
    "in this section we describe an algorithm for optimizing the potential function to create a specified ground state .",
    "our algorithm is similar to , and inspired by , the zero - temperature optimization procedure introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the key difference is that their algorithm is based on a fixed list of competing configurations and uses simulated annealing , whereas ours dynamically updates that list and uses linear programming .",
    "( we also omit certain conditions on the phonon spectrum that ensure mechanical stability . in our algorithm",
    ", they appear to be implied automatically once the list of competitors is sufficiently large . )",
    "suppose the allowed potential functions are the linear combinations of a finite set @xmath58 of specified functions .",
    "in practice , this may model a situation in which only certain potential functions are physically realizable , with relative strengths that can be adjusted within a specified range , while in theory we may choose the basic potential functions so that their linear combinations can approximate any reasonable function arbitrarily closely as @xmath59 becomes large .    given a configuration @xmath14 ,",
    "we wish to choose a linear combination @xmath60 so that @xmath4 is the global minimum for @xmath34 .",
    "we may also wish to impose other conditions on @xmath2 , such as monotonicity or convexity .",
    "we assume that all additional conditions are given by finitely many linear inequalities in the coefficients @xmath61 .",
    "( for conditions such as monotonicity or convexity , which apply over the entire interval @xmath15 $ ] of distances , we approximate them by imposing these conditions on a large but finite subset of the interval . )    given a finite set of competitors @xmath62 to @xmath4 , we can choose the coefficients by solving a linear program .",
    "specifically , we add an additional variable @xmath63 and impose the constraints @xmath64 for @xmath65 , in addition to any additional constraints ( as in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "we then choose @xmath61 and @xmath63 so as to maximize @xmath63 subject to these constraints . because this maximization problem is a linear program ,",
    "its solution is easily found .",
    "if the coefficients can be chosen so that @xmath4 is the global minimum , then @xmath63 will be positive and this procedure will produce a potential function for which @xmath4 has energy less than each of @xmath62 .",
    "the difficulty is how to choose these competitors . in some cases , it is easy to guess the best choices : for example , the natural competitors to a cube are the square antiprisms . in others , it is far from easy .",
    "which configurations compete with the regular @xmath26-cell in @xmath19 ?",
    "our simulation - guided algorithm iteratively builds a list of competitors and an improved potential function .",
    "we start with any choice of coefficients , say @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and the empty list of competitors .",
    "we then choose @xmath22 random points on @xmath29 and minimize energy by gradient descent to produce a competitor to @xmath4 , which we add to the list ( if it is different from @xmath4 ) and use to update the choice of coefficients .",
    "this alternation between gradient descent and linear programming continues until either we are satisfied that @xmath4 is the global minimum of the potential function , or we find a list of competitors for which linear programming shows that @xmath63 must be negative ( in which case no choice of coefficients makes @xmath4 the ground state ) .",
    "this procedure is only a heuristic algorithm .",
    "when @xmath63 is negative , it proves that @xmath4 can not be the ground state ( using linear combinations of @xmath58 satisfying the desired constraints ) , but otherwise nothing is proved . as the number of iterations grows large ,",
    "the algorithm is almost certain to make @xmath4 the ground state if that is possible , because eventually all possible competitors will be located .",
    "however , we have no bounds on the rate at which this occurs .",
    "we hope that @xmath4 will not only be the ground state , but will also have a large basin of attraction under gradient descent . maximizing",
    "the energy difference @xmath63 seems to be a reasonable approach , but other criteria may do even better . in practice , simulation - guided optimization does not always produce a large basin of attraction , even when one is theoretically possible . sometimes it helps to remove the first handful of competitors from the list once the algorithm has progressed far enough .",
    "the numerical method described in the previous section appears to work well , but it is not supported by rigorous proofs . in this section we provide such proofs in several important cases .",
    "the key observation is that the conditions for proving a sharp bound in proposition  [ prop : yudin ] below are themselves linear and can be added as constraints in the simulation - guided optimization .",
    "while this does not always lead to a solution , when it does the solution is provably optimal ( and in fact no simulations are then needed ) .",
