    "in recent years , many kinds of human - carried mobile devices , such as smartphones and tablets , that enable many high - tech sensors and wireless communications have been increasingly pervasive throughout the world .",
    "because most of the people in the world usually carry these devices in their lives , their activity logs , such as places where they visit and persons who they are connected with , can be easily recorded using gps , cellphone call , and geotagging .",
    "we are living in the era of big data : by analyzing collections of data on people s activity , big companies can take advantage of success in their businesses .",
    "also , academic researchers can investigate human activities and social behaviours in more details than ever .",
    "for example , some recent studies based on the analysis of big data of human mobility patterns have revealed that human behavior is easily predictable because human mobility is biased in general @xcite .",
    "this result shows that human mobility is far from random , but is ordered .    in parallel with the understanding of human mobility patterns ,",
    "recently , many researchers become actively engaged in studies on mobility models , and many mobility models have been proposed @xcite .",
    "traditional mobility models , such as random walk ( rw ) , ( truncated ) lvy walk ( lw ) , random waypoint ( rwp ) , are simple and basic : they can easily be used for numerical simulations in general purposes , but they are far from real human mobility patterns .",
    "therefore , newly proposed models have become more realistic and complicated : they includes more parameters to explain many statistical properties on human mobility patterns and social effects , thus they resultingly consume more memory space as simulation time progresses , such as slaw @xcite .",
    "the more a model explains , however , the harder it gets to use for the simulations with a large number of walkers in general .",
    "these mobility models are often used for evaluating performance of routing protocols in delay tolerant networks ( dtns ) @xcite and mobile opportunistic networks ( mon ) @xcite . to evaluate the performance in systems with a large number of mobile nodes , we need to select a balanced mobility model properly . because the above routing protocols are often contact - based ones , the model does nt necessarily preserve real mobility patterns , but it must have real contact patterns . in the context of information communication networks , many researchers frequently mention statistical properties on inter - contact time ( or inter - meeting time ) to select the model .",
    "but , we would argue in this paper that statistical properties on _ contact frequency _ is also an important factor to properly select the mobility model .    by the way ,",
    "there is a famous japanese proverb closely related with the frequency of human contacts which is called _ ichi - go ichi - e_. this proverb is literally translated as `` one chance in a lifetime '' or more specifically as `` treasure every encounter , for it will never recur . ''",
    "this phrase is closely associated with the history of the tea ceremony of japan . _",
    "sen no riky _ ( 1522 - 1591 )",
    ", the famous tea master during the age of the provincial wars , originally taught this proverb to his pupils in the spirit of good service .",
    "later , at the end of the edo period , _ ii naosuke _ ( 1815 - 1860 ) , an accomplished practitioner of the japanese tea ceremony , rediscovered and reconsidered this lesson as it is known today .",
    "we know from experience that to meet with someone ( or something ) is sometimes very precious , and we might wonder about how often we have once - in - a - lifetime meetings in our daily lives or whether there is any statistical law that governs our meetings with people ( or things ) . to the best of our knowledge , no scientific study has answered these questions because of the difficulty of collecting long - term data concerning human contact .",
    "however , given the recent advances in mobile wireless communication technologies , studies on the statistical physics of serendipitous human encounters can now be undertaken .",
    "our research group collected data concerning daily human contact using bluetooth and wi - fi wireless communication technologies .",
    "today , billions of electronic devices equipped with bluetooth and wi - fi are used throughout the world .",
    "most of these devices are light and mobile , including mobile pcs and phones , pdas , tablets , and portable game machines .",
    "therefore , they tend to be carried at almost all times .",
    "in addition , the communication range of bluetooth and wi - fi is usually on the order of several meters , which is nearly the same as the range that humans can see when observing those around them .",
    "thus , by scanning and logging nearby bluetooth and wi - fi devices , we can collect reasonably well - sampled data concerning human encounters . in this case , here , _ encounter _ should be defined as a state that other humans having the device happen to come close within several dozen of meters at a maximum distance of its communicable range . in our experiment , we used pdas and smartphones to continuously scan once every twenty seconds and to record pairs of time stamps and mac addresses of detected devices , which indicated when a participant of the experiment encountered other people .",
    "a sample data logging software that our group uses is available as an open - access application for android os @xcite . to calculate the contact frequency , we need to give a threshold value @xmath0 where two consecutive device detections whose interval time is less than the threshold value are within the same encounter . in this research , we give @xmath1 $ ] as a choice , but we also have checked that varying the choice of the threshold from some minutes to some hours is not sensitive for the whole contact frequency . after conducting our experiment , we obtained _ long data _",
    "( rather than a recent buzzword _ big data _ )",
    "whose experimental period is between a minimum of several months and a maximum of more than two years .",
    "( see table [ table : bt_k_val - ichigoichie_ratio ] and [ table : wifi_k_val - ichigoichie_ratio ] ) . a dozen of people ( university teachers , students , and company workers ) participated and in total more than 50,000 different devices are detected in the experiment .    in this paper , by analyzing the collected experimental data",
    ", we exhibit two basic statistical properties of human contact frequency in the long data of human serendipitous encounters : ( 1 ) the property of ichi - go ichi - e , under which most human encounters occur once - in - a - experimental - period , and ( 2 ) the scale - free property of the remaining more frequent meetings",
    ". we can find that these properties clearly emerge for each individual when analyzing the long data .",
    "inversely , it is difficult to observe these properties by analyzing short - term data even if they are categorized into the big data .",
    "to theoretically explain the origin of these statistical properties observed in the experiment , we furthermore propose `` homesick lvy walk '' as a simple mobility model .",
    "this is a minimal stochastic model of human mobility that traces whether the walker stochastically selects moving long distances as well as the lvy walk @xcite , or returning back home as a minimum social effect . in order to validate the mobility model ,",
    "we offer a theoretical explanation for the properties of human contact using numerical simulations and a simple mean - field theory , which is the main contribution of the paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : experiment ] , we show the experimental results of analyzing collected data with bluetooth and wi - fi opportunistic communications . in section  [ sec : hlw ] , we propose a minimal stochastic model of human mobility patterns as a way to simultaneously explain both the two basic statistical properties . in section",
    "[ sec : simulation ] , we perform numerical simulations to show that the minimal model can explain these properties .",
    "section  [ sec : mft ] demonstrates a simple mean - field theory to explain the emergence of these properties .",
    "we summarize our work , discuss future directions , and comment on an application of the model to performance evaluation of routing protocols in delay tolerant networks in sections  [ sec : conclusion ] and [ sec : discussions ] .",
    "first , we define @xmath2 as the ratio of one - time meetings to all meetings until time @xmath3 .",
    "the ratio of ichi - go ichi - e ( once - in - a - lifetime meetings ) to all encounters can also be denoted as @xmath2 at @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the end of life . some typical time variations in @xmath2 during the experiment are shown in fig .",

    "therefore , we may roughly assume that each of the time variations in @xmath2 converges to some fixed point around the ratio @xmath7 .",
    "under this assumption , we may consider the time - averaged ratio over the experimental period denoted as @xmath6 to be approximately equivalent to the ratio @xmath7 .",
    "we present the time - averaged ratio using bluetooth , @xmath8 , and wi - fi , @xmath9 , in tables [ table : bt_k_val - ichigoichie_ratio ] and [ table : wifi_k_val - ichigoichie_ratio ] , respectively .",
    "averaged over all participants , the percentages of ichi - go ichi - e meetings using bluetooth and wi - fi are approximately 80 - 90% , meaning that the majority of human encounters occur once - in - an - experimental - period .",
    "we also considered the complementary cumulative distribution function ( ccdf ) for human contact frequency .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : contact_frequency_dist ] , the ccdf clearly follows a power - law distribution , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a scaling exponent .",
    "note that this power law is satisfied only for the remaining 10 - 20% of encounters , those that occur more than once for each individual .",

    "exponents are lower than two . because of this",
    ", the variance of the ccdf tends to diverge during a long experimental period .",
    "this divergence indicates that the number of encounters that the participants meet with people in their experimental periods has no characteristic scale . in other words ,",
    "meetings inherently exhibit extreme inequality , making it difficult to predict how many opportunities are left to encounter someone ( or something ) .",
    "next , we propose a minimal stochastic model of human mobility patterns as a way to simultaneously explain both the ichi - go ichi - e and scale - free properties of human encounters . a number of researchers have recently reported that human mobility traces statistically exhibit the lvy walk ( lw ) @xcite .",
    "a lvy walker in @xmath19-dimensional space determines his or her destination ; the travel distance from the present location @xmath20 is governed by an independently and identically distributed power - law distribution , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the lvy index . the direction from the present location to the next destination location",
    "is usually determined by the uniform distribution .",
    "this feature has been found to be common to the mobility of humans and animals in two - dimensional space @xcite .    however , the scale - free property of walk lengths is insufficient to explain the statistical properties of human contact frequency .",
    "we numerically confirmed that the ccdf of contact frequency for lvy walkers in bounded two - dimensional space generally decays exponentially at the tail .",
    "let us consider what is lacking in the ordinary lvy walk scenario .",
    "a lvy walker easily travels long distances , but has difficulty returning to his or her original position ( refer to fig .",
    "[ fig : lw_vs_hlw ] ) . in real life , however , each participant typically frequents his or her own hub of social activity ( or his or her own home ) .",
    "this reality strongly determines most of the topology of human mobility traces . taking into consideration the role of the hub , we propose an extended version of the lvy walk named the `` homesick lvy walk ( hlw ) . '' in this model , after arriving at the destination determined by the power - law walk length in eq .",
    "( [ eq : levy_walk ] ) , there exists a certain fixed probability @xmath23 that the lvy walker will become _ homesick _ and return home ; otherwise , according to probability @xmath24 , the walker will determine his or her next destination using eq .",

    "walk _ but not _",
    "flight_. in general , _ walk _ means that a walker moves with a finite velocity to the destination , but _ flight _ means that a walker jump instantly to the destination , which is the difference between these words .",
    "because we also consider serendipitous encounters on the way to the destination , we introduce homesick lvy _ walk _ here .",

    "this further validates the principle of ichi - go ichi - e , which teaches us to `` treasure every encounter . ''",
    "to facilitate a fundamental theoretical understanding of these principles , we introduced a novel stochastic model of human mobility traces called the `` homesick lvy walk . ''",
    "we used numerical simulations to demonstrate that this model can successfully explain both of the principles . furthermore , using simple mean - field theory , we determined that the origin of the principles arises from the following two opposing mechanisms that inherently underlie human mobility patterns :    1 .",

    "homesickness ( @xmath50 in hlw )    although we have proposed this model in @xcite for evaluation our proposed routing method , the origin of the above properties is first explained in this paper .",
    "balancing the two mechanisms leads the statistical principles of human contact frequency to emerge .",
    "note that according to violating the first mechanism , `` homesick random walk ( hrw ) '' whose walk length to the next destination is determined by a distribution with a finite variance does not have the scale - free property of contact frequency , which we have also checked numerically .",
    "it should be noted that we have introduced _ home _ as a minimum social effect .",
    "because homesick lvy walkers periodically return to their home , they tend to stay longer around their homes . therefore , they meet with each other more frequently as the distance between their homes is closer , which naturally includes social relations between the walkers .",
    "in this paper , we focused on contact frequency for _",
    "however , that of _ animals _ might also obey the same principles because the above two mechanisms are common to animals and humans : animals usually have nests that are similar to our homes , and they also travel to distant feeding sites .    for future works , it is also important to consider effects of non - uniformity of population density . in the simulations , we used the average population density of japan , but the density of people highly varies by the size of city where they live .",

    "we think our mobility model is useful for performance evaluation of routing protocols in delay tolerant networks ( dtn ) @xcite since some protocols selects routing paths with frequent encounters in utility - based routing protocols , such as prophet @xcite , maxprop @xcite , and so on .",
    "we also have proposed our algorithm for routing in dtn and have shown some results regarding the comparison between lw and hlw @xcite , which indicates that the arrival rate of transferred messages tends to be much lower as increasing the homesick probability @xmath23 .",
    "it is also important to take into consideration the effect of ichi - go ichi - e since the large number of human encounters is rare .",
    "therefore , the majority of human encounters usually does nt contribute to the performance of the utility - based routing , but they only consume much memory in vain for memorizing the history of encounters with many nodes that will never be encountered again . after understanding the properties of the frequency of human contact well , the routing protocols for message transfer could be improved .",
