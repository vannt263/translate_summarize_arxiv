    "in parper @xcite the approach to calculate mechanical properties of levitation systems with melt - processed high temperature superconductors ( mp hts ) was introduced .",
    "the approach starts from an ` ideally hard superconductor ' approximation which assumes that the penetration depth @xmath0 of alternating magnetic field is zero . within this ` zero ' approximation",
    "the stiffness or resonance frequencies in the permanent magnet ( pm)mp hts system can be calculated analytically and appeared to be in a good agreement with the experiment @xcite , but to calculate energy loss due to pm motion @xcite or hysteresis of levitation force @xcite the next ( ` first ' ) approximation has to be used and finite values of @xmath0 have to be considered .    in @xcite we have shown , that the energy loss @xmath1 in the pm  hts system during pm oscillations is mostly determined by ac loss in the hts undersurface layer @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the tangential component of ac field at the hts surface @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the critical current density in @xmath6-plane for field parallel to this plane , and for initial mp samples can be subdivided into two parts : @xmath7 .",
    "the first part is well known bulk hysteretic loss within critical state model from which @xmath5 @xcite and even its profiles @xcite can be determined . in this paper",
    "we consider the second part of @xmath1 and investigate the effect of surface treatment ( polishing ) on @xmath8 dependence .",
    "we discuss a possibility for thermal activation through surface barrier to be detected here and introduce an idea of dynamic surface barrier appearance .",
    "fig .  [ fig1 ] represents the experimental dependencies of inverse @xmath9-factor of pm forced oscillations at resonance frequency @xmath10 on pm amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is storage energy .",
    "symbols represent the data for the mp hts sample with polished top surface ; dotted line shows @xmath14 dependence for depolished sample .    to explain the presence of the part of @xmath1 which is @xmath15 , a motion of perpendicular to the surface vortices with an amplitude @xmath16 was considered . in axially symmetrical configuration @xmath17 , due to small value of @xmath0",
    ", we can say that normal to the surface ac magnetic field component @xmath18 is determined by @xmath19 distribution : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the parallel to surface magnetic flux variation .",
    "this is true for @xmath22 which in our case is reinforced by anisotropy : @xmath23 .",
    "the function @xmath24 can be obtained from the equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is distribution of normal component of ` frozen ' magnetic field .",
    "in such a way we have shown that for hts with uniform bulk properties both parts of ac loss are related to vortex motion in hts volume .    by polishing the surface of sample",
    "we introduce a surface barrier for flux entry which causes a field jump @xmath27 in undersurface ` vortex free region ' @xcite .",
    "the influence of @xmath28 on @xmath1 can be taken into account by substitution @xmath29 instead of @xmath3 and adding the surface loss as it was made by clem @xcite .",
    "the dependence @xmath14 which is obtained in such a way is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] as a dashed line .",
    "so , we can deduce that experimental data show transition from absence of barrier at @xmath30 to distinguish barrier at @xmath31 , and the first reason which comes to mind here is thermally activated flux penetration over the barrier @xcite , but it seems to be impossible to describe the experimentally observed barrier disappearence at small @xmath32 using the relations from @xcite .",
    "this makes to suppose another possible mechanism to suppress the surface effect at low amplitudes .",
    "it is quite natural to expect that the barrier leads to @xmath28 not at whole surface but at its part @xmath33 only .",
    "the reason for this is nonuniform flux penetration : when a part of vortex or vortex bundle has penetrated into hts , the further penetration can take place without surmounting the barrier but with vortex propagation along the surface . fixing vortex velocity",
    "the part of vortices that penetrates through barrier can be calculated by energy loss minimizing .",
    "we have found : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 oe .",
    "then ac loss @xmath37 the dependence ( [ 2 ] ) is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] by solid line .",
    "dashed line and dotted line represents the dependencies @xmath8 for @xmath38 and 1 respectively .",
