    "the most restrictive version of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) with gauge coupling unification is based on radiative electroweak breaking with universal boundary conditions from gravity - mediated soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking and is known as constrained mssm ( cmssm ) .",
    "it is desirable to further restrict this model by assuming that the @xmath5-quark , @xmath1-quark and @xmath6-lepton yukawa couplings unify ` asymptotically ' , i.e. , at the susy grand unified theory ( gut ) scale @xmath7 .",
    "this assumption ( yukawa unification ) naturally restricts @xcite the @xmath5-quark mass to large values compatible with the data . also , the emerging model is highly predictive .",
    "yukawa unification can be achieved by embedding the mssm in a susy gut with a gauge group containing @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , assuming that the electroweak higgs superfields @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the third family right handed quark superfields @xmath12 , @xmath13 form @xmath9 doublets , we obtain @xcite the ` asymptotic ' yukawa coupling relation @xmath14 and , hence , large @xmath15 . moreover",
    ", if the third generation quark and lepton @xmath16 doublets ( singlets ) @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( @xmath13 and @xmath19 ) form a @xmath8 4-plet ( @xmath20-plet ) and the higgs doublet @xmath10 which couples to them is a @xmath8 singlet , we get @xmath21 and the ` asymptotic ' relation @xmath22 follows .",
    "the simplest gut gauge group which contains both @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the pati - salam ( ps ) group @xmath23 .",
    "higher groups with the same property are @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",
    "one problem , which is faced in trying to incorporate yukawa unification into the cmssm , is due to the generation of sizeable susy corrections to @xmath26 @xcite which have the same sign as the mssm parameter @xmath27 .",
    "consequently , for @xmath2 , the tree - level @xmath28 , which is predicted @xcite ( the sign of @xmath27 in this reference is opposite to the one adopted here ) from yukawa unification already above the @xmath29 confidence level ( c.l . )",
    "experimental range @xmath30 , receives large positive corrections .",
    "this range is derived from the @xmath29 c.l .",
    "range for @xmath31 in the @xmath32 renormalization scheme which is found @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) to be @xmath33 .",
    "this is evolved @xcite up to @xmath34 via the three - loop @xmath32 renormalization group ( rg ) equations @xcite with @xmath35 and then converted to the @xmath36 scheme using the appropriate one - loop factor @xcite . for @xmath37 ,",
    "the tree - level @xmath28 is @xcite smaller and close to the upper edge of the above range .",
    "however , the radiative corrections are now negative and drive @xmath28 below this range .",
    "the discrepancy is , though , considerably smaller than in the @xmath2 case .",
    "we see that , for both signs of @xmath27 , the hypothesis of exact yukawa unification leads to an unacceptable @xmath1-quark mass . however , we are not obliged to abandon yukawa unification altogether .",
    "we can rather modestly correct it by including an extra @xmath8 non - singlet higgs superfield with yukawa couplings to the quarks and leptons .",
    "the higgs @xmath16 doublets contained in this superfield can naturally develop @xcite subdominant vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) and mix with the main electroweak doublets which are assumed to be @xmath8 singlets and form a @xmath9 doublet .",
    "this mixing can , in general , violate @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the resulting electroweak higgs doublets @xmath38 , @xmath39 do not form a @xmath9 doublet and also break @xmath8 . the required deviation from exact yukawa unification",
    "is expected to be more pronounced in the @xmath2 case . despite this",
    ", we choose to study here this case since , for @xmath37 , the present experimental data @xcite on the inclusive decay @xmath3 restrict @xcite the sparticle masses to considerably higher values and , thus , this case is phenomenologically less interesting .",
    "moreover , the recent results @xcite on the muon anomalous magnetic moment also imply heavy sparticles for @xmath37 ( see below ) .",
    "we will construct here a concrete susy gut model which naturally leads to a modest deviation from yukawa unification allowing an acceptable @xmath28 even with universal boundary conditions .",
    "( for models which violate universality rather than yukawa unification see ref.@xcite . )",
    "we will then show that this model possesses a wide range of parameters which is consistent with all the phenomenological and cosmological constraints .",
    "we consider only the @xmath2 case , which is experimentally more attractive .    in sec.[model",
    "] , we construct a susy gut model which is based on the ps gauge group and provides , in a natural way , a suppressed violation of yukawa unification .",
    "variants of this model which can yield bigger deviations from yukawa unification are also presented . in sec.[mssm ] , we concentrate on one of these variants which can violate yukawa unification by an amount that is adequate for @xmath2 .",
    "we then describe the resulting mssm under the assumption of universal boundary conditions and introduce the various phenomenological and cosmological requirements which restrict its parameter space . in sec.[parameters ] , we study the range of parameters which is compatible with all these requirements in this particular cmssm . finally , in sec.[conclusions ] , we summarize our conclusions .",
    "we take the susy gut model of ref.@xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) as our starting point .",
    "this is based on the ps gauge group @xmath40 , which is the simplest gauge group that can lead to yukawa unification .",
    "the ` matter ' superfields are @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , while the electroweak higgs doublets belong to the superfield @xmath44 .",
    "so , all the requirements for exact yukawa unification are fulfilled .",
    "the breaking of @xmath40 down to the standard model ( sm ) gauge group @xmath45 is achieved by the superheavy vevs ( @xmath46 ) of the right handed neutrino type components of a conjugate pair of higgs superfields @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "the model also contains a gauge singlet @xmath49 which triggers the breaking of @xmath40 , a @xmath8 6-plet @xmath50 which gives @xcite masses to the right handed down quark type components of @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and a pair of gauge singlets @xmath53 , @xmath54 for solving @xcite the @xmath27 problem of the mssm via a peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry .",
    "in addition to @xmath40 , the model possesses two global @xmath55 symmetries , namely a pq and a r symmetry , as well as a @xmath56 symmetry ( ` matter parity ' ) under which @xmath57 , @xmath58 change sign . for details on the charge assignments , the full superpotential and the phenomenological and cosmological properties of this model , the reader is referred to ref.@xcite .",
    "a moderate violation of yukawa unification can be accommodated in this model by adding a new higgs superfield @xmath59 with yukawa couplings @xmath60 .",
    "actually , this is the only representation , besides ( 1,2,2 ) , which possesses such couplings to the fermions .",
    "the existence of these couplings requires that the quantum numbers of @xmath61 coincide with the ones of @xmath62 .",
    "so , its pq and r charges are @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively . in order to give superheavy masses to the color non - singlet components of @xmath61",
    ", we need to include one more higgs superfield @xmath65 with the superpotential coupling @xmath66 , whose coefficient is of the order of @xmath67 . the field",
    "@xmath68 then has @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the full superpotential which is consistent with all the symmetries contains , in addition to the couplings mentioned above and in ref.@xcite , the following extra terms too : @xmath71 note that all the superpotential terms can be multiplied by arbitrary powers of the combinations @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "the first two couplings in eq.([couplings ] ) ( as well as all the ` new ' couplings containing @xmath72 , @xmath73 ) give rise to additional baryon and lepton number violation . however , their contribution to proton decay is subdominant to the one discussed in ref.@xcite and proton remains practically stable .",
    "let us now discuss how the introduction of @xmath68 , @xmath61 can lead to a moderate correction of exact yukawa unification .",
    "the higgs field @xmath61 contains two color singlet @xmath16 doublets @xmath75 , @xmath76 which , after the breaking of @xmath40 to @xmath45 , can mix with the corresponding doublets @xmath77 , @xmath78 in @xmath62 .",
    "this is mainly due to the terms @xmath66 , @xmath79 .",
    "the latter , being non - renormalizable , is suppressed by the string scale @xmath80 .",
    "actually , @xmath79 corresponds to two independent couplings .",
    "one of them is between the @xmath9 singlets in @xmath74 and @xmath81 , and the other between the @xmath9 triplets in these combinations .",
    "the singlet ( triplet ) coupling , after the breaking of @xmath40 to @xmath45 , generates @xmath9 invariant ( violating ) bilinear terms between the doublets in @xmath68 and @xmath62 .",
    "so , we finally obtain two bilinear terms @xmath82 and @xmath83 with different coefficients , which are suppressed by @xmath84 .",
    "these terms together with the terms @xmath85 and @xmath86 from @xmath66 , which have equal coefficients , generate different mixings between @xmath77 , @xmath75 and @xmath78 , @xmath76 .",
    "consequently , the resulting electroweak doublets @xmath38 , @xmath39 contain @xmath8 violating components suppressed by @xmath84 and fail to form a @xmath9 doublet by an equally suppressed amount .",
    "so , yukawa unification is moderately violated .",
    "unfortunately , as it turns out , this violation is not adequate for correcting the @xmath1-quark mass for @xmath2 .    in order to allow for a more sizable violation of yukawa unification",
    ", we further extend the model by including a superfield @xmath87 with the coupling @xmath88 .",
    "the field @xmath89 is then neutral under both the pq and r symmetries . to give superheavy masses to the color non - singlets in @xmath89",
    ", we introduce one more superfield @xmath90 with the coupling @xmath91 , whose coefficient is of order @xmath67 .",
    "the charges of @xmath92 are @xmath93 , @xmath70 .",
    "additional superpotential couplings which are allowed by the symmetries of the model are : @xmath94 multiplications of the superpotential terms by @xmath89 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 are generally allowed with the exception of the multiplication of the @xmath40 singlets @xmath49 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 by a single @xmath89 , which is a @xmath8 15-plet .",
    "the terms @xmath91 and @xmath97 imply that , after the breaking of @xmath40 to @xmath45 , the field @xmath89 acquires a superheavy vev of order @xmath67 .",
    "the coupling @xmath88 then generates @xmath9 violating unsuppressed bilinear terms between the doublets in @xmath68 and @xmath62 .",
    "these terms can certainly overshadow the corresponding ones from the non - renormalizable term @xmath79 .",
    "the resulting @xmath9 violating mixing of the doublets in @xmath62 and @xmath61 is then unsuppressed and we can obtain stronger violation of yukawa unification .    instead of the pair @xmath92 , @xmath89 one can use a pair of @xmath9 singlet superfields @xmath98 , @xmath99 with the same pq and r charges and the couplings @xmath100 and @xmath101 . in this case , the mixing is @xmath9 invariant and the ` asymptotic ' relation @xmath14 is not violated .",
    "the additional superpotential couplings allowed by the symmetries are : @xmath102 note the absence of the couplings @xmath103 , @xmath104 which are @xmath9 triplets .",
    "multiplications of the superpotential terms by @xmath105 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 are generally allowed with the exception of the multiplication of @xmath49 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 by a single @xmath105 , which is a @xmath8 15-plet , or a single @xmath106 , @xmath107 , which are @xmath9 triplets .",
    "finally , one could introduce both the pairs @xmath92 , @xmath89 and @xmath108 , @xmath105 at the same time .",
    "the allowed superpotential terms include all the above mentioned terms and @xmath109 multiplications of the superpotential terms by @xmath89 , @xmath105 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 are generally allowed with the exception of the multiplication of @xmath49 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 by a single factor of @xmath89 , @xmath105 , @xmath110 , which are @xmath8 15-plets , or a single factor of @xmath106 , @xmath107 . also ,",
    "multiplication of @xmath101 by a single @xmath89 is not allowed .    to further analyze the mixing of the doublets in @xmath62 and @xmath61",
    ", we must first define properly the relevant couplings @xmath66 , @xmath88 and @xmath100 . the superfield @xmath44 is written as @xmath111 the color singlet components of the fields @xmath68 , @xmath61 can be similarly represented . under @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 ,",
    "the relevant fields transforms as : @xmath115 where the transpose of a matrix is denoted by tilde .",
    "the yukawa couplings are @xmath116 , @xmath117 . from eq.([transformations ] ) and the identities @xmath118 ( @xmath119 is the @xmath120 antisymmetric matrix with @xmath121 ) which follow from @xmath122 , one finds that @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 .",
    "we see that @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 ( the traces are taken with respect to the @xmath8 and @xmath16 indices ) are invariant under @xmath40 .",
    "they correspond to the ` symbolic ' couplings @xmath66 , @xmath88 , @xmath100 respectively .",
    "after the breaking of @xmath40 to @xmath45 , the fields @xmath89 , @xmath105 acquire vevs @xmath129 , @xmath130 . substituting them by these vevs in the above couplings and using eq.([ewhiggs ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath131 where only the colorless components of @xmath68 and @xmath61 are shown in the right hand side of eq.([mass ] ) and @xmath132 .",
    "the bilinear terms between @xmath77 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath78 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 which appear in eqs.([mass ] ) , ( [ triplet ] ) and ( [ singlet ] ) turn out to be the dominant bilinear terms between these doublets . collecting them together , we obtain @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the superheavy mass parameter which multiplies the term in eq.([mass ] ) and @xmath139 , @xmath140 with @xmath141 and @xmath142 being the dimensionless coupling constants which correspond to the @xmath9 triplet and singlet terms in eqs.([triplet ] ) and ( [ singlet ] ) respectively . note that @xmath143 , @xmath144 are in general complex .",
    "so , we get two pairs of superheavy doublets with mass @xmath138 .",
    "they are predominantly given by @xmath145 the orthogonal combinations of @xmath77 , @xmath134 and @xmath78 , @xmath136 constitute the electroweak doublets : @xmath146    we see that , although @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath134 , @xmath136 form @xmath9 doublets , this is , in general , not true for @xmath38 , @xmath39 since @xmath143 , @xmath147 can be different .",
    "however , if we remove from the model the @xmath9 triplets @xmath92 , @xmath89 ( and , thus , the @xmath9 triplet coupling in eq.([triplet ] ) ) , we obtain @xmath148 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 do form a @xmath9 doublet .",
    "the minimal model which can provide us with an adequate violation of @xmath149 yukawa unification for @xmath2 is the one including @xmath92 , @xmath89 but not the @xmath9 singlets @xmath150 , @xmath105 .",
    "this model , which we choose to study in detail here , yields @xmath151 .",
    "inclusion of both @xmath92 , @xmath89 and @xmath150 , @xmath105 can lead to an arbitrary relation between @xmath143 and @xmath147 and , thus , introduces an extra complex parameter .",
    "finally , due to the presence of @xmath134 , @xmath136 , the electroweak doublets are generally non - singlets under @xmath8 and @xmath152 yukawa unification can also be violated .",
    "the doublets in eq.([superdoublets ] ) must have zero vevs , which implies that @xmath153 , @xmath154 .",
    "eq.([ew ] ) then gives @xmath155 , @xmath156 .",
    "from the third generation yukawa couplings @xmath157 , @xmath158 , we obtain @xmath159 where @xmath160 and can be taken positive by appropriately readjusting the phases of @xmath62 , @xmath61 .",
    "note that , in the @xmath8 space , the doublets in @xmath61 are proportional to @xmath161 , which is normalized so that the trace of its square equals unity .",
    "thus , to make @xmath162 directly comparable to @xmath163 , we included a factor of two in defining the corresponding yukawa coupling .",
    "the masses @xmath26 , @xmath164 are , similarly , found : @xmath165 from eqs.([top ] ) and ( [ bottomtau ] ) , we see that the exact equality of the ` asymptotic ' yukawa couplings @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 is now replaced by the quasi - unification condition : @xmath169 this condition depends on two complex ( @xmath143 , @xmath144 ) and one real ( @xmath170 ) parameter .",
    "note that the mixing between @xmath77 , @xmath75 ( i.e. , @xmath171 ) and the fact that the higgs superfield @xmath61 possesses yukawa couplings to the ` matter ' superfields ( i.e. , @xmath172 ) are crucial for violating @xmath152 yukawa unification , which is though not affected by the mixing between @xmath78 , @xmath76 ( i.e. , the value of @xmath144 ) . on the contrary ,",
    "violation of @xmath149 yukawa unification requires that @xmath173 , which can be achieved only in the presence of a @xmath9 triplet bilinear term between @xmath68 and @xmath62 . in summary ,",
    "the minimal requirements for full violation of yukawa unification are @xmath174 , @xmath173 . in the minimal model ( with @xmath175 , @xmath89 but",
    "not @xmath108 , @xmath105 ) which we will study here , @xmath176 and , thus , eq.([quasi ] ) takes the simple form @xmath177 where @xmath178 .",
    "this ` asymptotic ' relation depends on a single complex parameter . for simplicity",
    ", we will restrict our analysis to real values of @xmath179 only .    for completeness",
    ", we also give the ` asymptotic ' relation between the yukawa couplings in the model without @xmath175 , @xmath89 , @xmath108 , @xmath105 , which , although not suitable for @xmath2 , may be adequate for @xmath37 . under @xmath40 , the superfields @xmath51 , @xmath52",
    "transform as : @xmath180 , @xmath181 .",
    "thus , @xmath182 , and @xmath183 is invariant under @xmath40 containing both the @xmath9 singlet and triplet ` symbolic ' couplings @xmath184 . in the @xmath9 space , @xmath185 , where @xmath186 , with @xmath187 being the gut gauge coupling constant , and @xmath188 is the unit @xmath120 matrix .",
    "moreover , in the @xmath8 space , @xmath189 .",
    "so , replacing @xmath51 , @xmath52 by their vevs in the singlet and triplet couplings in @xmath183 ( with dimensionless coefficients equal to @xmath190 and @xmath191 ) , we obtain @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "we , thus , again end up with eq.([quasi ] ) but with @xmath194 , @xmath195 , which are suppressed by @xmath84 .",
    "we will now concentrate on the minimal model which includes @xmath175 , @xmath89 but not @xmath108 , @xmath105 .",
    "this model , below @xmath67 , reduces to the mssm supplemented by the ` asymptotic ' yukawa coupling quasi - unification condition in eq.([minimal ] ) , where @xmath179 is taken real for simplicity",

    "so the resulting mssm is actually the cmssm .",
    "furthermore , we will concentrate on the @xmath2 case for reasons which we already explained .",
    "we will closely follow the notation as well as the rg and radiative electroweak breaking analysis of ref.@xcite for the cmssm with the improvements of ref.@xcite ( recall that the sign of @xmath27 in these references is opposite to the one adopted here ) .",
    "these improvements include the employment of the full one - loop corrections to the effective potential for the electroweak breaking and to certain particle masses taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "they also include the incorporation of the two - loop corrections to the cp - even neutral higgs boson mass matrix by using feynhiggsfast @xcite and the introduction @xcite of a variable common susy threshold @xmath199 ( @xmath200 are the stop mass eigenstates ) where the effective potential is minimized , @xmath201 ( the cp - odd higgs boson mass ) and @xmath27 are evaluated , and the mssm rg equations are replaced by the sm ones .",
    "note that , at @xmath202 , the size of the one - loop corrections to @xmath201 and @xmath27 is @xcite minimal and , thus , the accuracy in the determination of these quantities is maximal .",

    "we use fixed values for the running top quark mass @xmath204 and the running tau lepton mass @xmath205 and incorporate not only the susy correction to the bottom quark mass but also the susy threshold correction to @xmath206 from the approximate formula of ref.@xcite .",
    "this correction arises mainly from chargino / tau sneutrino ( @xmath207 ) loops and , for @xmath2 , leads @xcite to a small reduction of @xmath203 .    after imposing the conditions of gauge coupling unification , successful electroweak breaking and yukawa quasi - unification in eq.([minimal ] ) ,",

    "we calculate @xmath217 using the formalism of ref.@xcite , where the sm contribution is factorized out .",
    "this contribution includes the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd and the leading order ( lo ) qed corrections . the charged higgs boson contribution to @xmath217",

    "the dominant susy contribution includes the nlo qcd corrections from ref.@xcite , which hold for large @xmath203 ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the error in the sm contribution to @xmath217 is made of two components .",
    "the first is due to the propagation of the experimental errors in the input parameters and is @xcite about @xmath218 .",

    "the asymmetric error coming from model dependence ( @xmath216\\times 10^{-4}$ ] ) and the error from scale dependence ( @xmath222 ) are then added linearly @xcite on both ends of the @xmath223 range . for simplicity , we take a constant error from scale dependence , which we evaluate at the central experimental value of @xmath217 . the @xmath29 c.l .",
    "range of this branching ratio then turns out to be about @xmath224 .",

    "this range is derived using the calculations ( see e.g. , ref.@xcite ) of @xmath226 in the sm which are based on the evaluation of the hadronic vacuum polarization contribution of ref.@xcite .",
    "however , we take here the recently corrected @xcite sign of the pseudoscalar pole contribution to the light - by - light scattering correction to @xmath226 .",
    "this corrected sign reduces considerably the discrepancy between the sm and the measured value of @xmath226 .",
    "it also relaxes the restrictions on the parameter space of the cmssm .",

    "another constraint results from the requirement that the relic abundance @xmath231 of the lsp in the universe does not exceed the upper limit on the cold dark matter ( cdm ) abundance which is derived from observations ( @xmath232 is the present energy density of the lsp over the critical energy density of the universe and @xmath62 is the present value of the hubble parameter in units of @xmath233 ) . from the recent results of dasi @xcite , one finds that the @xmath29 c.l .",

    "( a similar calculation has appeared in ref.@xcite . )",
    "it includes all the coannihilations @xcite of neutralinos , charginos , sleptons , squarks and gluinos .",
    "the exact tree - level cross sections are used and are accurately thermally averaged .",
    "also , poles and thresholds are properly handled and one - loop qcd corrected higgs decay widths @xcite are used , which is the main improvement provided by ref.@xcite .",
    "the susy corrections @xcite to these widths are , however , not included .",
    "fortunately , in our case , their effect is much smaller than that of the qcd corrections .    in order to have an independent check of micromegas",
    ", we also use the following alternative method for calculating @xmath231 in our model . in most of the parameter space where coannihilations are unimportant , @xmath231 can be calculated by using darksusy @xcite .",
    "this code employs the complete tree - level ( and in some cases one - loop ) cross sections of the relevant processes with properly treating all resonances and thresholds and performs accurate numerical integration of the boltzmann equation .",
    "its neutralino annihilation part is in excellent numerical agreement with the recent exact analytic calculation of ref.@xcite .",
    "moreover , it includes all coannihilations between neutralinos and charginos which are , however , insignificant for our model .",
    "its main defect is that it uses the tree - level higgs decay widths .",
    "this can be approximately corrected if , in evaluating the higgs decay widths , we replace @xmath31 by @xmath26 at the mass of the appropriate higgs boson in the couplings of the @xmath1-quark to the higgs bosons ( see ref.@xcite ) .    in the region of the parameter space where coannihilations come into play ,",
    "the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) turns out to be the @xmath212 and the only relevant coannihilations are the bino - stau ones @xcite . in this region , which is given by @xmath236 , we calculate @xmath231 by using an improved version of the analysis of ref.@xcite ( the sign of @xmath27 in this reference is opposite to the one adopted here ) .",
    "this analysis , which has been applied in refs.@xcite , includes bino - stau coannihilations for all @xmath203 s ( see also refs.@xcite ) and is based on a series expansion of the thermally averaged cross sections in @xmath237 , with @xmath238 being the freeze - out temperature .",
    "this expansion is , however , inadequate when we have to treat resonances , and these are crucial for bino annihilation .",
    "so , we need to improve the bino annihilation part in ref.@xcite . this can be achieved by evaluating the corresponding expansion coefficients @xmath239 and @xmath240 not as in this reference but as follows . from darksusy",
    ", we find the values of @xmath241 and @xmath242 which correspond to essentially just bino annihilation .",
    "using the appropriate formulas of ref.@xcite , we then extract the ` improved ' expansion coefficients @xmath239 and @xmath240 .",
    "there is one more improvement which we need to do in ref.@xcite ( and was already used in ref.@xcite ) to make it applicable to the present case .",
    "the cross sections of the processes @xmath243 were calculated without including the tree - graphs with @xmath207 exchange in the t - channel @xcite .",
    "thus , the contribution to @xmath244 from the process @xmath245 appearing in table ii of ref.@xcite should be corrected by adding to it @xmath246 @xmath247 , \\label{ww}\\ ] ] with @xmath248 .",
    "also , the contribution to @xmath244 from @xmath249 is now given by eq.(26 ) of ref.@xcite with the expression in the last parenthesis corrected by adding to it the quantity @xmath250 , where @xmath251/\\sqrt{2}m_w\\ ] ] ( with the present sign convention for @xmath27 ) . the resulting correction to @xmath241 , in the case of the process @xmath252 , varies from about @xmath253 to about @xmath254 as @xmath255 increases from 0 to 0.25 .",
    "on the contrary , the correction from @xmath256 is negligible .",
    "we find that the alternative method for calculating the neutralino relic abundance in our model , which we have just described , yields results which are in excellent agreement with micromegas . in practice , however , we use the code micromegas since it has the extra advantage of being much faster",
    ".    we will also impose the @xmath29 c.l .",
    "lep bound on the lightest cp - even neutral higgs boson mass @xmath257 @xcite . in the cmssm , this bound holds almost always for all @xmath203 s , at least as long as cp is conserved .",
    "finally , for the values of @xmath203 which appear here ( about 60 ) , the cdf results yield the @xmath29 c.l .",

    "the constraints @xmath268 and @xmath269 do not restrict the parameters since they are always satisfied for @xmath2 .",
    "the left solid line depicts the lower bound on @xmath208 from @xmath257 which does not depend much on @xmath28 , while the right solid line corresponds to @xmath270 for the central value of @xmath28 .",
    "we observe that the lower bounds on @xmath208 are generally not so sensitive to the variations of @xmath28 within its @xmath29 c.l .",
    "the most sensitive of these bounds is the one from @xmath258 , while the bound from @xmath257 is practically @xmath28-independent .",
    "actually , this bound overshadows all the other lower bounds for all @xmath255 s and , being essentially @xmath255-independent too , sets , for @xmath261 and @xmath35 , an overall constant @xmath29 c.l .",
    "lower bound on @xmath208 of about @xmath271 .",
    "contrary to the lower bounds , the line from the lsp relic abundance is extremely sensitive to the value of @xmath28 . in particular ,",
    "its almost vertical part is considerably displaced to higher @xmath208 s as @xmath28 decreases .",
    "we will explain this behavior later .    in fig .",
    ", we depict @xmath201 and @xmath202 versus @xmath208 for various @xmath255 s , @xmath261 and the central values of @xmath28 and @xmath272 .",
    "we see that @xmath201 is always smaller than @xmath273 but close to it . thus , generally , the neutralino annihilation via the s - channel exchange of an @xmath274-boson is by far the dominant ( co)annihilation process .",
    "we also observe that , as @xmath208 or @xmath255 increase , we move away from the @xmath274-pole , which thus becomes less efficient . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath231 increases with @xmath208 or @xmath255 ( see fig . ) .    in fig .",

    "the crosses are from the alternative method described in sec.[mssm ] , which combines darksusy with the bino - stau coannihilation calculation of ref.@xcite . in order to mimic , in darksusy , the effect of the one - loop qcd corrections to the higgs decay widths",
    ", we can generally use the @xmath1-quark mass ( including the susy corrections ) evaluated at @xmath201 since the @xmath274-pole is by far the most important . as it turns out",
    ", @xmath275 depends very weakly on the values of the input parameters @xmath208 and @xmath255 , and thus the uniform use of a constant mean value of @xmath275 should be adequate .",
    "we find that excellent agreement between micromegas and our alternative method is achieve if , in darksusy , we use a constant default value for the @xmath1-quark mass which is equal to about @xmath276 ( see fig . ) .",
    "the importance for our calculation of the one - loop qcd corrections to the higgs decay widths can be easily concluded from fig . , where we show @xmath231 versus @xmath208 for @xmath277 , @xmath261 and the central values of @xmath28 , @xmath272 .",
    "the lsp relic abundance is calculated by micromegas with ( thick solid line ) or without ( faint solid line ) the inclusion of the one - loop qcd corrections to the higgs widths .",
    "we see that the results differ appreciably . for comparison",
    ", we also draw @xmath231 calculated by our alternative method with ( thick crosses ) or without ( faint crosses ) the above ` correction ' of the @xmath1-quark mass .",
    "the agreement with micromegas is really impressive in both cases .    in fig . , we present @xmath201 and @xmath202 as functions of @xmath208 for @xmath277 , @xmath261 and with the lower , upper and central values of @xmath28 for @xmath35 . we see that @xmath201 increases and approaches @xmath273 as @xmath28 decreases . as a consequence ,",
    "the effect of the @xmath274-pole is considerably enhanced and @xmath231 is reduced .",
    "this explains the large displacement of the vertical part of the @xmath270 line in fig .  at low @xmath28 s .",
    "as @xmath255 becomes small and approaches zero , bino - stau coannihilations become very important and strongly dominate over the pole annihilation of neutralinos .",
    "this leads to a very pronounced reduction of the neutralino relic abundance and , consequently , to a drastic increase of the upper bound on @xmath208 .",
    "we , thus , obtain the almost horizontal parts of the @xmath270 lines in fig ..    the shaded area depicted in fig .",
    ", which lies between the @xmath278 line and the @xmath270 line corresponding to the central value of @xmath28 , constitutes the allowed range in the @xmath279 plane for @xmath261 , @xmath264 and @xmath35 . for practical reasons , we limited our investigation to @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",

    ", the parameter @xmath179 ( @xmath203 ) varies between about 0.15 and 0.20 ( 58 and 59 ) . for @xmath28",
    "fixed to its lower or upper bound , we find that , in the corresponding allowed area , the parameter @xmath179 ( @xmath203 ) ranges between about 0.17 and 0.23 ( 59 and 61 ) or 0.13 and 0.17 ( 56 and 58 ) .",
    "we observe that , as we increase @xmath28 , the parameter @xmath179 decreases and we get closer to exact yukawa unification .",

    "@xmath272 was fixed to its central experimental value ( equal to 0.1185 ) throughout our calculation .",
    "we could , however , let it vary in its @xmath29 c.l .",

    "range of @xmath28 to @xmath294 , with the lower ( upper ) bound corresponding to the upper ( lower ) bound on @xmath272 .",
    "this would lead to a sizable enlargement of the allowed area due to the sensitivity of the lsp relic abundance to the @xmath1-quark mass .    in figs . ,  and , we present the restrictions on the @xmath295 plane for @xmath264 , @xmath35 , and @xmath296 respectively .",

    "note that , in fig . , the upper bound on @xmath208 does not appear since it lies at @xmath297 .",
    "this is due to the fact that , since the bino and stau masses are degenerate in this case , the bino - stau coannihilation is considerably enhanced leading to a strong reduction of the lsp relic abundance . in order to illustrate the quick reduction of @xmath231 as @xmath255 approaches zero , we display in fig .  the bounds from @xmath267 ( double dot - dashed lines ) for @xmath298 too .",
    "the reduction of @xmath231 by bino - stau coannihilation is also the reason for the fact that the allowed ( shaded ) areas in figs . ,  and  are more sizable for smaller @xmath255 s .",
    "the lower bound on @xmath208 overshadows all the other lower bounds in all cases and is only very mildly dependent on @xmath255 .    in figs .  and",

    "the minimal value of @xmath208 is , though , not much affected by varying @xmath28 .",
    "variations of @xmath272 , however , lead to small ( @xmath306 ) fluctuations of the minimal @xmath208 .",
    "we see that the required deviation from yukawa unification , for @xmath2 , is not so small . in spite of this ,",
    "the restrictions from yukawa unification are not completely lost but only somewhat weakened . in particular",
    ", @xmath203 remains large and close to 60 .",
    "actually , our model is much closer to yukawa unification than generic models where the yukawa couplings can differ even by orders of magnitude .",
    "also , the deviation from yukawa unification is generated here in a natural , systematic , controlled and well - motivated way .",
    "finally , recall that the required size of the violation of yukawa unification forced us to extend the initial model of sec.[model ] which could only provide a suppressed violation .",
    "we constructed a class of concrete susy guts based on the ps gauge group which naturally lead to a moderate violation of ` asymptotic ' yukawa unification so that the @xmath1-quark mass can take acceptable values even with universal boundary conditions . for @xmath37 ,",
    "a suppressed deviation from yukawa unification may be adequate , while , for @xmath2 , a more sizable deviation is required . in the @xmath37 case , however , the sparticles are considerably heavier due to the constraints from @xmath3 and the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "so , the @xmath2 case is more attractive for experimenters .",
    "we considered a particular susy gut from the above class with a deviation from yukawa unification which is adequate for @xmath2 .",
    "we then discussed the resulting mssm under the assumption of universal boundary conditions and the various phenomenological and cosmological requirements which restrict its parameter space .",
    "they originate from the data on the inclusive branching ratio of @xmath3 , the muon anomalous magnetic moment , the cdm abundance in the universe , and the masses @xmath307 and @xmath201 .",
    "the calculation of @xmath217 incorporates all the lo qed and nlo qcd corrections which hold for large values of @xmath203 , while the lsp contribution to @xmath308 is evaluated by using the code micromegas which includes all possible coannihilation processes , treats poles properly and uses the one - loop qcd corrected higgs decay widths .",
    "we also employed an alternative method for estimating the lsp relic abundance and found excellent agreement with micromegas .",
    "we showed that , in the particular model with yukawa quasi - unification considered , there exists a wide and natural range of cmssm parameters which is consistent with all the above constraints .",
    "we found that , within the investigated part of the overall allowed parameter space , the parameter @xmath203 ranges between about 58 and 61 and the ` asymptotic ' splitting between the bottom ( or tau ) and the top yukawa couplings varies in the range @xmath303 for central values of @xmath28 and @xmath272 .",
