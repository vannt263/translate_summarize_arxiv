    "the usual approach is to write the dse for the fermion propagator or self - energy , possibly including equations for the photon vacuum polarization or the fermion - photon proper vertex . in a recent study",

    "there have been several studies which attempted to make the fermion dse gauge - covariant by using improved vertex forms which satisfy the wti but which possess kinematic singularities in the limit of zero photon momentum @xcite .",
    "a general form for @xmath5 which does satisfy the ward identity and which has no unphysical kinematic singularities was given by ball and chiu in 1980 @xcite ; it consists of a minimal longitudinally constrained term which satisfies the wti , and a set of tensors spanning the subspace transverse to the photon momentum @xmath6 .",

    "typically these studies have assumed an initially massless theory and have renormalized at the ultraviolet cutoff of the loop integration , taking @xmath7 .",
    "where a nonzero bare mass has been used , it has simply been added to the scalar term in the propagator .",
    "while in some circumstances for the special case of landau gauge this can be a reasonable approximation , it is in general incorrect .",
    "although there have been earlier formal discussions of renormalization @xcite , the important step of subtractive renormalization had not been performed prior to the recent study in landau gauge @xcite .    here",
    "we present the results of a study of subtractive renormalization in the fermion dse in _ arbitrary _ covariant gauge for quenched strong - coupling qed@xmath0 .",
