    "unification of gauge couplings has always been one of the few solid pieces of evidence in favor of supersymmetry .",

    "the resolution of this discrepancy has been the subject of many studies and several paths to unification have been proposed  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it is remarkable that , in the non - supersymmetric sm , the one - loop @xmath5 and @xmath6 gauge couplings already unify at a scale @xmath7  gev ( see figure  [ fig : g1 ] ) , which is close to the unification scale predicted by the string theory . in this case",
    ", gauge coupling unification could be achieved for a hypercharge normalization @xmath8  @xcite . however , if two - loop effects are taken into account , the above scale should be at most @xmath9  gev  @xcite , which is one order of magnitude smaller than the expected string scale . for high - scale supersymmetry breaking",

    "gauge group @xmath15 and its generations can be easily incorporated .",
    "string theory also offers an elegant explanation for the doublet - triplet splitting problem  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the unification of gauge couplings and gravity is an intrinsic property of heterotic string theory .",
    "remarkably , unification of couplings is a prediction of string theories even without any grand unified theory ( gut ) below the planck scale .",
    "indeed , gauge and gravitational couplings unify at tree level as  @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the string - scale unification coupling constant , @xmath18 is the newton constant , @xmath19 is the regge slope , @xmath20 are the gauge couplings and @xmath21 are the so - called affine or ka - moody levels at which the group factors @xmath12 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are realized in the four - dimensional string . the appearance of non - standard affine levels @xmath21 plays an important role in string theories .",
    "while the non - abelian factors @xmath24 and @xmath25 should be positive integers , the abelian factor @xmath26 can take a priori any arbitrary value , only constrained to be @xmath27 for the right - handed electron to have a consistent hypercharge assignment .",
    "furthermore , these factors determine the value of the mixing angle @xmath28 at the string scale .",
    "it may be possible that the string compactifies in four dimensions not to the sm group , but to a simple group which acts as a unified group . in this case @xmath29 and the ka - moody levels are fixed by the group structure , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a generator of the subgroup @xmath32 properly normalized over a representation @xmath33 of the string - gut group and @xmath34 is the same generator but normalized over the representation of the subgroup embedded into @xmath33 @xcite . for illustration ,",

    "it has also been noted  @xcite that the unification scale in the strong coupling limit can be much lower than the perturbative result given by equation  ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "yet , it is not clear whether unification is a robust prediction in this case .",
    "next , using the current precision electroweak data , we study the problem of gauge coupling unification within string theory , with the aim to look for the minimal particle content which is necessary to add to the sm in order to achieve unification at the weakly coupled heterotic string scale @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the gauge coupling constants at one loop is governed by the renormalization group equations ( rge ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 and the @xmath44-function coefficients @xmath45 are given by @xmath46-\\frac{11}3\\,c_2(g_i)\\ , \\ ] ] for non - supersymmetric theories .",
    "the function @xmath47 is 1 for complex scalars , 2 for chiral fermions and 4 for vector - like fermions .",
    "the casimir group invariant for the adjoint representation , @xmath48 , is @xmath49 for @xmath50 groups and null for a @xmath51 group .",
    "the functions @xmath52 encode the group structure contributions as follows @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the dimension of the representation concerning the invariant subgroup @xmath32 and @xmath55 is the dynkin index which , in our convention , is @xmath56 for the fundamental representations of @xmath50 groups and @xmath57 for the @xmath58 group .",

    "thus , at the unification scale @xmath64 , equation  ( [ eq : sol ] ) implies @xmath67 with the additional constraint @xmath68 which reflects the stringy nature of the unification .",

    "the top quark pole mass @xmath79 is taken as  @xcite @xmath80 and the higgs vacuum expectation value @xmath81  gev .",
    "using the sm coefficients @xmath45 given in equation  ( [ bsm ] ) and assuming @xmath82 , we obtain from equation  ( [ lambda_sm ] ) , @xmath83  gev , which in turn implies @xmath84 . substituting these values into equation  ( [ eq : sol1 ] ) we find @xmath85 , a value which is clearly outside the experimental range given in equation  ( [ n : mz ] ) .",
    "the above result already indicates that the string - scale unification of gauge couplings requires either non - perturbative ( or higher - order perturbative ) string effects to lower the unification scale or extra matter particles to modify the rge evolution of the gauge couplings .",
    "it is precisely the second possibility that we will consider here .    anticipating a possible string - gut compactification scenario",
    ", we shall restrict our analysis to the inclusion of fermions in real irreducible representations .",
    "the addition of chiral fermions leads in general to anomalies and their masses are associated to the electroweak symmetry breaking , which imposes further constraints .",
    "also , the introduction of new light scalars requires additional fine - tunings .",

    "the new - physics threshold @xmath96 can be significantly altered by such corrections .",
    "in particular , we notice that while at one loop the solutions @xmath107 and @xmath108 require an intermediate scale of the order of @xmath109  gev , this scale is lowered to @xmath110  gev at two - loop order .",
    "one may ask whether such an intermediate mass scale could be naturally generated . in principle , it might be due to the possible presence of nonrenormalizable higher - order operators or could be associated with an approximate global symmetry , such as a chiral symmetry of peccei - quinn type .    we have also searched for minimal solutions where the new matter states have a mass scale below the tev scale .",
    "seven solutions were found , which are listed in table  [ tab3 ] .",
