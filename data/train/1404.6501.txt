    "the closest stars to the sun have played a central role in studies of stellar astrophysics , as well as appealing to the imagination of the general public @xcite . over the last century , wide - field imaging surveys have been conducted at progressively fainter magnitudes and longer wavelengths , enabling the detection of the sun s neighbors down to the hydrogen burning limit ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "one of the most recent surveys was performed by the _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which obtained mid - infrared ( ir ) images of the entire sky .",
    "those data have proven to be highly effective at uncovering the coldest brown dwarfs in the vicinity of the sun @xcite .    most of the brown dwarfs found with _",
    "wise _ have been selected based on their colors .",
    "however , nearby brown dwarfs also can be identified through their large proper motions , which avoids photometric selection biases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this method has been successfully applied to the _ wise _ astrometry by measuring motions relative to near - ir surveys @xcite and within the multiple epochs from _ wise _ @xcite .",
    "the latter data are especially well - suited for finding nearby objects that are too cold to be detected in near - ir surveys . in this letter ,",
    "i characterize an object of this kind from my proper motion survey in @xcite , demonstrating that it is one of the sun s closest neighbors and the coldest known brown dwarf .",
    "between 2010 january 7 and 2011 february 1 , _ wise _ performed an all - sky imaging survey in bands centered at 3.4 , 4.6 , 12 , and 22  , which are denoted as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , respectively @xcite .",
    "because of the successive depletion of the two cryogen tanks , images were collected through only w1/w2/w3 and w1/w2 after 2010 august 6 and 2010 september 29 , respectively .",
    "each position in the sky was observed @xmath12 times over a period of @xmath13  day at intervals of six months . by the end of the 13 month survey , the images for a given location spanned either 6 or 12 months .    in @xcite",
    ", i found that wise j085510.83@xmath0071442.5 ( hereafter wise  0855@xmath00714 ) moved @xmath14 between two epochs of _ wise _ images that are separated by six months , which indicates a proper motion that is unusually high among known stars .",
    "the _ wise _ data for this object were obtained on 2010 may 4 and 2010 november 11 and consisted of 14 and 13 detections , respectively .",
    "it has a color of @xmath15 in the _ wise _ all - sky source catalog , which implies a spectral type of t6t8 @xcite . among the publicly available images that encompass wise  0855@xmath00714 , the data at @xmath16 and @xmath17 from the visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) hemisphere survey ( pi .",
    "mcmahon , i d 179.a-2010 ) provide the best constraints on its nature .",
    "these images are found in the first public data release for that survey in the vista science archive .",
    "the vista observations were performed on the night of 2010 march 9 , which was only two months prior to the first epoch of _ wise _ images for wise  0855@xmath00714 . as a result ,",
    "its expected position in the vista images is well - constrained .",
    "an object is not detected at that location in the @xmath16 and @xmath17 data from vista , which are shown in figure  [ fig : image ] for a @xmath18 area that encompasses wise  0855@xmath00714 . using the vista catalog of sources in the vicinity of wise",
    "0855@xmath00714 , i estimate that a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of 3 corresponds to @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the resulting color of @xmath21 is much redder than the values of 2.54 that are exhibited by t6t8 dwarfs , and instead is indicative of a y dwarf @xcite .    to investigate the discrepancies in the spectral types implied by @xmath22 and @xmath23",
    ", i examined the _ wise _ images of wise  0855@xmath00714 .",
    "i retrieved the single exposure images from the nasa / ipac infrared science archive , and coadded all images at a given filter for each of the two epochs .",
    "the resulting images at @xmath8 and @xmath9 are shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "the mean coordinates of wise  0855@xmath00714 from the single exposure catalogs in each epoch agree with the positions of the @xmath9 source in the coadded images , but each epoch s source in @xmath8 is near the midpoint between those coordinates . in other words ,",
    "the @xmath9 source shows significant movement between epochs while the @xmath8 source does not .",
    "the position of wise  0855@xmath00714 in @xmath8 is roughly midway between two objects that are near the detection limit in the vista @xmath17 image and are separated by 4@xmath24 .",
    "based on these _ wise _ and vista data , i concluded that wise  0855@xmath00714 is probably a blend of a moving object that dominates at @xmath9 and two stationary sources that dominate at @xmath8 , which would explain why @xmath22 implies an earlier spectral type than @xmath23 .",
    "this scenario is confirmed by the _",
    "observations described in section  [ sec : irac ] .",
    "it is unclear which components of wise  0855@xmath00714 dominate in @xmath10 , which is available for the first epoch only .",
    "the _ wise _ all - sky source catalog contains a measurement of photometry for wise  0855@xmath00714 in @xmath11 , but no detection is apparent based on visual inspection of the coadded image .",
    "i pursued near - ir imaging of wise  0855@xmath00714 that is deeper than the data from vista to better constrain its motion and spectral type and to assess the feasibility of spectroscopy . among the standard near - ir filters ,",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath25 usually offer the best sensitivity to the coldest brown dwarfs ; the former was selected for these observations .",
    "the images were obtained with the gemini near - infrared imager ( niri ) at the gemini north telescope on the night of 2013 april 17 .",
    "the instrument contained a 1024@xmath261024 aladdin insb array and was operated with the f/6 camera , resulting in a plate scale of @xmath27  pixel@xmath2 and a field of view of @xmath28 .",
    "twenty - six dithered images of wise  0855@xmath00714 were collected , each with an exposure time of 1  min .",
    "the images of wise  0855@xmath00714 were flat fielded , corrected for distortion , registered , and combined .",
    "astrometry and photometry from vista were used to measure the world coordinate system ( wcs ) and flux calibration for the combined image .",

    "no counterpart to the moving component of wise  0855@xmath00714 is detected in the niri image ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : image ] ) .",
    "the two components detected by vista appear at the same positions in the niri image , confirming that they have negligible motion . using the calibrated photometry for sources in the niri image",
    ", i estimate that snr=3 corresponds to @xmath30 .      because it was likely to be a new member of the solar neighborhood based on its rapid motion in the _ wise _ images ,",
    "i included wise  0855@xmath00714 in a survey for common proper motion companions to nearby stars ( program 90095 ) with the _",

    "s infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "the images in june were collected through the 3.6 and 4.5  filters , which are denoted as [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] . because the primary purpose of the second observation was astrometry , only the [ 4.5 ]",
    "band was employed .",
    "five dithered images were obtained in each filter on a given date .",
    "the exposure times for the individual frames were 23.6 and 26.8  s for [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] , respectively .",
    "the irac data were reduced in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "the resulting images are shown in figure  [ fig : image ] .",
    "irac has detected two objects straddling the position of wise  0855@xmath00714 , which coincide with the pair of stationary sources detected by vista and niri . in the first and second irac epochs",
    ", the moving component of wise  0855@xmath00714 appears @xmath31 and @xmath32 west of its position in the second epoch of _ wise _ images , respectively .",
    "this object is fainter than the two stationary sources in [ 3.6 ] , but the opposite is true at [ 4.5 ] . given the similarities in the bandpasses of [ 3.6]/@xmath8 and [ 4.5]/@xmath9 , these relative irac fluxes confirm the suggestion from section  [ sec : wise ] that wise  0855@xmath00714 is dominated by a moving object in @xmath9 and two stationary objects in @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , because @xmath8 is fainter than [ 3.6 ] for t and y dwarfs @xcite , the dominance of the stationary objects at @xmath8 should be even greater than that in [ 3.6 ] .",
    "i measured photometry in [ 3.6 ] and [ 4.5 ] for the moving and stationary components of wise  0855@xmath00714 from the irac images using the methods from @xcite .",

    "filters produce photometric magnitudes that agree to within a few percent on average .",
    "therefore , i can estimate the @xmath9 photometry of the moving component of wise  0855@xmath00714 by subtracting the [ 4.5 ] photometry of the stationary objects from the @xmath9 measurement in the all - sky source catalog ( @xmath33 ) .",

    "0855@xmath00714 , i began by measuring pixel coordinates with the task _ starfind _ in iraf for all point sources in the reduced [ 4.5 ] image from each irac epoch and in the coadded @xmath9 image from each _ wise _ epoch for a @xmath36 field centered on wise  0855@xmath00714 .",
    "i used astrometry from the two micron all - sky survey ( 2mass , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for sources in each image to derive offsets in right ascension , declination , and rotation that align the wcs with the 2mass astrometric system . for each of the _",
    "wise _ images , the coordinates measured for wise  0855@xmath00714 apply to a blend of the moving object and the two stationary sources . to correct for the latter",
    ", i added an artificial star with the flux of the moving component to one of the irac [ 4.5 ] images at a location near the coordinates measured from a given _ wise _ epoch , smoothed the resulting image to the resolution of _ wise _ , and measured astrometry for the blended source .",
    "this process was repeated for artificial stars at different locations until the astrometry of the blend agreed with the _ wise _ position .",
    "i then adopted the true coordinates of the artificial star for that best fit , which was equivalent to adding @xmath37 and @xmath38 to the right ascensions measured from the first and second epochs of _ wise _ images , respectively .",
    "no corrections to the declinations were necessary . to estimate the errors in the astrometry , i computed the standard deviations of the differences in right ascension and declination between the two irac epochs and between each _ wise _ epoch and 2mass for sources that have fluxes roughly similar to that of wise  0855@xmath00714 .",
    "the implied errors for the _ wise _ data are @xmath39 , but i have adopted @xmath40 in an attempt to account for the additional errors introduced by the blending . the astrometric data for the moving component of wise  0855@xmath00714 from _ wise _ and irac are listed in table  [ tab : astro ] .",
    "the coordinates of the stationary components in the irac images are included as well . the designation ",
    "wise  0855@xmath00714 \" refers to the moving object alone in the remainder of this study .",
    "i applied least - squares fitting of proper and parallactic motion to the astrometry for wise  0855@xmath00714 with the idl program mpfit .",
    "the reduced @xmath41 for the fit is less than unity ( 0.3 ) , indicating that the adopted astrometric errors may be overestimated . to check the errors produced by the fitting",
    ", i created 1000 sets of astrometry by adding gaussian noise to the measured values , and fitted parallactic and proper motion to each set .",
    "the resulting standard deviations of proper motion and parallax were similar to the errors from mpfit .",
