    "detailed discussions on the limitations of existing transport models can be found elsewhere.@xcite in short , even for one of the simplest systems , i.e. that of alkyl chains between au electrodes , there is a large discrepancy between the average tunnel barrier height , extracted from current - voltage ( @xmath1 ) measurements ( @xmath2{ev}$ ] ) , @xcite and the barrier that is expected from the experimentally determined electrode work function and alkyl monolayer ionization potential , i.e. the energy difference between the fermi level and highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) as found by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy , ups ( @xmath3{ev}$]).@xcite in spite of this apparent discrepancy , homo - dominated transport is the prevailing concept for such junctions . @xcite in the present study we challenge this concept and find that transport is dominated by the energy difference between the fermi level and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) of the molecules .",
    "it would seem that having a semiconductor ( sc ) instead of a metal as one of the electrodes in a molecular junction increases the difficulty in understanding the mechanisms that govern charge transport through the junction .",
    "indeed , with moderately doped scs , the sc depletion layer has a large effect on the overall observed current and if the band bending is very large , it completely overwhelms any molecular effect.@xcite as we shall see , though , the intrinsic asymmetry of a junction with a sc , with respect to charge carrier type , provides unique information on the energy levels involved in transport , _ in ways that are impossible when using only metal electrodes_.    to find how charge is transported through a monolayer of saturated alkyl chains we measure and analyze electrical transport across heavy - doped semiconductor - molecular insulator / metal junctions .",
    "our results provide unequivocal evidence that charge transport in these junctions is controlled by the energy difference between the metal fermi level and the lumo of the molecule , @xmath4 , rather than by the energy difference with the homo , @xmath5 .",

    "as long as the metal fermi level does not align with the sc forbidden energy gap ( i.e. , regions a , c ) transport is completely equivalent to tunneling in the more common metal - insulator - metal ( mim ) tunnel junction .",
    "@xcite in regions a and c , the bias acts to reduce the averaged tunneling barrier by @xmath29 . with a moderate negative voltage to the metal ( fig .",
    "[ esaki ] ) the metal fermi level moves to energies that are in the forbidden band gap of the sc .",
    "for such a case , neglecting interface states - assisted tunneling ( isat ) , esaki and stiles predicted an effective increase in the tunnel barrier height @xmath30 ( i.e. , @xmath30 ( b ) @xmath31 ( a , c ) ) , and ndr , as has indeed been observed experimentally.@xcite if isat is not neglected , instead of ndr a @xmath32 plot will show undulating behaviour ( as we show in fig .",
    "[ esaki ] , voltage range ( b ) , for molecular junctions ) , which is strongly influenced by the interface state density and distribution in the band gap .",
    "@xcite in our case isat has a clear influence on the @xmath21 data and , therefore , we observe undulating @xmath21 behaviour , instead of pure ndr .",
    "undulating @xmath21 occurs because in region b the highest energy electrons have no matching states to tunnel into , and transport proceeds via deeper electrons , aligned with the sc vb . for those electrons the barrier is now increasing as @xmath33 instead of decreasing with @xmath34 , as in band - to - band tunneling ( ranges a , c ) .",
    "in contrast to p@xmath0 junctions , n@xmath0 junctions are not predicted to show undulating @xmath21 plots for lumo - dominated tunneling because the sc fermi and the tunneling levels are on the same side of the forbidden sc gap , regardless of applied bias ( see fig .",
    "s3.1b of suppl . inf . ) .",
    "simply put , undulating @xmath21 is predicted to occur if tunneling proceeds via carriers of opposite type to the sc majority carriers .",
    "this prediction is confirmed experimentally in fig .",
    "[ normcond ] , which shows a highly symmetrical @xmath35 curve for the n@xmath0-si junction .",
    "if the @xmath5 energy difference did determine the transport barrier ( i.e. , hole , rather than electron tunneling ) , then the special undulating @xmath21 behaviour should be observed in the n@xmath0 junction for positive applied bias on the metal and the p@xmath0 junction should not present such behaviour at all .",
    "the reason for the latter is that for a p@xmath0-sc - based junction and hole tunneling ,    * with negative bias applied to the metal , holes tunnel from the sc valence band to the metal ; * with positive bias applied to the metal , holes tunnel from the metal to the sc valence band .",
    "neither of these flows involves tunneling of holes into the sc band gap .",
    "thus , the undulating @xmath36 behaviour ( fig .  2 ) and the approximately constant conductance ( fig .  [ normcond ] ) for the p@xmath0-si - alkyl / hg junction and lack of it in the n@xmath0 one ( fig .  [ normcond ] ) provide direct evidence for @xmath4 ( or electron)- , rather than @xmath5 ( hole)-dominated transport in both doping types . to put this in other words , if transport were homo - dominated , then the tunneling level and the sc fermi level would be below and above the n@xmath0-sc gap ( at positive bias ) , while both the homo and the sc fermi level would be always below the sc gap for p@xmath0 junctions . thus , tunneling via homo predicts undulating @xmath21 for n@xmath0 junctions , which is not observed experimentally ( cf .",
    "fig .  in the suppl . inf . for energy schemes that illustrate these alternatives ) . we note that , for an mim junction , this type of asymmetry can not be observed , because it originates in variation in available density of states for tunneling .",
    "indeed , scott et al have used this exact asymmetry and demonstrated that inelastic tunneling is much more pronounced in a metal / molecule - p@xmath0si junction than in a metal - molecule - metal junction @xcite        the conclusion that transport is dominated by the @xmath4 energy difference implies that the lumo is closer in energy to the sc @xmath22 for both doping types .",
    "this can be verified by characterizing the energetics of the molecularly modified si , prior to metal contact deposition . to this end",
    "we use _ ultra - violet photoemission spectroscopy _ ( ups ) , _ inverse photoemission spectroscopy _",
    "( ipes ) , _ x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy _ ( xps ) and _ contact potential difference _ ( cpd )",
    "we then study the si band bending at equilibrium after top metal deposition by measuring charge transport across molecular monolayers ( si - c@xmath37h@xmath38/hg ) that are so thin that they do not present an effective tunneling barrier .",
    "finally , we perform a molecular monolayer length - dependent study of sic@xmath6c@xmath7/hg junctions where n=14 , 16 and 18 .",
    "these monolayers are thick enough to make tunneling the dominant current transport process . from this length dependence study",
    "we extract the tunneling barrier height and compare it to the barrier that is expected from the ups / ipes results .",
    "we begin with determining the band bending ( bb ) in si in the p@xmath0- and n@xmath0-si - c@xmath11h@xmath12 systems .",
    "the position of the fermi level is known in our system from frequently repeated ups and ipes measurements of the fermi step on atomically clean metal ( e.g. au ) surfaces .",
    "given the nearly @xmath39{\\aa}$ ] thickness of the sam layer , the si valence band maximum ( vbm ) and conduction band minimum ( cbm ) are not visible in ups and ipes , and we must use here the xps measurement of the position of the si 2p core level , which is clearly detectable through the sam layer , to evaluate the vbm position and the bb . indeed , the energy difference between the core level and the vbm , called here ( si2p - vbm ) is fixed , and we can use the position of either one to determine that of the other .",
    "combined ups / xps measurements done in our laboratory on carefully prepared hydrogen - terminated si surfaces give ( si2p - vbm)@xmath40{ev}$ ] , and we use this value here for the determination of the bb .",
    "note that , in spite of being obtained with different experimental systems on differently prepared surfaces , this value compares well with that published in the literature.@xcite the si 2p peaks are found at @xmath41{ev}$ ] and @xmath42{ev}$ ] below the fermi level for the p@xmath0- and n@xmath0-si- c@xmath11h@xmath12 surfaces , respectively .",
    "thus , simple considerations give : @xmath43{ev } - \\unit[98.8]{ev } = \\unit[0.2]{ev } \\\\ \\mathrm{bb_{n - si } } & = & e_{\\mathrm{gap } } - ( e_\\mathrm{f } - \\mathrm{vbm } ) \\\\ & = & \\unit[1.1]{ev } - ( \\unit[99.8]{ev } - \\unit[98.9]{ev } ) = \\unit[0.2]{ev}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    both p-@xmath0 and n@xmath0-si surfaces are therefore seen to be slightly depleted with bb@xmath44{ev}$ ] .",
    "the small bb on both types of substrate is consistent with the known ability of these alkyl monolayers to passivate si.@xcite the cbm in each case is obtained by adding the @xmath45{ev}$ ] si band gap to the position of the vbm .    from the position of the photoemission onset of the he(i)(@xmath46{ev}$ ] )",
    "ups spectra , we find that the work functions of p@xmath0- and n@xmath0-si - c@xmath11h@xmath12 are @xmath47{ev}$ ] and @xmath48{ev}$ ] , respectively .",
    "similarly , the cpd measurements performed in the dark also yield a @xmath49{ev}$ ] difference between the two surfaces , in excellent agreement with the photoemission data .",
    "incidentally , cpd also shows these values to be independent of the number of carbons in the alkyl chain ( 2,14,16,18 ) for a given substrate ( i.e. p@xmath0- or n@xmath0-si).the difference between work functions of p@xmath0- and n@xmath0-si - c@xmath11h@xmath12 ( @xmath49{ev}$ ] ) is smaller than that expected from the difference in the si 2p core level positions for the two surfaces ( @xmath50{ev}$ ] ) .",
    "this may indicates that the si - c bond polarization , which contributes to the interface dipole , is affected by the position of the si fermi level .",
    "strictly speaking , the homo and lumo are concepts adapted from a single molecule gas phase model , while here we use them for a monolayer in close contact with a substrate .",
    "therefore , in the remaining of the text , we refer to them as hoso and luso , highest occupied and lowest unoccupied system orbital , @xcite similar to homo * and lumo * in ref .  .",

    "we define the edges of the monolayer band gap as the crossing between the tangent lines of the spectra . while the edge of the ups spectrum is defined clearly ( both for p@xmath0 and n@xmath0 ) , from the ipes spectra , two different edges can be defined .",
    "the reason is that the ipes incident electrons have a larger penetration depth than the escape depth of the ups electrons . as a result",
    ", the interface states are more pronounced in the ipes spectrum than in the ups spectrum .",
    "these states , which result from hybridization between the alkyl molecular states and the si vb and cb states at the interface are known as induced density of interface states ( idis ) and were calculated to be localized in the first three carbons of the alkyl chain ( with respect to the si surface).@xcite idis is probably the main physical origin for the onset of the intensity in the ipes spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ upsipes ] ) . as a result",
    ", the ipes spectrum has a `` two slope '' behavior , noted as # 1 and # 2 in fig .",
    "[ upsipes ] for both the p@xmath0 and n@xmath0 samples .",
    "we view slope # 1 as expressing the idis and slope # 2 originating from the actual luso .",
    "we note that experimentally determined edges of the gap do not necessarily correspond exactly to the hoso and luso of the monolayer .",
    "the onsets of ups and ipes intensity , which define the gap edges , can be affected by spectral broadening , due to polarization of the molecules in the dense monolayer , @xcite by idis , @xcite and by radiation damage.@xcite the hoso and luso positions can be found by fitting the calculated density of states results , as reported by segev et al . for the si - c@xmath6h@xmath7 system @xcite to the experiment .",
    "in their calculations segev et al . , identified the actual luso to be @xmath52{ev}$ ] above the edge , defined by slope # 2 .",
    "the actual hoso was identified to be @xmath53{ev}$ ] below the ups edge .",
    "the main implication of this calculation for the present study is that , while there is some experimental uncertainty regarding the actual position of the hoso , the luso and band gap width , this uncertainty is unidirectional ( i.e. , the experimental edge to edge gap is the lower limit of the actual gap ) and a similar situation holds for both ups ( hoso ) and ipes ( luso ) .    figures  [ upsipes]b and c clearly show that for both p@xmath0 and n@xmath0 samples , the fermi level is closer to the onset of the ipes spectrum ( luso ) than to the onset of the ups spectrum ( hoso ) and the estimated uncertainty of the exact position of the hoso and luso is marked by a shaded area .",
    "the apparent difference in the edge to edge gap in fig.[upsipes ] for the molecular monolayers on p@xmath0 and n@xmath0 , is within this uncertainty . for p@xmath0-si - c@xmath11h@xmath12 samples ,",

    "similarly , for the n@xmath0-si - c@xmath11h@xmath12 samples , the energy difference between the si @xmath22 and the monolayer luso ( @xmath56{ev}$ ] ) is smaller than that between the si @xmath22 and the hoso ( @xmath57{ev}$ ] ) .    a prominent feature in fig .  [ upsipes ]",
    "is that the intrinsic band alignment somewhat varies with the doping density of si . in other words ,",
    "the energy difference between the luso ( hoso ) and the conduction ( valence ) band edges of the si is not constant and shifts with the position of the fermi level within the si band gap .",
    "this result is surprising , because it is normally assumed that the electronic molecular properties ( ionization potential and electron affinity ) are independent of the properties of the substrate .",
    "still , this result is highly reproducible experimentally and the same phenomenon was also observed in other hybrid organic - inorganic systems.@xcite possibly this is related to the above - hypothesised doping - dependent si - c bond polarization .",
    "regardless of this result , which is currently under further study , the key experimental finding is that , for both p@xmath0 and n@xmath0 si systems , the fermi level of the system and the carrier transport level in the si are significantly closer to the luso than to the hoso .",
    "we now ask if the spectroscopic results presented in fig .  [ upsipes ] can efficiently predict the charge transport characteristics of the alkyl chain monolayer ? to answer this , we compare the effective tunneling barrier height that we can deduce from the @xmath21 measurements with the expected barrier that we find from the ipes spectrum i.e. @xmath58 energy difference . to this end",
    "we need to take under consideration the si band bending in the junction at equilibrium ( zero bias ) , rather than the band bending at the si surface as determined by xps for the free molecularly- modified si surface , because that band bending can change after forming a metal ( hg ) contact on the molecules .",
    "because the molecular monolayer is very thin ( @xmath59{\\aa}$ ] ) and supports a large tunneling current , there can be charge transfer between the metal and the si substrate across the molecules , until electronic equilibrium is established ( equalization of the fermi levels of the si and the metal ) .",
    "this charge transfer affects the si band bending , but should not change the alignment between the si bands ( at the surface ) and the monolayer hoso and luso , assuming that the molecules do not become charged .",
    "elsewhere we showed @xcite that , due do the large surface dipole that is introduced by the molecules , depositing hg on a moderately doped n - si - c@xmath6h@xmath7 sample results in a large band bending in the si , up to the point where the si surface is in strong inversion and charge transport in the junction is controlled by minority carrier recombination .",
    "for the heavy - doped si used here , the effect of the band bending on transport is usually much smaller , because the depletion layer is thinner ( @xmath60{nm}$ ] compared to @xmath61{\\upmu m}$ ] for moderately doped si ) and allows some charge tunneling through it .",

    "[ upsipes ] .",
    "the average extracted @xmath83 in the low bias range ( @xmath84{v}$ ] ) of the @xmath21 curves in fig .",
    "[ jvlong ] is @xmath85{\\aa^{-1}}$ ] . inserting this value into eq .",
    "[ 2 ] , along with a @xmath82 effective mass,@xcite yields a @xmath86{ev}$ ] barrier .",
    "having established that @xmath58 dominates charge transport ( fig .  [ normcond ] ) , we can locate the extracted @xmath83 value on the ipes spectrum ( marked by vertical arrow ) in fig .",
    "[ upsipes ] .",
    "this value is in between the ipes edges and , because it is only the lower limit of the barrier , we conclude that we have reasonable agreement with the luso of the alkyl monolayer ( edge # 2 in fig .",
    "[ upsipes ] ) .",
    "a tunneling barrier of @xmath87{ev}$ ] is much smaller than the @xmath88 difference of @xmath89{ev}$ ] ( fig .  [ upsipes ] ) , decreasing further the possibility of significant hoso - contribution to transport .",
    "the natural question is how far our observation for luso - dominated tunneling in alkyl - si junctions is applicable to alkyl junctions on any substrate ?",
    "the answer depends on the position of the molecular levels of the alkyl chains relative to the electrode fermi level .",
    "ups / ipes measurements of alkyl thiols on au @xcite yield a hoso - luso gap of @xmath90{ev}$ ] and significantly smaller @xmath58 ( @xmath91{ev}$ ] ) than @xmath88 ( @xmath92{ev}$ ] ) ( the latter is in good agreement with previously reported @xmath88 for alkyl thiols on au ( @xmath3{ev}$ ] ) .",
    "@xcite the hoso - luso gap is similar to the gap measured for alkyl chain monolayers on both si @xcite and gaas @xcite with different binding groups ( si - c , si - o - c and gaas - po@xmath93-c ) , i.e. , _ it is not influenced significantly by binding group and substrate type_. the range of the edge - to - edge gap in all examined samples is @xmath94{ev}$ ] , if the idis onset is ignored .",
    "these values agree with values reported for polyethylene.@xcite thus we conclude that the hoso - luso gap of alkyl monolayers , and their position relative to the vacuum level is rather independent of the contacting electrodes .",
    "therefore , we expect tunneling to be dominated by the @xmath58 energy difference for any alkyl junctions , except maybe for electrodes of extremely high work function ( @xmath95{ev}$ ] ) .",
    "our conclusion is at odds with earlier studies on molecular transport across alkyl chains , which concluded that transport is dominated by the @xmath88 barrier , especially for the extensively studied au-(alkythiol or alkyldithiol)-au systems.@xcite in most cases the evidence for hole tunneling is based on transport across relatively short alkyl chains , up to c12 , and is indirect . an exception is the measurement of thermo - power ( seebeck coefficient ) , where the positive coefficient was taken as direct evidence for hole / hoso - mediated tunneling .",
    "@xcite remarkably , though , the thermo - power decreases with increasing molecular length and , when extrapolated , is predicted _ to change sign _",
    "( i.e. , change from hoso- to luso - dominated , hole to electron tunneling ) for alkyl chains longer than c12 .",
    "this length - dependence was rationalized by invoking metal induced gap states ( migs ) as dominating transport , rather than pure molecular states .",
    "such an explanation is very reasonable , because with the short dithiol molecules used in those experiments ( au - sc@xmath6h@xmath7s - au with @xmath96 ) migs are expected to extend out to several carbon atoms from the contacts .    in early cp - afm work on short",
    "mono and dithiol alkyl chains the extrapolated zero molecular length resistance increased as the work function of the contacting metal decreased and this was taken to indicate an increasing tunnel barrier.@xcite similar to the thermo - power , this effect can be due to the migs , rather than to alkyl - derived energy levels .    in earlier work with si as substrate ,",
    "the type of dominant charge carrier in the semiconductor was suggested to dictate the type of tunneling through ( longer ) alkyl chains.@xcite in later work on a system , similar to the one studied here , the lack of temperature activation was taken as indicating hoso - mediated /electron tunneling @xcite , an effect that may well be present , but is overwhelmed by the effects that we have shown here . except for the last two reports , we note",
    "that the main difference between ours and other experiments is that si - monolayer / hg junctions ( with a several @xmath97{\\upmu m}$ ] diameter contact , rather than a nm - sized one ) make it possible to measure conductance through longer molecules , which allows measuring molecule- , rather than contact - dominated transport by reducing the contribution of migs and idis interface effects to net transport .",
    "to conclude , the analogy to asymmetry in ndr for degenerately - doped mis of different doping types indicates that for both p@xmath0- and n@xmath0-type si - alkyl chain / hg junctions charge transport is controlled by @xmath58 ( rather than by @xmath88 ) .",
    "furthermore , by comparing charge transport through p@xmath0- and n@xmath0-si - c2h5/hg junctions , we showed that there is considerable band bending in the n@xmath0-si junction , which has a large effect on the charge transport ( even though the si is heavy doped ) .",
    "the p@xmath0-si junction , though , is near flat - band in equilibrium , with comparable transport probability to that of mim junctions .",
    "using ups and ipes measurements we elucidated the electronic structure of si - alkyl system and showed that @xmath98 , in line with the electron tunneling qualitative argument . the tunneling barrier height",
    "estimated from the wkb approximation also fits well with the ipes - derived @xmath58 difference .",
