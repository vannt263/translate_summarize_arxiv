    "note that since @xmath195 , ( [ 4.1 ] ) automatically leads to the ansatz ( [ 1.7 ] ) with @xmath83 [ because we have not taken into account in ( [ 2.6 ] ) `` slight '' hard - core changes of the correlation functions @xmath119 defined by ( [ 2.5 ] ) ] .",

    "the @xmath93th term in the sum on the rhs of ( [ 4.1 ] ) has the correct behavior in the limit @xmath34 : it goes to 0 when @xmath198 and removes the singularity of @xmath117 at @xmath191 ( and simultaneously gives rise to a logarithmic dependence on the hard core at this point ) .",
