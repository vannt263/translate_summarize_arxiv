    "is mollified by inclusion of regularizing effects .",
    "it may be expected that if 3-d ns solutions exhibited blow up , then actual fluid flow , on very small time and space scales , has to involve parameters other than those considered in ns .",

    "such an estimate , which also follows directly from leray s observation on the cumulative dissipation being bounded , is worked out in the appendix .",
