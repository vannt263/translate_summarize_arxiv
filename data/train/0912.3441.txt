    "the problem of determining fundamental limits on the performance of mobile and ad hoc networks continues to attract the interest of researchers .",
    "several important results have been achieved with the seminal papers by gupta and kumar  @xcite ( which provided the first capacity bounds in static wireless networks ) and by grossglauser and tse  @xcite ( which showed that the mobility can increase the capacity of an ad  hoc network ) .",
    "various mobility models have been studied in the literature , and the delay - capacity relationships under those models have been characterized ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the nature of these trade - offs is strongly influenced by the choice of the mobility model  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there has been an increased interest in mobile ad hoc networks where end - to - end multi - hop paths may not exist and communication routes may only be available through time and mobility ; depending on the context , these networks are now commonly referred as intermittently connected networks ( icns ) or delay tolerant networks ( dtns ) . although limited , the understanding of the fundamental properties of such networks is steadily increasing .",
    "there is a significant number of results focusing on characterizing the packet propagation delay  @xcite , assuming that packet transmissions are instantaneous , and more recently , the information propagation speed  @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite took a graph - theoretical approach in order to upper bound the time it takes for disconnected mobile networks to become connected through the mobility of the nodes .",
    "the papers  @xcite analyze the delay of common routing schemes , such as epidemic routing , under the assumption that the inter - meeting time between pairs of nodes follows an exponential distribution .",
    "however , this assumption is not generally verified , depending on the relationship between the size of the network domain and the relevant time - scale of the network scenario under consideration  @xcite , and this can result in either an over - estimation or an under - estimation of the actual system performance  @xcite .",
    "departing from the exponential inter - meeting time hypothesis , in  @xcite , kong and yeh studied the information dissemination latency in large wireless and mobile networks , in constrained i.i.d .",
    "mobility and brownian motion models .",
    "they showed that , when the network is not percolated , the latency scales linearly with the euclidean distance between the sender and the receiver .",
    "the first analytical estimates of the constant upper bounds on the speed at which information can propagate in dtns , again without considering the quantity of information that can be transmitted , were obtained in  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , in this paper , we investigate the space - time capacity of such networks , the maximum amount of information that can be transferred from a source to a destination over time . as the network",
    "is almost surely disconnected , we refer to journeys rather than paths , where a journey is an alternation of data transmissions and carriages using store - carry - forward routing .",
    "informally , our objective is to determine how fast a given amount of data @xmath0 can reach its destination . formally , we use a probabilistic model of space - time journeys of packets of information in dtns ( in section  [ sect : model ] ) , and define the journey capacity as well as the information propagation speed ( in section  [ sect : thickness ] ) , to provide the following main contributions :    * we characterize the duration of node meetings , by bounding the probability function of the durations of the nodes encounters , in section  [ sect : meetings ] ; * we prove the first non trivial lower bounds on the information propagation speed ( theorem  [ theo : lower ] ) , for a bounded journey capacity , in random waypoint - like mobility , in section  [ sect : lower ] ; * we prove general upper bounds on the information propagation speed ( theorem  [ theo : upper ] and corollaries  1 and  2 ) , as a function of the journey capacity , and we investigate the properties of journeys that maximize the space - time network capacity in bit - meters per second , in section  [ sect : upper ] ; * we compare and verify the analytical bounds with simulation measurements in section  [ sect : simulations ] .",
    "we provide concluding remarks in section  [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "we consider a network of @xmath1 nodes in a square area of size @xmath2 and radio range @xmath3 . as we want to focus on dtns that are almost surely disconnected",
    ", we will analyze the case where @xmath3 is fixed , while @xmath4 , such that the node density @xmath5 is bounded by some constant .",
    "formally , we adopt the random geometric graph model  @xcite : two nodes at distance smaller than a maximum radio range @xmath3 can exchange information . moreover , we consider that the rate at which nodes can transmit data when they are within range is fixed , and equals @xmath6 units of data per second .    initially , the nodes are distributed uniformly at random .",
    "every node follows an i.i.d .",
    "random trajectory , reflected on the borders of the square ( like billiard balls ) .",
    "the nodes change direction at poisson rate  @xmath7 and keep a constant speed @xmath8 between direction changes .",
    "the motion direction angles are uniformly distributed in @xmath9 and are mutually independent among all nodes .",
    "when @xmath10 , we have a _ pure billiard model _ ( nodes only change direction at the border ) .",
    "when @xmath11 , we have a _ random walk model _ ; when @xmath12 we are on the brownian limit . when @xmath13 we are on a _ random way - point - like model _ , since nodes travel a distance of order @xmath14 before changing direction or hitting the border .",
    "we study _ journeys with a given capacity _ , journeys that guarantee that at least an amount of data can be transferred to the destination .",
    "our aim is to find the shortest journey ( in time ) with journey capacity at least @xmath0 , that connects any source to any destination in the network domain , in order to derive the overall information propagation speed .",
    "we base our analysis on a probabilistic model of journeys of packets of information that encapsulates all possible shortest journeys originating at the source , as used in  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath15 be a simple journey ( a journey not returning to the same node twice ) .",
    "let @xmath16 be the terminal point .",

    "let @xmath18 be the probability of the journey @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath19 be an inverse space vector , with components expressed in inverse distance units .",
    "let @xmath20 be a scalar in inverse time units .",
    "we denote by @xmath21 the journey laplace transform , defined for a domain definition for @xmath22 : @xmath23    we call @xmath24 the normalized density of journeys starting from @xmath25 at time  0 , and arriving at  @xmath26 before time  @xmath27 :    @xmath28    - 0.42 cm    let us consider that a bundle of information of @xmath0 bits is generated at @xmath29 on a node at coordinate @xmath30 .",

    "we denote @xmath32 .",
    "let @xmath33 denote the probability that there exists a journey of capacity at least @xmath0 reaching the destination before time  @xmath27 .",
    "the _ information propagation speed _ @xmath34 , considering a journey capacity @xmath0 , is defined as the minimum ratio of distance over time above which the journey probability tends to @xmath35 ,    * if  @xmath36 , then @xmath37 ; * if  @xmath38 , then @xmath39 .",
    "we also define the _ space - time information propagation capacity _",
    "@xmath40 ( from now on simply referred to as the _ space - time capacity _ ) , as the maximal transport capacity in bit - meters per second , that can be achieved by any journey of capacity  @xmath0 .",
    "thus , in this model , the space - time capacity corresponds to the product @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , in order to determine the space - time capacity limits of mobile and delay tolerant networks , we will analyze the information propagation speed , as a function of the journey capacity ; in the following sections , we will compute lower and upper bounds . in order to derive the bounds",
    ", we first study the characteristics of node meetings .",
    "a meeting ( or encounter ) between two nodes occurs when their distance becomes smaller than or equal to @xmath3 , when the nodes come into communication range .",
    "a node @xmath42 , moving in direction @xmath43 , meets new nodes moving in direction between @xmath44 and @xmath45 at rate : @xmath46 , for @xmath47 $ ] , where @xmath3 is the radio range .",

    "the rate at which a node meets new neighbors is  @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , from the little formula , the average meeting time ( the time that a node remains a neighbor ) equals @xmath53 .",
    "the proof follows by applying markov s inequality .    in the pure billiard model ( when @xmath54 )",
    ", we can give the exact formulas on the meeting time distribution .",
    "we note that our model where nodes bounce on the borders like billiard balls is equivalent to considering an infinite area made of mirror images of the original network domain square : a mobile node moves in the original square while its mirror images move in the mirror squares  @xcite .",

    "when @xmath58 , the cumulative probability @xmath49 is : @xmath59 [ lem : distt ]    see appendix .",
    "we prove a lower bound @xmath60 on the information propagation speed , for journey capacity @xmath0 , in the random way - point - like mobility model , when nodes travel a distance of the order of the network domain length before changing direction .",
    "initially , we focus on the pure billiard mobility model , we assume that nodes do not change direction unless they hit the border . finally , we remark that the result can be generalized to node mobility with a small change of direction rate .",
    "we will show that , for all destination nodes which , at time @xmath27 , are at distance @xmath61 of the initial source location , there is a journey of duration @xmath27 and of capacity @xmath0 from the source to the destination , with probability strictly larger than  @xmath35 .",

    "this upper bound journey model results in a higher density of journeys than in the actual network .",
    "but , in this model , any journey can be decomposed into a sequence of independent segments .",
    "consequently , we can express a journey @xmath15 as an arbitrary sequence of emission _ or _ move - and - emit segments , using regular expression notation , @xmath151 .",

    "we denote the segment laplace transforms by @xmath152 and @xmath153 , for emission and move - and - emit segments , respectively .",
    "equivalently to the formal identity @xmath154 , which represents the laplace transform of an arbitrary sequence of random variables with laplace transform @xmath155 , the journey laplace transform has a denominator @xmath156 , equal to : @xmath157    we have the following laplace transform expressions :    * @xmath158 , where @xmath142 is uniform in the disk of radius @xmath3 , with density @xmath139 , @xmath159 . * @xmath160 , where @xmath142 is uniform on the circle of radius @xmath3 , with density @xmath139 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "the upper bound is the smallest ratio @xmath128 of the non - negative pair @xmath164 which is a root of the denominator  @xmath165 ( with @xmath166 ) , obtained by substituting the segment laplace transforms expressions in  ( [ eq : kernel ] ) .    in order to generalize to journeys of a given capacity @xmath167",
    ", we will restrict the set of possible journeys , to those satisfying the desired capacity constraint , and calculate the laplace transform of the journey density in this restricted set .",
    "first , we remark that , a journey has a capacity at least  @xmath0 , if and only if the journey _ thickness _ ( the minimum duration of all data transmissions in the journey ) is at least equal to  @xmath168 , with @xmath6 the communication rate .",
    "therefore , when considering journeys of a given capacity , we can equivalently focus on the possible journeys with minimum node meeting duration  @xmath168 .",
    "therefore , in the upper - bound journey model , we can substitute the probability of any emission segment with the probability of the same emission segment , while additionally ensuring that the emission duration is at least  @xmath168 .",

    "this direct substitution is feasible because we work with the upper bound journey model , where successive segments ( including all transmissions ) are independent of the previous network state .",
    "again , this results in considering a higher density of journeys than in the actual network ( including some transmissions which are not actually possible , due to the node directions ) ; however , there is no impact on the validity of our analysis , since we are interested in upper bounds .    to conclude the proof , it suffices to substitute quantity  @xmath170 using lemma  [ lem : distt ] when @xmath54 , and lemma  [ lem : meetingbound ] when  @xmath171 .",
    "we derive the following corollaries expressing the behavior of the upper bound when the journey capacity is large , in random waypoint - like ( @xmath172 ) and random walk / brownian motion mobility ( @xmath171 ) , respectively .",
    "when nodes move at speed @xmath118 , and @xmath173 ( the journey capacity @xmath0 is large ) with @xmath11 , the propagation speed upper bound is @xmath174 .",

    "we observe that , for large journey capacities  @xmath0 , the upper bound on the information propagation speed @xmath125 tends to the actual mobile node speed  @xmath8 in random way - point - like mobility , while it decreases with the inverse square root of the journey capacity  @xmath0 in random walk or brownian motion mobility . in both cases ,",
    "the resulting upper bound on the space - time capacity @xmath176 is a function which increases with  @xmath0 .",
    "when nodes move at speed @xmath118 in random way - point - like mobility :    * from theorem  [ theo : lower ] , a lower bound on the propagation speed is @xmath8 , for any bounded @xmath0 , and when the node density is @xmath177 ; * from corollary  [ cor : billiard ] , an upper bound on the propagation speed is @xmath8 , for journey capacities @xmath0 such that @xmath178 .",
