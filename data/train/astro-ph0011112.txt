    "we obtained @xmath16 imaging data for the chamaeleon i dark cloud and three relatively unreddened control fields on 1316 february 1995 , 811 march 1996 , 1619 april 1997 , and 12 november 1998 with cirim ( the cerro tololo infrared imager ) at the ctio 1.5 m telescope .",
    "the cirim uses a 256 @xmath20 256 hgcdte nicmos 3 array , which provides a field of @xmath0 4.9@xmath24 @xmath20 4.9@xmath24 with a plate scale of 1.16@xmath26 per pixel .",

    "cha i has a remarkable low - mass star formation activity localized mainly in three groups .",
    "these small clusters are situated near three reflection nebulae : ced 112 ( hd 97300 ) , ced 110 , and ced 111 ( hd 97048 ) , from north to south .",
    "our three control fields , covering an area of @xmath0 0.05 deg@xmath17 and selected from a visual inspection of the eso red sky survey prints , are close to the survey region and relatively free from significant optical extinction .",
    "these off - cloud regions lie outside the limits of figure 1 , @xmath0 1.52 deg away from the h@xmath27co boundaries , one to the north and the other two to the east and west , respectively .",
    "table 1 gives positions and total areas covered by each of the off - cloud regions .",
    "we processed the data using standard techniques with the software package iraf . from each program frame , we subtracted an average dark frame , divided by a normalized flat - field frame appropriate for each filter , and then subtracted a flattened sky frame .",
    "the dark frame is the average of @xmath0 40 individual dark images taken at the beginning and end of each night .",
    "we constructed flat - field frames for each night by median - filtering all 6 @xmath20 5 sec frames taken in each filter .",
    "we also obtained a set of `` dome flats '' in each filter before observing each night using an illuminated white spot in the ctio 1.5-m dome .",
    "flat - fields constructed from `` dome flats '' and `` sky flats '' were identical .",
    "sky frames were generated from a median - filtered set of 2030 flattened frames in each filter . in this case , we combined individual object frames obtained close in time and in position to the program frame .    to produce a combined image from each dithered pair of images , we aligned the frames using the iraf subroutines geomap and geotran , added the co - aligned frames together , and trimmed the resulting image to remove bad pixels at the edges of the frames .",
    "we selected the @xmath2 images as the reference frames and transformed the @xmath5 and @xmath4 images to the same pixel scale as the @xmath2 images .",
    "we used daofind to locate stars 4@xmath28 above the local background and added to the daofind list all stellar objects missed by this routine , found by visual inspection of each image .",

    "this aperture size includes the total flux for the large majority of sources .",
    "however , in some cases , we used a smaller aperture ( i.e. 2.5@xmath26 ) to avoid contamination from very close stars .",

    "we apply the color term to our @xmath7 data and thus quote colors in the cit system .",
    "to derive coordinates for our survey stars , we used wcstool @xcite , a suite of programs to calculate a direct transformation between the coordinates of the image ( x , y ) and the sky coordinates ( @xmath10,@xmath12 ) .",
    "we measured transformation coefficients adopting matches between program stars and stars in the u.s .",

    "these matches provided a good transformation for @xmath0 90% of the frames .",
    "for the rest of the frames , usually corresponding to the most obscured regions , we found few or no matches between our frames and stars in the catalog . in these cases , we used stars in common with adjacent frames with good coordinates to obtain coordinates for stars on unmatched frames .",
    "when an individual source was detected in more than one filter we adopted the average coordinate .    to verify the coordinates",
    ", we measured coordinate differences between stars on adjacent frames .",
    "many stars have two good coordinates ; others have as many as four .",
    "after visually inspecting the duplicate stars and rejecting stars too close to the edges of frames , we averaged coordinates of the remaining duplicates and derived 1@xmath28 errors . finally , we compared coordinates derived from the digitized sky survey ( dss ) plates .",
    "we estimate an average uncertainty in our positions of 1@xmath26 .",
    "these errors are as large as 2@xmath26 for sources in the most obscured regions of the cloud .",
    "having verified the quality of the coordinates and photometry for our survey , we search for pre - main sequence stars with near - infrared excess emission in the cloud using the near - infrared color - color diagram . to identify these stars , we derive a reliable extinction curve for background stars in  3 and then consider the near - infrared color - color diagram in  4 .",
    "to derive the near - infrared reddening law for the cha i dark cloud , we follow @xcite , who developed a generalized photometric technique to compare the colors of reddened stars with the colors of nearby , `` unreddened '' comparison stars .",
    "@xcite assume that the stellar population behind the cloud is identical to the stellar population in off - fields several degrees away .",
    "they derive the @xmath7 and @xmath8 color excesses for each on - cloud source relative to every off - cloud source and then compute the average and median color excesses for each on - cloud source .",
    "the probable error of the average color excess is the sum in quadrature of the errors of the on - cloud and off - cloud colors . for the median color excess ,",
    "the probable error is the inter - quartile range .",
    "we divide the cha i sources into a complete sample containing all stars with @xmath34 and a restricted sample , where we remove known young stars in the cloud from the complete sample .",
    "the sample of known young stars includes 94 sources ( lying on our survey region ) from the literature @xcite .",
    "this sample probably is not complete ; however , any incompleteness does not affect our analysis significantly .",

    "results derived for the complete sample demonstrate that pre - main sequence stars with near - infrared excesses skew the extinction law to smaller values ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "figure 3 shows many previously identified sources with apparent near - infrared excesses .",
    "these sources probably skew our results for the reddening law derived from the restricted sample , although this effect should be small .",

    "smaller values for @xmath57 produce noisy grids ; larger values are inconsistent with the photometric errors .",
    "figure 4 shows the color distribution functions for the off - field and the complete sample ( cs ) .",
    "the off - field density in the left panel has a weak maximum at the color expected for g - type giants and a sharp maximum at the color expected for k - type dwarfs .",

    "the cha i color distribution in the right panel peaks close to the off - field maximum but is much more extended .",
    "the long axis of the contours roughly follows the reddening line derived above , and there is a weak extension of sources with near - infrared excess emission at @xmath8 @xmath30 0.75 and @xmath7 @xmath30 1.75 .",

    "we distinguish two groups of sources in figure 6 : a ) stars that lie along or follow the reddening band direction , and b ) sources that show near - infrared excess , located to the right of the reddening band .",
    "the first group , comprising the majority of the sources , show negligible near - infrared color excess , and can be dereddened to lie close to the standard dwarf sequence .",
    "most of these sources are probably behind the cloud .",
    "the color excess of the second sample can not be attributed to the reddening by dusty material in the cloud .",
    "several authors have found that circumstellar material ( disks + infalling envelopes ) surrounding the young central star can produce these color excess at the near - infrared wavelengths @xcite . formally speaking we have detected sources lying to the right of the reddening band in our survey with roughly 1/3 are known members of the cloud and denis candidates from @xcite .",

    "for these faint sources , we checked each of the images visually to avoid possible confusion with cosmic ray events , bad pixels , plate artifacts , or contamination with close stars .",
    "a few of the objects listed in the table 3 and table 4 were only detected in two of the filters ( @xmath2 and @xmath4 ) and therefore @xmath5 must be @xmath9 18.0 .",
