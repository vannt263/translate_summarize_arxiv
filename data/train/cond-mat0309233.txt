    "this work has goals at two levels . at the immediate level ,",
    "its goal is to investigate the possibility of simple laws relating the flow of trading orders into a market to statistical properties of prices .",
    "the laws that we propose and investigate are not temporal predictions , but rather relations restricting the possible values that the underlying variables can take at any given point in time .",
    "the ideal gas law provides a simple physical analogy that illustrates both the limited scope and the potential utility of such laws . in our case ,",
    "the goal is to relate properties of the order flow , such as market order placement rate , limit order placement rate , and cancellation rate , to properties of the market such as the gap between the best prices for buying and selling , or the variability of prices .",
    "in addition , we present some results that are related to the nature of supply and demand functions .    at a broader level , this work is interesting because of the nature of the model we test , which makes the simple assumption that agents place orders to buy or sell at random @xcite .",
    "this is in constrast to standard models in economics , which typically devote considerable effort to modeling the strategic behavior and expectations of agents .",
    "no one would dispute that this is important .",
    "however , there may be some circumstances where other factors may be more important .",
    "for example , becker @xcite showed that a budget constraint is sufficient to guarantee the proper slope of supply and demand curves , and gode and sunder @xcite demonstrated that if one replaces the students in a standard classroom economics experiment by zero - intelligence agents , the zero - intelligence agents perform surprisingly well .",
    "the model we test here builds on earlier work in financial economics @xcite and physics @xcite .",
    "( see also interesting subseqent work @xcite ) .",
    "we show here that in some circumstances the zero - intelligence approach can make surprisingly good quantitative predictions .",
    "the model of daniels et al .",
    "@xcite assumes a continuous double auction , which is the most widely used method of price formation in modern financial markets @xcite .",
    "there are two fundamental kinds of trading orders : impatient traders submit _ market orders _ , which are requests to buy or sell a desired number of shares immediately at the best available price .",
    "more patient traders submit _ limit orders _ , which include the worst allowable price for the transaction .",
    "limit orders may fail to result in an immediate transaction , in which case they are stored in a queue called the _ limit order book _",
    ", illustrated in fig .",
    "[ orderschematic ] .",
    "as each buy order arrives it is transacted against accumulated sell limit orders that have a lower selling price , in priority of price and arrival time .",
    "similarly for sell orders .",
    "the lowest selling price offered in the book at any point in time is called the _",
    "best ask _ , @xmath0 , and the highest buying price the _ best bid _",
    ", @xmath1 .          the model that we test here",
    "@xcite assumes that two types of zero intelligence agents place and cancel orders randomly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ orderschematic ] .",
    "impatient agents place market orders of size @xmath2 , which arrive at a rate @xmath3 _ shares per time_. patient agents place limit orders of the same size @xmath2 , which arrive with a constant rate density @xmath4 _ shares per price per time_. these agents may be thought of as liquidity demanders and suppliers .",
    "queued limit orders are canceled at a constant rate @xmath5 , with dimensions of _ 1/time_. prices change in discrete increments called _ ticks _ , of size @xmath6 . to keep the model as simple as possible ,",
    "there are equal rates for buying and selling , and order placement and cancellation are poisson processes .",
    "all of these processes are independent except for coupling through their boundary conditions : buy limit orders arrive with a constant density @xmath4 over the semi - infinite interval @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the logarithm of the price , and sell limit orders arrive with constant density @xmath4 on the semi - infinite interval @xmath9 . as a result of the random order arrival processes , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "each make random walks , but because of coupling of the buying and selling processes the bid - ask _ spread _",
    "@xmath10 is a stationary random variable .",
    "as new orders arrive they may alter the best prices @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which in turn changes the boundary conditions for subsequent limit order placement .",
    "for example , the arrival of a buy limit order inside the spread will alter the best bid @xmath1 , which immediately alters the boundary condition for sell limit order placement .",
    "it is this feedback between order placement and price diffusion that makes this model interesting , and despite its apparent simplicity , quite difficult to understand analytically .",
    "this model has been analyzed using both simulation and two different mean field theories  @xcite .",
    "one of the virtues of this model is that it gives simple scaling laws relating the parameters of the model to fundamental properties such as the average bid - ask spread , and the price diffusion rate .",
    "the mean value of the spread predicted based on a mean field theory analysis of the model in the limit @xmath11 is @xmath12 the nondimensional ratio @xmath13 is the ratio of removal by cancellation to removal by market orders , and plays an important role in determining the properties of the model .",
    "@xmath14 is a relatively slowly varying , monotonically increasing non - dimensional function that can be approximated as @xmath15 .",
    "another prediction of the model is of the price diffusion rate , which drives the volatility of prices and is the primary determinant of financial risk .",
    "if we assume that prices make a random walk , then the diffusion rate measures the size and frequency of its increments .",
    "the variance @xmath16 of an uncorrellated normal random walk after time @xmath17 grows as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the diffusion rate .",
    "we choose to measure the price diffusion rate rather than the volatility because it is a stationary quantity that provides a more fundamental description of the volatility process .",
    "this is the main free parameter in the bachelier model @xcite , and while its value is essential for risk estimation and derivative pricing there is very little understanding of what determines it .",
    "numerical experiments indicate that the short term price diffusion rate predicted by the model is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a constant .",
    "the model was constructed to be simple enough to be analytically tractable , and so makes many strong assumptions .",
    "for example , it assumes that the rates for buying and selling are equal , the sizes of limit orders and market orders are the same , that limit order deposition is uniform on semi - infinite intervals , and that rates of order submission are unaffected by changes in price . many of these assumptions are economically unreasonable in the presence of intelligent agents , but the reader should bear in mind that the only market participants in the model are zero - intelligence `` noise '' traders , who can be thought of as random liquidity suppliers and demanders .",
    "while intelligent agents are clearly essential for many purposes , such as determining the levels of prices , what we suggest here is that for other purposes their presence is not essential .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the construction of the model and all the predictions derived from it were made prior to looking at the data .",
    "we test this model with data from the electronic open limit order book of the london stock exchange ( sets ) , which includes about half of the total volume on the exchange .",
    "we used data from eleven stocks for august 1st 1998 - april 30th 2000 , which includes 434 trading days and a total of roughly six million events .",
    "for all these stocks the number of total events exceeds 300,000 and was never less than 80 on any given day ( where an event corresponds to an order placement or cancellation ) .",
    "orders placed during the opening auction are removed to accomodate the fact that the model only applies for the continuous auction .",
    "see the supplementary material section  [ datasetdesc ] for more details .",
    "> from the point of view of the model , the order flow rates @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , and the mean order size @xmath2 are all free parameters . in analyzing the model",
    "we find scaling relations connecting these parameters to the average spread and the price diffusion rate , as given in equations  [ spreadscaling ] and [ volscaling ] .",
    "we test the model by testing the validity of these relations , taking advantage of the fact that different stocks have different average values of these parameters . for each stock",
    "we measure the average market order arrival rate @xmath3 , limit order rate density @xmath4 , cancellation rate @xmath5 , and order size @xmath2 , where the averages are taken across the full time period .",
    "we then measure the average spread and volatility and compare them to the predictions of the model .",
    "a problem occurs in measuring @xmath4 and @xmath5 due to the simplifying assumption of a uniform distribution of prices for order flow and cancellation . in the real data order placement and cancellation",
    "are concentrated near the best prices @xcite .",
    "we cope with this by making the assumption that order placement is uniform inside a price window around the best prices , and zero outside this window .",
    "we choose the price window to correspond to roughly @xmath22 of limit orders at the best prices , and compute @xmath4 by dividing the number of shares of limit orders placed inside the price window by the size of the price window .",
    "we do this for each day and compute the average value of @xmath4 for each stock .",
    "we compute @xmath5 as the inverse of the average cancellation time for orders cancelled inside the same price window .",
    "see the supplementary material section  [ param_measurement ] for details .",
    "the scaling laws that we describe here do not make temporal predictions , but rather are restrictions of state variables .",
    "the ideal gas law , @xmath23 , provides a good analogy .",
    "it predicts that pressure @xmath24 , volume @xmath16 , and temperature @xmath25 are constrained  any two of them determines the third .",
    "similarly , here we are testing two relations relating properties of orders to properties of prices .",
    "we are not attempting to predict the temporal behavior of the order flows , only trying to see whether the restrictions between order flows and prices are valid .",
    "we would like to emphasize that in testing the model we are not treating the order flow rates and order size as free parameters in the regressions .",
    "instead , we are testing the predictions of the model based on order flow rates against the measured values in the same period .",
    "the only free parameters are in the specification of the price interval as described above ( which was done more or less arbitrarily ) .",
    "to test equation  [ spreadscaling ] , we measure the average spread @xmath26 across the full time period for each stock , and compare to the predicted average spread @xmath27 based on order flows .",
    "spread is measured as the daily average of @xmath28 .",
    "the spread is measured after each event , with each event given equal weight . the opening auction is excluded .    to test our hypothesis that the predicted and actual values coincide , we perform a regression of the form @xmath29 .",
    "we used logarithms because the spread is positive and the log of the spread is approximately normally distributed .",
    "we use the free parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 for hypothesis testing .",
    "based on the model we predict that the comparison should yield a straight line with @xmath32 and @xmath33 , but because of the degree of freedom in choosing the price interval as described above , the value of @xmath31 is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the least squares regression , shown together with the data comparing the predictions to the actual values in fig .",
    "[ spreadregression ] , gives @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we thus strongly reject the null hypothesis that @xmath36 , indicating that the predictions are far better than random .",
    "more importantly , we are unable to reject the null hypothesis that @xmath37 .",
    "in fact , we are also unable to reject @xmath38 , but this is probably largely a matter of luck in our choice of the price interval .",
    "the regression has @xmath39 , so the model explains most of the variance .",
    "note that because of long - memory effects and cross - correlations between stocks the errors in the regression are larger than they would be for iid data ( see the discussion in the supplemenary material section  [ regressionerrors ] ) .     -2 cm      as for the spread , we compare the predicted price diffusion rate based on order flows to the actual price diffusion rate @xmath40 for each stock averaged over the 21 month period , and regress the logarithm of the predicted vs. actual values , as shown in fig .",
    "[ diffusionregression ] .",
    "-2 cm    the regression gives @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "thus , we again strongly reject the null hypothesis that @xmath36 .",
    "we are still unable to reject the null hypothesis that @xmath37 with @xmath43 confidence , though there is some suggestion that the scaling of the model and the actual values are not quite the same .",
    "( this could happen if , for example , the scaling exponent predicted by the model of one or more of the order flow rates is wrong ; however this suggests that it is at least quite close ) .",
    "although the results are not as good as for the spread , @xmath44 , so the model still explains most of the variance .",
    "market impact is practically important because it is the dominant source of transaction costs for large traders , and conceptually important because it provides a convenient probe of the revealed supply and demand functions in the limit order book .",
    "when a market order of size @xmath45 arrives , if sufficiently large , it will remove all the stored limit orders at the best bid or ask , causing a change in the midpoint price @xmath46 .",
    "the average market impact function @xmath47 is the average logarithmic midpoint price shift @xmath48 conditioned on order size , @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "a long - standing mystery about market impact is that it is highly concave @xcite .",
    "this is unexpected since simple arguments would suggest that because of the multiplicative nature of returns , market impact should grow at least linearly @xcite .",
    "the model we are testing predicts a concave average market impact function , with the concavity becoming more pronounced for small values of @xmath13 .",
    "however , these predictions are not in good detailed agreement with the data , in that the model predicts a larger variation with @xmath50 than what is actually observed . however , the model is still useful for understanding market impact , as described below .      a surprising regularity of the average market impact function is uncovered by simply plotting the data in non - dimensional coordinates , as shown in fig .",
    "[ marketimpactpic ] .",
    "see the supplementary material section  [ modelbackground ] for a discussion of how the nondimensional coordinates are derived from the model .",
    "each market order @xmath51 causes a possible change @xmath52 in the midquote price . if we bin together events with similar @xmath45 and plot the mean order size as a function of the mean price impact @xmath48",
    ", we typically see highly variable behavior for different stocks , as shown in fig .",
    "[ marketimpactpic](b ) .",
    "we have also explored other ways of renormalizing the order size , such as taking the ratio of each order s size to the daily or full - sample mean , but they give similar behavior , as shown in the supplementary material section  [ marketimpact ] .    plotting the data in non - dimensional units",
    "tells a simpler story .",
    "this involves normalizing the price shift and order size by appropriate dimensional scale factors based on the daily order flow rates .",
    "in particular , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are the average order flow rates for day @xmath17 .",
    "the data collapses onto roughly a single curve , as shown in fig .",
    "[ marketimpactpic](a ) .",
    "the variations from stock to stock are quite small ; on average the corresponding bins for each stock deviate from each other by about @xmath58 , roughly the size of the statistical sampling error .",
    "we have made an extensive analysis , but due to problems caused by the long - memory property of these time series and cross correlations between stocks , it remains unclear whether these differences are statistically significant .",
    "in contrast , using standard coordinates the differences are highly statistically significant .",
    "this collapse illustrates that the non - dimensional coordinates dictated by the model provide substantial explanatory power : we can understand how the average market impact varies from stock to stock by a simple transformation of coordinates .",
    "plotting in double logarithmic scale shows that the curve of the collapse is roughly a power law of the form @xmath59  ( see supplementary material , section  [ marketimpact ] ) .",
    "this provides a more fundamental explanation for the empirically constructed collapse of average market impact for the new york stock exchange found earlier  @xcite .",
    "-2 cm   -3 cm",
    "the model we have presented here does a good job of predicting the average spread , and a decent job of predicting the price diffusion rate . also , by simply plotting the data in non - dimensional coordinates we get a better understanding of the regularities of market impact .",
    "these results are remarkable because the underlying model completely drops agent rationality , instead focusing all its attention on the problem of understanding the constraints imposed by the continuous double auction .",
    "the approach taken here can be viewed as a divide and conquer strategy . rather than attempting to explain the properties of the market from fundamental assumptions about utility maximization by individual agents , we divide the problem into two parts .",
    "the first and much easier problem , addressed here , is that of understanding the characteristics of the market given the order flows .",
    "the second ( and harder ) problem , which remains to be investigated , is that of explaining why order flow varies as it does . explaining order flow involves behavioral and/or strategic issues that are likely to be much more difficult to understand .",
    "the model that we test succeeds in part because it takes explicit advantage of information that is available in a continuous double auction , that is not available in a standard walrasian auction . by measuring the rate of market order placement vs. limit order placement , and the rate of order cancellation , we are able to measure how patient or impatient traders are . a higher ratio of market orders to limit orders , or a higher rate of cancellation implies a less patient , and therefore more volatile market , with larger spreads .",
    "the model makes this quantitative .",
    "the agreement with the model indicates that the degree of patience is an important determinant of market behavior .",
    "this is potentially compatible with either a rationality - based explanation in terms of information arrival , or a behavioral - based explanation driven by emotional response , but in either case it suggests that patience is a key factor .",
    "this is part of a broader research program that might be characterized as the `` low - intelligence '' approach to economics : we begin with zero - intelligence agents to get a good benchmark of the effect of market institutions , and once this benchmark is well - understood , add a little intelligence , moving toward market efficiency .",
    "we thus start from zero rationality and work our way up , in contrast to the canonical approach of starting from perfect rationality and working down .",
    "follow - up research will examine the effects of adding bounded rationality .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "these results have several practical implications . for market practitioners , understanding the spread and",
    "the market impact function is very useful for estimating transaction costs and for developing algorithms that minimize their effect . for regulators",
    "they suggest that it may be possible to make prices less volatile and lower transaction costs by creating incentives for limit orders and disincentives for market orders .",
    "these scaling laws might be used to detect anomalies , e.g. a higher than expected spread might be due to improper market maker behavior .",
    "the model we test here was constructed before looking at the data @xcite , and was designed to be as simple as possible for analytic analysis .",
    "a more realistic ( but necessarily more complicated ) model would more closely mimic the properties of real order flows , which are price dependent and strongly correlated both in time and across price levels , or might incorporate elements of the strategic interactions of agents .",
    "an improved model would hopefully be able to capture more features of the data than those we have studied here .",
    "we know there are ways in which the current model is inappropriate , e.g. , predicts unrealistically strong negative autocorrelations in prices , allowing arbitrage opportunities that do not exist in the real market .",
    "nonetheless , as we have shown above , this extremely simple model does a good job of explaining some important properties of markets , such as transaction costs , price diffusion and market impact .",
    "it does this by focusing on the way order placement and price formation interact to alter the accumulation of stored supply and demand .",
    "for the phenomena studied here this appears to be the dominant effect .",
    "we do not mean to claim that market participants are unintelligent : indeed , one of the virtues of this model is that it provides a benchmark to separate properties that are driven by the statistical mechanics of the market institution from those that are driven by conditional strategic behavior .",
    "it is surprising that such a simple model can explain anything at all about a system as complex as a market .",

    "one of the virtues of this model is that we can make approximate predictions of several of its properties with almost no work using dimensional analysis .",
    "this also greatly simplifies the analysis and understanding of the model , and is particularly useful for understanding market impact .",
    "there are three fundamental dimensional quantities describing everything in this model : _ shares _ , _ price _ , and _",
    "time_. there are five parameters defined in the model .",
    "when the dimensional constraints between the parameters are taken into account , this leaves only two independent degrees of freedom .",
    "it turns out that the order flow rates @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 are more important than the discreteness parameters @xmath2 and @xmath6 , in the sense that the properties of the model are much more sensitive to variations in the order flow rates than they are to variations in @xmath2 or @xmath6 .",
    "it therefore natural to construct non - dimensional units based on the order flow parameters alone .",
    "there are unique combinations of the three order flow rates with units of _ shares _ , _ price _ , and _",
    "time_. this gives characteristic scales for price , shares , and time , that are unique up to a constant .",
    "in particular , the characteristic number of shares @xmath60 , the characteristic price interval @xmath61 , and the characteristic timescale @xmath62 .",
    "these characteristic scales can be used to define non - dimensional coordinates based on the order flow rates .",
    "these are @xmath63 for price , @xmath64 for shares , and @xmath65 for time .",
    "the use of non - dimensional coordinates has the great advantage that it reduces the number of degrees of freedom from five to two , and many quantities are much more well - behaved and easily understood when plotted in non - dimensional coordinates than they are otherwise .",
    "the remaining two degrees of freedom are naturally discussed in terms of non - dimensional versions of the discreteness parameters .",
    "a non - dimensional scale parameter based on order size is constructed by dividing the typical order size @xmath2 ( with dimensions of _ shares _ ) by the characteristic number of shares @xmath66 .",
    "this gives the non - dimensional parameter @xmath67 , which characterizes the granularity of the order flow .",
    "a non - dimensional scale parameter based on tick size is constructed by dividing the tick size @xmath6 by the characteristic price , i.e. @xmath68 .",
    "the usefulness of this is that the properties of the model only depend on the two non - dimensional parameters , @xmath50 and @xmath69 : any variations of the parameters @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 that keep these two non - dimensional parameters constant gives exactly the same market properties .",
    "one of the interesting results that emerges from analysis of the model is that the effect of the granularity parameter @xmath50 is generally much more important than the tick size @xmath69 . for a more detailed discussion ,",
    "see reference  @xcite .",
    "while @xmath0 and @xmath1 make random walks , the increments of their random walks are strongly anti - correlated .",
    "this is a good example of how the properties of this model are not simple to understand .",
    "one might naively think that under iid poisson order flow , price increments should also be iid .",
    "however , due to the coupling of boundary conditions for the buy market order / sell limit order process to those of the sell market order / buy limit order process , this is not the case . because of the fact that supply and demand tend to build as one moves away from the center of the book , price reversals are more common than price changes in the same direction . as a result ,",
    "the price increments generated by this model are more anti - correlated than those of real price series .",
    "this has an interesting consequence : if we add the assumption of market efficiency , and assume that real price increments must be white , it implies that real order flow should be positively autocorrelated in order to compensate for the anticorrelations induced by the continuous double auction .",
    "this has indeed been observed to be the case  @xcite .",
    "this is of course also a criticism of the model , since it implies a lack of arbitrage efficiency .",
    "however , we wish to stress that we make no claims that this model explains everything about the market ; just that it explains a few things fairly well .",
    "the london stock exchange is composed of two parts , the electronic open limit order book , and the non - electronic upstairs market , which is used to facilitate large block trades . during the time period of our dataset 40% to 50% of total volume",
    "was routed through the electronic order book and the rest through the upstairs market .",
    "it is believed that the limit order book is the dominant price formation mechanism of the london stock exchange : about 75% of upstairs trades happen between the current best prices in the order book  @xcite .",
    "our analysis involves only the data from the electronic order book .",
    "we chose this data set to study because we have a complete record of every action taken by every participating institution , allowing us to measure the order flows and cancellations and estimate all of the necessary parameters of our model .",
    "we used data from the time period august 1st 1998 - april 30th 2000 , which includes a total of 434 trading days and roughly six million events .",
    "we chose 11 stocks each having the property that the number of total number of events exceeds 300,000 and was never less than 80 on any given day .",
    "some statistics about the order flow for each stock are given in table  [ summarystats ] .",
    "one of the effects that is evident in figs .",
    "[ spreadbootstrap](c - d ) and [ diffusionbootstrap](c - d ) is that the slope coefficients tend to decrease as @xmath70 increases .",
    "we believe this is due to the autocorrelation bias discussed in section  ( [ longvscross ] ) .",
    "it is possible to test this model either longitudinally ( across different time intervals for a given stock ) or cross - sectionally ( across different stocks over the same time period ) .",
    "we have applied tests of both types , but due to the very strong autocorrelations of the order flow rates , spread , and price diffusion rates , there are difficulties in getting a clean test of the model longitudinally . in this section",
    "we discuss these problems , and discuss some of our results on the longitudinal tests .",
    "_ a priori _ we would expect to do a better job making cross - sectional rather than longitudinal predictions .",
    "indeed , it is not clear that this model should predict anything at all about longitudinal variations . to see why",
    ", imagine that the assumptions of the model are satisfied perfectly , and suppose that the five parameters of the order flow process ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc . ) for a given stock are fixed in time .",
    "then the only daily variations we would observe in testing the model would be due to sample errors in the estimation process . even though the assumptions are satisfied perfectly , we would find no correlation between predicted and actual values .",
    "to observe such a correlation requires real variations in the parameters of the order flow process .",
    "there are also possible problems with relaxation times : if a parameter is suddenly changed , according to the model it takes the system time to reach a new steady state behavior .",
    "there are two characteristic times in the model : @xmath71 , which is the characteristic time for removal of limit orders by market orders , and @xmath72 , which is is the characteristic time for spontaneous removal of limit orders . for the data",
    "here it appears that @xmath71 is typically less than a minute , whereas @xmath72 ranges from a few minutes to a few hours .",
    "thus , @xmath72 is the slowest relaxation time , and in some cases at least it is potentially problematic for a daily analysis .",
    "in addition , there is the very significant problem that real order flows are strongly autocorrelated , discussed below .",
    "cross - sectionally , in contrast , we expect _ a priori _ that different stocks should have different parameters",
    ". there are likely to be larger variations in the parameters between stocks than in the parameters for a given stock at different times .",
    "in addition , for a cross - sectional analysis there are no problems with relaxation times , and in any case averaging over longer periods of time reduces the sampling error . thus cross - sectional analysis is expected to be more promising and more reliable .    as noted , for the daily analysis , and even for cross - sectional analysis over long periods of time , there are problems caused by the long range autocorrelations of real order flow , spreads , and price diffusion rates .",
    "autocorrelations can remain strongly positive on the order of 50 days .",
    "this creates problems in performing the regression , and can result in a systematic bias in the estimated parameters .",
    "it causes severe systematic biases and interpretation problems for a daily analysis .    to produce estimates of the average values of the parameters and of the price diffusion and spread across the full 21 month period for the cross - sectional regressions",
    ", we have used the event - weighted average of the daily values .",
    "the alternative would have been to repeat the measurements as done for the daily data on a 21 month rather than a daily time - scale .",
    "however , this latter approach would run into problems because of the opening auction , which is not treated by our model .",
    "there are price changes driven by the orders received during the opening auction , and if we measured price diffusion across the full period we would be including these as well as the intra - day price movements . as a simple solution to this problem we use an event - weighted 21 month average of daily values to compute values for each of the order flow parameters , and then make predictions for each stock based on the average values .",
    "the weighting is done by the number of events in a day , which for simple quantities such as the market impact rate reduces to something that is equivalent to applying the analysis over the full period .",
    "similarly , to get the 21 month average of the spread and price diffusion we simply compute an event - weighted average of their daily values .",
    "we have tried several variations on this procedure and the differences appear to be inconsequential .    when we perform longitudinal regressions at a daily time - scale we get values for the slope coefficient of the regressions that are less than one , often by a statistically significant amount .",
    "we believe this is caused by the strong autocorrelation .",
    "for example , consider a time series process of the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is an iid noise process . in case @xmath75 are i.i.d .",
    ", regressing @xmath76 against @xmath75 will result in coefficients that are systematically too small , due to the fact that the @xmath77 term damps the response of @xmath76 to changes in @xmath75 . of course",
    ", one can fix this in the simple example above by simply including @xmath77 in the regression  @xcite . for the real data , however , the autocorrelation structure is more complicated  indeed we believe it is a long - memory process  which is not well modeled by an ar process in the above form . without finding a proper characterization of the autocorrelation structure ,",
    "we are likely to make errors in estimating the dependence of the predicted and actual values .",
    "this is borne out in the error analysis presented in section  ( [ regressionerrors ] ) , where we see that as we break the data into shorter subsamples , the estimated slope coefficients systematically decrease for the spread and the price diffusion .",
    "if we fit a function of the form @xmath78 to the market impact curve , we get @xmath79 for buy orders and @xmath80 for sell orders , as shown in fig .",
    "[ loglog ] .",
    "the functional form of the market impact we observe here is not in agreement with a recent theory by gabaix et al .",
    "@xcite , which predicts @xmath81 . while the error bars given are standard errors , and are certainly too optimistic , it is nontheless quite clear that the data are inconsistent with @xmath82 , as discussed in ref .",
    "this relates to an interesting debate : the theory for average market impact put forth by gabaix et al .",
    "follows traditional thinking in economics , and postulates that agents optimize their behavior to maximize profits , while the theory we test here assumes that they behave randomly , and that the form of the average market impact function is dictated by the statistical mechanics of price formation .          the market impact function is closely related to the more familiar notions of supply and demand .",
    "we have chosen to measure average market impact in this paper rather than average relative supply and demand for reasons of convenience .",
    "measuring the average relative supply and demand requires reconstructing the limit order book at each instant , which is both time consuming and error prone .",
    "the average market impact function , in contrast , can be measured based on a time series of orders and best bid and ask prices .    at any instant in time",
    "the stored queue of sell limit orders reveals the quantity available for sale at each price , thus showing the supply , and the stored buy orders similarly show the revealed demand .",
    "the price shift caused by a market order of a given size depends on the stored supply or demand through a moment expansion @xcite .",
    "thus , the collapse of the market impact function reflects a corresponding property of supply and demand .",
    "normally one would assume that supply and demand are functions of human production and desire ; the results we have presented here suggest that on a short timescale in financial markets their form is dictated by the dynamical interaction of order accumulation , removal by market orders and cancellation , and price diffusion .",
    "we have demonstrated a good collapse of the market impact using nondimensional units .",
    "however , in deciding what `` good '' means , one should compare this to the best alternatives available .",
    "we compare to three such alternatives . in figure",
    "[ altcollapse ] , the top left        pane shows the collapse when using non - dimensional units derived from the model ( repeated from the main text ) .",
    "the top right plot shows the average market impact when we instead normalise the order size by its sample mean .",
    "order size is measured in units of shares and market impact is in log price difference .",
    "the bottom left attempts to take into account daily variations of trading volume , normalising the order size by the average order size for that stock on that day . in the bottom",
    "right we use trade price to normalise the order sizes which are now in monetary units ( british pounds ) .",
    "we visually see that none of the alternative rescalings comes close to the collapse we obtain when using non - dimensional units ; because of the much greater dispersion , the error bars in each case are much larger .",
    "assigning error bars to the average market impact is difficult because the absolute price changes @xmath48 have a slowly decaying positive autocorrelation function .",
    "this may be a long - memory process , although this is not as obvious as it is for other properties of the market , such as the volume and sign of orders @xcite .",
    "the _ signed _ price changes @xmath48 have an autocorrelation function that rapidly decays to zero , but to compute market impact we sort the values into bins , and all the values in the bin have the same sign .",
    "one might have supposed that because the points entering a given bin are not sequential in time , the correlation would be sufficiently low that this might not be a problem . however ,",
    "the autocorrelation is sufficiently strong that its effect is still significant , particularly for smaller market impacts , and must be taken into account .    to cope with this we assign error bars to each bin using the variance plot method described in , for example , beran  @xcite , section 4.4 .",
    "this is a more straightforward version of the method discussed in section  ( [ regressionerrors ] ) .",
    "the sample of size @xmath83 is divided into @xmath70 subsamples of @xmath84 points adjacent in time .",
    "we compute the mean for each subsample , vary @xmath84 , and compute the standard deviation of the means across the @xmath85 subsamples .",
    "we then make use of theorem 2.2 from beran  @xcite that states that the error in the @xmath84 sample mean of a long - memory process is @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a positive coefficient related to the hurst exponent and @xmath2 is the standard deviation . by plotting",
    "the standard deviation of the @xmath70 estimated intercepts as a function of @xmath84 we estimate @xmath87 and extrapolate to @xmath88 to get an estimate of the error in the full sample mean .",
    "an example of an error scaling plot for one of the bins of the market impact is given in fig .",
    "[ errorscaling ] .     denotes the number of points in the @xmath70 different samples , and the vertical axis is the standard deviation of the @xmath70 sample means .",
    "we estimate the error of the full sample mean by extrapolating @xmath84 to the full sample length . ]    a central question about fig .",
    "[ marketimpactpic ] is whether the data for different stocks collapse onto a single curve , or whether there are statistically significant idiosyncratic variations from stock to stock . from the results presented in fig .",
    "[ marketimpactpic ] this is not completely clear .",
    "most of the stocks collapse onto the curve for the pooled data ( or the pooled data set with themselves removed ) .",
    "there are a few that appear to make statistically significant variations , at least if we assume that the mean value of the bins for different order size levels are independent .",
    "however , they are most definitely _ not _ independent , and this non - independence is difficult to model . in any case , the variations are always fairly small , not much larger than the error bars .",
    "thus the collapse gives at least a good approximate understanding of the market impact , even if there are some small idiosyncratic variations it does not capture .",
    "in the interest of full disclosure , and as a stimulus for future work , in this section we detail the ways in which the current model does not accurately match the data , and sketch possible improvements .",
    "this model was intended to describe a few average statistical properties of the market , some of which it describes very well .",
    "however , there are several aspects that it does not describe well , such as the scale - free power law properties .",
    "this would require a more sophisticated model of order flow , including a more realistic model of price dependence in order placement and cancellations @xcite , long - memory properties @xcite and the relationship of the different components of the order flow to each other .",
    "this is a much harder problem , and is likely to require a more complicated model . while this would have some advantages",
    ", it would also have some disadvantages .",
    "* _ price diffusion . _",
    "the variance of real prices obeys the relationship @xmath89 to a good approximation for all values of @xmath90 , with @xmath91 close to and typically a little greater than @xmath92 .",
    "in contrast , under poisson order flow , due to the dynamics of the double continuous auction price formation process , prices make a strongly anti - correlated random walk , so that the function @xmath93 is nonlinear",
    ". asymptotically @xmath94 , but for shorter times @xmath95 .",
    "alternatively , one can characterize this in terms of a timescale - dependent diffusion rate @xmath96 , so that the variance of prices increases as @xmath97 .",

    "note that it is very interesting that the double continuous auction produces anti - correlations in prices , even with no correlation in order flow .",
