    "a binary stars system is one of the most common systems in a galaxy and the universe [ 1,2 ] .",
    "this binary system form an effective gravitational potential which bring about five lagrangian points in the space where gravitational force is zero [ 3 ] .",
    "one of the most important lagrangian points is called @xmath0 and is located between the two stars , where the equipotential called roche - lobe [ 4 ] , makes a cross path . if the mass of the star fulfill its lobe , there will be a transference of mass to the other star , through the lagrange point @xmath0 .",
    "this is one of the most common mechanism of transference of mass between two stars , and it is the one we are interested in our study .",
    "a usual situation occurs when one star has finished its nuclear cycle fuel and becomes a red giant [ 5 ] . of course , to fully analyze this phenomenon we requires computer simulation of the whole system",
    "however , it would be important if we had a qualitative understanding of the dynamics involved , and this is the propose of this paper . on the first part of our study ,",
    "the six ordinary second order equations which represents the dynamics of the binary system with time depending mass transference is reduced to a 1-d non autonomous system .",
    "this non autonomous system is solved numerically , and the results are analyzed .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be the masses of the stars in the binary system such that @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( constant ) for all the time into consideration .",
    "this means that we will only consider the transference of mass between the two stars . with respect an inertial reference system ( fixed with respect the fixed galaxies ) ,",
    "the non relativistic motion of the system is described by newton s equation [ 6 ]    @xmath5    and @xmath6    where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the positions , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the velocities of the stars ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "@xmath12 is the gravitational constant ( @xmath13)[7 ] .",
    "the above equations represent six second order ordinary differential equations ( 6-d problem ) , and it is not difficult to see that making the usual change of variables to center of mass ( @xmath14 ) and relative ( @xmath15 ) coordinates does not help to reduce the number of degree of freedom in our system due to the time depending mass variation .",
    "however , since we are assuming that @xmath3 , we can select our reference system such that @xmath16 ( non inertial reference system seen from the far away fixed - galaxies in the sky ) , and neglect all non inertial forces ( coriolis ) which normally appears on this type of reference systems .",
    "in addition , our stars are assumed to be points - like mathematical elements .",
    "so , making this selection , and defining @xmath17 and @xmath18 , one gets the following newton s equation of motion for the binary system @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 . making the differentiation with respect the time of @xmath23 , the equation ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "let us write now this equation in spherical coordinates , @xmath26 where the position ( @xmath27 ) , velocity ( @xmath28 ) and acceleration ( @xmath29 ) are written in term of the unitary vectors @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 as    @xmath33    @xmath34    and @xmath35    where the unitary vectors are    @xmath36    using ( [ po ] ) , ( [ ve ] ) , and ( [ ac ] ) in ( [ eq2 ] ) , the following equations are obtained    @xmath37    from ( [ 3r ] ) we observe that @xmath38 is a possible solution of these equations ( @xmath39 ) , meaning that that the motion of the system can occur in the plane defined by @xmath40 . selecting then this solution ,",
    "the above equations are reduced to a 2-d problem    @xmath41    multiplying ( [ 2r ] ) by @xmath42 and rearranging terms , one gets that @xmath43 which implies that one obtains the following constant of motion @xmath44 finally , using this constant of motion in ( [ 1r ] ) , the study is reduced to the following 1-d problem @xmath45 this equation can be written as the following non autonomous dynamical system @xmath46 this dynamical system is not integrable , but it can be analyzed numerically . to do this , a model for the mass transference is required , and this will be seen below .",
    "we will use the following three models of mass transference @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are constant which are relate with the mass lost ( win ) rate , @xmath50 and @xmath51 represent the initial mass of the stars ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "figures 1 , 2 and 3 show the period of the star with mass @xmath23 as a function of the number of turns around the star with mass @xmath53 for the models a , b and c. the initial values taken to make these figures are @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the radius and solar mass ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 [ 8 ] ) .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 shown in these figures were chosen big enough to point out the effect of mass variation on the period of the system .",
    "these results tell us that if @xmath23 looses mass , its period is larger each turn and , eventually , the star escapes ( or breaks ) the binary system . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath23 increases its mass , its period becomes smaller each turn .",
    "these results are in agreement with what was found on the dynamics of the comets around a star [ 7 ] .     with model a. ]     with model b. ]     with model c. ]",
    "using several approximations , the dynamics of a class of binary stars with six degrees of freedom with variable mass is reduced to one degree of freedom system with variable mass .",
    "this variation of mass was chosen such that the mass of the whole system remains constant ( closed system ) . using three models of mass transference between the stars ,",
    "we found in general that it the less massive star increases its mass from the massive star , its period becomes smaller each turn , and vice versa . the mass rate exchanged has been taken here too unrealistically large to have better visualization of the expected effect , that is , this effect does not depend on the mass model .",
    "the reason is clearly seen from expressions ( [ eq2 ] ) or the dynamical system ( [ po],[ve ] ) since it @xmath59 is positive , one has a damping system , and if @xmath59 is negative , one gets an anti - damping system .",
