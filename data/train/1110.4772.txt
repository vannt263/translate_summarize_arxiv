    "in 1950 ginzburg and landau proposed a phenomenological theory of superconductivity ( the gl theory ) based on a specific form of the free energy functional constructed in the vicinity of the critical temperature from landau s theory of second - order transitions .",
    "@xcite minimization of this functional generates the system of two gl equations that give the spatial distribution of the superconducting order parameter ( the condensate wave function ) and of the magnetic field in a superconductor . over the years , the gl approach has been enormously successful in describing various properties of superconductors ( see e.g. ref .  ) , and has been extensively used particularly in the last decade in the domain of mesoscopic superconductivity , see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "in 1957 bardeen , cooper and schrieffer ( bcs ) developed the well - known microscopic theory of the conventional superconductivity  @xcite and then , two years later , gorkov showed that the gl equations can be obtained from the bcs formalism .",
    "@xcite however , in spite of the availability of the microscopic theory , the gl approach remains still an optimal choice for many practical calculations when the spatial distribution of the pair condensate and , thus , of the magnetic field are nontrivial , e.g. , for multiple - vortex configurations .",
    "the simple differential structure of the local gl equations in comparison with the microscopic theory offers clear advantages , including the possibility of analytical derivations in many important cases .    a desire to develop an extension to the gl theory , with the idea of improving the formalism while retaining at least some advantages of its original formulation , stimulated significant efforts by many theorists .",
    "several gl - like theories of different complexity were proposed . in the earliest developments ,",
    "@xcite the so - called `` local superconductor '' formalism was attempted , being a complicated synthesis of the bcs and gl approaches .",
    "the gl theory with nonlocal corrections ( i.e. , including higher powers of the gradients of the order parameter ) was used in studies of the anisotropy of the upper critical field ( see ref .  ) and the vortex structure ( see ref .  ) in @xmath7-wave superconductors .",
    "recently , various extensions to the gl theory were introduced in the context of studying the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov state .",
    "@xcite in all the above examples , extending the gl theory was based on the expansion of the self - consistent gap equation by including higher powers of the order parameter and its spatial gradients phenomenologically .",
    "@xcite however , accounting for such higher - power terms is not as straightforward as it may seem .",
    "the fundamental problem here is to select properly all relevant contributions of the same order of magnitude ( accuracy ) .",
    "this ( serious ) issue does not arise in the derivation of the original gl theory for a single - band superconductor , where only the first non - linear term and the second - order ( leading ) gradient of the condensate wave function are included .",
    "however , as recently shown in ref .  , a similar selection performed for the gl theory of a two - band superconductor leads to the appearance of incomplete higher - order contributions .",
    "such incomplete terms may cause misleading conclusions and should be avoided .    to tackle this problem , one needs to work with a single small parameter in the expansion . in the present case",
    ", such a small parameter is the proximity to the critical temperature , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , the standard gl approach can be seen as the lowest - order theory in the @xmath9-expansion of the self - consistent gap equation , see , e.g. , refs .   and",
    ". however , next orders in @xmath9 are also of great importance , for example , to capture the physics of different healing lengths of different condensates in multi - band superconductors .",
    "@xcite in the present paper , we show that next orders in @xmath9 are also important in the single - band case , surprisingly improving the gl theory .",
    "we obtain a systematic series expansion of the self - consistent gap equation for a single - band , @xmath0-wave , clean superconductor , using @xmath9 as the governing small parameter . in the derivation",
    "we employ a technique in the spirit of the asymptotic expansion methods used extensively in the applied mathematics .",
    "@xcite similarly to the asymptotic analysis in other models , we obtain a hierarchical system of the so - called transport equations which need to be solved recursively starting from the lowest order . using this method , corrections to the standard gl theory can in principle",
    "be calculated with an arbitrary accuracy . however , unlike asymptotic expansions for linear models , here the complexity of the higher - order equations increases rapidly and their solution can not be obtained in the general form .",
    "based on the gorkov green function formalism , we derive and investigate the first three orders of the @xmath9-expansion of the gap equation , i.e. , @xmath10 with @xmath11 . to the order @xmath12",
    ", we find the equation for the critical temperature . collecting the terms proportional to @xmath13 , we obtain the standard gl theory giving the lowest - order ( in @xmath9 ) contributions to the superconducting condensate , i.e. , @xmath3 , and to the magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath4 .",
    "then , by matching the terms of the order @xmath14 , we derive equations for the next - to - leading corrections to the superconducting order parameter and magnetic field , @xmath5 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "the equations controlling the order parameter and the magnetic field up to the next - to - leading order in @xmath9 constitute the extended gl formalism ( egl ) .",
    "to illustrate the power of our extension to the gl theory , we investigate the energy associated with a surface between the superconducting ( s ) and normal ( n ) phases .",
    "in particular , we calculate the temperature dependence of @xmath16 , the value of the gl parameter at which the surface energy becomes zero .",
    "it is important to stress here that contrary to other available extensions of the gl theory discussed above , our formalism is not much more complicated than the standard gl theory . as is shown in the calculation of the s / n surface energy , plenty of important information can be obtained from the egl formalism analytically .",
    "note that as is known , the gl theory is heavily used also in the study of thermal fluctuations .",
    "here we do not address this issue but deal with an extension to the gl formalism in the mean - field level .",
    "our aim is to expand the validity domain of the gl theory down to lower temperatures , which will be useful for the problems with a strongly nonuniform distribution of the pair condensate , e.g. , for multiple vortex solution in the presence of stripes and clusters of vortices . in this case",

    "appendix  [ sec : appendix_c ] generalizes the calculations given in appendix  [ sec : appendix_a ] to the case of a nonzero magnetic field .",
    "as is known since the classical work by gorkov ,  @xcite the gl equations can be derived from the microscopic bcs theory in the most elegant way via the green function formalism . for the sake of clarity of presentation of our main ideas ,",
    "the case of zero magnetic field is considered first , while the generalization to a nonzero magnetic field is given in the next section .",
    "the goal of our work is to construct the extended gl formalism through the expansion of the gorkov equations in @xmath17 , with @xmath1 the critical temperature ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "we start by writing the gorkov equations as the dyson equation for the green function @xmath19 in the gorkov - nambu @xmath20matrix representation , which reads as ( see , e.g. , ref .  )",
    "@xmath21 with @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the fermionic matsubara frequency ( @xmath24 is an integer and @xmath25 is set to unity ) and the @xmath26 matrix gap operator @xmath27 in eq .",

    "( [ eq : gap ] ) is assumed to be properly restricted to avoid the ultraviolet divergence .",
    "equations ( [ geq ] ) and ( [ gfunc ] ) further give    [ eq : gorkov_equations ] @xmath32    for the normal - state temperature green function @xmath33 we have ( at zero magnetic field ) @xmath34 with the single - particle energy @xmath35 measured from the chemical potential @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .    the gorkov equations ( [ eq : gorkov_equations ] ) supplemented by eq .",

    "the latter is further converted into a non - linear partial differential equation by using the gradient expansion @xmath43 with @xmath44 the scalar product .",
    "in particular , the gl equation is obtained when keeping only the first two terms , including @xmath45 and @xmath46 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap_perturbation ] ) and the second - order spatial derivatives in the gradient expansion ( [ eq : gradient_expansion ] ) .    while eq .",
    "( [ eq : gap_perturbation ] ) is a regular series expansion of the gap equation ( [ eq : gap ] ) , the partial differential equation mentioned above is not .",
    "the gradient expansion introduces a second small parameter together with the corresponding truncation approximation , and the relation between the order parameter and its gradients is not known _ a priory_. as a result one can not compare the accuracy of the relevant terms in the expansion and the truncation procedure becomes ill - defined .",
    "this problem does not appear in the derivation of the gl equation where one keeps only the lowest second order gradient term . in order to extend the gl formalism",
    ", one has to deal with a single small parameter in the system that can be used to compare the relevant contributions .",
    "this small parameter follows from the solution of the gl equation .",
    "when @xmath47 the order parameter decays as @xmath48 . also the solution reveals the scaling length @xmath49 , i.e. , the gl coherence length , which determines the spatial variations of the order parameter in the vicinity of @xmath1 and dictates that @xmath50 , or , using the short - hand notation , @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath9 controls both relevant quantities and can be used to produce a single - small - parameter series expansion of the gap equation  ( [ eq : gap ] ) .",
    "a systematic expansion of the gap equation in @xmath9 can be facilitated by introducing the scaling transformation for the order parameter , the coordinates and the spatial derivatives of the order parameter in the following form : @xmath52 note that in terms of the scaled coordinates , the typical spatial variation of the order parameter occurs on a scale that is independent of @xmath9 to the leading order .",
