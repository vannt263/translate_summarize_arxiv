    "early - type galaxies in nearby rich clusters form a homogeneous population .",
    "the elliptical and s0 galaxies in clusters such as coma follow a tight color - magnitude ( cm ) relation ( bower , lucey , & ellis 1992b ) , mg@xmath9@xmath10 relation ( guzman et al .",
    "1992 ) , and fundamental plane ( e.g. , jrgensen , franx , & kjrgaard 1993 ) .",
    "the low scatter in these relations implies that the spread in the metallicities and ages of the galaxies is small at a given mass or luminosity .",
    "the homogeneity of the early - type galaxies constrains models for the formation and evolution of these galaxies ( e.g. , sandage & visvanathan 1978 , faber et al .",
    "1987 , bower et al .",
    ". in particular , the small intrinsic scatter in the cm relations of coma and virgo implies that the early - type galaxies in these clusters either formed at high redshift , or that their formation was synchronized ( bower et al .",
    "1992b ) .",
    "if the intrinsic scatter is due to age differences between the galaxies , one expects the scatter to be higher at larger lookback times .",
    "hence , the scatter in the cm relation is expected to increase with redshift .",
    "ellis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) studied the cm relation in three clusters at @xmath11 using hubble space telescope ( hst ) data .",
    "surprisingly , ellis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the cm relation of the ellipticals and s0s is still very tight at @xmath12 .",
    "this led these authors to conclude that the star formation in early - type galaxies likely ceased at much higher redshifts .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by andreon , davoust , & heim ( 1997 ) , who found a tight cm relation of the early - type galaxies in abell 851 at @xmath13 .",
    "these results were further strengthened by stanford , eisenhardt , & dickinson ( 1997 ) , who found that the scatter in the cm relation of early - type galaxies in rich clusters is nearly constant with redshift to @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , studies of the fundamental plane relation in clusters to @xmath15 show that the scatter in the relation is not very different from that in local clusters ( van dokkum & franx 1996 ; kelson et al .  1997 ; bender et al .",
    "1997 ) , indicating that the population of early - type galaxies has been stable and homogeneous over a significant fraction of the age of the universe .    the result of ellis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is surprising , because it seems difficult to reconcile with the strong evolution of the cluster population implied by the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "the enhanced fraction of blue galaxies in intermediate redshift clusters as observed by butcher & oemler ( 1978 , 1984 ) is often interpreted as the result of the transformation of blue field galaxies to red cluster galaxies ( e.g. , butcher & oemler 1984 , abraham et al .",
    "a key question is whether the end products of this transformation are early - types ( e.g. , dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) , or whether the butcher - oemler effect can be largely explained by blue spirals turning red ( butcher & oemler 1984 ) .",
    "many blue galaxies in intermediate redshift clusters have the characteristics of normal ( field ) spirals ( e.g. , couch & sharples 1987 , andreon et al .",
    "however , some have a starburst or a post starburst spectrum ( dressler & gunn 1983 ; couch & sharples 1987 ) , and it seems natural to link these post starburst galaxies to today s early - type galaxies .",
    "if a population of recently transformed early - types exists , they are expected to be bluer than the pre - existing early - types , and to increase the scatter in the cm relation .",
    "apparently , such galaxies are not in the samples studied by ellis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and stanford et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . on the other hand , the strong evolution with redshift of the morphology - density relation claimed by dressler et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is in qualitative agreement with the continuous transformation of spirals to s0s .",
    "the studies of ellis et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and stanford et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suffer from two limitations : membership information is sparse , and the field sizes are small . the membership information is important because it is crucial to measure the full distribution of galaxies in the color - magnitude plane , and the blue side of the cm relation is heavily contaminated by field galaxies .",
    "usually , a correction is applied by subtracting the expected number of field galaxies based on number counts . since the number counts can vary in a small field , it is obviously preferable to have direct spectroscopic membership information .",
    "a large angular coverage is of particular importance , since there is good evidence that the blue galaxies are more abundant at larger distances from the cluster center ( e.g. , butcher & oemler 1984 , pickles & van der kruit 1991 , abraham et al .",
    "an environmental dependence is also indicated by the evidence for young populations in early - type galaxies in the field ( e.g. , larson , tinsley , & caldwell 1980 , bothun & gregg 1990 ) .",
    "if there are ( mildly ) blue early - type galaxies in intermediate redshift clusters , it seems likely that they reside in the transition region between the cluster and the field .    in the present study",
    ", we extend the study of the cm relation to larger radii , using a large @xmath16 hst mosaic of the cluster cl1358 + 62 at @xmath0 .",
    "we determine morphologies , colors , and magnitudes for 194 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members within the hst mosaic .",
    "the color - magnitude relation in intermediate redshift clusters has been studied extensively ( e.g. , aragon - salamanca et al.1993 , rakos & schombert 1995 , abraham et al .  1996b , ellis et al.1997 , stanford et al .",
    "1997 ) , but never before with high resolution , large format images .",
    "the aims of this study are to constrain the star formation histories of the galaxies , and to establish whether the histories depend on morphology or environment .",
    "in particular , we test whether star formation in the ellipticals and s0 galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster has persisted to more recent epochs than star formation in early - type galaxies in the cluster core .",
    "the present sample is based on a large spectroscopic survey of the cluster .",
    "the spectra were obtained with multislit masks at the multiple mirror telescope and the william herschel telescope . the sample selection and the reduction and analysis of the spectroscopic data",
    "are described in detail in fabricant , mcclintock , & bautz ( 1991 ) , and fisher et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . here , we briefly summarize the sample selection .",
    "the spectroscopic sample was selected on the basis of @xmath17 magnitude .",
    "twenty multislit aperture masks were exposed within a @xmath210@xmath18@xmath1911@xmath18 field centered on the brightest cluster galaxy in cl1358 + 62 , and redshifts for 387 galaxies were determined .",
    "the sample of galaxies with redshifts is @xmath20% complete to @xmath21 , or @xmath22 , dropping steeply to @xmath23% at @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the completeness within the @xmath16 hst wfpc2 field ( see below ) is somewhat higher : @xmath26% to @xmath27 , and @xmath28% at @xmath29 .",
    "this incompleteness is caused by the limited number of galaxies that was observed , and not by the inability to measure the redshifts of observed galaxies .",
    "the `` success rate '' of measuring the redshift is @xmath30% to @xmath31 .",
    "the success rate drops to @xmath32% at @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) , and @xmath35% at @xmath36 .",
    "the success rate does not depend strongly on color , for @xmath37 ( fisher et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to fisher et al .",
    "( 1997 ) for a discussion of cluster membership and substructure in the cluster .",
    "following fisher et al . , we include as cluster members all galaxies in the interval @xmath38 .",
    "the subsample used for this paper consists of all 194 confirmed cluster members in the @xmath16 hst wfpc2 field ( see below ) . for the analysis in sect .",
    "[ cm.sec ] , we furthermore impose a magnitude limit of @xmath39 , reducing the sample to 188 galaxies .      wfpc2 images from twelve hst pointings were combined to give an @xmath40 field centered on the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) in cl1358 + 62 .",
    "the cluster was observed with the @xmath41 and @xmath42 filters ( close to rest frame @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , on february 15 , 1996 .",
    "exposure times were 3600s in each filter , for each pointing .",
    "figure [ mosaic.plot ] [ plate 1 ] shows the field layout .",
    "the pipeline reduction was performed at the space telescope science institute ( stsci ) .",
    "no recalibration was done , and we verified that the most recent calibration files had been used in the pipeline processing .",
    "the crucial step in the data reduction was the sky subtraction .",
    "the cluster was observed in the continuous viewing zone ( cvz ) of hst .",
    "the sky background is fairly high in most exposures , due to reflected earth light .",
    "the earth light reflects off the optical telescope assembly ( ota ) and scatters throughout the wfpc2 field . in most exposures ,",
    "dark diagonal bands are present ; these appear when the ota vanes pass into the shadow of the wfpc2 camera relay spiders ( see biretta , ritchie , & rudloff  1995 ) .",
    "three identical 1200s exposures were obtained in each filter .",
    "the exposures were timed to minimize the scattered light in one of the three exposures . for the majority of exposures , we modelled the background in two steps .",
    "first , the image with the lowest background was subtracted from the two other images .",
    "second , the residual images ( containing the background structure + noise ) were fitted with high order 2d polynomials .",
    "these fits were then subtracted from the high background images .",
    "finally , we checked the results by eye and iterated to minimize the residuals of the cross patterns . in all @xmath41 exposures",
    "this method worked well .",
    "however , in four of the twelve @xmath42 pointings the background structure was present in all three exposures . for these pointings , the cross pattern in the lowest background image was carefully fitted and subtracted before subtracting this image from the higher background images .    in 10 of the 72 exposures",
    "bright linear features are present , due to the passage of bright objects through the field of view during the exposures ( biretta et al .",
    "the areas affected by these features were masked before the three exposures of each field were combined .",
    "when both a high background and a bright streak are present , the bright streak was masked before modeling the background .",
    "the individual exposures were combined with the crreject task , incorporated in the iraf stsdas reduction package .",
    "the output cosmic ray mask files were visually checked to verify that only cosmic rays were removed .",
    "hot pixels were corrected by creating a `` dark '' frame from the exposures themselves ; the twelve pointings were median filtered to identify the locations of hot pixels .",
    "bad pixels and bad columns were removed by interpolation .",
    "the full field is shown in fig .",
    "[ mosaic.plot ] [ plate 1 ] .",
    "the total area of the image is 49arcmin@xmath45 .",
    "the galaxy density decreases with distance from the bcg , allowing us to study the dependence of the properties of the cluster galaxies on local galaxy density .",
    "[ center.plot ] [ plate 2 ] is a color image of the central part of the cluster .",
    "clearly , most of the cluster galaxies have very similar colors , but our spectroscopy shows that many of the blue galaxies are also cluster members ( fisher et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the @xmath41 and @xmath42 hst wfpc2 filters are close to the rest frame @xmath43 and @xmath44 bands for an object with @xmath0 . as noted by many authors , standard @xmath46-corrections may introduce large errors , due to the effects of spectral evolution and intrinsic scatter in galaxy colors .",
    "therefore , we followed the procedure described in van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) , and derived direct transformations from the hst filters to the redshifted @xmath44 band , denoted with @xmath47 , and @xmath48 colors : @xmath49 @xmath50 for the early - type galaxies in cl1358 + 62 , @xmath51 .",
    "the zero points of the @xmath42 and @xmath41 filters are based on the vega spectrum , and taken from table 41.1 in the hst data handbook ( leitherer 1995 ) .",
    "using spectral energy distributions from pence  ( 1976 ) , we find the transformations are independent of galaxy type to @xmath52 magnitudes , for early - types and early - type spirals .",
    "we have extracted @xmath53 images of all 194 galaxies from the wfpc2 frames .",

    "four of us ( pvd , mf , dk , and gdi ) morphologically classified the galaxies .",
    "our classification scheme is identical to that used by dressler ( 1980 ) for galaxies in nearby clusters .",
    "five morphological types are distinguished : e , s0 , s , irregular , and unclassified .",
    "these morphological types were assigned on the basis of two qualifiers : early - type / late - type / irregular , and disk / no disk / irregular .",
    "the division between late - type and early - type is determined by the presence of spiral arms and the smoothness of the image .",
    "the disk qualifier is based on the presence of a disk .",
    "because faint , face - on disks in s0 galaxies are very difficult to detect , early - type galaxies that were classified as diskless may contain disks at low inclinations ( see , e.g. , rix & white 1990 , jrgensen & franx 1994 ) .",
    "if at least three out of four authors agreed on the value of the qualifier the value was set to the median of the values of the four authors .",
    "if there was no such agreement , the type qualifier and / or disk qualifier were set to `` uncertain '' .",
    "our classifications fit directly into dressler s ( 1980 ) scheme .",
    "ellipticals are early - type galaxies without a disk , s0s are early - type galaxies with a disk , and spirals are late - type galaxies with a disk .",
    "galaxies with type and/or disk qualifier `` irregular '' are classified as irregulars .",

    "the reliability of visual classifications has been discussed extensively ( e.g. , abraham et al .",
    "1996a , smail et al .",
    "it appears that the robustness of the classification of hst images of galaxies at @xmath54 is not very different from that of the classification of galaxies in nearby clusters observed from the ground ; even at low redshift it is difficult to distinguish between adjacent hubble types .",

    "three of the four authors agree on @xmath55% of the galaxies to @xmath56 .",
    "the improvement in the consistency of the classifications at magnitudes fainter than @xmath57 is probably real .",
    "the galaxy sample is dominated by irregular galaxies below this magnitude , and these galaxies are more easily distinguished from the other types than , e.g. , ellipticals from s0s .",
    "some of the galaxies in the sample have faint , smooth spiral structure ( e.g. , galaxy 328 ) . in the adopted classification scheme",
    ", these galaxies could either be classified as spirals ( on the basis of the spiral features ) , or s0s ( on the basis of the absence of star formation regions and dust ) . it is not clear how these galaxies fit into the hubble sequence .",
    "we will discuss the properties of these galaxies in more detail in future papers on the morphology - density relation , and the `` e+a '' galaxies in cl1358 + 62 .",
    "we note here that four of these ambiguous galaxies were classified as s0s , the remainder as spirals .",
    "we compared the limiting magnitude of our classifications to the limits adopted by smail et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and ellis et al .  (",
    "smail et al.classify galaxies to a limit ( in signal - to - noise ) @xmath58 magnitudes fainter than in our study , and ellis et al .  to a limit",
    "@xmath59 magnitudes fainter .",
    "the visual classifications are by their nature not very quantitative , nor can we assess systematic errors . because the vast majority of cluster galaxies in the present sample are early - type galaxies ,",
    "it is desirable to have a quantitative indicator of the bulge - to - disk ratios of these galaxies , to have an alternative way to discriminate between bulge dominated and disk dominated galaxies . as noted by saglia et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the srsic ( 1968 ) @xmath60 parameter provides a rough measure of the bulge - to - disk ratio . the value of @xmath60 that gives the lowest @xmath61 in a fit of the galaxy profile to an @xmath62 law depends on the relative contributions of the bulge and the disk .",
    "if the disk dominates , @xmath60 will be close to 1 ( i.e. an exponential profile ) , if the bulge dominates , @xmath60 will be close to 4 ( i.e. the de vaucouleurs @xmath63 law ) .",
    "all images of the cluster galaxies were fitted with two - dimensional @xmath62-law models ( srsic 1968 ) , with @xmath64 , which were convolved with the hst point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the psfs were generated with tiny tim 4.0b ( krist 1995 ) .",
    "for each galaxy , a separate psf was used , appropriate to the galaxy position on the wf chip .",
    "the fitting method uses the full 2d information rather than an azimuthally averaged light profile .",
    "the fitting program determines the position , ellipticity , position angle , effective radius @xmath65 , and the surface brightness at the effective radius @xmath66 .",
    "the method is described for the @xmath67 case ( the de vaucouleur @xmath63-law ) in van dokkum & franx ( 1996 ) .",
    "models with @xmath68 were fitted to the galaxy images .",
    "the @xmath61 values of the four fits were compared to choose the ` best fitting profile type ' for each galaxy .",
    "we have performed simulations to test how well the @xmath60 parameter correlates with bulge - to - disk ratio .",
    "artifical galaxies were created with varying bulge - to - disk ratios , inclinations , and effective radii of the bulges and the disks .",
    "the effective radii of the disks span a range from half the effective radius of the bulge to twice the effective radius of the bulge . in the simulations ,",
    "the surface brightness profiles of the bulges follow @xmath63 laws , and the surface brightness profiles of the disks are exponential .",
    "the artificial galaxies were convolved with tiny tim psfs , before determining the @xmath60 parameter .",
    "we used the same procedure to determine the best fitting profile type @xmath60 as for the cluster galaxies .",
    "the simulations show that the @xmath60 parameter does indeed correlate with bulge - to - disk ratio , but that it is also somewhat dependent on the effective radius of the disk relative to the bulge : large , faint disks relative to the bulge give rise to higher @xmath60 values than small , bright disks . bulge fractions @xmath69% give rise to @xmath70 in @xmath71% of the cases , and bulge fractions @xmath72% always give rise to @xmath73 in our simulations .    in reality ,",
    "galaxy profiles can not always be described by the combination of a de vaucouleurs bulge and an exponential disk . as an example ,",
    "galaxy 86 is one of 2 galaxies that are best fitted by an exponential profile ( @xmath74 ) , but are visually classified as elliptical .",
    "a closer examination of its surface brightness profile reveals that it is best fitted by a combination of two exponentials .",
    "also , bars and other non - axisymmetric features complicate the interpretation of the @xmath60 parameter .    in summary ,",
    "the @xmath60 parameter is a rough measure of the bulge - to - disk ratio , but one should be cautious in drawing conclusions for individual galaxies on the basis of the @xmath60 parameter .",
    "we stress that the @xmath60 parameter is not intended as a refinement of the visual classifications , but as an independent and quantitative measure of the morphology .",
    "we will express our results in the context of both the visual classifications , and the best fitting profile type .",
    "the colors were measured from aperture photometry using the phot task in iraf .",
    "for each galaxy , the radius of the aperture @xmath75 was set equal to the effective radius , @xmath65 , as determined from the fit to an @xmath63-law .",
    "the advantage of using the effective radius rather than a larger aperture is that sky subtraction errors are small .",
    "furthermore , this procedure minimizes the effects of color gradients .    for many galaxies ,",
    "the effective radii are @xmath76 . within such small radii",
    ", the galaxy profiles are significantly affected by the point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the shape of the hst psf depends on the passband , and the measured colors within an effective radius are affected by the differences between the @xmath41 and @xmath42 psfs .",
    "we determined the importance of this effect by constructing a model galaxy with an effective radius of @xmath77 , and convolving it with @xmath41 and @xmath42 psfs generated by tiny tim .",
    "the measured color within @xmath75 turned out to be @xmath78 magnitudes bluer than the true color .",
    "after deconvolution of the model galaxy , the true color could be obtained within @xmath79 magnitudes .",
    "we tested whether the tiny tim psf is a reasonable approximation of the true psf by constructing a model galaxy using the @xmath41 and @xmath42 images of a star in the field , and deconvolving it using a tiny tim psf .",
    "again , the true color could be obtained within @xmath79 magnitudes after deconvolution .    to correct for the effects of the psf , we deconvolved all images before measuring the colors . for the deconvolutions",
    "the clean algorithm ( hgbom 1974 ) was used , which ensures flux conservation . for each galaxy",
    "a psf was created with tiny tim , appropriate for the position of the galaxy on the chip .",
    "the deconvolution does not influence the scatter in the cm relation significantly .",
    "however , the deconvolution has a small , but systematic , effect on the slope of the cm relation .",
    "we performed extensive tests to establish how our conclusions depend on the choice of aperture .",
    "we explored the effect of apertures with radii @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , as well as apertures with a fixed angular radius ( @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 ) .",
    "the systematic trends discussed in sect .",
    "[ result.sec ] also apply for all these apertures .",
    "however , the colors of individual galaxies may depend substantially on the aperture size because some galaxies have significant color gradients .",
    "we will return to this issue later .",
    "`` total '' magnitudes were measured through @xmath87 radius apertures .",
    "the error in the total magnitude contributes to the scatter in the cm relation .",
    "this can be estimated at @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the slope of the cm relation and @xmath90 is the error in the magnitude . since @xmath91 ( cf.sect .",
    "[ cmeq.sec ] ) this contribution to the scatter in the cm relation is negligible , for @xmath92 magnitude . the colors and magnitudes of all 194 galaxies in the sample are listed in table 1 .",
    "it is difficult to calibrate hst wfpc2 observations to higher absolute accuracy than @xmath93% ( see , e.g. , holtzman et al . 1995 , whitmore 1997 ) .",
    "one of the main uncertainties is the charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) which leads to efficiency variations of a few percent over individual wfpc2 chips ( whitmore 1997 ) .",
    "fortunately , all uncertainties that are effectively efficiency variations over the wfpc2 field ( such as the cte problem ) cancel out when determining colors , provided the effect is not very wavelength dependent .",
    "therefore , in principle , color differences between galaxies can be measured to very high accuracy despite limitations in the absolute calibration .",
    "the signal to noise ( s / n ) ratio in the hst observations of the spectroscopically confirmed cluster members is very high ; the formal errors in the colors measured within @xmath75 are @xmath94 magnitudes for all galaxies .",
    "however , other systematic sources of error remain , e.g. , the flatfielding , the sky subtraction , and uncertainties in the psf .",
    "the hst pointings were chosen to allow an overlap of @xmath95 between adjacent observations .",
    "therefore , a number of objects in the cl1358 + 62 field were observed twice .",
    "these repeated observations allow us to directly assess the errors in the photometry .",
    "we found 23 objects that were well exposed in two pointings ; 15 of these are spectroscopically confirmed cluster members .",
    "the galaxy colors were measured within @xmath96 radius apertures , which is the median @xmath65 of the 194 cluster members .",
    "the @xmath97 spread in the differences between the two color measurements of the 23 objects is 0.015 magnitudes , implying an uncertainty for a single observation of @xmath98 magnitudes .",
    "the 23 objects span a similar range in magnitude as the sample of 194 cluster members , and have a median magnitude of @xmath99 .",
    "we divided the sample into two bins to determine whether the measurement uncertainty depends on the magnitude . for galaxies with @xmath100",
    "the uncertainty is 0.009 . for galaxies with @xmath101",
    "the uncertainty rises to @xmath102 magnitude .",
    "we noticed that the differences between the two observations were often close to @xmath103 or @xmath104 .",
    "this is almost certainly due to systematic differences between the wfpc2 chips : after adding @xmath105 to the @xmath41 zeropoint of chip 3 , the measurement uncertainty for galaxies in the bright half of the sample was reduced to @xmath106 magnitudes .",
    "the errors in the sky subtraction and the flat fielding are probably largest near the edges of the chips .",
    "in addition , the shape of the psf has a strong positional dependence near the chip edges .",
    "therefore , the color measurement errors for galaxies near the centers of the chips are likely to be smaller than the preceding estimates .",
    "the measured scatter in the cm relation of the ellipticals and s0s ranges from @xmath107 to @xmath108 ( cf .",
    "[ cm.sec ] ) , which is significantly larger than the measurement error ( 0.011 ) .",
    "therefore , the contribution of measurement errors to the measured scatter in the cm relation is generally negligible .",
    "however , for consistency , we computed the intrinsic scatter in the cm relation by removing an uncertainty of @xmath109 magnitudes in quadrature from the measured scatter .",
    "the cm relations of cluster members of different morphological types are presented in figure  [ cm1.plot](a-d ) .",
    "the figure shows that the cm relation depends strongly on morphological type . only the ellipticals and s0s show a well defined relation , whereas the spirals and the irregulars show a large scatter in the color .",
    "few ellipticals are significant outliers from the `` ridge line '' of this relation , but the fraction of outliers is higher for the s0s .",
    "the distribution about the ridge line appears to be tighter for the ellipticals than for the s0s .",
    "we quantified these effects as follows .",
    "first , we determined the cm relation for the ellipticals with a least squares fit , excluding the two bluest galaxies .",
    "the form of this fit is @xmath110 and it is shown in all upper panels of fig .",
    "[ cm1.plot ] . for each galaxy",
    "we determined the residual color relative to the fiducial cm relation of the ellipticals : @xmath111 . from the distributions of @xmath112 for the different morphological types we determined the offset @xmath113 relative to the cm relation of the ellipticals , and the scatter @xmath10 .",
    "histograms of the distributions of @xmath112 are shown in fig .",
    "[ cm1.plot](e-h ) .",
    "the offset and the scatter were calculated using the biweight estimators for the location and the scale of a distribution .",
    "this estimator was also used by stanford et al .",
    "the biweight estimator gives higher weight to points that are closer to the center of the distribution ( see beers , flynn , & gebhardt 1990 ) .",
    "therefore , the biweight estimator is insensitive to outliers . for a gaussian distribution the biweight scale estimator reduces to the conventional rms .",

    "the blue early - type galaxies that we observe in cl1358 + 62 may therefore be recently accreted galaxies that have had their formation terminated upon entry .",

    "1996 , abraham et al .",
    "it is often suggested that the butcher - oemler effect is caused by an enhanced accretion at higher redshifts ( e.g. , kauffmann 1995 ) .",
    "the cluster cl1358 + 62 displays a mild butcher - oemler effect ( luppino et al .",
    "1991 ; fabricant et al . 1991 ) , and it will be interesting to see whether the scatter of the early - type galaxies in the outer parts correlates with the butcher - oemler effect .",
    "if galaxies are accreted from the field , with a subsequent cutoff in their star formation rate , then the set of non - star forming galaxies in clusters evolves with time .",
    "hence the non - star forming galaxies at @xmath0 are a subsample of the non - star forming galaxies at @xmath7 , for the same cluster .",
    "this evolution makes it harder to compare samples of early - type cluster galaxies at different redshifts : at high redshift there will be an observational bias towards the oldest progenitors of present day early type galaxies .",
    "we calculate the importance of this effect by estimating the number of galaxies that will be added to the early - type galaxy population between @xmath0 and @xmath7 .",
    "the subsample that is consistent with continuous accretion ( the s0s in the outer parts of the cluster ) comprises about @xmath201 of the early - type galaxy population of cl1358 + 62 .",
    "this implies that the accretion rate must have decreased considerably since the onset of the formation of the cluster , which is consistent with theoretical predictions ( e.g. , lacey & cole 1993 , kauffmann 1995 ) .",
    "if we assume that the accretion rate remains constant after @xmath0 , we obtain an upper limit on the accreted and transformed fraction .",

    "the main uncertainty is the limited field of view of our data .",
    "the transformation rate is smaller when only bright galaxies are considered . as discussed in sect .",
    "[ bluegal.sec ] , the bluest galaxies have low luminosities .",
    "the most massive galaxies were therefore probably transformed into passively evolving systems at earlier times .",
    "it is difficult to add young bright galaxies to the cluster sample , even when we consider mergers .",
    "the merger of the two brightest galaxies that are more than 0.10 magnitudes bluer than the cm relation would produce a galaxy of @xmath204 .",
    "this galaxy would be placed among the brightest galaxies in cl1358 + 62 , but only for a short time .",
    "the luminosity of such a blue galaxy would be expected to fade by @xmath120 magnitudes , and the implication is that we have not ( yet ) observed the young progenitors of massive galaxies .",
    "we have studied the color - magnitude relation in the rich cluster cl1358 + 62 at @xmath0 .",
    "the elliptical galaxies in cl1358 + 62 form a very homogeneous population : the observed scatter in the @xmath1 cm relation is only @xmath130 magnitudes , and there is no evidence for an increase in the scatter with distance from the cluster center .",
    "we can not presently exclude a small ( @xmath205 magnitudes ) trend in the mean color of the ellipticals .",

    "the s0s in the outer parts of cl1358 + 62 are bluer by 0.02 magnitudes , and have a larger scatter than the s0s in the inner parts ( @xmath108 vs. @xmath107 ) .",

    "the morphologies of the mildly blue s0s are very similar to those of the red s0s ( cf .",
    "[ selgal.plot ] [ plate 4 ] ) .",
    "the very blue s0s generally have low luminosities .",
    "the systematic blueing of the cm relation with radius has been observed before ( in the cluster abell 2390 at @xmath206 , by abraham et al .",

    "we have constructed a range of models to explain the scatter in the cm relation of the ellipticals and the s0s in the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "we find that truncated continuous star formation models allow for more recent star formation than single burst models .",
    "the youngest ellipticals formed before @xmath155 if they formed in single bursts of star formation , and before @xmath6 if they experienced a constant star formation rate until an abrupt truncation . in all models , the youngest s0s in the outer parts of the cluster formed stars until close to the epoch of observation . in the truncated star formation model ,",
    "star formation in these galaxies continued until the epoch of observation .",
    "the radial trend of the s0 colors is consistent with the hypothesis that galaxies and groups are continuously accreted from the field . in this picture , the blue s0s are the galaxies that have been accreted recently .",
    "the star formation in the infalling galaxies is turned off upon entering the cluster .",
    "the truncation of the star formation may be accompanied by a small starburst in the nucleus ( e.g. , hernquist & mihos 1995 ) .",
    "this nuclear starburst would explain the blue bulges ( and the small color gradients ) that we see in many of the blue s0 galaxies ( cf .",
    "[ colgrad.sec ] ) .",
    "the accretion radius of the cluster is roughly @xmath11850minmpc ( carlberg , yee & ellingson 1997 ) , which is just outside our hst mosaic . if the morphological transformation between spirals and s0s occurs before accretion into the denser regions of the cluster , while the galaxies are still in small groups , that process probably occurs at radii beyond the limit of our observations .",
    "this might explain the small fraction of spirals in this very rich cluster .",
    "the continuous infall of field galaxies implies that the fraction of non - star forming galaxies in clusters evolves with time .",
    "this complicates the comparison between galaxy populations in high redshift clusters and local clusters .",
    "assuming a constant accretion rate after @xmath0 , we estimate that @xmath207% of the present - day early - type galaxy population in clusters has been added between @xmath0 and @xmath7 .",
    "we infer that the accretion rate was higher before @xmath0 , which is consistent with model predictions ( e.g. , kauffmann 1995 ) .",
    "the infall and transformation process seems to affect mostly the faint end of the galaxy population : the bluest galaxies have low luminosities .",
    "there are a few bright early - types with slightly bluer colors than the cm relation .",
    "their presence suggests that bright early - type galaxies with young populations may be found in clusters at higher redshifts .",
    "the homogeneity of the ellipticals and luminous s0s suggests that their star formation had ceased before they were accreted onto the cluster .",
    "there are several possible mechanisms , e.g. , the star formation may have ceased after the collapse of smaller subclumps ( galaxy groups ) in which the galaxies resided .",
    "studies of early - type galaxies in the field will be valuable to determine the process that shuts off the star formation in bright early - types before they enter the cluster environment .",
    "this study demonstrates the need for large field , high resolution observations of distant clusters .",
    "if only one hst wfpc2 pointing had been available , our conclusions would be quite different : inside @xmath208 , there is no systematic difference in the scatter or offset of the cm relation for the ellipticals and the s0s .",
    "additional wide field observations are needed to establish whether cl1358 + 62 is typical of intermediate @xmath147 clusters and to extend this study to higher redshifts .",
    "high quality data for nearby clusters extending over a wide field would also be valuable",
    ". it will be interesting to explore whether the differences between ellipticals and s0s , and the environmental dependence of the colors , are reflected in the fundamental plane of this cluster : the observed scatter of @xmath108 in the s0 colors in the outer parts implies a scatter in the fundamental plane in the @xmath44 band of @xmath28% in @xmath66 .",

    "<S> we study the color - magnitude ( cm ) relation as a function of radius in the cluster , to a limit of 4.6 arcmin from the center , equivalent to 1.6 50min mpc .    </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic scatter in the restframe @xmath1 cm relation of the elliptical galaxies is very small : @xmath20.022 magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the cm relation of the ellipticals does not depend significantly on the distance from the cluster center . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the cm relation for the s0 galaxies does depend on radius : the s0s in the core follow a cm relation similar to the ellipticals , but at large radii ( @xmath350minmpc ) the s0s are systematically bluer and the scatter in the cm relation approximately doubles to @xmath20.043 magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the blueing of the s0s at large radii is significant at the @xmath4% confidence level .    </S>",
    "<S> these results imply that the s0 galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster have formed stars more recently than the s0s in the inner parts . </S>",
    "<S> a likely explanation is that clusters at @xmath0 continue to accrete galaxies and groups from the field and that infall extinguishes star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the apparent homogeneity of the elliptical galaxy population implies that star formation in recently accreted ellipticals was terminated well before accretion occurred .    </S>",
    "<S> we have constructed models to explore the constraints that these observations place on the star formation history of cluster galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the best constrained parameter is the scatter in the luminosity - weighted age @xmath5 , which is less than 18% for the ellipticals and the s0s in the cluster core , and less than 35% for the s0s in the outer parts of the cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the constraints on the most recent period of star formation are model dependent , but we show that star formation in ellipticals likely ceased at @xmath6 or higher . if we assume that the galaxies have a constant star formation rate up to a randomly distributed truncation time , we find that the s0s in the outer parts of the cluster have experienced star formation until the epoch of observation at @xmath0 .    we conclude that the population of s0s in clusters is likely to evolve as star forming galaxies are converted into passively evolving galaxies . assuming a constant accretion rate after @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate @xmath215% of the present day early - type galaxy population in rich clusters was accreted between @xmath0 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the ellipticals ( and the brightest s0s ) are probably a more stable population , at least since @xmath6 .    </S>",
