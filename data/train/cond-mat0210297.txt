    "granular matter is a well known example of athermal systems ; it means systems where classical thermodynamics do not apply since thermal energy ( @xmath0 ) is insignificant compared to the gravitational energy of a macroscopic grain .",
    "a static packing of grains is therefore in a metastable state , indefinitely trapped in a local minimum of the total potential energy . when submitted to an external perturbation , the system instantaneously acquires an extra mechanical energy and then relaxes to a new metastable configuration , which depends on the previous one as well as on the nature of the perturbation .",
    "this dependence can be investigated by implementing at regular intervals identical external excitations on an assembly of grains and analyzing the succession of static metastable states explored by the system .",
    "this is a common experiment in pharmaceutics when compacting powders but it is also a practical way to `` thermalise '' a granular media and to test the conceptual connection between granular compaction and the very slow relaxations of out - of - equilibrium thermal systems @xcite .    the first experiments in this spirit have been carried out in chicago @xcite .",
    "starting from a loose packing of beads confined in a tube , a succession of vertical taps of controlled acceleration induces a progressive and very slow compaction of the system .",
    "this evolution is well fitted by the inverse of the logarithm of the number of taps and , after more than 10,000 taps , a hypothetic steady state is still not reached .",
    "these results have motivated many theorical and numerical works , most of them dealing with the notion of free volume and geometric constraint @xcite .",
    "some of them underscore structural aging effects , as currently noticed in glasses .    in this paper",
    ", we present new compaction experiments in what we believe to be more general conditions .",
    "indeed , the previous experiences @xcite were realized in a thin cylinder of diameter @xmath1 cm filled with monodisperse glass spheres of diameter @xmath2 , 2 , or 3 mm , that is to say a horizontal gap of 10 to 20 beads ( @xmath3 ) between the lateral walls .",
    "this condition allows a local measurement of the volume fraction with a capacitive method and prevents any convection in the packing .",
    "but , in return , the boundary effects are very strong and may be in particular responsible for the highest values of the volume fraction obtained in some chicago experiments@xcite , significantly above the random close packing limit ( approximately @xmath4 ) which corresponds to the maximal volume fraction in a disordered packing of identical hard spheres .",
    "our experimental setup is the following : a glass cylinder of diameter 10 cm , filled with 1 mm diameter glass beads on about 10 cm height , is shaken at regular intervals ( @xmath5 s ) by an electromagnetric exciter delivering vertical taps , each of them consisting of an entire cycle of a sine wave ( frequency @xmath6 hz ) .",
    "the negative peak acceleration @xmath7 felt by the whole system is measured by an accelerometer at the bottom of the cylinder so as to parametrize the tap intensity by the dimensionless acceleration @xmath8 . by measuring the absorption of a @xmath9-ray beam through the packing , it is possible to estimate the average volume fraction in the bulk @xmath10 as well as the vertical density profile @xmath11 , providing a local analysis of the packing structure .",
    "we can also deduce the mean potential energy of the heap : @xmath12 .",
    "+ to restrict the boundary effects , we use here a large horizontal gap ( @xmath13 ) even if , therefore , we allow convection to occur during the compaction of the beads , giving rise in particular to an instability of the horizontal free surface @xcite . in comparison with the previous experiments @xcite ,",
    "another important difference concerns the vertical pressure in the static packing : in the narrow tube used in chicago s set - up , the pressure felt by the heap at a given height does not correspond to the total weight of the upper packing ; part of this weight is screened by the lateral walls ( `` janssen effects '' ) . as a consequence , in a static configuration ,",
    "the vertical pressure is homogeneous in almost all the packing whereas , here , the vertical pressure is definitely not saturated in the packing but probably close to the hydrostatic pressure .",
    "nevertheless , we do not know to what extent the initial static situation can play a role in the dynamical process induced by a tap .",
    "the measure is deduced from the transmission ratio of the horizontal collimated @xmath9 beam through the packing : @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are respectively the activities counted on the detector with and without the presence of the beads in the cylinder . from the beer - lambert s law for absorption",
    ", we can derive an estimation of the volume fraction in the probe zone : @xmath17 .",
    "here @xmath18 is the absorption coefficient of the beads ; it was evaluated experimentally to @xmath19 for our @xmath9 beam of energy 662 @xmath20 ( @xmath21 source ) .",
    "the collimated @xmath9 beam is nearly cylindrical with a diameter of 10 mm and intercepts perpendicularly the vertical axis of the cylinder of beads .",
    "an acquisition - time of 60 seconds for each measure was found as a good consensus between the intrinsic uncertainty of the radioactive beam and the total duration of an experiment .",
    "we then achieve a precision @xmath22 .",
    "two types of measurement are used : vertical profile @xmath23 and mean volume fraction @xmath10 .",
    "the vertical volume fraction profile is deduced from 63 measures of the @xmath9-transmission at successive heights @xmath24 with a regular step @xmath25 mm ; each measure is an average on a horizontal slice obtained by 1 turn rotation of the cylinder about its axis during the measure .",
    "@xmath10 is estimated from the transmission ratio @xmath26 averaged on approximately 7 cm - height from the bottom of the cylinder : the cylinder achieves a vertical translation of 7 cm combinated to a rotation of 2 turns so as to permit a significant saving of time . with the aim of limiting the duration of the experiments and of avoiding redundant information due to the very slow evolution of the system ,",
    "the measurements are spaced out in time ( on a logarithmic scale ) with 2 measures of profile and 50 measures of @xmath10 per decade ( except 10 for the first decade ) .",
    "several compaction experiments were carried out for different values of the tapping strength @xmath27 in the range [ 0,6 ] .",
    "part of the results are presented in figure [ evolution ] which shows the evolution of the mean volume fraction @xmath28 and of the mean potential energy @xmath29 during 10,000 or 100,000 taps and for a few values of @xmath27 .",
    "these curves are either raw data or an average on 2 or 3 realizations . here",
    "we call `` time '' , @xmath30 , the number of taps and the `` dynamics '' is the succession of static equilibrium induced by the taps . @xmath31 and @xmath29 are plotted versus @xmath32 as a convenient way to include the initial state ( @xmath33 ) on the logarithmic axis .",
    "this initial state corresponds to a loose packing ( @xmath34 ) preparated in a reproductible way .",
    "the typical evolution is a slow compaction of the packing charaterised by an increase of @xmath31 and a reciprocal decrease of @xmath29 .",
    "then , after a varying relaxation time , the system finally reaches a steady - state . note that for @xmath35 , the temporal window accessible in the experiments becomes too small to observe the whole relaxation process ; but a compaction obviously occurs although @xmath27 is smaller than the `` dynamical '' threshold @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) above which there is a collective takeoff of the packing from the bottom of the cylinder .",
    "when reached , the final steady - state is all the more compact ( i.e. small value of @xmath38 and high value of @xmath39 ) as the tapping strength is slight ( see figure [ time]a ) ; but , in return , the number of taps needed increases significantly . in all our experiences , the volume fraction stays below the random close packing limit which tends to reject any hypothesis of ordering or crystallization in the packing .",
    "convection seems also to play a role in the compaction process : on figure [ time]a , we observe indeed a significant change in the dependance of @xmath40 with @xmath27 which might correspond to different convective regimes . under a threshold @xmath41",
    ", the final state of the free surface of the packing is an inclined plane and indicates a spontaneous breaking of symmetry . above @xmath42 ,",
    "the free surface heaps up moderately and finally takes a flat conical shape probably brought about by a nearly torical convective roll .",
    "these sorts of free surface instabilities have already been observed , see for instance @xcite .    in comparison with the previous experimental results @xcite , some sharp differences appear .",
    "first , the shapes of the compaction curves differ significantly , especially concerning the long time behavior and the obtaining of a final steady - state which is here definitely established and may correspond to a dynamical balance between compaction and convection",
    ". moreover , for a given intensity @xmath27 , the dynamics of the compaction seems slower in the chicago s experiments , particularly for the highest values of @xmath27 .",
    "we believe that these differences are principally due to the disparity of the lateral constraint ( horizontal gap @xmath43 ) in the two configurations ( @xmath3 against @xmath13 ) . to extend the comparison , we have tried to fit @xmath31 with the empirical law initially proposed in @xcite : @xmath44    the result is satisfactory concerning the beginning of a typical compaction curve but fails to correctly fit the final relaxation up to the steady - state . in particular , the parameter @xmath45 overestimates sharply the steady - state volume fraction @xmath39 at small @xmath27 . on contrary , our datas concerning @xmath31 as well as @xmath46 are in very good agreement with a stretched exponential function ( equation([kww ] ) ) on the whole temporal range .",
    "first used by kohlrausch in 1854 @xcite , this expression was far later popularized by williams and watts @xcite .",
    "it is now frequently applied to a large range of relaxations in disordered thermal systems as glasses ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) and is often called kww law . @xmath47    as @xmath48 can be approximated by @xmath49 and @xmath50 by @xmath51 , equation ( [ kww ] ) has only two free parameters ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 ) . examples of this fit are presented in figure [ evolution ] where the solid lines are the stretched exponential laws . for @xmath35 and",
    "more generally for @xmath54 , only the beginning of the relaxation is accessible and there is so no evidence that a stretched exponential law still describes the compaction dynamics ; consequently the corresponding fit is plotted in dotted line .",
    "the values obtained for @xmath53 are in the range @xmath55 and tend to increase slightly with @xmath27 whereas @xmath52 decreases strongly with @xmath27 .",
    "a general collapse of the compaction curves can be obtained by use of the function @xmath56 , defined as the rate of increase of @xmath31 : @xmath57 . figure [ collapse ] presents the plot of @xmath56 versus @xmath58 ; the solid line plots the kww fit .",
    "the fluctuations at large @xmath30 correspond to the final steady - state and are particularly significant at large @xmath27 .",
    "to quantify more precisely the influence of @xmath27 on the dynamics of the compaction , it is possible to estimate a characteristic relaxation time . to do this ,",
    "we use two different initial packings : the loose one , already presented above ( @xmath34 ) , and a more compact one ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "submitted to identical taps , the first packing densifies whereas the other dilates and both of them progressively meet , reaching the same steady - state . from this meeting point , we can evaluate a time of convergence @xmath60 .",
    "as most of the usual disordered packings of monodisperse beads have a packing fraction comprised between @xmath61 and @xmath62 , this time can also be regarded as a memory effect and can be interpreted as the number of taps required for a packing to `` forget '' its initial configuration .",
    "when analysing the dependance with @xmath27 of this characteristic time @xmath60 as well as of the parameter time @xmath63 of the stretched exponential fit , we found that an arrhenius behavior ( equation([tau ] ) ) describes reasonably well the experimental dynamics as illustrated in figure [ time]b : @xmath64 in the two cases , we have obtained ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) for @xmath60 and ( @xmath67 , @xmath68 ) for @xmath63 .    finally , we present in figure [ profils ] a typical evolution of the vertical volume fraction profile in the case of @xmath69 . to observe the progressive densification of the packing , we use a zoom on the zone of interest ( @xmath70 ) and a three - dimensional representation with the third axis corresponding to time on a logarithmic scale .",
    "the profile is plotted approximately every half - decade .",
    "we note that the compaction is rather homogeneous in the bulk ; there is no upward or downward densification front .",
    "the profile continuously reaches a final steady - state .",
    "this asymptotic profile is nearly uniform , a slight positive gradient ( @xmath71 ) appears for @xmath72 ; this observation agrees with previous experimental @xcite and numerical @xcite results .",
    "we have also verified that the same steady - state profile is obtained when starting from the initial dense packing ( @xmath73 ) instead of the loose one .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that , in the case where the lateral constraint is weak , granular compaction by vertical taps is quite similar to a typical relaxation of a out - of - equilibrium thermal system .",
    "indeed , the densification curves can be reasonably well fitted by a stretched exponential or kww law .",
    "the characteristic time of compaction ( @xmath74 or @xmath52 ) follows an arrhenius relation where the dimensionless acceleration @xmath27 plays the role of temperature .",
    "these results confirm and reinforce the analogy between compaction dynamics and `` glassy '' phenomena .",
    "moreover , the acquisition of the vertical volume fraction profile has established that the compaction is rather homogeneous in all the packing .",
    "further investigations are in progress to study more precisely the influence of the lateral constraint ( @xmath43 ) and to clarify the link between convection and compaction . +"
