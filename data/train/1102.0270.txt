    "topological states of matter have become a major topic in condensed matter theory and experiment .",
    "quite simple microscopic hamiltonians , e.g. those of fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) systems , are known to harbor emergent topological phases but often determining the correct effective low - energy theory is difficult : it becomes a delicate matter of energetics once one moves beyond idealized short ranged interactions .",
    "another way of idealizing interactions comes in the form of quantum lattice models . in recent years",
    "lattice models have become another , complementary source of topological phases .",
    "examples include the well - studied toric code model @xcite and the kitaev honeycomb model @xcite , which realizes the ising topological quantum field theory ( tqft ) in a controlled perturbative regime .",
    "a more general class of lattice models was introduced by levin and wen @xcite   turaev - viro \" @xcite in the math literature  which are rich sources of exactly solved achiral (  doubled \" ) theories .",
    "there is , however , a trade - off in using these models . in",
    "the exactly solved lw lattice models we know everything , but the hamiltonians look artificial : finely tuned , 12-body interactions without the comfort of familiar  kinetic \" and  potential \" terms . in fqh",
    "the hamiltonian is simple and natural , but the connection to the ( or several competing ) topological phases is not obvious .",
    "the motivation of this paper is the search for a middle ground where a simple local hamiltonian can be clearly identified with a unique topological phase .",
    "our chief innovation is to treat the lattice itself as a _ dynamic _ variable so that there is no fixed lattice underlying the hilbert space , hence the words  off lattice \" in the title .",
    "our search for this middle ground is presented as a travel log , with some surprises , disappointments , and discoveries . along the way we came to better appreciate what exactly a fixed lattice is good for and what adaptations its absence requires .",
    "briefly , a lattice model supplies two length scales , the lattice scale @xmath0 and the length of period @xmath1 , where topological protection comes from an error scaling : @xmath2 .",
    "protecting quantum information without this ratio of scales , e.g. when going off lattice , is a key challenge .",
    "levin - wen models place degrees of freedom (  labels \" ) on the edges of a trivalent graph dual to a fixed triangulation @xmath3 of a surface @xmath4 , where the labels come from a fusion category .",
    "the labeled graph is called a  string net \" .",
    "there is a mathematical fact encouraging us to leave the concept of a _ fixed _",
    "lattice behind .",
    "starting with a consistent @xmath5 symbol ( i.e. one obeying the pentagon relations ) for a fusion category @xmath6 and a closed surface @xmath4 , the vector space of admissibly labeled string nets on @xmath4 modulo isotopy and @xmath5 is canonically isomorphic to the lw ground state hilbert space @xmath7 built from a fixed dual triangulation .",
    "clearly ( [ fcat ] ) is a simpler starting point than the lw hamiltonian , but there is a serious problem : no single lattice ( we use the word ",
    "lattice \" here to mean the dual structure to a triangulation of @xmath4 ) will contain simultaneously bonds forming the  stick figures \" on both the left and right hand sides of ( [ fcat ] ) ; the @xmath5-move necessarily modifies the lattice .",
    "in fact the lw hamiltonian arises from a composition of such @xmath5-moves which  like a perturbation through excited states  begins and finally ends on the same lattice . for the honeycomb lattice ,",
    "the lw hamiltonian is a 12-body term , arising from 6 @xmath5-moves .",
    "our idea here is to construct an environment where the @xmath5-move itself may be written directly into the hamiltonian forcing the underlying lattice to fluctuate .",
    "this paper starts by reviewing the problems we encounter when going off - lattice in sec .",
    "[ sec : hazards ] and then present various ways to achieve off - lattice topological models in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] before concluding with a summary of the lessons learned from this off - lattice expedition in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the appendices contain a number of results that are interesting beyond the main subject of this paper . [",
    "appendix : spectrum ] proves a discrete version of cheeger s theorem appropriate graphs with weights on edges and vertices extending work of chung @xcite .",
    "we use it to derive bounds on the gaps of graph laplacians and other local hamiltonians .",
    "[ appendix : outerplanar ] derives an upper bound for the scaling of the gap of the graph laplacian on outer planar triangulations , following an idea developed with oded schramm .",
    "[ appendix : c ] presents exact results for an off - lattice version of the toric code model , and finally [ appendix : numerics ] presents numerical results for the gap of the graph laplacian and cheeger s constant for trees , triangulations of the sphere and outer planar triangulations .",
    "let us begin by cataloging three hazards which await us off - lattice .",
    "the first hazard is well known in euclidean quantum gravity .",
    "it is called `` minbus '' or `` baby universe '' @xcite .",
    "it refers to the fact that if a triangulation ( or any other polyhedral decomposition ) is chosen uniformly at random for a sphere ( or other closed surface of fixed genus @xmath8 ) among all triangulations of a fixed number @xmath9 of triangles , it is likely that there will be a short dual loop containing numerous vertices on both sides ( or in the case of surfaces with @xmath10 there will also be short nonseparating loops ) .",
    "we measure the length of a ( dual ) loop simply as the number of edges it crosses .",
    "this can be formalized by saying that cheeger s",
    "@xcite isoperimetric constant @xmath11 when @xmath12 , almost always @xmath13},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the components of the surface @xmath4 minus @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the number of vertices ( or sites ) in @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .    it is known that typically a triangulated sphere has @xmath19 .",
    "there is in fact an asymptotic formula @xcite for the number @xmath20 of isomorphically distinct divisions of a closed genus @xmath8 surface into squares with the condition that the dual graph has no odd cycles : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the euler number .",
    "it is only a simplifying technicality to treat these quadrangulations rather than triangulations  similar asymptotics should apply but with 12 replaced by some other less convenient base ; the @xmath23 is universal .    an easy application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nd ] ) ( we thank gilles schaeffer for bringing this to our attention ) is that it is possible to estimate the fraction @xmath24 of genus @xmath8 surfaces that are divided by a separating curve of length four into surfaces of genus @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "the method is to remove a random square from random surfaces of @xmath25 and @xmath26 , glue the results together and count how many ways this is possible as a fraction of surfaces of genus @xmath28 .",
    "the result is : @xmath29    to summarize : constant size bottle necks are algebraically likely and logarithmic bottlenecks are virtually assured .",
    "this appears to be very unfavorable for the protection of topological information .",
    "when working with lattice models , we are used to error rates appropriate to tunneling problems like @xmath30 , where @xmath1 is the linear dimension of the lattice as a multiple of the lattice constant .",
    "if bottlenecks reduce @xmath1 to constant or even logarithmic size , the protection disappears .",
    "this is the first issue to come to terms with when considering uniformly random triangluations ( urt ) .",
    "for quite a different reason , these bottlenecks and baby universes have been unwelcome also in quantum gravity .",
    "there one seeks a hamiltonian function on triangulation which concentrates near euclidean flat space but still allows a liquid of possible universes .",
    "forty years of effort have failed to find such a phase even in dimension 2 ( at least in the homogeneous setting ) , for a review see @xcite .",
    "it is possible to form a `` branching polymer universe '' of hausdorff dimension @xmath31 , to perturb about a single rigid euclidean crystal , or a `` collapsed phase '' of infinite hausdorff dimension , but a nearly flat , yet liquid , phase , or even a critical point , has been elusive",
    ". however , in the last dozen years progress has been made by breaking the symmetry between space and time and allowing only triangulations appropriately foliated by space - like leaves @xcite .",
    "the approach is called `` causal dynamical triangulation '' ( cdt ) and has been shown numerically to provide `` birth control '' @xcite  there are parameter regimes , called the  c phase \" , with no baby universes in which the space - like leaves are on average nearly euclidean of the desired dimension . in section 2.3",
    "we describe an approach to building a @xmath32 dimensional model for a 2 + 1-dimensional anyonic system in which the 2 spatial dimensions are broken into a 1 + 1 pair to exploit the favorable statistical geometry of 1 + 1 cdts .",
    "the second issue with urt is the mixing time .",
    "we analytically estimated the cheeger isoperimetric constant @xmath33 in a toy model of surface triangulations called `` outer planar '' triangulations . in this context",
    "we show analytically @xmath34 , whereas in our numerical study ( presented in [ appendix : n - gons ] ) the first eigenvalue @xmath35 of the graph laplacian ( the `` graph '' has vertices outer plane triangulations and edges plaquette flips between these ) goes like @xmath36 ( this translates to the first eigenvalue @xmath37 of the graph incidence matrix scaling like @xmath38 since @xmath39 in our models and [ appendix : numerics ] . ] ) .",
    "cheeger like inequalities show ( see [ appendix : spectrum ] ) : @xmath40 or @xmath41 we believe the truth is near the high end @xmath42 , and that on the sphere @xmath43 .    as a further probe of the spectrum",
    ", we studied the dynamics of string nets on the 2-sphere ( see [ appendix : numericssphere ] ) and also observed a mixing time @xmath44 , i.e. @xmath45 , and @xmath46 .",
    "string nets are dual to triangulations but slightly more flexible , e.  g. a closed loop in a string net is permitted whereas the usual definition of triangulation does not permit a triangle to be glued to itself .",
    "all this confirms the findings of the quantum gravity community : the space of random triangulations , quadrangulations , string nets , etc . on a surface",
    "will mix algebraically fast but not so fast ( which would need to be @xmath47 ) so that the @xmath37 first eigenvalue of the incidence matrix is gapped or , equivalently , that the cheeger constant @xmath48 ( of the graph - of - triangulations ) is bounded away from zero .",
    "a third problem was noticed when we studied multi loops on a periodic honeycomb lattice .",
    "the chosen dynamics is that of the toric code @xcite , however , we made the convention that if two multi loops were isotopic , deformable one to the other , then they would be identified and represented by a single ket . in [ appendix : c ] , we present data which shows that the trivial winding sector can easily be picked out from the other three by a `` local '' observation  we count the number of `` leaves ''  that is loops with no smaller loops within .",
    "in retrospect , this is no surprise .",
    "being in the trivial sector allows the possibility of no essential loops whatever  this possibility permits more space on the lattice for leaves .",
    "local distinguishability is , of course , the death knell of topological protection .",
    "a state which can be observed locally can be acted on by a local operator .",
    "this is a third disturbing finding if we grant that leaves are to be considered local structures . since metrical notions have been temporarily banished , it is up to our intuition to reformulate the appropriate meaning of  local opeator . \"",
    "leaf detection has , in this context , as good of a claim to being local as does any operator .      of the three problems , ( 2 ) is the least concerning .",
    "even if there are low energy metrical fluctuations ( one may dub them  gravity waves \" ) , they appear decoupled from topological degrees of freedom which can be encoded on each lattice . with respect to problems ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) , there is a somewhat solipsistic solution to the apparent loss of topological protection from ( 1 ) bottlenecks and ( 3 ) variations in leaf count .",
    "it is simply to deny that this is a problem .",
    "once kets of the hilbert space are isotopy classes ( of triangulations or nets  perhaps together with a particle type labelling of the bonds ) we have lost direct contact with any notion of a position coordinate @xmath49 .",
    "isotopy slides and stretches , so we no longer know what is long or short or even where we are .",
    "this viewpoint leads one to say there are no local operators at all and therefore topological protection  protection against local operations  is tautological . but",
    "such a view comes with a heavy price  without a position coordinate @xmath49 correlation functions loose meaning and contact with the condensed matter notions disappears .",
    "consequently we will not take this path but rather consider three distinct approaches all of which enforce flat euclidean space as the background , but in quite different ways and with quite different results .    in summary",
    ", we find that there are plausible and even intriguing ways to model topological phases off lattice",
    ". the next step should be to identify a case where the model variables can be mapped to electron degrees of freedom .",
    "topological phases of lattice models are known in the physics literature from levin and wen @xcite and in the math literature from turaev and viro @xcite .",
    "we explore what happens in taking such a model `` off lattice '' by including the underlying cell structure or `` lattice '' among the dynamic variables .",
    "thus , our hilbert space @xmath50 will be spanned by kets which are pairs @xmath51 where @xmath3 is a triangulation of the surface @xmath4 with @xmath9 ( fixed ) triangles and @xmath14 is a `` labeling '' of the dual edges of @xmath3 .",
    "we can equally well focus on the dual string net and its variations , some of which may not be dual to actual triangulations .",
    "it is the dual edges which form our so - called lattice , e.g.  the dual edges form a honeycomb if @xmath3 is the standard triangulation of the plane by equilateral triangles .",
    "the labels are from a pivotal fusion category .",
    "two interesting examples are with label set \\{1 , @xmath52 } of the fibonacci theory fib and fusion rule @xmath53 , which when applied as labels on string nets yields the theory dfib @xcite , or with label set @xmath54 and fusion rule @xmath55 , which gives the toric code @xcite . rather than speaking in generalities ,",
    "we give our constructions in the former case .",
    "they are easily extended to the broader class .    in moving off lattice",
    "we can be timid or bold but as we have argued we must find some way to tie our lattices to the euclidian plane .",
    "our hamiltonian can charge energy for defects in a base lattice , say the honeycomb , or it can treat all triangulations equally .",
    "there is , of course , an adjustable parameter connecting large to zero energy penalty for defects .",
    "however , decades of experience with 2d quantum gravity ( qg ) models suggest that there is a single phase transition from a phase with amplitudes clustered near the original honeycomb ( we call this crystalline ) and a liquid of lattices whose geometry is almost surely `` cactus shaped ''  cheeger constant @xmath56 . in the quantum gravity community the lack of an intermediated phase was the cause of some despair , the cactus buds being called `` baby universes . '' as we remarked in the introduction , this problem may have been solved in the quantum gravity context @xcite by introducing an appropriate causal structure .",
    "this is explored in section 2.3 , where 3d space is split into a radial  space \" coordinate @xmath57 and a periodic  pseudo - time \" coordinate @xmath58 .",
    "but if one insists that 2d space be treated homogenously , then the baby universes must be faced .",
    "we will do this but first let us explore moving only timidly off the honeycomb .",
    "there we find a gapped model which is conceptually very simple ( we think more simple than the lw model ) but the price of our timidness is that the gap is absurdly small , perhaps @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the energy scale of the individual terms . in spite of the disappointingly small gap",
    ", we next explain this model as it is a nice , controlled context for stepping ",
    "ever so slightly  off lattice .",
    "a bolder step will be taken later .",
    "our first hamiltonian has the form @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 acts on the direct sum of fibers of a bundle of states over the moduli space of string nets ( thought of as metrics ) on @xmath4 , say a torus .",
    "the terms of @xmath63 are of two types :    1 .",
    "fusion constraints ; these are projectors acting within fibers 2 .   @xmath5-moves ; these act between adjacent fibers    the fibers are degrees of freedom on the edge set of any given string net .",
    "@xmath5-moves define a connection linking these fibers together which , because of the pentagon relation , trivialize the subbundle satisfying fusion constraints .",
    "the term @xmath64 is an energy penalty which charges energy @xmath65 for each pair of ( 5-gon , 7-gon ) pairs created by an @xmath5-move ( see figure 2.4a ) .",
    "the number of such defects is counted by the operator @xmath66 .",
    "the expected levin - wen 12-body plaquette term is _ not _ directly included but we will show that it arises at high order by considering the process which virtually breaks a @xmath52-labeled string , resulting in a pair of  electric \" excitations or @xmath67 . ] costing energy @xmath68 , see @xcite .",
    "we consider two triangulations @xmath3 and @xmath69 ( and their dual nets ( or `` lattices '' ) @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) to be equivalent if they are isotopic on @xmath4 , i.e. if we can slide one to the other .",
    "later , we set @xmath65 to zero to obtain a lattice liquid , then add a string tension term and also tie each net to @xmath4 in a fixed way ( unrestricted isotopy will no longer be permitted ) ; but for now we study the crystalline case and need not distinguish isotopic nets . the dynamics on the set of nets",
