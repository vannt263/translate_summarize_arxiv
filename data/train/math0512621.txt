    "although functorial , is not necessarily an equivalence ( nor , strictly speaking , does it necessarily involve the representation category of a _ quantum group _ ; this often has to be replaced by a quasitensor category  @xcite that is not the representation category of any quantum group ) .",
    "`` deviations '' from the equivalence typically occur in _ rational _ conformal field theories  @xcite .",
    "a class of conformal field theory models where the kazhdan  lusztig correspondence is an equivalence is given by the @xmath2 logarithmic models .",
    "this remarkable property may be attributed to the fact that the @xmath2 models are not logarithmic _ extensions _ of minimal conformal field theory models , simply because the latter are nonexistent . in the @xmath2 model ,",
    "the representation category is nonsemisimple , and establishing the kazhdan  lusztig correspondence does not therefore require a special `` semisimplification '' of the representation category of the quantum group . for recent advances in the study of vertex - operator algebras with nonsemisimple representation categories ,",
    "see  @xcite and the references therein and in  @xcite .    in the @xmath2 logarithmic models ,",
    "the vertex - operator algebra is the triplet @xmath0-algebra @xmath1 `` based on the @xmath9 operator ''  @xcite , and the kazhdan  lusztig - dual quantum group is @xmath4 , the restricted quantum @xmath10 at @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1  algebra and the @xmath4 quantum group have the same number ( @xmath11 ) of irreducible representations and identical fusion rings ( the grothendieck ring for the quantum group ) .",
    "the results in  @xcite suggest that the quasitensor categories of @xmath1- and @xmath4-representations are in fact equivalent .    in this paper",
    ", we prove the equivalence in the most explicit case of @xmath7 .",
    "the proof extends to the general @xmath12 , but requires more technical details , which will be given elsewhere .",
    "the general strategy is to construct a bimodule ( a right @xmath4-module and a left @xmath1-module ) that decomposes into projective modules from each side and therefore establishes the equivalence of the two representation categories . for @xmath7 ,",
    "this construction is quite simple because the relevant vertex operators are `` almost local '' with respect to each other .    by the equivalence , which we assume to hold for any @xmath12",
    ", the study of a category of @xmath1-representations can be replaced by the study of the category of finite - dimensional @xmath4-representations .",
    "these are not difficult to classify using the standard means  @xcite ; we show that apart from the projective modules , all indecomposable representations are enumerated in terms of indecomposable representations of the kronecker quiver and can easily be constructed explicitly ; there are four series labeled by @xmath13 and two series labeled by @xmath14 . in accordance with the equivalence",
    ", this classification also applies to @xmath1-representations ; finding their classification directly would be a much more difficult problem .",
    "the equivalence of categories leads to other identifications between `` conformal field theory data '' and `` quantum - group data , '' the most prominent one being the identification of the respective _",
    "centers_. the center @xmath15 of a conformal field theory model",
    " endomorphisms of the identity functor in the representation category of the corresponding vertex - operator algebra  @xmath16contains `` highly nonlocal '' operators ( the ishibashi states ) . a basis in the center",
    "is naturally constructed in terms of conformal blocks on a torus . in the semisimple case ,",
    "@xmath15 coincides with the space of conformal field theory characters , but in logarithmic models , it is not exhausted by the characters ( cf .",
    "this has been studied recently within different approaches  @xcite .",
    "the general approach to finding the missing `` extended characters '' via the construction of pseudo - traces for a class of vertex - operator algebras with nonsemisimple representation category was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the extended characters , along with the usual ones , are solutions of certain differential equations  @xcite .",
    "when the kazhdan  lusztig correspondence establishes the equivalence between representation categories of a vertex - operator algebra and a quantum group , @xmath15 is canonically identified with the _ center  @xmath17 of the quantum group_. moreover , in the @xmath2 models at least , this identification between @xmath15 and  @xmath17 extends to modular - group representations : the @xmath18-representation on @xmath15 induced by the @xmath19 and @xmath20 transformations is equivalent  @xcite to the @xmath18-action on the quantum group center  @xmath17 , defined in quite general terms of ribbon braided tensor categories  @xcite .",
    "the actual identification of @xmath15 with @xmath17 yields a remarkable relation @xmath21 where  @xmath22 is the ribbon element ( belonging to the quantum group center ) and @xmath23 is the zero - mode of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath8-matrix associated with the kazhdan  lusztig - dual quantum group  @xmath24 can be identified with the braiding matrix in conformal field theory , its action on vertex operators following from the construction of  @xmath24 in terms of screening and contour - removal operators .",
    "itself is _ not _ quasitriangular ( does not have a universal @xmath8-matrix ) , at least in the known examples of logarithmic @xmath2  @xcite and @xmath25 models . but the universal @xmath8-matrix exists for a somewhat larger quantum group , generated by the generators of @xmath24 _ and _ the square root @xmath26 of the cartan generator @xmath27 in @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath28 . in conformal field theory ,",
    "the counterpart of the ambiguity in defining @xmath29 is the ambiguity in choosing the direction of contours along which operators are permuted .",
