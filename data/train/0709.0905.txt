    "the study of water waves is a fascinating subject because the phenomena are familiar and the mathematical problems are various cf . @xcite . due to the relative intractability of the governing equations for water waves in regard to inferring from their direct study qualitative or quantitative conclusions about the propagation of waves at the water s surface , from the earliest days in the development of hydrodynamics many competing models",
    "were suggested . until the second half of the 20th century , the study of water waves was confined almost exclusively to linear theory @xcite .",
    "while linearisation gives insight for small perturbations on water initially at rest , its applicability fails for waves that are not small perturbations of a flat water surface .",
    "for example , linear water wave theory gives no insight into the study of phenomena which are manifestations of genuine nonlinear behaviour , like breaking waves breaking and solitary waves @xcite .",
    "many nonlinear models for water waves have been suggested to capture the existence of solitary water waves and the associated phenomenon of soliton manifestation @xcite .",
    "the most prominent example is the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation @xcite , the only member of the wider family of bbm - type equations @xcite that is integrable and relevant for the phenomenon of soliton manifestation @xcite .",
    "another development of models for water waves was initiated in order to gain insight into wave breaking , one of the most fundamental aspects of water waves for which there appears to be no satisfactory mathematical theory @xcite . starting from the observation that the strong dispersive effect incorporated into the kdv model prevents wave breaking , whitham ( see the discussion in @xcite ) initiated the quest for equations that are simpler than the governing equations for water waves and which could model breaking waves .",
    "the physical validity of the first proposed models is questionable but two recently derived nonlinear integrable equations , the camassa - holm equation @xcite and the degasperis - procesi equation @xcite , possess smooth solutions that develop singularities in finite time via a process that captures the essential features of breaking waves cf .",
    "@xcite : the solution remains bounded but its slope becomes unbounded . our aim is to prove the relevance of these two equations as models for the propagation of shallow water waves , proving that both are valid approximations to the governing equations for water waves . in our investigation",
    "we put earlier ( formal ) asymptotic procedures due to johnson @xcite on a firm and mathematically rigorous basis .",
    "we also investigate in what sense these two models give us insight into the wave breaking phenomenon by some simple numerical computations .",
    "for one dimensional surfaces , the water waves equations read , in nondimensionalized form , @xmath0 where @xmath1 parameterizes the elevation of the free surface at time @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the fluid domain delimited by the free surface and the flat bottom @xmath4 , and where @xmath5 ( defined on @xmath6 ) is the velocity potential associated to the flow ( that is , the two - dimensional velocity field @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 ) .",
    "finally , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two dimensionless parameters defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mean depth , @xmath13 is the typical amplitude and @xmath14 the typical wavelength of the waves under consideration . making assumptions on the respective size of @xmath9 and @xmath10 ,",
    "one is led to derive ( simpler ) asymptotic models from ( [ ww ] ) .",
    "+ in the shallow - water scaling ( @xmath15 ) , one can derive the so - called green - naghdi equations ( see @xcite for the derivation , and @xcite for a rigorous justification ) , without any assumption on @xmath9 ( that is , @xmath16 ) .",
    "for one dimensional surfaces and flat bottoms , these equations couple the free surface elevation @xmath17 to the vertically averaged horizontal component of the velocity , @xmath18 and can be written as @xmath19_x=0\\\\      u_t+\\zeta_x+{\\varepsilon}u u_x = \\frac{\\mu}{3}\\frac{1}{1+{\\varepsilon}\\zeta }      \\big[(1+{\\varepsilon}\\zeta)^3(u_{xt}+{\\varepsilon}u u_{xx}-{\\varepsilon}u_x^2)\\big]_x ,      \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath20 terms have been discarded .",
    "+ if we make the _ additionnal _ assumption that @xmath21 , then the above system reduces at first order to a wave equation of speed @xmath22 and any perturbation of the surface splits up into two components moving in opposite directions .",
    "a natural issue is therefore to describe more accurately the motion of these two `` unidirectional '' waves . in the so - called long - wave regime",
    "@xmath23 korteweg and de vries @xcite found that , say , the right - going wave should satisfy the kdv equation @xmath24 ( and @xmath25 ) , which at leading order reduces to the expected transport equation at speed @xmath26 .",
    "more recently , it has been noticed by benjamin , bona , mahoney @xcite that the kdv equation belongs to a wider class of equations ( the bbm equations , first used by peregrine @xcite and sometimes also called the regularized long - wave equations ) which provide an approximation of the exact water waves equations of the same accuracy as the kdv equation : @xmath27 the equations ( [ bbm ] ) contain both nonlinear effects ( the @xmath28 term ) and dispersive effects ( the @xmath29and @xmath30 terms ) due to the scaling ( [ scalinglw ] ) . however , these equations do not account correctly for large amplitude waves , whose behavior is more nonlinear than dispersive . for such waves , characterized by larger values of @xmath9 , it is natural to investigate the following scaling ( which we call camassa - holm scaling ) :",
    "@xmath31 with this scaling , one still has @xmath21 and thus the same reduction to a simple wave equation at leading order ; the dimensionless parameter is however larger here than in the long wave scaling , and the nonlinear effects are therefore stronger .",
    "in particular , a stronger nonlinearity could allow the appearance of breaking waves - a fundamental phenomenon in the theory of water waves that is not captured by the bbm equations .",
    "we show in this paper that the correct generalization of the bbm equations ( [ bbm ] ) under the scaling ( [ scalingch ] ) is provided by the following class of equations : @xmath32 ( with some conditions on @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) .",
    "+ notice that for an equation of the family ( [ chfamily ] ) to be well - posed it is necessary that @xmath37 , as one can see by analyzing the linear part via fourier transforms .",
    "we want to insist on the fact that ( [ chfamily ] ) provides an approximation of the same order @xmath20 as the bbm equations ( [ bbm ] ) to the green - naghdi equations .",
    "the only difference in the derivation of these equations lies in the different scalings ( [ scalinglw ] ) and ( [ scalingch ] ) . since of course @xmath38 when @xmath10 is small , the long - wave scaling ( [ scalinglw ] ) is contained in the ch scaling ( [ scalingch ] ) , and consequently , the bbm equations can be recovered as a specialization of ( [ chfamily ] ) when @xmath39 and not only @xmath40 .      among the various type of equations ( [ chfamily ] ) with @xmath37",
    "there are only two with a bi - hamiltonian structure : the camassa - holm and the degasperis - procesi equations @xcite .",
    "notice that while the kdv equation has a bi - hamiltonian structure ( see @xcite ) , this is not the case for the other members of the bbm family of equations ( [ bbm ] ) .",
    "the importance of a bi - hamiltonian structure lies in the fact that in general it represents the hallmark of a completely integrable hamiltonian system whose solitary wave solutions are solitons , that is , localized waves that recover their shape and speed after interacting nonlinearly with another wave of the same type ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the camassa - holm ( ch ) equations are usually written under the form @xmath41 with @xmath42 .",
    "a straightforward scaling argument shows that if @xmath43 , ( [ cheq ] ) can be written under the form ( [ chfamily ] ) by setting @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 ( which requires @xmath49 and leads to @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "this motivates the following definition :    [ defich ] we say that ( [ chfamily ] ) is a camassa - holm equation if the following conditions hold : @xmath52 for all @xmath43 , the solution @xmath53 to ( [ chfamily ] ) is transformed into a solution @xmath54 to ( [ cheq ] ) by the transformation @xmath55 with @xmath56 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "first derived as a bi - hamiltonian system by fokas & fuchssteiner @xcite , the equation ( [ cheq ] ) gained prominence after camassa - holm @xcite independently re - derived it as an approximation to the euler equations of hydrodynamics and discovered a number of the intriguing properties of this equation . in @xcite a lax pair formulation of ( [ cheq ] ) was found , a fact which lies at the core of showing via direct and inverse scattering @xcite that ( [ cheq ] ) is a completely integrable hamiltonian system : for a large class of initial data , solving ( [ cheq ] ) amounts to integrating an infinite number of linear first - order ordinary differential equations which describe the evolution in time of the action - angle variables .",
    "the camassa - holm equations shares with kdv this integrability property as well as the fact that its solitary waves are solitons @xcite . we refer to @xcite for a discussion of these properties in the context of the kdv model .",
    "the degasperis - procesi ( dp ) equations are usually written under the form @xmath57 with @xmath42 .",
    "the same scaling arguments as for the ch equation motivate the following definition :    [ defidp ] we say that ( [ chfamily ] ) is a degasperis - procesi equation if the following conditions hold : @xmath58 for all @xmath43 , the solution @xmath53 to ( [ chfamily ] ) is transformed into a solution @xmath54 to ( [ dpeq ] ) by the transformation @xmath55 with @xmath59 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "equation ( [ dpeq ] ) , first derived in @xcite , is also known to have a lax pair formulation @xcite and its solitary waves interact like solitons @xcite . just like the kdv equation",
    "( see @xcite ) and the camassa - holm equation ( see @xcite ) , the degasperis - procesi equation has infinitely many integrals of motion .",
    "in addition to the properties of ( [ cheq ] ) and ( [ dpeq ] ) mentioned before , the importance of these two equations is enhanced by their relevance to the modeling of wave breaking , one of the most important but mathematically still quite elusive phenomena encountered in the study of water waves .    [ defibreaking ]",
    "we say that there is wave breaking for an equation of the form ( [ chfamily ] ) , if there exists a time @xmath60 and solutions @xmath53 to ( [ chfamily ] ) such that @xmath61\\times{\\mathbb r } )      \\quad\\mbox { and } \\quad      \\lim_{t\\to",
    "t^{{\\varepsilon},\\mu}}\\vert { \\partial_x}u(t,\\cdot)\\vert_{\\infty}=\\infty.\\ ] ]    the rationale of this definition is that if the flow velocity @xmath53 is to first order a good approximation to the surface profile @xmath17 , it is then reasonable to expect that the above blow - up pattern has a similar counterpart in terms of @xmath17 .",
    "if this were the case , the boundedness of the wave height in combination with an unbounded slope captures the main features of a breaking wave @xcite .    for kdv in particular , as well as for any other member of the bbm family ( [ bbm ] ) , all smooth initial data @xmath62 decaying at infinity develop into solutions defined for all times ( see e.g. @xcite ) so that the bbm family @xcite does not model wave breaking @xcite .",
    "to remedy this shortcoming of the kdv equation whitham proposed to formally replace the dispersive term @xmath29 by a convolution with a singular function chosen so that the newly obtained equation presents wave breaking ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this formal process destroys the integrability and soliton features of the kdv equation .",
    "in contrast to this , both ( [ cheq ] ) and ( [ dpeq ] ) admit breaking waves in the sense of definition [ defibreaking ] cf .",
    "@xcite for ( [ cheq ] ) and @xcite for ( [ dpeq ] ) . in this paper",
    "we explore the wave breaking phenomenon for both equations not in the restricted sense provided by definition [ defibreaking ] but by studying the nonlinear equation describing the evolution in time of the free surface .",
    "while our results vindicate the fact that it is appropriate to use in this context definition [ defibreaking ] to describe breaking waves , there is a slight twist . to be more precise ,",
    "let us distinguish between two types of breaking waves that can be observed .",
    "in a plunging breaker the slope of the wave approaches @xmath63 at the breaking location as we reach breaking time , while in a surging breaker the slope becomes @xmath64 .",
    "considering the case of the camassa - holm equation ( [ cheq ] ) , due to the fact that singularities in a smooth solution can appear only if @xmath65 as we approach breaking time while @xmath66 remains uniformly bounded ( see @xcite ) , we would expect to observe a plunging breaker at the free surface .",
    "however , as we recall here , the camassa - holm equation describes the behavior of the vertically averaged horizontal component of the velocity @xmath53 ; the free surface elevation @xmath17 can be given in terms of @xmath53 ( @xmath67 , see proposition [ prop1 ] below ) but such an asymptotic expression of course breaks down when @xmath68 becomes singular , and can not be used to describe the behavior of the free surface when there is `` wave breaking '' for the velocity .",
    "since `` wave breaking '' is a very intuitive notion when it refers to the free surface elevation , we show in this article that it is possible to revert the usual approach ; that is , we derive an evolution equation for the surface elevation @xmath17 and give an asymptotic expression for the velocity @xmath53 in terms of @xmath17 ( cf .",
    " [ sectsurf ] ) .",
    "this allows us to prove that wave breaking indeed occurs for the surface elevation but that , as opposed to what happens for the velocity , this is a surging breaker ! the difference between plunging and surging breakers is graphically illustrated by numerical computations in  [ numerics ] .",
    "we derive here asymptotical equations to the green - naghdi equations in the camassa - holm scaling ( [ scalingch ] ) .",
    "we recall that the green - naghdi equations are given by @xmath69_x=0\\\\      u_t+\\zeta_x+{\\varepsilon}u u_x = \\frac{\\mu}{3}\\frac{1}{1+{\\varepsilon}\\zeta }      \\big[(1+{\\varepsilon}\\zeta)^3(u_{xt}+{\\varepsilon}u u_{xx}-{\\varepsilon}u_x^2)\\big]_x .",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] since we work under the camassa - holm scaling , we restrict our attention to values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 satisfying @xmath70 for some @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "equations for the velocity @xmath53 ( including the ch and dp equations ) are first derived in  [ sectvel ] , and equations for the surface elevation @xmath17 are obtained in  [ sectsurf ] .",
    "the considerations we make on the derivation of these equations are related to the approach initiated by johnson @xcite , approach that is substantiated and extended by our analysis .",
    "in addition , we explore the wave breaking phenomenon .",
    "at leading order , the green - naghdi equations degenerate into a simple wave equation of speeds @xmath22 ; including the @xmath73 terms , one can easily check that the ( say ) right - going component of the wave must satisfy @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
