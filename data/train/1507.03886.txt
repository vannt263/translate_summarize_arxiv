    "while sports are often analogized to a wide array of other arenas of human activity  particularly war  well known story lines and elements of sports are conversely invoked to describe other spheres .",
    "each game generates a probablistic , rule - based story  @xcite , and the stories of games provide a range of motifs which map onto narratives found across the human experience : dominant , one - sided performances ; back - and - forth struggles ; underdog upsets ; and improbable comebacks . as fans , people enjoy watching suspenseful sporting events  unscripted stories  and following the fortunes of their favorite players and teams  @xcite .    despite the inherent story - telling nature of sporting contests  and notwithstanding the vast statistical analyses surrounding professional sports including the many observations of and departures from randomness  @xcite  the ecology of game stories remains a largely unexplored , data - rich area  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in a number of basic questions such as whether the game stories of a sport form a spectrum or a set of relatively isolated clusters , how well models such as random walks fare in reproducing the specific shapes of real game stories , whether or not these stories are compelling to fans , and how different sports compare in the stories afforded by their various rule sets .    here , we focus on australian rules football , a high skills game originating in the mid 1800s .",
    "we describe australian rules football in brief and then move on to extracting and evaluating the sport s possible game stories .",
    "early on , the game evolved into a winter sport quite distinct from other codes such as soccer or rugby while bearing some similarity to gaelic football",
    ". played as state - level competitions for most of the 1900s with the victorian football league ( vfl ) being most prominent , a national competition emerged in the 1980s with the australian football league ( afl ) becoming a formal entity in 1990 . the afl is currently constituted by 18 teams located in five of australia s states .",
    "games run over four quarters , each lasting around 30 minutes ( including stoppage time ) , and teams are each comprised of 18 on - field players . games ( or matches ) are played on large ovals typically used for cricket in the summer and of variable size ( generally 135 to 185 meters in length ) .",
    "the ball is oblong and may be kicked or handballed ( an action where the ball is punched off one hand with the closed fist of the other ) but not thrown . marking ( cleanly catching a kicked ball ) is a central feature of the game , and the afl is well known for producing many spectacular marks and kicks for goals  @xcite .",
    "the object of the sport is to kick goals , with the customary standard of highest score wins ( ties are relatively rare but possible ) .",
    "scores may be 6 points or 1 point as follows , some minor details aside .",
    "each end of the ground has four tall posts . kicking the ball ( untouched ) through the central two posts results in a ` goal ' or 6 points .",
    "if the ball is touched or goes through either of the outer two sets of posts , then the score is a ` behind ' or 1 point .",
    "final scores are thus a combination of goals ( 6 ) and behinds ( 1 ) and on average tally around 100 per team .",
    "poor conditions or poor play may lead to scores below 50 , while scores above 200 are achievable in the case of a ` thrashing ' ( the record high and low scores are 239 and 1 ) .",
    "wins are worth 4 points , ties 2 points , and losses 0 .    of interest to us here",
    "is that the afl provides an excellent test case for extracting and describing the game story space of a professional sport .",
    "we downloaded 1,310 afl game scoring progressions from http://www.afltables.com[http://afltables.com ] ( ranging from the 2008 season to midway through the 2014 season )  @xcite .",
    "we extracted the scoring dynamics of each game down to second level resolution , with the possible events at each second being ( 1 ) a goal for either team , ( 2 ) a behind for either team , or ( 3 ) no score  @xcite .",
    "each game thus affords a ` worm ' tracking the score differential between two teams .",
    "we will call these worms ` game stories ' and we provide an example in fig .  [ fig : sog.example_worm ] .",
    "the game story shows that geelong pulled away from hawthorn  their great rival over the preceding decade  towards the end of a close , back and forth game .",
    "each game story provides a rich representation of a game s flow , and , at a glance , quickly indicates key aspects such as largest lead , number of lead changes , momentum swings , and one - sidedness . and",
    "game stories evidently allow for a straightforward quantitative comparison between any pair of matches .    for the game story ecology we study here",
    ", an important aspect of the afl is that rankings ( referred to as the ladder ) , depend first on number of wins ( and ties ) , and then percentage of ` points for ' versus ` points against ' .",
    "teams are therefore generally motivated to score as heavily as possible while still factoring in increased potential for injury .",
    "we order the paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sog.basics ] , we first present a series of basic observations about the statistics of afl games .",
    "we include an analysis of conditional probabilities for winning as a function of lead size .",
    "we show through a general comparison to random walks that afl games are collectively more diffusive than simple random walks leading to a biased random walk null model based on skill differential between teams .",
    "we then introduce an ensemble of 100 sets of 1,310 biased random walk game stories which we use throughout the remainder of the paper . in secs .",
    "[ sec : sog.gameshapes ] and [ sec : sog.gamemotifs ] , we demonstrate that game stories form a spectrum rather than distinct clusters , and we apply coarse - graining to elucidate game story motifs at two levels of resolution .",
    "we then provide a detailed comparison between real game motifs and the smaller taxonomy of motifs generated by our biased random walk null model .",
    "we explore the possibility of predicting final game margins in sec .",
    "[ sec : sog.prediction ] .",
    "we offer closing thoughts and propose further avenues of analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : sog.conclusion ] .",
    "while every afl game is officially comprised of four 20 minute quarters of playing time , the inclusion of stoppage time means there is no set quarter or game length , resulting in some minor complications for our analysis .",
    "we see an approximate gaussian distribution of game lengths with the average game lasting a little over two hours at 122 minutes , and 96% of games run for around 112 to 132 minutes ( @xmath0 minutes ) . in comparing afl games",
    ", we must therefore accommodate different game lengths .",
    "a range of possible approaches include dilation , truncation , and extension ( by holding a final score constant ) , and we will explain and argue for the latter in sec .",
    "[ sec : sog.gameshapes ] .      in post - game discussions",
    ", commentators will often focus on the natural chapters of a given sport . for quarter - based games ,",
    "matches will sometimes be described as ` a game of quarters ' or ` a tale of two halves . ' for the afl , we find that scoring does not , on average , vary greatly as the game progresses from quarter to quarter ( we will however observe interesting quarter - scale motifs later on ) . for our game database , we find there is slightly more scoring done in the second half of the game ( 46.96 versus 44.91 ) , where teams score one more point , on average , in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter ( 23.48 versus 22.22 ) . this minor increase may be due to a heightened sense of the importance of each point as game time begins to run out , the fatiguing of defensive players , or as a consequence of having ` learned an opponent '  @xcite .",

    "[ fig : sog.conditional_scoring ] , we show that , as for a number of other sports , the probability of scoring next ( either a goal or behind ) at any point in a game increases linearly as a function of the current lead size ( the national basketball association is a clear exception )  @xcite .",
    "this reflects a kind of momentum gain within games , and could be captured by a simple biased model with scoring probability linearly tied to the current lead .",
    "other studies have proposed this linearity to be the result of a heterogeneous skill model  @xcite , and , as we describe in the following section , we use a modification of such an approach .",
    "we next examine the conditional probability of winning given a lead of size @xmath2 at a time point @xmath3 in a game , @xmath4 .",
    "we consider four example time points  the end of each of the first three quarters and with 10 minutes left in game time  and plot the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.conditional_winning_quarters ] .",
    "we fit a sigmoid curve ( see caption ) to each conditional probability .",
    "as expected , we immediately see an increase in winning probability for a fixed lead as the game progresses .",
    "these curves could be referenced to give a rough indication of an unfolding game s likely outcome and may be used to generate a range of statistics . as an example , we define likely victory as @xmath5 and find @xmath2 = 32 , 27 , 20 , and 11 are the approximate corresponding lead sizes at the four time points . losing games after holding any of these leads might be viewed as ` snatching defeat from the jaws of victory . '    similarly , if we define close games as those with @xmath6 , we find the corresponding approximate lead sizes to be @xmath7 6 , 5 , 4 , and 2 .",
    "these leads could function in the same way as the save statistic in baseball is used , i.e. , to acknowledge when a pitcher performs well enough in a close game to help ensure their team s victory . expanding beyond the afl , such probability thresholds for likely victory or uncertain outcome",
    "may be modified to apply to any sport , and could be greatly refined using detailed information such as recent performances , stage of a season , and weather conditions .     at the end of the first three quarters * ( a  c ) * and with 10 minutes to go in the game * ( d)*. bins are comprised of the aggregate of every 6 points as in fig .

    "for the purpose of exploring motifs later on , we will create 100 sets of 1,310 games .",
    "an important and subtle aspect of the null model is the scoring bias , which we will denote by @xmath12 .",
    "we take the bias for each game simulation to be a proxy for the skill differential between two opposing teams , as in @xcite , though our approach involves an important adjustment .    in  @xcite ,",
    "a symmetric skill bias distribution is generated by taking the relative number of scoring events made by one team in each game .",

    "[ fig : sog.biased18motifs ] provide us with the essence of each cluster , and , though they do not represent any one real game , they are helpful for the eye in distinguishing clusters .",
    "naturally , by applying further coarse - graining as we do below , we will uncover a richer array of more specialized motifs .",
    "looking at figs .",
    "[ fig : sog.biased18motifs ] and  [ fig : sog.realmotifs18ratio - random ] , we now clearly see a continuum of game shapes ranging from extreme blowouts ( motif # 1 ) to extreme comebacks , both successful ( motif # 17 ) and failed ( motif # 18 ) . we observe that while some motifs have qualitatively similar story lines , a game motif that has a monotonically increasing score differential that ends with a margin of 200 ( # 1 ) is certainly different from one with a final margin of 50 ( # 6 ) .    in considering this",
    "induced taxonomy of 18 game motifs , we may interpret the following groupings :    * # 1#6 , # 8 : one - sided , runaway matches ; * # 9 : losing early on , coming back , and then pulling away ; * # 7 and # 10 : initially even contests with one side eventually breaking away ; * # 11 and # 12 : one team taking an early lead and then holding on for the rest of the game ; * # 13 , # 14 , and # 16 : variations on tight contests ; * # 15 and # 17 : successful comebacks ; * # 18 : failed comebacks .",
    "we note that the game stories attached to each motif might not fit these descriptions  we are only categorizing motifs .",
    "as we move to finer grain taxonomies , the neighborhood around motifs diminishes and the connection between the shapes of motifs will become increasingly congruent with its constituent games .",
    "the extreme blowout motif for real games has relatively fewer adjacent random walk game stories ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.realmotifs18ratio - random]a ) , as do the two successful comeback motifs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.realmotifs18ratio - random]c and fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.realmotifs18ratio - random]f ) , and games with a lead developed by half time that then remains stable ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.realmotifs18ratio - random]e ) .",
    "a total of 5 motifs show a relatively even balance between real and random ( i.e. , within 10% ) including two of the six motifs with the tightest finishes ( figs .",
    "[ fig : sog.realmotifs18ratio - random]h and [ fig : sog.realmotifs18ratio - random]i ) .",
    "biased random walks most overproduce games in which an early loss is turned around strongly ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.realmotifs18ratio - random]q ) or an early lead is maintained ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.realmotifs18ratio - random]r ) . in terms of game numbers behind motifs",
    ", we find a reasonable balance with 603 ( 46.0% ) having @xmath59 ( 7 motifs ) , 430 ( 32.8% ) with @xmath60 ( 5 motifs ) , and 277 ( 21.1% ) with @xmath61 ( 6 motifs ) .",
    "depending on the point of view of the fan and again at this level of 18 motifs , we could argue that certain real afl games that feature more often that our null model would suggest are more or less ` interesting ' .",
    "for example , we see some dominating wins are relatively more abundant in the real game ( # 1 , # 2 , and # 4 ) . while such games are presumably gratifying for fans of the team handing out the ` pasting ' , they are likely deflating for the supporters of the losing team . and a neutral observer may or may not enjoy the spectacle of a superior team displaying their prowess .",
    "real games do exhibit relatively more of the two major comeback motifs ( # 15 and # 17)certainly exciting in nature  though less of the failed comebacks ( # 18 ) .",
    "increasing our level of resolution corresponding to an average intra - cluster game distance of @xmath64 , we now resolve the afl game story ecology into 71 clusters .",
    "we present all 71 motifs in figs .",
    "[ fig : sog.biased71motifs - final - margin - order ] and [ fig : sog.biased71motifs - ratio - order ] , ordering by final margin and real - to - random game story ratio @xmath58 respectively ( we will refer to motif number and fig .  [",
    "fig : sog.biased71motifs - ratio - order ] so readers may easily connect to the orderings in both figures ) . with a greater number of categories , we naturally see a more even distribution of game stories across motifs with a minimum of 1 ( motif # 1 , fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.biased71motifs - ratio - order]ac ) and a maximum of 48 ( motif # 43 , fig .  [ fig : sog.biased71motifs - ratio - order]ah ) .    as for the coarser 18 motif taxonomy",
    ", we again observe a mismatch between real and biased random walk games .",
    "for example , motif # 14 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.biased71motifs - ratio - order]af ) is an average of 25 real game stories compared with on average 15.13 adjacent biased random walks while motif # 20 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.biased71motifs - ratio - order]cs ) has @xmath58=10/22.67 . using our 10% criterion",

    "however , we also find some kinds of comeback motifs are also more prevalent ( @xmath59 ) though not strongly in absolute numbers ; these include the failed comebacks in motifs # 67 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.biased71motifs - ratio - order]ad ) and # 71 ( fig .",

    "the larger final margins of the blowout games feature on the right of these plots ( @xmath59 ) , and , in moving to the left , we see a gradual tightening of games as shapes become more favorably produced by the random null model ( @xmath61 ) . the continuum of game stories is also reflected in the basic similarity of the two plots in fig .",

    "can we improve our ability to predict the outcome of a game in progress by knowing how games with similar stories played out in the past ? does the full history of a game help us gain any predictive power over much simpler game state descriptions such as the current time and score differential ? in this last section , we explore prediction as informed by game stories , a natural application .",

    ", the average final margin of the analog games slightly underestimates the final margin of the game of interest , and the range of outcomes for the 50 analog games is broad with the final margin spanning from around -40 to 90 points .",
    "having defined our prediction method , we now systematically test its performance after 30 , 60 , and 90 minutes have elapsed in a game currently under way . in aiming to find the best combination of memory and analog number , @xmath82 and @xmath49",
    ", we use  eq .  ( [ eq : sog.prediction ] ) to predict the eventual winner of all 1,310 afl games in our data set at these time points .",
    "first , as should be expected , the further a game has progressed , the better our prediction . more interestingly , in fig .  [",
    "fig : sog.memory_vs_analogs ] we see that for all three time points , increasing @xmath49 elevates the prediction accuracy , while increasing @xmath82 has little and sometimes the opposite effect , especially for small @xmath49 .",
    "the current score differential serves as a stronger indicator of the final outcome than the whole game story shape unfolded so far . the recent change in scores  momentum  is also informative , but to a far lesser extent than the simple difference in scores at time @xmath3 .",
    "based on fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.memory_vs_analogs ] , we proceed with @xmath89 analogs and two examples of low memory : @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",

    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : sog.prediction_performance ] that there is essentially no difference in prediction performance between the two methods .",
    "thus , memory does not appear to play a necessary role in prediction for afl games .",
    "of interest going forward will be the extent to which other sports show the same behavior . for predicting the final score",
    ", we also observe that simple linear extrapolation performs well on the entire set of the afl games ( not shown ) .",
    "nevertheless , we have thus far found no compelling evidence for using game stories in prediction , nuanced analyses incorporating game stories for afl and other professional sports may nevertheless yield substantive improvements over these simple predictive models  @xcite .",
    "overall , we find that the sport of australian rules football presents a continuum of game types ranging from dominant blowouts to last minute , major comebacks . consequently , and rather than uncovering an optimal number of game motifs , we instead apply coarse - graining to find a varying number of motifs depending on the degree of resolution desired .",
    "we further find that ( 1 ) a biased random walk affords a reasonable null model for afl game stories ; ( 2 ) the scoring bias distribution may be numerically determined so that the null model produces a distribution of final margins which suitably matches that of real games ; ( 3 ) blowout and major comeback motifs are much more strongly represented in the real game whereas tighter games are generally ( but not entirely ) more favorably produced by a random model ; and ( 4 ) afl game motifs are overall more diverse than those of the random version .    our analysis of an entire sport through its game story ecology could naturally be applied to other major sports such as american football , association football ( soccer ) , basketball , and baseball .",
    "a cross - sport comparison for any of the above analysis would likely be interesting and informative . and at a macro scale",
    ", we could also explore the shapes of win - loss progressions of franchises over years  @xcite .",
    "it is important to reinforce that a priori , we were unclear as to whether there would be distinct clusters of games or a single spectrum , and one might imagine rough theoretical justifications for both .",
    "our finding of a spectrum conditions our expectations for other sports , and also provides a stringent , nuanced test for more advanced explanatory mechanisms beyond biased random walks , although we are wary of the potential difficulty involved in establishing a more sophisticated and still defensible mechanism .    finally , a potentially valuable future project would be an investigation of the aesthetic quality of both individual games and motifs as rated by fans and neutral individuals  @xcite .",
    "possible sources of data would be ( 1 ) social media posts tagged as being relevant to a specific game , and ( 2 ) information on game - related betting .",
    "would true fans rather see a boring blowout with their team on top than witness a close game  @xcite ? is the final margin the main criterion for an interesting game ?",
