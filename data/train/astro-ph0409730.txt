    "the main challenges facing the standard core accretion model for planet formation are finding a mechanism for building up a population of planetesimals and forming sufficiently massive proto - uranus and proto - neptune cores before the end of the oligarchic growth stage and before the solar nebula dissipates on @xmath5 yr timescales .    in the core accretion model ,",
    "planetesimals are built up from approximately @xmath6m - sized grains to km - sized bodies by collisional sticking .",
    "two major problems face collisionally sticking these bodies together . first",
    ", growing particles from centimeter through kilometer sizes is problematic . while many have argued for the coagulation of grains based on some requisite coagulation velocity ( e.g. weidenschilling 1997 ) such velocities are often much higher than those below which sticking might occur based on microgravity experiments such as blum & muench ( 1993 ) .",
    "more recently , colwell ( 2003 ) showed that at least in some conditions cm - sized grain coagulation can occur , but this occurs for relative velocities below @xmath7 and greater relative velocities are encountered in either a turbulent or laminar disk ( see youdin & shu 2002 , hereafter ys02 , and references therein ) .",
    "an operative sticking mechanism also remains in question : both known solid state sticking forces and the bodies self gravity are arguably too weak ( ys02 ) .",
    "second , even if such sticking were possible , the timescale for meter - sized bodies to spiral in to the sun ( by gas drag ) is short ( weidenschilling 1977 ) , @xmath8 years at 1 au , such that planetesimal formation in all but the outermost regions of the solar nebula might not proceed fast enough .",
    "one can circumvent this problem if a particle subdisk gravitational instability ( gi ) can very quickly build up a population of @xmath9 planetesimals directly ( goldreich & ward , 1973 ; ys02 ) .",
    "however , formation timescale problems still remain for ice giants uranus and neptune . for a mmsn distribution ,",
    "the oligarchic growth stage does not yield neptune - mass cores ( for a @xmath1 15 au ) , so that a @xmath10 core must be formed by colliding together sub earth - mass oligarchs .",
    "levison & stewart ( 2001 ) showed that the embryos mutual perturbations result in a large number of ejections ( not mergers ) of embryos in the outer solar system , so that the formation timescale for a @xmath11 proto - neptune core is prohibitively long .",
    "the two most widely explored attempts at a solution are positing a massive ( @xmath1 @xmath12 mmsn ) disk during the planet formation epoch ( goldreich et al . , 2004 , hereafter go04 ) or that ice giant cores were gravitationally scattered to their present orbits after brisker formation in the trans - saturnian region ( thommes et al . 2002 ;",
    "thommes et al . 2003 ) .",
    "however , these ideas , while plausible , introduce very case - specific assumptions about the initial state of the solar nebula or its dynamical history .    the purpose of this paper is to show that another mechanism for forming ice giant cores within the core accretion model exists that is more generally applicable to protoplanetary disks .",
    "specifically , one may be able to form uranus and neptune - mass cores in situ and on solar nebula dissipation timescales from what is currently the most plausible mechanism for inducing particle subdisk gi necessary for planetesimal formation . in section 2 & 3 we first review this planetesimal formation mechanism , called here the sekiya - youdin gravitational instability model , and then argue that it could aid ice giant formation in proceeding quickly .",
    "next , in section 4 we describe our recalculation of grain pileups in this model originally done by ys02 and youdin & chiang ( hereafter yc04 ) , develop a simple model for calculating protoplanetary core masses at the end of oligarchy and core formation timescales . in section 5",
    "we present our the results of our core mass and formation timescale calculations , showing how the @xmath13 , solid body surface density , profile resulting from this planetesimal formation mechanism alters these values substantially . in the discussion section we put this model in a historical context , summarize it , and describe what research within this model should be done further .",
    "finally , we include an appendix describing the protoplanetary disk conditions necessary to allow gi .",
    "unless one assumes a hitherto unknown efficient sticking mechanism for growing @xmath14 bodies one likely has to posit some sort of particle layer gi to build up km - sized planetesimals .",
    "planetesimal formation by gi , as developed by goldreich & ward ( 1973 ) , was long considered problematic , though .",
    "the chief reason for this was that as particles settle towards the disk midplane the disk becomes sufficiently vertically stratified that kelvin - helmholtz turbulence develops .",
    "turbulent eddies resulting from the kelvin - helmholtz instability induce particle random velocities that are too high to allow gi , and equilibrium vertical profiles for particles result in spatial densities that are at least an order of magnitude too low ( weidenschilling 1980 ; cuzzi , dobrovolskis , & champney 1993 ; weidenschilling 1995 ) .",
    "sekiya et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , however , found that if the ratio of dust to gas surface densities was sufficiently enhanced over standard solar values , turbulence induced by kelvin - helmholtz vertical shear will not be sufficient to stir all the solids : the rest will be able to precipitate towards the disk midplane and induce gi . ys02 and yc04 provide a likely mechanism for achieving this enhancement by pileup of grains from gas drag - induced migration , avoiding the main difficulty with gi from goldreich & ward ( 1973 ) .",
    "we now describe this mechanism following ys02 and yc04 .    because gas is more sensitive to pressure gradients , it orbits at slightly sub - keplerian velocities where the relative velocity difference between gas and dust is proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "the dust then experiences a headwind , and thus a drag force . for a stopping time of a particle moving relative to the gas of @xmath16 , and gas and particle densities of @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "respectively and particle sizes @xmath19 , the inward particle flux through the disk is @xmath20 , migration due to epstein drag is @xmath21 and turbulent stresses is @xmath22 @xmath23 ( whose effect is small : see yc04 ) . this inward particle flux from epstein drag - induced migration results in grain pileups if the flux decreases with decreasing stellocentric distance @xmath24 .",
    "explicitly , whether such a condition is satisfied depends on the radial profiles for solid and gas surface densities @xmath13 and @xmath25 as well as the temperature profile .    in a mmsn model ,",
    "one starts with solid body gas profiles of @xmath26 and @xmath27 and a temperature profile of @xmath28 .",
    "the migration rate due to epstein drag is @xmath29 as @xmath30 depends on @xmath31 and @xmath32 which in turn depend on t and @xmath25 . isolating the radial power law dependence of t and @xmath25 on",
    "@xmath24 one finds that the drift rate dependence goes as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 the mass accretion rate is @xmath35 where @xmath36 or @xmath37 for grain migration in the epstein drag regime .",
    "if e @xmath1 0 initially then the accretion rate increases with stellocentric distance , resulting in particle pileups and thus @xmath13 enhancement .",
    "epstein drag then results in grain pileups from the particle flux s sensitivity to the gas density and temperature profiles .",
    "once enhancements of @xmath38 from migration are sufficiently high such that the solid particle surface density , @xmath13 , rises above some critical value @xmath39 then particle subdisk gi ( and thus planetesimal formation ) commences from dust in excess of @xmath39 .",
    "epstein drag - induced migration brings about particle layer gi because pileup of solid grains from migration can raise @xmath13 above @xmath39 , overcoming kelvin - helmholtz shear instabilities .",
    "particle layer gravitational instabilities are allowed once the solid to gas ratio is enhanced by @xmath40 ( see yc04 ) .",
    "garaud & lin ( 2004 ) find a similar criteria for gi using a more sophisticated two - fluid treatment .",
    "ys02 and yc04 showed how epstein drag - induced grain migration can procure planetesimal formation but did nt explore the effect that such migration has on the efficiency of planet formation .",
    "epstein drag - induced migration of grains , as shown by ys02 & yc04 , yields substantially different solid body surface density profiles from an mmsn profile , enhancing @xmath13 . since the criteria for gi ( and planetesimal formation )",
    "is a @xmath41 enhancement of @xmath13 , the mass of planetesimals available form which to form protoplanets should greatly increase within the dust subdisk as the mass from which such planetesimals are formed is locally enhanced by importing material from the outer solar nebula via migration .",
    "as the masses of post - oligarchic cores as well as protoplanet formation and inelastic collisional damping and collision timescales depend strongly on @xmath13 a seemingly simple enhancement of @xmath13 by about an order of magnitude could have very important implications for the efficiency of planet formation in regions with such enhancement .",
    "the effect was nt obvious from ys02 and yc04 since both papers did not include solid enhancement from water ice condensation in their initial @xmath13 profiles .",
    "for example , model h in yc04 then triggers gi at an outer boundary of only @xmath42 2 au while model af triggers gi at an inner boundary with an enhancement of only @xmath43 at 15 - 25 au when one compares the resulting @xmath13 profile with an mmsn profile including the water ice enhancement .",
    "however , if one includes water ice condensation in @xmath44 then pileup should proceed faster further away from the sun .",
    "planetesimal formation could then be triggered earlier and the resulting @xmath13 profile could influence planet formation efficiency in the outer solar system ( 10 - 30 au ) .",
    "we then are motivated to redo the ys02 calculations ( equations 22 - 30 ) for the radial migration of mm - sized grains but include the solid enhancement for @xmath45 due to the water ice condensation .",
    "we also estimate core masses expected at the end of the oligarchic growth stage as well as formation timescales for @xmath46 cores .",
    "following ys02 we assume a population of uniformly - sized particles comprising the solid body column @xmath13 .",
    "its time - dependent profile is @xmath47 which has an analytical solution : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the initial location of a particle now at a after time given by eq .",
    "26 of ys02 : @xmath51      we then estimate oligarchic core masses and core formation timescales in the standard mmsn model and the model modified for migration of mm - sized grains .",
    "oligarchic growth ends in once oligarchs velocity excitations from mutual viscous stirring overtakes their damping rates which result from dynamical friction with smaller planetesimals .",
    "this condition is met once the `` surface density '' of protoplanets , @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the feeding zone size , becomes comparable to the residual surface density of smaller bodies such that @xmath54 ( go04 ) .",
    "assuming that little mass is yet lost from the system this condition can be related to the initial surface density of solids : @xmath55 solving for @xmath56 then yields the protoplanet mass at the end of oligarchy ( @xmath57 ) : @xmath58 after oligarchy ends dynamical interactions between oligarchs results in ejection of many of them , not mergers ( levison & stewart 2001 ) .",
    "for calculating the core formation timescale we generally follow ida & lin ( 2004 ) and kokubo & ida ( 2002 ) with some modifications depending on the size of accreted planetesimals gleaned from rafikov ( 2004 ) . from kokubo & ida ( 2002 )",
    ", the mass accretion rate of a protoplanetary core depends on @xmath13 , the mass of the core at time t , the core s size @xmath59 , its stellocentric distance @xmath60 , and the velocity dispersion of accreted planetesimals : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the rms eccentricity of planetesimals and c is a factor of order unity .",
    "the planetesimals rms eccentricity is found by equating the viscous stirring and gas drag timescales @xmath63 ( kokubo & ida ( 2002 ) ) .",
    "the formation timescale is then given as @xmath64 .",
    "the approximate formation timescale for a core is then given by ida & lin ( 2004 ) : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the mean accreted planetesimal mass for a protoplanet in a core feeding zone size of @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the rate of accretion of @xmath69 planetesimals can be described by the above equation and accretion is then said to be dispersion dominated. however , if the accreted planetesimals are small enough their relative velocities to cores are set by differential shear within the hill radius of the core . in this case , the approach velocity of a planetesimal to the core is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the core s hill radius , and the vertical component of the planetesimal s velocity , @xmath72 , small .",
    "for a small enough @xmath72 the planetesimal disk becomes very thin and the embryo can accrete the entire vertical column of planetesimals ( rafikov 2004 ) .",
    "this regime of accretion is called shear - dominated accretion as the shear from the planetesimal disk around a core sets that core s velocity . rafikov ( 2004 ) then shows that the formation timescale for protoplanetary cores accreting shear- dominated planetesimals then is shorter .",
    "we rewrite the timescale here , generalizing it to variables @xmath13 , @xmath18 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 : @xmath75 where @xmath74 is the fraction of planetesimals which are shear dominated and @xmath18 is their mass density .",
    "these isolated body equations for @xmath57 and @xmath76 should be valid as long as growth occurs prior to the end of oligarchy and on timescales comparable to or less than the complete dissipation of the gas disk .      the size of accreted planetesimals is likely to be smaller than the @xmath77 bodies formed after gi .",
    "kilometer - sized objects inelastically collide and fragment if their collisional velocities exceed @xmath78 , the energy per gram needed to release half of the planetesimal s mass upon collision . for a 300 m projectile hitting a 1 km target @xmath79 ( leinhardt & richardson 2002 ) , where @xmath78 decreases for mass ratios approaching unity : low @xmath78 s are consistent with the standard low internal strength , rubble pile model for icy @xmath80-sized bodies such as comets ( e.g. asphaug & benz 1996 ) . the random velocity needed to disrupt a 1 km planetesimal is @xmath81 for a comparably - sized projectile of @xmath82 .",
    "this velocity is comparable to @xmath83 at 30 au .",
    "the velocity of collisions actually experienced between @xmath84-sized planetesimals near a protoplanetary core is set by the hill velocity , @xmath83 , because their random velocities are set by scattering encounters with the core ( go04 , kenyon & bromley 2004 , and rafikov 2004 ) .",
    "furthermore , random velocities after a scattering encounter are likely to exceed @xmath83 ( see rafikov 2004 , equations 23 , 27 , 42 , and 46 ) unless the bodies already have @xmath85 .",
    "this means that 1 km planetesimals scattered by protoplanetary cores should fragment upon collision with one another , an outcome confirmed by numerical simulations of planetesimal interactions around cores ( e.g. kenyon & bromley 2004 ) .",
    "this is important because , as was alluded to before , the size of planetesimals very fundamentally affects core accretion rates .",
    "specifically , for small planetesimals accretion can be much more rapid when planetesimal accretion occurs in the aforementioned shear - dominated regime .",
    "we now describe the conditions for such accretion as they are given in rafikov ( 2004 ) .    whether planetesimal accretion is shear or dispersion dominated depends largely on values for a fiducial mass , @xmath86 and a fiducial size , @xmath87 which relate the planetesimal mass and sizes to planetesimal velocities induced after embryo - planetesimal scattering events . in particular , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "also important is a size , @xmath90 , where the reynolds number of the gas , @xmath91 , is @xmath92 , corresponding to changes in the drag coefficient experienced by a planetesimal moving through gas and where the planetesimal s velocity dispersion equals its velocity difference with the gas : @xmath93(rafikov 2004 ) .",
    "this size is given as @xmath94 where @xmath95 : the molecular mean free path ( @xmath25 is reduced by a factor of 1.25 compared to rafikov ( 2004 ) affecting @xmath96 , and @xmath90 ) .    as shown in equations ( 42 ) and ( 46 ) of rafikov ( 2004 ) , the velocity of a planetesimal relative to the hill velocity , @xmath83 , depends on the core mass , @xmath97 , as well as on @xmath86 , @xmath98 , @xmath87 , and @xmath90 . if @xmath99 then shear - dominated accretion sets in , and thus we can describe the boundary between dispersion and shear - dominated accretion as it depends on these parameters . for the stokes drag regime",
    "the condition for shear - dominated accretion is @xmath100 and for the epstein drag regime it is @xmath101 thus , after some time of planetesimal accretion , the planetesimals must collide frequently enough such that the population is ground down , keeping @xmath19 small , so that shear dominated accretion may persist .      for the radial migration calculations we begin with the following distributions of solids and gas .",
    "we set @xmath102 where @xmath103 interior to @xmath104 , and @xmath105 exterior .",
    "the initial gas & solid surface densities are given as @xmath106 and @xmath107 and temperature profile given as @xmath108 where p & n = 1.5 , and q = 0.5 , corresponding to model h in ys02 .",
    "the disk initially extends out to 250 au in this model , though the outer edge of the solid component of the disk moves inward with time . for this model ,",
    "the drift rate can be given as @xmath109 we assume that the grains are comparable in size to the largest chondrules ( @xmath110 ) to make direct comparisons for the same run in ys02 .",
    "we do calculations for the formation timescale of a @xmath46 core , one with the mean size of accreted planetesimals , @xmath19 , set at 1 km , another with @xmath111 to take into account fragmentation , and @xmath112 to further explore shear - dominated accretion .",
    "the density , @xmath18 , is set to @xmath113 , representing an upper limit for planetesimals and ice - rock cores .",
    "the solid particle migration run was stopped once one part of the disk had the requisite enhancement to induce a particle layer gravitational instability according to ys02 .",
    "figure 1 shows the time evolution of @xmath114 from an initial mmsn profile to the onset of particle subdisk gi .",
    "when the bump from water ice condensation is included in the surface density profile the time for the onset of gi is @xmath115 shorter and occurs much further out at @xmath42 27 au than in the same model in ys02 and yc04 , yielding @xmath116 from 20 - 25 au and @xmath117 at the outer edge of the particle subdisk ( @xmath118 ) before gi is initiated at @xmath119 yr . in the enhanced core accretion scenario ,",
    "the disk contains far more material from which to form protoplanets in precisely the regions where such formation has been most problematic for the standard core accretion model .",
    "as the figure shows , this occurs because the initial distribution in @xmath13 is now squeezed into a smaller surface area bounded roughly by the ice giant planet forming region due to epstein drag - induced migration .",
    "figure 2 shows the masses of oligarchs for standard and migration - enhanced core accretion models ( labeled sekiya - youdin migration ) . for the latter , the oligarchic mass for jupiter at 5.2 au is @xmath120 , @xmath121 for uranus at 20 au and @xmath122 for neptune at 25 au , values much greater than in the standard model , implying that uranus and neptune could have accreted most , if not all , of their mass ( @xmath123)by the end of the oligarchic growth phase .",
    "the masses of embryos at the end of oligarchy are large enough that additional , post - oligarchic growth can be negligible . dynamical friction exerted by smaller bodies during oligarchic growth should dampen the embryos orbital eccentricities inhibiting ejection .",
    "substantial post - oligarchic growth by coalescing is then unnecessary since cores have already grown sufficiently massive during oligarchy .",
    "extra protoplanetary mass in the outer solar nebula is ejected after oligarchy ends ( go04 ) .",
    "figure 3 compares formation timescales for a @xmath46 protoplanet core for the standard core accretion model and the model utilizing the particle subdisk gi from sekiya and youdin s work to set @xmath13 . for the standard mmsn surface density profile",
    "the formation timescale for a @xmath46 proto - neptune core is @xmath124 and @xmath125 years at 25 au for @xmath126 and @xmath111 respectively .",
    "since @xmath127@xmath1@xmath128 and @xmath57 is significantly less than @xmath129 , the mmsn model will likely fail to produce neptune - like planets on requisite timescales",
    ". however , for the enhanced model the formation timescales are @xmath130 and @xmath131 years at 25 au for s = 1 km and s = 100 m .",
    "it then could be possible to form proto - neptune nearly in situ on a timescale less than the disk dissipation timescale ( 10 - 30 myr ) for @xmath132 .",
    "furthermore , a formation timescale of 20 myr at 25 au is most likely an overestimate as , using arguments from rafikov ( 2004 ) , protoplanets here should grow a large fraction of their mass while the accreted planetesimals are in the fast , shear - dominated regime .",
    "initially one starts with 1 - 10 km planetesimals where the initial growth rate is fast .",
    "however , once the core mass increases enough , planetesimal accretion becomes dispersion dominated and growth occurs much more slowly . to get back to faster , shear - dominated accretion , the initial population of planetesimals must drop in size enough such that @xmath85 .",
    "quantitatively , we refer back to the equations ( 11 ) through ( 13 ) . at 25 au @xmath86 and @xmath87 ,",
    "are @xmath133 and @xmath134 respectively and @xmath90 is @xmath135 .",
    "then , in the stokes regime , dispersion - dominated accretion persists for @xmath136 and @xmath137 for @xmath126 and @xmath138 the latter still not an appreciable fraction of neptune s current mass .",
    "however , the @xmath139 enhancement resulting from migration and pileup of mm - sized grains and subsequent gi helps to bring one back into the shear - dominated accretion regime earlier and persist there for longer times by the following argument .",
    "this enhancement drives down the collision timescale by nearly an order of magnitude as the collision rate is proportional to the number density of planetesimals and thus @xmath13 ( e.g. wetherhill & stewart 1993 , equation a1 ) .",
    "this increases the dominance of collisions and collisional damping over gas damping and inspiral of solids ( the latter timescale is longer than gas damping by a factor of @xmath140 ) .",
    "if @xmath13 is enhanced we should expect more frequent collisions early on .",
    "as the collisions tend to be disruptive at expected impact speeds of @xmath141 , an enhancement in @xmath13 should result in planetesimal swarms of smaller mean sizes .",
    "the smaller sizes translate into planetesimal dynamics occurring in different drag regimes and longer times spent in shear dominated planetesimal accretion . specifically , at 25 au , planetesimals are in the epstein regime for @xmath142 .",
    "as this is slightly below an order of magnitude reduction in the size of the initial swarm and collision rates between planetesimals are greater for enhanced @xmath13 , it is likely that an appreciable fraction of accreted solids are in the epstein drag regime and this regime is reached earlier than when a standard mmsn @xmath13 distribution is used .",
    "one stays in the shear - dominated , epstein drag regime as long as @xmath143 and @xmath144 for @xmath145 and @xmath146 , the latter being comparable to the present rock / ice mass of neptune . in the context of planetesimal accretion",
    "this means that cores can accrete planetesimals in the fast shear - dominated regime through a larger fraction of their total mass .",
    "this has a drastic effect on the core formation timescale . for shear - dominated accretion",
    ", we then find the formation timescale for a @xmath46 core at 25 au to be @xmath147 if 10% of planetesimals are shear dominated ( shown in figure 3 ) and @xmath148 if all of them are : both values are less than the solar nebula dissipation timescale , @xmath149 .",
    "formation timescales in the outer solar nebula are then sufficiently reduced and conditions are more likely to be met such that accelerated protoplanet growth persists through a sufficient fraction of proto - neptune s final mass .",
    "the general idea in this paper that an enhancement of solid material in the uranus & neptune regions of the solar nebula during the first 10 myr is what led to rapid formation of ice giants is not new .",
    "various incarnations of this idea have appeared in the last twenty years ( e.g. lissauer 1987 ; pollack et al.1996 ; go04 ) and even when such an enhancement was not considered the primary factor in forming neptune on gas dissipation timescales , @xmath128 , it often plays a supporting role in increasing a proto - neptune s feeding zone zone ( e.g. bryden et al .",
    "these papers , however , usually assume such an enhancement of solids over mmsn values results solely from the disk mass itself being much greater than mmsn values .",
    "this paper relaxes that requirement , assuming a @xmath25 and initial @xmath13 profile comparable to mmsn values ( total disk mass here is @xmath150 spread over 250 au , out to 30 au it is @xmath151 ) , with very large enhancements of the solids achieved from grain migration and gi .",
    "thus , in this model it may be possible to get the same benefit you have from an initially massive disk ( e.g. more solids from which to form planets , higher planetesimal collision rates , etc . ) without the cost of having that disk mass be unreasonably large .    that a global radial redistribution of solids influences some part of the planet formation process has also been suggested previously .",
    "specifically , stepinski & valageas ( 1997 ) and kornet et al .",
    "( 2001 ) posited that gas drag in a turbulent disk result in solid surface density distributions that differ from the gas surface density , providing enhancements in the inner regions of the solar nebula when compared to their initial distributions .",
    "these papers , though , use a very simple treatment for grain coagulation for @xmath152 bodies , the size regime where a hierarchical sticking hypothesis seems to be highly problematic . the effect any solid body redistribution has on the efficiency of post - planetesimal growth was nt explored : rather , at least for kornet et al .",
    "( 2001 ) emphasis was placed on how different initial conditions for the disk mass and radial extent explain the diversity of planetary systems via their differences in grain redistribution .",
    "it appears that grain redistribution can lead to not only a diversity of system architectures but changes in the efficiency of planet formation .    the way in which planetesimal formation , particularly that of the gi model for planetesimal formation , influences the efficiency of planet formation has been hitherto underexplored and warrants further investigation .",
    "a comparison between analytical estimates of core formation timescales and numerical calculations assuming a @xmath13 distribution set by dust migration models such as ys02 should be made .",
    "furthermore , incorporating the shear - dominated planetesimal accretion model into such calculations is needed as many papers making pronouncements about the efficiency of protoplanetary core formation ( e.g. thommes et al . 2003 ) adopt a prescription for the mass accretion rate similar to that for dispersion - dominated accretion in this paper , where a planetesimal s rms equilibrium eccentricity is set by balancing viscous stirring by the protoplanet with gas drag from the solar nebula . as argued here and especially in rafikov ( 2004 ) ,",
    "if the planetesimals are small then accretion might proceed more rapidly .    if one considers the effect that epstein drag - induced migration has on the distribution of solids , the formation of cores in the outer solar nebula occurs on far shorter @xmath153 timescales than in the standard core accretion model . assuming an initially massive disk or requiring substantial gravitational scattering of proto - uranus and proto - neptune cores , while still plausible , may be unnecessary for forming uranus and neptune in @xmath154 .",
    "then hybrid mechanisms such as this one resulting from sekiya - youdin particle subdisk gi could eliminate core formation timescale problems in the outer solar system .",
    "furthermore , the mechanism outlined in this scenario is generic if planetesimal formation proceeds by particle subdisk gravitational instability as described by ys02 & yc04 , operating regardless of whether others do .",
    "gas pressure gradients then play an indispensible role in forming the cores of gas / ice giant planets quickly , as they do in the rival disk instability model ( see boss et al .",
    "2002 , haghighipour & boss 2003 ) , though in a slightly more indirect ( and less obvious ) way .",
    "the author would like to thank andrew youdin , scott kenyon , and richard nelson for extremely fruitful discussions and nader haghighipour , brad hansen , and the anonymous referee for suggestions that strengthened the arguments presented in this paper .",
    "this research was supported in part by the nasa astrobiology institute .",
    "it is important to ask whether the conditions for particle subdisk gravitational instability can be met .",
    "specifically , the main requirement for gi is that the disk must be sufficiently passive to initially allow the dust layer to collapse to a thickness set by a balance between settling and kelvin- helmholtz shear .",
    "if viscous stirring is strong enough to prevent this amount of settling then the entire gi mechanism for forming planetesimals becomes highly problematic .",
    "we show here that the assumption that gi can occur is at least reasonable .",
    "we first analyze previous attempts at constraining the equilibrium dust layer scale height achieved by balancing settling with diffusivity generated by richardson turbulence .",
    "yc04 calculated this criteria to be @xmath155 or @xmath156 for a mmsn model .",
    "the coefficient @xmath157 must then be less than @xmath158 for @xmath159 au .",
    "more stringent requirements can be found from dubrulle et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . from their equations 36 and 37 ,",
    "an equilibrium distribution of solids is written in terms of the ratio between the dust and gas scale heights ( h and h ) , the friction ( stopping ) time @xmath160 , and @xmath157 : @xmath161 the criteria for gi in terms of volume density is @xmath162 or @xmath163 or about a factor of @xmath164 increase over its solar abundance ( and @xmath165 the gas density ) .",
    "we then can rewrite the above condition as @xmath166 .",
    "as @xmath167 the criteria then becomes @xmath168 for grain sedimentation to a requisitely thin dust subdisk . while estimates for @xmath157 from molecular viscosity are small enough ( @xmath169 ) , values for @xmath157 needed to explain mass accretion rates onto t tauri stars range from @xmath170 .",
    "thus at first glance it seems as though conditions for gi include an implausibly low disk viscosity .",
    "however , as pointed out by yc04 , turbulence need not be isotropic , and when @xmath157 is resolved into components the criteria radially is given as @xmath171 ( from their equation b2 ) .",
    "the condition at 25 au is then that @xmath172 which is reasonable .",
    "the effective @xmath173 may differ substantially from the @xmath174 if the viscosity source is more effective at mixing radially than vertically .",
    "an example of a ratio between horizontal and vertical viscosities of order @xmath175 is cited by yc04 for earth s oceans and atmosphere .",
    "a stronger argument can probably be made based on investigating disk structure models in terms of whether a particular region is or is not viscously evolving , especially considering the effect of dust grains on levels of disk viscosity .",
    "the disk may spend a substantial fraction of its lifetime accreting through only thin surface layers sandwiched between a quiescent , magnetically dead layer containing a large fraction of the total column of the disk material in so called layered disk models ( gammie 1996 ) .",
    "the anomalous viscosity then presumably tapers off and disappears beyond a certain gas column density into the disk a result consistent with mhd simulations of layered disks from fleming & stone ( 2003 ) .",
    "fromang et al . (",
    "2002 ) shows that for @xmath176 and @xmath177 the outer radius of the dead zone can be as large as  100 au and occupy 90 @xmath178 of the vertical column density of the disk for metal fractions , @xmath179 , slightly below cosmic abundances . for @xmath180 a dead zone exists for all values of the disk metal fraction , not just subsolar values .",
    "furthermore , these calculations were done assuming that the grains do not affect the magnetic coupling to the disk , and the authors specifically assumed that settling of the grains to the disk midplane had already occurred : thus their ability to inhibit coupling of magnetic field lines to the gas would be irrelevant except for a vanishingly thin dust layer at the midplane .",
    "fleming & stone ( 2003 ) also suggest that including the effects of grains would inhibit the ability of magnetic field lines to couple to the gas .    in absence of this assumption ,",
    "fromang et al . (",
    "2002 ) suggests that _ because _ grains are effective at scavenging charge they may _ induce _ a magnetically dead state within the subdisk they are contained , preventing turbulence from the anomalous source of viscosity from stirring them up and thus allowing sedimentation to the disk midplane if vertical mixing is nt particularly strong .",
    "this intuition now seems to have been confirmed numerically .",
    "recently , nelson et al .",
    "( 2005 , in prep ) has investigated the effect that dust grains have on the coupling of magnetic field lines to the gas in the disk : thus their effect on the level of mri turbulence .",
    "this work suggests that dust grains are particularly efficient at scavenging charge in the disk , and their inclusion leads to dead zone @xmath25 s that are much larger than those in fromang et al .",
    "they find that in order to drive mri turbulence throughout the disk cross section at some distance , one needs to reduce the number density of dust grains by a factor of @xmath181 .",
    "accretion through the entire vertical column of the disk would then seem to _ presume _ that substantial grain growth and settling had already occurred .",
    "clearly , one can not at the moment make a strong case against the existence of conditions necessary for gi .",
