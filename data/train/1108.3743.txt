    "stress in @xmath5-direction ) or by external magnetic ( zeeman - effect ) or electric fields ( stark - effect ) .",
    "no data on the stark - effect for siv centers is available in the literature and the zeeman - effect is very weak.@xcite thus , residual mechanical stress in the nanodiamonds is most likely the major source for the observed zpl lineshifts .    for diamond islands on a foreign substrate several different mechanisms for stress formation",
    "have to be considered : first , stress builds up owing to the mismatch in the coefficients of thermal expansion ( ctfs ) between the substrate and diamond . in the present case",
    "the massive si substrate induces a biaxial compressive stress of in the tiny diamond crystals when the sample is cooled down from deposition temperature to room temperature at the end of the growth process.@xcite the geometric shape of isolated crystals corresponds to a truncated pyramid .",
    "in contrast to a closed diamond film , a certain fraction of the imposed stress can relax elastically .",
    "the amount of stress relaxation varies with the local position within the crystallites.@xcite coherency stress is a second contribution specifically important in heteroepitaxial material systems .",
    "the lattice constant of ir is 7.6% higher than that of diamond .",
    "pseudomorphic growth would yield an unrealistically high in - plane stress of as a consequence misfit dislocations are introduced from the very first stage of film growth and relaxation of misfit stress occurs . in a former detailed stress analysis of a 0.6",

    "in pcd films nearly exclusively tensile stress is found which is attributed to attractive grain boundary forces typically explained in the framework of the grain boundary relaxation model.@xcite in ref .",
    "a growth stress of was reported .",
    "the previous considerations mainly refer to macro stress . however , as described in ref .",
    ", during the coalescence of slightly misoriented grains , small angle grain boundaries can be substituted by disclinations and finally the initially individual crystals can continue growth as one single crystal .",
    "the coalescence process is accompanied by a strong local bending of the crystal lattice yielding high amplitudes of micro stress .",
    "former studies@xcite revealed a density of 2@xmath8 @xmath9 epitaxial diamond grains on ir after ben and 10 s growth .",
    "according to these observations we estimate that about 10 grains have merged to form the present nanoislands . due to the extremely high activation energy for the gliding of dislocations in diamond",
    "we assume that most of the dislocations are still present in the islands of our sample .",
    "the associated micro stress fields are locally experienced by the optical centers and induce the observed distribution of zpl positions .    for siv centers to our knowledge there",
    "exists only one measurement of stress shift rates in the literature : in ref .",
    "stress shifting and quenching of the siv fine structure have been investigated at low temperatures and for compressive stress applied in @xmath5-direction .",
    "shift coefficients in the range of -9 to 8.6 mev@xmath10gpa@xmath11 have been determined for different fine structure components . however , there are neither measurements of lineshift coefficients at room temperature nor investigations of lineshifts for stress applied in other directions .",
    "thus , we can state that the observed large spread in zpl positions is due to the locally varying micro stress fields but absent knowledge of both lineshift coefficients and stress orientation preclude determination of the stress field magnitude .",
    "we point out that the observed significant susceptibility of siv centers to environmental changes also potentially offers controlled wide range tunability of zpl wavelengths , already demonstrated for chromium related centers via electric fields.@xcite in the presence of inhomogeneous effects , resonance tuning is crucial for quantum information applications considering production of indistinguishable photons .",

    "is concentrated in the zpl , thus rendering the siv center especially suitable as a low bandwidth emitter .",
    "we point out that we observe 5 emitters with noticeably higher huang - rhys - factor ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "as discussed in the following , the huang - rhys - factors might be overestimated due to misinterpretation of electronic transitions as vibronic sidebands .",

    "[ fig : spcompl](b ) the sideband structure of individual siv centers varies significantly . in the following",

    "the relative intensity of the various sidebands changes significantly , evidencing preferential coupling to different modes ( see fig .  [",

    "the authors in ref .   attribute this to the excitation of a sub - ensemble with zpl at the excitation laser wavelength .",
    "this sub - ensemble within the inhomogeneously broadened line exhibits defined and identical sideband features , while the sideband structure is averaged out upon excitation of all inhomogeneously broadened siv centers . if the resonant excitation is tuned to longer wavelengths , the most prominent sideband feature at 64 mev shifts to lower phonon energies ( excitation tuned from the shifting behavior for a higher energy sideband at , however , shows no clear trend .",

    "the absorbing transition can also be provided via transitions to higher vibronic states in the excited state or higher excited electronic states of the color center , thus identification of the absorbing transition is unclear .",
    "if the siv center behaves like a single dipole in absorption one expects a sinusoidal characteristics with minima close to zero for excitation with linearly polarized light , as no light is absorbed if its polarization is perpendicular to the dipole axis . the visibility @xmath21 @xmath22 of a single dipole in absorption amounts to 100% .",

    "second , due to imaging through a high na objective , loss of polarization contrast occurs for linearly polarized emission.@xcite for a dipole in the sample plane we would expect 100% visibility , whereas for a dipole perpendicular to that plane polarization contrast fully vanishes , a 45 degrees tilt yields 70% visibility ( na 0.8 ) .",
    "thus , in principle , assuming a single dipole , one may use the visibility as well as the position of maxima and minima to determine the three - dimensional orientation of the dipole.@xcite nevertheless , the considerations in ref .   only hold for a dipole in an isotropic medium .",
    "siv centers in nanodiamonds on an ir surface constitute a highly anisotropic situation , leading to a strongly modified radiation pattern close to the metal surface.@xcite taking also into account the issue of background substraction , we therefore consider the polarization contrast non reliable to determine the tilt of the dipole with respect to the sample plane in our case .",

    "furthermore , the interpretation as siv@xmath28 defect is questionable , as the siv@xmath28 defect has recently been identified as the source of 1.31 ev emission using optical and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques.@xcite in summary , the measured dipole orientations imply a lower symmetry of the defect than predicted by prevalent theoretical models and assignment of transition polarizations and charge states seem questionable . to provide a reliable matching of theoretical prediction and experimental data a more precise determination of the dipole orientation as well as further theoretical work are necessary .",
    "we extensively investigated the spectral properties of single siv centers produced _ in situ _ during cvd growth . as advanced material system",
    "we employ large , thick heteroepitaxially grown nanoislands on ir / ysz / si substrates , thus combining enhanced fluorescence extraction and defined crystal orientation .",
    "we find intense , narrow zpls at around residual stress in the nanoislands leads to a spread in peak position of about the siv centers display low electron - phonon coupling with a mean huang - rhys - factor of 0.38 .",
    "individual sideband spectra vary significantly in accordance with previous ensemble observations . between 825 - 845",
    "nm an accumulation of narrow peaks is observed , tentatively attributed to a second electronic transition .",
    "polarization measurements show preferential absorption of linearly polarized light , linearly polarized emission as well as evidence for orientation of the center s dipole along the @xmath24 direction .",
    "these findings are in accordance with previous experimental results but contradictory to current theoretical models for the siv center .",
    "the spectroscopic properties deduced here support the suitability of siv centers as narrow bandwidth , high brightness room temperature single photon emitters .",
