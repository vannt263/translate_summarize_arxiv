    "recently , there has been a surge of interest in the properties of pyrochlore compound dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 , which is considered to be a model system of `` spin ice '' materials .",
    "`` spin ice '' materials governed by the same statistical mechanics of so - called `` ice rule '' as the hydrogen atoms in the ground state of ordinary hexagonal ice i@xmath5 have macroscopically degenerate ground states down to almost zero temperature.nature99,prb04,nature01,apa02 , prb03,jpcm01,prl01,jpsj04,prb02 experimentally , the observed value of ( 1/2)rln(3/2 ) through specific heat measurement@xcite is consistent with what is expected by pauling s theory , while the spin entropy only freezes out below about 4 k.@xcite from magnetic susceptibility studies , a strongly frequency dependent cooperative spin freezing is observed at about 16 k , which is associated with a very narrow distribution of spin relaxation times and a sharp drop at about 2 k.@xcite neutron scattering studies performed by fennell et al.@xcite also well demonstrate the spin ice state and the coexistence of long range ferromagnetic and short range antiferromagnetic order in a magnetic field applied along the [ 110 ] axis of dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath6 . in theoretical aspect ,",
    "melko and coworkers@xcite report numerical results on the low temperature properties of the dipolar spin ice model by the multicanonical monte carlo ( mc ) method and they find a first order transition to a long - range ordered phase .",
    "other researchersjpsj04 also confirm the existence of the transition under a magnetic field along the [ 110 ] axis with mc simulation .",
    "dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 has a typical a@xmath3b@xmath3o@xmath4 structure with the space group ( fd3 m , o@xmath5@xmath7 ) , no.227 .",
    "b cation is sixfold coordinated and locates at the center of the distorted octahedron formed by corner o ions .",
    "the a - site ions , i.e. , dy@xmath8(a magnetic rare - earth ion with effective spin s=1/2 ) resides on a lattice of corner - sharing tetrahedral , as shown in figure 1 of reference 3 . in the dy@xmath8 sublattice topology the spin configuration with two spins pointing directly towards while two spins pointing directly away from the center of the tetrahedral corresponds to the analogous proton disorder in real ice .",
    "then a ferromagnetic and dipolar nearest - neighbor spin - spin interaction leads to a strong geometrical frustration , preventing the system from long range ordering . as a result",
    ", high degeneracy of spin states will occur at low temperature .",
    "owing to the ising anisotropy arising from crystal - field effect in the pyrochlore lattice , the macroscopically degenerate states when the field is along the [ 111 ] direction are different from those for other field directions .",
    "for the [ 111 ] direction , the frustration structure changes from that of a three - dimensional pyrochlore to that of a two - dimensional kagome - like lattice with constraint , leading to different values of the zero - point entropy.@xcite the combination of ferromagnetic coupling and ising anisotropy may be a reason for the strong frustration . but how the spins interact with each other is not well understood in the spin ice materials .",
    "up to now , there has been no experimental report on the infrared optical properties of dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 .",
    "ir spectroscopy can give insight to the dynamical processes related to phonon , charge carrier , and spin .",
    "motivated by this situation , we studied the infrared reflectivity of dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystal on the [ 111 ] plane from room temperature down to 10 k. the temperature dependence of phonon modes is obtained , and the role played by spin - phonon coupling on the phonon modes is being discussed .",
    "dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystal was prepared by the floating zone method , using an infrared furnace equipped with two elliptical mirrors . before the single crystal growth",
    ", the polycrystalline rods was prepared by a standard solid state reaction .",
    "stoichiometric mixture of dy@xmath3o@xmath9 ( cerac , 99.99% ) and tio@xmath3 ( cerac , 99.9% ) was heated in air at 1250@xmath10c for five days with intermediate regrinding to ensure complete reaction .",
    "the typical growth condition was 4.5 mm / h for both feed and growth speeds . to avoid oxygen deficiency , the single crystal was grown in an o@xmath11 atmosphere of 0.3 mpa .",
    "the single crystal obtained was translucent yellow .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction measurements on the crystal confirmed that the product was a single phase with cubic pyrochlore structure and the parameter of the unit cell was a=10.1122 .",
    "the principal axes were determined using laue diffraction pattern .",
    "the crystal was cleaved and one - side polished with the surface parallel to the [ 111 ] plane .",
    "the reflectivity spectra r(@xmath12 ) at different temperatures were measured at near - normal incidence of about 8@xmath13 on a bomen da8 fourier transform infrared spectrometer , in the range from 50 to 6500 @xmath2 . in the far infrared region , a he cooled bolometer and 6 mm mylar beamsplitter were used . in the middle infrared region ,",
    "a liquid nitrogen cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector and kbr beamsplitter were utilized . to obtain the absolute reflectivity ,",
    "an evaporated golden mirror was served as a reference .",
    "spectra were collected with a resolution of 4 @xmath14 .",
    "the samples were mounted in a continuous helium flow cryostat in which the temperature could be varied between 300 and 10 k.",
    "the temperature dependent reflectivity of the dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystal shown in figure 1 is typical that of a nonmetallic system .",
    "the sharp features in the reflectivity spectra are due to the unscreened infrared active optical phonon modes , above the highest observed lattice vibration frequency , the reflectivity is flat and featureless up to the highest measured frequency .",
    "it can be seen that the reflectivity within the reststrahlen bands increases with decreasing temperature . at high temperature",
    "seven modes can easily be identified .",
    "the mode frequencies are obtained from a damped harmonic oscillator fit of reflectivity spectra with a complex dielectric function @xmath15 in the factorized form ( generalized lyddane - sachs - teller relation ) infrared , prb95 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the high frequency dielectric constant ( at frequencies large compared with the lattice vibration frequencies but small compared with the electronic transition frequencies ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the longitudinal and transverse eigenfrequencies of the jth optical phonon mode , @xmath20 and @xmath21 represent their longitudinal and transverse damping constants . using this dielectric function , all the reflectivity spectra in our measurements",
    "were fitted with the well known fresnel formula for reflectivity of a half space medium in vacuum@xcite : @xmath22 based on equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , a fit of r(w ) to the observed reflectivity spectra can be obtained with a proper choice of the model parameters @xmath23 , @xmath19 , @xmath24 , @xmath21 and @xmath25 .",
    "adjustment of the parameters is made by trial and error fitting of formula ( 2 ) to the experimental spectra .",
    "this method yields not only @xmath26 but also the model parameters which characterize the infrared active phonons .    from a group",
    "theoretical analysis,@xcite a compound with the pyrochlore structure symmetry should have the vibrational phonon modes at the brillouin zone center @xmath27 point with@xmath28=8 f@xmath29 + 4 f@xmath30 + 2 f@xmath31",
    "+ 4 f@xmath32 + 3 e@xmath33 + e@xmath34 + a@xmath31 + 3 a@xmath30.among these 26 normal modes , only a@xmath31 , e@xmath34 , 4 f@xmath32 are raman active , 7f@xmath29 are infrared active , and one f@xmath29 acoustical .",
    "consequently , the observed phonons in the spectra of dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 at low temperature except that at about 610 @xmath2 were denoted sequentially from low to high frequencies by f@xmath29@xmath35 to f@xmath29@xmath7 .",
    "the number is in good agreement with the group theoretical analysis .",
    "the mode at 610 @xmath2 , denoted by f@xmath29@xmath36 , is weak in intensity and does not change with the temperature .",
    "it is probably originated from two phonon absorption because of its low intensity.@xcite    the fitting results of the oscillator parameters for all the phonon modes of dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 are summarized in table  [ tab : table1 ] .",
    "the high frequency dielectric constant is adopted as 5.0 .",
    "figure 2 shows the experimental and fitting curves at two representative temperatures of 300 k and 10 k. the fitting results with the lorentz oscillators could explain the global features of the phonon spectra reasonably well , even though some difference between the experimental and the fitted data remains .",
    "a small deviation of the calculated curves from the experimental one is seen on the low frequency edge of f@xmath29@xmath37 mode in the high temperature .",
    "a possible reason is the reflection from the rear surface of the sample due to its transparency at low frequencies as well as the cutoff of the working frequency of the detector .",
    "however , the deviation has few impact on other phonon fitting parameters in other frequency range .    the real part of the optical conductivity @xmath38 can be extracted from @xmath39 , where @xmath40=@xmath41 , here @xmath12 is in unit of @xmath2 and @xmath42 in unit of @xmath43 @xmath2 , the corresponding result is shown in figure 3.@xcite the conductivity",
    "is dominated by seven peak structures due to optical phonon absorption , no free carrier contribution can be observed . for normal materials , with decreasing t , the anharmonic thermal motion would decrease , which results in a decrease in the lattice constant .",
    "then the phonons should shift to higher frequencies and their linewidth should become narrower .",
    "the f@xmath29@xmath44 mode has clearly demonstrated this effect .",
    "its center frequency shifts from 439 @xmath2 to 452 @xmath2 as the temperature decreases from 300 k down to 10 k. moreover , the phonon peak is more and more prominent and separated from the nearby mode f@xmath29@xmath45 .",
    "but it is puzzling that other modes do not exhibit the same behavior , the three most prominent phonons , f@xmath29@xmath37 , f@xmath29@xmath46 and f@xmath29@xmath47 , show discernible redshifts .",
    "coupling of phonons to magnetic excitations in solids may result in a change of phonon self - energy , i.e. , the frequency due to spin - phonon interaction .",
    "therefore , spin - phonon coupling@xcite closely correlated with the dy@xmath8 ( its effective spin s=1/2 ) could be a possible origin for the abnormal temperature dependence of the phonon frequency . as we mentioned in the introduction",
    ", dy@xmath8 cations can have appreciable magnetic moments .",
    "consequently , ferromagnetic nearest neighbor dipole - dipole interactions will present in spin ice dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath6 in which large dipole interactions have been suggested to be responsible for the spin ice behavior.@xcite these effects have been quantitatively confirmed by both experimental and theoretical approaches.@xcite at the nearest neighboring sites , the exchange interactions between the magnetic atoms become the strongest .",
    "subsequently , the crystal potential u can be described as following : @xmath48 where x is the atomic displacement from the equilibrium position in the oscillator model . in the second term , j@xmath49 is the exchange energy constant which is a function of the structural parameters , such as the bond lengths between dy@xmath8cations and the corresponding bond angles mediated by the o ions .",
    "s@xmath50 represents the spin of dy@xmath8cation at the ith site .",
    "@xmath51 denotes a statistical average over the adjacent spins .",
    "the harmonic force constant derived from its second derivative formula reads : @xmath52 note that the second term represents the spin - phonon coupling , which suggests that the phonon frequency should have an additional contribution . as for the spin - phonon coupling coefficient",
    ", @xmath53 can be different for each phonon and can have either a positive or a negative sign .",
    "furthermore , different phonon frequencies will have redshift or blueshift in the optical conductivity spectra .",
    "as the temperature decreases , spin fluctuation becomes weaker and spin - phonon coupling stronger .",
    "it is important to notice that although ferromagnetic correlations are short ranged without long range order in spin ice compounds , from neutron scattering measurements harris et al.@xcite have shown that the range of ferromagnetic order increases at lower temperature . as a result ,",
    "spin - phonon coupling range is wider so that the phonon frequency shows redshift or blueshift , which is in agreement with what is observed in our optical conductivity spectra .",
    "now we focus on the remarkable change of the spectra weight which is proportional to the area under the optical conductivity peak .",
    "it is well known that , by decreasing the temperature , thermal fluctuation reduces , which may result in narrowing in the linewidth and enhancement in the oscillator strength without any changes in the bonding or coordination .",
    "almost all phonon modes exhibit the theoretically predicted behavior in our optical conductivity spectra .",
    "but the spectral weight should not change . the anomalous increase in oscillator strength of the low - frequency modes",
    "must be taken sufficient care of .",
    "optical sum rules provide a powerful tool with which to analyze the behavior of free carriers and bound excitations.handbook the partial conductivity sum rules corresponding primarily to a single class of absorption such as excitation of phonons , conduction , valence , or core electrons have been developed . for oscillator states , the partial conductivity sum rule can be expressed as @xcite @xmath54 where @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( in unit of @xmath2 ) are the integral lower and upper limits and effective plasma frequency associated with the isolated phonon absorption , respectively . in the above equation , @xmath58 is in unit of @xmath59 .",
    "the integral region of the jth oscillator should be chosen to cover the full spectral weight .",
    "the dramatic increase in the spectra weight has implications for the distribution of charge and the change in local strength of the binding charge",
    ". the effective charge of dy , ti and o ions in the unit cell with k atoms can be determined through the following equation ( 6)(in gauss unit system)@xcite @xmath60 where v@xmath61 is the unit cell volume , j and k index the lattice modes and the atoms with mass m@xmath62 , respectively . for the effective charge",
    ", there is a general expression @xmath63=0 .    in dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 , oxygen is the lightest element , therefore , in the right side of equation ( 6 ) , the summation is dominated by o ion item and the terms for dy ion and ti ion may be neglected .",
    "the change in the effective charge is associated mainly with the oxygen ( i.e. , @xmath64@xmath65@xmath66 ) . combining equation ( 5 ) and equation ( 6 )",
    ", we obtain the value for @xmath66 as shown in figure 4 .",
    "the absolute value of @xmath66 is of less significance , what is important is the temperature dependence of the deduced value for @xmath66 , which increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "when the incident light couples to the induced dipole moments created by the atomic displacements associated with a normal mode , if the born effective charge per oxygen atom @xmath67 is increasing , then the size of the induced dipole moment and the optical absorption will also increase , which well explain the above temperature dependence of the optical conductivity . on the other hand ,",
    "the increase in @xmath66 means a change in the bond length and bond angle between o ion and cations so that the bond lengths between dy@xmath8 cations and the corresponding bond angles mediated by the o ions will change .",
    "subsequently , j@xmath49 and @xmath51 have different changes associated with phonon central frequency shift as we observed above . in summary , the change in the effective charge arising from electrical charge localization strengthening is the fundamental reason why the spectra weight increases and phonon frequency shifts . from our experimental results , within the framework of the ferromagnetic spin ice model , we consider that the increase in @xmath67 is closely related with nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic interaction strengthening and/or widening in the correlation range . in this simple physical picture , the increasing fm exchange between dy@xmath8 cations will lead to a decrease of the distance between mediated o ion and dy@xmath8 , which enhance the increase in @xmath66 , in agreement with our experimental observation .",
    "lst relationship also provides an effective examination on static optical permittivities",
    "@xmath68 in the approximation of zero phonon frequency . when @xmath69=0 , the equation evolutes into the following form : @xmath70 from equation ( 7 ) @xmath68 of dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystal at different temperatures are also obtained , as shown in the inset of figure 4 .",
    "it exhibits the same temperature dependence as @xmath66 , which suggests that the temperature dependence of @xmath68 can be originated from that of @xmath66 and essentially , charge localization arising from fm exchange plays an important role in the temperature variation of both @xmath68 and @xmath66 .",
    "in conclusion , fir response of dy@xmath3ti@xmath3o@xmath4 single crystals has been studied under different temperatures .",
    "seven infrared active phonons have been observed , which agrees well with a group analysis .",
    "all the spectra are fitted with the oscillator model and an excellent agreement between experimental and calculated spectra is obtained . of all phonons ,",
    "one shows discernible blueshift and three obvious redshifts with decreasing temperature .",
    "the shifts are attributed to the spin - phonon coupling in a geometrically frustrated configuration in the spin ice material .",
    "the oscillation strength of the low frequency modes increase dramatically at low temperature , indicating that the born effective charges are increasing in the unit cell .",
    "we propose that the similar temperature dependence of the static optical permittivity with born effective charge may originate from the intrinsic charge localization resulted from the nearest - neighbor fm interaction .",
