    "nuclear reactions around the fermi energy have revealed that nuclei can break into several pieces of various sizes : the so - called multifragmentation process@xcite .",
    "a striking feature of experimental observation is the large number of charge and energy partitions that can be accessed . in order to understand the statistical aspects of the explored phase - space",
    ", several physical origins have been proposed . among them",
    ", the nuclear liquid - gas phase transition appears as one of the best candidate .",
    "however , due to the complexity of nuclear reactions including impact parameter mixing , pre - equilibrium emission and thermal decay , it is hard to trace - back the process of cluster formation .",
    "nowadays , the complexity of experimental analyses increases constantly @xcite .",
    "conjointly , more and more elaborated models have been proposed to simulate reactions @xcite .",
    "however , the issue concerning cluster formation remains a highly debated question . in this work",
    ", we would like to contribute to the discussion on particle emission during the pre - equilibrium stage .",
    "we have tested a large number of hypothesis for the formation of clusters in the nuclear medium in order to provide event generators for the study of nuclear reactions .",
    "guided by the experimental observation , surprising conclusions concerning the way cluster are formed may be assessed .",
    "simple rules have been found for the formation and the emission of complex particles . the hypothesis retained are not only fully compatible with experiments on multifragmentation , but seems also to be adequate for nucleon - nucleus reactions in the same energy range .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first the rules for cluster formation and emission are introduced and illustrated in a schematic scenario for experiments . in a second part , additional effects that should be accounted to compare quantitatively with measurements are discussed .",
    "finally , the compatibility of the rules with data are illustrated .",
    "conclusions and perspectives are drawn at the end of the paper .",
    "in this section , rules for the cluster formation and the production of fragmentation partitions are defined . in order to illustrate these rules we consider a proton colliding a heavy target with an energy close to the fermi energy",
    ". then a simplified three steps scenario is considered ( see figure [ fig : clus1 ] ) .",
    "first the incident nucleon is absorbed .",
    "the second step corresponds to the in - medium formation of the cluster while the last step is the emission in the continuum .",
    "particles using a random sampling assumption for the nucleons forming the @xmath0 particle .",
    "this two - dimensional plot corresponds to the total `` accessible '' phase - space for the considered particle . ]",
    "the hypothesis retained to describe the last two stages can be summarized as follow :    * * cluster formation : * considering a cluster of mass @xmath1 and charge @xmath2 formed in the medium , we assume that the cluster is composed of nucleons chosen randomly in the target . thus , the kinematics of the cluster is directly linked to the kinematics of the nucleons .",
    "this defines the _ `` total accessible phase - space '' _ for the cluster @xmath3 in the medium .",
    "figure [ fig : clus0 ] displays the correlation between the position @xmath4 and the kinetic energy @xmath5 of an @xmath0 particle produced in a pb target obtained with the random sampling assumption .",
    "we would like to stress that the random assumption is a generalization of the pioneering work of goldhaber @xcite . *",
    "* cluster emission : * we dissociate here the total accessible phase - space from the explored phase - space because the latter must take into account the constraints of the reaction . indeed , while the first rule described above leads to a large set of configurations",
    ", all configurations will not necessarily lead to the emission of a cluster .",
    "two constraints can be identified .",
    "the first one , which is independent of the entrance channel , is due to the mutual interaction between the cluster and the heavy emitter .",
    "figure [ fig : clus2 ] shows an example of such an interaction in the case of an @xmath0 particle and a @xmath6 nucleus . in a classical picture , the cluster can not escape from the heavy nucleus if its energy is below the emission barrier .",
    "let @xmath7 be the interaction potential and @xmath8 the associated barrier .",
    "we have the `` local '' condition @xmath9 leading to a lower limit on the cluster kinetic energy . + the second constraint is directly dependent on the reaction type and is due to the energy balance .",
    "indeed , the accessible configuration is further reduced due to the total energy available in the reaction . in the simplified scenario presented here ( accounting for the fact that the initial nucleon is absorbed ) , we have the following inequality @xmath10 which gives an upper limit . here",
    "@xmath11 denotes the incident energy while @xmath12 is the q - value of the reaction .",
    "it is worth to notice that the second condition depends not only on the beam energy but also on the configuration itself .",
    "therefore , only a fraction of the total phase - space accessible for the cluster will indeed lead to emission in the continuum .",
    "this fraction corresponds to the _",
    "`` explored phase - space '' _ which takes into account the energy constraints induced by the reaction .",
    "these two constraints are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clus2 ] ( top left ) for a proton - induced reaction at @xmath13 mev .",
    "there , an @xmath0 particle can only be emitted in a small interval of kinetic energy ( called `` escape window '' in the following ) leading to a significant restriction in phase - space .",
    "the fraction of the phase - space available for the cluster emission is shown in figure [ fig : clus2 ] ( top - right ) . according to the energy constraint ,",
    "all configurations between the two lines lead to the emission of an @xmath0 particle .",
    "the prescription described above are compatible with experimental data as shown in the case of a proton - induced reaction at @xmath14 mev . assuming that the proton is absorbed by the target , a monte - carlo sampling ( using the cluster creation rules ) of the @xmath0 particle is obtained in order to obtain the initial configurations in the medium . then , using the emission rules , only those configurations allowed by the energy constraint are conserved .",
    "last , each conserved configuration is propagated in the target potential .",
    "thus , the @xmath0 kinetic energy distribution is obtained and successfully compared with the experimental data ( from @xcite ) .",
    "this is shown in figure [ fig : clus2 ] ( bottom part ) where the calculated spectrum ( open square ) is compared to experimental data ( filled circles ) .",
    "a similar agreement is found for the emission of protons , deuterons and tritons ( see fig . [",
    "fig : clus4 ] ) .",
    "however in this case , direct reactions are also present in the experimental data leading to an additional contribution at high energy .",
    "direct application of the rules to the simplified three steps scenario described above allows only qualitative comparisons with data . in order to provide quantitative comparisons ,",
    "additional effects must be considered .",
    "two phenomenological models ( called n - ipse @xcite and hipse @xcite based on the very same assumptions have been developed and confronted with the experimental data .",
    "we only give here the physical effects that have been added on top of the rules :    * * in medium nucleon - nucleon collisions : * at energies below the fermi energy , the effect of in medium two - body collisions is small .",
    "however , as the beam energy increases , such collisions must be taken into account .",
    "accordingly , the initial thomas - fermi distributions are distorted by two - body effects . *",
    "* influence of the impact parameter : * in nucleus - nucleus collisions , geometrical aspects associated with the impact parameter are accounted for by using a participant - spectator picture . in nucleon - induced reactions , this picture is replaced by the `` influence area '' ( equivalent to the participant region ) notion which defines the number of nucleons of the target affected by the projectile . *",
    "* one - body dissipation and nucleon absorption : * depending on the incident energy , particles are exchanged by the two partners of the reaction : this is treated by means of a phenomenological parameter ( see @xcite ) . in nucleon induced collisions ,",
    "this process is replaced by a probability that the incoming nucleon be absorbed by the target . * * application of _ cluster formation rules _ and `` nucleosynthesis '' in the medium : * we have described previously a rule to obtain cluster properties when a single cluster is formed in the medium .",
    "however , the number of clusters is not a priori fixed . in order to solve this difficulty in both models ,",
    "a coalescence algorithm is used to form clusters starting from the nucleons in the participant region . in the nucleon - induced reaction case",
    ", it was possible to show explicitly that this coalescence is equivalent to a random sampling assumption . * * application of _ cluster emission rules _ and final - state interaction ( fsi ) * : after the coalescence stage , many configurations are accessible . however due to the energy - balance generalized to the many cluster case ,",
    "only part of the accessible phase - space is really explored .",
    "in addition , if the relative energy between two clusters is lower than the barrier associated with their mutual interaction they will not separate during the expansion . in a realistic model , the recombination of fragments is allowed .",
    "in hipse , possible `` re - fusion '' of fragments is accounted for before the freeze - out configuration is reached .",
    "this process can lead to important fsi s and may relax completely the participant - spectator picture . for instance , the quasi - target and the quasi - projectile can fuse . * * freeze - out and the after - burner stage : * when the available energy is large , fragments are excited and once the chemical and thermal freeze - out are reached , the possible in - flight de - excitation of each cluster must be taken into account .",
    "this induces a complex mixing of pre- and post - equilibrium emission .",
    "more details on technical aspects can be found in ref .",
    "the important point we would like to stress is that rather different experimental data can be described using the same hypothesis on the production and the emission of clusters .",
    "a detailed comparison of the models with the experimental data can be found in @xcite . here , we first concentrate on nucleon - induced reactions .",
    "figure [ fig : clus5 ] shows a comparison between the kinetic energy differential cross - section of light clusters calculated with n - ipse and data @xcite .",
    "note that there is no normalization between the data and the calculation . as a reference ,",
    "we also show ( right part of the figure ) the calculated spectra obtained with gnash@xcite . a good agreement between the results of n - ipse and the experimental data",
    "is obtained .",
    "this is true for a wide range of beam energy from @xmath15 mev to @xmath16 mev in both proton and neutron induced reactions on medium and heavy nuclei .",
    "concerning nucleus nucleus reactions , a systematic comparison with the indra data@xcite have demonstrated that the hipse model is able to reproduce not only the average properties @xcite but also the fluctuations of the experimental observables@xcite .",
    "it appears that besides mean properties and fluctuations , `` internal '' correlations inside each event are also correctly reproduced as shown in figure [ fig : clus6 ] @xcite where the distribution of the relative velocity ( top ) and the relative angle ( bottom ) between the three largest fragments taken two - by - two are presented for the reaction xe+sn at three different beam energies ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 mev / a ) . in each case , the calculated spectra are compared with the indra data @xcite .",
    "the very good agreement between hipse and the indra data gives additional proof of the compatibility between the rules for the production and the emission of complex particles and the experimental observables .",
    "note that a similar agreement has been is found in different symmetric systems .",
    "we have described simple rules that may be used to describe the pre - equilibrium emission of clusters in the course of nuclear reactions .",
    "these rules are based on a random sampling of the nucleons taking into account the fermi motion and a proper account of nuclear effects as well as the conservation laws .",
    "using these rules leads to a good agreement with data obtained from nucleus - nucleus reactions around the fermi energy and surprisingly also for nucleon - nucleus reactions .",
    "we would like to mention , that even if the complete randomness hypothesis appears compatible with the experimental data , this do not give any indication on the physical origin of randomness and several effects can be invoked : phase - transition , turbulence , self - organized criticality , quantum decoherence ...",
