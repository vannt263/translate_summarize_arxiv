    "the significant luminosity spread observed in hertzsprung - russell ( hr ) diagrams of star forming regions ( sfrs ) and young clusters is a well known feature , which has been confirmed with the improvement of observational techniques ( see hillenbrand 2008 and references therein ) .",
    "whether this luminosity spread arises from a physical process , observational uncertainties or reveals a significant age spread is a crucial question , with important consequences on our understanding of star formation ( hartmann 2001 ) .",
    "this hypothetical age spread is used as an argument in favour of a slow star formation process , in conflict with other observational constraints and our current understanding of star formation ( hartman 2001 ; ballesteros - paredes & hartmann 2007 ) .",
    "motivated by this controversy , we have conducted a systematic analysis of how accretion affects the evolution of young low mass stars ( lms ) and brown dwarfs ( bds ) in order to explore the sensitivity of evolutionary tracks to the early accretion history . in this letter , we present the first consistent evolutionary models for young lms and bds taking into account non - steady accretion phases at very early stages of the evolution .",
    "we show that this scenario can explain at least partly the observed luminosity spread in hr diagrams , without invoking an age spread .",

    "this stems from the fact that , as mass builds up , the object s thermal timescale @xmath54 rapidly increases , and becomes much longer than the accreting timescale @xmath55 , so that rapid increase of gravitational energy is the only possibility to adjust to the accreting energy flow . for example , the case b sequence ( solid blue line in figs .",

    "our results show that a scenario based on early stages of non - steady accretion , characterized by short duration ( a few 100 yr ) episodes of vigorous accretion ( @xmath79 ) , followed by longer quiescent ( @xmath80 ) phases , naturally produces a spread in the hr diagram at ages of @xmath3 a few myr , providing non spherical accretion ( through disk or funnels ) occurs on a variety of proto - star / bd initial masses , from a few @xmath40 to a few tenths of @xmath41 .",
    "this scenario can easily produce a luminosity spread equivalent to an age spread of @xmath3 10 myr ( for non - accreting objects ) , even though the objects are just 1 or so myr old .",

    "a possible explanation is that they are significantly younger ( @xmath81 1 myr ) than the mean cluster age and experienced their episodic accretion phase quite recently .",

    "( 2007 ) , is that fast rotation and/or the presence of a magnetic field yields a smaller heat flux output , thus ( i ) a larger radius and ( ii ) a cooler @xmath2 , while barely affecting the luminosity , for a given mass .",

    "if our suggestion is correct , it has several drastic consequences : ( 1 ) what was interpreted as a significant age spread in sfrs or young clusters is essentially a spread in radius , thus in luminosity , for objects of comparable ages , ( 2 ) if young low - mass objects have experienced strong episodes of accretion during their embedded ( class 0 to i ) phase , their contraction proceeds very differently from a standard , constant @xmath2 , hayashi track and still keep memories of these early episodes after about a few myr , even if present accretion rates are negligible , ( 3 ) trying to infer the mass , thus an imf , for young ( @xmath82 old ) clusters from mass - luminosity or mass-@xmath2-sp type relationships based on non - accreting objects / models very likely leads to results of low significance , and inferring the imf for such young associations seems to be elusive . at this stage",

    "<S> we present evolutionary models for young low mass stars and brown dwarfs taking into account episodic phases of accretion at early stages of the evolution , a scenario supported by recent large surveys of embedded protostars . </S>",
    "<S> an evolution including short episodes of vigorous accretion ( @xmath0 ) followed by longer quiescent phases ( @xmath1 ) can explain the observed luminosity spread in hr diagrams of star forming regions at ages of a few myr , for objects ranging from a few jupiter masses to a few tenths of a solar mass . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitational contraction of these accreting objects strongly departs from the standard hayashi track at constant @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the best agreement with the observed luminosity scatter is obtained if most of the accretion shock energy is radiated away . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained luminosity spread at 1 myr in the hr diagram is equivalent to what can be misinterpreted as a @xmath3 10 myr age spread for non - accreting objects . </S>",
    "<S> we also predict a significant spread in radius at a given @xmath2 , as suggested by recent observations . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations bear important consequences on our understanding of star formation and early stages of evolution and on the determination of the imf for young ( @xmath4 a few myr ) clusters . </S>",
    "<S> our results also show that the concept of a stellar birthline for low - mass objects has no valid support . </S>"
