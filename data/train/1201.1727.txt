    "<S> the kuramoto model describes a system of globally coupled phase - only oscillators with distributed natural frequencies . the model in the steady state exhibits a phase transition as a function of the coupling strength , between a low - coupling incoherent phase in which the oscillators oscillate independently and a high - coupling synchronized phase . here </S>",

    "<S>   coupled oscillators that have their natural frequencies distributed according to a given distribution , for example , a gaussian , a lorentzian , or a uniform distribution , often exhibit collective synchronization in which a finite fraction of the oscillators oscillates with a common frequency . </S>",
    "<S> examples include groups of fireflies flashing in unison @xcite , networks of pacemaker cells in the heart @xcite , superconducting josephson junctions @xcite , and many others . </S>",
    "<S> understanding the nature and emergence of synchronization from the underlying dynamics of such systems is an issue of great interest . </S>",
    "<S> a paradigmatic model in this area is the so - called kuramoto model involving globally - coupled oscillators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although studied extensively in the past , the model continues to raise new questions , and has been a subject of active research ; for reviews , see @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> one issue that has been explored in recent years , and is also the focus of this paper , concerns the kuramoto model with uniformly distributed natural frequencies . in this case , it is known that in the limit of infinite system size , where size refers to the number of oscillators , the system in the steady state undergoes a first - order phase transition across a critical coupling threshold @xmath0 , from a low - coupling incoherent phase to a high - coupling synchronized phase . for values of the coupling </S>",
    "<S> constant slightly higher than @xmath0 , non - trivial relaxation dynamics has been reported , based on numerical simulations of large systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , it has been shown that initial incoherent states while evolving in time get stuck in metastable states before attaining synchronized steady states . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon has been demonstrated by the temporal behavior of the order parameter characterizing the phase transition , which shows a relaxation from the initial value of the order parameter to its final steady state value in step - like jumps . </S>",
    "<S> an aspect of the kuramoto model which is of interest and has been explored in some detail concerns finite - size effects @xcite , which may have important consequences , for example , for @xmath1 , in stabilizing the incoherent state which in the limit of infinite size is known to be linearly neutrally stable @xcite . in this context , it is important to investigate whether the metastable states mentioned above may be attributed to finite - size effects . in this paper , we systematically study this phenomenon of step - like relaxation . </S>",
    "<S> we provide numerical evidence to suggest that the observed metastability is indeed a finite - size effect , becoming an increasingly rare event with increasing system size .    </S>",
    "<S> the kuramoto model consists of @xmath2 phase - only oscillators labeled by the index @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> each oscillator has its own natural frequency @xmath4 distributed according to a given probability density @xmath5 , and is coupled to all the other oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> the phase of the oscillators evolves in time according to @xcite = _ </S>",

    "<S> the kuramoto model has been mostly studied for a unimodal @xmath5 , i.e. , one which is symmetric about the mean frequency @xmath10 , and which decreases monotonically and continuously to zero with increasing @xmath11 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , it is known that in the limit @xmath12 , the system of oscillators in the steady state undergoes a continuous transition at the critical threshold @xmath13 . for @xmath14 , </S>",
    "<S> each oscillator tends to oscillate independently with its own natural frequency . on the other hand , for @xmath15 , </S>",
    "<S> the coupling synchronizes the phases of the oscillators , and in the limit @xmath16 , they all oscillate with the mean frequency @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the degree of synchronization in the system at time @xmath18 is measured by the complex order parameter ( t)=r(t)e^i(t)=_j=1^n e^i_j(t ) , with magnitude @xmath19 and phase @xmath20 , in terms of which the time evolution ( [ timeevolution ] ) may be written as = _ </S>",

    "<S> timeevolution1 here @xmath19 with @xmath21 measures the phase coherence of the oscillators , while @xmath20 gives the average phase . when @xmath22 is smaller than @xmath0 , the quantity @xmath19 while starting from any initial value relaxes in the long - time limit to zero , corresponding to an incoherent phase in the steady state . for @xmath23 , on the other hand , @xmath19 grows in time to asymptotically saturate to a non - zero steady state value @xmath24 that increases continuously with @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the relaxation of @xmath19 to steady state is exponentially fast for @xmath15 . for @xmath1 , however , the nature of relaxation depends on @xmath5 . </S>",

    "<S> for example , for a lorentzian @xmath5 , and a specific initial condition , @xmath19 decays exponentially to zero @xcite . for other choices of @xmath5 in this class and for other initial conditions , the dependence of @xmath19 on time </S>",
    "<S> is not known analytically , and it has been speculated that @xmath19 is a sum of decaying exponentials @xcite .    in the limit @xmath12 , the state of the oscillator system at time @xmath18 </S>",
    "<S> is described by the probability distribution @xmath26 that gives for each natural frequency @xmath27 the fraction of oscillators with phase @xmath28 at time @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of @xmath26 satisfies the continuity equation for the conservation of the number of oscillators with natural frequency @xmath27 , and is given by a non - linear partial integro - differential equation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent analytical studies for a unimodal @xmath5 ( specifically , a lorentzian ) and for two different bimodal @xmath5 s ( given by a suitably defined sum and difference of two lorentzians ) demonstrated by considering a restricted class of @xmath26 , and by employing an ansatz due to ott and antonsen that the time evolution in terms of the integro - differential equation may be exactly reduced to that of a small number of ordinary differential equations ( odes ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the odes for the reduced system contain the whole spectrum of dynamical behavior of the full system . </S>",
    "<S> the ott - antonsen ansatz has also been applied to various globally and nonlinearly coupled oscillators with uniformly distributed frequencies @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a uniform @xmath5 with a compact support does not qualify as a unimodal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in this case , it is known that in the limit @xmath12 , the kuramoto model in the steady state exhibits a first - order phase transition between an incoherent and a synchronized phase at the critical coupling @xmath29 @xcite . for large @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , numerical studies of the relaxation of an initial state with uniformly distributed phases have demonstrated that for values of @xmath22 around @xmath0 in the supercritical regime , the process occurs as a step - like jump in @xmath19 from its initial to the steady state value . </S>",
    "<S> one may interpret this behavior as suggesting the existence of metastable states in the system @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> let us note that in the kuramoto model , one simulation run of the dynamics differs from another in that it corresponds to ( i ) a different realization of the set of initial phases @xmath41 , and ( ii ) a different realization of the set of natural frequencies @xmath42 . in order to distinguish between the effects of the two , we performed two sets of simulations , by fixing the initial @xmath31 s and running simulations for different realizations of the @xmath37 s , and vice versa .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] , the quantity @xmath19 jumps in a step from the initial to the final steady state value corresponding to a synchronized phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , an important difference is that across realizations , there is a wide range of values of the jump time or the relaxation time @xmath43 . for realization 2 </S>",
    "<S> , the system settles into a partially synchronized state . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have checked that this state is not the true steady state , the latter being a synchronized state , the relaxation to which takes place at very long times . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the partially synchronized state may be interpreted as only a metastable state . from the above numerical experiment , </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the occurrence of the metastable state is dependent on the realization of the frequency distribution only , as we had kept the initial @xmath31 s fixed in the experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> let us mention a different way to demonstrate the reluctance of some frequency realizations to relax to a synchronized state , as observed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , by performing the following numerical experiment . from the realizations depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] that relax to the synchronized state within the time duration shown , the typical relaxation time @xmath44 may be estimated . in simulations , we prepared the system in a homogeneous state , as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , and tuned the coupling parameter @xmath22 cyclically , from low to high values and back , while simultaneously measuring the order parameter @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> we tuned @xmath22 at a rate much smaller than the inverse of @xmath44 , thereby ensuring that the system during the course of tuning of @xmath22 remains close to the instantaneous steady state at all times . </S>",
    "<S> the result is the hysteresis loop depicted in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] . for one of the realizations depicted in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] that is relaxing within the time duration shown , say , the realization @xmath46 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] shows the corresponding plot of @xmath45 vs. @xmath22 , illustrating hysteretic behavior . </S>",
    "<S> such a behavior is expected of a first - order transition , as is the case here in the model with uniformly distributed frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> one may observe from the hysteresis plot that the value of @xmath22 used in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , namely , @xmath34 , is well outside the hysteresis loop where the only stable state is the synchronized state . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . for a realization in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] that is not relaxing within the time duration shown , say , the realization @xmath47 , the value @xmath34 lies within the corresponding hysteresis loop displayed in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the latter shows that at this value of @xmath22 , the stable state of the system is indeed not a synchronized state , but a non - synchronized state , consistent with fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> however , note that for this realization , the actual relaxation time evident from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] is actually much larger than @xmath44 , thus demanding that @xmath22 be tuned at a slower rate than the one used to obtain fig . </S>",

    "<S> this observation , combined with our result that @xmath19 when averaged over a large number of realizations of @xmath37 s for a finite system does not show any step - like relaxation , suggests that in the thermodynamic limit , the relaxation of @xmath19 occurs as a smooth process . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the probability distribution of the steady state value @xmath57 of the order parameter , displayed in figure [ fig6 ] , shows that with increasing system size , the distribution is more and more peaked at a value close to one , while the probability to obtain any other value gets negligibly smaller . </S>",
