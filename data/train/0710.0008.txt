    "dissociative electron attachment ( dea ) to the water molecule proceeds through a number of channels , each with a different energetic threshold , @xmath4 the production of these species occurs via three metastable born - oppenheimer electronic states of the h@xmath3o@xmath5 system , whose vertical transition energies therefore determine the incident energies at which dea occurs .",
    "those electronic states of the anion are the @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 feshbach resonances , and they are responsible for the three distinct peaks in the dea cross section .",
    "their potential - energy surfaces contain asymptotes corresponding to the product channels listed in eq.([asymptotes ] ) , with the exception of the h+oh@xmath5 channel ; this product is a result of nonadiabatic effects .    here",
    "we report the construction of the complex - valued adiabatic potential - energy surfaces associated with these resonance states , which will be used within the local complex potential ( lcp ) model @xcite to calculate the nuclear dynamics leading to dissociation . the present study is followed by a second paper@xcite , to which we will refer as paper ii , in which we present the results of nuclear dynamics calculations under the lcp model using the calculated surfaces .",
    "dissociative electron attachment to water was studied as early as 1930 , in the experiment of lozier@xcite , and as recently as 2006 , in the study by fedor _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "these two experiments , along with the rest of the prior theoretical and experimental work on this subject@xcite , have succeeded in characterizing each of the product channels of eq.([asymptotes ] ) and the three feshbach resonances involved in their production . however , prior to our recent theoretical study of dea to water via the lowest - energy @xmath0 resonance@xcite , there had been no complete theoretical treatment of this process , nor , in fact , any _ ab initio _ treatment of dissociative attachment to any molecule , involving more than one nuclear degree of freedom",
    ". we will give a more complete summary of the prior theoretical and experimental results concerning the dynamics of this process in paper ii .",
    "the present treatment supersedes our previous study of dea via the lowest - energy @xmath0 state .",
    "we have also studied the angular dependence of dea to h@xmath3o and h@xmath3s via the @xmath0 state of either anion  @xcite .",
    "additionally , we previously presented a qualitative study of the topology of the potential - energy surfaces of these three electronic states  @xcite , including the many intersections that these surfaces exhibit . that qualitative study informs the present study ,",
    "in which we construct quantitative surfaces .",
    "two of the most significant features of these surfaces can be seen in fig .",
    "[ c2vfig ] , reproduced here from ref.@xcite .",
    "this figure depicts the behavior of the resonance energies with respect to the h - o - h bending angle @xmath6 , fixing the oh bond lengths at @xmath7=@xmath8=1.81@xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 resonances are degenerate at linear geometry ; this degeneracy will lead to renner - teller coupling between the two states .",
    "in addition , there is a conical intersection between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 surface located at approximately @xmath6=73@xmath10 .",
    "this conical intersection plays a crucial role for the nuclear dynamics of dea via the uppermost @xmath2 resonance state",
    ".     in @xmath11 geometry , plotted with respect to bending angle , in degrees . ]",
    "the presence of a conical intersection between the adiabatic @xmath1 and @xmath2 states means that the nuclear dynamics calculations that employ these potential - energy surfaces must either explicitly include the coupling between them , or be performed in a diabatic basis with a smooth coupling term .",
    "we perform an approximate diabatization of the calculated adiabatic @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( 1 and 2 @xmath12 ) states to produce diabatic @xmath1 and @xmath2 surfaces .",
    "this diabatization is based upon the diagonalization of a particular symmetry operation described in sec .",
    "[ sec : diab ] , not the explicit minimization of derivative matrix elements .",
    "a resonance state may be characterized by a width , @xmath13 , and an energy , @xmath14 , which are functions of the internuclear geometry @xmath15 .",
    "these quantities define a complex potential surface @xmath16 , @xmath17 the width @xmath13 is related to the lifetime as @xmath18 ( we use atomic units throughout ) . for a triatomic , the internal coordinates @xmath15 may be the set of bond - angle coordinates ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath19 ) .",
    "we use separate techniques to define the two components of the potential - energy surfaces , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we employ the complex kohn variational method  @xcite to perform scattering calculations which include the effect of the electronic continuum upon the anion state .",
    "these calculations yield both @xmath14 and @xmath13 , but we discard the value of @xmath22 obtained from them . in its place , we use bound - state configuration - interaction ( ci ) calculations to obtain @xmath14 .    in the asymptotic regions , the resonances become bound electronic states , and therefore the use of bound - state methods is entirely appropriate in those regions of nuclear geometry . near the franck - condon region where these states are resonances , our ci treatment restricts the included configuration space to eliminate the ground state electronic continuum from the calculation .",
    "thus our ci calculations neglect the shift in @xmath14 due to coupling with that continuum , a well - known effect explained by the feshbach resonance formalism @xcite .",
    "since the shift in @xmath14 by this coupling is generally of the same order as the width , @xmath13 , this is an excellent approximation in regions where the resonance is narrow .",
    "the three resonance states we treat here have as their dominant configuration an electron attached to a singly excited configuration of the neutral target ( feshbach resonances ) , and thus tend to have small widths . however , there are a some geometries where the width of one or the other of the two upper resonances is of the order of a few tenths of an ev , and in those regions the error in our calculated values of @xmath14 for that resonance are larger .",
    "we also define a ground - state neutral h@xmath3o potential surface .",
    "the resulting energetics of the anion surfaces relative to the ground state appear to reproduce the vertical transition energies and all but one of the two - body asymptotes of these resonances very well , without a relative vertical adjustment between the neutral and anion calculations .",
    "however , as we will describe in detail , the ci calculations fail to produce one of the two - body breakup asymptotes on one resonance surface , and we are forced to employ an _ ad hoc _ patching procedure with another ci to correct the unphysical behavior .",
    "a similar patching procedure was necessary to correctly describe the three body breakup asymptotes , but dynamics leading to them is not part of the study we will present in paper ii .",
    "the data points calculated at a large set of nuclear geometries are assembled into global representations of the potential - energy surfaces .",
    "we construct the global representations of the real part , @xmath14 , and the width , @xmath13 , separately .",
    "the global representations of the real parts of the adiabatic @xmath0 and the diabatic @xmath1 and @xmath2 surfaces are defined by a sum of an analytic fit and a spline of the residual error of this fit .",
    "we also define a global representation of the off - diagonal coupling between the diabatic states .",
    "the global representations of @xmath14 for the adiabatic @xmath1 and @xmath2 states are obtained as the eigenvalues of the 2@xmath232 hamiltonian matrix defined by the fitted diabatic surfaces . the adiabatic - to - diabatic transformation angle is applied to the constructed width surfaces to obtain diabatic widths .",
    "the final result is a complete set of complex potential surfaces for the full dynamics calculations we report in paper ii .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we begin in sec .",

    "the parent state of each corresponds to the analagous configuration [ h@xmath3o]@xmath334@xmath30 , which may be a singlet or a triplet .",
    "since the resonance states are doublets , both the singlet and triplet states of the neutral may be considered the parent state to which the incident electron is attached .",
    "the peaks in the dea cross section occur at approximately 6.5 , 8.4 , and 11.8ev , respectively , at the equilibrium geometry of the neutral ; these values approximate the vertical transition energies of the resonances .",
    "the ionization energy of h@xmath3o is 12.621ev .",
    "the vertical transition energy to excite the @xmath2 resonance is close this value and we can not eliminate the possibility that it is physically above the ionization energy .",
    "it is possible , therefore , that the parent state of the @xmath2 resonance is an autoionizing excited state of neutral h@xmath3oat least at some geometries .    from the equilibrium geometry of the neutral ,",
    "the resonance states may be followed adiabatically toward the two - body breakup arrangements in which the electron is attached to one of the fragments or h - oh or o - h@xmath3 .",
    "we identified the proper asymptotes in these two arrangements previously  @xcite .",
    "in the first of these arrangements , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 states correlate with h@xmath5+oh ( @xmath34 ) , while the @xmath2 state correlates with h@xmath5+oh ( @xmath35 ) , leaving the oh fragment excited . in the second ,",
    "the @xmath0 state correlates with ground - state h@xmath3+o@xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath1 state is found at a much higher energy , as h@xmath3(triplet 1@xmath361@xmath37)+o@xmath5 , and does not have a bound two - body asymptote in this arrangement .",
    "an additional complication is that the @xmath2 surface is inherently double - valued . as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , its lower asymptote is ground - state h@xmath3+o@xmath5 , while the upper asymptote of this surface in this arrangement is not electronically bound , and corresponds to o ( @xmath38 ) plus a resonant state of h@xmath39 . in our previous study",
    "@xcite , we did not determine which resonant state of h@xmath39 is involved .",
    "the double - valuedness of the @xmath2 surface presents a problem for our treatment because we are unable to fully characterize both sheets of this surface for all geometries .",
    "we instead define a single surface which interpolates between the two sheets within the three - body breakup region .",
    "we will attempt to identify any discrepancies between the results here and the experimental ones which we might ascribe to this omission .",
    "however , it is likely that this feature of the adiabatic manifold only plays a significant role for three - body breakup , a channel which we will not consider in paper ii .",
    "we do , however , include the @xmath1-@xmath2 conical intersection in the current treatment , because it is critical for a description of the dynamics of dissociative electron attachment via the @xmath2 state .",
    "this conical intersection is a consequence of the crossing of the 1@xmath40 and 3@xmath41 orbital energies as the bond angle is varied , and has analogs in both the singlet and triplet @xmath42 and @xmath43 states of the neutral , which exhibit conical intersections near the present one .    the symmetry labels @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 are appropriate when the h@xmath3o molecule has @xmath11 symmetry , i.e. , when the oh bond lengths are equal .",
    "when the oh bond lengths are unequal , the molecule belongs to the c@xmath44 point group .",
    "the appropriate symmetry labels in those geometries are @xmath45 , 1  @xmath12 , and 2 @xmath12 . due to the conical intersection",
    ", the lower ( 1 ) and upper ( 2 ) @xmath12 states may each correspond to either @xmath1 or @xmath2 , depending on the bond angle .",
    "a complete discussion of the topology of the anion surfaces is given in ref .",
    "the resonance positions and widths are extracted from the results of fixed - nuclei scattering calculations carried out at physical ( real ) energies .",
    "the scattering calculations yield an _ s _",
    "matrix whose energy dependence is analyzed to determine the location of the resonance pole in the complex energy plane as a function of nuclear geometry .",
    "these calculations are fully _ ab initio_. we use the complex kohn variational method  @xcite , which provides a stationary principle for the _ s _ matrix . since detailed descriptions of the method have been given elsewhere @xcite , we will limit ourselves here to a brief summary to establish the terminology we will use to describe our numerical calculations .",
    "the ( @xmath46)-electron scattering wavefunction is represented explicitly in this calculation , using the standard methods of quantum chemistry : one - electron molecular orbitals are assembled as sums of multicenter contracted cartesian gaussian functions , products of which define @xmath47-electron configuration state functions used to construct the target states .",
    "this basis , augmented with additional gaussian functions and numerical continuum functions to describe the scattered waves , is also used to expand the ( @xmath46)-electron wave function .",
    "thus , key components of this calculation include the appropriate choice of one - electron orbital and multielectron configuration bases defining the target states and the resonance state . not only must the resonance state be accurately represented , but also the target states into which it decays .",
    "this requirement becomes more difficult with increasing resonance energy , as more target states become energetically accessible as decay channels .      in our implementation of the complex kohn variational method",

    "the functions @xmath54 in eq.([eq : channelfcn ] ) , which we denote as `` scattering orbitals '' , are gaussian molecular orbitals that are orthogonal to the `` target orbitals '' used to construct the target states @xmath55 .",
    "thus , one of the first steps in the complex kohn calculation is the partitioning of the one - electron hilbert space into the sets of target and scattering orbitals .",
    "the functions @xmath56 and @xmath57 in eq.([eq : channelfcn ] ) are constructed from products of radial functions ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) times angular functions that are real - valued combinations of spherical harmonics @xmath60 consistent with the spatial symmetry of the anion .",
    "these functions are then schmidt orthogonalized to the target and scattering molecular orbitals .",
    "the function @xmath58 is the regular ricatti - bessel function , while @xmath61 is a numerically generated continuum function that is regular at the origin and behaves asymptotically like the outgoing riccatti - hankel function : @xmath62 it is obtained by solving the driven radial equation , @xmath63 subject to the stated boundary conditions . for all calculations presented here ,",

    "are included in the sum in eq.([eq : channelfcn ] ) ; the continuum functions @xmath65 and @xmath66 are not included .",

    "matrices that are discontinuous across channel thresholds . to minimize this problem",
    ", we include additional diffuse gaussian functions in the scattering orbital basis to represent the wavefunction in barely - bound channels . in any case",
    ", the resonance energies can be formally discontinuous across channel thresholds ; their discontinuities are not due to errors in the calculation , but instead are properties of the true resonance states  @xcite .    the second sum in eq.([eq : trialwf ] )",
    "is over square - integrable ( @xmath46)-electron configurations @xmath67 constructed exclusively from target orbitals . for convenience we refer to the ( @xmath46)-electron configurations as the `` _ _ q _ _ space '' and to the close - coupling part of the expansion of the wavefunction as the `` _ _ p _ _ space '' of the calculation .",
    "space may be further divided into the bound componentbuilt from ( @xmath46)-electron configurations incorporating only gaussian orbitalsand the  free \" component , corresponding to the target states times continuum functions .",
    "two approximations are made in calculating the matrix elements of the electronic hamiltonian with respect to the antisymmetrized basis functions of eq.([eq : trialwf ] ) .",
    "the exchange portion of all matrix elements within _ p _ space that involve  free \" components , as well as the matrix elements between _ q _ space and the free components of _ p _ space , are assumed to be zero .",
    "these approximations follow from the orthogonalization of the free functions to the bound molecular orbitals and the assumed completeness of the combined sets of target + scattering orbitals over the restricted region of space spanned by the target orbitals .",
    "errors associated with these approximations are minimized by keeping the target orbitals compact and by augmenting the set of scattering orbitals with functions that extend beyond the target orbitals so that the orthogonalized continuum functions are separated from the target orbitals by a large region of space .",
    "further details concerning these approximations can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",

    "the real part of this surface is similar to that of the @xmath0 surface , having the same asymptotes , but is everywhere higher ( except at linear @xmath6=180@xmath10 where they are degenerate ) , and is highest above the @xmath0 surface along the conical intersection seam , that intersects this figure at @xmath6=75@xmath10 at ( @xmath7=@xmath8=2.3@xmath9 ) , which point is marked with a dot in the figure .",
    "the conical intersection seam is roughly parallel to the grain of the cut , and falls within the plane @xmath7=@xmath8 .",

    "the imaginary component of this state is much different from that of the @xmath0 state , being in general higher within the franck - condon region , and having the large ( 0.1ev ) peaks in the exit wells just as the resonance becomes bound as h@xmath5+oh .",
    "these peaks are a consequence of the a symmetry of the resonance , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . they will lead to a large rate of autodetachment in this channel , and an isotope effect in the cross sections for h@xmath3o versus d@xmath3o that is disproportionate to the entrance amplitude , as discussed in ref .",
    "they also may portend the breakdown of the lcp model near these geometries , for they indicate that the 1  @xmath12 state may exist as a virtual state there .",
    "we examine this issue more fully in paper ii .",
